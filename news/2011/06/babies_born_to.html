	<p>Ethnic minorities now make up the majority of babies in the United States, official figures revealed today.</p>
<p>It is the first time that this has been the case and the change reflects a growing age divide between mostly white, older Americans and predominantly minority youths that could reshape government policies.</p>
<p>Preliminary census estimates also show the share of African-American households headed by women  &mdash;  made up of mostly single mothers  &mdash;  now exceeds African-American households with married couples, a sign of declining U.S. marriages overall but also continuing challenges for black youths without involved fathers.</p>
<p>The findings, based on the latest government data, offer a preview of final 2010 census results being released this summer that provide detailed breakdowns by age, race and householder relationships such as same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Demographers say the numbers provide the clearest confirmation yet of a changing social order, one in which racial and ethnic minorities will become the U.S. majority by the middle of the century.</p>
<p>Currently, non-Hispanic whites make up just under half of all three-year-olds, which is the youngest age group shown in the Census Bureau&rsquo;s October 2009 annual survey, its most recent. </p>
<p>In 1990, more than 60 per cent of children in that age group were white.</p>
<p>The preliminary figures are based on an analysis of the Current Population Survey as well as the 2009 American Community Survey, which sampled three million U.S. households to determine that whites made up 51 per cent of babies younger than two. </p>
<p>After taking into account a larger-than-expected jump in the minority child population in the 2010 census, the share of white babies falls below 50 per cent.</p>
<p>By contrast, whites make up the vast majority of older Americans  &mdash;  80 per cent of the over 65s and roughly 73 per cent of people aged 45-64.</p>
<p>Kenneth Johnson, a sociology professor and senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire, noted that much of the race change is being driven by increases in younger Hispanic women having more children than white women, who have lower birth rates and as a group are moving beyond their prime childbearing years.</p>
<p>The numbers come amid public debate over hotly contested federal and state issues, from immigration and gay marriage to the rising cost of government benefits, that are resonating in different ways by region and demographics.</p>
<p>Alabama became the latest state this month to pass a wide-ranging anti-immigration law, which in part requires schools to report students&rsquo; immigration status to state authorities.</p>
<p>That follows tough immigration measures passed in similarly Republican-leaning states such as Georgia, Arizona and South Carolina.</p>
<p>But governors in Massachusetts, New York and Illinois, which long have been home to numerous immigrants, have opted out of the federal Secure Communities programme that aims to deport dangerous criminals, saying it has made illegal immigrants afraid of reporting crimes to police. California may soon opt out as well.</p>
<p>While the number of black single mothers has been gradually declining, overall marriages among blacks are decreasing faster. </p>
<p>That reflects a broader U.S. trend of declining marriage rates as well as increases in non-family households made up of people living alone, or with unmarried partners or other non-relatives.</p>
<p>Female-headed households make up a 19 per cent share among Hispanics and 9 per cent each for whites and Asians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, figures released last month revealed that the migration of young Hispanic families has fuelled the age divide between regions of America.</p>
<p>Young Hispanic migrant families are increasingly moving into western and southern states, while older baby boomers stay put further north.</p>
<p>The population in the South and West is now dramatically younger than in the Northeast, and there is a gap of 3.9 years between the youngest and oldest regions of the country, according to figures released by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p>In all, 12 of the 14 states with median ages of 36 or younger are located in the South and West, including California, Colorado and Georgia, whereas 13 of the 20 states with a median age of 38 or higher are in the Midwest and Northeast, including New Jersey, Rhode Island and Connecticut.</p>
<p>Younger people are increasingly leaving these areas  &mdash;  particularly industrial cities in the Midwest like Detroit which have been badly affected by the recession  &mdash;  to find work in the Sun Belt.</p>
<p>But ageing is being slowed in the South and West, as young Hispanic migrants settle and have families, while others continue to move in.</p>
<p>Another intriguing recent study has revealed that college-educated immigrants now outnumber those entering the country with just a high school degree  &mdash;  and the variation is much bigger in urban areas.</p>
<p>They outnumber those educated at high school by 25 per cent in 44 major American cities  &mdash;  and 30 per cent of working-age immigrants now have a college degree, compared to 19 per cent in 1980.</p>
<p>An increase in demand from U.S. employers has seen more college-educated immigrants arriving in the U.S. over the past decade than immigrants without high school education, reported Yahoo News.</p>
<p>Only 28 per cent of U.S. immigrants are without a high school diploma and half of skilled immigrants are overqualified for their jobs, a report by the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. said.</p>

		<p>Detroit was once mostly white and a beautiful city.  Now it is mostly black and a disaster.</p>
<p>I think the entire USA is going to look like Detroit in about 50 years.  If you have kids and grand kids, be afraid, very afraid. </p>
<p>I saw a good program on the History International channel last night.  I think the show was called Earth 2100.  It was mostly focused on climate change but it did address the population explosion in the third world.  Scary stuff.<br>

		<p>Wonderful. My children are going to grow up being hated due to the color of their skin. Why? Because the liberal fools of MY generation gave their country away to third world invaders.</p>
<p>Do you think these &#8220;people of color&#8221; will fund Medicare and Social Security for old &#8220;whitey&#8221;? It is going to be very, very intersting when all these 60&rsquo;s liberal socialist democrats see their government entitlements disappear when their lovely minority friends vote to reduce the payments. Then, they may, just may, have their racial epiphany. But, alas, it will be too late.</p>
<p>Will there be any safe place for whites in 30 years? This world is going to be horrible when the &#8220;people of color&#8221; get control. One huge smelly, stinking, starving, violent &#8220;Detroit&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The tipping point has been reached&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not kidding that where I&rsquo;m at, I don&rsquo;t see more than one or two white babies IN A GOOD YEAR on average.  I saw a white baby today at a restaurant.  It&rsquo;s been so long I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare, if only to remember what a white baby looks like.  I am not exaggerating.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, in the northeast, it is 100% Mexican in that neighborhood, 80%/20% Asian/Mexican in that neighborhood, 100% black over there, and so on.</p>
<p>The only whites left are the few older stragglers, a few hipster enclaves, some white &#8216;ethnics&rsquo; neighborhoods.  Real, founding stock Americans like myself are almost non-existent.</p>

		<p>This news on the day that a national tire brand hits the TV with its new commercial.  The little girl is of indeterminate race, and has facial characteristics that seem to blend Mexican, Oriental, and Afro, but all softened enough to betray a mixture of White blood stolen from the womb of one of our own.  </p>
<p>You know what education will look like in the future, but let&rsquo;s get the prediction made here:</p>
<p>White parents of minoritized White children will never demand that their children be given any minority privileges or advancement, because to do so would be racist.  Only a racist parent would promote their own child&rsquo;s interests based on racial identity, only a White parent that is- all others are permitted to do it and demand more and more, and get it.</p>
<p>Minority White children will see so many TV and print advertisements that mix the one White children with blacks, Mexicans, Muslims, and Orientals, that our own children will feel that their minority status is right, justified, and desirable.</p>
<p>Minority White children will be taught in school that America has made great advancements since the time of White majorities when slavery, segregation, and prejudice were all legal. It wasn&rsquo;t until those things were outlawed that Whites finally accepted their proper place and began to concede to their own minoritization.  White minority = social justice, and Whites wanted it, so it is good.  White children will agree with everything they are taught.</p>
<p>Why no resistance?  Because White Humanity is spent.  We would not be in this circumstance if we still had our natural instinct of self-preservation.  </p>
<p>A friend of ours predicts that the nation will split apart along racial and ethnic lines.  We said no, because a White Humanity that would do that wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed ourselves to get is such a race emergency as we find ourselves.</p>
<p>What about that rare White minority who asks why anchor babies were allowed to become citizens and breed more citizens to the point the Whites were minioritized in their own country and now are ruled by the mulattos who care nothing of law and liberty?   That too inquisitive Whitey will make himself even rarer, because he will mysteriously disappear, and all others will agree that some questions just shouldn&rsquo;t be asked, because they only dredge up a shameful and painful past that we&rsquo;ve all moved beyond.</p>
<p>Folks, it&rsquo;s over.  Withdraw and withhold.  You can&rsquo;t support anything but your own family and house.  Give nothing to integrated churches or any other charity.  Everything you give will be donated to the acceleration of your misery index.   </p>
<p>We had a good run, but we made a fatal miscalculation.  Non whites have never been and never will be Whites with dark skin.  They are different in ways only they can comprehend, and they know that our high IQs and &#8220;compassionate hearts&#8221; blind us to the iron laws of nature.  </p>
<p>But those laws are fixed, and we are expendable. </p>
<p>White privilege just wasn&rsquo;t sustainable.  Now that we&rsquo;ve lost ours, let&rsquo;s help the rich, liberal elite Whites get unburdened of theirs!   </p>

		<p>I first heard this news on MSNBC this morning, and the white commentator, of course, was completely nonchalant about it. Along with this, there was going to later be a discussion on a book about how we&rsquo;re entering a &#8220;post-racial society,&#8221; with Rev. Al Sharpton to provides his insights on this - at this point I turned off the program.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what to say except that matters are accelerating much faster than we had expected. At the same time, surveys are showing that whites are perceiving higher levels of discrimination against them. This sense of lack of empowerment and being the &#8220;low minority on the totem pole&#8221; as far as positions in education and jobs could eventually raise the racial consciousness level among young people of European descent. If a watershed event occurred, such as a total economic collapse involving hyper-inflation, politics could suddenly shift towards a political party that would unabashedly support white interests. Don&rsquo;t give up yet!</p>

		<p>Look into the horrors of the future.  When the majority of our congressional representatives are non White, and the majority of the investment, business, and real estate wealth is still in White ownership, what do you think the tax code will evolve into?</p>
<p>Whites should not expect to be allowed to keep anything.  The tax code will take away your retirement accounts, stocks and bonds, etc., in the name of social, restorative, and redistributive justice.  Your having wealth will be an &#8220;oppressive inequity&#8221; that must be righted by an enlightened and compassionate new tax law.  </p>
<p>When Whites are a minority, we simply will no longer have the protection of our votes in enough numbers to put Whites in congress.  </p>
<p>Just look at how bad America is for Whites when we ARE the majority.  Now imagine these present horrors increasing rapidly.  Whites are destined for the most horrid fate known in the history of the world.   We will suffer a degradation we thought was impossible except for the worst of the Congo jungles and Aztec blood rituals.</p>
<p>We did it to ourselves.  Suffering is our sure fate when greatness was our intended destiny.  I&rsquo;m ashamed to be White, not for what we did to the blacks, but because of what we did FOR the blacks and mexicans that enables them in what they are about to DO to us.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, our only option is to transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your nightmares, and you are extremely right&hellip;  but how will you explain it to your White children without running the risk that they will report you to their teachers and state DFACs for being a racist?  <br>

<p>from the evidence I have seen, it is better for them not to be around their fathers, who are usually in prison already. The last time a black boy was with his father, they robbed a man.</p>

<p>I am a 23 yr old woman, I have 1 child who is 4. I have been trying to have more, but have yet to succeed. I want 14 more children. how many more White children must be born for our decline to reverse? If this was some special protected minority that was losing numbers this fast, the government would ban abortions for women of that race. Oh wait, the White race is a minority in the world!  But we are not protected. Too many of our people are killed. We need armor, the race war has begun.</p>

		<p>My husband and I just had our second child a month ago today. I am hoping to try for a third in a year or so before age really gets in the way. A guess to why many Whites do not have more children would be the outragous hospital bills that are incurred even with insurance. We were given a discount if we paid upfront for the portion that our insurance would not cover and it still was around 900.00. And that was just the hospital! Other out of pocket costs incurred before the deductable was met and paying for the insurance itself was around 400.00 a month. I figured we paid for our own child and about 2-3 anchor babies who did not qualify for medicaid and skipped out on the medical bills. Some might opt for a home birth to save money but this is not an option for many, including myself. One other reason that minorities outbreed Whites is that White girls buy into the &#8220;you have to have a career&#8221; line fed to us by public and increasing numbers of private schools. If a minority girl starts having kids at 16-17 and a White woman waits until she is 30 and buys into the line that it is somehow horribly &#8220;dangerous&#8221; to have kids after 35 then who is going to be able to have more kids? I am not saying girls need to start having kids that early but instead of having an expensive and generally useless 4 year liberal arts degree get a nursing or other certification and begin having kids at 20-21. </p>

		<p>What is sickening is that this has been deliberate! This is Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s legacy -through his traitorous 1965 immigration act -or should it be called the 1965 Genocide Act. Add to that the fact that welfare is nothing more than eugenics -aimed not at improving the breed but at wrecking the gene pool. Thene there is the endless stream of propaganda in schools and coming from Hollywood -with its obvious use of the Frankfurt School playbook.</p>
<p>It is all so Machiavellian, someone earlier commented about these kind of things stemming from the best of intentions -quite frankly, I doubt it. These things all together have been coldly and deliberately done with no thought whatsoever about the &#8216;best intentions&rsquo; -except among the useful idiots who were duped into believing the likes of Ted &#8216;where&rsquo;d I leave the girl&rsquo; Kennedy when he baldly lied about how his immigration act would &#8216;not change the face of America.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Ever since the 1990&rsquo;s, the ethnic-cleansing of America has been going full bore ahead -with the media cheerleading the end of &#8216;traditional&rsquo; and &#8216;white&rsquo; America; hardly concealing their pleasure at the thought of minoritizing whites in our ancestral homelands, while at the same time trying to word their &#8216;news&rsquo; to make it seem as if this were somehow a natural event and not the calculated decimation of whites in general.</p>
<p>Even articles (quite recently) admit that &#8216;whites are having children later in life&rsquo; -while sidestepping the fact that whites have been putting off familys until they can afford children -while paying ever higher taxes to support Latrina and her six kids from fathers unknown. The productive are being punished for being responsible; while the utterly irresponsible are being rewarded and encouraged to breed even more endemic -dare I say genetic- irresponsibility. </p>
<p>The inmates are running the asylum, and I think I smell something burning&hellip;</p>

<p> If this news is true, then in about 20 years, non-white gangs will flourish, murdering whites and raping our women, to be white is to be a target.  Prepare yourselves everyone!  This is like an episode of the Twilight Zone.</p>

		<p>They must interview 4 sets of experts in the writing of this article. None of the experts are able to examine what this means for affirmative action policies in the US. Or how, examing the average incomes for the various groups, for the purpose of finding a need for affirmative action and social justice, they never seem to note or reveal that the incomes of 25 year old non-whites are being compared to the incomes of 45 year old whites. Would it even be &#8216;racist&rsquo; to note this? Regardless, they experts are not even comparing the same things. Older Americans of all races have higher incomes than those who are younger. Racial activism is a lot of work but sometimes there must be just too much work to do. They just can&rsquo;t be expected to tabulate everything.  </p>

		<p>DEMOGRAPHIC DISASTER</p>
<p>Yes friends the magnitude of the damage already done is horrifying and the future bodes to be worse as far as the numbers go. 1965 was the year that the prospective end of the historical American nation was hatched.</p>
<p>A few comments from my personal perspective. I&rsquo;m a longtime resident of Calif. and live in a very liberal and still quite white suburban whitopia in the Bay Area where, as a &#8216;conservative&rsquo; I am greatly in the political minority. I have followed the demographic issue for decades already (joined F.A.I.R. about 25 years ago, also Californians for Population Stabilization, U.S. English and others). As a nature lover conservationist I supported various prominent &#8216;environmentalist&rsquo; organizations like NRDC, Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy etc. I had to abandon the Sierra Club after 30 years when they sold out to the Democrats and flushed their longstanding platform plank acknowledging that all environmental problems are ultimately population based and achieving a stable population was essential. Now the SC says nothing about immigration-driven population growth in USA except to praise the god of Diversity and insist immigration cannot be a SC issue whatsoever.</p>
<p>I am sure we are all frustrated at the trend and the fierce regime of PC MC locked into most news media, academia, entertainment, political debate and just plain day to day social interaction.</p>
<p>WHAT TO DO? Obviously we need to fight numerous political battles but for now I just want to suggest a form of struggle for us to engage in on a personal daily life basis.</p>
<p>We must defy and discredit the PC MC rules, myths, fantasies and threats. We must be willing to engage the issue of our demographic disaster in conversation with our friends, neighbors and even casual acquaintance e.g. at the coffee house or park. We must start to say things that many have been afraid to say in fear of the &#8220;RACIST BIGOT&#8221; accusation. We need to man up, speak the truth, well-armed with the facts and the courage of our convictions and take the risk that someone will give us the evil eye. I don&rsquo;t mean get into shouting matches with people (though that may happen) nor to open up abruptly with full-blown WHITE IDENTITY talk. I mean starting off by gently slipping some these demographic facts into conversation, gently broaching the meaning of the &#8216;hate facts&rsquo; about differential statistics among racial/ethnic groups as to crime, educational achievement, welfare usage etc to prepare for the opportunity to turn the heat up a notch by sliding gently into IQ differences. Point out to people the curiosity of the phenomenon wherein any racial advocacy for the dwindling whites is taboo but you can&rsquo;t turn around without bumping into racial organization and strident advocacy for all non-white populations (BLACK BIKE WEEK ??) Another avenue of discussion is to mention the large changes Europe is undergoing (Islamization of course) so your listener can perhaps be lured into opining about a situation similar to our situation but &#8216;over there&rsquo; and involving a different non-white colonization so that the listener feels more free to opine about its undesirability.</p>
<p>The point is to normalize discussion that leads to the point that &#8216;race matters&rsquo; (and in Europe religion i.e. Islam matters) and that national identity matters and an America with a non-white majority is extremely consequential and simply will not be the historical American nation.</p>
<p>One more point - in discussing political candidates always raise the immigration (legal and illegal) issue and try to make people understand how supremely important it is. It&rsquo;s actually more important than the spending/debt crisis (hugely important though that is), the overreaching socialistic technocratic regulatory nanny state growth, and the unjustified international interventionism exemplified so well by the Libya non-hostilities (ha). In particular, no matter your position on abortion and &#8216;gay rights&rsquo; try to steer people away from making a candidate&rsquo;s position on those things a deal breaker or litmus test. If you are strongly &#8216;pro-life&rsquo; don&rsquo;t support a candidate who gets an A from your side on one or both of those issues if he/she gets an F or D on immigration from our point of view. Some things are simply more important, no disrespect intended.</p>
<p>THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE, ABOVE LITERALLY ALL OTHERS, MUST BE DEMOGRAPHICS AND &#8216;THE NATIONAL QUESTION&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And that paramount issue greatly effects virtually all others e.g. an increasingly third world U.S. population expands government spending, welfare, decreases resistance to socialism, degrades the public schools, degrades urban quality of life and to wind up where I started this discussion, makes conservation of our natural resources, open spaces, recreational areas and just plain natural beauty all the more difficult.</p>
<p>The point is to get the conversation started. I have been doing this and can tell you that depending of course on how you do it and whom you are speaking to, you may find that people are more receptive than you had imagined. Perhaps the best target is someone you know casually who is generally somewhat liberal but not a hardcore PC MC lefty and not intensely political. I call these people &#8216;inertia liberals&rsquo; meaning that they swim in a liberal sea, have absorbed a lot of unavoidable propaganda, spin and indoctrination (especially in college) and consider themselves generally liberal because it seems that most respectable people they encounter are liberal too. It&rsquo;s a default position but stands on weak ground if they are poorly informed and have never really had their nonsense beliefs (e.g. DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH - IQ IS JUST CULTURAL BIAS) challenged.</p>
<p>Jared long ago decided to speak the unspeakable, no matter the risks. Let&rsquo;s all try to be at least 1% as courageous as he and having learned from him try to be at least 10% as knowledgeable as he.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s respond to Eric &#8216;my people&rsquo; Holder&rsquo;s summons to an &#8216;honest conversation about race&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Start talking. Now. Think globally or nationally but act locally, right there in Starbucks or on that park bench or sharing beers at the local tavern.</p>
<p>If not you, then who? If not now, then when? The hour is late but more people than you think are ready to hear some truth and perhaps be a bit more honest with themselves and others in the future. BREAK THE TABOO.</p>

		<p>So, the balance has tipped, so be it.  It was just a matter of time before the neurotic, self hating white liberals crushed our race under their &#8221; white mans burden&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I have a 5 yr old daughter that I love more than life itself. My only regret is that she was born into a world that is starting to see the twilight of our once great race. My wife and I will do our best to teach her racial conciousness and pride in her race.</p>
<p>The one comforting thought I have is what will happen to black America once White America is no more and will  no longer be there to keep the lights on. By 2050 I have no doubt the USA will be a Liberia style Thunderdome where blacks and  self hating diversity loving whites will reap it utterly. </p>
<p>I suppose it is just as well that Whites go into that good night, the world will not be a pleasant place to be in the upcoming decades. Yes, we had a good run and were human civilizations finest hour, human history from her is all anti-climax.</p>

		<p>The fertility numbers are bad. Those of you who can are greatly encouraged to have more white kids. For those of you not so inclined, always remember that helping other whites have kids is similar to having the kids yourself. This is especially true in a society with other races. Scientists have calculated the numbers by counting genes. There are tables and figures and you can see where you fit in. So come up with your own personal ways of helping other whites with their kids. </p>

		<p>As Whites become minoritized, look for philanthropy to drop off, accompanied by the left&rsquo;s loud cries of &ldquo;too much hording by the White Privilege elites demands action in the form of higher pension taxes, investment surcharge taxes, and property taxes on the Whitey wealthy, and always more and more anti-racism training, sensitivity training, multicultural understanding training, diversity and inclusion training, and more and more protections for our underserved and threatened beloved communities of color!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Whites realize that their fathers&rsquo; institutions actively discriminate against us, we will be less likely to give money, especially now that money is devalued and harder to earn.</p>
<p>When we see the marketing and fundraising brochures for our alma maters and churches, we see black faces, which is far too much blackness for our sense of dignified White Humanity. We refuse to give so that White elites can pay themselves more money to discriminate against our kith in kin in favor of the afrovoodoos while publicizing anti-raciss virtue.</p>
<p>Giving money is an extension of self, and we don&rsquo;t extend ourselves to schools and churches that want blacks instead of God given Whites Only purity.</p>
<p>Civic engagement will collapse, because Whites will refuse to sacrifice for &ldquo;community&rdquo; when community is a black-brown-yellow-and-the-unmentionable-tribe coalition that rallies around &ldquo;hate Whitey&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;life, liberty, and happiness for ALL!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he needs a true people to serve. For he who is devoted to a mixed &lsquo;people,&rsquo; in other words to a human community without race or definite character, a &lsquo;people&rsquo; in name only, wastes his time&rdquo; -Savitri Devi, &ldquo;The Religion of the Strong&rdquo;</p>
<p>We Whites will eventually get tired of wasting our time and money helping the mixed &ldquo;other&rdquo;. The sooner, the better. Some of us are out ahead of the coming trend. Join us. Transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because the future is against you&hellip; hold tight to the past, hold tighter still to your money, and when you say your prayers, thank God that your ancestors gave you the sacred memory of Jim Crow segregation. Soon, everyone will know why White ancestor worship is returning with such force and power. We atone for the sins of diversity and the collapse of massive resistence by praising our Whites Only ancestors.</p>
<p><br>
We drove through a remote country cemetery in Dixieland and found a few Confederate veteran&rsquo;s graves, which we praised and saluted, as always. One was inscribed with the epitaph: &ldquo;He loved his neighborhood more than himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That would only be possible when Whites owned their own neighborhoods, schools, churches, governments, statesmen, heroes, monuments, names, etc. The Confederates lost the battle, but they won the War for Right. Our Race Realism confirms their correctness and good Order.</p>
<p>But now, anyone who loves his neighborhood more than himself is a self-hater, because neighborhoods are now Diversity, which is nothing more than a flagrantly hostile and dangerously anti-White environment.</p>
<p>Now, the best grave epitaph would be &ldquo;He fled his neighborhood when he couldn&rsquo;t keep out the afrovoodoo, mexican, and muslim diversity, and we praise and adore him for his good example- may we always remember him and imitate his righteous purity.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>I think the balkanization of America is probably enivitable. White Americans will never live with people of different races in close knit fashion. Never. Which makes this an even more terrifying story. White people can take flight only so many times before there is no were else to go. </p>
<p>The liberal culture and institutional anitracism programs have effectively silenced the truth about multiculturalism, crime rates, IQ Averages,etc. The thought of the US without a dominant White influence seriously makes me start laughing. </p>
<p>Mexicans with a 80 IQ, Blacks with their 75 IQ running the banking system, agriculture, The FED. Please. The country would collapse in a week. If this ever becomes a reality, welcome to the Congo. Detroit will seem like the garden of Eden compared to what America will look like. I still have hope things will change.</p>

<p>As usual, people here make ridiculous assertions completely unsupported by the facts.</p>
<p>There are about 1.1 to 1.2 billion people who most Amrenners would recognize as &lsquo;white&rsquo; (by &lsquo;caucasian&rsquo; I assume you mean white european).</p>
<p>There are significantly more whites than there are black Africans in the world.</p>
<p>Whites as a group are the second most numerous after East Asians (about 1.4 billion). Whites are more or less in the same ball park when it comes to absolute numbers as East Asians.</p>
<p>Of course if you want to throw in all Caucasoid types (Arabs, South Asians, Persians, North Africans, Turks) etc, then Caucasians would quite possibly outnumber Mongoloids (I&rsquo;m not sure  &mdash; have to do the arithmetic).</p>

<p>Hmmm my first one is due in January 2012, I am one of those hipsters you speak of, I am a 30 year old white guy living in a 95 percent Hispanic neighborhood, in NYC, I have no idea how my kid is going to get by in school since there is no conceivable way I could ever hope to send him/her to a private school given my salary and my unfathomable student loan debts.</p>
<p>I work for an extravagantly wealthy white man who lives in a mansion in Westchester and sends his children to the finest schools but who hasn&rsquo;t given a single employee a raise in years and years since the job market is so catastrophically awful almost nobody will quit.</p>
<p>My child will probably end up in a dysfunctional public school where whites are 2-3 percent of the population.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;responsible&#8221; thing would of course be not to have any kids at all, which unfortunately seems to be the thing more and more whites are concluding&hellip;</p>

<p>They developed a system of peaceful parallel co-existence which the commie <br>

<p>It seems to me that the solution for white folks is to return to Europe to create majority white societies<br>
The inequities of the 1600s no longer exist and they can re-establish themselves in civilised societies.</p>
<p>In the process they can displace the African minorities in Europe back to the lands of their birth and then we can all live and let live in peace and harmony according to our own standards.  </p>

It&rsquo;s also sad to know that me and my eventual family wont be afforded the safe, civilized, clean society as our predecessors intended. </p>
<p>JAK,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time lamenting. Join with other Euro-Americans in your age range and educate yourselves instead of listening to the nonsense that you&rsquo;ve probably been fed in school. I&rsquo;m guessing that you&rsquo;re a public school student. I&rsquo;ve witnessed the gradual decline of our society aided and abetted by our public schools over the almost half century of my teaching career. </p>
<p>Wherever you live can you honestly say that things are better due to &#8220;diversity&#8221;? </p>
<p>When I use the term diversity I&rsquo;m not referring to educated Asians and Hispanics but rather to the lowest of the low from Africa and Latin America and of course the Black ghettos. </p>
<p>This all started before you were born; the biggest offender being Ted Kennedy who changed immigration policy that pretty much excluded European immigration in favor of the dregs of the Third World. Between them and our home grown third worlders most of our large cities are disasters. </p>
<p>For years we Whites were told to limit our families to 2 children whereas non- Whites were never encouraged to limit their births and generous entitlements were granted to them to provide for their numerous out of wedlock children who have grown up to be the very people who assault, rape and murder us, who have denied supported them with our taxes. Come to think of it none of the Third World countries was admonished to respect THEIR environment either.</p>
<p>Get whatever amounts to a good education these days and  marry a wonderful White wife/husband (I don&rsquo;t know your sex) and have at least three kids. They&rsquo;re a joy. I have four young grandchildren about whose future I worry constantly. I had only two children because I too fell for the &#8220;responsibility&#8221; stuff during the late sixties. I regret it every day of my life along with friends who ingested the same garbage. Now they&rsquo;re feeding us a daily dose of the wonders of Islam whose adherents murder their own children (particularly girls who are treated just a little better than dogs. Yes they hate dogs too. How can anybody hate dogs?) who want to assimilate into American society.</p>
<p>Black murderers and rapists who convert to Islam in prison get out and hatch plots to kill our military personnel. Read today&rsquo;s news. This didn&rsquo;t all happen by chance. It&rsquo;s happening in every country that was once totally Caucasian. Western Europe is dying a slow death and Europeans haven&rsquo;t yet gotten the message.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;s still not too late to turn this around.  White people across this nation are beginning to awaken to the scam that&rsquo;s been perpetrated against us.  The Internet despite its many faults has permitted us to see what&rsquo;s really happening nationwide especially regarding the non-White on White violence. Now the &#8220;government&#8221; is talking about &#8220;controlling&#8221; the Internet.</p>
<p>They cannot be allowed to do that!</p>
<p>You and those like you are the only key to the survival of the Caucasian race. God Bless you.</p>

<p>Earth 2100 has been rebroadcasted quite a few times. And there are two other similar shows that have been rebroadcasted. Towards the end of the show, America no longer exist. Ruth&rsquo;s daughter has moved upstate NY with her husband George-Chinese &#8220;American.&#8221; Upstate NY is a collection violently feuding commuities using force and violence to protect the borders of their community. If you remember, Ruth&rsquo;s husband George-a botanist-is killed in the conflict upstate NY in a battle over scarce resources.</p>
<p>What is interesting about Earth 2100 is the the experts they had on are all political liberals who with hugh probability support nonwhite immigration&hellip;even though they point out that the endgame for America is massive overpopulation and violent racial conflict. Only goes to show that White Liberals are mentally insane. John Podesta-Bill Clinton&rsquo;s political advisor-during his interview on the show understood this obvious truth about &#8220;America&rsquo;s&#8221; future.</p>
<p>In hope Jared Taylor watched the show.</p>
<p>At this point in time, it is foolish to be making racial diffrences in IQ such an important part of case against nonwhte immigration&hellip;it is 100 percent irrelevant&hellip;.raise the race and IQ issue and you will with 100 percent certainty sidetrack the &#8220;debate&#8221; away from the race-replacement issue.</p>
<p>What Jared must do in his public appearances is confront his fellow Native Born White Americans with the cold brutality of what racial minority status will mean for Native Born White Americans</p>

		<p>I have a very elderly relative who has retained her sound mind and judgment, but who nevertheless believed this news story was saying that blacks are outbreeding whites by leaps and bounds.  (She lives in an area of SE Ohio that is only about 3% black and has only a handful of Hispanics.)  When I told her that the non-white increase is coming from Hispanics and that blacks abort half their babies and have hovered population-wise between 12-13% since the Civil War, she believed me  &mdash;  and was amazed that the TV news report had left her with the impression it did.  <br>
Many parts of Appalachia remain just as white, or even whiter, than SE OH.  Most American blacks live in big cities.  One doesn&rsquo;t (yet anyway) need a white homeland to get away from them.  Our really big concern is Hispanic expansion, and the main problem I personally perceive is the growing numbers of illegals, who are largely illiterate, unskilled, and often uncivilized.  THEY ARE OUR NATION&rsquo;S BIGGEST PROBLEM.  If we don&rsquo;t stop the onslaught, we needn&rsquo;t worry about anything else!  Our votes must reflect this in every election in which we vote!</p>

		<p>Whites have no unity, we spend all our time bickering among each other blind to what is before our very eyes. The retribution our children will face will be appalling. You only have to look to the large liberal cities to see what looms on the horizon. Think things are bad now? wait till the tax base dwindles away to nothing, how many business will stay in this country when the tax rate is 80% and who will support the masses when the Government has no money. You cannot hide from this or make preparations against it. America is now only the land of the handout and benefit, The land of opportunity is now a dream old and faded never to be seen again.</p>

		<p>This is bad news for most whites, but good news for the white oligarchy that owns and runs the United States. It means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. It also means a white population that is more likely to vote Republican.<br>
 <br>
The GOP takes the votes of race realists and Christian conservatives, while giving the benefits to the investor - employer classes. Real after tax income for eighty percent of the American people has declined since Ronald Reagan moved the country to the right during the 1980s. Real after tax income for the richest one percent of the country has increased dramatically.<br>

Contrary to what Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto, for most people most of the time loyalties of race and ethnicity are stronger than loyalties of class. That is why the electorate in the United States is to the right of electorates in other affluent democracies, where the vast majority is still white or Oriental. </p>

		<p>Keep this in mind. Every White American will experience the brutal consequences of race-replacement.</p>
<p>A self-re-enforcing process very likely has already kicked in thatwill amplfy the process of race-replacement. As White living space shrinks, the cost of affordable family will-has-go up, thereby keeping White fertility at the current replacement level.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is this: millions of White Americans do not think about the consequences of race-replacment&hellip;which with 100 percent certainty-if they could just experience it for month righ now-they would fight against. This is the great paradox we are up against.</p>
<p>For the time being Jared Taylor has hammer home unrelentingly the horrific consequences of race-replacement.  One of the first things he should  ask his audience in a public appearance is this:just what are you willing to give up for racial minority status. Jared Taylor should have done this in his press conference in Charlotte. This is how you start to open up the brains of our fellow Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>Wikipedia has an entry for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965" rel="nofollow"> the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 </a> that has a quotation from Ted Kennedy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same&hellip;. Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset&hellip;. Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia&hellip;. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think&hellip;. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.&#8221; [original citation is to U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C., Feb. 10, 1965. pp. 1-3.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>      As later mentioned in the article, without this Act, demographics wouldn&rsquo;t have changed, and Barack Obama would not be president.</p>

		<p> So what&rsquo;s ahead for a minority/majority or the Third World/Hispanic United States of the future? Of course, all of these trends are not completely due to the demographic changes in the United States promoted by our privileged elites, but a significant amount are. </p>
<p> 1. Declining civil rights: as our society becomes more violent our government becomes more dictatorial and intrusive. Rights are abandoned for public safety; while at the same time, policing is reduced to cut costs and avoid ethnic turmoil. Ethnic/racial infighting for scarce resources leads to more conflict on all levels of society. </p>
<p>2. Increased corruption: Corporations and special interests already control much of our political process; look for corruption to spread to lower civil levels: civil courts and municipal governments  &mdash;  just like Latin America!</p>
<p>3. Rising unemployment: having exported our manufacturing base overseas and imported Third World workers to work for low wages here in America, the outlook for American workers is grim for the foreseeable future. There are now too many people chasing too few jobs. </p>
<p>4. Devalued currency: the government, unable to meet its obligations, will resort to the printing press to keep the economy afloat. There is a 50/50 chance of hyperinflation or another 1930s style Depression. The United States is already too dependent on borrowed money from the Middle East and East Asia just to pay our daily bills. </p>
<p>5. Environmental Decline and Infrastructure disintegration: overpopulation due to immigration puts a strain on our environment, particularly, as more people demand the unsustainable American lifestyle. Due to economic decline we no longer have money even for modest infrastructure repairs. Roads and public buildings develop Third World characteristics.</p>
<p>6. The great disappearing middle class: the manufacturing economy was the on-ramp to the middle class lifestyle for blue collar workers. Now this is gone due to greed and outsourcing. An increasing labor force of non-productive or marginal workers can only mean an overall decline of the economy and a shrinking middle class. Children, for the first time in U.S. History, will have a worst standard of living than their parents. Minorities will become increasing resentful about supporting the retirement of millions of elderly whites. </p>
<p>Sorry, fellow AR posters, I fear I&rsquo;ve gone on too long on this post&hellip;</p>

		<p>Regarding the debate as to who is responsible:</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m just gullible, but I do believe that most of the congressmen who voted for the 1965 immigration act honestly believed that it would be mild. Congressmen usually do not read the bills before voting on them, instead relying on the opinions of lobbyists. </p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that people who hear something more than 11 times begin to believe it no matter how irrational it is.<br>
The problem, in my opinion, begins almost 3 centuries ago when the founding fathers rejected term limits for congressmen on the grounds that this stopped people from voting for who they wanted. This created a situation in which our congressmen become increasingly out of touch with reality as they serve longer, as lobbyists repeat &#8220;The majority of Americans want immigrants&#8221; to them several times a day. I truly believe that most of the congressmen truly believe that diversity is a strength, that white Americans want it, that only a handful of neo-nazis&rsquo;s hate immigrates etc. Opponents of immigration believed that the government would never do something like this and so did not bother hiring our own lobbyists until it was too late, creating a situation in which corporate and liberal-elite lobbyist could convince congressmen that most of the people wanted mass-migration.</p>
<p>More to the point: I think immigration represents a fundamental problem with democracy as a form a government and that measures like &#8220;immigrants can not vote&#8221;, &#8220;no-one can serve in government for more than 2 years&#8221; and &#8220;people born to foreigners are not automatically citizens&#8221; need to be written into all future constitutions to stop politicians from doing this in the future.</p>

<p>Nice plan.  Quite a logistical reach.  I also wonder how well White North Americans would be able to assimilate into White European societies?  Unless you have lived there you would not realize that they think very differently from conservative Americans, even when they are conservatives.  For example, no one questions the social state.  That it should be exclusively for indigenous whites would be the question and realistic resolve, not ending it so &#8220;market forces&#8221; could make life better for all whites.

<p>The numbers are like this:</p>
<p>North East Asians: 1.5 billion</p>
<p>Whites (in the Amren sense):<br>
Europe (including Russia): 740<br>
North America: 238<br>
South America: 200<br>
Australasia: 20</p>
<p>Total whites in world about 1.2  billion</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan African descent about 900 million</p>
<p><br>
So you see Mr Digby black Africans have a good deal more to worry about than whites when it comes to the numbers game.</p>
<p>Whites are the second most numerous race in the world. </p>
<p>So when a black marries a white, surely the white is statistically speaking threatening the black gene pool more than the black is threatening the white gene pool?</p>

		<p>I find it interesting that many on the AMREN site accuse many people being &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; etc. Often these posts are from a perspective of contempt, disgust, and sometimes even downright hatred towards the so-called &#8220;Brainwashed&#8221;. However many of these people while whole heartingly rejecting the racial equalitarianism  argument, have nevertheless been brainwashed themselves by the whole/ libertarian/conservative propaganda of modern day America. Extreme wealth, self based libertarianism are not White society concepts. The whole cheap labor/ free trade axis is part and parcel lying propaganda from the very anti White elite. If we do succeed in having a homogenous White society (which despite all the negativity may very well happen when the economy completely breaks down within the next 10 years) we will have a population which will be like an extended family, which is really what race is. We will then be very socialistic society, which is a natural White trait. Just look at the most socially and economic equality countries. The less non-White a society or non White influence in a society the more SOCIALIST it is. Iceland, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark etc &hellip;.The list tracks almost exactly.So if this thought horrifies you, you are just as &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; as the P.C Whites you so despise. Remember they do not think they are brainwashed either. It is much easier in life to cast stones at others then take a hard look at yourself. How did I reach this epiphany when others find it so difficult. Well I do not think it hurts to have visited 170 countries which gave me the key element needed. PERSPECTIVE!</p>

		<p>I think one of the main problems the US has had is that post-1965 immigration act, it has made it nigh-on impossible for British/European immigration to the US. I have worked for the last 15 years for US software companies selling enterprise solutions to businesses across the UK and EMEA and every penny of that money ($15-20 Million at the last estimate)  has gone to the US as new business revenue. The only revenue the UK has got from me has been from my income taxes, (which by the way at 40-50% of the gross amount are extortionate). </p>
<p>I have personally been more than happy to have worked in this way and been grateful for the good positions and remuneration I&rsquo;ve received from my US bosses. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of offers to work in the US by these companies, but only on a work visa and not on a green card basis. Now if we weigh-up the pros and cons of this situation, it seems that we&rsquo;d have to uproot our very established lives here and move to the US and live there at risk of never being able to get a green card, legitimacy and hopefully eventual citizenship. As much as we both really love the US, really like our American friends and the whole culture of white America in general, the risk of not getting any kind of legitimacy has precluded us from making the move. It&rsquo;s a shame for us because that was one of our ambitions we agreed on when we first met.</p>
<p>It is simply too difficult, with so many hoops to go through for white European, graduates and professionals who earn well to move to the US and help to counter-balance the non-white invasions. All evidence points to the fact that these Mexican invaders made no-such considerations about how they could contribute and add to the US when they decided to hop the border. I think they just weighed-up what they could sponge from the American taxpayer and at the same time more than likely believing they were a part of the Mexican La Raza movement to take back the US from the white (at the time) majority.</p>
<p>I called the US embassy in London and asked if I could apply for a green card/citizenship explained my credentials and the fact I&rsquo;d be bringing capital to the US and they actively discouraged me from pursuing an application. -Talk about not being wanted. It is galling when all the illegal immigrants seem to get carte blanche on everything and almost never get deported (even after committing crimes) yet my wife and I, who would love to move to the US are refused with a no-thank you and move-on, despite having post-grad degrees, capital and a strong affinity towards the US and the American people.</p>
<p>The other astonishing fact is that I have tried to apply for the US green card lottery and I was not allowed to because I was British. If I was Irish, this would not been a problem. (The Irish get 50k-100k cards a year distributed on a lottery basis). I know the war of independence was justly fought and won but that was a long time ago and had nothing to do with me (honest guvnor). If the logic-inverted liberal mores and lies were never allowed to take root and the US encouraged European, hard-working, qualified and trained people to emigrate and at the same time secured it&rsquo;s own borders, it would never have got to this pitiful stage where white Americans will soon be a minority in their own country.</p>
<p>-Seems like that&rsquo;s three very simple &#8220;ifs&#8221; too many.<br>

As usual, people here make ridiculous assertions completely unsupported by the facts.</i></p>
<p>You see, most of our fears come from the unsustainability of having sub-replacement levels of birth rate of Whites.</p>
<p>This concept entails an interesting technique called &#8220;planning for the future&#8221;, and I understand a lot of leftists have trouble with that. It&rsquo;s OK, we&rsquo;re here to help.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s population is about 720 million. A fair percentage of this would be non-Whites from Africa, the ME, the rest of Asia, etc. </p>
<p>Canada has 35 million. Canada is filled with non-Whites.</p>
<p>The USA has over 300 million, too bad only about 74% of that is White.</p>
<p>The White population of Central and South America can hardly be guessed due to mixing, but the number without non-White blood is known to be in the vast minority.</p>
<p>Australia has about 20 million. Australia suffers from Canada syndrome.</p>
<p>New Zealand has less than 5 million. This is not 100% White but we&rsquo;ll assume it is.</p>
<p>This would actually lower the number of people we&rsquo;d see as White to less than 1 billion.</p>
<p><i><br>
There are significantly more whites than there are black Africans in the world.</i></p>
<p>Africa has 1 billion people right now. North Africa has a ton of non-Blacks, but the majority of Africa is Black. By 2100, Nigeria <b>alone</b> will have more blacks than all of Europe has for Whites. Oops! It&rsquo;s believed Africa&rsquo;s population will surpass 2 billion by that time.</p>
<p><i>Whites are more or less in the same ball park when it comes to absolute numbers as East Asians.</i></p>
<p>Ah, this is incorrect. There are 1.3 billion people in China alone. This is projected to be 1.6 by 2025. There won&rsquo;t be 1 billion Whites everywhere on earth in 2025, much less in one country.</p>
<p><i><br>
Of course if you want to throw in all Caucasoid types (Arabs, South Asians, Persians, North Africans, Turks) etc, then Caucasians would quite possibly outnumber Mongoloids (I&rsquo;m not sure  &mdash; have to do the arithmetic).</i></p>
<p>This is like saying any count of the tiger population of China must also include domestic cats, because both are feliformes.</p>
<p>Oh, and Arabs aren&rsquo;t &#8220;Caucasoid&#8221;. They are a Semitic people.</p>
<p><br>
<i><br>
Well perhaps if your ancestors stayed at home in Europe you would not have ended up with this &lsquo;problem&rsquo;.</i></p>
<p>The sad state of European affairs shows this argument of yours to be as poorly-thought out as the rest of your rant.</p>
<p>To sum up, White populations all over the earth are declining, with the possible exception of a few Eastern European countries. Everyone else&rsquo;s population is rising. We have the right to be concerned about preserving our kind and not going extinct.</p>

		<p>John Engleman at 45 makes an excellent point. Charles Butt, CEO of the HEB grocery store chain here in Texas, and Bob Perry of Perry Homes, also a Texas Company, both have come out against Gov Rick Perry&rsquo;s proposed Bill to ban sanctuary cities here in the Lone Star State. Bob Perry  &mdash;  no kin to the Governor  &mdash;  has made over $7million in campaign contributions over the last few years. HEB earns millions every year catering to Hispanics and  Perry Homes benefits from the cheap labor. The point is that the wealthiest white Americans are insulated from the immediate effects of these social and demographic changes and the economic havoc they reap on natural born Americans. As long as their bottom line looks good they don&rsquo;t care what happens to the country. Or what happens to the white middle class that helped build their companies and their wealth.</p>

<p>These numbers are seriously distorted. The Russian federation have over 100 ethnicities, many of them non white. There are perhaps 130-140 million ethnic Russians, the rest various mestizos and non whites. There are many non whites in Europe too. There arent 238 million whites in USA, there are only about 150 million &#8220;real&#8221; whites. There is no way there are 200 million whites in south america. 200 million Caucasians and high yellow mestizos of which only a minority is white. The perpetual dysfunction of Latin America isnt random.</p>
<p>Global white numbers are about 650-700 million with most of them being Mediterranean or Atlantic whites, who are second to Nordic Germanic when it comes to technology, science and organization. They are better at making popular culture though. As long as there is an intact core of Nordic whites the white race can stage a comeback by reshaping the world and obsoleting all other civilizations. As for white children, in the grim future that awaits us, most whites will die childless or without grandchildren as our living space contracts. The chief problem when it comes to secure white survival is the lack of collective cohesion among whites - white individualism isnt a positive survival trait in this situation since it can be turned against the white collective. </p>

<p>Talk about defeatist attitudes.  It&rsquo;s almost sickening.  No, it IS sickening.</p>
<p>I plan to have multiple children, and have no intention of simply rolling over and letting non-whites ruin this once great nation.  This from a twenty-two year old.  You want to help preserve our race?  You can start by growing a spine.  This might come off as harsh, but this is really the last place I wanted to read a bunch of &#8220;oh no we&rsquo;re doomed, might as well roll over and die and tell our grand children what bad mistakes we made&#8221; comments.</p>
<p>You bemoan the low white fertility rate, but how many children have you had?  If you&rsquo;re young, how many do you plan on having?  I hear a lot of excuses about how expensive it is, and sorry - but I simply don&rsquo;t buy it(someone else mentioned the Amish&hellip;).  It might be expensive, but it&rsquo;s also completely necessary.  That new shiny car you just bought was not.</p>
<p>I will likely never be rich in the monetary sense, but unlike most whites I have zero problem with that as long as I&rsquo;m rich in what really matters most.  Family.</p>

		<p>There will continue to be a massive, increased flood of Mexicans pushing their way into the US to escape the escalating violence and mayhem of Mexico&rsquo;s Civil Wars.</p>
<p>The US State Department has issued a travel warning for Mexico:</p>
<p>Travel Warnings are issued to describe long-term, protracted conditions that make a country dangerous or unstable.</p>
<p>Here are parts of the warning from the US State Department:</p>
<p>According to Government of Mexico figures, 34,612 people have been killed in violence in Mexico since December 2006. More than 15,000 narcotics-related homicides occurred in 2010, an increase of almost two-thirds compared to 2009.</p>
<p>Criminal organizations have erected their own unauthorized checkpoints, and killed or abducted motorists who have failed to stop at them.</p>
<p>Since 2006, large firefights have taken place in towns and cities in many parts of Mexico, often in broad daylight on streets and other public venues.</p>
<p>In recent months, criminal organizations have used stolen trucks to block major highways and thus prevent the military from responding to criminal activity</p>
<p>And Mexico&rsquo;s Civil War is escalating as the government cracks down on the cartels  &mdash;  cartels armed with military weaponry such as rocket launchers, automatic weapons, grenades, grenade launchers and machine guns (NOT purchased in US gun stores or at gun shows as the Mexican government tells us)</p>
<p>Mexico faces years of instability, civil war and most importantly for the US, overwhelming waves of poor, uneducated refugees pouring across the US border, demanding services and changing US demographics.</p>

      The point is that the black African population is sky-rocketing exponentially (it will surely double in 3 or 4 decades), and Whites worldwide are in steep decline.<br>
 Blacks will equal and surpass Whites in numbers in 1 or 2 decades, the trend is that blacks ALONE will vastly outnumber Whites by mid century - and this is not counting orientals, subcon Indians, middle easters and north Africans, south Americans and other dark races.</p>

<p>Whites are not the second most numerous racial group, if their<br>
total population is 1.2 billions. For example, India population<br>
is about 1.2 billion and that is just one country in South<br>
Asia. If Pakistan(160 millions)  and Bangladesh(170 millions) are included then thats an additional 330 million people<br>
exceeding the 1.5 billion you listed for East Asians.<br>
This would make South Asian the most numerous racial group.</p>
<p>You are correct that there are more Whites than Blacks if the<br>
White population is 1.2 billons as you have stated since<br>
there are about 1 billion people in Africa (some are not black)<br>
and there are about 180 million Blacks outside of Africa(African<br>
Diaspora, Wikipedia). So that would make South Asian<br>
the most numerous followed by East Asian . Whites thus would<br>
be the third most numerous racial group and Blacks the fourth .</p>

<p>We will be minorities in the US very soon; that&rsquo;s almost a given. But, it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that a people who have been, and still are to a great degree, the most dominant, and RESOURCEFUL, force on the planet can be near extinction in a matter of decades, or even a few centuries. Some people give into hysteria whenever negative numbers like this are made public. </p>
<p>It just might be that a smaller population is the only thing that will finally cause whites to finally pull together once and for all. A hard, tight core that develops a thick shell. </p>

<p>I deliberately left out the subcontinent - because they are a mishmash of races, with everything from dark skinned dravidians all the way to Northerners, some of whom are virtually indistinguisable from whites. To call the Indian subcontinent a single racial group is thus a bit of a stretch. In fact given the genetic distance between a fair skinned Afghani and a dark skinned Sri-Lankan, if we were to include these two into the same racial grouping, then logically we should do the same for some North Africans and whites.</p>
<p>So again it stands (in terms of more or less &#8216;pure&rsquo; races):</p>
<p>North East Asians: 1.4 billion<br>
Whites (in the amren sense): 1.2 billion<br>
Sub-saharan Africans: 900 million.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;These numbers are seriously distorted. The Russian federation have over 100 ethnicities, many of them non white.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If you check my numbers in some depth, you will note that the numbers I provide under post #59 have already discounted the non-white populations of the areas listed.</p>
<p><i>and this is not counting orientals, subcon Indians, middle easters and north Africans, south Americans and other dark races.</i></p>
<p>Most developed North East Asian countries have very low birthrates. This trend is also seen in China. As China develops even more, the North East Asian population will peak at some point in the next two decades and then level off or even go down.</p>
<p>And yes. Whites may feel outnumbered. But their numbers are pretty healthy compared to the numbers of say Indonesians/Malaysians (about 200 million), Arabs (300 million),Polynesians (less than 1 million - and many of them mixed with white), Native Americans (again many mixed), Eskimos, Mauritians, Madagascans, and Tibetans (2 million).</p>
<p>The most endangered peoples in the world are mostly indigenous peoples, like the Buryat, the Kalmyks, etc.</p>
<p>To say whites, at 1.2 billion, are &#8216;endangered&rsquo; is just absurd.</p>

<p>Mexicans hate whites almost as much as blacks do.</p>
<p>Do not believe mexicans will allow whites to live in Nuevo Mexico, i.e., the former southwestern quadrant of the former United States of America.  Many of their activists claim this is their land stolen from them by illegal white colonists and call for whites &#8220;get off.&#8221;</p>
<p>When their numbers allow it, soon, they will begin the confiscation of white-owned property, claiming it was theirs in the first place, and they will use violence to drive us off.

<p>Very excellant observations.  Here is a thought for opening up conversations  &mdash;  when you see a white child in a public setting strike up a conversation with a person near by, words to the effect of &#8220;What a beautiful child but how sad that that child will grow up to be a minority in our country&#8221;.  Then you can explain how there are now more nonwhite babies being born than white ones.  Or you see a young child with its mom or dad and you say  &mdash;  &#8220;What a beautiful child.  It is so good to see people having children as white babies are now the minority.&#8221;  That should make them think.  These approaches are especially good for women, as women will often start up conversations with mothers complementing their children.  You could even deliberately choose to go to parks where families with children congregate.</p>
<p>I also believe that blue-collar people will be more open to the message than the stuck-up snob elites.  They are more real and less pretentious than the educated, not that there aren&rsquo;t racially aware people among the educated classes but I think you would be less likely to get some pc icy put down.</p>

<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t overall white numbers but their isolation, fragmentation and sophistication as a culture.  Russia is not the U.S.  The UK is close but has too few to match us and will fall ever further behind as the race to socialism runs neck and neck with that of Sharia.  EU-rope as a whole is fighting itself and the Euro-Arab Dialogue with socialization rapidly catching up with the UK on the numbers slide.</p>
<p>@70 Mike H.,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the numbers game.  It&rsquo;s the resources one.  We _cannot_ sustain a population of 300 million in the U.S. at U.S. equivalent economic (status of living/SES) levels because the natural resources which made our parents rich are rapidly depleting as we foolishly attempt to raise the world&rsquo;s population to our level, the better to exploit them.  Which should tell you exactly how bad the rest of the planet is with nations like Pakistan crushing 170 million people into an area roughly the size of Alaska.  If whites naturally, with the aid of high technology, relaxed back to about 60-100 million, our continent would remain beautiful, wide-open and wondrous for our children to inherit.  We could -all- live like kings rather than sardines.  But that would require us to OWN our future, and right now we do not.</p>

<p>Mexico is at the tipping point.  If we sealed our borders she might well crash as a society.  So?  We would not.  OTOH, if you want to WIN a war, backs to the wall is one way to take things seriously rather than pressure-relief valve outgassing criminal and poverty classes to the U.S..

<p>@77 Stiv,</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to be extinct to lose all cultural force as a drive to excellence.  In fact, that is how MOST have-been societies have met their doom, &#8216;allowing the enemy across the Danube&rsquo;.  The problem with overpop is that it removes opportunity by filling it with social connivance.  And the population with the most people will be the population with the most control over how society shapes itself to accommodate improvements in technology and culture and people.  NASA is now a PR agency for Islam because nobody has the stones to say that Mars might be more important (Micro-fusial reactors are a prerequisite for ion drives to get there before low-g damage to our bodies becomes an issue.  FUSION is essential for a green economy follow to a petro one.  Space thus leads Earth.).  It should be our right to decide, for ourselves, what way our economy and national structure shifts.  It can&rsquo;t be so if we are not a 90% white enclave because 90% white is the kind of society that gives men dreams.</p>
<p>We can compress and reachieve that level, in a central agro belt layer of states which we control, absolutely, as the primary food source of the nation.  Yielding up 1/3 to 1/2 of our nation to the brown flood seems unacceptable.  But since we won&rsquo;t deport unwanted cultures to &#8216;the East&rsquo;, we will only be swamped if we continue to allow things to proceed apace.  No one else will take our castoffs as they insist we take theirs so we have no choice but to separate in-place by drawing away.  If we don&rsquo;t, whites will lose the cultural openness by which we survive as a people and -excel- as a cultural force.</p>

		<p><i>A &lsquo;fair Afghan&rsquo; (as you term it), is genetically a far closer relation to a Sri Lankan than a White European</i></p>
<p>You are completely wrong. The most authoritative chart of racial relatedness is that of Prof. Cavalli-Sforza. As Glayde Whitney says his work almost &#8220;perfectly parallel the traditional racial groupings based on physical anthropology&#8221; and that it is so &#8216;important&rsquo; that it has been reproduced in two previous issues of AR. </p>
<p>Here is the chart.<br>
<a href="/ar/2000/08/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2000/08/index.html</a></p>
<p>As you can see a SW Asian (Afghans etc) are much more closely related to the English than they are to SE Indians (such as Sri Lankans etc).</p>
<p><i>Those are ethnic groups, not races.<br>
You could say the same of Albanians, Welch, or Finns; but they are not races either.You cannot compare the Buryat with the whole Caucasian race.You are drawing false analogies and obscuring the issues, as usual (typical of your style of obfuscation).</i></p>
<p>I am not obfuscating. Again refer to the chart linked above.<br>
It is well know that Tibetans are quite physically unique, they look different and have stronger lungs than the average Chinese. On Cavalli-Sforza&rsquo;s chart you can see that the genetic difference between Tibetans on the one hand, and North East Asians like Koreans and Japanese on the other hand, is actually greater than the genetic distance between the English and SW Asians (such as Iranians and Afghans).</p>
<p>The Tibetans are certainly a very distinct race.</p>
<p>Buryat&rsquo;s for one are a Mongol people. The Mongols are also a very unique and distinct people. They are less related to Japanese and Koreans than English are to Berbers and North Africans.</p>
<p>So if one says it is OK if the Buryats die out, because there are hundreds of millions of Japanese and Chinese anyway, then to be logically consistent you might as well say the same of the English   &mdash;  who cares if  the English die out because there are plenty of racially equivalent Aghans and Iranians in the world. </p>
<p>Note that in the Republic of Buryatia, Buryats (28% of population) are heavily outnumbered in their native land by white Russians (68%). </p>
<p>Again there are many many endangered peoples in the world (another is the Polynesians   &mdash;  the Maori in New Zealand are outnumbered by about 6 to 1 by Europeans). </p>
<p>Whites are not one of these. </p>
<p>In fact, just on numbers alone, if Whites are endangered, then Sub-Saharan Africans are even more so.</p>

		<p>#88 They would have tons of children even if they didnt get welfare. They would just let them run wild on the streets foraging for food. Its very difficult for the vast majority of white people to understand that non whites can and do function very different mentally than themselves on a fundamental plane. </p>

		<p>Wayne certainly has proven his point that Whites are not<br>
an endangered race given that there are almost 1.3 billion(note<br>
he didn&rsquo;t include New Zealand and other places where Whites<br>
live) and much less Blacks. Bear in mind that the per capita<br>
wealth of Whites are much larger than Blacks and other racial<br>
groups ensuring that Whites are less endangered than others.<br>
Whites are actually the wealthiest racial group by a wide<br>
margin  inspite of the constant discussion about Asia&rsquo;s wealth<br>
and China&rsquo;s rise.<br>

      As usual with your deliberate misleading and misinformation, you miss the entire point of the article.The point is that Americans of European ancestry are losing majority staus in their own nation, and before tthis century&rsquo;s end will be reduced to an insignificant minority - the stae of California is the precursor of what is happening.<br>
 As you state European peoples might total 1.2 billion worldwide.But two dark nations alone, India and China both surpass that number.1.2 billion is only 20% of the global total, and more importantly Whites are not reproducing and are in a sate of actual decline, whilst dark races increase exponentially, the implication being Whites in the span of a human life will be reduced to a small percentage of the World&rsquo;s total, this, surely is a justification of the word &#8216;endangered&rsquo; - the fact that a rapid decline is occurring and dark races are taking up the living space.As a matter of fact, continuing decline inevitably ends in extinction.<br>
   As for subcontinental genetics, I stick to my point.Subcons, when measured by their peculiar genetic components, cluster together and are readily distinguishable from the European cluster.Furthrmore genetic haplotypes found in the subcontinent are not found in Europe.Geneticists are certain that all subcons are realted to the ancient pre-Aryan (or ASI - ancestral southern Indian)genetic substrate, the purest for today to be found amongst the Andaman Islands.Australian aborigines have been claimed to be related to the ancient Indian substrate.</p>

They spent their youth triping on acid, fornicating like crazy, attacking Western Culture, and now they have their mouths latched on the governement teat only death will end their parasitism.  The 13th generation is our hope.  Even though I am technically a Boomer, we will all be better off when they depart from this earth.  They have no moral authority.  Full stop.</p>
<p>My 13er wife and i have five home-schooled children,  They are learning to hate tyranny, love God, and defend themselves.  All things the sorry Boomers were too busy divorcing, abandoning and aborting to teach.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;But two dark nations alone, India and China both surpass that number.1.2 billion is only 20% of the global&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>This is a ridiculous statement to make. Genetically most Indians are closer to whites than they are to Chinese. Even the cultural links are strong, with many Indian languages being Indo-European.</p>
<p>The fact is there are more whites in the world than subcontinentals.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;and more importantly Whites are not reproducing and are in a sate of actual decline&hellip;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The white population is actually holding steady. Only in Russia is it sort of in decline. The North East Asians are set to peak soon, and as China&rsquo;s development continues, she will likely follow Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore in having very low birth rates. </p>
<p>As for subcontinentals can you provide a link to some research that refutes the Cavalli-Sforza chart showing Afghans, North Indians are more closely related to whites than they are to Sri Lankans and other SE Indians? The chart linked to is from an Amren article.</p>
<p><i>Tibetans and Mongols may be distinctive (within their race), but they do NOT constitute one of the five fundamental races of mankind.</i></p>
<p>That is hardly the point. Tibetans are more genetically distinct from Chinese, Japanese, Koreans etc than whites are from Iranians and Afghans. </p>
<p>The point is are they genetically <i>replaceable</i> by other peoples if they died out? While Tibetans I am sure are no more happy about being replaced by Chinese, who are in every sense as racially (and culturally alien) from them, than most whites of an Amren persuasion would be happy about race replacement by Iranians.</p>
<p>The thing is Tibetans are obviously in far more danger of extinction than whites. Whites are close to East Asians in absolute numbers. In fact there are as many whites in the world as there are Chinese. </p>
<p>I have never heard anyone say the Chinese are endangered. Well then, neither are whites.</p>
<p>Another thing, if we talk about the major races, my guess is Caucasoids would significantly outnumber Mongoloids.</p>
