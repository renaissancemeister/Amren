<h1><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/147881/Americans-Divided-Taxing-Rich-Redistribute-Wealth.aspx">Americans Divided on Taxing the Rich to Redistribute Wealth</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lydia Saad, Gallup, June 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Americans break into two roughly evenly matched camps on the question of whether the government should enact heavy taxes on the rich to redistribute wealth in the U.S. Forty-seven percent believe the government should redistribute wealth in this way, while 49% disagree, similar to views Gallup found four years ago.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats have sharply different reactions to the government&rsquo;s taking such an active role in equalizing economic outcomes. Seven in 10 Democrats believe the government should levy taxes on the rich to redistribute wealth, while an equal proportion of Republicans believe it should not. The slight majority of independents oppose this policy.</p>
<p>The question also provokes different reactions from men compared with women, whites vs. nonwhites, and upper-income vs. lower-income Americans. Consistent with their more Democratic political orientation, women, nonwhites, and lower-income adults are all more supportive than their counterparts of government redistribution of wealth via taxes.</p>
<p>These findings are from Gallup&rsquo;s 2011 Economics and Finance poll, conducted April 7-11.</p>
<p>According to the same poll, the majority of Americans  &mdash;  57%  &mdash;  believe money and wealth in the country should be more evenly distributed among a larger population. About a third  &mdash;  35%  &mdash;  think the current distribution is fair. Americans were slightly less likely to believe the distribution of wealth was fair from 2003 to early 2008; however, the current level is about the average for the full trend since 1984.</p>
<p>A different question probes Americans&rsquo; perceptions about the number of rich people in the country, and finds the plurality  &mdash;  42%  &mdash;  believing the current level is about right. However, consistent with every other time Gallup has asked this question since 1990, more believe there are too many rich people than too few, 31% vs. 21%.</p>
<p>Again, perceptions about wealth are highly partisan, as the majority of Republicans say the number of rich people is about right (52%) and more say there are too few rather than too many (27% vs. 16%). Conversely, one-third (35%) of Democrats say the number of rich people is about right and, by 43% to 15%, more Democrats say there are too many rich people than too few.</p>
<p><b>Bottom Line</b></p>
<p>While a solid majority of Americans, 57%, believe money and wealth in the U.S. should be more evenly distributed among the people, fewer than half favor using the federal tax code to do so. {snip}<br>

		<p>Wealth is redistributed by taxes, Affirmative Action hiring policies, hospital bills (via higher insurance premiums), utility bills, tuition payments, and who knows what else. The 3rd world presence makes life more expensive, more dangerous, and less fun for native-born Americans.</p>
<p>Wages in Central America are $3/day. Wages in Africa are $1/day. In these places, if you don&rsquo;t work, you don&rsquo;t eat, and there is no equivalent to our health care system. So the current American system is pretty good for our new arrivals. One would think there would be some gratitude.<br>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t need to read this article to know the result.  It&rsquo;s been obvious for years.</p>
<p>As whites age and become less of the population, the politicians will be attempting to garner the increasing minority vote with a cloaked sales pitch.  Really it will be racially charged.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rich&#8221; will mean &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supporting education&#8221; will mean taking older whites&rsquo; money and giving it to minority families.</p>
<p>The inheritance tax will be revived in force because it will be mostly white money that will be confiscated.</p>
<p>I can only dread what the healthcare situation will be like - those &#8220;seniors&#8221; don&rsquo;t need as much care as they have been getting.<br>

The left, which includes the majority of blacks, doesn&rsquo;t understand how wealth is generated. They believe there is a finite amount of money which one group (rich whites) selfishly horde for themselves.  </p>
<p>Redistribution of wealth, if it was even possible, would be a one shot deal as most people would simply continue on as they lived and all previous inequalities would re-emerge.<br>

		<p>&#8220;the rich mean White&#8221;. Be real you are listening to Plutocratic liars and traitors. Most Whites pay 15% payroll, then income. The rich pay almost no payroll. So the taxes are not regressive. Most rich people have been doing oh so much better, while our race sinks. I truly am ready to give up on Whites who think CONservatives are ProWhite. If you believe that how come things actually get worse under the Conservatives. Reagan-amnesty, Bush everything. When it comes to the Plutocrats of this country I will side with anyoneone against our greatest enemies.  Remember despite all our whining, Blacks and Hispanics still have very little power as of yet.</p>

		<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what the &#8220;majority&#8221; of Americans believe.  The rich - and overwhelmingly white - are leaving this country in droves.  Of course, most Americans aren&rsquo;t even aware of this because it gets NO PUBLICITY!  And, we know they don&rsquo;t mean the super-rich like the Gateses, Buffetts, and Blankfeins (I, personally, don&rsquo;t consider these guys to be American, at least in not my sense of the word).  Take Warren Buffett who always talks that the rich need to be taxed and that his secretary pays more in taxes than he does.  Hmmm, Warren, you want to expand on that one?  The same guy who &#8220;hides&#8221; his money offshore and/or in low-tax or tax-free instruments (the same guy who was telling people a month or two ago that a certain stock was a good buy while Bershire Hathaway was unloading their shares via the back door).  You have the globalists who want to redistribute wealth (not theirs though) and the sensible white population knowing it is another nail in their collective coffin!<br>

<p>A lot of this debate hinges on precisely what is meant by &#8220;rich&#8221; (which is left undefined).   </p>
<p>Do they mean the really, really rich, the immensely wealthy; or do they mean those who are quite a bit better-off as compared to the average, but far from millionaires or billionaires? </p>
<p>Without defining terms, the debate is meaningless.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I woe for the changes ahead. I see it from the inside now that there is so much multiculturalism, political correctness, feminism, and &#8220;social justice&#8221; in health care at the moment &hellip;and its a trend that is only getting worse. At anything that remotely touches public (and way too many private systems) it is already in place. Right now there are enough payers that its just making it painful for most, and out of reach of maybe 15-20% of people that need it.  If the trend continues, the costs will put health care out of reach of 30-40% within 10 years or so.  If it then goes public, we&rsquo;ll get more of the same.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a winning strategy here when its career ending to speak to the tragedy happening within the system. The only people &#8220;free&#8221; to speak, are those ready to retire. </p>

		<p>My problem with these questions is the word &#8220;redistribute&#8221;. I do not feel that the government should take money from the rich and give it to the poor. The US should not be run by Robin Hood. In my opinion upper income people should pay a higher tax rate than a low income earner. Someone making for example $20,000 will spend a large percentage of income on necessities like rent, utilities, food, etc. Leaving little money left over. An earner of $200,000 will have more disposable income that can be taxed. If someone can afford to drive a Bentley or Mercedes Benz they can pay more in taxes. Most but not all programs to benefit the poor are a waste of tax dollars. Highway construction, park improvement and hospital construction are some examples that benefit everyone. Government should spend money to increase the quality of life for all citizens, not redistribute to benefit a certain segment of citizens.</p>

		<p>Beware of unintended consequences. Redistribution of wealth and increasing taxes on the rich are not the same. In fact, I believe that increasing taxes for the rich may actually redistribute wealth from the middle class to the wealthy. </p>
<p>Fedgov gets ~90% of its income tax from the rich. If taxes on the rich are increased, fedgov will want to make them even richer to get more tax. It can do this by importing even more cheap labour. This will increase the income of the wealthy which increases tax revenue. This increase will be much greater than the reduction in tax revenue from middle income tax payers, and those who &#8220;work off the books&#8221;. </p>
<p>Also note that middle income unemployment will have less effect on tax revenues than it does at current tax rates. This means even less governmental interest in massive unemployment, particularly if the unemployed are white men.</p>

		<p>The demand for redistribution of wealth is, no doubt, the outcome of anti-White bias that misrepresents White achievement as, somehow, unfair and abusive to non-Whites. </p>
<p>What non-Whites fail to realize is that, were it not for White achievement, their lives would revert to living in sub-Saharan grass huts, donning lip plates and neck rings and bathing babies in cow urine. </p>
<p>An exaggeration? Not really. </p>
<p>Consider the outcome of American communities that have been abandoned by Whites and left to blacks. Detroit comes to mind. What we find are deplorable living conditions and lots of bling. </p>
<p>Suffice it to say that non-Whites, Africans-in-America in particular, already benefit from redistribution of wealth by default. Electricity, running water, motor vehicles top the list of hundreds of thousands of conveniences Western culture has bestowed upon civilization. All people of all races benefit.</p>
<p>The irony not only lies in blacks failing to appreciate the blessing of living in a Western culture. It also seen in blacks using White-inspired technology for racist assaults against members of the race who devised that technology!</p>
<p>Black use cell-phone texting technology to organize flash mob attacks. White people and White businesses are the targets. They use firearms to injure and frequently kill White people and hordes of blacks converged on Myrtle Beach for a weekend of mayhem and crime. I know of no blacks who played a creative role in the development of cell phones, fire arms or motorcycles.</p>

<p>Excellent point, Mr. Anonymous.    Actually, it&rsquo;s a little more devious that this comment alone suggests.  For those of us who&rsquo;re old enough to remember the 1960s, and who&rsquo;ve done a little research into the period between the enactment of the first federal income tax we are aware of the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;According to the History of the Income Tax in our almanac, the federal income tax was first enacted in 1862 to support the Union&rsquo;s Civil War effort. It was eliminated in 1872, revived in 1894, then declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court the following year. In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution made the income tax a permanent fixture in the U.S. tax system.&#8221;</p>
<p>1913 was also the year that the criminal international bankers managed to get their nation plundering crime syndicate, otherwise known as the Federal Reserve, established.  No coincidence.    These two events, i.e., the 16th Amendment and the Federal Reserve are intimately connected.  </p>
<p>In essence, in the years following the enactment of the 16th Amendment - the anti-white, anti-Western aliens behind both of these abominations sought to use the US tax code in a confiscatory fashion to strip the wealth from the old WASP ruling elite class.  This was done in order to help reduce their influence and power and to set the stage for a hostile, alien takeover of our nation by the current crop of anti-white, anti-Western, Cultural Marxist poisoned new class of ruling elites.</p>
<p>So, as we here at AR know all too well - this new ruling class is our mortal enemy and they seek the complete destruction of both the White descendants of the Founding Stock of this nation, and the death of Western Civilization - which is a product of the genius of our people.</p>
<p>Oh, and now that the old WASP elites have been dethroned and had a substantial portion of their wealth fleeced from them via the confiscatory tax rates - which helped prevent them from passing on their wealth to their progeny, and thereby be able to continue to hold power and influence - the tax rates on the super rich were lowered and various new loop-holes were cleverly inserted into the tax code which today allows the new, alien, anti-white, anti-Western ruling elites to escape the fate that they bestowed upon the old WASPs.   </p>
<p>However, what makes this situation so nauseating and pathetic, is that the old WASPs didn&rsquo;t even put up a very good fight to save themselves or to save their own nation, and today, the<br>
remaining WASP elite families have pretty much decided to throw in their lot with the new anti-white elitists who dethroned them and help them destroy our race and Western civilization.    Therefore, unless and until the remaining wealthy WASPs join in with those of us in the AR community and white nationalist community and resume fighting these enemies and dethrone THEM, and take OUR nation back - I have zero sympathy for them.   As far as I am concerned, they deserve to be taxed at a 95% rate until they get the message:</p>
<p>&#8220;You do NOT betray your race and your nation.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Lemme see here  &mdash;  if I work hard, plow the profits back into my business for years and years, produce jobs and products for my community and invest wisely, I should have it taken away from me and given to somebody who never worked a day in their lazy life just because I&rsquo;m &#8220;wealthy&#8221; (by somebody&rsquo;s standards)? In that case, why the hell bother to be a productive member of society? </p>

		<p>One must pose the question, just what is taxation?  Is it the privilege of living in this nation and supporting this wonderful government?  If the answer is yes, then in essence the European American/European is taxed for the building of his or her own gallows and, the wood, for his or her own funeral pyre (i.e., elimination, removal, and eradication).     </p>

		<p>The traditional arguments for appeasing the rich have to do with trickle down effects from innovation and investment.  We have not had any really major discovery that &#8216;improves society as a whole&rsquo; in at least 50 years, IMO.</p>
<p>No fusion = free power.<br>
No field drive = zero mass-reaction (fueled) propulsion.<br>
No genetics = smarter/kinder/more responsible population.<br>
No robotics = free labor in drudge areas that do not require <br>
              wage slavery from ethnic immigrants.</p>
<p>IMO, this more than anything PROVES that capitalism as entrepreneurialist endeavor is _dead_.  And has been for a very long time.</p>
<p>OTOH, the system infrastructure which capitalism created is still in place and still vulnerable to sabotage or abandonment.</p>
<p>If you give the rich a reason to transfer money outside the nation (punitive taxation of a &#8216;minority&rsquo;) they will do so.</p>
<p>And then, when the worst moment of implementation of these draconian measures comes, they will hop on their jets and -leave-.</p>
<p>And all the laws on the books about transfer of moneys outside the nation will not be able to keep up with the high priced, loophole seeking, financial accountants who help them with their 135 IQ, 4 million dollar or more, escape plans.</p>
<p>Myself, it&rsquo;s obvious that the ties between success, IQ and hence genetics are so high that you are either competitive in the top 20th or better percentile of intellect.  Or you are an also ran, struggling to run in place on a treadmill which will only let you off when you are too old to work efficiently and without any Social Security safety net to survive the 10-15 years of retirement the mortality tables say you have left.</p>
<p>If someone says: &#8220;No, not for me.  I am not a cog to make a system designed to benefit the rich, go around a little faster.&#8221; there is nothing you can do to make them a better worker because _they know_ they will never have the levels of material wealth to be happy, doing what they do, for others.</p>
<p>The question for me then comes down to whether I want my government to:</p>
<p>1.  Sustain a &#8216;service economy&rsquo; solely to provide employment for the lowest class of people who are not happy doing what they do, even if it drags down the amount of investment and profit from other, high tech, manufacturing and sciences, to support them.</p>
<p>2.  Reward them for disestablishing themselves from the economy, essentially self-refunding out of the social and genetic picture so that society and the economy itself can change?</p>
<p>I personally believe that, provided you made a state-sponsored housing system (project ++) sufficiently enticing, low end working class people could be easily induced to lower their personal expenditures to say 5,000 dollars, each.</p>
<p>With economies of scale savings being made on the basis of large service contracts let to major companies (McDonalds etc.) to supply basics of subsistence living (food, maid service, janitorial maintenance, utilities) and the people receiving a fixed personal expenditure income as discretionary funds, once per month, total expenditure, per person, could be as little as 500 + 400 or 900 dollars total.</p>
<p>Think of it as being similar to farm combines who purchase everything from utilities to gasoline in bulk, except that these urban folks have no real marketable skills _and never will_.  </p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Comparatively, if an individual tries to go it alone, their total expenditures: 200 a month in trash pickup and utilities, 400 a month in food, 600-700 a month in rent, and 500 a month in gasoline and insurance for a vehicle, rapidly adds up to major investment in a lifestyle which will increasingly (post-peak oil) be impossible to maintain at a level similar to what they want to emulate (in the wealth classes) anyway.</p>
<p>No personal vehicles may well be a cultural shift we and certainly our children, ALL have to accept in the future.</p>
<p>Even without personal cars, if you are supplying someone 15-17,000 dollars a year in direct salary and another 10,000 more in &#8216;living wage&rsquo; bonus offsets to what their skill sets actually can net them in our economy, you have a real, per-person cost of 27,000 dollars.</p>
<p>For ditch diggers.</p>
<p>If you supply them -everything- they could wish as government guaranteed housing, food and electricity (@ 500 dollars per person, per month for unified services) -and- 5,000 dollars a year in discretionaries, you end up spending about 11,000 dollars a year, total.</p>
<p>I know which level of guaranteed lifestyle I would prefer to be &#8216;taxed&rsquo; for.  I also know that I would require those who contractually entered such a no-job lifestyle as pure consumers to be sterilized after their first kid.  So that every 60 years or so, our population of the indolent and sub-90 intelligent would drop by half.</p>
<p>So why would a high work ethic, socially responsible, person want to agree to such largesse?</p>
<p>Four Reasons:</p>
<p>1.  If you have a 135 IQ and your mate has a 125 IQ and your population mean is 100 IQ, it is likely that your children will have an IQ somewhere in between.  Intelligence does _not_ conserve between generations.  And so you never know when you or yours might need the safety net.</p>
<p>2.  If you don&rsquo;t like working with certain ethnics and are tired of seeing massive inefficiencies and affirmative action spending on incompetency as &#8216;attitude&rsquo;, then this could be a way to return some sanity to the higher end workplaces.</p>
<p>3.  Numbers win.  We have invited the barbarians across the Danube and so we literally _cannot afford_ to enter into a social condition where the have nots are at constant risk of starvation and the nation in continuous low level insurgency.  Not in a landscape of 2050 where perhaps 2/3rds of 450 million souls fall into the genetically impoverished category of &#8216;never have, never will&rsquo; unfit workers.  But they all know how to use a club.</p>
<p>4.  Where &#8216;sharing&rsquo; intelligence means dropping the excuse of racial accommodation as a function of &#8216;acknowledging prejudice&rsquo; (as cover for unadmitted ineptitude) between certain population groups, there will be significant incentive to begin some _serious_ research into the long sequence DNA which pushes us all up the IQ/social cohesion ladder.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like living with these people.  The developing world places they come from are in dire need of a mouse-eats-elephant solution to bring their population numbers, civil wars and economic exploitation under home-ethny control.  And capitalism as it now stands is a rapacious beast that attacks it&rsquo;s owners as much as it&rsquo;s victims with no sign of an improved situation for any of us.</p>
<p>Maybe the key is to admit that the system is what is broken.  And shifting perspectives towards a lifestyle transition is what will jump start a better replacement.</p>

		<p>Betrayal of the founding people is an inherent feature of the welfare state, at least in the West  &mdash;   maybe the Japanese might resist it, assuming there are any Japanese left 100 years from now!</p>
<p>The welfare state and other tax-the-rich needs two classes to survive, and thrive  &mdash;   the eater-voters and the worker-payers. Whites are inherently better suited for the latter, so that&rsquo;s the class into which the state increasingly pushes them.</p>
<p>So Mick and other &#8220;national socialists&#8221; in the racial-realist community are, in fact, not racially realist on this issue.</p>

		<p>This intro to this article is based on all sorts of obsolete assumptions.  The USA is moving towards a third-world plutocratic model where a tiny number of rich control a rapidly increasing percentage of the nations wealth.  Most whites are worse off than they were 20 years ago.  That trend will accelerate as baby boomers with good jobs retire and are replace by younger whites on permanent &#8220;temp&#8221; status with no benefits or raises.  </p>
<p>The rich are one of the main forces driving the dispossession of whites through their support of open borders and multiculturalism.  Racially conscious whites should pray that these people have all their money confiscated, or worse.  America&rsquo;s wealthy elite is not all that white anymore either.</p>

		<p>I remember when I was in college and knew a lot of aspiring pre-med students who were bright, hard working and had very good grades but because there were too many doctors they were turned down by medical schools that had quite a few Indians [from India] taking up slots.  This was the 70&rsquo;s and the Indians were only there to learn for the sake of their country to which they were suppose to return, at least this was what we were told.  Well needless to say this didn&rsquo;t happen.  Instead the US got more and more Indian doctors and less white Christian American ones. The race and religion matters to me as I want someone of my belief system when I face health and life and death situations. These issues are heavily influenced by moral views.</p>
<p>I resent this subterfuge and believe this conniving between India&rsquo;s government and the US&rsquo;s has gone on for quite some time.  I distrust the Hindus and don&rsquo;t care for their superior attitude.  May they all return to bloom where they were planted  as was originally agreed.</p>

		<p>One last thing you so-called Conservatives must understand and accept. The less non-white influence in a country the more socialist it is. I.e Iceland,Finland, New Zealand etc. Sorry to burst your bubble but Conservatism as it is meant by the Rush Limbaughs of the world is the number one enemy of Whites worldwide. Now I am trying to figure who gains the most from our current system? Bottom line extreme wealth is not White it is an alien concept.</p>

		<p> <i>the old WASPs didn&rsquo;t even put up a very good fight to save themselves or their nation; and today the<br>
remaining WASP elite families have pretty much thrown in their lot with the new anti-white elitists who dethroned them, and they help them destroy our race and civilization. <br>
  <br>
Therefore, unless and until the remaining wealthy WASPs join in with those of us in the white nationalist community and resume fighting these enemies and dethrone THEM, and take OUR nation back - I have zero sympathy for them. As far as I am concerned, they deserve to be taxed at a 95% rate until they get the message: <br>
&ldquo;You do NOT betray your race and your nation.&rdquo;</i><br>
   &mdash;   Luke</p>
<p>(And if you do, you can&rsquo;t expect them to defend you in turn.)<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Great, great post from Luke (as always). Thank you, Luke. Yes, those battered, tattered remnants  that still remain of the former WASP elite have accepted the new situation and have made their accommodation with the new aristocracy who presently rule us;  they understand that this is the condition on which they are allowed to retain whatever social prestige and wealth they still have. They are standing on thin ice. One slip up, and they will be dispossesed.  So they will not speak up. They haven&rsquo;t dared to so far;  and they certainly won&rsquo;t now. Like the British royal family and European aristocrats today, their  only remaining power is tradition and social prestige. They know that if they became inconvenient, they would be swept away. So they go along and keep their months shut. As long as they play the  game, they are allowed to retain the (old and meaningless) trappings of power.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlike the new elite, their sole (and very short-sighted) preoccupation has always been to preserve THEIR OWN wealth, positions, and privileges without any similar racial concern for those of those own kind. That has been their (and our) fatal flaw   &mdash;   lack of any sense of solidarity.</p>
<p>As for Sureesh, I understand your gripe, but I think you are assigning yourself too large a role in the American scheme of things. East Indians (ie from India) are quite a new element in the American picture. You are still a tiny minority. Traditionally, when Americans speak/think of whites and non-whites, we do so in the context of Europeans vs. Africans.  Indians (Hindus) were not a part of the picture until very recently, and for the most part they still aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also, speaking for myself, I don&rsquo;t place that much emphasis on skin color alone. Race is much more complicated than that.  I realize that Indians, though darker-skinned, are still Caucasians, which African so-called  &#8220;blacks&#8221; are not. The two are NOT the same, racially.</p>
<p>Another thing, Sureesh: I very much doubt that <i>&#8220;Indo-Americans have the highest annual average income of any group in America&#8221;.</i> It all depends on how you choose to define those, uh, &#8220;groups&#8221;.  But I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt that yours is not the richest group, by any means. It&rsquo;s just that some (unlike you) prefer not to stand out and brag about their wealth and clout. They have learned that flaunting it is unwise. In fact, they would vociferously deny having any such thing. They would accuse you of being anti-something-or-other for even mentioning it. You have a lot yet to learn about the American scene.</p>

		</legend>
		<p>There are three storylines that are pounded home repeatedly by the mainstream media and the Republican Party ideologues.</p>
<p>More than 50% of Americans don&rsquo;t pay any taxes.<br>
The top 1% pays 38% of all the Federal income taxes.<br>
Increasing the highest tax rate above 35% would destroy jobs and kill small business owners.<br>
The misinformation spewed forth by the super rich, who control the media, politicians, and media message, to disguise their continued looting of the American middle class, is unrelenting. There are 117 million households in the United States with a median household income of $48,000. Data from the Tax Foundation shows that in 2008, the average income for the bottom half of taxpayers was $15,300. The first $9,350 of income is exempt from taxes for singles and $18,700 for married couples. Politicians of both parties also provided credits for children, earned income credits, mortgage tax deductions, property tax deductions, and a myriad of other tax goodie payoffs for votes. When half the households in the country make less than $48,000 per year in income, of course they won&rsquo;t be paying any Federal income taxes. There are approximately 151 million Americans earning income. Almost 73 million, or 48%, make less than $25,000. As Wall Street enriched billionaires are interviewed by millionaire journalists on CNBC, scorning those who don&rsquo;t pay their fair share of taxes, they outsource the blue collar jobs of those on the lower income scale to China and India. Without good paying jobs, the middle class uses debt to maintain their American dream, further enriching the billionaire class in a circle of death.</p>
<p>This chart reveals the true nature of who controls our country. It is a battle between a few thousand of the richest people in America versus the other 150 million. The facts are the middle class and poor pay a much higher percentage of their income in taxes than the rich. The Social Security tax cuts off at $106,800. Therefore, the median household pays 6.2% of their income, while the rich household making $5 million per year pays .13% of their income. This applies to sales taxes, property taxes, state taxes, local taxes and the thousand other taxes and fees charged on utility bills, etc. William Domhoff notes that the top 1% who make $1.3 million per year only pay 30.9% of their income in taxes, while those making $141,000 per year pay 31.5% of their income in taxes. I guess their tax lawyers aren&rsquo;t as well paid. Even those making $34,000 pay 27% of their income in taxes.</p>
<p>Source: Citizens for Tax Justice</p>
<p>The top 1% does pay 38% of the Federal income tax because they have a 23.5% share of the national income. The last time the top 1% reached this level of income was in 1928, just before the Great Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression. During the glory years of the American Empire, between 1946 and 1971, the top 1% of households&rsquo; share of the national income ranged between 8% and 13%. With the era of unbridled greed and debt that began in the 1980s, the inequitable distribution of wealth has risen to new heights. This level of pillaging by those in control of the finance sector of the economy, supported by their mouthpieces in Congress, and championed by their controlled media pundits, has reached a level that will eventually lead to revolution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The biggest lie pushed forth by the powerful super rich in this country is related to the top marginal tax rate, which is currently 35%. The Republican agenda includes a further cut in the top rate to 25%. It is sold to the American public as a good thing for them. It has nothing to do with them. The 35% rate applies to only taxable income over $379,000. Of the 151 million Americans earning a living, this rate would apply to about 200,000 people. The top marginal tax rates during the glory years of the American Empire (1946 – 1971) were between 70% and 90%. These rates only applied to taxable income above $400,000, when the average income was less than $10,000 per year. These were the best years for the American middle class.</p>
<p>The IRS issues an annual report on the 400 highest income tax payers. In 1961, there were 398 taxpayers who made $1 million or more. Today there are over 78,000 taxpayers who make more than $1 million. The loopholes written into the tax code over decades by lobbyists paid for by the super rich, plus much lower tax rates on the largest sources of income of the wealthy (capital gains taxed at 15%), explain why the average federal income tax rate on the 400 richest people in America was 18.11% in 2008, according to the IRS, down from 26.38% when this data were first calculated in 1992. Among the top 400, 7.5% had an average tax rate of less than 10%, 25% paid between 10% and 15%, and 28% paid between 15% and 20%. The average American&rsquo;s share of their income going to federal taxes increased from 13.1% in 1961 to 22.5% in 2008. William Domhoff explains how the super rich have paid off Congress to rig the system in their favor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to another analysis by Johnston (2010a), the average income of the top 400 tripled during the Clinton Administration and doubled during the first seven years of the Bush Administration. So by 2007, the top 400 averaged $344.8 million per person, up 31% from an average of $263.3 million just one year earlier. How are these huge gains possible for the top 400? It&rsquo;s due to cuts in the tax rates on capital gains and dividends, which were down to a mere 15% in 2007 thanks to the tax cuts proposed by the Bush Administration and passed by Congress in 2003. Since almost 75% of the income for the top 400 comes from capital gains and dividends, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why tax cuts on income sources available to only a tiny percent of Americans mattered greatly for the high-earning few. Overall, the effective tax rate on high incomes fell by 7% during the Clinton presidency and 6% in the Bush era, so the top 400 had a tax rate of 20% or less in 2007, far lower than the marginal tax rate of 35% that the highest income earners (over $372,650) supposedly pay.&rdquo; – Wealth, Income, and Power – William Domhoff</p>
<p>As an added bonus, hedge fund managers like John Paulson, who made $9 billion over two years, paid no income taxes on his windfall. In 2007, Republicans and a key Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, fought to keep the tax rate on hedge fund managers at 15%, arguing that the profits from hedge funds should be considered capital gains. Schumer, the ultra-liberal champion of the poor, knows who butters his bread – Wall Street. But it gets better. As long as they leave their money, known as &ldquo;carried interest,&rdquo; in the hedge fund, their taxes are deferred. They pay taxes only when they cash out, which could be decades from now. These upstanding citizens access their jackpot winnings by borrowing against the carried interest, often at rates as low as 2%. I&rsquo;m sure every youngster in America dreams of becoming a hedge fund manager so they can use system risking leverage to make bets on derivatives, reap billions in profits, pay no taxes, and produce no value for the country. The new American Dream.</p>
<p>It is plain to see by anyone without an ideological agenda that a few thousand corrupt individuals have managed to gain control of the American economic system. The introduction of the personal income tax and creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 have provided the means for the few to dominate the many. Over the last century, a rich super class has created their wealth through issuing debt to the masses, writing the tax code in their favor through their captive politician protectors, using their own private bank to issue trillions in fiat currency and create inflation, and used their control of the mass media to convince the average American that this was beneficial. Chris Whalen in his brilliant economic history of the United States – Inflated – How Money &amp; Debt Built the American Dream sums up what has happened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once the two functions, controlling the amount of currency in circulation, and second the government&rsquo;s fiscal operations, are housed under the same roof, inflation and a decrease in the value of money are the inevitable result. It is always easier to borrow than to raise taxes. Politicians who have access to the printing press will invariably use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small cabal of banking elite committed the crime of the century between 2001 and 2008. They used their power over the Federal Reserve and political class to reap hundreds of billions in ill-begotten profits and crashed the worldwide economic system in 2008. They then held the country hostage as they extorted trillions more in bailouts from the taxpayers. As a reward for their chutzpah, they have paid themselves billions in bonuses. While 44 million people try to make ends meet with food stamps, these criminals continue to pillage the countryside attempting to steal the remainder of middle class wealth. As the middle class sinks further into despair, anger is building. The political class has tried to pay off the poor with entitlement payments, but it is the middle class that will revolt when their hope for a better life is destroyed by the moneyed class. With debt in the system expanding at hyper-speed, the American Empire will not decline with a whimper but with a bang. All previous Fourth Turning&rsquo;s in U.S. history have resulted in tremendous bloodshed. The next ten years will follow this pattern. I&rsquo;ll address the coming revolution against the criminal banking element in the last part of this five part series – <br>

<p>1913 was also the year that the criminal international bankers managed to get their nation plundering crime syndicate, otherwise known as the Federal Reserve, established. No coincidence. These two events, i.e., the 16th Amendment and the Federal Reserve are intimately connected.</p>
<p>In essence, in the years following the enactment of the 16th Amendment - the anti-white, anti-Western aliens behind both of these abominations sought to use the US tax code in a confiscatory fashion to strip the wealth from the old WASP ruling elite class. This was done in order to help reduce their influence and power and to set the stage for a hostile, alien takeover of our nation by the current crop of anti-white, anti-Western, Cultural Marxist poisoned new class of ruling elites.</p>
<p>So, as we here at AR know all too well - this new ruling class is our mortal enemy and they seek the complete destruction of both the White descendants of the Founding Stock of this nation, and the death of Western Civilization - which is a product of the genius of our people.<br>

We non-elites have been told that if we just work harder, be better, and stay quiet, we might one day sit at the table.</p>
<p>We have suffered even unto the present with this aged old lie.  More whites are on welfare than ten years ago; Whites are losing their homes unable to pay rigged mortgages, while the banks that contrived those loans are posting record profits.  White men are unemployed or under-employed at alarming rates - all the while corporate profits are at all time highs.  Our jobs are being exported to far off countries while our children are becoming junkies and sending what little wealth we have left to dealers and pimps.<br>
 <br>
We are told that we are better than the rest of the trash out there. So we gladly, respectfully pick up arms, lose our limbs, and willingly die to defend, augment, and sustain the wealth of a few - always thinking we are better - lulled into thinking that one day, if we play the game right, we will be rewarded.  </p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a rigged game. A game that only profits a few. However, the  game only continues as long as the vast, brain-washed middle class feel they have something to lose - the reality is, they never had anything to begin with.</p>
<p>So we can hate the blacks and the browns all we want. We can blame them for our demise and hold them accountable for what we think has happened to us. But they know what has happened to them; they know they were used by the wealthy and the entitled - we whites are just beginning to sense the same abuse and coming to the same conclusions. And as we continue to lose that which we believed we deserved, we will undoubtedly wake up from this American hoax and hopefully join ranks to settle an ancient debt. </p>
<p>So yeah, tax the rich cause I&rsquo;m not one of them, and they have gotten plenty of ill gotten gains from the sweat and blood of my brothers and sisters.</p>

And as we continue to lose that which we believed we deserved, we will undoubtedly wake up from this American hoax and hopefully join ranks to settle an ancient debt. </p>
<p>So yeah, tax the rich cause I&rsquo;m not one of them, and they have gotten plenty of ill gotten gains from the sweat and blood of my brothers and sisters.</p>

One last thing you so-called Conservatives must understand and accept. The less non-white influence in a country the more socialist it is. I.e Iceland,Finland, New Zealand etc. Sorry to burst your bubble but Conservatism as it is meant by the Rush Limbaughs of the world is the number one enemy of Whites worldwide. <br>

Contrary to what Karl Marx believed, loyalties of race, nation, and ethnicity are usually stronger than loyalties of class. <br>
 <br>
The New Deal was only possible during the 1930s because civil rights legislation was kept off the agenda.<br>
 <br>
The result of the civil rights legislation of the 1960s has not been racial equality; it has been a Republican white working class, and consequently greater income inequality. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Non_Whites want your money&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny given that 66% of welfare recipients are white. Where I live, Non-whites are the rich. Jews, Persians, and Asians are living in Beverly Hills, Hancock Park,and Brentwood. Whites are sequestered in the outlying areas of Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. Each it&rsquo;s own mecca of pickup trucks, mobile homes, and chronic unemployment.<br>

<p>No, nonwhites are the majority of welfare recipients. Mexicans and blacks far outnumber Whites in CA who collect all kinds of benefits. Many are frauds, as they make money under the table, are illegals, many with fake ID&rsquo;s. Many are unwed mothers who have kid after kid by different men to stay on the dole. Many are drug addicts. I ALWAYS hear that Whites make up the majority and they DO NOT! It is a lie. I know, because I worked where I saw it all. Those whites who do collect benefits have NONwhite babies so they are considered nonwhite in my eyes.</p>

		<p>Since 1980 real after tax income for eighty percent of the American population has declined. For the richest twenty percent it has increased. For the richest one percent it has increased dramatically.<br>

This is what the economy looked like when George W. Bush left office: &#8220;On every major measurement, the Census Bureau report shows that the country lost ground during Bush&rsquo;s two terms. While Bush was in office, the median household income declined, poverty increased, childhood poverty increased even more, and the number of Americans without health insurance spiked.&#8221;<br>

Although unemployment has increased since the inauguration of President Obama, so have profits: &#8220;American businesses earned profits at an annual rate of $1.659 trillion in the third quarter [of 2010], according to a Commerce Department report released Tuesday. That is the highest figure recorded since the government began keeping track over 60 years ago.<br>

Those of us who favor a more progressive tax system do not want to raise taxes on all whites. We want those of us who are white wage earners to enjoy a better share of the wealth we create with our labor.  </p>

I read in a book of advice to American businessmen not to feel arrogant or superior to their Latin Amerrican counterparts. The fact is that their Latin counterparts are, on average,likely to be three times richer than they are.</p>
<p>Yes, there is great poverty all around, but there is great wealth too.  I have seen mansions (palaces really) in Latin America that have no rival anywhere in the USA.</p>
<p>In Latin America, and the Third World, those who have it like to flaunt it.</p>

		<p>Folks here need to get away from endless discussions, obsessions with &#8220;TAXES&#8221;, ECONOMICS, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.</p>
<p>Blacks took over Detroit, Zimbabwe not by wasting their time talking, talking about taxes and money. Same goes with Mexicans taking over Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We need to be more like Blacks, Mexicans and simply live, procreate - push our own race&rsquo;s interest - support White sports figures, White musicians, think and work internationally White - same as hispanics or Muslims.</p>
<p>Does anyone really care what the marginal tax rate will be in all parts of America if our demographics become the same as Haiti, Zimbabwe, Algeria?</p>
<p>I wonder if the Whites in Haiti during the Black uprisings/genocide of Whites were wasting all their time discussing taxes and economics.<br>

		<p>I favor taxing the rich at 99% provided that &#8220;the rich&#8221; is restricted to:</p>
<p>George Soros, big backer of Obama, open borders, and every crazy left wing idea.</p>
<p>Bill Gates, whose Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has a scholarship available to every race in America except white people.</p>
<p>Warren Buffet, another Obama cheerleader who gave lots of money to Bill&rsquo;s foundation.</p>
<p>Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs.  Employees of Goldman Sachs were the biggest contributors to Obama&rsquo;s campaign, and an ex-employee has said that people working for that company are informed in no uncertain terms that they are to help fund the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Morris Dees   &mdash;   he&rsquo;s not in the same league as the guys above, but he made plenty of money first with junk mail and then by creating the country&rsquo;s most lavishly funded hate group.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;d be happy to also tax the neocon Republicans who favor open borders, cheap immigrant labor, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on unending wars in the Middle East that accomplish nothing.  I&rsquo;m looking at you, George W. Bush and John McCain.</p>
<p>The Republicans   &mdash;   the party of millionaires.<br>
The Democrats   &mdash;   the party of billionaires.</p>
<p>We bomb other countries into &#8220;democracy&#8221; while giving working and middle class white Americans no party that represents their interests.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they&rsquo;d stop lumping all non-whites in one big group- Indo-Americans are far less likely to be on welfare than whites and have the highest annual average income of any group in America. We pay more than our fair share of taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a now five year unemployed, well educated white male with a productive history behind me, I want the job you came here and took from me back.</p>
<p>The U.S. has no business importing workers from foreign countries in a time of extended &#8220;recession.&#8221;  Such a thing used to be unthinkable, but now we have posters like this one who represents thousands who feel they deserve credit for not being unemployed in a country they arrived in for the purpose of displacing whites citizens from their jobs.  The real blame goes to people like Bill Gates.</p>
