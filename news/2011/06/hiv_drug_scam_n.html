<h1>HIV Drug Scam: NYC Doctor Busted for Doling Out Meds Patients Didn&rsquo;t Need, Prosecutors Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Jacarrino and Melissa Grace, NY Daily News, June 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Washington Heights doctor was busted in a $700,000 Medicaid scam for prescribing HIV drugs to a stunning 150 patients who did not have the virus  &mdash;  and billing the public health system for their care, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Suresh Hemrajani, 57, pleaded not guilty to grand larceny and health care fraud Friday and posted $200,000 bond after appearing before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman.</p>
<p>The charges against Hemrajani followed the indictment of 30 people, all poor Medicaid patients who were recruited off the streets by middlemen, &#8220;sometimes 10 at a time,&#8221; according to court records.</p>
<p>Hemrajani, who lives in a $610,000 White Plains home, was arrested after prosecutors won convictions against 17 of the patients  &mdash;  even securing state prison sentences against some. Many of them are cooperating in the probe, sources said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials said the recruited patients were brought to the doctor&rsquo;s office where Hemrajani wrote them prescriptions for HIV meds without even conducting an exam.</p>
<p>The patients, who used Medicaid to pay for the prescriptions, were paid cash for the meds by a middleman, who in turn sold the drugs on the black market.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Diversity dentists like to bill the insurance company for dental work that was never done.  They bill the insurance company for a root canal for a certain teeth (each tooth in your mouth has a number) and you don&rsquo;t find out about it until you really do need a root canal for that tooth, possibly decades later, and you are accused of fraud at that point.  OR you are informed that you have reached your coverage maximum for the year, and you wonder why, because you&rsquo;ve only had your teeth cleaned   &mdash;   but Diversity Dentist has billed the insurance company for thousands of dollars worth of work.  &#8220;What do you care what the bill is, nobody is asking YOU to pay it,&#8221; says Diversity Dentist.</p>
<p>In the past, I accepted whatever dentist or doctor I was assigned.  About two years ago, I decided to avoid Diversity Professionals, mostly due to their propensity for running scams rather than their high rate of incompetence and inability to speak understandable English.  But the whole Diversity Experience has worn me down, and now I make sure that I am seen by Whitey.</p>

		<p>Many Asians come to America with their own version of the American dream, which is to &#8216;make it&rsquo; in the first generation, scruples be damned.</p>
<p>Even if they get caught and go to jail, their kids will still be American passport holders.  <br>

		<p>Medicaid and medicare scams have cost us BILLIONS in the last 20 or 30 years and almost ALL of it comes from these foreign &#8220;doctors&#8221; we have allowed in our country. So we will have to suffer when it is all cut off BECAUSE of these nonwhite cheats! They also run medical supply chains and do the same thing scamming medicaid and medicare in the BILLIONS, </p>
<p>The patients, who used Medicaid to pay for the prescriptions, were paid cash for the meds by a middleman, who in turn sold the drugs on the black market.</p>
<p>As for these &#8220;patients&#8221; getting paid to participate in the fraud for a measly $50 (from what I heard) they all should be sentenced to 10 years in prison. It cannot be hard to find these people since their medicare cards have all their info. I will wager these &#8220;patients&#8221; are all nonwhites and immigrants. </p>

		<p>Is 700,000 his profit or the total of the scam?  It can not be the total of the scam because HIV drugs cost thousands of dollars a month and I bet 30 patients is just the tip of the iceberg.  He probably cost Medicaid (aka the white tax payer) millions of dollars.  Here in NJ FamilyCare (a Medicaid program) stopped covering working-poor adults because the program ran out of money.  How many people in NY are not getting coverage because of people like him?  How many white working people are told &#8220;no coverage, no treatment, go home and die&#8221; when diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>We do not need these leeches here in America.  Send them packing.  Let them help India.</p>

		<p>This happens EVERY DAY in Chicago. Any fool with a medicaid card can get 25 bucks a day going to  a crooked Doc who works with middlemen who then resell the drugs on the black market. Oxycontin is commonly diverted into the drug trade this way. The &#8216;patients&rsquo; are also given a bonus if they can find other cardholder to come join them in this scheme. </p>

<p>Where they were bought using US welfare dollars by Africans who smoked them as their recreational drug of choice.</p>
<p>The article leaves out this most important point.  The one that should have all aid to africa and all money used to treat aids in the third world cut off immediately.</p>
<p>I would place the number of aids patients legitimately treated at close to zero.  Only a small fraction of hiv drugs aren&rsquo;t seized immediately to be sold as the latest substitute for crack cocaine.  The little that do reach patients, are either sold (in order to use the money to buy their drug of choice, instead) or smoked to get high.  Note that whether or not you can actually get high smoking hiv drugs is&hellip;..controversial.  More myth than reality.  Literally, the placebo effect manifest in drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Nobody, except whites, has any interest whatsoever in treating aids&hellip;.not even the guys that will die within weeks without treatment&hellip;..they ALL prefer to get high instead.</p>
<p>This story simply doesn&rsquo;t make any sense until you know about these things.</p>

		<p>Just a thought: This guy is only doing what other people in the AIDS Industry (That&rsquo;s right, buddy, it&rsquo;s an INDUSTRY in case you haven&rsquo;t figured it out) are doing and that is prescribe medicines where medicines aren&rsquo;t even needed. Of course most HIV?AIDS drugs are toxic and will kill you faster than any disease will, but they&rsquo;re not gonna tell you that! The whole idea of the AIDS pandemic is to scare people into spending as much money as possible because they think that their health is at risk, get them sick, and watch as many die as possible. The ruling class quite often bemoans about the overpopulation problem, and for anyone to think that these people care about the general health of the populace is quite amusing to me.</p>

Back in my day, (sigh!) there was a middleman at the bar who made a living sending or escorting new patients to get the latest wonder drug, Qualuudes. The joke going around was that their were three file cabinets in the Doctor`s office. A-M, N-Z and &#8220;Referred to By H_____ P_____. </p>
