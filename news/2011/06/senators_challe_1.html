			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NumbersUSA, June 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The letter that was sent to Pres. Obama earlier today asks the President for clarification on the use of deferred action or parole for illegal aliens. The executive actions are typically used in special cases and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but if 60 votes can&rsquo;t be secured in the Senate to pass a mass Amnesty, the Administration may use the discretionary actions as an alternative.</p>
<p>Here is the text of the letter signed by Sens. Grassley, Hatch (R-Utah), Vitter (R-La.), Bunning (R-Ky.), Chambliss (R-Ga.), Isakson (R-Ga.), Inhofe (R-Okla.), and Cochran (R-Miss.).</p>
<blockquote>Dear President Obama:
<p>We understand that there&rsquo;s a push for your Administration to develop a plan to unilaterally extend either deferred action or parole to millions of illegal aliens in the United States. We understand that the Administration may include aliens who have willfully overstayed their visas or filed for benefits knowing that they will not be eligible for a status for years to come. We understand that deferred action and parole are discretionary actions reserved for individual cases that present unusual, emergent or humanitarian circumstances. Deferred action and parole were not intended to be used to confer a status or offer protection to large groups of illegal aliens, even if the agency claims that they look at each case on a &#8220;case-by-case&#8221; basis.</p>
<p>While we agree our immigration laws need to be fixed, we are deeply concerned about the potential expansion of deferred action or parole for a large illegal alien population. While deferred action and parole are Executive Branch authorities, they should not be used to circumvent Congress&rsquo; constitutional authority to legislate immigration policy, particularly as it relates to the illegal population in the United States.</p>
<p>The Administration would be wise to abandon any plans for deferred action or parole for the illegal population. Such a move would further erode the American public&rsquo;s confidence in the federal government and its commitment to securing the borders and enforcing the laws already on the books.</p>
<p>We would appreciate receiving a commitment that the Administration has no plans to use either authority to change the current position of a large group of illegal aliens already in the United States, and ask that you respond to us about this matter as soon as possible.<br>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s current policy on reasons not to enforce immigration law are here:</p>

<p>Some of the ways you can avoid being deported:</p>
<p>1.  Attend a community college.</p>
<p>2.  Be pregnant or nursing.  (Crank out that anchor baby!)</p>
<p>3.  Have a relative in the armed forces.</p>
<p>4.  Be physically or mentally disabled.  (We need the world&rsquo;s crazy people and AIDS cases.)</p>
<p>I remember the days when immigration authorities were sensible and carrying a transmissible and dangerous disease was a reason <i>not</i> to let you into the country.</p>

		<p>Obama couldn&rsquo;t get his amnesty passed in one sweeping bill, so he will go about it piecemeal style. Obama will not give up until the 30+ million (not counting those who will come via chain migrations) illegal invaders currently squatting on US soil are safe and secure with some form of legal status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already begun&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Such an action on the part of President Obama would be in effect a declaration of open war on white American citizens.  it would be a disaster most likely to end in civil war.  this would about the most insane thing he could do.  i am sure he is up to something regarding illegals hence the opening of the civil rights division in the dept of justice during a time of relative quiet in civil rights  it is an open admission that something is coming that will generate a land office rush of business for them in that line.  he would have to immediately declare martial law after amnesty to hope to stay in power.</p>

		<p>When is anyone in Washingtn going to develop a backbone? We&rsquo;ve got to stop putting band aids on the wound. It&rsquo;s too serious and has been for a long time. Let&rsquo;s heal it once and for all. We need a complete moratorium on ALL immigration for ten years.We need to demand that all illegals leave - Eisenhower did it and the world kept turning. Stop the birthright giveaway and all benefits to help along the self-deportation. Then, militarize our border. Illegals won&rsquo;t tangle with an armed, six-foot marine. Our country would profit financially and would not be subjected to the crime and destruction by third world lawbreakers.</p>

		<p>When Obama can&rsquo;t get things through  Congress he does so with his  administration.  Classic example is the EPA and global warming. Congress wouldn&rsquo;t pass laws against global warming so the EPA is going handle the situation.  Many other examples, however, as to immigration, Obama made all kinds of promises to the Hispanic voter and didn&rsquo;t come though.  He&rsquo;s been taken task  by the Latino lobby and this new scheme is to respond to their demands and hopefully give them reason to vote for him again after they were burned the first time.</p>
<p>Can America survive Obama?</p>

		<p>There was a time when being an American citizen was earned, not just given away to over-breeders and criminals. The current admin doesn&rsquo;t care who comes to America, as long as they vote Democrat so he and his cronies can keep their power ($) base.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to come to that, either way.  We will either go bankrupt until some outside force (China unpinning the RMB) drives us over the edge and the low level insurgency we are already suffering becomes an ipso facto&rsquo;d consequence.</p>
<p>Or it begins early with such an obviously racial and arbitrary declaration of White Genocidal Intent that Americans FINALLY wake up and realize that the items on the agenda: universal health care, wars overseas etc., are not what they care about.  And _rather than acknowledge this openly_, Obama has instead decided to admit to it by his silence.  And we rise up to impeach him for his off the books admission.</p>
<p>IMO, each option has it&rsquo;s unwelcomed consequences.  If we go to full contact civil war while our government can actually afford to pay it&rsquo;s (para)military forces, we will will put the elites and technology on one side and us on the other.</p>
<p>If we instead wait for the ants to crush us beneath a social welfare debacle as the economy collapses under a post-peak oil condition and there are massive municipal bankruptcies across the nation, we will inherit a wasteland.  But we will also be small and young enough that we will not ourselves be overburdened by a massive eldery population in a time of war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the latter factor that counts, IMO.  We cannot exist as we are.  We have to consider the post-U.S. condition and not be slow to implement the precursors to having the kind of population that can win a massive racial conflict with enough bodies in one spot to create a white homeland, after.</p>

 i am sure he is up to something regarding illegals hence the opening of the civil rights division in the dept of justice during a time of relative quiet in civil rights it is an open admission that something is coming that will generate a land office rush of business for them in that line.

		<p>Obama is doing this because he can. Really, who&rsquo;s going to stop him? Sending him this letter is stupid; like he&rsquo;s not going to laugh at it. Obama is an authoritarian kind of person who doesn&rsquo;t think in the way of consensus or democracy style governing. Again, he&rsquo;s laughing about the objection from Republicans because his mind set is totally different and knows there are no consequences for his actions. He knows most Republicans are weak, and the ones that are strong can be marginalized. </p>
