			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Chapman, Chicago Tribune, June 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Here&rsquo;s my question about the teenagers who have been attacking and robbing people on North Michigan Avenue in recent days: Were they Christians? And if so, what denomination? Baptist? Catholic? Seventh Day Adventist?</p>
<p>Those may sound like ridiculous questions. But so is the question raised by many Tribune readers about our coverage: Why aren&rsquo;t we mentioning that the culprits are black? </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>If a reporter goes out and interviews people about the weather, would it make sense for the story to say, &#8220;Joe Smith, who is black, is hoping for a cool front&#8221;? If a pedestrian gets run over by a bicyclist, should the story mention that the rider was white?</p>
<p>In the attack coverage, what difference does race make, unless police are putting out descriptions or sketches in hopes of getting tips from witnesses? {snip} </p>
<p>And what good would it do to trumpet the skin color of the thugs? So pedestrians on Michigan Avenue can run away when they see two or more African-Americans? {snip} </p>
<p>My question to readers accusing us of political correctness is: Why do you care so much about the attackers&rsquo; race? If you fear or dislike blacks, I suppose it would confirm your prejudice. But otherwise, it tells you nothing useful.</p>

<p>The idiocy evident in this absurd analogy ought to disqualify the author from commentary upon anything more serious than the weather.</p>

<p>Yes, whether criminal behavior is exponentially more common among blacks is not a useful thing to know. Idiot.</p>

		<p><i>Were they Christians?</i></p>
<p>They probably were.  Christianity is really popular in the black community.  Albeit a version that is rather bereft of theology and moral teaching, but very high on jubilation, singing and volume.  But it goes to show that just professing Christianity does not make one less inclined to violence.</p>

		<p>What an incredibly naive article. People want to know for the simple reason that the more information one has about perpetrators of crimes, one is better able to judge the relative safety one enjoys in a given situation. Ask Jesse Jackson to explain the remark he made years ago about feeling relief at discovering that the footsteps behind him on a dark street were those of some Whites and not blacks. </p>
<p>And yes, knowing the race of the perps, given that they are, in fact, black, simply reinforces my desire to avoid them when at all possible. If I were told that wild dogs were frequently found in a certain section of town, I would avoid that section of town. Normally intelligent folks try to avoid danger. Why is this fact so hard for the author of the article so hard to understand?</p>

		<p>Hmm&hellip; I wonder if gangs of teenage white lower middle class males banded together, picked a black middle class neighborhood, then traveled there as a group, got off and then went on a fast paced series of violent attacks and robberies on terrified black people (plus a Japanese tourist)&hellip;</p>
<p>would anyone be bringing up race?</p>

		<p>Simple answer Mr. Chapman:</p>
<p>1) It helps identify the perps.  </p>
<p>2) It is obvious that the incidents are racially motivated.  </p>
<p>If packs of feral white teens were attacking black adults the press would be screaming racism and implying that lynching was returning.</p>
<p>This I why I stopped buying the newspaper.  The reporting is so biased.</p>

		<p>What a dope this reporter is. If roving gangs of people wearing red hats were randomly harming only white citizens, that red hat marker would be relevant.  Whites would be forewarned if they saw a group of red hats coming their way.  Not everyone wearing a red hat would be dangerous, but some would be and it would provide an important bit of information to avoid harm.  Do I need to continue the analogy? You know, like when the clouds get darker, it often rains? </p>

		<p>We all know the drill. The race is irrelevant because it doesn&rsquo;t fit a tidy narrative with which the politically-correct and agenda-driven can identify. Let a mob of whites attack black civilians, and watch the locutions that Mr. Chapman of the Tribune goes through in order to point out how race is the centerpiece of the story in question, because these white flashmobs highlight a pervasive racism that Obama&rsquo;s ascent has done nothing to end. The first step, Mr. Chapman will say, should be to recognize that these violent white flashmobs should be seen as a cousin to the tea-party phenomenon, which is really just a cover for racism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he won&rsquo;t get his chance to grandstand in this fashion, because there isn&rsquo;t going to be any white on black mob attack. There will however continue to be black-on-white attacks. And men like the author of this article in question will continue to dutifully sidestep the issue, while gingerly doing a bee-line from the taxi, to the office, to the penthouse.</p>

		<p>Steve Chapman is a longtime syndicated libertarian columnist who simply can&rsquo;t understand that race is the primary motive behind the attacks   &mdash;   and that by harping on race, we just might prevent such attacks in the future.  All the market &#8220;incentives&#8221; in the world aren&rsquo;t going to make blacks behave.  Libertarians as a whole can&rsquo;t deal with this reality.   </p>

As with any other racially tinged topic, all you have to do is give this the &#8220;What if&#8221; test.  &#8220;What if&#8221; the races were reversed   &mdash;  - gangs of whites all across the country were doing the exact same thing&hellip;to blacks?</p>
<p>This very same media would blast headlines like, &#8220;Racist attacks becoming more common&#8221;, &#8220;Elderly black couple viciously beaten in racially motivated attack&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>And naturally, there would be exponentially more hand wringing and shrieking&hellip;by both the media and the politicians with non-stop focus on the racial motivations of the attackers.</p>
<p>And the controlled media wonders why fewer and fewer people take them serious as each year passes.</p>

		<p>Here is my answer: There is no Christian crime wave, and there never has been. </p>
<p>Instead there is a black crime wave, yet again. The race of suspects is germaine, but only dwelt on if they are white, especially if the MSM can tar them with racist or neo-Nazi connections. Otherwise it is ignored or excused. Hence your article, Mr. Chapman, and its blame the victim take on the story.</p>

<i>&#8220;Were they Christians? And if so, what denomination? Baptist? Catholic? Seventh Day Adventist? Those may sound like ridiculous questions.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>UGH! These people can&rsquo;t even find relevant analogies. And yes, these sound like ridiculous quests because they are.</p>
<p><i>If a reporter goes out and interviews people about the weather, would it make sense for the story to say, &ldquo;Joe Smith, who is black, is hoping for a cool front&rdquo;? If a pedestrian gets run over by a bicyclist, should the story mention that the rider was white?</i></p>
<p>To the first question about weather. No. There&rsquo;s no reason to mention the race of the man who was interviewed UNLESS the story is about how different races react to weather conditions.</p>
<p>As for the second question. IF the rider of the bike hit the pedestrian and biked away, he should be identified by this race because it helps people and the  police to identify the suspect. IF the rider hit the pedestrian and then stopped to help and talk to the police, then no, there&rsquo;s no reason to identify the bike rider by race because he is self-identified.</p>
<p>These people keep trying to cloud the issue and their arguments are becoming increasing absurd and they know it.</p>
<p><i>My question to readers accusing us of political correctness is: Why do you care so much about the attackers&rsquo; race? If you fear or dislike blacks, I suppose it would confirm your prejudice. But otherwise, it tells you nothing useful.</i></p>
<p>My question to reporters and editors, why is gender considered relevant when reporting a crime? Why is gender considered useful information in identifying a suspect but race is not?</p>

<p>Nothing useful???  How about avoiding groups of black youths, who make up the flash mobs?  A major and important fact in self-protection.  It also tells you that you don&rsquo;t have to fear, or run away from, or avoid, other groups, and except where black youths are involved, one can travel, walk, move, shop, exist in peace.</p>

		<p>The answer Mr. Chapman is quite simple and you know it.</p>
<p>If bands of Asian males in red Mazda&rsquo;s are doing drive-by shootings at random, wouldn&rsquo;t you want the public to be on the lookout for such suspects and to report or avoid them? </p>
<p>Would it serve public safety better to report that people of no specific gender or race and driving vehicles of no specific make or color are doing random drive-by shootings?</p>
<p>In crime reporting, maximum and specific characteristics about suspects are absolutely necessary and that fact shouldn&rsquo;t even need an explanation. But then you are not interested in facts. You have an agenda you must maintain so you can keep getting a paycheck.</p>

		<p><i>But otherwise, it tells you nothing useful.</i><p>Um, it tells you what the perpetrators LOOKED LIKE, Mr. Sanctimoniously Tolerant And Non-racist.  Describing what crime suspects LOOKED LIKE helps lead to their apprehension: their apparent age, their height, what they were wearing, their COLOR OR RACE.  How can people (including the police) be any help in a crime investigation if they don&rsquo;t know what the suspects LOOKED LIKE? Don&rsquo;t you and your smarmy ilk get that?<p>The posturing of this piece is just too stupid by half.  Who wants to bet that when this holier-than-thou bluenose ever gets jacked on the street by his precious African wards, he doesn&rsquo;t miss a split second in describing the race of his accosters when reporting the crime to the police?  </p></p></p>

		<p>If these youffs were Baptist or Catholic Seminarians, I&rsquo;m sure we would hear about it. Generally, it is difficult here in the US to tell someones religion by the way they are dressed. However, if it is a woman covered from head to toe in a chador or with certain types of head covering, it might be obvious. These are not White or Asian youths who are wilding. Yes, pedestrians will run or avoid the Miracle Mile if they think that they will be attacked. You can shop over the internet or go elsewhere while you are also bitterly clinging to your guns and religion.  </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d guess at least 95 percent of them are harmless.&#8221; We&rsquo;re not worried about the harmless ones, we&rsquo;re worried about the ones who wish to do us bodily harm. BTW, in that video where the kid in Chicago was beaten to death with 2 x 4&rsquo;s, there was not one White person to be seen. Two White kids who steal a garden gnome and post the pictures with it from their summer vacation on Facebook is not the same as a home invasion burglary with sawed-off shotguns. Yes, there is theft involved, but on two totally different levels. While the homeowner might laugh about his gnome going to visit Mt. Rushmore; he will not be laughing about being terrorized is his abode.  </p>

		<p>What an unscientific, idiotic attitude.  Why report the obvious?  Stating the glaringly obvious fact that flashmobbers are 99.99% black is not useful information.  Huh?</p>
<p>And when investigating terrorism, looking at the ethnicity and religious affliations of the suicide bombers is a total waste of time.</p>
<p>And if you are studying lung cancer, then noting the connection between smoking and getting lung cancer is of no use.  </p>
<p>There is something hilarious about these people.  They just deny reality and promote the fantasy ideal they want.  No logic, no accountability, just childish idealism unfettered by science or reality.  </p>

		<p>This commentary is insulting, condescending and down right childish. Comparing wheather race should be mentioned in an interview about weather and a gang of thugs robbing and beating innocent people senseless is just absurd. According to this moron, the police are the only ones who need to know the race of the attackers, never mind the average joe walking around unaware of whats going on. And yes Steve, it WOULD be a good idea to run away if one sees more than two or three blacks walking towards them. But according to you, that would make them fearful and predjudice despite all these numerous attacks by black males.</p>
<p>But you know what Steve? Whitey has it figured out anyway, so report race or not, anytime you mention &#8220;mob&#8221; or &#8220;gang&#8221; or outright omit race altogether, most of us know EXACTLY who you are talking about. If your readers are complaining, it&rsquo;s because they are sick of people like YOU trying to cover up the the high black crime rate, making excuses for them, and refusing to address you have a problem with your &#8220;youth.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This fool is a typical member of the MSM. If blacks are pulled over three percent more often than whites for routine traffic checks, then it becomes a federal issue and cause of much handwringing, and the media is all over it. If blacks are not present in exactly the prescribed percentages in a housing complex then the media is all over that. If blacks are not the proper percentage of police or firefighters, then guess what? Another federal issue. If whites commit so-called hate crimes, then oh my God! It&rsquo;s front page news! But if blacks commit a higher percentage of obviously race-related crimes, then suddenly we&rsquo;re not supposed to notice. This is of course the way the MSM wants things to work: they tell us what to believe and we believe what they tell us.</p>

		<p>My question to readers accusing us of political correctness is: Why do you care so much about the attackers&rsquo; race? If you fear or dislike blacks, I suppose it would confirm your prejudice. But otherwise, it tells you nothing useful.<br>
 <br>
- Steve Chapman, Chicago Tribune, June 8, 2011<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
It tells us a great deal that is useful. Blacks have a rate of violent crime that is nearly eight times the white rate. Being reminded of this fact through news stories tells us where we should live, which neighborhoods to avoid, especially after dark, and when we should feel a sense of alarm. <br>
 <br>
The high rate of black crime also has legitimate policy implications. In &#8220;The Inequality Taboo,&#8221; Charles Murray wrote, &#8220;specific policies based on premises that conflict with scientific truths about human beings tend not to work. Often they do harm.&#8221;<br>

<p>That may, or may not be true, but when the other 5% are caught, it is the other 95% who &#8220;Black&#8221; activists can easily whip into a frenzied mob in support of the behavior of the 5%. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I posted on the original article:</p>
<p>Your article and way of reporting crime imply that nothing can be learned from knowing the race of the criminals after a crime has been committed.</p>
<p>You imply that there are a complete absence of trends that would be beneficial to the public.</p>
<p>You are wrong. </p>
<p>For example, doj.gov has FBI crime statistics broken down by race. In 2005, over 37,000 white girls were raped by black men. Zero (0) black girls were raped by white men (there is an asterisk stating 0-10).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think some beneficial conclusions could be draw from those statistics by black girls in a white neighborhood or white girls who were thinking of going into black neighborhoods?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be naive.</p>

<p>Those may sound like ridiculous questions. </p>
<p>The other ridiculous question is, why is not being mentioned the people assaulted are white? Of course if the situation was reversed and it were  white  thugs  doing this to innocent black people we can assume you would also keep quiet about the thugs race? </p>

		<p>Why mention that the assailants were male?  The vast majority of males are not criminals, isn&rsquo;t it unnecessarily sexist to point out they are males?  Why mention what the offense was?  After all, these young boys were clearly just victims of racism which caused them to act out.  Why mention where or who the victims were?  That just raises hysteria unnecessarily - after all, most days a given block is not the scene of a violent crime.</p>
<p>Chicago Tribune should have the following for all of its crime stories from now on - &#8220;someone did something to someone somewhere.&#8221;  It would convey about the same adherence to accurately reporting stories, at least that way they can be sure they aren&rsquo;t being racist.  We all know, that is the worst crime of all, far worse than assault.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is why print is a dead medium, and mainstream media outlets are quickly fading to insignificance.  I hope they enjoy their extinction.</p>

		<p>Race is only unmentionable only when the race is &lsquo;black&rsquo;, as this goes against the media&rsquo;s agenda in how they want to portray the world, if some group of idiot White kid &lsquo;w*****s&rsquo;, imitated this flash mob phenomenon, I bet you that their race would be heavily emphasized in every possible degree as figurative front page news spread far and (world) wide, as proof that certain crimes aren&rsquo;t favored by specific racial groups. Until a counter event like this happens, complete racial censorship will be the rule.</p>
<p>The truth is that some issues in this world are &lsquo;racial&rsquo;; but these reporters don&rsquo;t want to appear to be &lsquo;racist&rsquo; in reporting about these actual racial events that have occurred factually, as to avoid reinforcing a negative racial narrative or stereotype to those of us who can see that some issues are racial i.e. &lsquo;the racists&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Like the situation with the COPS TV show producer story a few weeks ago where they have to come up with their own racial quota system which is contrary to the truth of the information that they have at their disposal. Ironically though when trying to avoid being a &lsquo;racist&rsquo; by favoring one racial group over the other in the editing process, aren&rsquo;t these news men just becoming what they&rsquo;re trying to avoid?</p>
<p>To me by covering up the facts, these journalists are becoming accessories in the crime that they are reporting, if you had a friend who committed a murder and they asked you to hide the murder weapon or cover up facts that would lead to their prosecution, you&rsquo;d be charged as a co-conspirator. At the least by placating the criminals, the media are working as enablers.<br>
   <br>
The media, I thought was meant to be the public&rsquo;s liaison (eyes, ears and voice) between criminal events and ourselves. Instead of objective reporting, these journalists see themselves as some sort of moral buffer or filter, favoring the criminal&rsquo;s rights over the safety of the community. </p>
<p>In reality this stance does no service to anyone in this relationship i.e. the perpetrators, the integrity of the journalistic profession or to the reader, by invoking this &lsquo;Black privilege&rsquo; or &lsquo;positive racism&rsquo; (or by whatever baloney word/phrase they call this process by) they are doing nothing to discourage these crimes and are actually creating more &lsquo;work&rsquo; for themselves, when I say work I mean lies than need to be spun and remember omission is a form of lying.</p>
<p>Giving criminals who have &lsquo;a child like mentality&rsquo; a free ride with little or no accountability by avoiding the shaming process, they are conditioning the black criminal&rsquo;s behavior to think that their crimes are somehow &ldquo;not crimes&rdquo; in the public&rsquo;s eye, which really just empowers the black criminal mentality (crime=silence/sympathy/justification). </p>
<p>So these crimes are never going to stop and the main stream media are going to have to create more lies and become more ambiguous to cover up the ever growing mountain of inconvenient truths that occur out there in the world daily. </p>
<p>It is of no wonder that the main stream media is seen as so irrelevant these days, as they no longer objectively report what they see, but they &lsquo;report&rsquo; what they want us viewers/readers to see or at least what we&rsquo;re deemed to be allowed to see.</p>
<p>Compare how today&rsquo;s journalist&rsquo;s operate to the <br>
&lsquo;Canons of Journalism&rsquo;<br>
(Ethical rules adopted by the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 28, 1923).<br>

Where ideals like &hellip;.Responsibility, Freedom of the Press, Independence, Sincerity, Truthfulness, Accuracy, Impartiality, Fair Play and Decency are cited.</p>

		<p>GWS- #29- I don&rsquo;t have actual proof on this or the crime stats, but I&rsquo;d bet a paycheck or two that a high percentage of those black male-on-White female rapes occurred in the White women&rsquo;s neighborhoods. Most likely the assailants left the ghetto for a suburban scene and invaded the victim&rsquo;s homes. My point, White women should be on guard any time they see a &#8220;questionable&#8221; character. </p>
<p>I used to deliver water in a majority-black area of Cleveland, Ohio. Since I stick out like a sore thumb over there, I had to play a psychological game with the people around me. The elderly blacks didn&rsquo;t seem to stare me down. The younger ones, especially in groups, wanted to rip me out of the truck and do me some bodily harm. I remember the LA riots and I sure wasn&rsquo;t going to let them attack me like they did Reginald Denny. Now I have a CCW 13 years later, just in case I am in an unfortunate situation again. The police officer who held the class said that if you shoot someone you will go to jail, but it&rsquo;s better than a visit to the mortician. Then leave it up to a lawyer &amp; a judge/ jury for the rest.</p>

		<p> Various elements of the news media quit identifying people by race (especially in crime-related stories) because of pressure by the NAACP and others of their ilk. Why? Because mentioning race in crime stories made it glaringly clear how heavily over-represented blacks were among the perpetrators. The truth hurts, and professionally aggrieved blacks didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p> As usual, the powers-that-be caved in to thinly-veiled threats of possible violence (&#8220;Dey gonna be a long, hot summah!&#8221;) and accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; if they didn&rsquo;t do what the black &#8220;leaders&#8221; wanted.</p>

Charlotte, and Chicago</p>
<p><i>As reported by Reuters in a survey done by an industry group organized crime is on the rise&hellip; According to the survey: Of 129 retailers, primarily national store chains, surveyed this spring by the National Retail Federation, 94.5 percent said they were victimized by organized criminals in the past year.</i></p>

<p><i>Three state troopers responded&hellip; to the first report of a fight. When they arrived, they were confronted by about 1,000 people&hellip;The groups have been larger and rowdier than even veteran South Boston troopers remember.</i></p>
<p>How soon before these &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; turn into full scale, multi-city riots that the police WILL NOT be able to contain?</p>
<p><i>Black males, who already had the highest unemployment rate of any ethnic/gender category, saw their joblessness rise from an astounding 17 percent last month to 17.5 percent this month. This is the largest increase of any group.</i></p>
<p>The following is from a financial newsletter and is entitled <i>Signs To Watch For</i></p>
<p>*automobiles with their gas caps pried off due to gas thefts.</p>
<p>*in high income areas, fast food restaurants that no longer make napkins, straws and condiments openly available because so much is stolen.</p>
<p>*steel bars on windows of homes and businesses in high income areas.</p>
<p>*no women pedestrians on the street during daytime.</p>
<p>*police patrolling in groups of three or more</p>
<p><i>Most important is the number of police patrolling together.  A single officer per car is good.  Four per car means they are expecting life-threatening violence.</i></p>

		<p>The race of the flash mobbers makes a lot of difference to them.  Therefore, it should be important to the rest of us.</p>
<p>Chapman is being disingenuous in making the parallel to religion.  The religion of the flash mobbers is irrelevant because it makes no difference what religion you are to be in a flash mob.  On the other hand, would the flash mobbers permit someone of another race to join them?</p>
<p>In this instance, race is relevant and religion is not.  We can conceive of other instances where religion is relevant and race is not.  For example, joining a church.  There are yet other examples where both race and religion are relevant.  For example, joining Al-Qaeda.  In those instances, we would expect both race and religion to mentioned as relevant details.</p>
<p>Chapman is suggesting that race is as irrevelant to the flash mob story as whether the flash mobbers are left or right handed.  Clearly, race is relevant here.</p>

		<p>This is one of the pernicious &#8220;new-speak&#8221; aspects of PC. One does not mention race because race is a mere social construct. The exception to this rule is that inherently racist whites must be humiliated and punished for existing. Hmmm, is there are a logical conflict there? Of course, but PC/Cultural Marxism/Liberalism is a delusional disorder, facts, figures and scientific data are irrelevant. </p>

<p>No, my question to YOU, Mr. Chapman, is why do YOU care so much about their race?  Why is this matter important to YOU?  If race were truly irrelevant, then it would not matter at all   &mdash;    either to us OR TO YOU.   But by the fact that you do not want us to discuss it or even think about it, it is obvious that it IS very important to you and you want to hush it up. THAT is the interesting question as to WHY?</p>

		<p>&#8220;My question to reporters and editors, why is gender considered relevant when reporting a crime? Why is gender considered useful information in identifying a suspect but race is not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly what I wanted to say.  As a small woman, I gague any possible threat by age, sex, &amp; race w/o even thinking about it.  Little old white lady: low threat.  Huge young black male: high threat.  Crowd of black folks, however calm: Find the Exit Now.</p>

		<p>How can we NOT care about race when blacks are reposible for a just about all of the riots and flash mob activities this summer.  Of course, incidentally, they only commit about 65% of all of the violent crime in this country as according to the FBI; but naturally liberals who always imagine racial utopias don&rsquo;t want to face these realities.  Anyone who has to deal with blacks on a daily basis know they are disruptive, dangerous, take absolutely no reponsibility for their actions, generally  hate whites, and have no respect for people, property, and institutions.</p>

		<p>The last thing that Whites need to do is to begin retaliating in kind on just any Blacks. That makes us just like them in the eyes of the Left.<br>
What needs to happen is the demise of those who attack Whites who ideally will be prepared to defend themseves mentally and materially or should I say &#8220;materiel&#8221;. If Blacks launch an unprovoked attack against what they perceive to be &#8220;unsuspecting&#8221; Whites and some or all of them have their cards punched by their intended prey, that is a good thing.<br>
 Once the White emerges as a difficult and dangerous prey they will be left alone.</p>

		<p>For too long the news media have conveyed the illusion that blacks are the same as whites, only less fortunate. Whites who are fortunate enough to have little contact with blacks seem usually to believe this, even when they are conservative on many other issues. <br>
        <br>
The news media have the responsibility to dispel this illusion by reporting the truth about black crime, black illegitimacy, and the brutal fact that most blacks are quite a bit less intelligent than most whites. <br>
     <br>
These differences are not the result of white racism. White racism is the result of these differences. These differences are biological. They will endure. </p>

		<p>Blacks and white liberals complain about commentators using code words and &#8220;dog-whistling&#8221;, yet they approve the habit of the MSM of not mentioning race if the suspect is black.  So, naturally, readers rightly assume that the suspect is black.  The lack of mentioning race has thus become code talk and is often used even when police are searching for someone still at large.  If a news account somehow failed to mention that a suspect is white (not likely, but it COULD happen!) then everyone would think the bad guy is black.</p>

<p>Great point.  They&rsquo;re the ones that largely censor racial ID in MSM articles, forcing us to play mental gymnastics, usually involving names and neighborhoods.  However, this reverse dog whistling isn&rsquo;t always perfect.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a story was popular in our little niche of the internet.  Someone found a receipt from a supermarket in Michigan showing someone used a SNAP Card (&#8220;food stamps&#8221;) to buy lobster and porterhouse steak.  Obviously, we all assumed black.</p>
<p>But the story&rsquo;s publicity caused so many flies on the wall to start paying attention that the person who purchased all these items was caught hawking them for 50 cents on the dollar.  And it&rsquo;s not who or what you think   &mdash;   Turns out it appears to be one of those &#8220;30 is the new 40&#8221; meth addicts:</p>

		<p>The subtle, yet screamingly obvious, Orwellian doublethink and doublespeak. He openly calls people, who care to know the race; in order to be on their guards ( hence the whites are victims of blacks &amp; the govern-media); &#8220;prejudiced&#8221; if you &#8220;fear or dislike blacks&#8221;. &#8216;Wagging the finger&rsquo;, so to speak, at any who dare to disagree with him. &#8220;In the attack courage what difference does race make, unless police are trying to get tips from eye witnesses&#8221; this is what should be happening, buy articles like this put political pressure on police investigations, the author (&#8220;forgetting&#8221; that there are still flash mob suspects at large) feels like the race of the ones already apprehended should not be discussed - but that is because they are black. Does he expect sheeple sleep-readers to believe that the race of a white criminal with a black victim, would not be &#8220;harped on&#8221;? Remember when that white guy donned black latex masks to rob convenience stores? The black the cops arrested, immediately became a victim of the white criminal. Race was &#8220;harped on&#8221; because it fit the narrative. : the perp was white.</p>

Or for any of the other holy relics or current items on the agenda of the civil rights movement focus on race? There are textbooks children read right there in chicago that &#8216;ignorantly&rsquo; focus on race. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll lead the way having these ignorant textbooks changed, because the race of those involved shouldn&rsquo;t matter. The time is now for a brave columnist like her to not just take a stand but continue to make a stand&hellip; . </p>

		<p>I suppose Chapman&rsquo;s other articles trumpet such questions as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do people always dwell on the religion of those 911 Hijackers?  How could their religion be relevant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is there so much focus on the religion of those Texas Polygamists whose children are being taken away from them?  How could religion have anything to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, when reporting on the Sarin Gas Attacks in Tokyo&rsquo;s Subway Lines, was it necessary to repeatedly mention the Aum Shinrikyo Religion?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if members of the Mt. Zion African Temple of Barbecued Ribs were to begin mounting concerted robbery/assault attacks&hellip;repeatedly&hellip;then it would, indeed, be relevant to mention the religion (and the specific denomination) of the attackers.</p>
<p>And while the race or religion of someone relaying his FEELINGS about weather might be less than relevant (and hardly equivalent to the race of the Perpetrators of a crime), the ORIGINS of noteworthy weather ARE entirely relevant.  As a case in point, I can remember a storm from Africa, which dumped red dust on us in Mississippi.  I suppose Chapman would have lamented, &#8220;Far too many people can&rsquo;t let go of the fact that the Red Dust Storm had its origins in Africa!  Why does it matter where that dust came from?  Can&rsquo;t we all just get along?&#8221;</p>
<p>But back to reporting on the race of people reporting their FEELINGS about Weather:  Chapman may not be aware of this, but some people have Seasonal Affective Disorder.  Some people have Reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder.  It would not be irrelevant to note that people of certain ethnicities were racing about, euphoric, in sub-zero cold; a follow-up to an article on who was all happy-happy, during that summer&rsquo;s triple-digit heatwave.</p>
<p>So no, it is not necessarily irrelevant or ridiculous to report that a black man says he loves today&rsquo;s weather.</p>

<p>Prejudice means to judge before we have all the facts.  The facts are that most of the violent crimes, especially interracial, are black on white.  Therefore, &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; is not the right word to use.  Then again, this is typical of blacks and white liberals.

		<p>Steve Chapman&rsquo;s comment&rsquo;s were not only intelligent, but as a professional, he was following the rules of journalism. You don&rsquo;t mention race unless it is important to the story. He is right. Mentioning they are black isn&rsquo;t enough as this would cover a great many people. If they were of a particular street gang, wearing gang jackets, it may be different. Some posters were too ignorant to get the point. If you are a victim of a white rapist, white serial killer or white pedophile, you wouldn&rsquo;t give a damn about statistics having to do with races. (to the idiot who called you an idiot).

In Columbine and recently when the astronauts wife was shot in the head, and many other shootings, the gunman was white. So  should whites  be leery of all white people, or should they note any strange behavior (like heavy coat in summer concealing guns) from anyone no matter what their race?

Bishop Fulton J.Sheen is long gone and-with few exceptions-the churches (including Fundamentalists) have been captured by neo-Marxist ideology.  99% of churches give primacy to the same stew of multiculturalism, &#8220;inclusion&#8221;, Diversity, Political Correctness, white guilt, pro-minority racialism, anti-white identity, etc, etc. A few are slightly behind on the curve on full-blown radical feminism and LGBT &#8220;rights.&#8221; And then there the black churches(like Rev.

		<p>I am a Chicago resident. I have read nany columns by this Steve Chapman. What he is saying here is typical of the level of thought that he provides. Here are two cases that stick out:A)In demanding amnesty for illegals,he said Americans should be PROUD that immigrants want to come here;it shows we got a good country. We should be proud?? B) He said,in a recent column re the release of prisoners in California,that its a great idea,because sooo many of the prisoners are NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS! So if one gangbanger is caught invading a home,and his best friend is caught committing agg battery,why heh heh heh the FIRST guy should be released.He&rsquo;s non-violent!He&rsquo;s a sweetie! It doesnt matter how many violent crimes he HAS committed or WILL commit;he just got caught doing a NON-VIOLENT crime&hellip;so he&rsquo;s OK!!Chapaman is surely an idiot;and they label him as the &#8220;conservative&#8221;! HA! </p>

		<p>Anonymous comment #75 bringsup an important point.  </p>
<p>The overwhelming argument, posted here, in favor of pointing out the race of a perp is that somehow we will be able to protect ourselves from violence - as comment #20 points out &#8220;And yes Steve, it WOULD be a good idea to run away if one sees more than two or three blacks walking towards them.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I am to understand this correctly, I need to avoid race &#8220;x&#8221; because they are more inclined to commit crime  &#8220;y&#8221;</p>
<p>If this is true, can someone tell me which race I should not run away from?</p>

&#8220;Someone left out the stats that you are more likely to get raped by your own race than another. Whites do get raped by whites,so it would be best to cut the racist crap and just to be cautious, period. In Columbine and recently when the astronauts wife was shot in the head, and many other shootings, the gunman was white. So should whites be leery of all white people, or should they note any strange behavior (like heavy coat in summer concealing guns) from anyone no matter what their race? Are you going to let a white gunman near you, or be alone with a strange white male thinking, &ldquo;He is white, so he must be okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your stats must be from Mars. The cases you cite are a rarity compared with the multiple attacks on White by Blacks every day in cities and towns across this country. You need to do a a lot more research.<br>
No one is saying that Whites don&rsquo;t commit crime but Blacks have little to fear regarding attacks by Whites. Whites in the majority want to have as little contact as possible with Blacks because any contact with them too often results in dangerous and or fatal consequences for the White person.<br>
BTW stop using that silly word &#8220;racist&#8221;. Try something original. At the very least it would be a novel stupidity.<br>

&#8220;I just read a story on Fox News this morning about a cop that shot an unarmed man and is now getting out of prison. The first sentence in that story states &ldquo;a white cop&hellip;black unarmed man. Why is race important in this story and not the flash mob stories? I used to like Fox. Not anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p> I wonder when the serious rioting will begin in the Bay Area. BTW I watch FOX only because of the beautiful ladies.</p>

		<p>Chapman may be a moron, but having worked for newspapers, I can tell you he is the norm. Newspapers do NOT want to identify the race of perps for fear of being called racist. And it&rsquo;s not only major newspapers – even medium and smaller newspapers largely do not identify the race of criminals if they&rsquo;re not white. Reporters who want to tell the truth, and include the race of criminals in their stories, have them cut out on the desk. It happened to me several times. At one newspaper where I worked, it got to the point where management was noting the size of pictures our photographers took of criminals at arraignments and where they were placed on the page. The desk was told not to put shots of minority criminals    &mdash;   and where I am, that&rsquo;s mostly Hispanic – at the top of the page and to not make them large. But it was okay to put white criminals at the top of the page. It&rsquo;s absurd, it&rsquo;s asinine, it&rsquo;s racist, but it&rsquo;s the way it is.  It&rsquo;s also one of the reasons the newspaper industry is in trouble. Readers know what&rsquo;s being withheld. If you read a story reporting &ldquo;a man in his &lsquo;30s, six feet, two inches tall, wearing a black sweat shirt and blue jeans pulled a gun on a clerk at the convenience store and got away with an undetermined amount of cash,&rdquo; you know the perp is a minority. If he&rsquo;s white, the story reads, &ldquo;a white man in his &lsquo;30s&hellip;.&rdquo; Yes, Chapman is all the things above posters have called him. But he&rsquo;s also the guy in charge at your local newspaper. This is the kind of stupidity we&rsquo;re up against.</p>

		<p>I live in Berkeley, Ca. which is sandwiched between two cities with humongous nasty black populations, Oakland and Richmond. Plus, Berkeley has it&rsquo;s own black nasties.</p>
<p>l live in South Berkeley in a neighborhood that is almost completely white, but the neighborhood isn&rsquo;t safe because of black criminals. Black criminals that probably wouldn&rsquo;t set foot in this neighborhood if racial integration didn&rsquo;t allow them to wander anywhere they wish.</p>
<p>The same situation holds in other neighborhoods in Berkeley, and I assume, in other neighborhoods throughout the country where there are large black populations close by.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why do you care so much about the attackers&rsquo; race?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because:</p>
<p>1. The media rarely reports that DOJ statistics show that blacks commit violent crimes at a rate that is a multiple of the corresponding white rate. We want people to understand this fact as part of an understanding that integration isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>2. In many white neighborhoods such as the one I live in, the violent crimes are committed virtually exclusively by blacks. Some whites are still naive about this, and we want them to be appropriately wary when they see blacks in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>3. The more that media mentions race, the more that white people will feel that it&rsquo;s permitted to think and talk about race.</p>
<p>The real question, Mr. Chapman, is why people like yourself insist that race NOT be mentioned. That&rsquo;s the pathology that needs to be publicly dissected in full view of us all.</p>

		<p>Race is important as an identifier. To simplify matters and put them into context, lets wander a little afield.<br>
Say there is a news report of a group of dogs attacking people on the streets. Now since there is no mention of the color or breed (race?) of dogs, you might be excused for being concerned when approached by a group of miniature poodles. But then you find out the attackers were pit bull terriers. Now you have cause to be seriously concerned when approached by a pair or larger group of unleashed put bulls. This is not to say that ALL pit bulls are vicious, or will attack. I&rsquo;ve known lovely, well-mannered pit bulls. It also is not to say that no miniature poodles, spaniels or corgis will ever attack. It just says that there is a reason for using a lot more caution when you and your children are around pit bulls than when around only miniature poodles. <br>
IT WORKS EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WITH PEOPLE. <br>
I&rsquo;ve known some lovely, well-mannered black people, but since they have a racial history of attacking whites with little or no provocation, it&rsquo;s best to be cautious and avoid them when possible. Yes, race matters  &mdash;  a lot.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I scanned through the articles posted on AmRen since May 31st and found approximately 15 of them deal with violent black mobs &ldquo;wilding&rdquo;, fighting, wreaking havoc and, especially attacking, beating and robbing Whites  &mdash;  in Myrtle Beach, Miami Beach, Nashville, Boston. Charlotte, and Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Impossible.  Myrtle Beach, Nashville and Charlotte are in the South and we all know that blacks never attack whites in the South because everyone in the South carries a gun.  </p>

<p><br>
ATBOTL is right.  <br>
But if it were to happen (let&rsquo;s just suppose), I wonder what would become of those staunch gun-toters if they were surrounded by a group of blacks and were grabbed by several  from behind.  Hmmm?  Whose gun would it be then?</p>
<p>And what makes you think that none of them would be armed?<br>
Moral: No gun is going to save you from a mob.</p>

		<p><em>If a pedestrian gets run over by a bicyclist, should the story mention that the rider was white?</em></p>
<p>Yes, especially if it was a hit and run incident, or it looks as though the pedestrian could have been targetted for reasons of robbery or possible racial animus.</p>
<p><em>My question to readers accusing us of political correctness is: Why do you care so much about the attackers&rsquo; race?</em></p>
<p>You answer a question (well, deflect attention from the question) with another question? What are you, a politician or a journalist? </p>
<p>I suppose what is really more interesting is not the answer to the question (most people who can think for themselves already know the answer), rather, the real interest is in why the so-called mainstream media go to such ridiculous lengths to mislead, misdirect and distort reality to fulfil an obviously political agenda. The media is no more to be trusted than former Soviet propaganda outlets.</p>
<p>What I find really grating is the naked class snobbery implicit in all of this. I also despise people who prostitute their position to pay lip-service to something they know to be false, but would like to believe to be true.</p>
<p><em>If you fear or dislike blacks, I suppose it would confirm your prejudice.</em></p>
<p>You deflect attention from an issue of genuine concern about your own journalistic integrity with a supposition.</p>
<p><em>But otherwise, it tells you nothing useful.</em></p>
<p>Would that assertion not be better made with at least an attempt to address the question?</p>
<p>People allege &#8216;political correctness&rsquo;, not out of prejudice (<em> a priori</em> assumptions unsubstantiated by evidence), but more due to the fact that the media will tend to suppress acknowedgement of race or ethnic background when it involves minorities, but are always willing to castigate and villify whites who can be projected as possible haters and bigots. I draw your attention to the Duke University debacle and the judicious editing of the Rodney King video, to name but two instances in living memory.</p>
<p>If there is a question of &#8216;fear&rsquo;, then I suspect that the fear resides with the media, who are frightened of &#8216;antagonising&rsquo; minority communities and other grievance and special-privilege groups.</p>
<p>Journalists seem to enjoy a smug sense of moral superiority, while they are able to avoid the vibrant diversity they routinely preach to the rest of us. This is naked class one-up-manship; ie it is a form of snobbery.</p>
<p>If only you really knew what minorities think of white people &hellip; To do that, however, you would need to live your life among them, which is something I doubt very much that you do.</p>
