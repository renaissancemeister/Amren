	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s faith adviser, Eboo Patel, declared that what Obama learned from his days at Chicago&rsquo;s controversial Trinity United Church will &#8220;help America.&#8221;</p>
<p>For more than 20 years, Obama attended Trinity church led by Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who is notorious for his statements against the U.S. and white people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WND also reported Patel blasted what he called the &#8220;myths&#8221; of America - describing them as beliefs that the country is &#8220;a land of freedom and equality and justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not a linguist, so perhaps another poster can help me. If this man is filled with &#8220;rage&#8221; would you say that emotion is closer semantically to &#8220;love&#8221; or &#8220;anger&#8221;? </p>
<p>Am I to take him at his word, that he is filled with a love-based rage at the United States?</p>

WND Exclusive<br>
What Obama learned from Rev. Wright will &#8216;help&rsquo; U.S.?<br>
President&rsquo;s faith adviser hails controversial Trinity church<br>

<p>Sen. Barack Obama with Rev. Jeremiah Wright</p>
<p>President Obama&rsquo;s faith adviser, Eboo Patel, declared that what Obama learned from his days at Chicago&rsquo;s controversial Trinity United Church will &#8220;help America.&#8221;</p>
<p>For more than 20 years, Obama attended Trinity church led by Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who is notorious for his statements against the U.S. and white people.</p>
<p>Trinity&rsquo;s own literature routinely attacked the U.S. government while decrying patriotism.</p>
<p>Such an attitude is not foreign to Patel. WND reported Patel declared that everything he was taught about Christopher Columbus, Thomas Jefferson and American &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;equality&#8221; was wrong.</p>
<p>WND also reported Patel blasted what he called the &#8220;myths&#8221; of America – describing them as beliefs that the country is &#8220;a land of freedom and equality and justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patel has talked about &#8220;rage&#8221; he felt against the U.S. after claiming to experience prejudice in the country.</p>
<p>Patel stated the faith movement gave him a &#8220;way to have a radical view of the world – radical equality, radical peace, radical possibility – that is love-based, not anger-based.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wrote that had he been around in the 1960s, he may have joined Bill Ayers&rsquo; anti-American Weatherman terrorist group, as WND reported.</p>
<p>(Story continues below)</p>
<p>	 		 </p>
<p>In February 2010, Obama named Patel to his Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.</p>
<p>Patel, a Muslim activist, is the founder and executive director of Chicago-based Interfaith Youth Core, which says it promotes pluralism by teaming people of different faiths on service projects</p>

<p>What a joke! Patel, a muslim activist, just like Obama&hellip;.goes to show who and what Obama is, doesn&rsquo;t it?  I sure bet Patel has many &#8220;Christians&#8221; in his Interfaith Youth Core, RIGHT? <br>

		<p>Whatever you may think of them personally for betraying their country in a time of war, The Weatherman group were largely peaceful, attacking empty offices with the exception of the Days Of Rage event with the blown up statue which was basically a case of overkill causing massive secondary damage from shrapnel and broken windows.  For their arrogance, they took significant attrition to stupidity and accident and were driven underground for something like 15 years, where they were largely forgotten and lost all power, wasting their lives on the run.</p>
<p>If this is the kind of action and outcome Patel would endorse, he should realize he sounds like a child, assigning the value of hate and rebellion to a fad-label group which he doesn&rsquo;t understand in detail.</p>
<p>Indeed, the two events most commonly associated with the pale-as-snow Weatherman group and the Black Civil Rights radicalists (Days of Rage and the San Francisco Police Station Bombing) saw the former sever all relations with the Black Panthers and Black Liberation Army, respectively.</p>
<p>If you have something to say.  Say it.  Don&rsquo;t try to ride someone else&rsquo; coat tails.  If only because you end up subject to the vagaries of opinion on those identity groups which you name solely to fan the flames of controversy.</p>
<p>We know who Reverend Wright is because he&rsquo;s a crazed fool who is too old to hold the bigoted opinions he does as a legitimate conceit of &#8216;youthful exuberance&rsquo;.  Most contemporary Americans don&rsquo;t know who the Weatherman group even are and wouldn&rsquo;t care if they do because they are clearly effete 60&rsquo;s generation snobs playing the academic system for all the speaking engagements they can get.</p>
<p>Neither of which tired revolutionarism reflects well on Patel&rsquo;s own &#8216;revolutionary ideals&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>And where did BO find THIS bozo - in the same pile of refuse from which he discovered &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright?  Sounds pretty similar to me!  And - hmmmm - did said bozo bother to say exactly HOW BO&rsquo;s experience of sleeping through &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright&rsquo;s &#8220;sermons&#8221; is going to help America?  I mean, BO said he had no idea what Wright and his church stood for - so how is that gonna help us???</p>

		<p>&#8220;Patel has talked about &ldquo;rage&rdquo; he felt against the U.S. after claiming to experience prejudice in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>  I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that, at best, Mr. Patel is a first generation South Asian American. Any yet, he is filled with &#8220;rage&#8221; against this country, and I assume whites in particular. The extended &#8220;Patel&#8221; family owns many of the cheaper budget motels throughout the United States  &mdash;  Super 8 seeming to be a favorite. It never fails to amaze me at the ingratitude and hostility of some of our post-1965 Third World immigrants toward the people who welcomed them into their country.  I&rsquo;ve hardly ever heard any magnanimous comments toward Americans, or whites especially from these &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; recent arrivals. </p>

I was listening to a local black talk show and they were discussing &#8216;black issue&rsquo;; poor school performance, violence, etc.</p>
<p>The guest injected an off the cuff remark to the effect that &#8216;let&rsquo;s face it, the people who founded this country were all criminals&rsquo;. The host agreed.</p>
<p>This was a discussion on &#8216;black issues&rsquo; mind you. Out of nowhere, the guest blames current black pathology on alleged crimes of Founding Fathers over 200 years ago.</p>
<p>Black can never solve their problems (for multiple reasons) only ONE of which is their inability to see themselves as the problem.<br>

&#8216;It&rsquo;s not us, it&rsquo;s them&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>Does Mr. Patel feel rage about his chosen religion&rsquo;s oppression of women? Or the inequities in his native India?</p>
<p>Or does he save his rage and hatred for just America?</p>

		<p>America is such an evil hateful racist society. I cannot figure out why so many people want to immigrate here? You would think all of the racism would keep away the millions of non-whites trying to move here?</p>

<p>&#8220;[Eboo] wrote that had he been around in the 1960s, he may have joined Bill Ayers&rsquo; anti-American Weatherman terrorist group, as WND reported.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Not widely known among Bill Ayers&rsquo; writings   &mdash;   which he has NEVER renounced or regretted in any way   &mdash;   was that his vision of a &#8220;New Improved Communized USA&#8221; required the extermination of the most conservative of America&rsquo;s white population. </p>
<p>Ayers estimated that such (generally older, more rural, more &#8220;right-wing&#8221;) whites constituted some 25 million people. Ayers and Dohrn and the Weathermen were committed, therefore, to an American Holocaust that would kill several times as many victims as the Nazi Holocaust. </p>
<p>Yet NOT ONE &#8220;journalist&#8221; from the MSM will EVER ask Eboo if his dedication to Ayers&rsquo; Weathermen would have meant Eboo&rsquo;s participating in the rounding up and exterminating of TENS OF MILLIONS of whites that his bomb-tossing idol Ayers had publicly called for. </p>
<p>Although if any reporter ever DID put Eboo on the spot and demand an answer to this   &mdash;   and if Eboo were to reply honestly and without equivocation   &mdash;   I suspect we can all guess what his answer would be: you, me, our families, and everybody else reading this site, would be among the first executed. </p>
<p>And this is the man that our &#8220;President&#8221; chooses as his &#8220;Spiritual Advisor.&#8221; </p>
