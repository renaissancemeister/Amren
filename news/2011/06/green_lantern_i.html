			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gloria Goodale, Christian Science Monitor, June 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>But, as movies continue to mine classic comic books, some critics suggest they are going retro in more ways than one, returning to the genre&rsquo;s early weak spots: a lack of diversity and an overwhelming emphasis on white American male power fantasies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hollywood often continues to use a white American male as its default lead character and assumes that viewers of all demographics will be able to identify with him,&#8221; says Amy Corbin, assistant professor of art and film studies at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Penn.</p>
<p>The white male becomes the &#8220;universal&#8221; character who is supposedly compelling for everyone  &mdash;  while when women and people of color play the leads, those films are often assumed to be &#8220;niche&#8221; films that will only attract a viewing demographic that matches the lead character,&#8221; she adds via email.</p>
<p>{snip} In the Green Lantern mythology, the latest wearer of the ring of power is chosen by the ring itself, specifically for the wearer&rsquo;s strength of will and ability to overcome fear.</p>
<p>The ring is looking for &#8220;the best of the best,&#8221; says Mr. Chambliss, adding: &#8220;You&rsquo;re telling me that in 2011, on a planet of some 7 billion people, the vast majority of whom are minority faces, that the best of the best is going to be a white guy from southern California?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This sends a troubling message, he says adding &#8220;there are many other figures they could have chosen to make a movie about, but this one is appealing much more strongly to the privileging of white, male American power than many others.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the last time. If these people want more non-white superheroes, let them create the characters, publish the comics, and write the movie scripts.</p>
<p>These people are nothing but lazy. They want the white man to do all the creative work and then they want the white man to transfer his hard work to them.<br>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t bought Paul Kersey&rsquo;s book yet on Hollywood, you need too. You&rsquo;ll understand what is going on with the replacement of white actors in heroic roles and why these type of articles are tolerated. </p>
<p>In the cartoon &#8220;Justice League&#8221; (made in 2001) they replaced the white Green Lantern with a Black one so they could achieve a racial balance where it isn&rsquo;t only white guys saving the world. </p>

<p>Oh, now <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a world-renowned authority on movie-making.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The ring is looking for &ldquo;the best of the best,&rdquo; says Mr. Chambliss, adding: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that in 2011, on a planet of some 7 billion people, the vast majority of whom are minority faces, that the best of the best is going to be a white guy from southern California?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Apparently the very concept of a White man being best at anything is anathema to &#8220;Mr. Chambliss.&#8221;  Why are you such a racist, Mr. Chambliss?  It seems there <i>is</i> such a thing as race, after all.</p>
<p><i>&#8221; &ldquo;there are many other figures they could have chosen to make a movie about&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>You mean like the black Norse god Heimdall in the recent <i>Thor</i> film?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This sends a troubling message, he says&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Good.  When I see the film this coming Tuesday, I&rsquo;ll enjoy it all the more, knowing that Amy Corbin and Mr. Chambliss are so deeply &#8220;troubled&#8221; by it.<br>

		<p>Well Ms. Corbin let&rsquo;s look at the facts. As far as power fantasies are concerned. It started with the weapons of war like the catapult and the fire thrower. Our use of grenades and the application of gun powder that we perfected from the Chinese had a great deal to do with it. </p>
<p>Then we mastered cannons, rifles, pistols and all manner of rocket launchers, tanks, air and sea warfare with metal ships over 1,000 feet long. Power fantasies come naturally to us we live and expedite through our dreams in a way which no other race has ever been able to match or conquer. </p>
<p>We defeated the Indians with technology and blacks can&rsquo;t create anything except more illegitimate babies any movie that shows a person of color in a position of high intelligence or integrity is a lie. Think Morgan Freeman as God or the President ol Morg is stooping his niece who&rsquo;s 1/3 his age. </p>
<p>Methinks the ring belongs where it is so take your frustrated diversity mongering and go take a flying leap. </p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t tell me this man is paid a salary to sit around and ponder existential questions about the probability of who a green alien race with a ring of power bestows that said power unto.  This man understands that this is a comic book fantasy, right?  I&rsquo;m not convinced.</p>
<p>The real reason that Mr. Chambliss and his ilk are upset is that they are against any media that portrays a straight white male as being anything other than an evil oppressor.  <br>

		<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t we assume that the best of the best is a white guy?  HE IS.  And since whites are still the majority ethnicity in the U.S., films with non-white leads ARE niche films.  So there.</p>

		<p>Both the Spiderman and Superman blockbuster series were conceived and produced by a middle-aged woman named Laura Ziskin.</p>
<p>Her job as producer was to make money for the studio and provide employment for the industry.  She went for movies that would make money, not movies that reflected her own viewing preference or political beliefs.</p>
<p>When will the idiot intellectuals learn that movies and TV are a business and our priority is to produce something that people will buy, just as toy, car and electronics manufactures have to produce something that people will buy.</p>
<p>Laura was a feminine feminist.  She took advantage of the feminist movement to get her first jobs.  She was actually a feminine girly woman.  She didn&rsquo;t produce Spiderman and Superman because she had the movie preference of teen age boys.</p>
<p>She produced them to make money and provide employment for thousands of people.</p>

		<p>Rollins College History Professor Julian Chambliss, who is a comic book expert (hard to make things up these days), and who we learn through an internet search is also black, asks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me that in 2011, on a planet of some 7 billion people, the vast majority of whom are minority faces, that the best of the best is going to be a white guy from southern California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, &lsquo;the vast majority are minority&rsquo; Professor Chambliss, it is not me. It is none other than the Ring of Power that selects the &lsquo;best of the best&rsquo;. You can read all about it in the Green Lantern comic book. I am merely a mortal who notices differences between demographic groups in test scores, crime rates, and performance in the workplace. I have opinions about how these differences should be incorporated into public policy, including my support of merit-based selection processes for academia. If it helps with your self-esteem, it has been rumored that the Ring of Power selected Yoda as the runner up.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what. In my youth I was a big aficionado of comic books, so let&rsquo;s play a game. Here are some of the most influential artists in the history of the form:</p>
<p>Basil Wolverton<br>
Chester Gould<br>
Robert Crumb<br>
Harvey Kurtzman <br>
Stan Lee <br>
Bob Kane</p>
<p>And I could go on and on. All of these men have something in common, and it ain&rsquo;t that they&rsquo;re left-handed. I wish that Miss Goodale could get a wish and an answer to her hypothetical question. Imagine a Twilight Zone-styled hypothetical where we all woke up tomorrow and there were no white men. Let&rsquo;s say we went without their input for a month. All of the champions of diversity, all of the professors of African Studies, the columnists who like to editorialize about white privilege could try to get through the month without any white man- or brain power. It certainly would be interesting. Demographic trends say it will be a reality in a matter of a few decades, and to this white man it is almost worth it to face extinction just to see the spider finally caught in its own web. Enjoy the world without us, and good luck trying to keep the lights on.</p>

<p>Um, excuse me.  Those white guys who make the movies are probably NOT thinking this, because they&rsquo;re all liberal democrats!  They are making movies that reflect themselves.  </p>
<p>&#8220;while when women and people of color play the leads, those films are often assumed to be &ldquo;niche&rdquo; films that will only attract a viewing demographic that matches the lead character&#8221;</p>
<p>Um, isn&rsquo;t this contradictory?  You say that the movies with white heroes are assuming that everyone identifies with the white characters, a point you strongly challenge, but then when a film has a woman lead or a minority, you label it a niche film yourself, putting it in quotes to make it seem belitted?</p>
<p>Basically, the authors are angry that ANY films have white males as the leads.  You cannot deny this subtext.</p>

<p>So I Googled, &#8220;julian chambliss, rollins college&#8221;, and - lo and behold - on the screen pops a nerdy black guy with lots of obvious self-esteem issues. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet from a site called Academia.edu :</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Chambliss teaches race and ethnicity, urban history, city planning history, African-American history, and popular history courses. In addition to traditional pedagogy Dr. Chambliss has directed several service learning projects using oral history interviews to explore municipal development, housing, gentrification, and race.&#8221; </p>
<p>Then we have this telling little gem from a former student of his at RateMyProfessors.com :</p>
<p>&#8220;Chabliss is ok. Hes a little immature and unclear at times because he tries to sound smart. This class was relatively easy though he can be picky over random stuff. Dont feel bad if u answer a question and he acts like it isnt right. hell restate ur answer as if ur was wrong. Be careful wut class you take, hes getting pickier and doing dumber stuff&#8221;</p>
<p>Judging by his comments to the CSM, his photograph and what his former students are saying about him and his academic profile, I&rsquo;d say we have the makings of someone who benefited hugely from Affirmative Action policies, was probably a mediocre student himself who attended Shade Tree institutions. Above all else, this Julian Chambliss cannot accept the perpetual, self-inflicted problems of his own black community and must find a White scapegoat behind every bush and under every rock, even it it is a fictional comic book character.</p>
<p>Pathetic!!! </p>

		<p>Geez, wasn&rsquo;t the Green Lantern from the comic books a white male?( I think White MAN sounds better  &mdash;  -&#8220;male&#8221; sounds like something not quite fully developed) So what&rsquo;s the problem? Was Batman black? Or Superman? Apparently, one of the Norse gods was black, according to &#8220;Hollyweird&#8221;. Is the next iteration of Batman going to star a black actor? So I guess we can make a Black Panther movie with a white man since we have to start making all of the white superheroes black. Oops, what was I thinking? We must cater to and coddle only blacks and capitulate to them on every front. Silly me.</p>

<p>Huh?  How could even one person think this?  Almost -EVERYTIME-  I watch something turned out by Hollywood, the lead or alpha male is non-white&hellip;typically black.  </p>
<p>You know, the genius who thinks circles around dumfounded whites and of course, is the sexual desire of all the white women.</p>

<p>Uh, news flash: it&rsquo;s a fantasy flick. So it&rsquo;s okay for it to appeal to any other power fantasies, as long as it&rsquo;s not those of white American males?</p>

<p>Okay, where&rsquo;s this guy to point out that whites are a small minority of the world&rsquo;s population when everyone refers to nonwhites as the oppressed &#8220;minority?&#8221; He&rsquo;s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>This Chambliss has a thing about superheroes, by the way, as can be seen on his website:</p>

		<p>Oh Geez&hellip;.here we go again with another anti-white campaign&hellip;and to even believe it&rsquo;s an attack on a FICTIONAL character this time!!! How pathetic is this writer?</p>
<p>For your information Gloria Goodale, the Green Lantern character is a fictional character who is NOT real, and was created in July 1940 by DC Comics. And if you were any type of credible journalist, one would think you would do some basic research before you go off on a tirade believing the whole world (including comics) should be &ldquo;colorized&rdquo; or non-white.  In fact, Ms. Goodall, ALL comic book characters were WHITE back in the 40&rsquo;s, 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. Where were you back then, under a rock? I mean, who would&rsquo;ve ever believed that Batman or Spiderman could&rsquo;ve been black? Are you serious? </p>
<p>And BTW, I&rsquo;m a huge comic book nut and comics are loved by everyone regardless of race, sex, religion etc&hellip;.In fact, I&rsquo;ve never seen a black person ever question why Spiderman is not black. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen. Everyone accepts him for how the character was created&hellip;except for this nutjob writer apparently. I&rsquo;m so sick of hearing about RACE or &ldquo;color&rdquo; on every single little thing nowadays. We are all human, how about that? Different shades of skin color is just the result of one&rsquo;s percentage of melanin or lack there of.</p>

		<p>Open letter to Gloria Goodale</p>
<p>Listen, Will Smith played the lead in: </p>
<p>1.  Independence Day.  Played a plane flying military office who saves the world and gets the girl.  </p>
<p>2.  Hancock, a black super hero with fantastic powers.</p>
<p>3.  I am Robot, a black cop who saves the world from an evil white man and his army of robots, who also happened to be white. </p>
<p>4.  I am legend.  A genius doctor army officer who fights off zombies (all white) and creates a cure, saves the remainder of humanity and sacrafices himself to do so. </p>
<p>5.  Men in BLACK.  Where he is a government agent who saves the world and gets the beautiful white girl medical examiner (doctor) in the end. </p>
<p>These are all hit movies that millions of racist whites paid to see here in racist America.  Why does a white male hating pseudo intellectual like yourself have to point to the few remaining while male heroes left in the media&hellip; and cry foul?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you realize that there are a few white male children left in the world and they too like role models to look up to?  Would you really deny them that?  What about their self esteem?  </p>
<p>People who look like me need a hero to look up to.  Obama doesn&rsquo;t fit that bill.  Eric Holder doesn&rsquo;t fit that bill Neither does Colon Powell, Condolleezza Rice, the starting line of  the NBA, most of the NFL.</p>
<p>Ms. Goodale, please leave us white males a thread of self respect to cling to.  Please!     <br>

		<p>Personally, I go to the movies to be entertained.  Seeing characters other than whites in positions of power and intelligence is far fetched.  I avoid movies with too many black characters especially when they are used as hero type.  Why is it necessary even in entertainment, this fantasy about blacks being better than whites have to be forced upon the public?  All third world citizens pushed and shoved so as to be able to live in countries built by white brain power.  Why is that?  This question should be asked of the authors of this article.    </p>

<p>99.9% of all bad guys in movies are white males. Look at the Matrix. The bad guys are all white: Mr Smith, the other agents, the Architect, the Merovingian, the Twins, the Trainman, and the short weasel that betrays Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus in the first move. All the good people are minorities. Morpheus, Trinity (woman), Oracle (black woman), the Asian that protects the Oracle, the ship operators (Black/Hispanic).  </p>

<p>Oh, please. If white males are so lacking and out ranked why are all the non-whites trying to come to countries basically built by WHITE MALES?

<p>I think that, as ludicrous as this entire scenario is, if we were to try to identify a single individual who was the &#8220;best of the best&#8221; and fit to become a super-hero, he would probably hail from one of the world&rsquo;s successful societies. I mean, that&rsquo;s a reasonable assumption to make. </p>
<p>Would you expect to find the best of the best in Mexico or Ethiopia? If people from those places were so extraordinary, you&rsquo;d think their countries would reflect that.</p>
<p>I mean if you were looking for the most brilliant businessman, would you look at a place that had just gone bankrupt? If you were looking for an Olympic athlete, would check fat farms? </p>

<p>Not necessarily from So Cal, but if we go by the composition of the top top special forces, and today, looking at all those blue-eyed, tall, determined looking Russian faces during their WW2 Victory Day, I&rsquo;d say that it is obvious that the best of the best is going to come from the white male population somewhere.</p>

<p>Well, since white people are bland and have no culture, while the minorities are all unique and special (or at least that&rsquo;s what idiots like the people quoted in this article usually say), it makes sense to caste a white as a character that everyone can project themselves onto.

		<p>Here is a cautionary tale, sadly true, of a non-White super-hero who had cult status long before comic books. Readers will notice the many parallels with society today in the history of &#8216;The Birdman of Easter Island&rsquo;. In the cult of the birdman, a competition was established in which every year a representative of each clan, chosen by the leaders, would swim across shark-infested waters to Motu Nui, a nearby islet, to search for the season&rsquo;s first egg laid by a manutara (sooty tern). The first swimmer to return with an egg and successfully climb back up the cliff to Orongo would be &#8220;Birdman of the year&#8221; and secure control over distribution of the island&rsquo;s resources for his clan for the year. The tradition was still in existence at the time of first contact by Europeans and ended in 1867. The birdman system had devastating effects on the island&rsquo;s ecosystem. Because each winner held responsibility for only one year, he had little incentive to develop a policy that would be sustainable in the long run. Instead, it was common for the winner and his supporters to short-sightedly pillage the island after the victory. As the island was pushed closer and closer to ecological collapse, famine and disease became increasingly common and the population never recovered. The Birdman is no longer. Take care not to emulate this clannish system of government, local or national!</p>

		<p>Mr. Hirsch makes an important and highly relevant point. The creators of the the comic book media and the characters are white males. The major consumers of comic books are-white males. There is no requirement for these gentlemen to do anything other than create art that appeals to their audience. I have no interest in rap music or all black sitcoms. Chick flicks, like Sex in the City I give a pass to. Ms. Corbin isn&rsquo;t paying close attention to media today. The airways are well supplied non-white male images today.

		<p>Black characters good, white characters bad is a common scenario in many of Hollywood&rsquo;s current products.  But that is at odds with the FBI crime statistics.  Academia too leans toward the political PC scenario to the extent of defending the dignity of imaginary comic book characters, Ironically, those comic book characters were invented by white people.  And yet over the decades few black comic book authors have surfaced, despite exceeding low barriers-of-entry due to the Internet.  Discriminatory?  The Japanese and Chinese are avid authors and readers of their own cultural comics.  Hello?  Build and market your own successful product, rather than demand a ride on the coattails of whites.  Then again that has proven to be a successful strategy.</p>

<p>Hilarious.  Right.  God forbid the best of the best ever be a White male.  The story would be much more realistic if the aliens found the most suitable candidate in the bastion of innovation and creativity that is Africa.  And this sentence doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.  How can the <i>majority</i> of people on the plant be minority faces?  Isn&rsquo;t everyone on the planet a minority face?  Or are Whites just so overexposed that we don&rsquo;t count as minority (I think I&rsquo;m starting to get it)?</p>
<p>The Green Lantern was created by Whites at a time when the country was still overwhelmingly White, so you would think that race would be one of those aspects of the story that could be taken for granted.  But not by anti-White liberals like Mr. Chambliss and Ms. Corbin.  To them, race is a zero-sum game in which any work of art that reinforces the image of the White male as noble and heroic is repugnant and to be reviled.  It&rsquo;s bad enough that the classics are littered with the heroic deeds of White men; to create <i>new art</i> featuring White men in those same roles is insufferable.  </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read comics since my early twenties, but I appreciate those classic heroes even more now.  Periodic attempts were made to promote Black characters and give (previously) White heroes Black alter egos from the 70&rsquo;s onward, but it never worked!  They couldn&rsquo;t brainwash America&rsquo;s youth into choosing a Black hero over a White one, no matter how hard they tried.  All the most popular heroes are still White, because when choice is permitted (through purchasing decisions) people will usually select their own race.  Superman, Batman, the Green Lantern, Thor, Wolverine, ect., are symbols of White survival that  &mdash;  despite their silliness  &mdash;  should not be not be treated lightly. <br>

		<p>Good Lord.  I just cannot believe the insanity that passes for cultural commentary these days.  Chambliss&rsquo; madness can be expected.  After all, black mediocrity is always excused by racism, racism, racism.  Since birth black people absorb the message that evil whites have deprived them, dispossessed them, despoiled them, stolen their history, etc., ad nauseum.  Can we really expect anything different?  Pathetic.  </p>
<p>One of the main curiosities is the white writers and media personnel.  I have a great curiosity about this - what mother&rsquo;s milk are these freaks drinking that they can incessantly whine about this nonsense?  Do they take thirty pieces of silver along with the job as writer or producer?  Are they told right off the bat that they must hourly betray themselves and their own people in order to advance in the business?  Or do they really believe the garbage they spew?  I wonder.  </p>
<p>The insights that are always displayed in the comments section of these articles are one of my favorites about the site.  I am sometimes moved to laugh loudly at the bang-on gems I read.  Sometimes I think if I had not found AmRen and TOQ I might have gone insane.  </p>

If non-whites don&rsquo;t like this movie, they don&rsquo;t have to see it. I couldn&rsquo;t care less if a black movie gets made that appeals only to black males. I just wouldn&rsquo;t go see it. No big deal. By the way, there were several black males in the theatre when I saw this movie last night. One of them almost started a fight when he had to be told several times by other moviegoers to stop talking on his cellphone.</p>

<p>Cedric the Entertainer did a good Ralph Cramden in the black cast version of the Honeymooners. He accomplished the seemingly impossible feat of playing Cramden the same way Jackie Gleason did without usurping the character.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the movie was generally badly cast and the storyline showed little care. The movie was a box office and artistic failure (except for Cedric&rsquo;s performance) because of bad production work by the white producer and the white director. If they gave an Academy Award for best performance in an otherwise execrable movie, Cedric would have won it hands down.</p>

<p>Yeah, in their minds (and they spell it out for us) if something appeals to any persons of color, this is something we all must celebrate. And not-liking a cultural item or fad that appeals to people of color, why that&rsquo;s bigotry. But don&rsquo;t borrow or steal or adapt the fad yourself, cause that&rsquo;s engaging in a theft of culture.</p>
<p>If something appeals to whites, tho, in their eyes, it works the opposite way. There&rsquo;s something wrong with the fad or those who partake in it. It&rsquo;s just not diverse enough. To tell the truth they just don&rsquo;t like white period (except for themselves, maybe) and by &#8216;them&rsquo; that means just about everyone.  </p>

If those two know-nothing, and no doubt well-compensated and possibly tenured college boobs knew the tempest their inconsequential opinions had whipped up over here, they would no doubt be thrilled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I disagree with the posts here, it&rsquo;s just that with things as they are, and will soon be, the more quickly Joe &amp; Jill learn to mistrust Hollywood and its false patriotism for a country moribund if not dead, the better off they&rsquo;ll be and perhaps end up still alive and fit enough to start again when what&rsquo;s left of the country gives it up for good.</p>
<p>And thank you for the quote from that student, #13.  Perfect match of pupil and &#8220;educator&#8221;. </p>

<p>- Well, you see the ring, not being confined to left-wing ideology, was trying to do what was best for the world, instead of what would be best for its own PR spin machine in a land where lunacy dominates conventional thought, so it picked based on merit instead of race/gender/sexual orientation &#8216;political correctness&rsquo;. Actually a good message for today&rsquo;s youth about why the US functioned much better in the old days when jobs, college admissions, etc were based on merit/performance instead of based on one being the right shade of brown. Of course, self-destructive whites like Mr. Chambliss will never be satisfied no matter how many films are made of Mo&rsquo;Nique flying around with a rainbow lantern ring championing all people of color to fight against the evil white male CEO of an exploitative racist Fortune 500 company. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really simple, for all those that are upset that Green Lantern is a white guy all you have to do is not see the movie. DUUUUUUUUU! boy! that was a real hard one. Also, if you are upset about Green Lantern being white it means that YOU! are simply a racist bigoted pig with a intelligence level of about 100 below plant life and needs to find something worthwhile to do instead of being a professional liberal puke whiner. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Well, there&rsquo;s no particular need for the white guy to be from southern California  &mdash;  but, to answer your question, Yes.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>While I agree that the world would be a better place if Mexicao Reconquista&rsquo;d it, ten seconds before The Big One, the fact is that this is also the home of Edwards Air Force Base.</p>
<p>The only thing that comes close is Paxtuent River out in Maryland and Gromov LII in Russia.</p>
<p>And so solly Mr. Chambliss.  The reason there are more white males in the USAF and USN is because we COMBINE the best traits of:</p>
<p>1.  Hardy Physique.<br>
2.  Disciplined Integrity.<br>
3.  High IQ.</p>
<p>The idiot who plays Hal Jordan does no justice to white test pilots, being little more than a graceless fool (the real danger of endorsing &#8216;White Action Heroes&rsquo; as a cultural icon is that you then give unto your Hollyweird masters the tool by which you are made to look stupid and ineffective as an act of applied character assassination), but the fact remains that flying a fighter is about 10% G-soak and 90% systems management.</p>
<p>And the per-plane value of a 150 million dollar F-35 is such that nobody can afford to &#8216;race norm&rsquo; the IQ requirements of it&rsquo;s pilots, just to make blacks feel better about their back-of-pack character and intellectual deficits.</p>
<p>If men like this-</p>

Dr. Chambliss teaches race and ethnicity, urban history, city planning history, African-American history, and popular history courses. In addition to traditional pedagogy Dr. Chambliss has directed several service learning projects using oral history interviews to explore municipal development, housing, gentrification, and race.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/3gYcm" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/3gYcm</a></p>
<p>Would stop treating race as a confidence trick, they would take a REAL look at African history and realize that they were in a bad way, long before they left Africa.  And demand the genetic investments to fix their flaws rather than the social accomodations to ignore them.</p>
<p>Thank heavens, blacks just aren&rsquo;t that smart.</p>

		<p>Even among white nationalists, there is a steadfast refusal to admit that virtues like altruism, heroism, honesty, decency and goodness, are NOT virtues.  The term implies a universalism that does not exist.  They are white values, culture and traits that can be absorbed to a certain extent by other races (usually to the exact extent of white supremacy) but NEVER originated by them.</p>
<p>Why is Green Lantern white?  For the same reason all heroes are white.  Heroism is a white trait, for the most part.  The very idea of a SUPERhero is a white concept.  A white dream not shared by other cultures unless they have been conquered by us and had some of their traits obliterated to be replaced by white traits.</p>
<p>Perfect example&hellip;.the japanese.  Prior to the post WWII era, the japanese were known for their great, often senseless, cruelty and evil.  The fact that their military needed a steady supply of women to rape (comfort women) who were treated extremely harshly&hellip;..ie raped and tortured almost constantly, during the war&hellip;.says everything about what they were.</p>
<p>After the war, they were basically beaten into submission and had the evil ground out of them by a relentless, totalitarian, prisonlike system. Although only the barest remnants of US involvement remain, the japanese choose such a system, run by themselves, as the best way to keep such a shameful race gestalt from ever manifesting again.  They literally had it ground into them that virtue is to be found in white values, and evil was what they were before&hellip;.and that was shameful.  So they strive to be as much like us as possible and as unalike their shameful past as possible.  Heck, the pattern is so extreme, that in popular japanese anime, all the heroes have one thing in common&hellip;.they all look like white americans.</p>
<p>Other cultures (example, the chinese) are not like this.  To be chinese is to look at your daughter, decide you&rsquo;d rather have a son and bash her head against a rock (and don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s any different&hellip;.such behavior is universal and widespread in a country where nobody can afford abortion).  It&rsquo;s not that it happens.  It&rsquo;s that it happens so much and nobody cares.</p>
<p>From the middle east barbarians that wiped out the christians, to the satan worshipping voodoo africans.  From the heathen indians hunting white scalps for fun to the east indians that bath families in waters with corpses floating nearby.  None of the non-white races self-identified with virtue and made it who they are.</p>
<p>Whites and whites ONLY did that and to a large extent, today, do that.  A white Green Lantern is a mythos grounded in reality.  Were they to make him black, he&rsquo;d just be another multi-cultural lie.</p>
<p>That is the bottom line.</p>

The original theme behind the green lantern was about uniting different races and inter-planetary species under the white race.</p>
<p>To show that races could unite if fused togeather by a single racial ideology of the highest quality.</p>
<p>So far throughout history,the avoidable economic and tyranical outcomes of Socialism and the amalgamation of nations has been proven in one disaster after the next.</p>
<p>As human beings programmed to love and American&rsquo;s responsible for leading by example, we see the regress in Central American poverty and crime, African tribal warfare, and Asian, and European tyranny.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, the green lantern is just a fantasy of a possibility.</p>
<p>One that the white race is being sabotaged to accept.</p>

		<p>   I would think finding a white in southern California these days would definitely fall under the category of &#8220;science fiction.&#8221; That said, my wife and I tried to watch &#8220;Green Lantern,&#8221; on ppv and found it to be not worth the effort.We wrote off the cost and quickly abandoned the movie .<br>
    But I did manage to catch the end of a remarkable old TV show . A 1963 episode of &#8220;Outer Limits,&#8221; starring Phillip Pine titled I think, &#8220;The Hundred Days of the Dragon.&#8221; The premise of the show was that Asians had acquired the the technology to make themselves appear caucasian and had murdered the U.S. president,replacing him with their own clone like puppet whose goal was to dismantle our nation.I did not see one minority actor,the Asian president clone was a white made up to look Asian underneath his caucasian exterior.At the end of the show they actually gave a patriotic pep talk.Can you imagine an America that would produce such a show unapologetically? How did we manage to lose sight of who we are and who we are supposed to be?The nation represented in that TV show is gone, it no longer exist.    </p>

		<p>Here we have a situation where I have to take the (blacks) side.<br>
In watching shows on TV and seeing other movies they seem to be right WHERE IS THE black HERO?<br>
In most shows today we have the foolish bumpkin white guy who can&rsquo;t get anything right UNTIL along comes the black guy. He is book smart, street smart and as he speaks in their ebonized language of choice the White man soon See&rsquo;s this black guy has saved the day. Of course the black guy always speaks in a condescending way to the foolish White man before he sweeps his white female girlfriend off her feet and shows her what black romance is all about.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is this?<br>
Why is none of this true in Real Life?<br>
Go to Africa see black genius at work.<br>
Heck you don&rsquo;t even have to go that far, just check out Detroit.</p>
