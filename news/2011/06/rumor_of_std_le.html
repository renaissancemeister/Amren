<h1>Rumor of STD Led to Slayings, Relatives Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Virginia Bridges and Katelyn Ferral, News Observer (Durham), June 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brinton Marcell Millsap apparently shot three women and himself Friday night because of a rumor he had been exposed to a sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did think that was the case, but it was a lie,&#8221; said Anita D. Baker, the mother of one of the slain women, Alexandria J. Baker Pierce.</p>
<p>Pierce, 23, a rising senior at UNC Greensboro, made an impromptu trip to Durham on Friday to tell Millsap in person that the report that she had given him a disease was not true, Baker said. She left Greensboro in her green Honda Accord about 9 p.m. and picked up her friends, Amesha Alia Page-Smith, 24, and Adrianne Celeste Stevens, 22, both of Durham.</p>
<p>All three would later lie dead inside the car along a vacant stretch of N.C. 54 in Research Triangle Park. Durham County Sheriff Worth Hill said Millsap fatally shot the three women then shot himself once. The car and bodies were discovered just after midnight Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Millsap told his brother, Dustin Lyons, 27, of Durham, that he had had sex with Pierce the weekend before the killings.</p>
<p>Lyons said his brother was struggling with lupus, an immunodeficiency disease, and was &#8220;outraged&#8221; when he heard the rumor that Pierce had given him herpes, a sexually transmitted disease characterized by outbreaks of sores in the genital area, Lyons said. The infection can last in the body indefinitely.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baker said she doesn&rsquo;t know why one of her daughter&rsquo;s friends, &#8220;who was like a daughter to me,&#8221; started the rumor. Her daughter did not have a sexually transmitted disease, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Millsap&rsquo;s lupus affected his skin and a doctor had recently told him he didn&rsquo;t have long to live, said a longtime family friend, Stephanie Adcock.</p>
<p>After the diagnosis, he started to make bad judgments, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before he died, Millsap posted daily on his Facebook wall about street life and a gun, or &#8220;strap.&#8221;</p>
<p>On May 20 he wrote, &#8220;i already kno dat u can cheat death &hellip; God sent me a strap and said use dis wen u need help &hellip; use it rite and ull b blessed &hellip; use it wrong and b on a journey without a purpose &hellip; road to destruction and im part of it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There was a story recently about a ten or eleven year old &#8216;youff&rsquo; who killed some kid younger than him.  The lawyer for the kid started spinning a tale of woe for the murderer, saying it was society&rsquo;s fault that this happened.  I bet the liberal press will go full court here and have a field day blaming whitey somehow for this mess.</p>

<p>This is the level of writing we can expect from seniors at UNC Greensboro?  How can anybody be accepted to a university with this level of writing skill?  Oh, I guess we already know the answer to that&hellip;</p>

		<p>So God provided him with a gun? Certainly, seeing as African Americans are more likely to carry STDs than Caucasians, he had no problem believing the &#8220;lie&#8221; about his sex partner. </p>

		<p>Sorry Chris, but the shooter was not the UNC student, the victim was. Not saying she was any brighter than him though.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t like writing this (and despite what some might think I don&rsquo;t indulge in gratuitous black-bashing for the sake of it), but the case described above is, unfortunately, an archetypal description of black character and behavior - the savagery, the violence, the selfishness and the disregard for life.<br>
  It is for reasons like these that Whites must isolate themselves from blacks as far as humanly possible.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pierce, 23, a rising senior at UNC Greensboro&#8221;</p>
<p>Rising senior?  Judging by his juvenile posts on facebook, his psychopathic tendencies to murder I would say he was not a rising senior, &#8220;unless he had enormous aa help.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed with a terminal illness (before he even had sexual relations with the women), so he was actually the one putting the women at risk.</p>
<p>As many have said, the easiest solution is avoidance.  It is a shame the women didn&rsquo;t head that advice.</p>

		<p>No, no, ChrisM, it was the woman, Pierce, who was a rising senior at UNC Greensboro.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I have to agree with SKIP - a nice tidy resolution.</p>

<p>Even though this kid is obviously in college&hellip;the reason why she shot 3 people is because of a lack of education and poverty&hellip;or maybe institutional racism.</p>
<p>Which makes it &#8220;all ok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not to mention blaming Caucasians. </p>

		<p>Why hello, &#8220;Liz&#8221;(#11)!</p>
<p>So nice of you to drop by and share your SPAM with us!  So good to know there&rsquo;s a spot where people with STDs can go to share their infections.  It&rsquo;s such a pity Brinton Marcell Millsap couldn&rsquo;t have shared his divine inspiration with you, in his own special way.</p>
<p>However, people mostly come to AMREN, not because we&rsquo;re &#8220;lonely and shamed&#8221; due to Venereal Disease, but because we&rsquo;re being disenfranchised and &#8216;genocided&rsquo; due to our being White.</p>
