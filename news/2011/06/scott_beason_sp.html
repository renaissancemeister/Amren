<h1>Scott Beason Sparks Criticism with &#8216;Aborigines&rsquo; Remark</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phillip Rawls, Huffington Post, June 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A top Democrat in Alabama is calling on a Republican state senator to resign after he was caught on tape calling black patrons at a casino &#8220;aborigines.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He was one of three GOP legislators who wore recording devices for the FBI during its investigation. Transcripts of conversations show him denigrating black people at the Greenetrack gambling hall.</p>
<p>Alabama Democratic Party Chairman Mark Kennedy has called for Beason to resign, but Republican Party Chairman Bill Armistead says Beason is an honorable man who doesn&rsquo;t have a racist bone in his body.</p>

		<p>Scott Beason should try to remember that Aborigines talk like Crocodile Dundee and have an average IQ of 50, whereas American Blacks talk like rap videos and have an average IQ of 85. Morons tend to get upset when you mistake them for imbeciles. </p>

<p>The word &#8220;denigrate&#8221; comes from the Latin word &#8220;denigrare&#8221;, which means &#8220;to turn something black&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Beason was wrong to refer to Bantus as &#8216;aborigines&#8221;. The word &#8220;aborigine&#8221; means the earliest inhabitant of a region. North American aborigines - more comnmonly referred to as &#8220;American Indians&#8221; - were here before the blacks. The latter didn&rsquo;t get here until 1619, aboard a Dutch slave ship.</p>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s anything Scott Beason should be criticized for, it&rsquo;s giving blacks too much credit. &#8220;Aborigine&#8221; means &#8220;native&#8221;, so what he was really saying (not intentionally, of course) was that blacks are native to America, which is of course ridiculous and laughable.</p>
<p>This whole thing might seem trivial, but I&rsquo;ve noticed a growing number of (self-proclaimed) &#8220;White Nationalists&#8221; claiming that blacks are &#8220;True Americans&#8221; because &#8220;they&rsquo;ve been here so long.&#8221; As if that&rsquo;s how we should judge people. Is a black whose ancestors came here 300 years ago more of an American than a white whose ancestors came here only 100 years ago? I think not.</p>

		<p>As some posters have pointed out, the term aborigine originally meant native to an area.  Through usage it&rsquo;s come to mean, to most people, primitive, unschooled, ignorant, and lacking in intelligence.</p>
<p>I dunno, sounds like a pretty applicable noun to apply to most black Africans, whether here or in Africa.</p>

		<p>Most white Americans came in 1860 or later as cheap labor for the North. Very few can claim ancestry going back to 1776. Blacks can.</p>

		<p>Reply to #6;</p>
<p>What you say is dead wrong.</p>
<p>The population of the USA in 1860 was about 31 million. There were about 4 million black slaves and a few hundred thousand free ones. That leaves about 26.8 million whites. </p>
<p>In other words there were more then six whites in America at that time for every black. So which group is more likely to have more descendents? I would also add that about 15% of blacks now living in the USA have arrived post-1965. </p>
