<h1>Naomi Campbell vs. Cadbury</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claudine Zap, Yahoo! News, May 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Model Naomi Campbell says she&rsquo;s considering legal action in response to an ad that compares her to a Dairy Milk Bliss bar. Dave M. Benett/Getty Images A new ad for Cadbury chocolate is leaving a bitter taste with Naomi Campbell. {snip}</p>
<p>The ad reads, &#8220;Move over Naomi, there&rsquo;s a new diva in town,&#8221; and shows the candy bar nestled in diamonds. {snip}</p>
<p>Campbell told the U.K. newspaper the Independent, &#8220;I am shocked. It&rsquo;s upsetting to be described as chocolate, not just for me, but for all black women and black people. I do not find any humor in this. It is insulting and hurtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The star {snip} being backed by the British organization Operation Black Vote. The group called on the U.S. company Kraft, which owns Cadbury, to apologize and is considering a boycott of the company&rsquo;s products. Worse, Naomi&rsquo;s mom is mad.</p>
<p>Valerie Morris told the Independent, &#8220;I&rsquo;m deeply upset by this racist advert. Do these people think they can insult black people and we just take it? This is the 21st century, not the 1950s. Shame on Cadbury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cadbury said in a statement that it had pulled the billboards with no plans to repeat the ad, {snip}&#8221;</p>

<p>{snip} Krafts Foods, the company that owns Cadbury, has removed the poster and has no plans to repeat it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly never our intention to cause any offence and the campaign itself is a light-hearted take on the social pretensions of Cadbury Dairy Milk Bliss,&#8221; a statement from Krafts Food said. &#8220;Cadbury takes its responsibility very seriously indeed and we would never produce any marketing activity we felt might cause offence to any section of society.&#8221;<br>

Its ok to be called black when you are in fact brown, but not referenced to chocolate which is brown and I add, well liked.  Give me the secret decoder ring so I know how not to offend you.  Of course if it was an ad by a black/brown/chocolate agency, I suspect no foul would be reported.  <br>
What next a law suit claiming discrimination as 29% prefer vanilla ice cream versus a mere 8.9% for chocolate.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not like it said &#8220;Move over Naomi, there&rsquo;s a better chocolate in town.&#8221;  Honestly, I think this whole scenario was manufactured and Mrs. Campbell was in on it just to give herself some publicity.  </p>

		<p>I am certainly not &#8216;melanin-challenged.&#8221; If I were a woman, I&rsquo;d be thrilled to be on a BillBoard and to be the subject of a major chocolate maker&rsquo;s advertisement. </p>
<p>Ms. Campbell has never shied from attention. One wonders why this particular comparison was so odious. Could it be because this is the one ad where the ad-maker does not pretend that Naomi is a very well-tanned white woman but expressly acknowledges that she is black? I think this &#8220;hissy-fit&#8221; may have more to do with Ms. Campbell&rsquo;s neuroses than racism, real or imagined.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a typical case of &#8220;when blacks scream &#8216;racism.&rsquo; who&rsquo;s the <i>real</i> racist?&#8221; </p>
<p>The ad says nothing about race. Obviously, the ad agency that designed this ad saw no racial connections either. Of course, we all know that&rsquo;s what any company wants to do: set itself up for an expensive lawsuit.  All firms involved were obviously completely clueless about the nature of blacks.</p>
<p>Oh, because chocolate is brown, that makes it an obvious racial reference? Silly me. How many blacks complained about mayor Ray Nagin&rsquo;s description of New Orleans as a &#8220;chocolate city?&#8221; The would&rsquo;ve voted him back into office if their numbers in that city had remained a majority.</p>

<p>Your comment reminds me of the song &#8220;You&rsquo;re So Vain&#8221;.  She thinks the ad&rsquo;s about her.  And then leaps to an idiotic conclusion.</p>
<p>Would that I lived in a world in which the Cadbury CEO calls Naomi Campbell &#8220;a silly twat&#8221;, and then expands on the advertising theme.</p>

		<p>IF Cadbury was actually referring to Naomi Campbell and not, say, Naomi Judd (divas SING, do they not?) then she would&rsquo;ve had a better argument if she just sued for using her name without permission. As it is, she sounds hysterical and whiny. But, what else is new in BRA?</p>

I agree with both of you. I would be highly upset if a company or some individual attemptedd to capitalize off my name or fame in an effort to promote their product without my permission. I am sure many of you would feel the same way.</p>
<p>Past behavior aside, I am with Ms. Campbell on this one.</p>

		<p>A PR stunt. Like when Pars Hilton lost her dog. Naomi isn&rsquo;t even remotely pretty, not even for an AfroWoman. I&rsquo;ll take Tyra Banks, a third of her black ANTM contestants, Rihana, Foxy Brown, a young Whitney Houston or Toni Braxton over Naomi any time. She knows she&rsquo;s not all that  and that she&rsquo;s coasting on being dark but not that hideous and that&rsquo;s what her infamous hissy fits are all about.</p>

		<p>Naomi Campbell is always upset about something though. She&rsquo;s constantly in a huffy mood and can and will take exception to anything, racial or not.</p>
<p>But, is it just me, or does it seem as if they knew that she would react this way, and are sort of having fun with her because of her infamous attitude?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes amazing to behold how clueless, selfish and self-absorbed upper middle class and upper class blacks can be.</p>
<p>Campbell thinks reference to her skin color as chocolate is somehow &#8220;racist&#8221;, somehow injurious to her race and humiliating to her as a person.  I seriously doubt Campbell ever experienced a single second of pain, drawback or even stress due to her race, chocolate or anything else.</p>
<p>And she can&rsquo;t be bothered to know the plight of people who have&hellip;..tasted the lash, pain, misery and death, because of the color of their skin&hellip;.and chocolate.  In fact, I would guess that many people have experienced much harm so that her increasingly fat behind gets that way due to all the chocolate she personally stuffs into her mouth.</p>

		<p>It appears that the ad was actually comparing the chocolate to a &ldquo;diva&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s vernacular- not a black woman in particular. I don&rsquo;t claim to understand British humor, but it seems to me that any &ldquo;diva&rdquo; would do. The more famous the better I suppose. Naoimi Campbell should be so lucky to have the publicity. Beauty fades. Corporations will take note to be sure, and use a white &ldquo;diva&rdquo; next time- white chocolate or dark. Of course when blacks are overlooked for ads of this nature in the future- they will sue and demand quotas or initiate boycotts.</p>

		<p>Nothing shocking here to a person from St Louis, MO.  Aside from the compensation issue for use of name (which   &mdash;   if this is what she is really suing over, should state plainly), we&rsquo;ve had lawsuits in my own city against a furniture company that used the description &#8220;color: negro&#8221; for some of their couches.  Yes, some moron actually took it to court. Thankfully they lost, but not before several TV stations carried it like it was a serious complaint. My city also brought us the black suing over a carry out pizza employee used the descriptor &#8220;The pizza is for the large black man, in the red shirt&#8221; on their carry out ticket when they didn&rsquo;t leave a name when asked. The news media reacted the same to that incident as well. </p>
<p>Black bad behavior, and stupidity is the same the world over; regardless of culture, regardless of relative wealth, or poverty. Why should any of us expect blacks in Britain to behave any better? </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s funny. Years ago when Naomi Campbell was arrested at a European Airport &amp; called the arresting officers, &#8220;evil white crackers&#8221;, there was no outcry of racism by the public. But then again they probably felt bad for her because every one knows that the term &#8220;Cracker&#8221; was used for poor Southern US plantation workers. NOT European law enforcement. But don&rsquo;t let a little history lesson educate you, Naomi. It&rsquo;d be like me calling Naomi a &#8220;Somalian slut.&#8221; She is obviously of black blood, not mixed Arab $ African</p>
