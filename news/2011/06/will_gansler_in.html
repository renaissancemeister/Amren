<h1>Will Gansler Investigate CASA&rsquo;s Voter Suppression?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Examiner, June 29, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} To demonstrate that he truly is acting without political motives, [Maryland Attorney General] Gansler should immediately investigate CASA de Maryland&rsquo;s attempts to intimidate voters attempting to halt implementation of Maryland&rsquo;s Dream Act.</p>
<p>Del. Michael Smigiel, R-Eastern Shore, told The Washington Examiner that callers from around the state informed him that CASA operatives were interfering with the referendum petition drive and harassing voters, even to the point of deliberately standing between them and the signature gatherers. Under Article 16 of the Maryland Constitution, the people have a right to pursue a referendum that voids the actions of the state legislature, which in this case is an extremely unpopular law forcing taxpayers to subsidize college tuition for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>As Smigiel points out, CASA&rsquo;s actions are &#8220;more in-your-face than robocalls,&#8221; and thus constitute a more serious attempt at voter suppression. Equally egregious is the State Board of Elections&rsquo; initial decision to hand over original petition documents containing tens of thousands of signatures so CASA could take them to an outside firm for copying. {snip}</p>
<p>CASA, which lobbied heavily in favor of the Dream Act and referred to petition gatherers as &#8220;a small minority of extremists,&#8221; has a vested interest in the outcome of the referendum, which will be on the November ballot if the required 55,736 signatures are verified by today&rsquo;s deadline {snip}.</p>

		<p>Expect no action on the part of Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;Justice&#8221; Department. But if they should find a &#8220;noose&#8221; within so much as 5,000 yards of a black polling center, then it&rsquo;s a federal affair.</p>

		<p>This just in. <br>
Over 100,000 signatures have just been turned in to the<br>
Board of Elections in <br>
Annapolis. Over twice the needed amount.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think CASA would behave this way if there weren&rsquo;t a real chance of this measure passing. The people responsible for this petition drive have two options. They can have someone stand out of view with a camera and record this kind of behavior. Then present copies to the media and online. This should garner enough pressure to force Gansler to act. Alternatively, they can hire some muscle and back their supporters up. I would strongly urge the first option. As the second option could backfire should a situation get out of hand.</p>

		<p>But if they should find a &ldquo;noose&rdquo; within so much as 5,000 yards of a black polling center, then it&rsquo;s a federal affair.</p>
<p>If even one CASA member ended up at the end of a noose, the entire organization would vanish into thin air.</p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me how passive people are when they are being oppressed and intimidated.  Many people seem to want to be a whole chapter in Foxs Book of Martyrs.  Perhaps some day the white population of the US will stop being timid twits and fight back.</p>
