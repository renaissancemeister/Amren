<p>Isabel Chavelo Gutierrez was in the middle of assaulting the elderly victim when he complained to her that he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and stopped having sex with her, the Corpus Christi Caller reported.</p>
<p>He then rolled over and fell unconscious and the woman was able to escape her house. Gutierrez was dead by the time authorities arrived.</p>

<p>That never happens. Only the helpless and innocent suffer at the hands of these fiends.<br>
And yes, Isabel is Spanish for Elizabeth. </p>

		<p>Remember &#8220;A Boy Named Sue&#8221;?</p>
<p>In my junior high, we had a guy named Lynn.  First day of school, he had to embarrassingly tell each teacher calling roll, &#8220;My name&rsquo;s on the girls&rsquo; list.&#8221;  He turned tough right away (and maintained himself on the bottom of the class, though his bursts of insight and creativity showed he was really better than the bottom.)  Later, I had a boss named Leslie, who possessed a disproportionate (for his background and education) number of hangups about how women&rsquo;s brains worked, what type of projects women could do well at, etc.  </p>
<p>I suspect Isabel&rsquo;s problem has more to do with his name than his ethnicity, though the machismo of his culture may have amplified the stress.  Also, Mexico is Catholic, and there is a Catholic tradition in monastic communities of renaming postulants with saints&rsquo; names of any gender:  Sister Michael, etc.  Wonder how much lay Latin Catholics do this sort of thing:  I&rsquo;ve heard names like &#8220;Jose Maria&#8221;.  Maybe his mom had a &#8220;miracle&#8221; happen to her on St. Isabel&rsquo;s day.  Or perhaps she simply didn&rsquo;t want a boy.   </p>

		<p>The name &#8220;Marie&#8221; or &#8220;Maria&#8221; is sometimes added as a second name for boy in traditional French and Spanish culture. In Italy I think it was usually masculinized to &#8220;Mario.&#8221; There was no stigma attached to it, it meant a sort of &#8220;dedication&#8221; of the child to the Virgin Mary. Nobody would have made fun of the practice, as it was so common. However, I do not know of any other female name being thus bestowed on boys.<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget golfer Jose Maria Olazabal. This isn&rsquo;t confined to only Hispancs. There were German authors, Rainer Maria Rilke and Erich Maria Remarque - who wrote &#8220;All Quiet on the Western Front&#8221;.</p>

		<p>A male having Maria as the middle name is not unheard of among Roman Catholics in Hungary and Austria.  As a first name, no.</p>
<p>Isabel is not a boys name.  Bad enough this guy was born what he was born but his parents really socked it to him.</p>

		<p>Way to go!  You&rsquo;ve heard the old saying: &#8220;what goes around comes around&#8221;?  The only thing that would have made it better is if the poor old woman had had a razor in there in case he showed up&hellip;</p>

		<p>There are a few names that serve both genders;  this is particularly common in Latin countries (including Italy). Carmen and Andrea, for instance, can be male or female. </p>
<p>Sometimes in England names can go both ways (e.g. Leslie or Lesley, Ashley, Alexis, Evelyn, Meredith, Vivian). Francis and Frances, Robin and Robyn, Sidney and Sydney.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know about Isabel. (Or Isobel?)  That&rsquo;s very odd.  Perhaps there&rsquo;s a masculine equivalent that  his mother didn&rsquo;t know about. I don&rsquo;t either. </p>
<p>Incidently, the Italian/Spanish &#8220;Mario&#8221; comes from the Latin Marius, a very Roman name (pre-Christian, that is).  But now it is  the Christian equivalent of Maria.<br>

		<p>Also here in Chicagoland, there are quite a few male Poles named Jan and Marion.</p>

		<p>I wonder if she prayed while this animal played his games.  And what God answered when he explained that it was &#8216;all in the plan&rsquo;.  The Liberal Marxist Democratic Elect A New Polity Plan.</p>
<p>How a sex offender is out on the streets with anything less than a permanent GPS tag on his ankle and a call-in to his parole tracker five times a day (leaving for work, at work, leaving work, at home, going to bed) also confuses me.</p>
<p>The best defense is not offense but _preparation_ as a means to enforce deterrence.</p>

		<p>The Polish name &#8220;Jan&#8221; is pronounced &#8220;Yon&#8221;.  It is their version of &#8220;John&#8221;.  &#8220;Marion&#8221; is just another version of Mario or Marius.</p>
