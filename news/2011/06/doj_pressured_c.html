<h1>DOJ Pressured City of Dayton to Lower Testing Standards for Police Recruits to Accommodate Minority Candidates</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Judicial Watch, June 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Judicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption, announced today that it has uncovered hundreds of documents from the City of Dayton, Ohio, showing that Department of Justice (DOJ) officials pressured the Dayton Police Department to lower testing standards because not enough African American candidates passed the written exam. {snip}</p>
<p>The documents obtained by Judicial Watch include the City of Dayton&rsquo;s standards and test materials for police and firefighter candidates produced by Fire &amp; Police Selection, Inc., a company with a 15-year track record of designing and validating tests used to recruit police officers and firefighters. {snip}</p>
<p>The City of Dayton submitted ahead of time its recruitment and testing plans in detail (including its written examination), per the request of the DOJ. Dayton also took steps to focus its recruitment strategy on &#8220;minority  &mdash;  African-Americans, Hispanic, Asian, Females and other underrepresented minority groups.&#8221; These plans apparently did not elicit any significant objection from the DOJ until after the tests had been administered and scores were calculated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a letter dated February 7, 2011, DOJ Senior Attorney Barbara Thawley informed the City of Dayton that the DOJ rejected the written portion of the Dayton examination: &#8220;The United States has determined that the City&rsquo;s proposed use of the written examination&hellip;violates&hellip;the Civil Rights Act of 1964&hellip;because it has a statistically significant disparate impact upon African American candidates&hellip;&#8221; The letter closed by threatening court action. A subsequent letter on February 17, 2011, suggests the written exam be used as a &#8220;pass/fail&#8221; screening device, which the DOJ described as a &#8220;compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DOJ also objected to the use of a written test in general for firefighter applicants. &#8220;With regard to the writing portion for firefighter, it seems unusual to me. I have never seen a fire department give a writing test to entry level firefighter applicants. From what I know about the job, it seems very unlikely that an entry-level firefighter would have to do much writing,&#8221; wrote Ms. Thawley. &#8220;All of our firefighters are either EMT or paramedics and do a lot of report writing,&#8221; responded Giselle S. Johnson, Secretary and Chief Examiner, Civil Service Board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a report by Dayton&rsquo;s ABC News affiliate on March 11, 2011, the ultimate compromise struck between the City of Dayton and the DOJ resulted in a lowering of test standards for Police Department candidates:</p>
<blockquote>The Dayton Police Department is lowering its testing standards for recruits. It&rsquo;s a move required by the U.S. Department of Justice after it says not enough African-Americans passed the exam. Dayton is in desperate need of officers to replace dozens of retirees. The hiring process was postponed for months because the D.O.J. rejected the original scores provided by the Dayton Civil Service Board, which administers the test.
<p>Under the previous requirements, candidates had to get a 66% on part one of the exam and a 72% on part two. The D.O.J. approved new scoring policy only requires potential police officers to get a 58% and a 63%. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of an &#8216;F&rsquo; and a &#8216;D&rsquo;.</blockquote></p>

		<p>First, it goes without saying that there have been incompetent whites in these positions.</p>
<p>But overall, how many people have died over the past five decades because of incompetent black firemen, paramedics, emergency support personal, surgeons&hellip;that absolutely   &mdash;  NEVER  &mdash;   should have been hired in the first place.</p>
<p>Rigorous tests with questions about emergency rescue procedures, county rules and regulations, or medical questions about the human body are not racist !!!</p>
<p>No matter how you slice it, you are   &mdash;  LOWERING STANDARDS  &mdash;   to make an accomodation for non-whites who lack the common sense and intelligence to study for and pass these tests.  </p>
<p>If you lower standards for these important positions, how could even one person not realize what a disaster for society this is?  </p>
<p>If someone disagrees with me, can they please give me an example of a &#8220;RACIST&#8221; question on these exams that is not fair to non-whites?    </p>

When I was in high school anything below 75% was an F. The system is already dumbed down - how low can we go?</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I want [police officers that LOOK LIKE ME racially! I do not want a minority cop or fireman coming into my house if I have to call late at night. We hear of these types of cops comitting crimes, rapes, murders all too often and minorities are more likely to IMPERSONATE police officers. A lot of that lately too.</p>

		<p>Those who advocate affirmative action knowingly and necessarily lie about it. They say it does not lower standards for blacks and discriminate against whites but it does. In addition, by elevating blacks to positions where they are unable to perform adequately, affirmative action reinforces racial prejudice. </p>

		<p>Not because Obama&rsquo;s/Holder&rsquo;s Department of Justice found the test impartially administered or particularly unfair in any way, but just &#8220;&hellip;because it has a statistically significant disparate impact upon African American candidates&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>You hear enough horror stories about large city police departments. Now, you can put Dayton, Ohio on you list of cities to avoid like the plague. Think about it, would a company that specializes in Police and Fire Recruit testing last very long if you didn&rsquo;t weed out those who were not qualified? I want my local cops and firemen to be qualified, not to meet some artificial quota. </p>
<p>If you want to understand what it takes to make a top notch fireman, go to www.hulu.com and look up &ldquo;The Academy&rdquo;. The third season follows the training class at the Orange County Fire Authority. All of the 28 students are male, one is Asian, a few here and there are Hispanic, but the rest are white males. Too much merit in this group. One of the recruits played pro football (American style) in Europe. If it takes a man who is 6&rsquo;4&#8221; and 240 lbs to wield a charged hose up a ladder, so be it. A man who is 5&rsquo;2&#8221; and 125 lbs may do a lot of things well, but firefighting may not be the career for him. </p>
<p>&#8220;The DOJ also objected to the use of a written test in general for firefighter applicants. &ldquo;With regard to the writing portion for firefighter, it seems unusual to me. I have never seen a fire department give a writing test to entry level firefighter applicants. From what I know about the job, it seems very unlikely that an entry-level firefighter would have to do much writing,&rdquo; wrote Ms. Thawley. &ldquo;All of our firefighters are either EMT or paramedics and do a lot of report writing,&rdquo; responded Giselle S. Johnson, Secretary and Chief Examiner, Civil Service Board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if entry level firemen don&rsquo;t do a lot of report writing, they will as they move up the ladder into greater positions of authority. Is it too much to demand that legal documents can be read and understood? I&rsquo;m sure that Billy Bob the Fireman might make the occasional grammatical error, but if the document is written in ebonics, it will not hold up in court. Just ask any policeman about their level of report writing. </p>
<p>The &#8220;Bell Curve&#8221; had a story about how the Washington DC Police Department was putting almost borderline retarded people through the academy in the early 1980&rsquo;s. This proved to be problematic with the district attorneys who could not make sense of the police reports and often had to throw out cases. FWIW, the demographics of the Washington DC police department are 61% black, 29% white, 10% other. The numbers are similar in Detroit. </p>
<p>In a May 27th, 2011 article in the Detroit Free Press, Jeff Gerritt writes about how evidence is treated like garbage by the Detroit PD. The city ordered the crime lab closed in 2008 and the Michigan State Police took over. </p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, a lot of it, including sealed evidence bags, ballistic tests and records of investigation, was virtually left to rot in a former elementary school that, at least recently, was unsecured. A window was broken and parts of a fence around the perimeter have collapsed. As recently as Monday, the front door was ajar. The building contained not only evidence but also buckets of live ammo, bulletproof vests and toxic chemicals.&#8221;</p>
<p>This might explain why there are literally 1000&rsquo;s of unsolved murders going back to the 1970&rsquo;s in Detroit. </p>

		<p>How can anyone continue to believe that blacks are not less intelligent, on average, than whites and Asians? The DOJ must understand the racial difference in IQ or they wouldn&rsquo;t be asking for lower testing standards to increase the number of blacks.</p>
<p>When can we stop pretending and finally say, out loud, that the emperor has no clothes?</p>

<p>Herein lies the rub; black people also want cops and firemen who look like them, and Dayton has a higher black population than is currently represented in their police and fire departments.</p>
<p>I would say they get what they deserve, except that black AND white residents will be dangerously &#8220;under-served&#8221; when unqualified blacks are placed in these vacancies.  </p>
<p>Obviously, the Obama administration is going to see that blacks fill these positions regardless of the compromise to the safety of Dayton&rsquo;s citizens and other Dayton cops and firemen who ARE qualified for their jobs.</p>

		<p>There is no appeasing them. No way.  No matter how many concessions  you give them, they want more.</p>
<p>The obvious solution, ultimately, is to abolish all written tests. Maybe ALL tests entirely.  That is what it is coming to.</p>

		<p>If race was really unimportant, and the races really were all equal, nobody would think to lower the standards of a test so that blacks could pass. They&rsquo;d be able to pass without any special accomodation. Also, it&rsquo;s no wonder that so many cities are crumbling if this is an example of how city employees are hired.</p>

		<p>&#8221; I do not want a minority cop coming into my house&#8221;  The one that came into mine when I reported a burgalry, knew the criminal mind so well, (close proximity?) that he walked right over to the drainage ditch, looked in and got all my stuff back!!! He explained that the crooks were probably Black (in this neighborhood), most likely on foot, and have a habit of stashing the goods in the nearest shrub or concealment, until they are able to cajole a partner in returning with a car to get the items. <br/>
 When a friend got burgalized, I walked over to the large bush on the corner of the neighbor`s lot and voila!! My friend was soo impressed he took me to Denny`s. Another trick I learned and always seems to work, is that when your car won`t start because of a dead battery, put it in neutral and try again. The engine doesn`t need as much juice to overcome the transmission if it would be  in park. It`ll work about 60% of the time in certain situations. Hope this advice helps&hellip;</p>

		<p>Nothing will be remembered because numbers that produce expected results are not seen for the value of the statistical trends they indicate _could be changed_, if we wanted to.</p>
<p>Show an American a white society without ethnic encumberment and suddenly the big picture snaps into place: &#8216;This is what we can do.  This is what is wrong with the way we do things now.  This is what makes us different.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Better.</p>
<p>Speaking of &#8216;useless statistics&rsquo;, I picked this up from a Pajamasmedia forum response-</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/F7zSo" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/F7zSo</a></p>
<p>In 2009, roughly 60-70% of both 4th and 8th graders were in the &#8216;below basic or basic&rsquo; level reading groups with only 2-10% rated as advanced (pages 15 and 33).</p>
<p>If trends continue, we will not be able to sustain advanced literacy as a requirement for ANY state services driven testing regimen.</p>
<p>So much for NCLB.</p>

		<p>Looks like the &#8220;wise&#8221; and &#8220;impartial&#8221; DOJ headed by Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder is doing a fabulous job of ruining ANOTHER city thru their nonsensical bullying. BRA is a disastrous failure, the sooner people wake up to this the sooner we can get America back to its former glory. </p>
<p>As of now Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder is making it more and more difficult for the sane non-black segment of the population to feel safe. Some justice there for you, more like social justice.</p>

		<p>I was once in a CA freeway accident (actually, I have been in several!). The driver who hit me was black, and the two CHP officers were Hispanic. Surprisingly, no one was hostile towards me. The black driver would not admit fault, but he was neither violent nor belligerent. He was relatively polite. The policemen were also relatively polite and remained neutral. I was lucky. The one horrifying detail was that the policeman filling out the accident report could not read&hellip;even simple words.</p>

		<p>In the SC case of Ricci v. DeStefano the city of New Haven, Conn failed to promote whites who passed the fireman&rsquo;s test because black applicants failed to pass the test.<br/>
Supreme Ct ruled that the city was wrong in failing to promote the people who passed the test. Basically they found that the city did everything it could to make the test completely fair and the blacks still failed. The city failed to promote because of a feared lawsuit. The court said that avoiding unintentional discrimination cannot justify intentional discrimination.</p>
<p><br/>
Lawyers at DOJ should not be able to dictate what tests should be. If allowed, they will eventually dictate that blacks should receive more credit for their answers than whites.  City should make fair tests and go with them.<br/>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter one iota that ONE black cop &#8220;knew the criminal mind so well&#8221; and helped you out. (blacks know blacks, that is all). I will also wager that a WHITE cop would know this also. I have had dealings with minority cops and I STILL want a RACIALLY aware WHITE cop responding to any call. I want what USED to be taken for granted in White America. I want to live around, do business with people that LOOK like me, period! I want MY America back, and for those who say we can never have it again, then I say, then our life is not worth living if we are to live in a dark America. So, which will it be? There has to be a choice made and soon.</p>

		<p>You cannot argue that different groups are the same and yet lower standards for particular groups. It is contradictory.</p>
<p>If you lower job requirements for certain groups that means that certain groups are less capable.</p>

<p><br/>
Yes, it may  eventually come to that, a skewed system where different races receive different credits for the same answers. That, or something similar.</p>
<p>Or, when it becomes apparent to the &#8220;social engineers&#8221;, after endless manipulating and finageling, that the blacks and browns STILL do not do well on tests, then it will be  ruled that tests are an essentially biased method  of hiring and they will be done away with completely&hellip; to be replaced by some  sort of race-based quota system.</p>
<p>After all, blacks have difficulty sitting still for long, they have difficulty concentrating, they have difficulty relating to the written word or  following written instructions.  Tests require all of these things   &mdash;  - concentration, patience, and self-control. So, it&rsquo;s obvious (someone will claim) that tests are pro-white and anti-black and are essentially discriminatory.  Written tests, abstract questions, and paperwork are just not a  &#8220;black thang&#8221;.</p>
<p>(Perhaps a verbal test could be devised that could be administered on a basketball court, in between shooting hoops???)</p>

		<p>Inability to pass a written test = limited or insufficient cognitive ability = failure in tasks requiring decision making, planning and PROBLEM SOLVING. This is the way it will always go; the outcome is utterly predicable&hellip;it is preordained.<br/>
    Someone above remarked that &#8220;in former times dumb Whites obtained civil service jobs&#8221;. That is very true; there were dumb cops and dumb sanitation workers, but their work was always directed and monitored by competent Whites, and they were never able to rise to positions of authority or command. Today things are different: when dysfunctional, low IQ Blacks obtain these positions, they start to believe they actually deserve them and then demand to climb the departmental ladder. The result is Detroit, the result is OTB in New York, the result is Port Au Prince, the result is South Africa.<br/>
    Some men in my family took the NYC Fireman test in the early 60s. They had to know math up to square root; they had to use<br/>
formulas for compression and water pressure; they had to be able to read and understand the fire code! <br/>
   I predict death and destruction for Dayton, Ohio. <br/>

		<p>A number of years ago I was working the appropriately named &#8220;grave yard shift&#8221; at a motel in Arlington, Virginia when I was robbed at gun point by two blacks. <br/>
 <br/>
Two white police officers took my report. While they were there a black police officer came by and talked to one of them outside of the motel. I wanted him to come in and talk to me too, because I wanted to be reminded that most blacks are not criminals. He left without talking to me.<br/>
 <br/>
I want blacks on police forces. Most are probably better suited for patrolling black neighborhoods. Nevertheless, I want them to be just as qualified as the white police officers. <br/>
 <br/>
Blacks and their white apologists should be ashamed to demand lower standards for blacks. The demands draw attention to average racial differences in intelligence. </p>

<p>Take it easy, things will change? That is wrong with Whites like you. Yeah, look at how &#8220;things have changed since the 50&rsquo;s&#8221;. So let us just wait some more and see &#8220;how things change&#8221;? So, it&rsquo;s going to get better for our White children and grandchildren? Is that the &#8220;change&#8221; that is coming?  As for &#8220;consuming&#8221; me, I beg your pardon? Just because I SEE reality and SEE the consequences of our folly, now I am consumed? If that is the case, then I suggest MORE Whites become consumed!</p>
<p>Race isn&rsquo;t everything, you say?  Enjoy the outdoors? </p>
<p>YES, race IS everything in the world today. 95% of what White nations are going through is because of RACE. Socially, economically, criminally, racial attacks, dumbing down of our schools and children, unscientific &#8220;science&#8221;, the erasing of our HERITAGE and Constitution, the erasing and debasement of our culture, quotas and AA hiring at OUR expense, whole neighborhoods, cities and states in ruins and bankrupt due to the COSTS of keeping afloat minority races and their criminal and welfare tendencies, their cries of White racism EVERYWHERE, and the list goes on and on. Yes, I call it a DARK America coming.</p>
<p>As for outdoors, who says I don&rsquo;t get outdoors? Are you safe from attacks by blacks, etc. anywhere? Indoors or outdoors?  You like driving down the streets or heaven forbid WALKING and shopping amongst these uncivilized, loud, obnoxious, chaotic peoples? If so, YOU go for it.</p>
<p>You must live and get outdoors where there are NO throngs of nonwhites to even suggest what you have in your post. </p>

		<p>By the 1970s it became obvious that ending racial discrimination would not achieve racial equality. This is because blacks really do tend to be significantly less intelligent than whites for genetic reasons. <br/>
 <br/>
Because liberals cannot disprove what I just wrote, and because they privately know it is true, they have made it dangerous to say it in public. That is why I am on the lam from the Thought Police. <br/>

<p>According to this &#8220;expert&#8221; O&rsquo;connell, the black and latino students do score lower on academic tests, but it is a cultural thang&hellip;not racial!  Their culture makes them score lower!  He cites clapping loudly in black churches as one of the causes.   </p>
<p>Oh, well, that changes everything! </p>
<p>Anyhow, the point is, if they do worse in school, they will do worse on employment tests.  </p>
<p>O,Connell goes on to put part of the blame on whites. </p>
<p>&#8220;We institutionalized lower expectations,&#8221; said O&rsquo;Connell, who ended the double standard last year. &#8220;We&rsquo;re all guilty.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Where does &#8220;these&#8221; people get the authority to lower testing standards??  Does &#8220;those&#8221; people want an idiot that can&rsquo;t read or write trying to save their life?  All of the hours required by the states for fireman training should not allow this to happen.  A fireman has to have a certain number of hours of training each month to stay updated on any new techniques&hellip;.that requires reading!  Trying to find a house that is on fire or needs medical attention requires a driver to read street signs!  Someone&rsquo;s life could be on the line &amp; a driver can&rsquo;t read won&rsquo;t be able to get to that person&rsquo;s house in time.  Also, potential drivers of any fire vehicle have to go to driving classes &amp; have additional training plus testing requires a person to read as well.  How can this be allowed to happen?  Gee&hellip;.I feel safe already.</p>

		<p>@21 Ben,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
You cannot argue that different groups are the same and yet lower standards for particular groups. It is contradictory.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Yes you can, that&rsquo;s the problem which whites refuse to face up to.</p>
<p>Rome did it with hyper-intelligent &#8216;Greek&rsquo; slaves.  South Africa -is- doing it with equally smart, Germanic/Dutch Boers.  IQ = 125-135 whites are serving as an expert slave class to government enabled IQ = 84 (college graduate) blacks who are paid twice or more what their white intelligentsia are and never allowed out of the backroom where the quality of their work is what truly sustains that failed state.  And even this is not assured.  Because the blacks also genocidally butcher Boer farmers.  And import Chinese and Indian replacements in everything from IT to science and engineering.</p>
<p>And the blacks can do this because:</p>
<p>1.  The world falsely sees them as victims and gives the whites <br/>
    no out as an incredibly valuable social resource.<br/>
2.  The blacks have a huge numeric+violence driven statistical <br/>
    advantage which native ZA whites fear genocidally upsetting <br/>
    because blacks have a history full of destroying everything <br/>
    valuable BEFORE they wonder about what comes next.<br/>
3.  Whites assume that the status quo will improve when the <br/>
    blacks get their attitude of prolonged social <br/>
    discrimination &#8216;out of their systems.&rsquo;  Instead of seeing <br/>
    that ex-slaves don&rsquo;t want equality, they want reversal.  To <br/>
    become the master.  Forever.  And Ever.<br/>
4.  Whites fear losing whatever is left of an advanced culture <br/>
    more than blacks do.  Or at least they see it coming from <br/>
    farther off and fight harder to avoid the final endgame as a <br/>
    decent lifestyle.  Smart blacks recognize this and hang <br/>
    whites by hostaging their very achievements.<br/>
5.  By the time whites realize it&rsquo;s never coming back, they will <br/>
    not be in a position to militantly or by &#8216;long trek&rsquo; flight, <br/>
    escape to anywhere else.  One of the many post-Apartheid <br/>
    new Constitution ZA laws being that whites may not have <br/>
    their own separation, from blacks, anywhere in South Africa <br/>
    or it&rsquo;s surrounds.  Because, deep down, blacks know they <br/>
    cannot hack it without -some- intelligent slave labor to <br/>
    serve them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
If you lower job requirements for certain groups that means that certain groups are less capable.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The Romans institutionalized slavery as a means to avoid having to continue to do the work (specifically indigenous agro and industry development associated with land ownership) which made the Republic a stable example of empowered citizens self-sustaining their culture through both personal commercial success and social state service.  The end of the Republic was also the end of large Roman families able to fulfill all elements of social responsibility as much as privilege.</p>
<p>Yet despite this obvious precipice, it took them another 500 years to be nudged out by social engineering treachery of the Equites, Imperium Maius and Senatorial classes, all vying for power by dividing and redividing Provincial tax bases and military as civil power brokering.</p>
<p>The Roman Imperial Period became that where foreign ethnies were invited to become citizens at the cost of social cohesion which was itself less suppressed than paid off by &#8216;bread and circus&rsquo; politics to appease the remaining Roman working class into becoming a mindless pudding of mentally and physically unfit proto-welfare nanny statists.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?  This is a deliberate &#8216;historical reenactment&rsquo; progression being repeated, cyclically.  Yet if it is taken to it&rsquo;s full extent, in a modern age of massive chemical waste and nuclear power, it will destroy us all.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Equality of Opportunity doesn&rsquo;t equate to Equality of Representation.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is why a society can succeed, technically, but if it is still the victim of inherited class behaviors as &#8216;wealth assurance&rsquo; (privilege maintaining) doctrines, it&rsquo;s governance will never reflect the social needs of it&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>To conserve their cultural as their genetic values and thus the reason they trust their elites to govern them.</p>
<p>The rich get rich (and certainly stay that way), not by social complimentarism with their underclasses but by exploiting the poor as stupid.  Which increasingly means an ethnic group as most of the non-white world has sub-90 IQs.</p>
<p>An intelligent, stable, _white_, middle class is anathema to our privileged elite.  Because the elite hate making room at the top for those who cream up and we don&rsquo;t spend enough to sustain them otherwise.  Junk consumerism from huge poverty classes do make such privilege maintenance possible.</p>
<p>Of course the wealthy are as vulnerable now to social entropy as ever the Roman Patricians were.  The difference is that they know it.  And prefer corruption to competition as sustaining the system of Old Money as class inheritance.<br/>

<p>&ldquo;…then our life is not worth living if we are to live in a dark America. So, which will it be? There has to be a choice made and soon.&rdquo;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Dead on correct.  Keep on spreading the word.  Racial Homeland, Robotic Labor Replacement, Active Genetics.  The three things that will save us.  If anything can.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Wow, man, take it easy. Things will change, but don&rsquo;t let all of this get to you in such a way or else it will consume you.<br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No they won&rsquo;t.  History in fact tells us the opposite.</p>
<p>I would suggest that the U.S. is at or past the same point as Rome was when Rome faced Attila at The Catalaunian Fields.  </p>
<p>Whites are the Flavius Aetius of our own country.  </p>
<p>Paraded out when a tough problem needs solving or a war must be fought, bravely.  And then whipped back into obscurity so that the other races may &#8216;celebrate&rsquo; their victory as our hard work and total disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>The difference is whether we pull a Diocletian Divide et Impera -before- we are &#8216;sacked&rsquo;.  Or wait until the the obvious rape of Rome is accomplished in fact as well as demographic futures.</p>
<p>Whites, who have a _unique vision_, not only of what we have but where we can go with it, live on a different plain of reality from other ethnies who see power purely for it&rsquo;s own sake (social vs. tribal altruism and loyalty).</p>
<p>To a black or hispanic, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they or the society they represent have -less- than what once was, only that they have THE MOST of whatever is still remaining.</p>
<p>This graceful, &#8216;fail operative&rsquo; style of functional social degradation to utter entropic culture loss will quickly become seen as untenable and thus unacceptable to whites living in mixed-ethny dominant populations over us.</p>
<p>But that is the way it will go becaue things like the switch to a green-electric economy (renewables) and advanced medical and social programs to benefit our best and brightest as an investment in ourselves, will all be hampered by raw numbers of high TFR ethnic breeders.</p>
<p>And fearful jealousy of our empowerment by those who do not think, conceptually, as we do.  And see the difference in everything we do.  Better.</p>
<p>Indeed, &#8216;what we want&rsquo; will not matter once we no longer have the numbers to dictate the policy directions our country will to move towards achieving.</p>
<p>Because black and hispanic incompetence will NOT be able to make up the &#8216;qualitative difference&rsquo; and while Indian and East Asians may have the skillsets, they will no more do so for any but their own benefit than the other races will.</p>
<p>America at that point will be a corpse savaged and pulled to pieces by scavengers.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances there will be no hope for whites fighting back against an enemy in our midst who outnumber us, ten to one.  But there may be a possibility of holding a line.  Indeed, if we fall to 30-35% of this country&rsquo;s mean population mass, we will still need AT LEAST a third of it&rsquo;s economic land mass to sustain our productivity and thereby some fragment of what once was.</p>
<p>Which is why we must stand ready to separate as the Western and Eastern Roman Empires did.  Taking care of less.  Vexillating no troops to other&rsquo;s problems.  Holding a line with ranked solidarity of purpose. </p>
<p>By comparison, anything which appeases or attempts to accomodate other racial group needs in trade for greater &#8216;participancy&rsquo; in USA politics as a whole is only a slow road to national (From Latin, &#8216;Nascere&rsquo;: to be born, NOT country but it&rsquo;s best peoples) suicide.</p>
<p>Here too, there is a lesson from the fall of Rome to be learned: When Attila strove to unite his peoples and become King Of All Huns, it was under the premise that no Hun would serve under other than his own hegemony.  While he lived, his people lived well.  When he died, his sons lost social cohesion and were ripped to pieces by the angry German subject peoples whom they had abused for decades.</p>
<p>I see in the modern day ethnic populations (especially Hispanics) many of those same traits.  In small numbers they are kind, deferential and politically indifferent.  Once they have numeric majority, they act as a dominant group.  And once they have us under their thumb, there will never be a Nedao for whites.  Nor will they accept division from us.</p>
<p>We must preempt them and form a white-exclusive homeland.  </p>
<p>Quickly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br/>
Race isn&rsquo;t everything; enjoy the outdoors. <br/>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Race IS everything in this country because we are the ONLY &#8216;proposition nation&rsquo; on the planet worth being members of as a First World state with first world economic and social protections for its individual members.</p>
<p>Do not expect other racial groups, even nominally &#8216;intelligent&rsquo; ones, to pay attention to the environment as an enjoyable, renewable, beauty unto itself.  Open space to them is purely a commodity.</p>
<p>It has been so, throughout their histories and their runaway populations and total social entropy (2060: India- 3.2 billion; Africa- 2.7 billion; China 1.4 billion) prove their inherent genetic inability to conceive of long-horizon effects which are not Malthusian in outcome.</p>
<p>Only whites think of an empty place for our sons and daughters to live beyond us.  Only whites want them to have our inheritance as their constant.  Only whites ACKNOWLEDGE that science trumps religion in proving that privilege belongs to quality and not numbers as &#8216;social justice&rsquo;.</p>
