<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Enrollments at the nation&rsquo;s historically black colleges and universities remain at the highest level in history. According to U.S. Department of Education data, there were 322,789 students enrolled at HBCUs in 2009, the latest year complete data is available. Enrollments increased 3 percent from 2008 to 2009 and are up 17 percent since the turn of the century.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the 322,789 students enrolled in HBCUs, 264,090, or 81.8 percent, are black. In 2000, blacks made up 82.4 percent of the total enrollments at HBCUs. As far back at 1980, blacks were 81.8 percent of the total enrollments at HBCUs, the same percentage that exists today. Yes, there are HBCUs which have significantly increased their white enrollments. But, despite numerous press reports to the contrary, in general the &#8220;whitening of black colleges&#8221; is simply a myth.</p>

		<p>Wait!  For true diversity, you need asians and latinos and arabs enrolling in the black colleges.  I betcha that social justice advocates never thought of that!  We need to make them aware of the lack of true diversity at black colleges.</p>

		<p>I guess I have to wonder what self-respecting white person would WANT to go to a predominantly black college.  I&rsquo;d be driven crazy in short order by the way they all seem to chew gum like cows, not to mention their other nasty behavior. </p>

		<p>Actually, I know a few Whites who attended Black colleges on full scholarships. Two of them are professos at very good colleges and the othersl have very good jobs and are doing quite well. Go figure. </p>

		<p>Just what is the significance of this article supposed to be?</p>
<p>I suppose that we&rsquo;re expected to celebrate the increased attendance at these black grievance indoctrination centers.</p>
<p>None of these graduates has any great chance of finding a real job in the private (productive) sector.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;ll still be prefentially hired by the federal and state governments, rendering these already useless bodies even more useless.</p>

<p> Yes don&rsquo;t worry yourselves now, those crackers aren&rsquo;t going to take over OUR colleges. I wish the &#8220;blackening&#8221; of White colleges was simply a myth.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because when HBCU&rsquo;s do reach out it is usually to students in foreign countries. </p>

		<p>I like the name of the publication. It sounds like an oxymoron - THE JOURNAL OF BLACKS IN HIGHER EDUCATION.</p>
<p>Anyway, seriously, it matters little how many &#8220;students&#8221; are enrolled in these HBCU schools. They are little more than holding pens for low IQ zulus - sort of like glorified middle schools. For having an enrollment of between a quarter and half a million pupils it is astonishing how little quality comes from these institutions, be it in faculty, research, or the graduates themselves.</p>
<p>Granted, it&rsquo;s no secret that these schools are jokes. My problem is that white tax dollars go to support these trash-bins of learning. Besides, I can think of NO reason for these places to even exist in a so-called &#8220;post-racial&#8221; world - other than to try and hide the fact of low black intellect from the general public. Sorry, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>  I think there are more whites attending black colleges in the blackbelt than before . It&rsquo;s a reflection of how desperate the the situation has become for some whites desiring a college education . Slots for white southerners in colleges expressly built for educating white southerners can be hard to come by . That said, I have James Meredeth on tape stating, &#8221; It was never about education, it was about bringing down the status quo.&#8221; To me, that says it all .  </p>

		<p>I have to agree with poster #3 (Grossed Out) I can&rsquo;t imagine any white voluntarily going to an all black college. In my profession I have plenty of opportunity to grade and edit the papers of undergraduates at a mostly white school. In general, the quality of their work  would make most people blush with embarrassment  &mdash;  I mean we&rsquo;re talking undergraduates who write like 8th graders; their basic knowledge of history, art, politics, their country and government are appalling. With blacks it&rsquo;s even five times worse. One can only imagine the amount of scholarship money that is being thrown out the window every year on so-called &#8220;students&#8221; who, in most cases, won&rsquo;t make it past their sophomore year. <br>

		<p>Here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, there is historically black Stillman College. Most of the white students enrolled there are baseball players. The team is essentially all white with only one or two black players. They have an excellent white coach and dominate the league they play in. In fact they advertise on television for prospective students who want to play baseball.</p>
<p>A degree from Stillman is not worth very much, but I don&rsquo;t think the baseball players care, they want a chance to go to the pros.</p>

		<p>My wife once taught at an historically black university. So many students flunked the first exam that she had to give it over.</p>
<p>At the end of the term, she had students she had never seen in class coming in and telling her they needed to pass the course because it was required before they went out to do their student teaching  &mdash;  they were to become teachers.</p>
<p>She flunked so many students that she was never asked to teach there again.</p>
<p>This was in 1970.</p>

		<p>To #3:  there are whites  &mdash;  luckily not many though  &mdash;  who don&rsquo;t have much choice other than to go to a black college (4-year HBCU, or 2-year minority-dominated community college).  If you have flunked out of a 4-year school, this is where you get stuck.  Almost no 4-year colleges other than HBCUs will admit a flunk-out as a transfer student.  Yes it&rsquo;s cruel and not all rational, given the numerous reasons why a person may fail a semester or two.  But it&rsquo;s the way the system works now.  Do a google on (&#8220;flunk out&#8221; college) to see how bad things are; in particular, look at College Confidential and similar comment sites.  </p>
<p>The hippie days are gone.  Flunking out is now on a par with having a criminal felony record or a dishonorable discharge from the army. <br>

		<p>West Virginia State University and Bluefield State College, both in WV, are both HBCUs that are now about 80% white. I think select cases like that are where most of the &#8220;whitening&#8221; data comes from. </p>
