			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mandla Khoza, News24 (South Africa), May 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A trial date is expected to be set on Thursday for 12 people arrested in connection with setting a pastor alight after accusing him of using a magic penis to sleep with women.</p>
<p>The nine men and three women, aged between 28 and 50 will appear in the Boschfontein periodical court in Mpumalanga on charges murder and arson.</p>
<p>The villagers, among them a community induna (headman), were arrested on February 24 after Albert Malwane, a pastor of the Izwi Zion Christian Church, was burnt to death a day before.</p>
<p>Mpumalanga police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said that Malwane had been dragged from his one-roomed house in the Etitandini informal settlement near Jeppes Reef south of Malalane and taken to a hill, where he was set alight. </p>
<p>Malwane&rsquo;s house was also burnt and his wife and daughter went into hiding.</p>
<p>Community members had accused him of talking to animals and using an invisible penis to sleep with women in the informal settlement.</p>
<p>They also accused his wife of turning into a snail and terrorising the community. </p>
<p>The villagers also complained that Malwane&rsquo;s family had used muti to make then sick after Malwane&rsquo;s death. </p>
<p>One of the accused had to be carried into the Boschfontein periodical court when the 12 appeared in court on April 8.</p>
<p>Timothy Malwane, the father of the deceased, believes a curse was released at the pastor&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>The 12 accused have not been asked to plead.<br>

		<p>The truly sad thing is people just like this are imported into the USA daily. Our society is so dumbed-down now it&rsquo;s just sickening. The mind of a child and the body and urges of an adult, a sad combo.</p>

		<p><i>&hellip;his one-roomed house in the Etitandini informal settlement&hellip;</i><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>For those not current on their PC vocabulary, &#8220;informal settlement&#8221; is the term currently used by the MSM and international left for &#8220;squatter camp&#8221; or &#8220;shanty town&#8221;.  The &#8220;one-roomed house&#8221; is your typical slum shack made from scrap lumber, corrugated tin and plastic tarps.  These &#8220;informal settlements&#8221; usually have no running water, sewage or garbage pick-up.  </p>
<p>Many 3rd world countries are plagued with &#8220;informal settlements&#8221; that spring up on open land almost overnight.  Particularly in South Africa, refugees from more chaotic countries (such as Zimbabwe) will flood parks, beaches, nature preserves and even land surrounding airports.  Once they&rsquo;ve constructed a tiny shack, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to remove the invaders because they&rsquo;re protected by the UN under international law.</p>
<p>The encroachment of &#8220;informal settlements&#8221; is no excuse for the murder of this preacher, of course.  But it&rsquo;s good for Amren readers to know the new code word for squatter camp&hellip;because they&rsquo;ll start springing up in the United States within the next 20 years <b>guaranteed</b>.  </p>
<p>It will probably start in California, with plastic tarp shacks erected in state parks.  Hispanic activists and liberals will prevent anyone from leveling the new slums out of pity for the &#8220;hardworking immigrants&#8221;.  Then, once the liberals warm up to their new diverse &#8220;informal settlers&#8221;, the whole South West will start filling with Haiti-style squatter camps with raw sewage rivulets and loose goats.  </p>
<p>You heard it here first!  <br>

		<p>According to Gedaliah Braun&rsquo;s book, advertised on this site&rsquo;s left side as &#8220;Amazing New Book About Africa&#8221;, the majority of blacks in Africa believe they are better off under white rule.  They are frightened into voting for black thugs because of threats that the latter know, by magical means, who voted how.  <br>
Parts of Africa have descended into savagery, and others are headed there as ruthless blacks assume total power.  <br>
This book is a real page-turner and should be read by all interested in race realism.</p>

		<p>As Oscar Wilde states, &#8220;Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life&#8221;.  &#8220;Results not merely from Life&rsquo;s imitative instinct, but from the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise that energy.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Here are some insightful lyrics from &#8220;Magic Stick&#8221; by 50 Cent featuring Lil Kim:</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll show you magic<br>
(What? What?) Magic (uh huh uh huh)<br>

		<p>Where does one obtain a magical penis?  I&rsquo;ve tried shopping online, and not even eBay has them.</p>
<p>Where the wife is concerned, why a snail?  To quote the Simon &amp; Garfunkel song, I&rsquo;d rather be a sparrow than a snail.  Being able to fly would seem to offer much more potential for &#8220;terrorizing&#8221;.</p>
