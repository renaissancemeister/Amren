			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Shellnutt, Houston Chronicle, June 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Wednesday, the Southern Baptist Convention adopted a resolution supporting government efforts to provide paths to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and pledged that churches work toward just treatment of people regardless of legal status, Baptist News reported.</p>
<p>White evangelicals, a category that includes many Southern Baptists, don&rsquo;t generally take a positive position on undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. They are three times more likely to say &#8220;better border security&#8221; should be the focus of the immigration issue than they are to prioritize &#8220;creating a path to citizenship,&#8221; according to research by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.</p>
<p>Despite concerns that the resolution supported amnesty, Southern Baptist leaders defended a more open stance toward immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The text of the approved resolution reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote>RESOLVED, That we ask our governing authorities to implement, with the borders secured, a just and compassionate path to legal status, with appropriate restitutionary measures, for those undocumented immigrants already living in our country.
<p>RESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention &hellip; call on our churches to be the presence of Christ, in both proclamation and ministry, to all persons, regardless of country of origin or immigration status &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; RESOLVED, That we deplore any bigotry or harassment against any persons, regardless of their country of origin or legal status &hellip;<br>
</blockquote><br>
The language of the first clause was so controversial that the vote split  51.31 percent in favor and 48.43 percent opposed. The convention ended up adding the clause &#8220;this resolution is not to be construed as support for amnesty for any undocumented immigrant.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Southern Baptist Convention seems to be taking the same road downward as my own beloved Episcopal Church. <br>
 <br>
By the 1990s the second most famous Episcopalian in the United States after George H.W. Bush was Bishop Shelby Spong, of the Diocese of Newark, New Jersey. <br>
 <br>
After writing a number of books condemning the Bible, and arguing that Americans place too much emphasis on chastity he acknowledged that he did not believe in God. <br>
 <br>
Although he argued that Christianity had to adopt his beliefs or cease to exist, his diocese lost half of its members while he was bishop.  </p>

<p>Restitutionary measures?  Just what the heck is that supposed to mean?</p>

Who gets the restitution?  We do, or they do?</p>

		<p>From the longer AP version of the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The resolution [advocating citizenship for 12-15 million illegal aliens] was one of several signs at this year&rsquo;s meeting that the SBC, which has been declining in membership and baptisms in recent years, sees ethnic diversity as one of the keys to a turnaround.&#8221;</p>
<p>COMMENT: The same &#8220;declining in membership&#8221; propels the Catholic church&rsquo;s push for amnesty for illegal aliens. The churches like labor unions look to offset declining white membership by betting on demographic trends favoring Hispanics.  The pernicious effects of mass third world immigration on whites   &mdash;  - church members or union members or not   &mdash;  - does not concern churches or unions.</p>

<p>The resolution is completely incoherent.  If they want to reward law breakers, they should just say so, without any back pedaling.</p>
<p>Mexico is the only country on earth that makes territorial claims against the United States.  It is suicidal to let so many Mexicans into this country.</p>

		<p>This together with the recent appointment of an Afro vice president to the Southern Baptists raises some very complex issues that are affecting the whole of the Christian Church as we know it.</p>
<p>50 years ago most mainstream churches (here and the USA) would have had 99% white congregations including all the pillars of the local and national establishment, the political outlook of the churches then was mainly very conservative. In our innocence we all condemned aparthied in South Africa and the general thrust of church mission work was directed at the 3rd world.</p>
<p>Now come back to the present: We have as church leaders the likes of Jesse Jackson, Desmont Tutu from South Africa, The Afro Bishop of York who is No.2 in the UK chuch hierarchy and firebrand anti-white preacher Jerimiah Wright who was Obama&rsquo;s mentor. Mainstream churches in white anglo areas are really struggling now to maintain a congregation and then when a 3rd world priest or minister is appointed many whites simply leave. We have liberal churches preaching accommodation with Islam. We also have many of 3rd world/black/ethnic churches which exist in parallel whith the traditional mainstream churches.</p>
<p>The point of all of this, where and what is the moral authority of the church to either declare racism (whatever that is) a sin or to dictate immigration policy either here in Australia or  in the USA.</p>
<p>I am involved with the Church, I also despair with what is happening in and to the Church.<br>

		<p>Like the mainline Protestant denominations who have been bleeding members for years because their elites decided to embrace the dogmas of politically correctness, the southern Baprtists now seem intent driving their parishoners away also. I know we shouldn&rsquo;t be criticizing tradional Western religions on here, but when you have the mainline protestans, the Catholics and now the Southern Baptists determined to flood the country with third world government dependant peasants, I can&rsquo;t help but conclude that Western civilization and Christianity need to part ways.</p>

		<p>I, a Christian, do not agree with the way Christian leaders try to involve themselves in liberal politics. Churches should be about God, not politics.</p>
<p>Our founding fathers were very wise men. They understood why there ought to be separation of church and state. Whenever churches start to involve themselves in secular affairs, they cease being about God and instead become secular.</p>

		<p>Their membership is down and so they pull this stunt. The only thing this will accomplish will be to chase away their remaining members. It won&rsquo;t happen overnight. But I guarantee that in 10 years their membership will have decreased by 20%.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to advise the Southern Baptists to do the same thing I&rsquo;ve advised the Catholics. Don&rsquo;t leave. Just stop paying tithes. And tell them WHY you&rsquo;ve stopped tithing. Instead, organize a conservative faction among the members and give your tithes to them. You&rsquo;re going to have to organize it outside of the official Church leadership and they&rsquo;re not going to like that. But do it anyway. Your only other option is to surrender your Church.</p>

I agree with that.  As Tom S. pointed out, if these Southern  churches (especially the black ones) want to engage in politics more  than religion, then they should lose their tax-exempt status and be registered as political lobbying groups, which is what many of them really are. </p>

		<p>Upon reading the resolutions I can&rsquo;t help but feel warm and fuzzy all over. </p>
<p>But then my frontal lobe concedes to rational thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing warm and fuzzy about violent gangs. The increased Hispanic community will command more tax dollars to educate children with lower IQs. Welfare roles will swell with under-educated Hispanics. Hispanics living in Mexico and other economically depressed regions will be encouraged to immigrate to escape the economies of their own making. </p>
<p>I no longer feel warm and fuzzy. I feed sick.</p>

<p>They remind me of the Pharisees who conspired to Crucify Christ, with the proviso, &#8216;It is better for one man to die, than that the nation perish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the translation for today is, &#8216;It is better for the White Man to Perish off the face of the Earth, than that the multicultural Obamanation should perish.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I would equate this bunch with the Republican Party: simply trying to placate and pander to the minorities and hoping the minorities, eventually, support them.  And the Southern Baptists wonder why their enrollment is failing and dwindling and in decline?<br>
  <br>
Years ago, I remember miscegenation being preached as a sin from the pulpit in a Southern Baptist church.  If such a sermon was so &ldquo;right&rdquo; years ago, why would the same sermon be so &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; this day and age?  Answer: They have fallen for the ruse of multiculturalism and political correctness.  Unfortunately, this group, as well as many other religious organizations, has sold out and betrayed the European American/European person.  I recently read an article, in a Southern Baptist publication, stating that revival will come to America through the Native American population.  Now, can one imagine the same article stating, revival will come to America through the European American/European population?  When a church becomes politically correct, it is time to seek another (and, good luck on the quest).                    <br>

		<p>Why is it that White institutions do such things, but non-white institutions do not?  I don&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a black church actively recruiting White or Hispanic members.  <br>
It is a curious experiment where people of like-minded beliefs and behaviors recruit outside that shared commonality, and actual expect to maintain the legacy that binds them.  Or maybe they don&rsquo;t think about such things.  Isn&rsquo;t it enough to have open doors to anyone who shares their beliefs attend at will?</p>

		<p>@ poster #4 - I can only hope that by restitutionary measures they mean restitution to the US taxpayers.  </p>
<p>I heartily despise &#8220;social gospel&#8221; in all its forms, but this is truly sickening.  The Biblical model of the church is of a group of believers helping each other, not taking up social causes.  Since when does the Church encourage breaking just laws and stealing money from the pockets of hard working taxpayers?  The sooner the SBC self-destructs, the better!   </p>

<p>I think I know pretty well how our media and educational institutions became subverted&hellip;who principally did it and why&hellip;but the churches are a bit of a mystery. I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t have to have been an actual &#8220;takeover&#8221; like happened with the academy and the media&hellip;once those two institutions as well as a large part of government and finance were in the right hands, it would be hard for any large institution to function in a contrary manner.</p>
<p>There are Christians I&rsquo;m sure who know some details of what happened and have some pieces of the puzzle. What pressures were brought to bear, from outside the churches and inside them?</p>

		<p>The problem is not Christianity but organized religion.  These &#8220;churches&#8221; have become transnational corporations and should pay taxes as the rest of us do.</p>
<p>I occasionally go to a Catholic church near me because I like the priest, but I don&rsquo;t give more than a couple of bucks.  Not because I don&rsquo;t want to share, but because I object to their collaboration in white race replacement and helping to bring down American wages to global levels.  Whether the do-gooders know it or not, they are only benefiting the globalist corporations and bringing the 3rd world here, not uplifting the 3rd world.</p>

<p>You seem to pose a question here, even though you did not use a question mark, so I will offer my thoughts on this issue as one response.</p>
<p>To the first; Christianity is an all inclusive religion from the start.  When the Jews &#8220;rejected&#8221; Paul&rsquo;s version of it, he turned to &#8220;Gentiles&#8221; -  non-Jews.  He preached universal witness and universal conversion, the open access of all humanity to the forgiveness of sins and the gift of everlasting life, if they believed in Jesus Christ as their savior.  Early converts were highly diverse, this is well known.  Through the centuries, Christianity was along for the ride when the New World was discovered and the natives converted - forcibly in many cases.  Missions from China to Africa have extended the original intent of Paul for world wide inclusion.  So if Christianity is not automatically adverse to any sort of discriminatory practices against any member or potential member, regardless of race or location, then it is up to Christian scholars to explain how that is represented in the Bible and then in the historical precedent of Christianity.</p>
<p>The second part seems to propose that if Christianity could justify racial exclusiveness for whites, then it might be able to also dictate immigration policies favorable to whites.  OR, it might be that if they are using the former principle of Christian universalism, they are becoming politically involved by forcing immigration trends on the State.</p>
<p>The truth is that throughout its history, Christian leaders have always been able to mold their contemporary interpretation of Christianity with necessity, as they saw it.  Today, they appear to need lots of third world immigrants to survive.  So they will find the moral right somewhere to do it.  It will happen, unless the State steps in and forbids them.  That would a political battle that I at least would find very interesting to witness.</p>
<p>If religions were to loose their tax exempt status, it would be possible to tax them for example, providing immigration services and counseling.  That might slow it down a bit.</p>

		<p>Yes, very sad to see the top of another formerly White European Church go over to the enemy camp. The holier than though high church folks are now working to destroy our people. That&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>But some good news in a complete opposite area:</p>
<p>Immigration patriot porn star Miss Ginger Lee has successful taken down NY Rep Weiner - rated F on immigration by NumbersUSA.</p>
<p>Miss Ginger is a beautiful woman and she&rsquo;s not all hung up with corrupt Church doctrines and is willing to get down and dirty and take down a real, nasty enemy of our people: NY Congressman Weiner - who went so far as to marry a really ugly, nasty Muslim woman!</p>
<p>Check out their pictures (no need to worry folks, these images of Miss Lee are all rated PG)  Weiner and his nasty, ugly NW wife really present the truth of who is against us.</p>

People could question their pastors on this issue.  If they give the wrong answer, let them know that you are seeking a new church.  Upon moving to a new church, repeat the same question.  If the pastor gives the wrong answer again tell him you are leaving his church because he is not a patriot.  This will surely cause a buzz through the church leadership.  We don&rsquo;t have to be victims, we can take the initiative.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think I know pretty well how our media and educational institutions became subverted&hellip;who principally did it and why&hellip;but the churches are a bit of a mystery.

<p>The originators of a cult, religion, or secular ideology do not have to go out themselves and preach to the masses.  Once started, they have disciples to do  that grunt work.  And the disciples have more disciples, all brainwashed and fired up  with  newfound zeal for spreading The Truth to the unenlightened masses.</p>
<p>Thus, Saint Augustine of  Canterbury, an Italian, became Apostle to the English.  And St. Patrick, a Briton, became Apostle to the Irish. And St. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon, became Apostle to the Germans. St. James, Apostle to Spain. And so on.</p>
<p>Or, more recently, in a different (but similar) context, Margaret Mead, a disciple of Franz Boaz, himself a disciple of Karl Marx,  became apostle to the Americans!  And so on&hellip;.</p>
<p>We are still reeling from the results.</p>

		<p>Or churches want to be a chapter in Foxes Book of Martyrs.  They will gladly commit sit down national suicide if is not them who will pay the price of their folly.  it is natural for the Catholic Church to support Hispanic immigration since they are mostly Catholic.  For other churches to support the low key invasion of our country by foreign peoples they have other reasons to do this.  Many people have a false concept that being a Christian means you have to suffer and to give away that which you have worked to obtain.  Masochistic tendencies are not Christian.  Giving away in effect your home and your culture is not Christian it is mental illness.   You can be very sure that you will not get the same response in return from the illegals.  They are here to get all they can get including the very land under your feet</p>

		<p>My former church was absolutely obsessed with statistics on how many people attended church at each service offered during the week.  Apparently, pastors who want to be &#8220;called&#8221; to serve at a bigger church need to show that they are &#8220;dynamic&#8221; and that they are catalysts for church growth in order to be considered the kind of go-getter that all of the churches with stagnant membership rolls want to hire.</p>
<p>The fastest and easiest way for a pastor to boost his statistics is to start an &#8220;Hispanic Outreach&#8221; or offer to be the host church for a bunch of African refugees, etc.  As long as the white people in the pews are furnishing clothing, disposable diapers, free formula, free furniture, free household goods, free legal and medical and dental help, along with a free translation service, and the volunteer labor of educated white people filling out all kinds of applications for free stuff from other giveaway programs, and visa paperwork for their extended families, etc., and networking with other churches to fill in any possible gap that might be left over, the church will be full of these people, who are the ultimate &#8220;rice Christians.&#8221;  If the gravy train ever stops delivering, they will move on to another church, but until then, they don&rsquo;t mind coming every Sunday if they get a couple of grocery bags of free food, and maybe some diapers.</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to see the energy the pastors and their wives put into finding a ride and a translator to take Umjumboo and her five kids to some government office or another, when they don&rsquo;t EVER ask the elderly people in the congregation who have been volunteering and donating for 50 years if THEY need help with rides or yardwork or home repairs or paying for an expensive prescription.  </p>
<p>My mother pesters me all the time about not attending church, and I would like to start going again, but I want to attend a church that isn&rsquo;t a gigantic &#8220;gibs me dat&#8221; program for transient freeloaders.</p>
<p>Those who have posted that the pastors are hoping for money in the collection plate from immigrants are mistaken.  The pastors KNOW that the immigrants will be a net drain FOREVER.  (They may put $5 in the collection plate, but then enroll all of their children in the church-supported school.  Once you have immigrants in the congregation, they suck up all the available scholarship funds in the school.)  The pastors are focused on head count, and they trust that Whitey won&rsquo;t be so racist as to drop out of church because of the newcomers.  For the most part, they seem to get away with it.</p>

		<p>When I was growing up, attending Catholic religious instruction, we were taught that <i> &#8220;Holy Mother Church never changes&#8221;.</i></p>
<p>That is not true!  The churches change their stripes every few  decades with the shifting  intellectual and political fashions.</p>
<p><br>
As WR Elder has said:<br>
I note that &ldquo;Christian principles&rdquo; seem to change with the political winds. Mark my words, in 20 years these churches  will express outrage at any laggard states that still forbid homosexual marriage. They will say that such laws violate Christian principles.</p>
<p><br>
Exactly so. And well said.</p>
<p>Do let us  note that these same churches supported and defended slavery for centuries, finding nothing wrong with it. Now, they consider &#8220;racism&#8221; the most evil sin.  How styles do change!</p>

		<p>It might be a good time to remind the AR community that in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe - the white Church leaders did the very same thing that these white Church leaders are now doing in America.  Betraying their own race and aiding the enemies of all White European people on this planet by advocating for open borders and for the racial and cultural dispossession of whites, no matter where on Earth we exist.  </p>
<p>In the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe - this betrayal resulted in the vicious, violent, brutal, horrific rapes, sadistic mutilations, castrations, torture, dismemberment, and eventually mass and very gruesome murders of thousands of White South Afrikaners, many of whom were stupidly loyal church attendees.  </p>
<p>Hence, here is a tip for every white man, woman and child:  If the preacher of your church, or if the so-called &#8216;leaders&rsquo; of your church or your religion are preaching white genocide, then you need to understand that these traitors are your mortal enemies and you need to disconnect yourself completely from that church or that religious baloney.    Do not let these Judas Goat rats dupe and mislead you like their white-genocide promoting cohorts did to the Whites in the former Rhodesia.   </p>
<p>Your racial tribe and it&rsquo;s survival is the #1 priority in your book of loyalty.  Never forget that, fellow AR readers.    <br>

		<p>To # 27, Thank you for your detailed response to my comment, and, yes I do need to take care of my grammar re question marks.</p>
<p>To # 23 Harumphty Dumpty: How exactly did the churches become so subverted? Are there any Christian old-timers here who experienced personally the transformation of some particular church?</p>
<p>I think the full answer to this question is way beyond the scope of a simple reply on Amren, but I have been round long enough to see it all happen. I think it would be also quite reasonable to say that the decline of  Western Values has paralled the decline of the (mainstream) churches.</p>
<p>I think this anecdote is relevant: When President Clinton was having trouble with a certain young lady at the White House and it was on the news every night, my wife made the following comment: &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t that nice, President Clinton has confessed his sins to the Rev. Jesse Jackson.&#8221; (help!)</p>
<p>All I can say is that JJ does not represent any of the values I expect to find in the Church. I have seen the Church here in Australia go from a well attended organisation which back in the 60s supported the Viet-Nam war effort to protect us from the communists as well as the &#8220;yellow Peril&#8221; to a poorly attended organisation that now supports every loony left cause from feminism to open door immigration policies.(Especially to anyone who is not white, not Christian and does not speak English.)</p>
<p>I fail to see how the Church has any brief to dictate immigration policy.</p>
<p>PS. It is refugee Action week here in Australia, I don&rsquo;t think we will see the words &#8220;Illegal Immigrants&#8221; or &#8220;People Smugglers&#8221; get much air time.</p>

https://tinyurl.com/3vve267</p>
<p>I was unaware of the role the churches played in bringing about this catastrophe, but it seems entirely consistent with their finger-in-the-wind response to political realities.</p>
<p>Mugabe and the White African covers what happened in Zimbabwe after it was too late.  It describes what happened to white farmers, one in particular, Mike Campbell, who tried to stay on after blacks took control.</p>
