			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, June 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An alleged member of the Maniac Latin Disciples gang was charged on Friday for the shooting of two young girls in a Northwest Side park, as the new head of the Chicago Police Department vowed revenge against his gang.</p>
<p>Antonio Bucio, 22, allegedly got out of a van near the park and fired on a group of people playing basketball. Stray bullets hit two girls ages two and seven playing in a nearby sandbox around 8 p.m. on Wednesday. The younger girl suffered a grazing wound to her head, and the older one was hit in the upper back.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police will begin arrests of MLD gang members on whatever charges they can find: drugs, gun possession, even outstanding warrants. The move is part of the CPD&rsquo;s overall anti-gang strategy, initiated by previous superintendent Jody Weis, to use heavy enforcement of even the pettiest of crimes to disrupt a gang&rsquo;s day-to-day operations after it commits an act of violence. Ultimately, the goal is to create an anti-violence norm within the gang, convincing gang members that senseless violence is bad for business.</p>

<p>Why did it have to take the shooting of two innocent little girls before they started this? Seems to me this is what they should have been doing all along. Now two small children are injured  &mdash;  one seriously, by the sounds of it. More than past time to start heavy enforcement. </p>

		<p>CPD is a joke.</p>
<p>Cop got run over last light doing a DUI check.</p>
<p>There is no Traffic Law enforced in downtown Chicago, and hasn&rsquo;t been for at least 12 years   &mdash;   unless you are a cab driver ( I am not and have no affiliation )   &mdash;   and you wonder why the first time somebody gets checked he guns it (when he is going to be facing jail for something he has probably done every night for the last few years).</p>

<p>An alleged member of the Maniac Latin Disciples gang&hellip;</p>
<p>So they flat-out CALL themselves a &#8220;Latin&#8221; &#8220;gang&#8221; and yet to form a stereotype in your head that <i>some of these Latinos are a menace</i> is somehow a cause for shame on the part of decent white people.</p>

<p>Please tell me this is a joke!!! The goal is to make a violence-free gang??? They must have a lot of idiots working for the CPD.</p>

		<p><i>&hellip;as [Gerry McCarthy] vowed revenge against his gang.</i></p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to eschew revenge and retribution?</p>
<p><i>Police will begin arrests of MLD gang members on whatever charges they can find: drugs, gun possession, even outstanding warrants.</i></p>
<p>Begin?  Why haven&rsquo;t they been doing that all along?</p>
<p><i>The move is part of the CPD&rsquo;s overall anti-gang strategy, initiated by previous superintendent Jody Weis, to use heavy enforcement of even the pettiest of crimes to disrupt a gang&rsquo;s day-to-day operations after it commits an act of violence. </i></p>
<p>Look at how well it worked.</p>
<p><i>Ultimately, the goal is to create an anti-violence norm within the gang, convincing gang members that senseless violence is bad for business.</i></p>
<p>A non-violent gang is like non-wet water.  The raison d&rsquo;etre of a gang, as we have come to understand the concept, is the use of violence for some purpose, the protection of drug dealing territory being the most common purpose.</p>

		<p>One more thing that&rsquo;s bugging me:</p>
<p><i>&hellip;senseless violence&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Fail.  I&rsquo;m getting tired of that phrase being bandied about like a bon mot.  This isn&rsquo;t &#8220;senseless,&#8221; it had a reason   &mdash;   Hispanic thug tried to mow down a rival playing basketball at a relatively long distance away, and shot two girls instead because he&rsquo;s apparently not that good a shot, or the intended target was too far away.  Too, I&rsquo;m tired of this &#8220;stray bullet&#8221; business:  It&rsquo;s simple physics:  Bullets fired from a gun just don&rsquo;t spontaneously change direction.  These two girls just happened to be in between shooter and target.  If I&rsquo;m the CPD investigator on this case, I&rsquo;d look at the intended victim, and also if there are any state laws which I could use to arrest them   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re probably the same kind of hoods and thugs as Mr. Bucio.</p>

		<p>I know Antonio aka tone. Idk why he did and am sure he didn&rsquo;t mean to harm little girls . But you people need to stop lookinq at ganag members as if they were animals cus there not have u ever bothered to ask a gang member why they do what they do? I bet anything no . They do what they do cus it&rsquo;s all they know how to do they have No one to guide them. Ofcourse there&rsquo;s help put there pride won&rsquo;t let them get it. I know Antonio for many years and he&rsquo;s an amazinq individual . What made him do this? No one knows by all mean I am not agreeing with what he did . But I ask If you don&rsquo;t know him don&rsquo;t judge him. As for the innoccent litlle qirls that have no fault. My prayers go out to u and your familys. I hope your guys pull trew</p>
