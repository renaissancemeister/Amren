<h1><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/06/21/drowning-risk-high-for-new-immigrants-children-report/">Drowning Risk High for New Immigrants, Children: Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Derek Abma, National Post, June 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Summer officially arrived Tuesday, and with it the increased risk of drownings as Canadians increasingly take to the water to cool off.</p>
<p>Data released Tuesday by the Lifesaving Society, a charitable organization, suggest drownings in Canada have become more frequent in recent years.</p>
<p>Children younger than five and new Canadians are specifically at a greater risk of drowning, the group&rsquo;s data suggest.</p>
<p>The group said drownings had been in long-term decline until 2004, when there were a total of 433 drownings, the lowest on record. That number rose to 492 in 2005; to 508 in 2006; and to 480 in 2007.</p>
<p>Official figures for the most recent years aren&rsquo;t available from chief coroners and medical examiners. However, the Lifesaving Society said, based on initial emergency calls, the trend of more drownings has continued.</p>
<p>It said reported drownings were up 10% in 2010 from the year before.</p>
<p>For children younger than five, reported drownings totallled 22 last year, up from 14 in 2009, the group said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drowning is the second leading cause of death among children, and the reality is that it can happen very quickly, in as little as 10 seconds,&#8221; Barbara Byers, public education director for the Lifesaving Society, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parents and caregivers should always stay within sight and two feet of young children when near water. Anything further away than two feet is not within arms&rsquo; reach, and it is simply not safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last years saw a rash of summer drownings, including several children in back yard pools.</p>
<p>The organization also pointed out a study it did last year showing people who have lived in Canada for five years or less are four times more likely to not know how to swim than longer-term residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over and over again, we heard from our focus group members that swimming was a very Canadian thing to do,&#8221; said Ms. Byers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many said swimming pools and beaches were not easily accessible for them in their home country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many said swimming pools and beaches were not easily accessible for them in their home country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
All the more reason for these NuCanadians to take EXTRA care when their children are around water, no? </p>
<p>Instead, their drowning fatalities suggest NuCanadian parents take LESS care. A lackadaisical attitude that allows their children to go under for the third time without their parents noticing they&rsquo;re gone until it&rsquo;s too late. Not sure what these Third World parents are doing instead, but whatever it is, it&rsquo;s apparently more important to them than keeping an eye on their brood in the public pool. </p>
<p>Either that or the white man&rsquo;s old friend H2O is a secret racist. </p>

		<p>In the world&rsquo;s most populous country, China, most don&rsquo;t know how to swim either because the waters are polluted with industrial waste or because swimming is considered a frivolous pastime.</p>
<p>This is our children&rsquo;s future under globalized immigration.</p>

		<p>If that is true then give every illegal alien a free pool pass and pay them money to go to swimming pools.</p>

		<p>Yes it is all the guilt ridden white liberals fault. They are the one bring the laws suits that forces private pools to be open to the public. They have no concern whether immigration children can swim or not, just as long as they have access to the pools.</p>

<p>NOT ONLY are pools not accessible they are not even there period. There is not such a thing as pool life and beach life and taking your clothes off and swimming, etc. That sort of activity is mostly confined to the western world period.</p>

		<p>The notorious sanitation habits of these imported creatures has forced me to abandon all swimming venues except family and friends&rsquo; pools.</p>
<p>Every summer 5-6 drownings are reported at Lake Lanier near Atlanta. Every time we hear a report, the hubby and I quickly take bets on whether it&rsquo;s a Jose or Quantavious. Normally, the lake drownings are Jose and the local swimming pool deaths are Quantavious. Although, a recent six hour long rescue operation that required blasting the concrete deck of an apartment complex pool was brought about by a Maria Sanchez Gonzales-type child. They had to remove her arm from a drain which she had stuck her arm into beyond the elbow. </p>
