			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patricia Cohen, New York Times, June 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was less than 20 years ago that the National Institutes of Health abruptly withdrew funds for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/15/science/new-storm-brews-on-whether-crime-has-roots-in-genes.html">a conference on genetics and crime</a> after outraged complaints that the idea smacked of eugenics. The president of the Association of Black Psychologists at the time declared that such research was in itself &#8220;a blatant form of stereotyping and racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}A small cadre of experts is exploring how genes might heighten the risk of committing a crime and whether such a trait can be inherited.    </p>
<p>The turnabout will be evident on Monday at the annual National Institute of Justice conference in Arlington, Va. On the opening day criminologists from around the country can attend a panel on creating databases for information about DNA and &#8220;new genetic markers&#8221; that forensic scientists are discovering.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Researchers estimate that at least 100 studies have shown that genes play a role in crimes. {snip}</p>
<p>One gene that has been linked to violence regulates the production of the monoamine oxidase A enzyme, which controls the amount of serotonin in the brain. People with a version of the gene that produces less of the enzyme tend to be significantly more impulsive and aggressive, but, as Ms. Moffitt and her colleague (and husband) Avshalom Caspi discovered, the effect of the gene is triggered by stressful experiences. </p>

There is more and more information concerning this topic coming to light. Of course it is still a serious offense to acknowledge differences in races. But eventually it will lose its stigma. Is this good news or bad news?? How long before blacks successfully use the &#8220;genetic defense&#8221; in a court of law, claiming they aren&rsquo;t responsible for whatever violent crime they committed because they are genetically predisposed to commit violent crimes??</p>

		<p>Seems to me I read about this more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Something about a double male gene?  It was said that criminals could be identified as early as kindergarten and the same objections were raised then as now.</p>
<p>Same idea as the struggle over scores on the College Board Tests. Scores on these exams were demonstrably the best way to predict success in college.</p>
<p>Same idea as the Federal Employment Entrance Exam or the PACE exam that college grads once took to enter Government service.  They were found discriminatory and, last time I looked, a general written test for college grads was done away with. </p>
<p>Then came &#8220;race norming&#8221; on tests and then outright racial quotas.</p>
<p>I read in Instauration magazine around 30 years ago that the Air Force Academny discriminated against white men.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, so I called the Pentagon and was allowed to speak to a public affairs officer of the Air Force.  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, the Air Force Academny does discriminate because if it did not, there would be no blacks at the Academny and blacks have the same right to be represented as anyone else.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Lysenkoism in Soviet Russia and the Hobson vs. Hansen dispute in the D.C. public schools over different academic &#8220;tracks&#8221; for students with different aptitudes nearly half a centry ago.</p>

		<p>Studies in Iowa, Sweden, and Denmark have indicated that identical twins are more likely to be similar in criminal behavior than fraternal twins. These studies have also indicated a stronger correlation in adopted children between felony convictions among the biological parents and the biological children than between the adopted children and their adoptive parents.    <br/>

In the Soviet Union in 1959 scientists captured wild rats and divided them into two colonies. Rats in one colony were bred for tameness. Rats in the other colony were bred for ferocity. Currently the rats in the tame colony would make excellent pets. They love to be held and petted. The rats in the other colony hiss at the approach of a human. They violently resist being held. The environments for these rats are identical. The fact that tameness and ferocity can be influenced genetically has obvious implications for criminology. <br/>

		<p> Good to see that they are willing to look   &mdash;   somewhat half-heartedly   &mdash;   at the genetic roots of criminality, violence, etc. But I notice that the writer takes two steps away from the genetic source, for every step she takes toward it. Typical of the New York Times.</p>
<p> The way the article is written reminds me of the famous one-armed economist that Harry Truman said he was looking for. He said economists always say, &#8220;On the one hand,&#8221; then, &#8220;but on the other hand.&#8221; Cohen does the same thing in this article. Heaven forbid that genetics should be pinpointed as the direct cause of much anti-social behavior. There is much backing and filling, much dragging in of &#8220;environment&#8221; that is allegedly the &#8220;trigger&#8221; which fires the genetic gun.</p>
<p> I also notice that she manages to avoid mentioning race, anywhere in the article. Typical liberal refusal to face the truth, even when it&rsquo;s staring them in the face.</p>

		<p>Those who believe that economic deprivation causes crime must account for James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein&rsquo;s portrait of an urban community that has suffered severe poverty but little crime. During the 1960s, San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown had the city&rsquo;s lowest income, highest unemployment rate and highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 a year. Yet in 1965, the authors note, there were only five people of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s really all you need to remember. This &#8220;study&#8221; might very well be an exercise in political correctness with a foregone conclusion: <i>&#8220;We did the tests and there&rsquo;s no proof whatsoever. So let&rsquo;s all go back to sleep&hellip;&#8221;</i> </p>
<p>And if by some miracle I am wrong, and definitive results are published that suggest a correlation between genetics and crime, then it will be soundly ignored, even aggressively squelched by the media, which will find some white perp like Casey Anthony to focus on. </p>

 <br/>
I can understand why the president of the Association of Black Psychologists, who probably owed his career to affirmative action, was uncomfortable with the topic. <br/>
 <br/>
As more is learned about genetics, it is becoming more apparent that the segregationists were right, after all. <br/>
 <br/>
I predict that the fall of political correctness will be as abrupt as the fall of the Soviet Union. For the first time since the 1960s it will be safe to tell the truth in public about the innate nature of racial differences.<br/>
 <br/>
Until then I shall remain on the lam from the Thought Police. </p>

		<p>&#8220;That the idea smacked of eugenics&hellip;&#8221; I once read a post &#8220;by someone who was there&#8221; that segregation was never about asserting cultural superiority of Whites over blacks. It was merely a political restraining order against criminality. That challenged my point of view. </p>
<p>  In a similar vein, I saw a post recently that Eugenics were forever tainted by an  association with The Nazis and World War II. A poster asked, &#8220;Why are advances in Rocket Science that were pioneered by the Nazis accepted, celebrated and built upon even today, while any discussion of the science of Eugenics contains a  poisonous whiff of Zyklon B?!?&#8221; Hmmmmm&hellip; </p>

		<p>The late and great psychologist from the UK, Hans Eysenck, formulated/ and re-formulated/ hypotheses a long time ago about<br/>
biological predispositions for criminal conduct-( e.g.,CRIME AND PERSONALITY ). The great breakthrough news at hand now is that  on campus USA, you&rsquo;re more likely to hear about this current news at a cocktail party among the Vet Med faculty or among the engineering faculty  than from  any lectern within the departments of psychology, sociology, education&hellip;<br/>

		<p>We need to club together and offer a $1,000,000 prize for any geneticist who will publish a solid peer reviewed paper which really shines light on the IQ deficit on blacks. Something no-holds-barred and completely unencumbered by politics, which can&rsquo;t be explained away by social science. It would have to be enough money to retire on after the obvious career-ending effect such a paper would have. Money always trumps politics. If 20,000 race realists agreed to pledge $50 each we&rsquo;d have a $1,000,000 challenge.</p>

 <br/>
The implication of a genetic predisposition to engage in crime is not toward leniency; it toward more and longer prison sentences. It is also probably toward harsher prison sentences, as deterrence may be the only thing that is effective toward those with crime genes.   <br/>
 <br/>
The implication is certainly against efforts at rehabilitation. This seldom works anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
If genes for crime can be identified the absence or presence of these genes in a convict will influence decisions by parole boards. </p>

		<p>It is interesting reading all of the comments.  I am white and of course noticed this way back in kindergarten.  Granted there are many blacks that don&rsquo;t have these problems with criminal behavior but unfortunately, this is a case of 99% giving the other 1 percent a bad name.</p>
<p>I think Thomas Sowell, Condi Rice, Bill Cosby and probably some others act better than most whites.  The problem is that these folks are in that 1% with IQs quite a bit higher than the white norm and vastly higher than the black norm. While these black people and those like them are able to function as productive members of society most blacks are rather anti-social.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is that they disproportionally use resources that they have not earned. Our society encourages it by not using any means to limit their reproduction. This generation of deadbeats and criminals is encouraged, through government subsidies and such to reproduce at an unbelievable rate.  Twenty years from now there are even more unproductive blacks and others (whites included) that will live of welfare and drain more resources that could be used for the betterment of the country.  </p>
<p>The country should encourage, through financial rewards, sterilization of those with substantially sub-par IQs.  Offer those with IQs below 85 or so $1,000 for each IQ point below this level who volunteer to be sterilized.  20 years later crime will drop, money spent on welfare and other social wastes will drop as well.  The country will, of course move back to being more white and Asian dominated but crime and misery will dwindle.  The blacks that make the cut and their descendants will not be subject to discrimination or at least very little discrimination.<br/>

		<p>This is a disturbing news report from Columbia, SC about a young man who was savagely beaten by a gang of 8 black youths.  Almost all of the violent crime in this city is done by blacks.  You rarely hear of whites involved in violent robbery or assaults.  It is common in the black community, especially the poorer ones.</p>
<p>An 18-year-old jogger was savagely beaten in an early Monday morning attack in Five Points. </p>
<p>Columbia Police believe surveillance video captured four of the eight suspects as they darted across the street toward the jogger, who had just jogged through and out of the camera&rsquo;s view, police spokeswoman Jennifer Timmons said. </p>
<p>The attack occurred in a parking lot on the 1900 block of Blossom Street at 12:15am Monday, police said in a statement. The young man was robbed of his cell phone and beaten. A passerby found the victim on Edisto Avenue two hours later and called 911. </p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s family told police that he required emergency brain surgery and will need facial reconstruction following the attack. </p>

		<p>I have first hand knowledge of how typical city blacks think and act.  I was one of the first white students to be integrated into a previously all black school during the failed social engineering experiment called desegregation back in the early 70&rsquo;s.  As a white 12 year old mixed with a large number of blacks, I saw why parents opposed desegregation so much.  The first thing that I noticed was that black kids were a lot bigger and stronger than the white ones.  They took notice of the difference and made our lives hell.  Blacks mature at a younger age than whites, a known fact.  They were constantly fighting each other, usually over trivial matters.  Most of it was in jest, trying to prove dominance over the others.  When it was real, knives were usually involved.  The stewards were noticeably absent or would overlook bullying or fights.  The biggest thing that I noticed was that they were incapable of learning the most basic of information.  The smarter ones were invariably pulled down by the morons.  I remember a particularly bright black child who was doing drugs by high school and acting like a typical black.  Most were incapable of graduating high school and only were able to do so with programs situated for their intelligence level.  Many were just passed off by the school board and were allowed to graduate without passing the most basic of studies.  </p>
<p>This was 40 years ago.  Not much has changed in this time and has only gotten worse.  It is no surprise to me that their choice of career is criminality.  Now granted, there are many successful black people, but they are a small minority of their race.</p>

		<p>As a teenager in the 80s, I attended a mostly white, suburban US high school. There was one Puerto Rican girl in my class. I have to admit, I found her both intelligent and decent. She was attractive as well. She often told me all about her life in Puerto Rico. She told me of her vibrant friends and family, festivals, wonderful food, etc. Her family had a beautiful home near the ocean. Her bedroom had its own balcony overlooking the pool. It was a virtual paradise. In the U.S, they lived completely isolated from their former life, in a very average house with no excess or luxury. I asked her why did she leave all of that. Her answer was horrifying. She told that she just wanted to walk down the street without the fear of being raped. Her beautiful house in PR was covered with bars and security systems. One night back home, someone had left a security door open&hellip;they were so relieved that no one was dead or raped the next morning. Imagine living like that? She told me that no luxury was worth that kind of risk. I discussed this situation with her mother as well, in my high school Spanish. She agreed. After a few drinks, the mother lamented, &#8220;There are so many rapes in my country. There is something wrong with latin and black men&hellip;they are &#8216;hot blooded&rsquo;&#8221;. That was her term, &#8220;hot blooded&#8221;. You must know that this family was always very decent and generous to me. They were not criminals or bad people in any manner. They were not self-hating either.  I did not say these things, they did. They saw this as the truth.</p>

<p>Missives like that make me wonder what the plutocrats who want to turn the United States into Brazil are using for brains.  Yes, it will make them literally more wealthy, but what good is all their wealth if it&rsquo;s surrounded by the third world?  What good are all their big estates and mansions if they are nothing more than prisons for the plutocrats who own them, because third world criminality is ubiquitous right outside the gates?  They say you don&rsquo;t know what you have until it&rsquo;s gone, but in the case of your classmate, they didn&rsquo;t know what they didn&rsquo;t have until they were able to attain it, and in this case, &#8220;it&#8221; was something that no amount of money could buy   &mdash;   The social stability of a first world white society.  It&rsquo;s sort of like that verse in Proverbs   &mdash;   A good reputation is to be chosen rather than great riches.  I suppose a civilized and domestically tranquil society could be construed as a good reputation.</p>
