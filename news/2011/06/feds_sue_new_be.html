<h1><a href="/articles/2011/06/24/news/wisconsin_news/wi2403.txt">Feds Sue New Berlin for Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beloit Daily News, June 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. government has filed a lawsuit alleging New Berlin city officials caved to pressure from their largely white community by deciding not to build low-income housing that could attract more black families.</p>
<p>The mayor and other city officials voted in May 2010 to allow the construction but reconsidered following an immediate backlash from the community, according to federal prosecutors. Their lawsuit was dated Wednesday and released Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New Berlin is about 15 miles southwest of Milwaukee. The city&rsquo;s website quotes 2000 census data that say about 96 percent of the city&rsquo;s 38,000 residents are white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The city Department of Community Development recommended that the application be approved. A few days later the city planning commission, of which the mayor is a member, voted 4-3 to approve the general application.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, city officials were inundated with emails and phone calls, the majority of which voiced opposition to the project, federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the opposition was based in part on fear that the prospective tenants would be African American or minority,&#8221; the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mayor also received threatening phone calls at home, his car tires were slashed, his car windows were shot through, and a sign reading &#8220;(N-word) lover&#8221; was placed in his yard, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>About two weeks later the mayor asked the planning commission to let him reconsider his vote, saying he was concerned about certain parking waivers included in the original approval.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>See people, screaming and acting like violent hooligans works.  Quiet protests and angry letters do not.  If you don&rsquo;t want blacks moving near you, simply act like they do when something they don&rsquo;t want is about occur.</p>
<p>Some might say it&rsquo;s sinking to their level.  I say it&rsquo;s preventing that from happening on a city/county/country wide scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the only thing that will change a crazed race liberal&rsquo;s mind.</p>

		<p>Same thing happened in Yonkers, NY about 20 years ago. They didn&rsquo;t want the low income projects built on the &#8220;good&#8221; side of the river, so they shut it down. I think a federal judge started fining Yonkers like $10,000 a day every day until construction started. It started.</p>

		<p>LOL &hellip; so the Federal government is suing New Berlin for resisting low income housing that <i>could</i> attract Black families?  So, in other words, the residents of New Berlin should have <i>foreseen</i> the new residents would be Black; and as a result are accountable for possible racism?  Yet, God forbid the residents of New Berlin <i>foresee</i> that the new residents are likely to to burden law enforcement, drain resources, and threaten the safety of current residents.  No, that assumption is never allowed.  One must remain perpetually ignorant about that sort of thing.  </p>

		<p>It think it would be most interesting if a township challenged the Feds on this question simply by pointing out that the crime rate in all such areas historically has always exploded upward with any significant influx of blacks.  There are simply no exceptions to this law of nature.</p>
<p>If the Feds would like to flood the new housing project with thousands of Federal agents, empowered to enforce all local ordinances, build a nearby prison to house all those arrested and convicted, and of course finance a large new courthouse complex to prosecute the newly arrived miscreants, I suppose I could go along with their proposed low income housing proposal.</p>

		<p>The article states:</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. government has filed a lawsuit alleging New Berlin city officials caved to pressure from their largely white community by deciding not to build low-income housing that could attract more black families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation:  Our leftist government is determined to destroy any vestigal semblance of historic, peculiarly American culture. If not done &#8220;voluntarily&#8221;, then the full force and pressure of the US government will come to bear:  &#8220;You WILL like strawberry ice cream!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the opposition was based in part on fear that the prospective tenants would be African American or minority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tranlsation:  The people of New Berlin would like to be safe and secure in their homes.  They would like their crime rate to remain below, not at or above the national average.  They would like their school test scores to remain higher. They see the TV news on the latest minority crime, and prefer to watch it in the comfort of their homes rather than being the subject of &#8220;film at 11&#8221;.   </p>
<p>&#8220;About two weeks later the mayor asked the planning commission to let him reconsider his vote&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: The mayor is scared for his life, plus the prospect of being out of a job come re-election time is undoubtedly exigent.  Of course, what is politically expedient is his ultimate objective.  </p>

<p>So white people aren&rsquo;t allowed to have an opinion and lobby their government based on those opinions?  The original article doesn&rsquo;t say on what grounds the DOJ are suing New Berlin.  Probably the real reason has to do with revenge because Scott Walker is the state&rsquo;s Governor.</p>

 Developers seeking to build affordable housing, under federal/state mandates in overwhelmingly white towns like New Berlin is a disgusting tactic. Unfortunately this tactic has become quite popular in the last ten years.<br>
 <br>
This developer and others like him, are using affordable housing guidelines as an end- around tactic to bypass and flout existing zoning laws. In the end the developer walks away with big-bucks and the white residents are left with new construction and occupants they never wanted. And just to add a little insult to injury, the developer will always be a white guy. You can bet on that.</p>
<p> Just the name &#8220;New Berlin&#8221; confirms it&rsquo;s historic past. No doubt settled in the mid- eighteenth century by German immigrants so well represented in that region along with ethnic Scandanavians and Polish. New Berlin doesn&rsquo;t need or &#8220;want&#8221; a racial injection into it&rsquo;s healthy veins!  Those people have every right and expectation to live in a the kind of community to their liking. After all, past generation of them made it that way and certainly not blacks or hispanics.</p>
<p>On one hand, slashing tires and e-mailing racial epithets isn&rsquo;t gonna shake out well in the end either. The key here &#8220;for now&#8221; is to keep any resistance strictly &#8220;defacto&#8221; and out of sight, by implementing the combined social, economic and political forces  to our advantage.</p>
<p>On the other hand I applaud some of them for not taking this lying down. As I&rsquo;ve written before if you want to see a real white segregationist don&rsquo;t look south, look north. Most whites up there just won&rsquo;t except living in close proximity to too many non- whites, especially blacks much beyond token numbers.No, not even your liberals. But don&rsquo;t point this out to them though,- they&rsquo;ll often go ballistic.</p>

		<p>Dear Fed totalitarians:  Please move the low income housing project to Chappaqua, New York, as close to the Clinton household as is feasible.  The Clintons love diversity and are eagerly awaiting the day when whites are a minority in this country.  Please don&rsquo;t make them wait too long for the experience.</p>

		<p>An earlier Amren comment captures the very real danger that awaits New Berlin if the U. S. government&rsquo;s legal assault on the town succeeds:</p>
<p>15  &mdash;  Mary wrote at 9:32 PM on December 7, 2010: </p>
<p>&hellip; Recently in NE Philadelphia, a large housing project was closed by the city and razed to the ground because the blacks totally trashed the place. Now all the Section-Eighters moved into my daughter&rsquo;s apartment complex and have begun tormenting the white residents who have been living there. My granddaughter is only 6 years old. She has been hit and threatened by black teens. They stole all my daughter&rsquo;s lawn decorations and my granddaughter&rsquo;s scooter. They bounce basketballs up against the outside wall day and night, just to torture them. Just plain mean. When any whites complain to a black parent (as usual, it&rsquo;s only Mom because nobody knows who the dad is), all they get is racial slurs and a flurry of filthy language. My family is moving back here on December 31 until they find a place free of urban blacks. The term &lsquo;blockbuster&rsquo; from the 60s has now taken on a new meaning&hellip; .&#8221;<br>

		<p>The US government is bound and determined to foist black poverty and all the negative aspects of it on whites no matter what. Did the officials of this town &#8220;cave&#8221; as the US goverment claims or where they just doing what their constituents wanted?

		<p>Why does every town need to be &#8220;multicultural&#8221;? It is VERY obvious the residents (IE: TAX PAYERS!) do not want section 8 housing in their community. The residents of this city want to keep their city as it is and not introduce an element of disruption (to put it mildly) to their community. Why do the leftist tyranny enforcers continue to force cities to commit social suicide continually, it is infuriating. So much for people controlling who they live amongst, not in this &#8220;post-racial&#8221; hell of 2011 America.</p>

		<p>once you get your teeth kicked in for walking down the street, for being white, things become much more personal, and the politicians empty blather about diversity and tolerance become meaningless and worse. There must be a response. White people have always been able to handle things. See if we still can. Getting rid of the 5th column will have to be a priority. </p>

		<p>I would say the opposition was probably a result of the many racially motivated attacks taking place across the country. You know, the ones the MSM has been censoring. Perhaps they didn&rsquo;t have confidence in the governments ability to protect them from the gangs of racist &#8220;youths&#8221; who would be living in that low in-come housing.</p>

		<p>It just goes to show that the right to free association is dead. We&rsquo;ve gone all the way from outlawing positive acts of discrimination to banning mere inaction, in this case the refusal to allow certain kinds of housing that attract the welfare and criminal classes and cause a community to go into terminal decline.</p>
<p>What makes this even more egregious is that now the federal government is stepping in and undermining the mores and values of the local community. This is exactly what happened in Lewiston, Maine, when the government imported loads of Somalis into an erstwhile calm, peaceful and homogeneous Euro-American town.</p>
<p>I hope the city can win this case. But with the federal government filing suit in its own courts, I pretty much doubt it. Another formerly decent community down the drain.</p>

<p>I see how it works: it&rsquo;s a democracy until whites stand up for their own interests, then suddenly it&rsquo;s &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all fairness, however, whites wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess if they had spoken out for their own interests all along. Because they failed to speak out for their rights as a group, their rights were taken away from them.</p>
<p><i> The mayor also received threatening phone calls at home, his car tires were slashed, his car windows were shot through, and a sign reading &ldquo;(N-word) lover&rdquo; was placed in his yard, the lawsuit said.</i> </p>

		<p>Many of the white people living in New Berlin probably went there while fleeing other towns that have already been overrun by blacks. They realize that if New Berlin also becomes heavily black, there are fewer places to go next, and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re fighting so hard against the housing project. This is a good sign that whites are finally putting their foot down and not tolerating the destruction of any more nice towns. There&rsquo;s also the fact that the blacks seem to be more dangerous these days, as there are more stories about roaming black mobs attacking people. New Berlin can&rsquo;t be blamed for wanting to keep this out. </p>

		<p>This reminds me of Somalians coming to America in 2000, to a state that was 95% White at the time: Maine. Special interests &churches; took up the effort to allow it to happen, never putting it to a vote because it would have been obvious to everyone that the community would not approve it. So who needs democracy when you can just impose a dictator-like rule of law and implement whatever you&rsquo;d like. And Ghaddafi is the enemy? We&rsquo;ve got our own right here people. </p>
<p>Well, one of three things will happen:<br>
 (a) Whites in New Berlin will leave in large groups like nomads to a new White community<br>
(b) Whites will arm themselves and be vigilante &amp; look out for one another.(I&rsquo;m not holding my breath on that)<br>
(c) The blacks/Mestizos will eradicate the standard of living and rob, rape, murder and set the community ablaze with reckless abandon and no one does a thing about it. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong. I really do. </p>

		<p>Once again: When whites don&rsquo;t want nonwhites, especially blacks around them and when we don&rsquo;t wish to have our money support them, it&rsquo;s racism.  When blacks want to only look out for blacks  &mdash;  and at the expense of whites  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s called diversity.  I&rsquo;m tired of blacks and liberals calling whites racist for not wanting to give them our money and possessions.  All whites should read Racism Schmacism by James Edwards.  If they did, this world would be a lot better off.</p>

		<p>The fedgov does this all over the country.  Yonkers, NY and Sunnyvale, TX are among the ones that make news.  Towns and counties usually cave to pressure from DC&rsquo;s goons.</p>
<p>Even in a monoracial society, this kind of heavy-handed bullying from government is just plain repugnant.  The track record of &#8220;low income housing&#8221; makes residents&rsquo; opposition absolutely understandable.  Approval of Section 8 buildings in their community would be downright foolish!</p>
<p>New Berlin needs ALL our SUPPORT!</p>

		<p>Eliminate HUD and all it&rsquo;s funding when 2013 rolls around, elect people to office that cut off the gravy train. That is the reason only hard-core conservatives should get elected to political office, to put localities under LOCAL control. Walker gave you a CC law and broke the back of the NEA and other union leeches in Wisconsin, in Nov 2012 finish the job by voting out Obama and his thugs. If you vote for a democrat for ANYTHING, you deserve what you get.</p>

		<p><b>Well, one of three things will happen:</b></p>
<p>Whites have been doing that for decades now and these blacks and other nonwhites follow us.  How&rsquo;s that been working out?  Pretty soon there will be nowhere to run.</p>
<p><b><br>
 (a) Whites in New Berlin will leave in large groups like nomads to a new White community</b></p>
<p>Again, where will they go and when will whites learn that they need to quit running away from problems and hold their ground and say, &#8220;No!  We don&rsquo;t want you.  Leave.  You&rsquo;re not welcome&#8221;?  Whites all over the world are being invaded with third-world immigration.  </p>
<p><b><br>
 (b) Whites will arm themselves and be vigilante &amp; look out for one another.(I&rsquo;m not holding my breath on that)</b></p>
<p>Being that guns are illegal in most of Europe, how are the white Berliners going to get armed?</p>
<p><b><br>
 (c) The blacks/Mestizos will eradicate the standard of living and rob, rape, murder and set the community ablaze with reckless abandon and no one does a thing about it. I hope I&rsquo;m wrong. I really do. </b></p>
<p>And of course, whites will leave, say &#8220;There was a lot of crime there&#8221; without connecting the dots, the same problem will follow them again, they will move again and repeat the same process.  When will whites wake up, take a stand and stop the invasion?<br>

		<p>Did you eve read the article, White is right? New Berlin is near Milwaukee. Last time I checked that is in Wisconsin. Last time I checked that is in America. Last time I checked we have a Constitutional right to bear arms in America. </p>
<p>Another thing about your comments is that there  are never places in the USA that stay the same. For example in Los Angeles there are former black areas taken over by Mestizos. Whites can do the same type of things if they go to where a traditionalist background is developing, and they are someewhere. </p>

<p>New Berlin is in Wisconsin, not far from Milwaukee, if you read the full article.  As for Berlin, Germany, there are more guns around than you imagine.  Owning a gun is not illegal, just subject to licensing, and it is a more thorough process.  When I lived in Europe, I remember a story about French citizens complaining about hunters firing their guns too close to their homes.  They may not have access to semi-autos the way we do, but they have access to firearms.</p>

		<p>How patronizing and condescending of the FED to suggest that the ONLY way blacks could afford to move into New Berlin is via the help of an affordable housing entitlement program. Newsflash FED, there are plenty of blacks who can afford to buy in New Berlin, but maybe, just maybe, they CHOOSE NOT TO. There is nothing wrong w/ a mostly white community, just like there is nothing wrong w/ a mostly black or hispanic, or asian community. People are free to choose where they want to live. The interference of the FED in those choices via forced entitlements is not the American way.</p>

		<p>As one writer pointed out, pressure tactics really work, where letters to the local politicians don&rsquo;t. Find the weak point and then hit it hard. What is the one point or person that will make a difference? Then apply pressure and the whole thing comes down. We should read Saul Alinskey&rsquo;s &#8220;Rules for Radicals&#8221; and use the same tactics against them. </p>
