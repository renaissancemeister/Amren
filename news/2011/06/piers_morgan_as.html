		<p>Speaking of Ann Coulter, I&rsquo;m actually disappointed in her new book, if the excerpts aren&rsquo;t taken out of context.  My esteem of her went way up because of her last book, when she defended the Council of Conservative Citizens by name.  But now in this, her latest book, while she did tell some controversial truths, especially about MLK, she also insinuated that Thurgood Marshall was an angel (i.e. using &#8220;legal&#8221; methods as opposed to MLK&rsquo;s Rousseauean street theater tactics), bashed Bull Connor for having &#8220;turned the hoses on kids&#8221; (hint:  The MLK cabal deliberately used teenagers for their street theater because they had nothing to lose   &mdash;   Most of the adults in the civil rights movement did have jobs, even though this was &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be the seggy south when &#8220;whitey&#8221; didn&rsquo;t give black people any jobs).  I&rsquo;ll eventually be able to read the book, and I&rsquo;m guessing it will be worthwhile for the good parts, but I&rsquo;ll be reading it with eyes wide open.</p>

		<p>Watch again and check out approx, 3:16 of the video. Ann Coulter mistakenly says Jared &#8220;Taylor&#8221; instead of &#8220;Loughner&#8221;. Oops! Slow down Ann. Well at least you know she reads AR.</p>

		<p>Did I detect a freudian slip here? It sounded like Coulter said &#8220;Jared <i>Taylor</i> shot up the congresswoman rather than Jared <i>Loughner</i> shot up the congresswoman. </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s either more familiar with Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s work than she might let on or Taylor&rsquo;s name has been so confused in the media with Loughner&rsquo;s that she got the two of them mixed up.</p>

		<p>This video is very instructive. Not only does Coulter conflate Taylor with Loughner, but even if she was familiar with Taylor, she, like most of the Neocons and mainstream conservatives, would label him a &#8220;racist.&#8221; You see, whether you&rsquo;re talking about Bush, Palin, Coulter, McCain, or any of the talking heads on Fox News, these are not friends of ours. They lack the kinds of conviction it takes for a genuine white grassroots movement to gain traction.</p>
<p>Taylor could easily have the number #1 hardcover bestseller in America right now, were he to avoid the pesky realities of race and pen something asinine like &#8220;Why Liberals Are Pea-Brains.&#8221; He could be in Brit Hume&rsquo;s chair reading the nightly report on Fox. Money is important to any movement, but it must not come at the expense of your convictions. I&rsquo;m not holding my breath waiting for the tea-party&rsquo;s implicit whiteness to flower into genuine racial solidarity or consciousness any time soon. If Sarah Palin or Herman Caine are the candidate(s) in 2012, I will wash my hands of the election.</p>

The link to Conservatives and the Arizona shooting has been discredited and yet it lives on in the talking points of liberals.</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan is a poor performer. His calm-act is coached and staged. &#8216;Stay calm. Ask shock questions. Make her look like an extremist&rsquo;. </p>
<p>These questions were likely complied by staff and consultants to provoke strong reactions; fluster her by implying she and those of her ilk are Nazis.</p>
<p>No wonder Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s ratings are as poor as they are. <br/>

		<p>Not to split hairs, but many things that liberals support (abortion, euthanasia, gun control, environmentalism, make-work government jobs, and so on) were also things that Hitler and Mussolini supported. So, who&rsquo;s on the side of Hitler and Mussolini?</p>

		<p> Did she actually say &#8220;Jared Taylor&#8221; when she named the alleged Arizona mass murderer?! I&rsquo;m sure it was a faux pas, because (a) Ann Coulter wouldn&rsquo;t have said the wrong name intentionally and (b) she did a superb job of defending her point of view and her book against the leftist Mr. Morgan.</p>
<p> I can see, though, how she might have made the mistake, due to the vile and inflammatory (and inaccurate) link Fox News initially made between Loughner and American Renaissance. It&rsquo;s easy to make a misstatement when someone who is interviewing you keeps interrupting and won&rsquo;t let you finish a sentence. </p>

<p>She is a moron. I never liked that woman. She always dressed funny, talked funny, her hair etc. is not flattering. Somethinf is off kilter about her. I am not the least bit surprised that she likes those blacks you mentioned. Most of the neocon talking heads all do. They will never put blacks in a bad light, but they have no problem putting Whites in a bad light. </p>
<p>Maybe Ann could expound a little on blacks and their &#8220;unique&#8221; history in America?  They have been trouble ever since they set foot on our soil. Now that is UNIQUE!</p>

<p>Of course it&rsquo;s only speculation on my part, but I believe it&rsquo;s the former.  I&rsquo;ve been politically active long enough to know many conservative Republicans are actually closet White Nationalists.  I&rsquo;m convinced Ann Coulter is one of them; in fact, I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p>
<p>http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Until that point, immigration law basically took a laissez-faire approach, with country quotas attempting to replicate the traditional immigration patterns. Most immigrants to America had historically come from Great Britain, Germany and Scandinavian countries. Consequently, immigration quotas roughly reflected that balance, with smaller numbers of immigrants admitted from other countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1960, whites were 90 percent of the country. The Census Bureau recently estimated that whites already account for less than two-thirds of the population and will be a minority by 2050. Other estimates put that day much sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One may assume the new majority will not be such compassionate overlords as the white majority has been. If this sort of drastic change were legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide. Yet whites are called racists merely for mentioning the fact that current immigration law is intentionally designed to reduce their percentage in the population.&#8221;</p>
<p><br/>
Tim in Indiana, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if Ann Coulter regularly peruses this website.  Unlike Hirsch and Bernie, though, who I feel are way too rough on her (she is after all, a woman), I&rsquo;m willing to give her a pass.  Why?  Two reasons:</p>
<p>1) If she openly espoused White Nationalist tenets, how successful would she be?  Also, what would HAPPEN to her?  Again, she is a woman.  To some that may sound &#8216;sexist&rsquo;, but it is a valid point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUyz_G1vIhU&amp;feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUyz_G1vIhU&feature;=related</a></p>
<p>2) More importantly, other than Jared Taylor, Frank Borzellieri, and a handful of others, where are all the MEN among White Nationalists?  European-Americans are literally losing the country their forefathers fought for even as we speak, yet it&rsquo;s staggering to see the level of cowardice among our kind, even among my own friends and family!  I&rsquo;m a pariah among many of my own relatives because of my outspoken views on race.  Don&rsquo;t kid yourself: our enemies know about White cowardice, too.</p>
<p>Until someone can give me credible answers to those questions (ESPECIALLY in #2) I don&rsquo;t think anyone can criticize women like Ann Coulter too sharply.</p>

		<p>Why is this country now invested with idiotic limey&rsquo;s everywhere you turn? If these clowns thought PC nazism was so great they&rsquo;d still be slinking around in that country instead hiding out here now. If Ann had the sack I thought she did, she should have said, &#8220;who the hell are you and why do I have to explain myself to you in my own country&#8221;?</p>

		<p>A number of years ago now, in one of the first Fox News panel discussions in which I saw Ann Coulter, she impressed me by not being intimidated when a black panelist tried to derail her for having used some supposedly insulting reference such as &#8220;you people&#8221; (it was some such benignly &#8220;provocative&#8221; term/phrase as that).  She lashed right back in self-defense, turning on her &#8220;assailant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew then she had more spunk than most white males in the media.</p>
<p>Bernie, post #6: I saw that recent interview with Stossel where she said she didn&rsquo;t make fun of blacks because of their &#8220;unique history.&#8221;  Sounded disappointing, to be sure.  But, I don&rsquo;t think she meant they were beyond criticism.  And if her white-skinned back were to the wall, I&rsquo;ll bet she&rsquo;d unleash the fury of a cornered guard dog.  Underneath it all, I think she&rsquo;s an ally; and better a friend than not.</p>
<p>These days, notice how women are more at liberty to speak their minds than men?  According to the governmedia, testosterone = bad.  Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong guys, I&rsquo;m no feminist-chauvinist.  But Bachman/Palin: you go, girls!  </p>

		<p>Coulter is just another typical Conservative who, when it comes to issues of race and the like, is only marginally less mendacious that her liberal peers, whom she so despises. I used to think that she technically &#8220;got it&#8221; with regard to race, but as with say, a Pat Buchanan, just toed the line on race for &#8220;professional&#8221;(that is to say - in order to sell books and get on talk-shows)reasons. But over the years, it seems pretty obvious that she really doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;get it&#8221; at all - or at least not most of it! </p>

<p>Are you all that surpsired. Ann Coulter, Glenn Beck, David Horowitz, Sean Hanity and all other neo-cons have never been the friends of racially concious Whites or those of us who are genuinely concerened with the survival of our race.</p>

		<p>   On the subject of Bull Connor, this man was from a generation that did not tolerate total anarchy in the street . Whether I agree with his actions or disagree with them, is a moot point . He was in charge, it was his job to restore law and order . That&rsquo;s what he did .</p>
<p>   A well known Southern writer from that same region and generation, whom the liberals love to claim as their own to this day, said&hellip;&#8221; the black man&rsquo;s time has come that&rsquo;s undeniable, but if he thinks he can get out in the street and break the law, I&rsquo;ll be shooting a few myself .&#8221; That&rsquo;s not an exact quote, but it is on the money . He used a more archaic ethnic term, plus I&rsquo;d have to dig up my early 60&rsquo;s news magazine to nail it down more accurately .</p>
<p>   <br/>
  When WW1 vets camped out on the capital grounds to demand a benefit they had not yet received, their camp was bull dozed by Douglas McArthur and George Patton . One veteran was killed by a local cop .</p>
<p>  During the Matewan mine revolt about a dozen miners were killed by company security . During the Ludlow mine revolt in Colorado, about 29 miners or family members were killed by the Colorado National Guard . It&rsquo;s been said that &#8221; we are the sum of all of our experiences .&#8221; Well this was the world that Bull Connor was from . Little tolerance for anarchy . And I might add that it was the more common logic of that era both north and south of the Mason-Dixon line . Of course that was all before the successful anti-establishment, counter revolution of the sixties that turned America upside down . Or as Robert Bork so aptly put it, &#8220;The vertical invasion of the barbarians .&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen &#8220;Chairman&#8221; Ann on Fox news many times; even on left-wing CNN.  She never seems comfortable on TV.  Her thing is the acerbic pen.  I&rsquo;ve never read her books but I do read weekly &amp; usually enjoy her columns (from her website).  I believe she picks her spots so she can stay a (fringe) part of the MSM.  If she went &#8220;all the way&#8221; she&rsquo;d be banned in no time.</p>
<p>I do find it disturbing that she&rsquo;s a closet hippie &#8220;Grateful Dead&#8221; deadhead.  Hippies do NOT rule in my world.  If she were a Bill Evans fan I&rsquo;d like her more.</p>

		<p>I was also disappointed to see her praise Marshall on Hannity&rsquo;s show.  But she did let slip a few hate facts about MLK and his tactics.  And she has referred to the mortgage meltdown as the minority mortgage meltdown.  Neocon Hannity never lets an opportunity to trumpet his admiration for MLK, etc. pass him by.  I wish a caller to his show would ask him if he would still support school vouchers and school choice if 200 voucher-wielding students showed up at his kids&rsquo; schools on Monday.  Neocons like him, Beck, Coulter, Horowitz can separate themselves from policies they support for the rest of us.  I think Limbaugh might one day come very close to the truth.  What do you think of Pat Buchanan?  He&rsquo;s been talking about immigration (legal too) for decades.  And also how Obamacare is a transfer of wealth from whites to nonwhites.    </p>

		<p>#19 Anonymous: Your explanation of Bull Conner&rsquo;s tactics versus lawless mayhem was both accurate and insightful.  Thank you.</p>
<p>#17 Anonymous: Where was Bull Conner 10 yrs. ago when Cincinnati streets were besieged by rioting, looting, violent black mobs demanding better police-community relations?  His fire hoses might have improved the &#8220;community&rsquo;s&#8221; understanding of peaceable assembly.  </p>
<p>#18 Disgusted: I&rsquo;ve never felt betrayed by David Horowitz.  He may not necessarily espouse white nationalism, but he sure doesn&rsquo;t go easy on the black nationalists.  Ever heard him describe his experiences with the Panthers?  He is NOT sympathetic to the notion of &#8220;Black Power.&#8221;      </p>

		<p>Ann Coulter is the Fox News neocon war party. This world view is 100 percent incompatible with the preservation of a Native Born White American Majority. Fox News-fake conservatism and  war mongering goes hand in hand with race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. Native Born White American Patriotism is fundamentally two things:massive opposition to race-replacement and 2)massive opposition to Fox News-neocon war crimes.</p>
<p>Ann Coulter&rsquo;s slip about Jared Taylor makes it very clear that she has completely internalized the Neocon policies of wars of agression and race-replacement. She is not a conservative..she is obviously an America hating and America destroying evil creature-and that&rsquo;s very evil. If anyone here thinks that an unmarried amost 50 year old  childless White Woman with no children, who associates with a poltical movement-NeoCons-that is fanatically enthusiastic about race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;is conservative..well, you are just either massively brain damaged or senile.</p>

		<p>Ann Coulter is another neocon.  Spouting the same stuff that caused the GOP to fail in 2012 and pandering to blacks and other nonwhite groups that hate conservatives, hate whites and who will never vote for small government.  Why would they?  All of their &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; and entitlement programs are the result of bigger and intrusive government.</p>

		<p>Hitler paid women to stay home and have kids and created not one but two separate, national healthcare, systems to support it.</p>
<p>Hitler created a &#8216;stimulus&rsquo; program that succeeded in employing only about 60% of the German workforce while creating massive shortages in the food and fuel and raw materials supplies as he tried to simultaneously buy 26 vital commodities not available in Germany proper using dwindling gold stocks which guaranteed his currency.</p>
<p>Hitler enacted sterilization and euthanasia of mentally disturbed (with the permission and encouragement of the medical establishment) &#8216;medical boards&rsquo; that effected perhaps 60,000 people.</p>
<p>Democrats have butchered anything up to 35 million white abortion victims while setting up free clinics in Black Neighborhoods that could more realistically be called genocidal.</p>
<p>Hitler indulged in double column book keeping by which the top two banks in Germany &#8216;quantitatively eased&rsquo; the Reichsmark by writing each other loans to the point where the German gold reserves were down to nothing and their entire currency system worthless, making WWII more or less assured by the inability to gain taxable population faster than debt (Danzig Corridor).</p>
<p>Hitler did all this damage while hiding behind a replacement governing system which essentially bypassed all local state controls in Germany with a shadow government that looked a LOT like &#8216;Homeland Security&rsquo; and called out anyone critical of his regime as a security threat.</p>
<p>Given the way the Obama Administration has continued to &#8216;stay the course&rsquo; in SWA as a massive military rent-seeking effort while trying to stand up a social welfare state for &#8216;his people&rsquo;, I would say that he and Hitler were liberal birds of a feather.</p>
<p>There now, see how snide and insulting this partisan politic label-gaming can be?  NOT ONCE did we hear Republican Coulter&rsquo;s opinion on the _policies_ of Palin.  Nor her analysis of Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;progress towards change&rsquo; as the Democratic alternative.</p>
<p>It was a case of instantly degrading the conversation to one of identity group politics.</p>
<p>That too is &#8216;National Socialist, Socialist Democrat or Communist&rsquo; (with us or against us) artifact of the smear campaigns ongoing in 1920s-30s Germany.</p>
<p>Given history is supposed to teach us better, why are our political and MSM establishments instead reenacting a war for populations as a means to buy into political dogma for it&rsquo;s own sake?</p>

		<p>There is one obvious reason why Piers Morgan&rsquo;s comparison is wrong.  The leader of the brownshirts and the leader of the blackshirts was obvious.  The Tea Party Movement has no obvious singular leader, nor any one person that even experts who might want to do dissertations on the TPM can can discern as a leader.</p>
<p>As for Miss Coulter, other than the substance of her ideology, I can understand why a lot of people don&rsquo;t like her, because it&rsquo;s the same reason why I know a lot of people aren&rsquo;t too fond of me.  As someone perpetually working toward a Ph.D. in snarkology and sarcasm, (one that I&rsquo;ll never attain), I can attest that sarcasm is an art that most people either don&rsquo;t understand, don&rsquo;t grok, or it is repugnant to them from a personality standpoint.  In spite of her being too close to the Republican and conservative lamestream, (while temptingly dipping her toe in the AmRen waters every once in awhile), I read her columns and books as a matter of appointment, just for the snark alone.  So good at it is she that I&rsquo;d very likely still be an appointment reader of hers even if she were left wing.  The best analogue to her on the left used to be Keith Olbermann, but he ditched his clever snark to become an unhinged leftist long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do find it disturbing that she&rsquo;s a closet hippie &ldquo;Grateful Dead&rdquo; deadhead. Hippies do NOT rule in my world. If she were a Bill Evans fan I&rsquo;d like her more.&#8221;</p>
<p>If she said that she&rsquo;s a fool.  Hippies were based on the idea that you would disengage yourself from the modern world and form communes that would and could live of the discards of a modern world that they didn&rsquo;t participate in.  That is the actual definition of the movement - abbreviated.  Hippies who became political were not really hippies, but inspired by &#8220;Yippies,&#8221;<br/>
which was the Chicago based leftist set of organizations that for example gave rise to The Weathermen.  Anyway, there has never been a right-wing conservative Deadhead, hippie.  It&rsquo;s like calling yourself and atheist who believes in God.</p>
<p>Having served on the medical staff at many GD shows many years ago, and familiar with the lifestyle of a &#8220;Deadhead&#8221; she is definitely NOT one.  She would have to smoke pot, and do LSD regularly - and it would show.  All should realize however, that much of the GD music is either based in American folk music, country music, old time, whatever you like to call it, and that they were involved with some famous blue grass bands.  Jerry Garcia played a very good banjo and loved old time music.  They are responsible largely for the rise in bluegrass festivals popularity.  They were playing that stuff to kids way back in the &rsquo;60s, and forming a musical bridge to old time music.  I think the term &#8220;Americana&#8221; came up to describe what they were doing first.  At best, Ann Coulter has found the music appealing, but has no idea what a Deadhead is.</p>

		<p>To #25 Cincinnati Kid&hellip;Horowitz is a typical neocon.  Supports high levels of third-world immigration.  Loves war and seems willing to sacrifice large numbers of our soldiers.  And if you don&rsquo;t support Middle East wars he gets VERY upset.   </p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that Horowitz supports immigration or that he&rsquo;s a war hawk.  As to the Middle East; well yes, I know that he&rsquo;s Jewish.  No wonder he&rsquo;s got a dog in that fight.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about our interests over there unless it&rsquo;s ALL about oil (I DO drive a car and use a lawnmower).  But since Obama has come out in support of the Palestinians, I find myself more and more sympathetic with Israel.</p>

<p>Re Ann Coulter and the Grateful Dead: I understand some posters&rsquo; concern about the Dead and the hippie philosphy they, more than any other rock group, embodied. The hippies have done much damage to our Western societies, no question. But there&rsquo;s a difference between appreciating some GD music (as I do) and being a Deadhead. The Deadheads were the fanatics, the lifestylers: the ones who devoted their lives to following the band around and partying in stadium parking lots. </p>
<p>But most fans are nowhere near that extreme. I once attended a Dead show and, although I enjoyed it, not once during the evening did I feel the urge to drop out of society or make a cardboard WILL WORK FOR JERRY TICKETS sign. I expect Ann Coulter&rsquo;s relationship to the band is much the same. I don&rsquo;t imagine she&rsquo;s ever needed to be admitted to the Freakout Tent. </p>
<p>The GD were, at least for a few years in the early &rsquo;70s, an extremely decent bluegrass/country-rock outfit. Their influence is not deadly as long as your intake is not excessive. Just stay within recommended dosage levels and don&rsquo;t overdo it. </p>

<p><a href="http://goo.gl/AdzZm" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/AdzZm</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eventually be able to read the whole thing and see if it&rsquo;s any better or worse than what it seems just from those excerpts.</p>
