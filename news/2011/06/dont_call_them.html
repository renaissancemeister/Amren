			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linsday Spangler, Care 2, June 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The &#8220;Millennial Generation&#8221; (born post-1980, ages 18-30) is the largest, most racially and ethnically diverse generation of individuals the United States has ever known. Unsurprisingly, public opinion surveys provide evidence that young people are more open-minded than their parents&rsquo; or grandparents&rsquo; generations about inter-racial friendships and relationships.</p>
<p>However, too many journalists, political commentators and even researchers read too much into this inter-racial open-mindedness and label young people today as &#8220;post-racial,&#8221; either explicitly or implicitly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to better understand the racial attitudes of millennials, and the study&rsquo;s results challenge the labeling of young people as post-racial. The Applied Research Center (ARC) conducted 16 focus group discussions in Los Angeles on the intersections of race and racism with key systems of society: criminal justice, housing, public schools, employment, healthcare and immigration. The participants were 18-25 years old, and each discussion session was divided into four groups: African Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, Latinos and whites.</p>
<p>The evidence from these focus group discussions strongly suggests that most young people today believe that race still matters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Like most Americans, the majority of young people have difficulty defining present-day racism when initially asked and typically fall back upon generic terms of <em>interpersonal racism</em></strong>. After an initial stumped silence or stumbling for words that greets a simple question of how to define present-day racism, the most common responses, both oral and written, are generic terms like &#8220;discrimination based upon race or color,&#8221; &#8220;stereotypes,&#8221; etc. Most white young people think about racism as something intentional and typically as something that occurs between individuals. On the other hand, while many young people of color similarly fall back on generic definitions of <em>interpersonal</em> racism when initially asked, most have little problem labeling an entire system as racist, given their personal and community experiences and the racial patterns of resources they see across systems. Moreover, young people with social or racial justice organizing experience and those who have taken courses in race and ethnicity tend to describe racism in <em>institutional</em> or systemic terms.</p>

<p>Yes, it is rather difficult to define something which we are told on a daily basis is ever-present no matter how much evidence to the contrary there is to prove that wrong.  Even the true believers of racism have difficulty pointing it out.  Shocking, really.</p>

		<p>I read this report and while this genartaiton may not be a post -racial as we have been led to believe, the fact is that they are still much more accepting of homosexuality, interracial marriage, casual drug use etc&hellip; than those of other generations. </p>
<p>This still does not bode well for our future.</p>

		<p>Listening to this video, it seems to me that the young people are arguing that racism is institutional. They are critical of American society. They are not hostile toward one another. If anything, it seems to be a &#8220;blame America&#8221; mentality.  </p>

		<p> Notice how in the original article, every group has its own, capitalized origin-title: African-American, Asian-American/Pacific Islander, Hispanic. Then there&rsquo;s us; we&rsquo;re just &#8220;whites.&#8221; No upper-case &#8220;W;&#8221; no original home designation. We&rsquo;re just &#8220;white;&#8221; like a picket fence, or a glass of milk, I presume.</p>
<p> Is there still a problem with &#8220;racism&#8221; in the U.S.? Of course there is   &mdash;   a lot of it is summed up in the disrespectful way we&rsquo;re referred to, as in the above paragraph. Or the way we&rsquo;re considered &#8220;fair game&#8221; on public transportation, in public schools, on the street (if we&rsquo;re isolated and don&rsquo;t appear to be &#8220;packing heat,&#8221; that is). Or the way there is always &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; for blacks who can&rsquo;t make it on their own in jobs or college   &mdash;   but none for us in professional sports, where many coaches won&rsquo;t even consider a White prospect any more.</p>
<p> It was also interesting that with all the malarkey the two blacks spouted in the video about &#8220;racism in our society,&#8221; they never explained just what it was, or specified how it is &#8220;holding back&#8221; minorities   &mdash;   mostly blacks. No, we&rsquo;re just supposed to nod our heads knowingly, and agree with them. What a bunch of sheep we&rsquo;ve become! </p>

		<p>Yes, race still matters. </p>
<p>And so does intelligence, culture, gender, manners, crime, wealth, height, beauty, talent, hard work, academic achievment, attitude, personal responsibility, conscience. etc. etc.</p>
<p>And these things always will matter. Not everything that happens to a person is based on race, racism, or perceived racism. There is a much broader world out there and it amazes me how our indoctrinated youth cannot think on their own. They simply repeat the liberal propaganda chants. And while they pretend to be educated, they certainly are not enlightened.</p>

<i>&#8220;The evidence from these focus group discussions strongly suggests that most young people today believe that race still matters.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The reason &#8220;racism&#8221;, or more accurately, racial awareness, doesn&rsquo;t go away is because race is real. You can&rsquo;t ignore something that is real. Ignoring or denying race is lying to yourself and others.</p>
<p>As long as races behave as and are seen as their stereotypes, awareness of racial differences will persist. A leopard can&rsquo;t change his spots and even if you call it something else or deny its existence, it&rsquo;s still a leopard.</p>
<p>I worked with college age kids. They are far from &#8216;racists&rsquo; in term of uninformed, ignorant beliefs. They are however, very much aware that blacks do behave like black stereotypes. When I questioned them about this, they told me, &#8216;it&rsquo;s not racist if it&rsquo;s true&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I would bet that the most racially naive generation was the Boomers, to which I belong.  We matured being told by the media and by intellectuals that blacks are just as intellectually capable as whites and that non-white failures are largely the result of bigotry.  Africa never progressed, we were informed, because it&rsquo;s off the main trade routes and had little access to cross-culturalization.  Once blacks were given the same opportunities as whites, they would succeed at the same pace.<br>
Now, a half century later, we see little change in rates of black success.  Criminality is still a huge problem for blacks, and now, with more access to whites, lawless blacks are a much greater danger.  And, with young people&rsquo;s constant use of the internet, most of them have become completely aware of the situation.  Also, since many of them are forced into association with blacks, they see the truth for themselves first hand.  </p>

		<p>This was the first generation that was truly indoctrinated with political correctness from a young age. I&rsquo;ve noticed a sort of cognitive dissonance with a lot of people from this generation; on the one hand, they know better than anyone what they&rsquo;re &#8220;supposed&#8221; to say. On the other hand, a lot of them are surprisingly realistic about race. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the internet haunts of people this age are notorious for their racism. </p>

		<p>I live in the UK, and even though most teenagers that I know will listen to rap, &#8220;R&B;&#8221;, dubstep and other forms of black music, and maybe even affect some &#8220;urban&#8221; mannerisms and speech patterns, they draw the line at associating with blacks outside of school or college, and they will even snicker at black stereotypes, make &#8220;racist&#8221; jokes and comments, and even say things such as &#8220;Some individual blacks are OK, but on the whole, no, I don&rsquo;t like them, and don&rsquo;t want to associate with them&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s still hope, I think.  But mention the BNP, and its as if you&rsquo;re showing a garlic smothered crucifix to a vampire. It ain&rsquo;t gonna be easy.   </p>

		<p>This video is an example of how poor the skills are of even intelligent-seeming inner city &#8216;youffs.&rsquo;  The narrator was reasonably well-spoken, yet his angle and conclusions were illogical and just plain misleading.</p>
<p>#1  If you notice the pie chart where he shows the racial makeup of his focus groups, whites were a mere 17%.  These whites were probably all ultra-liberal and for affirmative action, etc.  Since there are so FEW whites in that area, how can the evil &#8216;whites&rsquo; be racist or how can they be holding every non-white down?  That&rsquo;s like saying, &#8220;Well, there used to be a bunch of big dogs biting people around here, but even though there&rsquo;s hardly any left, there&rsquo;s still a &#8216;systemic&rsquo; problem of dog bites, even if they are largely non-existent now.&#8221;</p>
<p>#2 The one white girl interviewed on tape says that she &#8220;read&#8221; (past tense) about how black job applicants were discriminated against in the past.  This is the fallacy of taking past actions and making them concurrent with the present.  It happened fifty years ago, so it must still be happening now, even though in her city, blacks are OVER represented in all levels of local government (in proportion to their percentage of the pop.).</p>
<p>#3  No specific actions of &#8216;whites&rsquo; are mentioned as being discriminatory.  It is all vague and &#8216;systemic,&rsquo; but undefined to the point of being on par with the boogie man.</p>
<p>#4  The cross-eyed asian woman and the illiterate latinos were presented as aggrieved minorities, but neither one seemed particulary oppressed.  (The asian woman was dressed nicely and looked highly educated and well fed.  The latinos were in their own house chillin&rsquo;.)  Probably the only whites they ever see are in the classroom or in police uniforms.  </p>
<p>The whole California state is one big diversity program - and anyone is complaining there?  Oh, I get it now.  Whitey is leaving or fading away and the society he built is crumbling without him to be around to support it.  The majority-minorities who cannot work together in the vaunted &#8216;rainbow coalition&rsquo; are asking, &#8220;What happened to the goodies?&#8221;  And even though whitey is hardly 30-40% of the population, and mostly lives in northern California, if local welfare immigrants are dragging the state down - it must be whitey&rsquo;s fault, even if he ain&rsquo;t around!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so..we sure did not think like that in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s, believe me.</p>
<p> As for these middle aged becoming less liberal, I don&rsquo;t think so. They are all over our government, our colleges, our schools, our media and you name it. All of them middle aged and older, I would have to say.</p>
<p>Since the baby boomers, yes. . Now it has only gotten worse with each passing generation and the powers that be make certain of that. </p>

		<p>I think quoting one of my best friends when I questioned him about his dubious association with a black deadbeat is the best possible reply I could come up with for this,</p>
<p>&#8220;We might hang out, and hell, we might even be friends - but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t realize that the world would be a better place if every black and brown person was gone tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might see groups of young white people with the occasional token tagging along, that shouldn&rsquo;t be taken as an indicator that said group of white people is ignorant of typical black/brown behavior.</p>

		<p>Even though they said they interviewed four racial groups (while saying &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221;) the intent was to bash whites and get more guilt out of us.  Guilt=money+power.  Race matters, and it drives anti-white bigots and Marxists nuts.  You can tell lots of kids that a lion is friendly and nice, but millions of years of evolution will tell them otherwise.</p>

		<p>Two shockers: 1) That young whites still dare to see the obvious (that race exists) and 2) that the election of Obama did NOT usher in the glorious &#8220;post-racial&#8221; era that the libs were predicting! </p>
<p>Now notice how the video implies that the predictions of the post-racial era is apparently MORE proof of racism! But who was it who as predicting the post-racial era with the election of Obama? It was the LIBERALS, of course! </p>
<p>Obviously, the whole video and report is simply intended to get us to redefine our goals&hellip;once again. The previous predictions didn&rsquo;t materialize, so obviously we need yet more &#8220;uplift&#8221; and &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; programs! Ad nauseam, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Yes, and notice in the video how the female couldn&rsquo;t even get herself to utter the foul and contemptible word &#8220;White,&#8221; instead preferring the word Caucasian (well I guess that&rsquo;s capitalized, but only in print). It&rsquo;s almost as if the word &#8220;White&#8221; has become a dirty word when spoken (all that association with &#8220;white supremacists,&#8221; I guess).</p>

		<p>I see a sort of racial ambivalence common in many of this generation. They talk of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; and the like because, as others have already stated, they don&rsquo;t actually see any real &#8220;racism&#8221; at all - yet they are reminded of it every moment of the day via pop-culture, media, government, etc. So they feel they must have an opinion about it(to be &#8220;right-thinking&#8221; types and all that), yet in reality, they truthfully don&rsquo;t care much about it one way or the other - hence the ambivalence mentioned above. </p>
<p>On the plus side though, I honestly don&rsquo;t see a lot of that &#8220;anit-racist&#8221;(anti-White) attitude either. While it troubles me how they view non-Whites as equals and the like, it is notable that most also do NOT view non-Whites as victims of oppression or bigotry either - their life experiences just don&rsquo;t support those old mythologies. I also have encountered any number of this generation who are remarkably racially aware, all things considered.(thank you internet!)   </p>
<p>All said and done, they aren&rsquo;t so much &#8220;post-racial&#8221; as the usual suspects might have hoped, but, racial agnostics of a sort. I&rsquo;m not sure just where that will end up. </p>

		<p>Matched for IQ and mental ability, blacks are MORE successful than whites in America. </p>
<p>The reason is obvious: systematic discrimination IN FAVOR of blacks. </p>
<p>Given the way pro-black quotas function in the US, a black with an IQ of around 110 (nothing special for a white person, but quite exceptional for a black) is invariably successful - the system of racial spoils carries him up beyond his level of competence (example: Obama).</p>
<p>Conversely, liberals will simply ignore a white with an IQ around 80:<br>
he is just a dummy, utterly beneath their consideration, while a black with the same IQ is a &#8220;victim of the system&#8221; and deserving of all sorts of special attention. </p>
<p>It is somehow a complete mystery to them that he does not have a well-paying job.</p>
<p>Everyone - including and especially blacks - knows that blacks on average are less successful than whites because they&rsquo;re less intelligent on average.</p>
<p>It is rational for blacks to make wild accusations against white people and to make while demands for &#8220;compensation&#8221; for past wrongs, etc.</p>
<p>It is rational because it is the only plausible scenario according to which trillions of dollars will be transferred from whites to blacks on a regular basis.<br>
(Even the massive amount of crime committed by blacks against whites in America could never transfer this much wealth to them.)</p>
<p>Whites who go along with this hustle are the actual source of the problem.</p>
<p>The notion that the different human races have the same mental capacities is essentially the most massive scientific fraud in modern history. </p>
<p>The blacks themselves would probably never have come up with such a bizarre notion by themselves.</p>
<p>This is the doing of crazy white folks.</p>

		<p>Except for government agencies, the cream will generally rise to the top. </p>
<p>There were several people who complained about how bad the facilities (i.e. schools) were for Blacks vs Whites. One even mentioned the gym at Beverly Hills High School. How many White kids in Kentucky and West Virginia have received reasonably decent educations in buildings built during the 1930&rsquo;s that have outlived their useful lives. When the Whites were run out of Detroit in 1967, the city still had a fantastic infrastructure. Where does the problem lie? How many are going to complain about the Billion plus dollars drained from Missouri taxpayers to rebuild the KC MO school system. They had gold plated everything and it still was/is a failure. At least there is not the political will to recreate this mess. </p>
<p>Let all of these disadvantaged people go take the &#8220;Salina, Kansas 1895 test&#8221;. Most college graduates today couldn&rsquo;t pass it today. If you lived back then there was NO indoor plumbing, no motorized transportation (except trains), you walked or rode a horse to school and probably spent a few hours in the morning on farm chores. Why could our ancestors who had a fraction of the wealth we now own make such great strides while our kids are enthralled by &#8220;Lady Gaga&#8221;? Most people would go running out of the examination hall in sheer terror if this test were placed in front of them. </p>
<p>For any teachers out there, I don&rsquo;t know if you could legally do this, but what if you were able to find copies of the tests given for your equivalent course in the 1950&rsquo;s. I remember seeing one for 8th graders in 1954 where they had to name all 9 supreme court justices, every senator and congressman from that state and a number of other civics related questions. There was no internet in 1954 (Al Gore was only 6 and had not gotten around to inventing it). When the parents and the administration starts complaining, could you say &#8220;Were your counterparts in 1954 smarter than you?&#8221; Granted, this would probably get you blacklisted from every decent school district in the US.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The Beverly Hills High School &#8220;Swim Gym&#8221; was designed by Stiles O. Clements and built in 1939 as a New Deal project. It features a basketball court that opens to reveal a 25-yard (23 m)-long swimming pool underneath, as mentioned previously. It is featured in &#8220;It&rsquo;s A Wonderful Life&#8221; as the location of the <br>
dance. Sports including volleyball, basketball, wrestling, swimming and water polo can all be played in this facility.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Young people are not post racial. Young whites are more self hating than any other generation of whites before them. The media doesn&rsquo;t want a post racial society they want an anti-white society in which whites are systematically discriminated against.</p>
<p>Blacks recieve numerous forms of special treatment in America yet they still constantly complain about racism. Nothing will ever satisfy them. The more we give them, the weaker we appear and the more we are hated.</p>
<p>The media and the public schools promote black pride, mestizo pride and gay pride but if you are a white heterosexual male you are vilified and attacked. They never wanted a post racial society just an anti white one.</p>
<p>There can never and will never be a post racial society. Even among blacks those with lighter skin are considered more attractive. Have you noticed that most black radical leaders have lighter skin? Blacks with large amounts of white admixture have higher IQs and rise to leadership positions in black radical groups in many cases.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Post-racialism&rsquo; is a buzzword, part of this ridiculous contemporary jargon which includes &#8216;political correctness&rsquo; &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; and declarations of &#8216;the end of history&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mixing races is nothing new.  Is Brazil happily &#8216;post-racial&rsquo;?  Is Cuba or Puerto Rico happily &#8216;post-racial&rsquo;?  </p>
<p>The answer is no.  They&rsquo;re unhappily mulatto. </p>

		<p>Asian Indians are held to higher standards than whites when it comes to college admission due to our higher average SAT score and high performance in academic classes. </p>
<p>So when you look at a school that&rsquo;s majority Indian and Chinese, do the whites complain about the curriculum being &#8220;raciss&#8221; because they can&rsquo;t do as well as our kids can? Do the whites demand affirmative action? No, they don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Whites are the least racist race on the planet. Whites here in Cupertino, CA freely admit they move out when they have kids because their kids cannot keep up with the smart Asian kids. </p>

		<p>When or if White Americans become a minority and as time goes on an ever smaller minority, will those of Japanese and Chinese descent be happy about that, no I think not,they live now in a European hegemony and it affords them  whether they realise it or not some sort of protection, when White Americans are not around and they to are subject to physical and mental threatening behaviour of others,they will do their equivalent of White flight back to Japan and China, I am sure those Asians get my drift.</p>

I also see a lot of white couples with 3+ kids in my area.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean I take it as an indicator that whites everywhere are having that many(or we wouldn&rsquo;t see such a large decline in white children, even with the baby boomers aging).  </p>

		<p><i>As a soon to be retired college administrator, all I can say is that I see alot (sic) of racial interaction across ethnic groups on my college campus.</i></p>
<p>College is like la-la land   &mdash;   <i>ground Zero</i> in the PC culture war and anti-White reign of terror .  In real life, the races segregate themselves completely by housing pattern and at workplaces.  I am not welcome in black cliques at my workplace   &mdash;   and I don&rsquo;t want them in my white group as well.</p>
<p>Ask those white college kids in a few years how much they love and embrace diversity as they find lesser qualified blacks fawned over and offered high-paying employment upon graduation while they are passed over, not even afforded an opportunity to interview with employers.</p>
<p>I saw an entire room full of young Whites yesterday in Starbucks competing for one or two openings for jobs that pay (what?) $10.00/hour?  I suspect many were recent college graduates given the time of year   &mdash;   all looked desperate.</p>
<p>As anon #10 writes:  <i>a lot of them are surprisingly realistic about race. It&rsquo;s worth noting that the internet haunts of people this age are notorious for their racism.</i></p>
<p>Young Whites bear the brunt of AA.  Yes,  look at their internet haunts   &mdash;   where they can freely state that which would cost them dearly if stated openly in public.</p>

<p>Whites move away because YOU have moved in and YOU are favored in employment due to reverse racism against whites in Silicon Valley.  I know an engineer who was one of the first computer whizes in Northern California back in the 1970s.  He lost his job in Silicon Valley a few years back and can&rsquo;t find another.  He is vastly more qualified than any Asian, Indian or Chinese.  One of his best friends (and mine) the same age is a Japanese/American (white father, war bride wife), of similar qualifications, and he is thriving, hooked up with Chinese businesses, etc., and all because he looks the part.</p>
<p>In the past, when I have to rely on phone technical support and get an Indian, it has always been a quick discovery that they know less than I do.  All this Indian tech whiz hype is just that, hype created for recruiting a cheaper labor force, and displacing better qualified whites.  I never rely on such tech help, I find my help locally from whites, when I do need it, which is rare now.</p>
<p>The rest of your post represents the resultant ego trip that many Indians seem to possess as a result.</p>

<p>Wrong.  My parents are &#8220;Greatest Generation&#8221; members and very politically conservative, listen to Rush, etc.  Their beautiful, blond grand-daughter married a black.  They couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled with their mulatto great-grand children.  Even after said grand daughter divorced the black cad, who was having an affair with yet another white woman.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who is uniformly conservative on all issues. But when his daughter got knocked up by an unidentified black man, they took on raising the child like their own, and proud of it.  I guess abortion was out of the question.</p>
<p>I do agree on how the media and politics are making these sort of scenarios common.  If children are not going to be raised proud of who and what they are as white Euros, there isn&rsquo;t much future for any of us. But I also think that the loss of whites will cause a collapse of civilization.  It&rsquo;s already happening, and unaware whites participate.</p>
