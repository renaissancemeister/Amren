<p>The third-largest U.S. city lost 17 percent of its black population  &mdash;  181,000 people  &mdash;  in the past decade, according to the Census Bureau. In their place, Hispanics gained 25,000, or 3.3 percent. {snip}</p>
<p>In the city that drew waves of blacks during the Great Migration of the early 20th century, their descendants barely remain the largest racial or ethnic group, at 32.4 percent. Blacks earn less and are more likely to live in poverty than Hispanics, who make up almost 30 percent of Chicago, a city of 2.7 million that lost 6.9 percent of its population since 2000.</p>
<p>The reversal of fortunes for the two groups is echoed nationwide, where blacks have fallen to 12.6 percent of the total U.S. population of 308.7 million, and Hispanics have risen to 16.3 percent. Hispanics are also outpacing blacks economically: Their median household income rose 21.6 percent in the decade to $40,946, compared with $34,445 for blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Reversing Great Migration</strong></p>
<p>The population shift in Chicago is part of a nationwide phenomenon of blacks moving out of cities and into suburbs or reversing the Great Migration and returning to Southern U.S. states, William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a May 4 report.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a national trend of black suburbanization, a new generation of African-Americans who both have more opportunity and don&rsquo;t see their future living in cities, like their parents and grandparents,&#8221; Frey said in a telephone interview from Washington.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Fatter Wallets</strong></p>
<p>Hispanics also are strengthening their financial position at a faster pace than blacks. In Chicago, the median household income of Hispanics in 2009 was $41,802, up 14 percent over 2000, compared with $30,769 for blacks, up 6 percent over the same period, according to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey. The poverty rate for Hispanics in 2009 was 21.6 percent, compared with 31.7 percent for blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Business Graveyard</strong></p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t the only ones who have departed from Davis&rsquo;s neighborhood, which was devastated by the riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. His district also was once home to Sears, Western Electric, International Harvester and Allied Radio  &mdash;  &#8220;all of them gone,&#8221; Davis said.</p>

<p>Actually, I think it&rsquo;s more like the results of a deliberate but very quiet effort on the part of Chicago&rsquo;s civic elite to get blacks to move into suburban Cook and out of Chicago proper.  The housing developments that are replacing the Cabrini-Greens are supposedly mixed market rate and mixed subsidized rent, and it seems that the administration seems to be very picky on the kind of people that get to move in based on the latter category.  For now, anyway   &mdash;   It might break down in several years, and the Cabrini Green replacement will be just a vertically shorter version of what it replaced.</p>

		<p>Neither hispanics nor blacks have any economic clout.  They are both populations almost completely dependent on welfare.  All whites would have to do, to destroy both populations, at this point, would be to harden our neighborhoods (ie armed citizenry walking the streets) and cut off all welfare.  Almost all mexicans would leave the country after a very short time.  However, almost all blacks would DIE after a prolonged period of intense suffering intermingled with horrific behavior.  In fact, national coverage of such behavior is the only way to keep ultra-altruistic whites cooperating with the program.  That and any attempts at charity would be met with rape, robbery and murder.  Think Haiti without the presence of US troops to intervene.</p>
<p>So why the lies in this article?  And what is the grain of truth that makes this believable.  Blacks HAVE been &#8220;giving way&#8221; to mexicans in many neighborhoods.  That is a despicable euphemism for the fact that they are being ethnically cleansed.  But it&rsquo;s not economic clout that is moving them but a protracted pogrom of murder and violent intimidation.  In short, race war has broken out into OPEN war between mexicans and blacks and the blacks are losing badly.  You don&rsquo;t know about it because the war is not covered in the news, except tangentially.  A few individual incidents of &#8220;crime&#8221; are mentioned.  But the fact that large scale guerrilla warfare with daily assassinations, use of rape to intimidate neighborhoods and horrific crimes targeting groups like the elderly&hellip;.that&rsquo;s not being covered.</p>
<p>Of course, neither is the fact that blacks are attempting to open a second front in OPEN war, as opposed to the dirty war they&rsquo;ve waged for decades now.  Moving en masse to white neighborhoods and openly murdering whites for fun&hellip;..mob stealing, rioting etc.  Cities like Chicago have become unlivable.  And are well on their way towards (if I might be a wag and coin a new term here) detroitification.</p>

		<p>Blacks are nothing but the stormtroopers of neo-cons, marxists and liberals.  The blacks have been totally under the control of those groups since 1900 and the invasion of northern cities.</p>
<p>The neo-cons, marxists and liberals have turned their attention to hispanics, animals, earth worship and gay issues.  The blacks, having done their damage are on their way out, like mercanery soldiers dumped at the end of a war.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics are likely to be too busy clashing (like blacks do with blacks currently) to form any coalitions (other than democratic voting blocs) against whites. Hispanics are rather forthright about their opinions of blacks, and their frank appraisal is nearly uniformly unflattering.       </p>

		<p>Good news! And yes they&rsquo;ll take it lying down because they lack economic clout &amp; the time to amass it. Like their Caucasoid counterparts the E.European Gypsies, the Blacks will take anything lying down, even a Jim Crow revival but they smell the Whites&rsquo; fear and that is all that holds Whites back. </p>

		<p>Well that is typical for the Rust Belt. Even a large metropolitan area like Chicago can&rsquo;t escape job losses in the manufacturing sector of the nation&rsquo;s economy. I live outside of Cleveland, another Rust Belt fossil of a city. The state of Ohio has one of the highest tax rates out of all the states, yet &#8220;boasts&#8221; one of the worst economies outside of our neighboring state Michigan. </p>
<p>We have a Mississippi showcase with LA wannabe lineup of politicians, Democrat &amp; Republican. That is a sad combination. My old drill sergeant told me, &#8220;you can&rsquo;t polish a t***&#8221;. Yet in Ohio, &amp; throughout the old Rust Belt ghost towns in the Midwest, denial is stronger than ever. Too bad there&rsquo;s no market for that as a commodity. America would be rich again. </p>
<p>As far as the Hispanic boom, most will work. They will hold onto Spanish with a tight grip, but as I&rsquo;ve said before. I have more hope for the Spanish speakers than I do for the ebonics &amp; Arabic speakers. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a national trend of black suburbanization, a new generation of African-Americans who both have more opportunity and don&rsquo;t see their future living in cities, like their parents and grandparents,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Thats because their parents and grandparents have already gutted the cities, theres nothing left to &#8220;take&#8221;! Theres much more &#8220;opportunities&#8221; in the suburbs for them to steal, rob, rape, assault, murder and basically hustle\bully White folks. And those good White folks will be happy to pass laws to help them do it to prove they&rsquo;re not racisss. The chances of winning a ghetto lottery are also much better for them when living among Whites. Do the math - if you were black where would YOU live, the ghetto or around those good White folks that will kiss your butt till the day you die?<br>
Every time Whites build up a nice, clean, orderly, safe society, the &#8220;black undertow&#8221; always follows them and, over time, detroys it. Why do blacks WILLINGLY follow the very people that they dispise and perceive as wishing them harm? Whites KNOW that most blacks dispise them and wish them harm and therefore they don&rsquo;t move to black neighborhoods. NEVER has an area gone from White to black and saw improvement, or even stayed the same for that matter.  </p>

		<p>I live in one of those Chicago suburbs blessed with Black flight.  Of course the city fathers are just gitty about our city becoming more diverse.  We also have a high Hispanic population and I never thought I would see that as a blessing, but in this case, it may be.  Hispanics don&rsquo;t want to live around Blacks any more than Whites do.  Unlike Whites, they don&rsquo;t have that White guilt thing and they aren&rsquo;t nearly as emasculated as Whites.  From where I&rsquo;m sitting, the Hispanics are a mixed blessing.  Would I rather be in a city dominated by Whites?  You bethcha.  Like most people these days, I&rsquo;m stuck here.  It&rsquo;s at least some comfort that those Hispanics around me are just as repulsed by the Blacks pouring in, and more likely to fight them than the few Whites who are stuck here.</p>

		<p>California has its infamous,&#8221;Three Stikes an Your out&rsquo; law. But sending a felon to jail for life means they remain a forever burden to the tax-payer. To stem the tide of inner city blacks moving into you neighborhood I recommend getting organized and draft a ordinance that is a &#8220;Three strikes and your OFF&#8221; law. I believe Towns have the right to refuse town services ( rental assistance, heating assistance, etc, etc) to anyone with three or more felonies. I think this is something worth investigating.</p>

		<p>Look, Blacks need to understand how far behind they are,  before they can improve. What is realistically going to happen is even though Al Sharpton will win a law suit here and there, the fate of their destiny has been sealed. If they are unable to read the writing on the wall(and 50% are dropping out of high school, a good portion probably can&rsquo;t), they&rsquo;re done. There is no problem with Latinos, the only barrier is language. That&rsquo;s it. Imagine all of us knew Spanish, and they came in here and said &#8220;racism here and &#8220;racism&#8221;&#8221; there&#8221;, you would laugh. The Richest man in the world is a Mexican, albeit Arab. Being bilingual, I can honestly say there is no difference between them and whites. </p>

<p>Yes!  Exactly right!</p>
<p>I want to commend you for your prescient, spot-on, 100% correct commentary.</p>
<p>Too many here give blacks credit for &#8216;destroying White America&rsquo; when they (blacks) have neither the intelligence nor organizational ability to destroy a majority White America. </p>
<p>Blacks did not &#8220;move into White areas&#8221;;  they were placed there by judicial/government fiat, via Section 8 housing, at the same time Whites were being legislated against and held down by the government.  Blacks received their power only through the government    &mdash;   to murder, rape and rob innocent Whites and terrorize and destroy White neighborhoods.  The government showered blacks with unearned rights and privileges over Whites, not as a function of helping blacks, but to destroy Whites and White America.</p>
<p>Blacks have served their purpose and are being thrown under the bus.  Hispanics are now showered with   &mdash;   unearned rights and privileges over Whites, AA benefits, government money wrested from Whites and are being placed via Section 8 housing in White neighborhoods to&hellip;.</p>
<p>Hispanic votes are needed to keep the hostile elites in power and to continue the ongoing War on Whites. Hispanics have replaced black as the new favored &#8220;minority&#8221; and blacks are learning quickly what it feels like to be a dispossessed minority.</p>
<p>Expect lots of rioting and violence, and as others have stated: Let&rsquo;s have it!</p>

		<p>Yes, this is very true. The places of contention are inner ring suburbs where Blacks have followed Whites out supposedly for &#8220;better schools&#8221; - they are better for awhile, than not much better, the same.</p>
<p>The demographic shifts are much better for quality of life issues for those of us in the City and it&rsquo;s becoming more like Paris here when the inner city is richer, much whiter, the great parts of Chicago protected and the worse slums on the outskirts.</p>
<p>None of these demographic changes are good for the Republican party or Conservative politics as the once White suburbs once voted Conservative Republican to be against the big bad, very Black city. No more. But, the good news is that the great city of Chicago, like the great city of New York isn&rsquo;t going to die and become like Detroit or Algiers.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics are not qualitatively alike so the quantitative comparisons are irrelevant. Blacks are cohesive because of history, religion, and more recently, &#8220;liberal&#8221; or more correctly Statist ideology. Notice that these are all abstractions, and require maintenance of oral traditions to survive. Hispanics, and especially Mexicans, cohere due to the immediate real-world experience of a huge geographic and cultural area they can visit and regroup in. All this is obvious, but ignored by the MSM, who have a fixation of treating all non-whites as similarly minded &#8220;minorities&#8221; with grievances based solely on economic inequality with white people.<br>
Hispanics are definitely here to stay and here to lay claim to land they feel is theirs&rsquo;. Blacks seem to want no more than laying claim to their own souls; the idea of controlling territory is foreign, not in their history. Both present political challenges to the white power structure but the Hispanic looms much larger, in my opinion. I said &#8220;white power structure&#8221; advisedly since I feel it is the elites who have benefited from open borders policies. Beware of any libertarians or similar political affinities with no sense of territory; of course if you are Hispanic you may count on them just as Islamic militants count on the ACLU in their plan to install totalitarian thought control in the USA.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with Question Diversity&rsquo;s comments.</p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles vduring the Rodney King riots.  In my opinion, the riots were caused by the news media whipping up hate ala Hitler..  The media, especially the despicable Los Angeles Times was totally on the side of the rioters.  News helicopters desperately searched the area trying to find footage of White looters.</p>
<p>But very quietly while the riot was still going on Eli Broad and others who own S. California were quietly meeting.  The decision they made was (1) to fire the White chief of police and hire an affirmative action idiot.  (2) to stop hiring black government &#8220;workers&#8221; and start hiring hispanic government &#8220;workers&#8221;.  It has worked out well.  It took almost 30 years, but the hispanics have ethnically cleansed Los Angeles of many blacks.</p>
<p>Last year it was reported that the crime rate, especially the murder rate was the lowest since 1967.</p>
<p>The media ran many articles wondering why the crime rate lowered but never mentioned that the black percentage of the population was also lowered.</p>
<p>Of course the suburbs now have increased crime.</p>

<p>Ever heard of MS-13 gangs?  Latin Kings?  Notice how even more Hispanics equals a lower quality of life?  As more Hispanics have moved into my neighborhood over the years, it&rsquo;s because less safer and there are more cop cars patrolling and I am seeing more graffiti everywhere.  While not as problematic as blacks or black gangs, they are not something I want.<br>

		<p>White neighborhoods have to worry about blacks moving in, but Hispanic neighborhoods don&rsquo;t have that worry. Blacks move out when Mexicans move in. With that logic, move into a well kept up Hispanic neighborhood, and then there&rsquo;s no Black worries. Blacks avoid them like the plague. Something to think about.</p>

<p>More &ldquo;productive as citizens?&rdquo; Your definition of productive must be quite liberal. These people destroy anything and everything they come into contact with, including entire states. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never heard of Hispanics burning down their own neighborhoods, as blacks are wont to do. If I had to choose between the groups I&rsquo;d pick the Hispanics without hesitation. Ideally, I&rsquo;d rather not have to have either group in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>First off, they do riot and burn down their neighborhoods. But in any event, it&rsquo;s no major loss if they did, since their neighborhoods are filthy, with graffiti on anything that doesn&rsquo;t move, and sometimes on things that do move.   </p>
<p>You can have your Hispanics! As a White American, I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with them.<br>

&#8220;White neighborhoods have to worry about blacks moving in, but Hispanic neighborhoods don&rsquo;t have that worry. Blacks move out when Mexicans move in. With that logic, move into a well kept up Hispanic neighborhood, and then there&rsquo;s no Black worries. Blacks avoid them like the plague. Something to think about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A well kept up Hispanic neighborhood&hellip;.now that&rsquo;s an oxymoron if there ever was one.</p>
<p>Given the fact that I have lived in California my entire life, I have yet to come across a &#8220;well kept up&#8221; Hispanic neighborhood.  <br>

<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s amazing what 5 more IQ points can do.</p>

<p>I cannot believe these two comments. Yeah, lets move into Hispanic neighborhoods. That&rsquo;s the ticket! Please show me some well kept &#8220;hispanic neighbrohoods&#8221; without thousands of kids running and screaming all over the place. Gangbanger kids. Cars all over the place. Their music blaring at all hours. No, thank you.</p>
<p>Please show me all these brighter hispanics  who are productive without getting our benefits on the sly. Hispanics and blacks are two groups we do NOT need or want in our society.</p>

<p>So do whites. Southern California is filled with formerly white commmunities that are now overwhelmingly Mexican. </p>

		<p>Elder Cleavage and all those radical, militant big-mouthed blacks from the 60s must be spinning in their graves to see their folk being replaced by immigrants from another country.<br>

<p>Are you serious?  If hispanics do such a great job keeping up their communities, why do most look like Mexico?  Why are white californians fleeing that once great &#8220;sunshine state&#8221;?  Do you really think it&rsquo;s comfortable having all their kids running out and joining gangs and draining our social services the way blacks have been for 50 years now?  the more Hispanics that have moved in my neighborhood over the years, the less safe it is to go walking outside and in certain areas.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the racial hatred from Hispanics like I do blacks, I still don&rsquo;t want them here.  I want my country to stay majority white and in the control of whites, particularly white conservative men, just like it was when I was a kid.</p>

		<p>I live in the far out burbs of DC. As Montgomery County has paid to bring diversity from foreign lands, multi-generational blacks have moved further out in droves!  The black Americans don&rsquo;t want to live next to Mexicans or Asians, and surprisingly aren&rsquo;t too keen of recent African immigrants.  They can&rsquo;t move further out into white communities fast enough. So the premium (the white house tax) white families paid for good neighborhoods and schools was for nothing as more town homes and condos were built. </p>
<p>Have yet to understand the rush from the glorious diversity blacks exhibit. Shouldn&rsquo;t they love living with those lighter skin folk from all over the world?</p>
<p>Yet, blacks will get together with other groups if whites are the majority.  </p>
