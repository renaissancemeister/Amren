	<p>ABC&rsquo;s Claire Shipman: &#8220;There&rsquo;s also an economist at the University of Michigan who has studied diversity and decision making and has found that in every business decision diversity leads to better decisions. In other words, a group of all white men are not going to reach the best decisions.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s on the inside that counts. Unless we&rsquo;re talking about a White person. Then it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s on the outside that counts. No amount of Whites can ever be &#8220;diverse&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
Oh, and studies that show Whites need other races are good. Studies that show Whites accomplishing great things on their own are worse than Hitler.</p>
<p>White = Bad<br>
NonWhite = Good</p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t clowns like this or Wise Latina Sotomayor be obliged to produce at least one historically verifiable instance of this alleged non-white wisdom? In what actual, real-world &#8220;business decision&#8221; has this wisdom been manifest? Bueller?</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.in fact, everyone in business knows the exact opposite to be true.  So much so that, for any serious investor, you have to hide the &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  Why?  Because it is probably the one reliable guarantee of losing money.  Bottom line.  You see a black man in the room doing anything except serving coffee?  Better back out of the deal.  Your chances of losing your investment are VERY high.  Your chances of being outright stolen from are VERY high.  Even when everything looks well taken care of and tight, the chances of something random, unpredictable (yet always, curiously, tied to the &#8220;diverse&#8221; element) happening to wipe out the deal, are VERY high.</p>
<p>Everyone with any amount of money knows this.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem is that many people making such decisions today are employees, using other people&rsquo;s money.  They could care less that they are tossing it into a fireplace to burn.  They are more interested in running the company into the ground and opening their golden parachutes.  Perhaps that is the good decisions the article refers to made more often by &#8220;diverse&#8221; groups.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In other words, a group of all white men are not going to reach the best decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why our mongrel society, led by a mongrel government, heavy in women and &#8220;minorities&#8221; have been doing so increasingly well in the past 40 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just bursting with questions like, &#8220;Does the same principle hold true for other particular groups?&#8221;  or, &#8220;Do white men tend to act like blacks, or Hispanics, or women, when they are in their own identity groups?&#8221;  (My guess is that non-white men, more often favor themselves first).  Does this mean that the Scandinavian nations, (which have patriarchal parliamentary monarchies) represent the biggest national failures in the world?</p>
<p>Or is it that this researcher has found that the past 2,000 years of male dominated history has been a huge error? (Compared to&hellip;?)</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you love to see how this &#8220;study&#8221; was conducted?</p>
<p>As a white man who now knows the score, I don&rsquo;t want to be in any group that doesn&rsquo;t think my sort can make good decisions, and therefore, must be politically helped through &#8220;protected groups&#8221; who, safe from me, can best determine my destiny.</p>
<p>White identity NOW!</p>

		<p>Ya, I suppose a few hundred years of all white decision making (which led to some of the greatest steps forward for civilization, ya know, unlike Africa) is to be ignored. Typical selective memory the leftist race baiters employ in their bullying and misinformation campaign. Their day to reap what they sow is coming soon, the truth is being understood more and more and the lies are being seen for what they are. I await the day their glass house crumbles to the ground and the delusional left is left with the reality their entire existence was based upon a big fat lie. </p>

		<p>This should be self-evident to anybody.  Americans of almost exclusively white European lineage built the largest and most productive economy in human history, developed and harnessed nuclear power, have been leaders in medicine, all types of technologies, have created the most productive agricultural machine in the world, and the most powerful financial systems in history.</p>
<p>But think how much more rapidly this might have progressed with additional input from Africans, Central and South Americans, and a sprinkling of Australian aborigines.</p>

		<p> We need diversity in our companies for better decision making? Well considering the steady downward spiral of our companies with Affirmative Action set asides I don&rsquo;t see where he gets this idea from. I think if you look at the results you can only come to the conclusion that white decision making trumps diverse decision making.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm, very interesting. These are verifiable assertions are they not? Let&rsquo;s see the studies showing women hedge fund managers double the profits of male managers and do so horizontally, without ups and downs. Uh&hellip;wait a minute&hellip;isn&rsquo;t that impossible? Horizontal, magic, female fund managers. Pretty cool. Sign me up. Also, who is this University of Michigan economist who finds diverse boards make better decisions than white male boards?</p>
<p>BTW, Jared Taylor found the opposite of all these assertions to be true in his latest book, WHITE IDENTITY. And unlike Shipman, he named his sources.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t HE on TV?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Right. Never mind.</p>

		<p>The occasion for Claire Shipman&rsquo;s remarks was a special roundtable on Christiane Amanpour&rsquo;s news church show yesterday morning of women who reacted to the Anthony Weiner scandal.  I saw most of it, and I still have no idea what a man who spreads pictures of his body and his manhood all across the internet has to do with women corporate executives supposedly making better decisions than men.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re on the Weiner subject, guess how he won his first election:</p>

		<p>&#8220;In other words, a group of all white men are not going to reach the best decisions.&#8221; - I would have to agree, at least in some cases. The Founding Fathers could not agree to end slavery and send all Africans back to Africa, which they should have done at any cost. THAT would have been the best decision at the time. </p>

<p>In that addled brain of hers, I think she&rsquo;s gotten racial diversity confused with functional diversity, or having a range of professions, academic disciplines, backgrounds, etc.</p>

		<p>It probably shows my bias, in more ways than one, but I find the video less disturbing or upsetting when I found out they were focusing on gender rather than race.  At times, I have to agree, a little less testosterone in a decision making committee could be a good thing.  </p>

		<p>We are deeply disappointed in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s deplorable lack of response to this outrage!</p>
<p>He should have already posted the response on YouTube:</p>
<p>&#8220;The White Community is horrified by these outrageous and offensive comments by Claire Shipman, who happens to be a White woman who is married to the White media spokesman for our historic first African American president. These biased stereotypes of Whites as incompetent create a hostile and dangerously anti-White environment.  We hold ABC to a higher standard and demand they do the right thing and apologize for allowing Ms. Shipman to spew her hateful, hurtful,  and toxically racist rhetoric on your network.  Until she apologizes and resigns, we we&rsquo;ll continue organizing a White boycott of all ABC advertisers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor should have then emailed the link to all the producers of all news shows and demand that he be given an equal and fair opportunity to respond to her hate.   When hate is left undisturbed, it only grows, and we suffer all the more.</p>
<p>The time has come for Taylor to step up and get the exposure he deserves. Dang- even bald headed James Edwards has been on CNN more than once!  Taylor needs to catch up!</p>

		<p>First of all, what type of diversity?  Having a group of whites with diverse backgrounds, but who share a common goal will, indeed, reach a better decision.</p>
<p>But what about racial diversity?  Whay if the races have differnt goals? different apptitudes? different norms, tastes?  No, I don&rsquo;t think that will lead to a better decison.</p>
<p>If diversity is so great, then why force it on people.  Why force it on companies, schools and neighborhoods.  Why not make diveristy optional and let a neighborhood or company see for themselves what works best.</p>

As we now see it is the White MALE that has lost and by default so has the White woman&hellip;.so tell me again about that wonderful diversity you speak of and what a great thing it is.</p>
<p> I am an older woman and I have found that when women got the vote (and the blacks) that this country has gone downhill fast!  Why? Because for the most part, both groups are emotional cripples. Everything is based on their emotions and constant hand wringing over &#8220;injustices&#8221;.  As for the &#8220;white&#8221; men in charge for the last 40 to 50 years or so,(remember those pulling the strings) most of them are marxists to begin with.</p>

		<p>If diversity leads to better decisions then New York should be better governed than New Hampshire, and California should be better governed than Iowa.  I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Of course the video starts with the women talking about how bad all male leadership is and how much better off companies are if they&rsquo;re headed by women.  Well, I have no objection to women starting their own businesses but I&rsquo;ve worked in several small businesses in which all the founders and officers were white men and the businesses were managed just fine.<br>

		<p>What the heck (would rather use a saltier word) is it with us and &#8216;diversity&rsquo;? Is diversity the 11th commandment? It does us no good whatsoever. American pre-1960s was strong, safe, and prosperous. The Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, etc are fine without diversity too.

		<p>There are 53 countries in africa (including six island nations). Of these, only Ethiopia and Liberia were never colonized. All these countries have black governments and since colonisation ended around 70 years ago (varies from country to country) there will be very few black africans who have experienced White rule during their adult lifetime. Africa is a huge continent, blessed for the most part with clement weather, plenty of rainfall and abundant sunshine. There has been plenty of opportunity for these 53 countries to get together and decide who is best at growing rice and other grains or raising livestock. Which have minerals to be carefully exploited or timber to be managed for home consumption and for export. All these commodities could easily be traded within africa and so eradicate poverty and starvation. This has never happened and never will. This is an excellent example of &#8216;one colour&rsquo; management and lack of diversity so I suppose Claire Shipman has a valid point, including the paucity of black women holding positions of power in africa. Companies from &#8216;White&rsquo; nations are constantly trawling africa for herbs and similar sources from which to develop medication to treat a host of diseases, many of them tropical. Why has africa not done this? There are thousands of black scientists trained in White countries whose black populations constantly moan about racism and White domination but there is no evidence that any of them travel to africa to take advantage of what is an untapped local market for their expertise. It can only be that they shudder at the mere thought of living, working and doing business in a totally black run environment.</p>

		<p>  A certain type of radical gender feminist seems to turn almost any newsworthy event to the scripted denigration of white males. What does Congressman Weiner&rsquo;s misbehavior have to do with gender balance in employment and promotion? Haven&rsquo;t some of the major beneficiaries of affirmative action been white women? Why is there so much smoldering resentment of white males by many college educated liberal white women?  Shouldn&rsquo;t we be their partners not their adversaries?</p>

		<p>Since when is there no such thing as diversity among White men/women? But, of course we know this idiot is talking about RACIAL diversity, isn&rsquo;t she?  The downfall/destruction of America is when Whites were programmed to &#8220;think&#8221; we are all equal (today&rsquo;s misguided Christian doctrine) and that one race (Whites only) is no better than the other. Sorry, but the reality is just the opposite.</p>

		<p>This is a classic case of equivocation, or the fallacy of multiple meanings. Diversity of _viewpoints_ is not the same as diversity of _genetics_. By any sensible measure, the first can be helpful in making informed decisions, and of course harmful by the same ticket.</p>
<p>The second, where somebody has been promoted for the colour of their skin inevitably results in blacks promoted beyond their competence, with potentially disastrous results.</p>
<p>The fact that the woman doing this equivocation is educated indicates to me that she&rsquo;s either doing it quite deliberately or has been accredited on the basis of her gender and PC thinking. </p>

		<p>Read about this. Ridiculous beyond belife. So a mix of Cambodian, Somalian, and Hispanic ghetto guys will make a better decision than a group of white males with IQ&rsquo;s over 150 and lifetimes of experience?</p>
<p>Do these guys even listen to themselves? To draw the conclusion that different ethnicities overrules intelligence and experience; does that make sense even to the left?</p>
<p>And Claire Shipman&rsquo;s married to Jay Carney. Tell me the media and BO&rsquo;s staff don&rsquo;t hang out.</p>

		<p>So the Weiner &#8220;affair&#8221; might lead to new opportunities for women, according to this crew. However, neither Palin nor Bachmann was mentioned in the conversation.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sometimes more racial and gender balance can be a good thng.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is not what she said. Beside, if ther is &#8220;more racial and gender balance&#8221; in the group, it still does not overrule knowledge of the problem, experience, wisdom, common sense, and intelligence.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Having a group of whites with diverse backgrounds, but who share a common goal will, indeed, reach a better decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Have to disagree. Too  broad. If they are uneducated, hostile, corrupt, unintelligent and inxeperienced in the problem aqrea. they will not do as well. If that was true. the moon shot should/would have been planned by black felons, female housewives, Hispanic mariachi players, and Chinese ping-pong champions   &mdash;   all diverse backgrounds sharing the common goal of getting to the moon   &mdash;   instead of a group of white, male scientists. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to see some of that economist&rsquo;s research because by my thinking it&rsquo;s pretty darn hard to prove that a particular group made &#8220;better&#8221; decisions.  </p>
<p>How do you define better?  What kind of decisions were they making?  Moves on a chessboard?  Multiple choice tests?  Which route to take to the shopping mall at 3pm on a Tuesday?</p>
<p>Do people really fall for this stuff?  I tend to think most do not, but maybe somebody should do a study on THAT! :)</p>

		<p>Curious, &ldquo;Group of All White Men Are Not Going to Reach the Best Decisions&rdquo;.  But blacks and others decry whites for having attained an unfair advantage of power, influence and wealth.  And if not by IQ alone, then by making better decisions than other groups over the centuries.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;A Group of All White Men Are Not Going to Reach the Best Decisions&rdquo;.  Hmmm, imagine if he had instead said, &ldquo;A Group of All Black Men Are Not Going to Reach the Best Decisions&rdquo;.  The story would be about the author being pilloried by is academic peers.  </p>

		<p>Claire Shipman is no different than the &ldquo;wise Latina&rdquo; or any other individual (including our current President) who happens to despise the white man. Ironically, it makes you wonder what their thoughts are regarding our Constitution, given the Framers were a bunch of&rdquo; non-diverse&rdquo; white men, apparently incapable of &ldquo;reaching the best decisions&rdquo; due to a lack of &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the likes of Obama and Sotomayor (and many other within this administration and academia) despise our Constitution, since there were no &ldquo;wise Latinas&rdquo; around at the time to contribute their infinite wisdom and intellect to the formation of that document. <br>

		<p>&#8220;You see a black man in the room doing anything except serving coffee? Better back out of the deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not necessarily. If the Diversity holds a title like &#8220;VP for community outreach&#8221;, or is &#8220;Director of Corporate Relations&#8221;, you may be okay?  They are window-dressing to keep the Feds at bay, but aren&rsquo;t in a position to do any real harm.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a management course I took about ten years ago at my local community college. While the instructor was espousing the virtues of diversity I asked, &#8220;How it it good? In what demonstrable ways does diversity improve business? Can you show me studies on this?&#8221; He was completely speechless and finally had to admit that he didn&rsquo;t have any answer, other than, &#8220;that&rsquo;s what the textbook says.&#8221; I, of course, became a pariah for questioning the New Speak, politically-correct &#8220;wisdom&#8221; of the left.</p>
<p>I later researched this for myself. There are plenty of studies that demonstrate that diversity causes strife in the workplace and leads to poor outcomes. But few individuals or organizations have the courage to report these results.</p>
