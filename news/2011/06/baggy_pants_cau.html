<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Deshon Marman, a 20-year-old football star from San Francisco&rsquo;s Bayview neighborhood, was asked to pull up his sagging pajama pants before his U.S. Airways flight home  &mdash;  a flight to take him to his best friend&rsquo;s funeral. Marman&rsquo;s friend, David Henderson, was shot and killed on those same Bayview streets.</p>
<p>Marman told his mother (see video) that he at first refused, saying his hands were full. He then went to his seat, where he did pull up his pants, his mother said.</p>
<p>By that time, the pilot had ordered the plane evacuated. He then made a citizen&rsquo;s arrest, according to the airline.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The passenger refused to comply with instructions, so the captain exercised his right to make a citizen&rsquo;s arrest after passenger refused to deplane.</p>
<p>The airline also said they do not have a dress code beyond &#8220;appropriate, that doesn&rsquo;t offend passengers.&#8221;</p>

Seeing some &#8221; self-aggrieved&#8221; minority with his rear hanging out does &#8220;offend&#8221; me and probably most Americans. Thus, it appears the pilot was well within his rights and authority to demand this &#8220;passenger&#8221; pull up his pants and act like a human being.</p>

		<p>In response to one news article, a commenter, claiming to be an eye witness to the incident, stated the football star was asked four times not to enter the plane until he had adjusted his pants, and, still refusing to do so, he entered the airplane anyway, pushing past airline personnel. [Hence the battery charge.]  Once in his seat, the football star continued to refuse.  The football star&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s lachrymose whitewash [pun intended] is a very good example of how the ghetto mentality works, even more so than her son&rsquo;s in your face droopy pants.  One purpose of the droopy pants style among black men and teens is to carry the pathos of the ghetto about the wearer and to passersby.  It&rsquo;s the hood front and center, up close and personal, especially for whitey.  In this, it is wildly [wildingly?] successful.  Hence, I usually go to DEF CON 3 around blacks; wonder why.   </p>

		<p>He said he would have done things differently he would have complied to the rule. The pants are low for a reason the trend is a statement of defiance and a coded message. The message&#8221; kiss my a**&#8221;.  The same trend of walking in the street is an act of defiance. Next time he will dress appropriately . Good for the captain he made a stand and he should be supported. Get ready!</p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t around to see it but I long for the time when people got dressed up when flying.  I would love to have seen men in nice suits with a hat and a vodka tonic with women in dresses.  I see far too many people of all races dressed like utter slobs, wifebeaters and flip-flops seem de rigueur unfortunately when visiting an airport.   </p>

		<p>Note the charge of &#8220;battery&#8221; is buried more than halfway through the video! This is obviously about far more than &#8220;sagging&#8221; pants. Moreover, they apparently weren&rsquo;t even pants, but &#8220;pajama bottoms?!&#8221; Who goes out of the house, let alone gets on an airplane filled with presumably civilized people in their bed-clothes for heavens&rsquo; sake? </p>
<p>As usual, more to this tale than meets the eye - and the obligatory apologist Black momma&rsquo;s twaddle, of course. </p>

		<p>After watching the tape, is it any wonder why &#8220;Deshon&#8221; is what he is? I&rsquo;d like to look into the background of this June Cleaver of the ghetto mamma of his just see how much she charged the  taxpayer to raise this fine young man. I&rsquo;d like to also look into the background of this &#8220;best friend&#8221; of his that was &#8220;shot and killed on those same Bayview streets&#8221;.</p>
<p>These thugs do this to PROVOKE a &#8220;racial&#8221; incident, also known as a ghetto lottery setup. Having witnessed the spectacle on several occasions before, I can just visualize him &#8216;strutting&rsquo; on the plane -  huge carry-on over one shoulder, huge racial chip on the other shoulder, tons of &#8216;jury&rsquo; on, his gold &#8216;playa&rsquo; sunshades on and, oh - talking loudly on the phone of course. My only surprise here is that there was no mention of the infamous blond White girl on his arm that joined in. </p>
<p>U.S. Airways will of course have to grovel and meet with the &#8220;Rev&#8221; Jack$on and $harpton to arrange the &#8216;payment of penalties&rsquo; for &#8216;dissen&rsquo; an upstanding brotha. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder gets involved in this.  </p>

		<p>NPR and most of the media reporting this story are spinning it a completely different way, that he was arrested for baggy pants.  NPR doesn&rsquo;t even report that all the other passengers were evacuated from the plane.  He wasn&rsquo;t arrested for baggy pants.  He was arrested for refusing to leave the plane, for refusing to follow the pilot&rsquo;s instructions.</p>

		<p>This story is the classic example of a lie being on the other side of the world before the truth can get out of bed to put its boots on.  You have to watch the video to see that the pilot arresting Mr. Marman (as far as that goes, I think Federal law gives pilots certain implicit law enforcement powers, so this wasn&rsquo;t a &#8220;citizens arrest&#8221;), had to do with battery, not the sagging pants.</p>
<p>Why do they tell us at all that he played football?  Is that supposed to make him exempt from statutory criminal law?</p>

<p>His mother said baggy pants are a trend. Hopefully whites saying, &#8220;enough, already,&#8221; will also become a trend.</p>

		<p>In general a private business such as an airline may determine the terms of contract.  Such terms may include proper dress.  </p>
<p>&#8220;No shirt, no shoes, no service!&#8221;</p>
<p>The passenger&rsquo;s contractual license to be seated on the airline may be revoked upon failure to comply with the terms of agreement.  If this black passenger didn&rsquo;t want to be bound by the dress code, he should have chosen an alternative means of travel.</p>
<p>Once the license is revoked, the airline may use reasonable force to remove the passenger who is now deemed a trespasser.  Physical resistance of such privileged force constitutes batter by the trespasser against the airline.</p>

		<p>One commenter made the (incorrect) statement, that &#8216;droopy drawers&rsquo; means, &#8216;kiss my *ss&rsquo; on the part of blacks.</p>
<p>Nope. When this trend first began manifesting itself, I was told by an ex-con, that this form of (un)dress arose in prisons, where the (submissive) homosexual was &#8216;advertising&rsquo; his wares, and able to &#8216;drop trou&rsquo; for their &#8216;lovers,&rsquo; and that this then became a &#8216;fashion statement&rsquo; outside of prison.</p>
<p>It was not four years later, that I read many of the &#8216;best and brightest&rsquo; in the &#8216;Black Church&rsquo; scene were HIV positive, for many of them were doing the &#8216;down low&rsquo; with the same rationale as those poor sick kids locked in an all-male hothouse of perverts, and animalistic tendencies.</p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s, people remember men wearing earrings in either left or right ears, and the paisley handkerchief protruding from back pockets. This, too, was a &#8216;gay&rsquo; signal, indicating which &#8216;side of the fence&rsquo; one was on, in the heady days before AIDS.</p>
<p>As a professional musician, who has watched numbers of his colleagues die of this disease of choice, and not genes, who (thank God) married a woman who has made my monogamous marriage of twenty years one of the few stable &#8216;relationships&rsquo; among my musical peers, I felt I needed to point out (again) that perversion is poisoning our culture, and we ignore it at our peril.</p>

		<p>I find it very hard to believe that all this was caused just because some idiot refused to pull up his pants (pajamas?) a bit. Must be a whole lot more going on here. Not that the MSM will ever tell you.</p>
<p>Offhand, on the general issue of saggy pants, who cares? If blacks want to walk around looking like such complete fools, let them. There have been a number of cases where they got caught because of this. </p>

		<p>I can see, and would bet, that the pilot will be suspended without pay until this is settled by the airline ponying up the usual agrieved payment (bribe) and the pilot dutifully apologizes in public and yet mo money changes hands with the miscreant and the usual suspects (Jackson and Sharpton) get their pound of Whitey!</p>

I think you are absolutely right about this. The captain  is not just another &#8220;citizen&#8221;;  he is the law on his plane.</p>
<p><i>Why do they tell us at all that he played football? Is that supposed to make him exempt from statutory criminal law?</i></p>
<p><br>
Exactly! Does that make him special?  Who gives a bleep that he plays football?  So what?  Just what does THAT have to do with anything?</p>
<p>The media tell us that race is not mentioned in arrest incidents because it is irrelevant.  Well, how is playing football considered to be relevant?</p>

		<p>I fully support this method of Black self-expression!  The more non-Whites speak their own languages, have their own clothing styles, and maintain their own manners, the less likely they are to mix with Whites.  Those who want Mexicans to speak English or Muslim women to not wear head scarfs just haven&rsquo;t thought the matter thru.</p>
<p>As for the baggy pants style of African American youth: it has always struck me as clownish to the extreme.  In fact, if I was to design a clothing style meant to embarrass, demean, and signal out it&rsquo;s wearers; I could hardly do better than what these youths have chosen for themselves!<br>

<p>There is something wrong about this story.  The reporter couldn&rsquo;t even get it straight.  If he is a student in New Mexico, returning home from there, and he was arrested IN SAN FRANCISCO, that means he was arrested UPON ARRIVING at SF, not departing. </p>
<p>He was removed from the plane and the plane was evacuated?  But they all would have been leaving the plane anyway, upon arrival.</p>
<p>He had already completed his trip!  Something must have happened, on the plane, during the trip.</p>

<p>Over-reacted? Nope. Not to decent law abiding passengers and citizens. Bravo for the Captain!</p>
<p> That moron does NOT want to obey ANY rules set by the White man. One reason they cannot abide by our rules and norms is because they are BLACK! They are a different species altogether.</p>
<p>ANYWHERE we go we have to obey certain rules and laws. It is called being civilized and creating some sort of order so we can all be free from these thugs.  That idiot just wanted to act tough and DELIBERATELY stick it in the White mans face as usual. All the other decent passengers are suppose to put up with and sit next to these thugs/creeps? NO, a thousand times NO!</p>
<p>Of course he will sue, that is one reason they do this stuff DELIBERATELY. His stupid &#8220;momma&#8221; will make sure of that. </p>

		<p>Headline in video at 2:48 states &ldquo;Baggy pants football player arrest&rdquo;.  This has nothing to do with baggy pants, it has to do with exposure and odd, suspicious behavior.  <br>
As for mom saying, &ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s a trend, all boys do it&rdquo;, if only sexting celebrity Congressman Anthony Weiner had thought to have his mom use that defense&hellip;  <br>
Inappropriate behavior risks stereotyping appropriately for other maladies.  If one can&rsquo;t wear pants at a level that is within norms, what else might be going on?  Change pants to pajama bottoms, and unwillingness to hike them up could be considered as a disturbed person.  I would think the captain has the duty to err on the side of safety.  <br>

		<p>Eve if we didn&rsquo;t know the race of the prep, why is it one would surmise it is an Afro-American person?  Not black, but Afro-American.  What is the message?  Freedom of expression is fine, but when it indicates strange and potentially unstable behavior, the Captain must consider the safety of the plane and its passengers.  </p>

<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know what really happened on the plane. You don&rsquo;t get arrested for your clothes.  (A battery charge?) Obviously there was considerably more to this story.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s only because you&rsquo;ve become so accustomed to whites underreacting. And remember that there&rsquo;s a battery charge involved (see post # 2)&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t followed reports in the mainstream media, but are they exploring what the battery charge is about? (I&rsquo;m betting the MSM is not, since to do so would create the kind of story the MSM generally tries to avoid in these situations&hellip;an ACCURATE story).</p>

Quite. U.S. Airways and the passengers should be feeling all warm and fuzzy for the privilege of absorbing whatever small costs were involved in this educational epiphany for Deshon. One hopes that U.S. Airways will sponsor a reunion of the passengers and crew so they can celebrate their contribution to Deshon&rsquo;s turning his life around and taking his first step on the path of understanding and enlightenment. No child left behind, and a (putative) mind is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

We have a black who chooses to make up his own rules and show his body in a very offensive way.<br>
Now he is removed from the plane.</p>

The new American laws plainly state whatever a black wants to do should be okay to everyone.<br>
Everyone except RACISTS that is.<br>
When are we going to tell these throwbacks Enough is Enough,.<br>

		<p>From Baycity news: <br>
Marman, who was boarding Flight 488 to Albuquerque, N.M., was instructed by airline crew members several times to pull up his pants to cover his underwear, both before he boarded and on the plane, according to San Francisco police Sgt. Michael Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Marman allegedly refused to pull up his pants and when he sat in his seat, he pulled them all the way down, Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>Eventually the plane&rsquo;s captain told other passengers on the aircraft to deplane, ordered Marman to leave the plane and then placed him under citizen&rsquo;s arrest for trespassing after he refused the order, according to Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Marman was escorted off the plane by police and then allegedly resisted officers when they tried to handcuff him. One officer received a cut to his hand and a sprained knee in the struggle.</p>
<p>U.S. Airways spokesman Andrew Christie said Thursday, &#8220;While U.S. Airways does not have a specific dress code, we ask our customers to dress in an appropriate manner to ensure the safety and comfort of all of our passengers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was arrested for battery against an airline employee. But the governmedia<br>
 with Al and Jesse and his mother are making it about the pants and race, which is all they are capable of.</p>
<p>Though, I understand why people want to wear flip flops and wife beater tank tops at the airport, to not be singled out for pat-downs and screening (like that Baywatch woman was singled out), and for the ease of removing your shoes for shoe bomber checks. They really ought to have a blacks-only airline which they must use (when flying anyway), but they never will unless we re impose segregation, because all this business with this thug is for the sole purpose of his mom winning a ghetto lottery. </p>
<p>We should stand by the airline and pilot when they start getting attacked, we can not let them be beaten down and made to apologize.<br>

<p><br>
 I very much doubt it. Awareness, self-awareness in particular, are simply not traits of blacks. They seem to have no capacity for introspection or being self-reflective. They are more emotional and impulsive then anything else. Even if a few of the more thoughtful or insightful ones WERE aware, I doubt they would even care. I honestly believe that blacks simply have a different psychological framework then other people.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s very easy for YOU to say. Don&rsquo;t forget that pilot is responsible for the safety of everyone on board that airplane; the passengers, flight personnel, everyone (including himself). He also is responsible for the plane itself, making sure it flys, takes-off and lands safely. He has a schedule to maintain and has to consider weather and flight conditions too. He also has to interact with flight and ground control and be aware of all flight traffic. Then there is all the security issues since 9/11. Have you ever flown a large plane? IT&rsquo;S A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILTY! Do you really think this heavily burdened pilot needs or wants the distraction caused by this idiot? Any reasonable person would have complied with the perfectly reasonable request made to them and that would have been the end of it. But this kid had to be a smart*** with a false sense of entitlement.</p>
