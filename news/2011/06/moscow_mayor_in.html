			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Balmforth, Radio Free Europe, June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Unnerved by nationalist violence that broke out in downtown Moscow late last year, the city government has launched a well-funded campaign to combat xenophobia in the Russian capital.</p>
<p>The 110 million-ruble (nearly $4 million) effort will include an advertising campaign under the slogan &#8220;Don&rsquo;t support racism,&#8221; a series of roundtables, a website, and six documentary films celebrating cultural difference.</p>
<p>Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin signed the program into law last week. The move appeared to be a sharp break from Sobyanin&rsquo;s predecessor, Yury Luzhkov, who was widely criticized by rights activists for doing little to fight racist attacks.</p>
<p>Dmitry Orlov, general director at the Agency for Political and Economic Communication, says massive nationalist riots that broke out in Manege Square near the Kremlin in December convinced the authorities that the problem of xenophobia needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that the authorities are seriously perplexed by the events at the Manege, by the need to increase tolerance and to reduce interethnic tension,&#8221; Orlov says. &#8220;I think the sincerity of their aims is confirmed in the fairly significant amount of funds being put toward it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In April, the Moscow City Court banned the Movement Against Illegal Migration, a group linked to the violence in Manege Square.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;On The Rise&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Fears of a new wave of nationalist violence spread last week following the assassination of former army Colonel Yury Budanov in Moscow on June 10. Budanov became a hero to nationalist groups when he was convicted of kidnapping and strangling a Chechen girl in 2003. He was released on parole in 2008.</p>
<p>In anticipation of potential trouble, police beefed up security at Moscow&rsquo;s central squares on the Russia Day holiday weekend. They also detained a dozen nationalists for attempting to commemorate Budanov&rsquo;s killing on Manege Square.</p>
<p>Mukhammad Amin Madzhumder, president of the Federation of Russian Migrants, welcomed the new anti-xenophobia program but stressed that the city has had a poor record on the issue thus far.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a very high level of xenophobia in the Russian capital,&#8221; says Madzhumder. &#8220;Everyone knows that assault, murder, and humiliation takes place on a massive scale. Further, there is no broad informational work among the youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds: &#8220;The people who use the young in their various nationalist organizations take no responsibility. The Moscow government is inactive. Surely these extremist organizations need to be punished and liquidated. In the meantime, xenophobia and extremist violence is on the rise.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Can It Work?</strong></p>
<p>Likewise, Aleksandr Verkhovsky, director of the Moscow-based Sova Center, which monitors ethnic attacks, warned that the experience of &#8220;ineffective&#8221; past anti-xenophobia programs does not bode well for the new one. He added, however, that no program to date has been as well funded as the current effort.</p>
<p>Verkhovsky says the new program&rsquo;s success will largely depend on how well it is implemented, specifically the 22 million ruble ($788,000) allocation for social advertising.</p>
<p>He also questioned the utility of some parts of the planned campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some cases, the ideas themselves are not very good. For instance, it is very popular here to organize artistic events and festivals of the arts of various peoples as a way of fighting for tolerance,&#8221; says Verkhovsky. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think this is going to have any impact on the level of tolerance whatsoever. If people don&rsquo;t like someone, then it is not because they sing and dance badly, but because of something completely different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program also promises to support events on holidays of different cultures and confessions and organize anti-xenophobia events, the daily &#8220;Vedomosti&#8221; reported, quoting city officials.</p>
<p>Local authorities also aim to make it harder for employers to hire illegal foreigner migrants for low-pay jobs, &#8220;Vedomosti&#8221; reported. Officials also plan to reach out to legal migrant workers to help them adapt to what they describe as Moscow&rsquo;s &#8220;cultural norms.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Break With Recent Past</strong></p>
<p>Two months ago, security services in Moscow uncovered what they called an &#8220;underground town&#8221; of 110 illegal migrants living in a bomb shelter. Officials said that the migrants were making needles and blades for sewing machines.</p>
<p>Late last year, Sobyanin said &#8220;several million&#8221; migrant workers were living in Moscow, although only 250,000 are officially registered to work. Last year approximately 10,000 illegal migrants were deported from Russia.</p>
<p>Orlov says Sobyanin&rsquo;s administration is distancing itself from Luzhkov&rsquo;s hard-line approach to migrants and instead is offering a mix of carrots and sticks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t heard announcements from Sobyanin or any of the bureaucrats in City Hall while Sobyanin&rsquo;s been in charge that could be described as intolerant or aggressive toward one nationality,&#8221; Orlov says.</p>
<p>According to the Sova Center&rsquo;s statistics, 11 people have been killed in racially motivated attacks in Russia so far this year.</p>

		<p>First, I want to say that I am against violence. I believe that violence should be addressed and stopped.</p>
<p>However, as a woman of Russian descent, I am very concerned that the Russian government will crack down on peaceful activist groups that fight against the illegal alien invasion and groups that want to maintain the Russian culture. This I fear is the main reason for the sudden desire to address this issue.</p>
<p>Any attempt by a Russian to protect his national heritage will be met with cries of racism and xenophobia from the liberal oriented government officials and the media. </p>
<p>The Russian people will lose their country if they give up the fight. They must not back down.</p>
<p>Mukhammad Amin Madzhumder, president of the Federation of Russian Migrants, said &ldquo;There is a very high level of xenophobia in the Russian capital. Everyone knows that assault, murder, and humiliation takes place on a massive scale. Further, there is no broad informational work among the youth.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s amazing how freely foreigners accuse the host country of atrocities but do not look at how their own people contribute to the atmosphere that causes it. Violence is wrong no matter who does it.<br/>

		<p>I think russia is a little past the point where a good propaganda campaign can sway people on the immigration issue.  Basically, large numbers of russians are willing to go out, night after night, in packs, and murder any non-whites that cross their paths&hellip;..and for good reason I might add.  It&rsquo;s retaliation against ethnic rape gangs and the like.</p>
<p>The punishment for such behavior, assuming the person is executed extrajudicially, by the cops, are lengthy prison sentences that involve daily beatings with baseball bats (google this for some good video documentation of the actual beatings&hellip;.with actual baseball bats).</p>
<p>My point is, one must be truly dedicated to go out and do this in the face of such harsh punishment.  Russia has thousands and thousands of such people.</p>
<p>Only a matter of time before they overthrow that government.  I suspect, Sobyanin will face a quick hanging in the wake of such.</p>

		<p>Are any of the Amren posters aware of even one non-white country that is so obsessed with &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and altruism toward foreigners?</p>
<p>I am beginning to doubt that Whites will have any type of meaningful existence on this earth after about only one more generation.</p>
<p>Even with the staggering level of hatred, resentment and barbaric violence against Whites by non-whites that increases at a more rapid rate every year, we are still obsessed with trying to make these other races like and respect us - this will never happen. </p>

		<p>Russian losers.  Why don&rsquo;t they march in the street demanding that he &#8220;tolerate&#8221; a foreigner immediately taking over his job and neighborhood?</p>
<p>These elite trace traitor mayors must be forced to feel the consequences of their moral abstractions and ideas.  Moral action and virtue in conformity with &#8220;tolerance&#8221; means those Whiteys who say we must embrace Diversity must immediately first SURRENDER THEMSLEVES TO DIVERSITY.</p>
<p>Until the top elite volunteers for the pain and degradation they force upon us, we are acquitted for xenophobic racism and Whites Only nostalgia and random acts of racially motivated prejudice (now habitual).</p>
<p>Their inaction vindicates our cause.</p>

		<p>Whats wrong with this? Russia is a &#8216;multinational&rsquo; country with 80% non-Russian minorities. Not by virtue of immigration, but because of past Russian empire building.</p>
<p>Furthermore there are millions of Russians living in what is called the &#8216;near abroad&rsquo;. Kazahkstan for one is about 25% Russian.</p>
<p>By the way this is the Moscow mayor, Sergey Sobyanin:<br/>

		<p>Such Idiocy.</p>
<p>The only thing _classes_ of people have that can give them dreams of rising beyond their station is a sense of elitism as co-identity with the race-as-nation whose status &#8216;above all others&rsquo; their wealthy class represents.</p>
<p>You make it clear that that shared identity is gone by importing the poor&rsquo;s racial replacements (who tear the place up) and thus that there is no nation worth working for as an eventual (by random genetic lottery of pulchritude or multi-generational cumulancy of hard work) inheritance and OF COURSE you will _implode_ that country.</p>
<p>Because class based differentials in quality of life are enormous.</p>
<p>Let it hear be said that the elites depend on the professional classes in every western nation to secure the steady running of that nation&rsquo;s economy.  And the professional classes all rise up from the underclass because that&rsquo;s the only way to keep the system from becoming top heavy in social rewards for backbreaking labor.</p>
<p>Genetics show not all ethnic and race groups are up to the task of this effort but that some, by procreating out of all control, in fact ruin the economic and social value system by making it _bottom heavy_ until the society sinks into entropy.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that whites especially are _repulsed_ by the implication that they cannot reach high enough to join their own (beautiful, wealthy, respected) whites.</p>
<p>But must intermarry and accomodate foreign ethnies, just to hold their own status against social invasion from below.  This is particularly insulting since it is statistically clear that ONCE YOU HAVE MONEY your class has high heritability coefficient with _being white_.</p>
<p>It never fails to amaze me how we have proven that race includes heritable values for IQ, social cohesion and personal morality.  But nobody realizes that the correlative values for _class_ with race are even higher.  Because the wealthy get to choose whom they have kids with from a much higher quality pool of white candidates.</p>
<p>Whites want to become &#8216;more white&rsquo;.  And they set their mark by the color of the skin, the beauty of the face and the _wealth as social status_ of elites who are OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE.</p>
<p>This is why racism is not &#8216;wrong&rsquo;.  This is why poor dumb whites will not admit that classism is &#8216;wrong&rsquo;.  The slave wants to join the master.  Wants to be accepted by him.  Because we have that common bond.  That genetic inheritance.</p>
<p>Our elites are the proof that racism works.  And we want their class status so badly that we allow them to do horrible things to boot-on-neck suppress us in rising to their level.</p>
<p>But I think this is the breaking point.  For if being white is no longer allowed as an identification factor for success.</p>
<p>Then being high-SES rich is no longer an excuse for drubbing lower classes -because- they are white.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that this &#8216;shattered allegiance coming back to bite you&rsquo; fact of life is the last certainty that the last upper class person living comes to realize.</p>
<p>That you do not break the tie that binds:  Blood.</p>

		<p>Normally I am against violence, but not in this case.</p>
<p>How long are people supposed to wait until they fight back? Russia is being invaded. Muslims already make up some 20%, largely illegally. They are extremely violent toward native Russians, and routinely cheat them and often kill them.</p>
<p>So are Russians supposed to do nothing? How far does anti-violence go? As long as there is a way to avoid harm, I am all for peace. But once your enemy has his hand at your throat and choking the life out of you all bets are off. Get a club and beat him to death before he murders you.</p>

		<p>@MissWhitey&hellip; just a few peaceful political organizations that are against illegal immigration exist in Russia today. Many have been banned and the largest, DPNI (Movement Against Illegal Immigration) was banned last April. Russian Nation Unity, I Am Russian, Rusky Obraz and NSO (National Socialist Society) have all been banned as well. There are over 2000 patriots in prison as we speak, nearly 10 &#8220;have mysteriously committed&#8221; suicide. </p>
<p>While most people do not like violence, when NSO and their militant organization existed there was much less crime and much less immigration into Russia. Terrorist acts, to remind you of some, Beslan, Metro bombings, Apartment bombings and theatre massacre, came to a stand still. </p>
<p>@ Wayne&hellip; Yes there are over 160 ethnicities in Russia. Most are in remote regions, some are less than 200 people and over 40 of the ethnicities considered to be criminal and violent are from the Caucasus regions. Russia is still nearly 83% white. The next largest ethnic group in Russia are the Tartars with 3.8% of the population. Currently Russian is next to America in the number of illegal immigrants with in her borders, with numbers totaling over 10 million. Note Russia&rsquo;s total population is 140 million, so percentage wise they have more. </p>
<p>As well when one speaks of the various tribes in Russia do not forget that there are over 90 different Ameri-indian ethnicities in America, but when is the last time you saw a Tetawken? </p>
<p>What people do not understand that in any nation there has to be a dominate culture, a dominate language. If the minorities start getting rights as they did in America then they will be able to vote themselves into power and will distribute the resources to their own people. Remember America used to be 85% white and now is around 52% (Nordic/Anglo). We have seen how tolerance, integration and civil rights have worked here. </p>

		<p>What a shame!</p>
<p>Many across the Anglosphere held the belief that Eastern Europeans were somehow going to remain a bastion of whiteness for the future.</p>
<p>Sadly, I fear we are now under attack on ALL fronts. Total war has been waged via immigration. Where now will our future hopes lie?</p>

		<p>Russia will survive bc Putin isn&rsquo;t importing refugees and it isn&rsquo;t easy to obtain Citizenship for non-Russians. Post #5 by Wayne puts it in perspective: 30% of Kazkhstan &amp; Estonia and 1/10 C.Asians are Russians, so Moscow has to play ball. Not to worry bc one day before Putin dies, the USSR border will be revived.</p>

		<p>Highduke one does not have to have citizenship to be in a country. Over 1 million a year walk right into Russia. Oil prices have made life better in Russia, yet still over 65,000 Russian women a year marry a foreigner and leave the motherland. So between those coming and those going, what is left in Russia has hell to put up with. </p>
<p>Putin has enough to handle internally. Expanding borders is what created the problem to begin with. </p>
<p>@10 The Russian Orthodox Church is partly to blame also. They not longer see the issue of ethno and anyone can be Russian Orthodox now. </p>

<p>Sometimes it seem that Russia still has the same oppressive attitude and punishments it had during the Cold War.</p>

		<p>Westerners don&rsquo;t actually realize that campaigns don&rsquo;t work in Russia, and that no one takes Sobyanin&rsquo;s efforts and the lobbists that order such propaganda, seriously.</p>
<p>In Russia, it&rsquo;s just a good way to pull a nice amount of money through the laundry. Ironically enough, it&rsquo;s good. Where in Europe and US such &#8220;anti-xenophobia&#8221; rallies would be put to the work, actually funded and realized through the efforts of zealous libtards, here it&rsquo;s just monetary, financial interest and nothing will be done. The poison won&rsquo;t spread. I can say this as a Russian nationalist, it doesn&rsquo;t even enrage me, because in the end, the idea and campaign won&rsquo;t amount to anything.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this feint was announced only a week after an violent, ethnic stand off between Dagestanians and native citizens of a northern Kobryalovo township near St. Petersburg during the celebrations of the Constitution Day on 12th of June. Funny that no media outlets mentioned that a few dozen of Muslims  attacked a peaceful public gathering which resulted in a mass fight between Russians and Dagestanians.</p>
<p>I think, what modern Russia really needs, in order for an ethnic war not to break out, are campaign for anti-Russophobia. The immigrants don&rsquo;t realized they&rsquo;ll be obliterated sooner or later if this trend and their cockiness goes on unpunished. </p>

<p>Finally, someone who knows a bit of Russian history.  We can&rsquo;t exactly filter everything through our own historical filters.  The Russian Empire and then the USSR, were large multi-national, multi-racial, and multi-ethnic empires.  Russian live just about everywhere in those countries and exert a great deal of influence/power.  The Russian mafia is also very powerful in them.  The price of that is what we see.  </p>
<p>But when I see the photo you provided, it is easy also to see that the mayor is heavily Mongolian/eastern in his racial makeup.  So even with this seeming hypocrisy, it must be understood that racially white Russians must rule Russia, because filling it with non-Russians will cause it to implode.  If that happens, the entire region - and its a large chunk of earth&rsquo;s geography, will fall into chaos.  Ultimately, we must accept that human history resulted in certain groups (all white) controlling most of the world because it was evolutionary destiny.  As we attempt to undo the natural result politically, we guarantee harm to all, in the Roman sense.</p>

<p>  I fully support your view Miss Whitey. Russia has every right to limit immigration to their country to preserve their unique racial and cultural heritage. </p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t know where Wayne is getting his 80% non-Russian minorities figure.  Here&rsquo;s Russia&rsquo;s ethnic breakdown from the current CIA Factbook: &#8220;Russian 79.8%, Tatar 3.8%, Ukrainian 2%, Bashkir 1.2%, Chuvash 1.1%, other or unspecified 12.1% (2002 census)&#8221; There are a higher percent of ethnic Russians in Russian than whites (down to 60%) in the United States. </p>

		<p>Im not sure why anyone would want to immigrate or live in Russia. People struggle there to make very low wages, and Moscow is one of the most expensive cities in the world. To make matters worse, average citizens are constantly bullied and assaulted by organized crime and corrupt police. Even driving a car there is suicidal. The highways connecting cities with rural areas are often only one lane. People drive at speeds 100 mph + and simply crash into each other head-on.  Yes, foreigners commit violent crimes, but there are already pre-existing problems. I wish the best for Russia, but right now, it is not the promised white homeland you might imagine. It&rsquo;s a very dangerous third world country.</p>

<p>Great post!  It is always good to get some hard stats up for people to read.</p>
<p>While you are at that, I&rsquo;d like to encourage people to read the history of Russia and the regions south of them that they invaded, conquered and ruled harshly for hundreds of years.  The Caucases in particular have been ravaged repeatedly by Russia and the Turks.  No wonder people there are so angry and vengeful.  Look up Sarcasian Beauties; the original and most continuously sex slave source for that part of the world.  From Janissaries to Harem&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;ve been battered over and over.  And they are/were some of the most outstanding examples of white perfection ever seen.</p>

		<p><i>I also don&rsquo;t know where Wayne is getting his 80% non-Russian minorities figure. </i></p>
<p>I meant 80% Russian.</p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s a very dangerous third world country.</i></p>
<p>It also has one of the highest murder rates in the world (not just because of minorities), the most dangerous place for journalists to operate (far more so than China), and more corrupt than Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Cambodia.<br/>

		<p>How amazing, that Islamic peoples would desparately emigrate to Moscow.  From the posters most familiar with it, it is far, far, from a Utopia. Most Americans and Western Europeans wouldn&rsquo;t exactly be drawn to the place.  Yet the Islamic groups will desparately break the law, and even work underground secretly at menial work, just to live along side the white man.  Think of how terribly bad must their home countries be, to motivate this.  What kind of a hell hole must they live in to bring millions to Moscow?  They don&rsquo;t necessarily like us, but they so compulsively want to live with us.  With modern travel, that attraction is a fatal curse.  What to do.</p>
