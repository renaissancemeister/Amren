			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John H. Tucker, Riverfront Times News, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Jason&#8221; considers himself a typical fourteen-year-old. &#8220;I got a good family background,&#8221; he asserts by phone from his mother&rsquo;s house in St. Louis County, on a morning when he decided to skip school after oversleeping.</p>
<p>Jason, who asked RFT to use a pseudonym, recently moved to the county from south city, where he attended Fanning Middle School, near Grand Boulevard and not far from the Nguyen household. It was during his middle-school years that he was introduced to Knockout King.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always hit &#8216;em hard,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t hit &#8216;em hard, they don&rsquo;t go far.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason is talking about a ritual  &mdash;  those who participate call it a game  &mdash;  that has been adopted by young teens across the St. Louis area. Once an elusive phenomenon that flew under the local radar, the game exploded onto the collective consciousness with the media reports that followed the attack on Hoang Nguyen.</p>
<p>Along with a generalized sense of fear, there was befuddlement: What would drive a young person to sucker punch a defenseless stranger purely for sport?</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just a little game,&#8221; says Jason. &#8220;We used to walk to where a lot of people be at and hit &#8216;em. If one of the homeboys didn&rsquo;t knock him out, then the other would come. Whoever knock him out would be king.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rules of Knockout King are straightforward, according to Jason and other former players interviewed for this article. A lead attacker is chosen from among a group of boys, usually young adolescents. Next a target is picked out. Then the attacker either charges the unsuspecting victim or motions for his attention. When the target turns or lifts his head, the attacker strikes. If the victim is felled by the punch, the group usually scatters. But if the target withstands the blow, other members of the group may follow up with their fists to finish the job. &#8220;Some people kick, but I ain&rsquo;t used to kick,&#8221; says Jason. &#8220;I just punched.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;d say maybe ten to fifteen percent of kids play Knockout King,&#8221; says Aaron Davis, who&rsquo;s eighteen and lives in south city, adding that he never took part. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a whole school, but it&rsquo;s a nice percentage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some former participants maintain Davis&rsquo; estimate is too low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody plays,&#8221; says eighteen-year-old Brandon Demond, a former participant who provided only his first and middle names for publication.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a game for groups of teens to see who can hit a person the hardest,&#8221; explains Brandon, who&rsquo;s standing with a group of friends on Grand Boulevard as a police officer listens nearby. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a bunch of stupid-ass little dudes in a group, like we are now. See this dude walkin&rsquo; up behind me?&#8221;  &mdash;  Brandon gestures to a longhaired man walking toward him on the sidewalk  &mdash;  &#8220;we could just knock him out right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kids list various motivations for taking part: glory, boredom, peer pressure and showing off one&rsquo;s toughness. For most the game eventually loses its luster. &#8220;It got old on me,&#8221; fourteen-year-old Jason says. &#8220;I&rsquo;d been playing for a long time  &mdash;  I can&rsquo;t even count.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All but two of the ten victims RFT interviewed were white (one was black and was Latino), and all of the players were black. But Knockout King does not appear to be bounded by race. Jason, from St. Louis County, says two white friends were part of his punch-out crew. {snip}</p>
<p>Rather than sweep the race issue under the rug, Saint Louis University criminologistNorman White says Knockout King should be viewed with a broader lens that captures the social disparities of the city. The issue, he says, is less about acts of physical violence than it is about the dearth of opportunities for disadvantaged  &mdash;  and mostly black  &mdash;  youth. He calls that population &#8220;our blind side.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A blatant attempt to trick the victims into thinking the mindset of the criminal who attacked them is other than what it is.</p>
<p>The truth.  The truth is, from a very young age, blacks are taught to hate whites and to fantasize and obsess over killing, robbing and raping us.  At the same time, they rightly fear us.  They fear us because the most common cause of death, for a young black, has always been, and continues to be a white man killing them in self defense.  &#8220;Jason&#8221; always hits em hard because he knows, if his victim gets up, no matter where he lives in the US, there is a chance (and in many places that chance is 100%) the next thing that will happen is a handgun will be drawn and &#8220;Jason&#8221; will become a statistic.</p>
<p>What &#8220;Jason&#8221; wants is a risk free method to kill a white person.  Sometimes he&rsquo;ll attack asians simply based on the perception that they are safer.</p>
<p>And the behavior has gone way up since Obama became president because blacks fantasize about all sorts of changes that has resulted in&hellip;.from Obama&rsquo;s going to pay my rent (remember that one) to whites are no longer armed in Obama&rsquo;s America.  Or more simply, I won&rsquo;t go to jail for it.  None of these things, is, of course, true&hellip;.but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.  It only matters that they think it&rsquo;s true and are acting on it.</p>
<p>There has been race war in the US&hellip;.well, since the first slave was kicked off the boat onto our lands.  We just go through various levels of denial and hypocrisy about the issue.  Heck, there&rsquo;s never been much in the way of &#8220;crime&#8221; in the US (unlike europe) except race war that we cover up by calling it crime.</p>
<p>The behavior of blacks recently, is starting to dispel both the denial and the hypocrisy.  And whites arm themselves more and more.  It won&rsquo;t be long until this breaks out into OPEN warfare&hellip;.followed by zero tolerance for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>So blacks attack whites and it not racial. But it is white people&rsquo;s fault.</p>

<p>We might benefit from looking at this in another light: what is it that White and Asian boys worldwide are doing that prevents them from having to go to such extremes to entertain themselves? Camping? Listening to heavy metal music?</p>

		<p>Actually, the same opportunity of a college degree is available to all, no matter how poor, if only the people would value education.  But blacks and education don&rsquo;t mix, and so you end up with roving gangs of punks beating up defenseless victims (mostly white).</p>
<p>Maybe the punks would take notice if the media said they were &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; their victims, as opposed to merely assaulting them.<br>

<p>We have no reason to suspect he&rsquo;s lying. And if he&rsquo;s not, two Whites, that&rsquo;s practically a majority. I&rsquo;m sure their deference to their black leaders indicates &#8220;racism&#8221; was not involved. But black slaveowners in no way makes slavery unbounded by race. See how it works, you White devil?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The issue, he says, is less about acts of physical violence than it is about the dearth of opportunities for disadvantaged &mdash; and mostly black &mdash; youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, when something hurts blacks, it&rsquo;s race front-and-center. Blacks are not in any way the only ones suffering under Obamanomics. But it&rsquo;s mostly about them, because they are hurting. Understand?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that their victims are 80% white. And don&rsquo;t even ask us to analyze the racial makeup of the town they terrorize. Also don&rsquo;t ask about how we&rsquo;d report this if the races were reversed. The first thing is to give the blacks more &#8220;opportunities&#8221;, by which we mean &#8220;more money from Whites&#8221;. Now go out and vote Democrat.</p>

		<p>Well, I certainly have to admit that Norman White&rsquo;s theory is original. Imagine that - the violent criminal behavior of black youth is due to lack of opportunity!  Why hasn&rsquo;t anybody thought of that before?</p>
<p>This contention certainly warrants further investigation.  I hope Mr. White receives a generous research grant with which to expand on his theory.</p>

		<p> It  seemed to lose its luster? Just a game? When they run into a Texan with a CCL it will really lose its luster for them. The fact that most of the victims were white means nothing. Yeah right.<br>

		<p>I serously doubt that white kids were part of this group.<br>
Criminologist Norman White&rsquo;s take on this outrage is that these thugs only do this because of &#8220;social disparities&#8221; and a &#8220;dearth of opportunities&#8221; for these &#8220;disadvantaged-and mostly black-youth.&#8221;   Wow, it&rsquo;s just a guess but I would bet that Criminologist Norman White is black.<br>

<p>St. Louis City and St. Louis County combined are around 70% non-black (65% white, 5% Asian, Hispanic et al) and 30% black.  The odds that a group of perpetrators are close to 100% black with a group of victims that are, according to that sample, 90% non-black, in such a geographical area, would be entirely a matter of random choice, are way too low.  Cluster, not coincidence.</p>
<p><i>Rather than sweep the race issue under the rug, Saint Louis University criminologist Norman White says Knockout King should be viewed with a broader lens that captures the social disparities of the city. The issue, he says, is less about acts of physical violence than it is about the dearth of opportunities for disadvantaged &mdash; and mostly black &mdash; youth. He calls that population &ldquo;our blind side.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Except the city has a special recreation center sales tax, and has for about five years.  On top of that, both St. Louis City and St. Louis County, plus various incorporated municipalities in the black section of St. Louis county, fall all over themselves in other ways to try and give &#8220;disadvantaged black youths&#8221; something to do.  As a former juvenile probation officer told us a few weeks ago and again a few weeks before that, it are these very &#8220;recreational opportunities&#8221; that generate these sorts of crimes.</p>
<p>Remember in the Nyugen murder, the black perpetrator they have been able to arrest was from the north side of the city, while this &#8220;knockout king&#8221; took place on the south side.  According to local media reports in the meantime, the other three suspects they&rsquo;re looking for are all said to be north side residents probably hiding out on the north side.  This means that four blacks from the other side of the city deliberately came to another part of the city to play this &#8220;knockout king&#8221; game, instead of partaking of recreational opportunities on the north side, fancy that.  At around 10:45 AM on a Saturday morning in that neighborhood, there were probably a number of black people whose paths they crossed, so if this wasn&rsquo;t about race, they could have killed one of them.  But no, I bet they waited for the first non-black person or people they could find, and the Nyugens just happened to be it.</p>

		<p>President Johnson&rsquo;s major achievement in office was signing his Great Society program into law. It only cost a few trillion but it did get results. The Knockout King game is probably one of them.<br>
In the fifties, although blacks were still struggling for equal oppertunities and were on the low end of the economic ladder, the black family was for the most part strong and stable. Two parent families were the rule, not the exception. They attended church together, had strong moral values, and did not comprise a majority of the prison population. Compare that to the present state of the black community after 40 years of Liberal Socialism. Our prisons are disproportionably black, unwed mothers and single parent families are the rule, black youths without a strong male role model other than rap stars and basketball players, roam the streets and are drawn into a culture of drugs and crime.</p>

<p>Read this about their outdoor &#8220;activities&#8221; </p>

<p>I got livid and seeing there were witnesses at that park, why did they not step in and save these kittens? Her and her 8 year old and 5 year old did this! I wish to God I had of been at that park when this was going on! I would be in jail right now. How many millions more cases of this happens that we will never know about? I feel sorrier for our poor animals in this nation as it fills up with these 3rd worlders! At least Whites (if they had the guts) could save themselves and their race, these poor animals cannot. It is getting to the point that </p>
<p>I give up on the brain dead, cowardly Whites (they have choices!) and I have ten times more compassion for these helpless animals that we allow into the hands of these nonwhites. <br>

		<p>This is not a game - I don&rsquo;t care what the thugs call it. It is a ferocious physical assault. These brats think calling it &#8220;Knockout King&#8221; will exempt them from criminal penalties. It shouldn&rsquo;t. Regardless of their age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a surprise that most of the perpetrators are black and almost all the victims are white. Just more proof of racially motivated hate crime against whites that the MSM will try and hide and the authorities will try and paint over. Like quoting this lame &#8220;criminologist&#8221; Norman White saying this is less about physical violence than disadvantaged black youth. And how many times have we heard this pathetic excuse? Just ask the surviving victims if they think these &#8220;youths&#8221; should be given a pass due to their supposed &#8220;disadvantages&#8221;.</p>
<p>The joke is on them. White society can see through their petty excuses and are becoming exceedingly disgusted with the pandering shown to these thugs - that is exactly what they are - thugs, not &#8220;youths&#8221;. Anyone of any race committing crimes like this should be dealt with as harshly as the law will allow. And if the victims are armed and manage to dodge these punks they should not be charged with using deadly force to protect themselves. Knockout King=Attempted Murder.</p>
<p>And as for &#8220;Jason&#8221; saying &#8220;he&rsquo;s got a good family background&#8221;, oh no, you do not. Your actions have disqualified your family from ever being considered good - they produced you, didn&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>The criminologist in this article says that &#8220;knockout king&#8221; is about social disadvantage. My question for him would then become: If it is about social disadvantage, why is the goal merely to &#8220;knockout&#8221; the victim. The perpetrators speak frankly in this article. They do it for fun, to combat boredom. It doesn&rsquo;t even seem that they bothered to strip the victims of their wallets, but rather scattered to the four winds once the knockout was accomplished.</p>
<p>Also, even after you contexualize a crime by saying the perpetrators were disadvantaged, the crime remains a crime. It still has to be prosecuted. There are recreation centers, midnight basketball leagues, even parts of a city designated where youths are allowed to spray graffiti to express themselves. With all of these options and more, these &#8220;youths&#8221; still chose to play &#8220;Knockout King.&#8221;</p>

<p>These two &#8220;White friends&#8221; may have White skin, but if they&rsquo;re hanging out with black thugs, they haven&rsquo;t been &#8216;White&rsquo; in a long time, if ever! I wonder if this black thug would stand back and let his White friends beat down a black man? No - don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll happen.<br>
This reminds me of the time they said that those black thugs that slaughtered the young White couple in Knoxville couldn&rsquo;t be racist because &#8220;they dated White girls&#8221;!   </p>

Liberals raise a legitimate concern about the high cost of incarceration. This can be reduced by the thorough exploitation of prison labor, the frequent use of capital and corporeal punishment, and an end to educational, recreational, and psychological facilities. Criminals have debts to pay society. Most cannot be rehabilitated. The only way to get any value out of them is through prison labor. <br>

		<p>One thing that strikes me is the neutral, totally nonjudgmental tone of this news item. Appalling. </p>
<p>Contrast this with the tone of a MSM piece covering anything that&rsquo;s called a hate crime.&#8221; There would be extensive quotes from victims, much cluck-clucking by academics, delving into the &#8220;hateful&#8221; motivation of the perpetrators, etc. etc. How about this gem:<i>Kids list various motivations for taking part: glory, boredom, peer pressure and showing off one&rsquo;s toughness.</i> Not so much as a mention of &#8220;hatred&#8221; &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;resentment,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p><i>All but two of the ten victims RFT interviewed were white (one was black and was Latino), and all of the players were black. But Knockout King does not appear to be bounded by race.</i> </p>
<p>No, of course not! And to what does the author attribute this conclusion? <i> Jason, from St. Louis County, says two white friends were part of his punch-out crew.  </i> Oh, well that certainly proves it to me!</p>
<p><i>Rather than sweep the race issue under the rug, Saint Louis University criminologistNorman White says Knockout King should be viewed with a broader lens that captures the social disparities of the city.</i> He said, sweeping race under the rug  &mdash;  and using coded language to blame it on &#8220;white society&#8221; and racism.</p>
<p>All of the MSM and academia are corrupt, but it&rsquo;s really a brilliant con game they&rsquo;ve got going here. When blacks act in an obviously racist fashion, it&rsquo;s really just proof of white racism. Of course this con wouldn&rsquo;t work so well if the white sheeple weren&rsquo;t so willing to go along with it.</p>

<p>When the &#8220;knockout kings&#8221; are sent to jail for a good long time, maybe twenty or thirty years, they will not be out and about with their welfare girlfriends making more future &#8220;knockout kings&#8221;. Appropriately long jail terms serves a number of purposes, first it keeps the viscious criminal off the streets and it takes up many of their reproductive years.  If White people in this country stopped voting for liberal democrats, there would be fewer liberal judges on the bench which would mean that criminals would get real sentences for their crimes and the numbers of their offspring would go down.  Consequently the crime and the welfare bill would go do.  Criminals behind bars cannot make babies.</p>

<p>Good point, AWG.</p>
<p>Notice how if it&rsquo;s a black person committing the crime, everyone should just forgive them? A lot of black victims give voice to this same mentality. Even if they murder someone&rsquo;s child. Unbelievable. I don&rsquo;t know if this comes from their childish, low IQ mentalities or because most are sociopaths with a carefully taught hatred for white people and a very low opinion of human life. Probably both. And notice how Ann tries to downplay what her son did by using the word killing instead of murder. </p>
<p>Your son&rsquo;s a monster, Ann. I don&rsquo;t care what he did in church or what that pandering, idiot of a judge had to say. He murdered a man and only showed remorse when ordered to. And any forgiveness on Christopher Fannan&rsquo;s (the murdered white teenager) mother&rsquo;s part is none of your business - your murdering remorseless son only got 10 and a half years. He SHOULD have received the death penalty.</p>
<p>Stories like this show our judicial system sinks to new lows everyday. They need to hand out fair sentences and bring back public hangings, and televise them.</p>

		<p>Sureesh is right.  In over twenty years in the criminal justice system I have never seen an Indian, whether Hindu, Sikh or Christian involved in a violent crime.  In fact, I only remember one case where the defendant was from India.  It was a shoplifting case.  She seemed really ashamed, pled guilty right away, and that was that.  Sometimes Indians seem a little aloof, but I think that is just due to being in a different culture.  Second generation Indians tend towards preppiness, academics, and obeying the law.  If these crimes are due to deprivation, why are they not committed by first-generation Indians, who often have very little?</p>
<p>In our small southern community Indians have been fine citizens.  No one fears seeing three Indians on a street at night. Of course if you see three or four it is usually Dad, Mom and the kids.   Can&rsquo;t say the same for some other groups.</p>

<p>Those of us on Amren do not blame poverty. The ghetto blacks have more than I do and the reason they do what they do is because they are BLACK, period. As for  We Whites worked for pennies a day also in the fields (we did not accept &#8220;welfare&#8221; back then) when I was growing up and we did not commit crimes. As for India, you don&rsquo;t have to put up with people of all races, you don&rsquo;t have PC, you don&rsquo;t have to &#8220;accommodate/tolerate&#8221; 3rd world &#8220;immigrants&#8221; into your land. </p>
<p>A nation that has it&rsquo;s own kindred SHOULD have little crime as we did back in the days before the &#8220;rulers that be&#8221; took over completely. During segregation we did not have to worry about blacks and their crimes, we did not live among them, go to school with them, bow down to their every whim. They FEARED the White population back then, now we have to fear them.</p>
<p>Now we are taught to hate the K, rednecks, &#8220;racists&#8221;, etc. because they kept the blacks at bay and away from our people. We did not have 3rd world immigration, &#8220;civil&#8221; rights, anti-White laws (AA and hate crimes) and on and on. You can get a glimpse of America back then, watching old movies, older sitcoms, or just asking some elderly White person what life was like back then.</p>

		<p>Can you imagine what would have happened if Barack Obama had lost the election in 2008. The next day, White Males across America would have been violently assaulted by black youth. We are very close to a race war in America&hellip;one match into the gasoline filled basement away. Blacks will start the race war eventually. The good thing about the inevitable race war  &mdash;  and inevitable it is-is that it force millions of White Americans to deal for the first time with the reality of the massive treason of both the Republican and Democratic parties with regard to post-1965 immigration and its massive race-replacement consequences.</p>

Sureesh is right. In over twenty years in the criminal justice system I have never seen an Indian, whether Hindu, Sikh or Christian involved in a violent crime. In fact, I only remember one case where the defendant was from India. It was a shoplifting case. She seemed really ashamed, pled guilty right away, and that was that.<br>

This is not only culture; it is innate. Civilization breeds a population for law obedience because the criminal justice system of a civilized nation will gradually remove those with criminal inclinations from the gene pool. The Indians have practiced urban civilization for four thousand years and agriculture for many thousands of years longer than that. <br>
 <br>
Although India has a much lower per capita gross domestic product than the United States, it also has a lower murder rate.<br>

<p>Nonsense.  Things like this happen everywhere in America where there are blacks.  There are regularly articles posted on this site about black mob attacks in the South.  Recently, there were attacks in Georgia and South Carolina.  </p>
<p>There seems to a strain of delusional thinking among many racially conscious Southerners whereby they are blind anti-white attacks in their own backyard while they gloat about similar incidents in other parts of the country.  </p>

<p>What a joke. Barack uses the small amount of black blood he has (he&rsquo;s 44% arab and 50% white, descended from slave traders) to get elected and to get blacks off scot-free from crime. He and Holder are making sure that blacks KNOW they will not be held responsible no matter how bad they get.</p>

<p>Sureesh is exactly right. By third world standards, American ghetto blacks  are filthy rich.  It is not poverty but PERMISSIVENESS that is at the root of black  anti-social behaviour. In other words, they do it BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN and they will be able to get away with it.  </p>

<p>Teens Sentenced For SEPTA Beating</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA (AP) ― Three teens convicted of fatally beating a Starbucks manager on a Philadelphia subway platform are going to prison for more than 12 years.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say 18-year-old Ameer Best and 17-year-olds Nashir Fisher and Kinta Stanton took part in the assault on a dare after cutting school in March 2008.</p>
<p>The victim, 36-year-old Sean Conroy, suffered a fatal asthma attack amid the series of blows. He found himself cornered and alone on the subway platform near City Hall.</p>
<p>Sharon Conroy faced the teens in court and said she lost her only child, her heart and soul.</p>
<p>Best and Fisher were convicted at trial of third-degree murder and conspiracy. Stanton was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit murder. <br>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound too good either. Especially since India has a nation with their own racial kin for the most part. America no longer does, sad to say. When America was mostly White, we did not have nearly the numbers or the savageness of crimes of what we have today thanks to &#8220;multiculturalism, immigration, desegregation, and PC garbage&#8221;. I grew up in a small town next to a bigger city and very rarely did we ever hear of crime. Felonies were almost nonexistent.</p>

<p>Blacks used to experience those kind of social situations.  Jared Taylor can produce evidence that in 1950 (?), black women were slightly more likely than white women to be married.  Black men used to be somewhat responsible and given to employment (though not universally).  To the extent that their limited IQ allowed them to partake of education, blacks did want and care about education.  In 1900, the state of Mississippi had the highest percentage of blacks of all states in the union, yet one of the lowest crime rates.  A hundred years later, Mississippi still had the highest percentage of blacks, but one of the highest crime rates.</p>
<p>What is the difference?  The segregationist system implored blacks to adhere to white standards as best they could, while ironically creating outlets for them to &#8220;let it all hang out&#8221; among their own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not.  Big whoop, Indians can spell.  Look at what good it&rsquo;s doing India.  Am I supposed to be impressed that a few Indian kids can spell obscure words that most people will never hear much less use in their lives?  Most people use a spell checker, and if the occasional misspelling gets by that, then it really doesn&rsquo;t matter because most people don&rsquo;t care about a spelling error or two in a document.  There are far many more and better things about which to be concerned than whether &#8220;conceptualization,&#8221; &#8220;onomatopoeia,&#8221; &#8220;transsubstantiation,&#8221; or &#8220;phlegm&#8221; are spelled properly in a blog post comment.  Frankly, and this might sound pot-kettle-black coming from me, but I really dislike the kind of people that get major league hangups over spelling errors, because I really dislike obnoxious know-it-alls.  The kind of person who obsesses over spelling errors is the kind of person who can do so, and is therefore the kind of person who lives such a charmed, pampered, spoiled life that he probably won&rsquo;t ever have to experience &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  Meanwhile, the kind of people who are turned off by such prissy attitudes are the kind of people who read AmRen because they&rsquo;re up to their necks in diversity.  I am so Machiavellian that if I were advising a political candidate, in a race where my &#8220;horse&#8221; was behind or running neck-and-neck, I would advise him or her to plant the occasional non-ostentatious spelling error in official campaign publications, websites, press releases, flyers, literature, and so on.  The hope on my part is that the other side makes fun of the spelling errors, and that &#8220;know-it-all-ism&#8221; so reviles the white working class voters that they swing to our side and that puts us over the top.  Think I&rsquo;m kidding?  I think snooty leftist Democrats making fun of George W. Bush&rsquo;s malapropistic tendencies in 2000 turned just enough people against them and Gore and that&rsquo;s the hair lash that put Bush over the top.</p>

<p>Posting wikipedia links of what crime is in India doesn&rsquo;t prove your point. Statistics are needed with population levels taking into account. India has to be somewhat better just reading about Africa all the time. But even so there are many places that have high poverty where crime isn&rsquo;t that high. It is certainly possible for different racial groups are prone to different levels and types of crime. Indians aren&rsquo;t an exception to that rule.</p>
<p>But the overall point which I think you missed it the other guy being tired (the same for me) as poverty being used as an excuse (regardless of the truth to it).</p>

		<p>What the article did not make clear was that they killed Mr. Nguyen.  So you can call it a game or you can call it fun stuff but the bottom line is that man is DEAD.  The white man does have some responsibility in ALL of this though and that was the creation of the welfare nanny state pushed through by liberals in the 60&rsquo;s.  THAT was true racism at its finest.  It created a system that destroyed the black family and made entire generations dependent on government hand outs.  The ironic part is that if asked blacks would tell you what a wonderful thing welfare is.  Sort of like telling someone to go to hell and making them look forward to the trip.<br>
