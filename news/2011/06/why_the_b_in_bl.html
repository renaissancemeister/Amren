<h1>Why the &#8216;B&rsquo; in &#8216;Black&rsquo; Is Capitalized at DiversityInc</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Visconti, DiversityInc, June 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><strong>Question:</p>
<p>Could you explain why the &#8220;b&#8221; in &#8220;black Americans&#8221; is not capitalized? I&rsquo;ve noticed that other ethnic groups all are capitalized. But not Black people. Why is this?</p>
<p>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Most mainstream print publications in the United States use what is known as &#8220;AP style,&#8221; or the style dictated by The Associated Press Stylebook. This book and web site describes what to capitalize and what not to capitalize (among other rules of grammar).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I made the decision not to follow AP style in the case of &#8220;Black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; when it applies to describing people. AP style is to capitalize neither; however, terms such as African American, Negro, Caucasian, Italian American or Asian are all capitalized.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there is adequate representation among the decision makers at the AP, I felt DiversityInc needed to be more accurate.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;Black&#8221; is used around the world to describe people who have &#8220;racial&#8221; features indicating African ancestry. Please keep in mind that the convention of race has been discarded by science  &mdash;  genetically, we are all one race, and the human-genome project proves we are all from Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I do not believe &#8220;white&#8221; needs to be capitalized because people in the white majority don&rsquo;t think of themselves in that way. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with this  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just how it is. The exception is white supremacists who have a definite vision for what &#8220;white&#8221; means. Most American white people describe themselves in more defined terms, such as Irish American or Jewish. {snip}</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will ever be a time in our country where &#8220;white&#8221; becomes &#8220;White.&#8221; Nor do I think white people will accept the term &#8220;minority&#8221; when we become less than 50 percent of our population by roughly 2045. {snip}<br/>

<p>Incredible that so much stupidity can be jammed into one sentence! This babble comes complete with lies, inaccuracies, exaggerations, and omissions - what a bargain!</p>
<p>&#8220;The convention of race&#8221;? <br/>
Sorry, never a &#8220;convention&#8221;. Some relatively &#8216;recent&rsquo; theorists posit otherwise, but there is also a vast scientific community that disagrees. </p>
<p>&#8220;Discarded by Science&#8221; - Wow. What a sweeping statement. Where is your proof? Have you been appointed to speak on the behalf of &#8220;science&#8221;? </p>
<p>Statements like this are extremely dirty. He is trying to add weight to his preposterous and dangerous ideology by exploiting a majestic word like &#8216;science&rsquo;, and the imagery and insinuations that go with it. </p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;Genetically we are all one race&#8221;<br/>
More drivel. Genetics does not prove race&hellip;species, MAYBE, and at best.<br/>
Second, as mentioned time and again, race exists on a Biological level, not a genetic one!</p>
<p>&#8220;The human-genome project proves we are all from Africa&#8221;.</p>
<p>And another project has proven otherwise. So what?<br/>
The biggest flaw in the &#8216;out-of-Africa&rsquo; theory is that it is tentative at best. It is based on the ASSUMPTION that every single Homo E. has been uncovered, worldwide.<br/>

		<p>Why does &#8220;Diversityinc&#8221; think it is appropriate for whites to view themsselves as &#8220;Irish&#8221; &#8220;Jewish&#8221; etc. but not as white? It&rsquo;s as simple as the old saying: &#8220;Divide and Conquer.&#8221; Blacks are roughly 13% of the population. Whites are closer to 65%. If we are allowed to think in monolithic terms of &#8220;BLACK&#8221; but must sub-categorize all &#8220;whites,&#8221; then we have managed to undermine a majority while shorning up a minority to leverage power over the many by the hand of a few. This is why political correctness is sometimes called &#8220;Minority Rule&#8221; and it is why &#8220;Diversityinc&#8221; is in favor of political correctness, down to its ridiculous assertion that the &#8220;Out of Africa&#8221; theory is not in fact a theory, but is rather to be taken as gospel.</p>

<p>What a surprise. Someone from a leftist rag refusing to capitalize the word &#8220;White&#8221; and at the same time capitalizing the word &#8220;black&#8221;. </p>
<p>I post on more than a few web sites. I always capitalize the &#8220;W&#8221; when using the word &#8220;White&#8221; in describing Whites. And I never capitalize the &#8220;b&#8221; when describing blacks. I have no respect for the black race and simply refuse to capitalize the b in black. The same when using the names of black leaders, like jesse, al, shabazz, quanell or even common black folks like shenequa or quantrell.</p>

		<p> Ask The (Self-Hating) White Guy can upper- or lower-case whatever he wants. I&rsquo;ve always capitalized White when I mean the White race, or Caucasians, or European-descended peoples, for years, and I&rsquo;ll continue to do that. I don&rsquo;t capitalize &#8220;black&#8221; because I just like to be contrary, and anti-P.C.</p>
<p> And by the way, Mr. White Guy, you&rsquo;re wrong, wrong, wrong about there being &#8220;one race.&#8221; Just because scientists say it&rsquo;s so, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it is. And I don&rsquo;t believe and never will that it&rsquo;s graven in stone that &#8220;we are all from Africa.&#8221; I, for one, have gotten way beyond accepting the assurances of &#8220;experts&#8221; about a lot of things   &mdash;   including this one.</p>

<p>He means he HOPES these things! Also, note that he is quick to cite the human-genome project when it &#8220;proves&#8221; we are &#8220;all from Africa,&#8221; but not for some of the findings that don&rsquo;t fit so nicely into his worldview.</p>
<p>Finally, the absurdity of dissecting how all the racial groups should be referred to while at the same time claiming that there are no such things as different racial groups is indicative of the most Orwellian doublethink.</p>

		<p>No need to capitalize white. Just look around, the legacy of white creativity and society building is the standard of the modern world. To be white is to be capitalized. The others need the ego stroking. </p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the convention of race has been lied about by politically correct fools who claim to have standing in the scientific community, but in reality are no more than fools who tell lies in order to keep funding coming in for their pet projects.</p>
<p>There is almost as much difference between humans of different races as there is between chimpanzees and humans.</p>
<p>This &#8220;every-body-is-the-same&#8221; is a flat earth lie that will eventually be condemned as it should be.</p>
<p>Like every sect that brainwashes it&rsquo;s adherents the cult of political correctness is as kooky as the theory that the earth is not round.</p>

		<p>This message is so full of errors, it&rsquo;s like a Buffet of Mistakes (TM). I read a comment on the Apollo lunar photographs by a Flat-Earther and the style is exactly like this guy.</p>
<p>Undercutting the guy&rsquo;s entire argument is that making assumptions about races is wrong, but then he/she/it makes at least two broad, sweeping generalizations about Whites. There is no Left without hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Science has not discarded the idea of race, it&rsquo;s simply off-limits, at least in the USA. Sounds like the author doesn&rsquo;t know anything about genetics.</p>
<p>Whether the Out-of-Africa hypothesis is true or false means nothing at all. There are two reasons for this.</p>
<p>1. There are human populations in Africa that aren&rsquo;t black.<br/>
2. In the greater context of evolution, stopping at Africa 50,000 years ago does not give any authority to the position of DiversityInc. Why not use our common ancestry with fish to argue that fishing is racist? After all, if race has no meaning scientifically, can&rsquo;t I use it in a popular way to describe animosity towards others in the tree of life?</p>

		<p>Balderdash!  The British at least used to refer to many non-European ethnicities as black.  Thus, even Arabs were called black.  And white Australians, at least in the past, sometimes referred to Australoids as blackfellows.<br/>
This article appears to take the oft-heard position that whites don&rsquo;t have racial identity.  That may be the way some non-whites and loony white liberals want it, but that&rsquo;s never been the case.  <br/>
The words &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;white&#8221; are not proper nouns and thus are not to be capitalized in strictly proper English.</p>

		<p>Luke Visconti at DiversityInc has a long record of anti-white hate speech.  He falls into the WINO category (white in name only).  We&rsquo;ve studied the naming issue for about 20 years ourselves, and it appears that both the dominant media culture and the corporate entertainment culture seek to disrespect the diverse white American peoples in many ways.</p>
<p>One is by referring to us as &#8220;whites.&#8221;  Other groups are given names that suggest internal diversity and declare American citizenship.  Just look at African Americans and Asian Americans.  We are entirely confident that the label &#8220;whites&#8221; is deliberately to condense us into a tiny category without nationality and without diversity.  But &#8220;white&#8221; is an adjective, and never capitalized. </p>
<p>Visconti, who probably doesn&rsquo;t know any normal white people, predicts that the diverse white American peoples will not accept the term &#8220;minority,&#8221; but we are already doing so in Northern California where we have a group called &#8220;Minority White Community&#8221; which posts everywhere in San Jose and Santa Clara.  After all, we are now a mere 28% of San Jose&rsquo;s population   &mdash;  - that&rsquo;s a minority.</p>
<p>Why any self-respecting white American would ever consult Visconti is the question.  He ranks with the $LPC and Tim Wise as a leader in white-bashing.</p>

		<p>You are not speaking for me and most White people I know, Luke Visconti. My great grandparents were immigrants from Poland and the UK. I consider myself White, not Euro-American. Bluster all you want, white and black should either be both, or neither, capitalized, even if you don&rsquo;t like white people.</p>

<p>This is not true.  I grew up in a 100% white small town in an area where the nearest blacks were quite a drive away (in an urban ghetto area).</p>
<p>Not one single person, when I was growing up, described themselves as anything but &#8220;Americans&#8221; or &#8220;Whites&#8221;.  This author must live in some big urban area with a lot of ethnic whites who are newly arrived by only a generation or two or three and who retained the old country habits and values.</p>

<p>In the thousands of White people I&rsquo;ve come across in my journey through life, only afew have let it slip that they were Jewish, but NONE have ever referred to themselves as Irish American, German American, Dutch American etc., just &#8220;American&#8221;!<br/>

		<p>To say that we all came &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; to a White person, is the same as going up to Leonardo da Vinci or Brahms and saying, &#8220;You used to wear diapers and crawl around defecating and urinating on yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the political left certainly don&rsquo;t describe Whites that way. They never see Irish or Scandinavians when checking for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; - they only see White people versus everyone else.</p>
<p>***<br/>
If we&rsquo;re all Africans then presumably everyone in America can call themselves African American. Every president before Obama was also African American, and so there is no need for affirmative action or ethnic &#8216;quotas&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The diversityInc. responder is soooooo incorrect on so many levels. What would one expect? </p>

		<p>&#8220;And by the way, Mr. White Guy, you&rsquo;re wrong, wrong, wrong about there being &#8216;one race.&rsquo; Just because scientists say it&rsquo;s so, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which scientists are you talking about? James Watson, a Nobel prize-winning scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, said this about blacks: &#8220;All our social policies are based on the fact that [black Africans&rsquo;] intelligence is the same as ours. Whereas all the testing says not really.&#8221;</p>

		<p><b>Please keep in mind that the convention of race has been discarded by science &mdash; genetically, we are all one race, and the human-genome project proves we are all from Africa.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Then why do you have an organization called DiversityInc?  I mean, how can you say there is racial diversity and get say we are all one race?  Why do you say &#8216;racism&rsquo; and use racial categories like &#8216;white&rsquo; and &#8216;black&rsquo; and so forth if race is just a social construct?  And who are the scientists that told you this?  Where does their funding come from?  If race is &#8216;just a construct&rsquo; why do medical professionals ask for it?  Busted!</p>

		<p>Medical Science is divided 50/50 between those that want to associate disease and congenital problems &#8216;by Continent&rsquo; instead of race.  And those that live in the 21st century and understand that where geography of association can change, the genetics of race is a more permanent and accurate a label.</p>
<p>Given that White and Asian genetics are a function of the L3 (M&N;) offshoot migration to Saudi and India while Blacks remain associated with the parent genes of L1/L2 as the more primitive precursor which stayed behind; &#8216;Out Of Africa&rsquo; is probably more divisive than conjoining of our -diverse- fates.</p>
<p>Of course, Darwinists have always known that true diversity arises in terrain **isolates** where small, optimized, _descendant_ populations prove more survivable than the progenitor species.</p>
<p>Crack a book every once in a while Mr. Visconti, may I recommend:</p>
<p>_Before The Dawn_ by Nicholas Wade?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is Jew always capitalized but not gentile? Why is Muslim always capitalized but not christian? &#8220;</p>
<p>I have not noticed this ever. Even auto correct on your word program will underline in red, any proper noun such as Christianity, or Gentile when it is not capitalized.  I see what you are trying to say, but unless you give specific examples, I think you are simply fabricating the argument.</p>
<p>Having lived in Europe for a while, I learned that in many countries, anyone with dark hair and brown eyes, and perhaps some olive in their complexion was considered and called &#8220;black.&#8221;  This is how for example, the term &#8220;black Irish&#8221; came about. It refers to the Irish descendants of some Spanish intermingling that was the outcome of Catholic political links against England, etc.</p>
<p>Before not long ago, Negroes were not even thought of very much.  My spell check made me capitalize &#8220;Negro.&#8221;  As it does for Caucasian. </p>

		<p>What a driveling leftist rag!<br/>
The human genome project&rsquo;s true results were papered over with politically correct &#8220;feel-good&#8221; nonsense. I would like to say that even if the first homo erectus lived in africa that does not mean that it was black.<br/>
 Don&rsquo;t forget the asian scientists, like that 17 year old chinese or japanese boy That don&rsquo;t have to bend to this kind of politics and are telling the truth about genetics &amp; race</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think there will ever be a time in our country where &ldquo;white&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;White.&rdquo; Nor do I think white people will accept the term &ldquo;minority&rdquo; when we become less than 50 percent of our population by roughly 2045.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, this omits the most important part of this assumption&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>IF WE DO NOTHING!</p>
<p>Then, yes&hellip;..white will become a minority in the USA by 2045 or so. But I do not believe my relatives will sit still while their country is invaded by foreigners (any foreigners). They have been fighting for generations. (One popular book about the Scot-Irish was titled BORN FIGHTING.) I see nothing that indicates that the Scot-Irish will draw back from defending hearth and home, once they perceive a threat.</p>

		<p>Geez. According to the rules of grammar, the &#8220;black&#8221; in &#8220;black Americans&#8221; should not be capitalized because it is an adjective, not a proper noun. However, &#8220;Blacks&#8221; and &#8220;Whites&#8221; when used alone (not before &#8220;Americans&#8221;) ARE proper nouns and are therefore capitalized. It has nothing to do with their phoney-baloney PC sociology.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight, your comments about the status of dark-haired, brown-eyed people (such as myself) in Europe, made me sad.</p>
<p>To be thought of &#8220;as less than&#8221; by one&rsquo;s own people is disheartening.</p>
<p>I do not have any Spanish, but I can get as dark as a Mexican in the summer, and used to do so in my youth.</p>
<p>I am a member of Mensa, and consider my mental abilities to be equal to that of any German. I am of another personality type, but my mental processes are equally rational, and perhaps more needed. </p>
<p>I have just returned from Paris, and was encouraged to see so many NON-blonde, NON-blue-eyed, NON-big-bodied, NON-pasty-White people! And I am talking about Europeans, not immigrants from North Africa. </p>
<p>Accept us, dudes.  </p>
