<h1>Volunteers Will Help Keep Peace on Streets for This Year&rsquo;s Black Expo</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Tuohy, Indystar, June 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An army of peacekeepers will complement a police contingent at this year&rsquo;s Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration in an effort to avoid a repeat of violence that marred last year&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>Public Safety Director Frank Straub said 25 community affairs officers, who are trained to work with youths, will be among the nearly 300 uniformed officers and 300 church volunteers working the last two nights of the 41st annual event, which begins July 7.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Deputy Chief Mike Bates said 275 uniformed officers will work the final Friday of Expo, and 290 will work the next night  &mdash;  about the same as last year. In addition, undercover detectives will patrol the streets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three shootings injured 10 people on the last weekend of Expo in 2010. Police said rival youth street gangs that carried a grudge sparked the shootings Downtown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The task force estimated that as many as 6,000 teenagers congregate around the Hyatt Regency Downtown on Expo&rsquo;s final Saturday. The task force encouraged strict curfew enforcement.</p>

<p>Too bad they didn&rsquo;t enlist the NAACP to tell them how to control the criminal blacks.</p>
<p>NAACP mysteriously stays out of the news whenever black crime is the topic.</p>
<p>When will we hold them accountable by using the true or not rhetoric of cause and effect?<br>

		<p><i>An army of peacekeepers will complement a police contingent at this year&rsquo;s Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration in an effort to avoid a repeat of violence that marred last year&rsquo;s event.</i></p>
<p>But when an &#8220;army&#8221; of volunteers voluntarily complement the U.S. Border Patrol in southern Arizona, the media and the left throw a fit.</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;ll be unarmed.  Which means they&rsquo;ll be really effective (note the sarcasm) when face to face with armed black gang thugs.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/IZ5ml" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/IZ5ml</a>   &mdash;   Found that on SBPDL.  Note they will add a NASCAR exhibit to the Indiana Black Expo.  Are they trying to make it less black?  If so, good for them.  Maybe &#8220;black expos&#8221; need a little bit of desegregation.<br>

<p>Sadly, the longer I work in my role the clearer it becomes that years of oppression, slavery, colonialism, Jim Crow laws and genocide affect how people of color deal with each other. Some still believe that &ldquo;white is right.&rdquo; Even people of color within our system operate with this in our subconscious mind. White people designed the system to benefit themselves. They created it, and those of us who have chosen to be a part of it have to deal with the lingering effects of white privilege and dominating power. But I do not believe it is up to white people alone to fix the problem. All of us have a role in helping the church become what God intends it to be.</p>

		<p>Why do we inset upon coddling these people? Marcus Aurelius said &#8220;stand erect or be made to stand erect&#8221;. Isn&rsquo;t it the height of racism not to expect them to act like civilized human beings? But alas we all know what is going to happen at this little get together, the question is why do we allow this animalistic behavior to continue? And just keeps getting worse and worse&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The ones I feel sorry for are the employees at the Hyatt Regency Downtown.  I worked in a hotel, as a valet/bellman, where blacks would gather once a year for the Texas Relays (high school track and field), and let me tell you it was miserable.  The atmosphere was awful, the black &#8220;customers&#8221; were openly hostile to all Whites they encountered, and every long-term employee would try and take vacation days during this time.  It got to the point where I stopped caring about these &#8220;hotel guests&#8221; and would just stay hidden, thus stifling my chances to make money by performing my normal tasks to regular hotel gusts.  I was dating a waitress at a Cajun restaurant behind the hotel, and she was in tears nearly every night from running around trying to cater to the whim of all the blacks, for little or no tip.  </p>

I used to have a friend who owned a restaurant that he would sometimes rent to groups for parties. He told me that he always had more problems with black groups. They were rude to the staff. They tipped little or nothing. They stole what they could sneak out to their cars. <br>
 <br>
It is unfortunate that the mainstream news media, even FOX News and The Wall Street Journal, prefers to present an unrealistically benign image of a race that causes many problems without contributing anything of obvious value. </p>

<p>Looks like we have an impostor here.  These comments are aimed at further disenfranchising whites by implying that whites have more work to do in giving up further, their culture and society to &#8220;people of color&#8221; who want to replace us.  She uses the sure fire invocation of God and Church in furthering her argument.</p>
<p>The solution,we know, is and always has been to separate ourselves, get away from, and avoid contact with non-whites whenever and however possible.  Mixing ruins us, our culture, and our society.  I can&rsquo;t find one example where people of color have brought anything but expense and misery to whites.  We tried to help them in their own countries, but they insist on ruining their own homes and then demanding to live with us.</p>

		<p>I hope every sane business owner boards up his business wherever this mess takes place.</p>
<p>I have NEVER, EVER read about a large black gathering that did not result in violence. When ever there is one of those Black Beach weeks in Florida, the smart and sane shop owners close up and get OUT of town so they aren&rsquo;t killed.</p>
<p>There is no way they will keep the violence down. By the way, I have read (and heard on the radio) that blacks are offended when they are confronted with a large &#8220;police&#8221; force that is not needed for white gathering. That in itself makes them mad.<br>

<p>The link provided by this saboteur of European heritage, who is black and male, shows that even the Mennonite Church is being invaded and forced into Multiculturalism via their own Christian scriptures.  If I read the linked column correctly, this black man is become somehow a Mennonite preacher.  As the handle he uses on this Amren posting proves, he a a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</p>

		<p>Last March, a white man, James S. Gillette Jr., 19 - WORKING at Belair Conference Center, Columbia County, near Augusta, Georgia, was shot and killed at a party attended exclusively by black teenagers.  It is dangerous for any whites to be around violent blacks for any reason.  They will be singled out for special punishment regardless of the reason for their presence.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Expo Summer Celebration&#8221; is held and it ends in widespread violence and bloodshed. There is, of course, no question that it be held again next year. The host city (meaning its tax base) must pay to flood the streets with police and practically impose martial law just to maintain a modicum of order. This isn&rsquo;t a gangster rap concert or street protest but a black &#8220;expo&#8221; and thousands of police are required to prevent murder and mayhem. Again, no consideration is given to simply shutting the event down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Taylor can&rsquo;t find a venue willing to host a bunch of employed, middle-aged guys who want to calmly discuss current events.</p>
<p>This is our country, aren&rsquo;t you proud of it? </p>

		<p>My only advice to my fellow whites who live there is to avoid the area altogether. If you work at the Hyatt book a week off of vacation. If you can&rsquo;t do that, phone in sick, even if you don&rsquo;t get sick days. Just eat a few days pay. Its worth it to avoid the trouble.</p>

		<p>I live in a coastal town in Southeast Georgia where our small island beach community used to host an all black weekend party for graduates of a local all black college.<br>
After about 7 years of riots, robberies, rapes and gunbattles most of the islands local businesses refused to open to the public while this affair took place and the island residents began to protest months in advance because of all of the property damage as well as thefts at their homes where none of the visiting blacks had any reason to be near as their homes are located on the other side of the highway which divides the island.<br>
Eventually the whole fiasco was done away with because the risk of black on black/black on white crime was too much.<br>
These same black &#8220;Collegiates&#8221; are also well known for riots, fights and shootings at football games held in their stadium everytime they have a game.<br>
Must be a &#8220;black thing&#8221;, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

		<p>&#8220;avoid a repeat of violence that marred last year&rsquo;s event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marred? More like characterized, or typified.</p>

		<p>#18, #23: I would rather clean horse stables than wait on, or serve, blacks in any way. </p>
<p>At least the four legged animal apreciates what you do for it, and is even tempered. I actually enjoy being around horses, and dogs.</p>

		<p>gwh #27: Having independent ethnic European-American Festivals is the only way today to have anything exclusively one White ethnic group, with other Whites invited, of course. </p>
<p>It cannot be dumped on by the NAACP, or the Southern Stooge Lawless Center, because they celebrate a specific European ethnic identity, with food, music, language, culture, and in some case, Religion, such as the Greek Orthodox Church, or Catholic Church, being large participants of the Ethnic Festivals.</p>
<p>The two offending Leftist groups would like to tear down these individual ethnic celebrations, but then, telling a Greek,  Italian, Croat, Pole, or Ukrainian that they can no longer celebrate being who they are will be the final straw. </p>

		<p>Just watch an average daily News Broadcast, especially during the spring and summer months, when these types gather to have &#8220;parties&#8221;. They can&rsquo;t seem to go one weekend, and one party, without a shooting, or multiple stabbing. </p>
<p>So why do we care? I don&rsquo;t care, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t affect me, or anyone I know, or any White person, in general. </p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, let them do it to themselves. </p>
