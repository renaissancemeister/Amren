			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George F. Will, Washington Post, June 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the 1850s, on the steps of the Waco courthouse, Wallace Jefferson&rsquo;s great-great-great-grandfather was sold. Today, Jefferson is chief justice of Texas&rsquo;s Supreme Court. The governor who nominated him also nominated the state&rsquo;s first Latina justice. Rick Perry, 61, the longest-serving governor in Texas history and, in his 11th year, currently the nation&rsquo;s senior governor, says these nominations are two of his proudest accomplishments.</p>
<p>French cuffs and cowboy boots are, like sauerkraut ice cream, an eclectic combination, but Perry, who wears both, is a potentially potent candidate for the Republican presidential nomination because his political creed is uneclectic, matching that of the Republican nominating electorate. He was a &#8220;10th Amendment conservative&#8221; (&#8220;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people&#8221;) before the Tea Party appeared. And before Barack Obama&rsquo;s statism  &mdash;  especially Obamacare&rsquo;s individual mandate  &mdash;  catalyzed concern for the American project of limited government.</p>

		<p>Rick Perry is just playing the card he has been dealt.  Whites are the 2nd largest demographic in Texas, behind Hispanics.  The fact that prior US government officials (both Democrats AND Republicans) have had no interest in meaningful border security has allowed the demographics in Texas to shift in such a way that current and future Republican politicians have no choice but to toss a bone to Hispanics by way of an Hispanic appointment or two if they plan to get elected.</p>

		<p>Alex Jones is sometimes unreliable and sometimes likes to live in his own personal reality distortion field, but he has a really good 14-point case against the Rickroller:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/NUVRK" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/NUVRK</a></p>
<p>Apropos, because they both currently work in the same city, Austin.</p>
<p>Pay attention to 8, 11 and 13.  Keep those in mind when Perry and his drones tell you about Texas&rsquo;s job growth.  And I&rsquo;m pointing out 8, 11 and 13 because even if you didn&rsquo;t know any better, and didn&rsquo;t know Texas was right up against Mexico, those things are clear indicators of a given state becoming more and more Hispanic.</p>
<p>Obviously, Jones openly brings up the immigration issue in 12, and most of the rest of these cases are directly or indirectly linked to the Hispanicization of Texas, and/or Texas&rsquo;s &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; relations with Mexico.  Even #14, about the forced HPV vaccine  &mdash;  While Perry&rsquo;s links to Big Pharma are a better explanation, there is probably a racial undercurrent there too because Hispanics like to start in on sex at early ages, often involuntarily and illegally.</p>
<p>His &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; rhetoric is all wind and, well, you know.</p>

		<p>Rick Perry is a globalist.  In fact, most of the 2012 presidential candidates are globalists.  The only way we are going to get our country back is to vote third party.  And, I don&rsquo;t want to hear any white nationalist/race realist say it would be a wasted vote.  Do you really think voting either major party is not a wasted vote?  A wasted vote is voting in the lesser of two evils.  Send all the globalists a message and vote third party!<br>

		<p>Is that a fact that his ancestor was sold there? Or is that one of those fictitious embellishment&rsquo;s liberals love to throw in.</p>

		<p>I wondered for years why Rick Perry wears his collars up to his chin. It dawned on me as I watched him the other night, that it&rsquo;s not the collars. He has no neck. This will not prevent him from tossing his hat - and maybe his boots - into the Presidential ring, but a long line of Hispanics would be following him. He wanted amnesty before he didn&rsquo;t want it. Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t let the new &#8220;Rick&#8221; fool you. He&rsquo;ll have to supply the big business Texans with cheap labor.</p>

		<p>Rick Perry is the biggest fraud going. He&rsquo;s a big government, open borders NeoCon parading around as an advocate for state&rsquo;s rights. He&rsquo;s been pushing so hard for private tollways and land confiscation for the NAFTA superhighway that his governorship was at play during the republican primary. The Tea Party candidate was the one that ran AGAINST him, if that says anything about what kind of establishment politician he is. He would be be nothing but a GW Bush II.   </p>

		<p>As a Texan I approach the idea of a Perry presidency with some degree of pessimism. First off he is a G W Bush prodigy who once was a democrat and supported Al Gore in an early bid for a Dem presidential nomination. He is just another rich Texas politician who knows how to play the political chessboard. Don&rsquo;t expect any brilliant displays of statesmanship from him. He&rsquo;ll always make the move that benefits his poll numbers in the most positive way. That being said I would probably support him in a run for the Whitehorse simply because he will-hopefully- be a buffer against some of Congresses more radical measures like new gun control legislation. When it comes down to it I think he is a better choice against Obama than any of the other Repubs now in the running. After almost 12 years as Texas Gov, for me he is a known factor and I&rsquo;m much more comfortable with that.  </p>
