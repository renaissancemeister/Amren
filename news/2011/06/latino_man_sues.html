<h1>Latino Man Sues Seattle Police, City over Detention and Ethnic Comment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Miletich, The Seattle Times, June 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal lawsuit was filed against the city of Seattle on Wednesday over the highly publicized incident last year in which a Seattle police officer threatened to beat the &#8220;Mexican piss&#8221; out of a Latino man who was detained during a robbery investigation.</p>
<p>The suit, brought by Martin Monetti Jr., the target of the comment, alleged that Officer Shandy Cobane also kicked him in the head and hand during the incident.</p>
<p>It seeks unspecified general and punitive damages for alleged civil-rights violations, unreasonable use of force, assault and battery, outrageous conduct, emotional harm and intentional discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cobane was suspended last month by Police Chief John Diaz for 30 days for the remark  &mdash;  the most severe punishment allowed short of firing.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement addressing the suit, the Police Department said Cobane and other officers responded to a report of an armed robbery involving a machete.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Seattle Police Department and Officer Cobane have acknowledged that statements made by him to Mr. Monetti during the April 17, 2010, stop were unacceptable,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flanked by his mother, father and sister, Monetti said, &#8220;I hope it will become a Police Department that the community trusts and respects instead of one that the community fears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monetti, who read from a prepared statement and didn&rsquo;t take questions, said he was bothered that other officers &#8220;stood around and watched and did nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cobane, a decorated officer who has served on the department for more than 17 years, also was demoted from gang detective to officer as a result of the incident. He promised to meet with Latino groups to repair relations and agreed to speak to other officers about the importance of racial and ethnic sensitivity.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Monetti went with two friends to the China Harbor Restaurant on the night of April 16, 2010, to celebrate his 21st birthday.</p>
<p>While in the parking lot, they witnessed an armed robbery but were not participants, according to the suit.</p>
<p>Soon after, Monetti and one of the men began walking to a car when they were approached about 1:30 a.m. April 17 by police officers and ordered to get on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monetti complied with this and all other commands issued by the officers,&#8221; the suit says.</p>
<p>While Monetti was prone, Cobane used his foot to kick and stomp on Monetti&rsquo;s head and hand several times, according to the suit.</p>

		<p>It sounds like a groundless cause of action.  First of all, if the description of the robbery suspects bear a resemblance to him, then they probably had grounds for the investigative detention.  Secondly, if he had not filed a timely Tort Claims Act Notice of Claim, then the trial court has no jurisdiction over use of &#8220;Mexican&#8221; under the circumstances, as slander per se amounts to no more than a common law tort, not a constitutional tort, according to, e.g., Paul v. Davis, U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

		<p>This reminds me of an incident here in Australia a while ago at a cricket match. I know most of you chaps reading Am Ren either don&rsquo;t know what cricket is, or hate it, but I&rsquo;ll get to the point.</p>
<p>An Australian player got &#8216;run-out&rsquo; (dismissed) by an opponent from Sri Lanka. Said player was heard to yell on his way to the dressing-room, &#8220;F@#!ing Black C**t&#8221;! Needless to say, all over Australian television for the next several days were all-sorts of hand-wringing and oh-my-god-ing about this Aussie player&rsquo;s horrible racist outburst.</p>
<p>I was watching the news with my Mum and she pointed out the fact that no-one seemed to be offended by the use of the words C**t or F**K. I would think that most normal people would be offended, or certainly be put &#8216;ill-at-ease&rsquo; in a public situation when some bloke yells out F**K or C**T.</p>

		<p>Is there video?  I recently had a gun shoved in my face by a cop who thought I was part of a breakin at a library of all places.  </p>
<p>That place, which I did patronize, is covered by cameras, active area sensors and dual layer perimeter breach alarms because of all the DHS stuff that is in the basement maintenance areas.</p>
<p>If there had been a break-in, I would have been rousted when it happened and not at 9 in the morning as I was preparing to go inside.</p>
<p>Had the man simply checked the video, the supposed &#8216;broken glass&rsquo; (which I was too small to fit through anyway) would have told him if any silhouettes matched my biometric and I would not have had to go nine rounds with the Inquisition over legitimately checked _library books_ and a personal laptop.</p>
<p>This is the other side of &#8216;racial tensions&rsquo; folks.  I&rsquo;m white.  I did _nothing_ to deserve the 9mm rousting I got.  But because of deteriorating conditions, law enforcement is going to be twitchy and stupid.  Probably by quota.</p>
