<h1><a href="https://www.jbhe.com/latest/news/6-9-11/ncaa.html">Black Colleges Bear the Brunt of the NCAA&rsquo;s APR Penalties</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>JBHE Weekly Bulletin, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The APR scores measure academic progress towards a degree, retention of student athletes, and the graduation rate of student athletes.</p>
<p>This year, 33 of the 103 institutions that received some form of sanctions from the NCAA were historically black colleges and universities. Half of the 58 schools that received the most severe penalties, including loss of athletics scholarships, were HBCUs. Of all schools assessed for the APR report, only 7 percent are HBCUs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NCAA&rsquo;s Committee on Academic Performance is in the process of reviewing the APR assessment and penalties. They have indicated that they will address the fact that the system has a severe negative impact on black colleges and universities.</p>

		<p>But all races are the same! Thats what Ive been told over and over and over my entire life, yet my eyes and multitude of other senses tell me otherwise time and time again. This story just reinforces what my observations already tell me. Kind of reminds of the disproportionate stats concerning blacks and crime. But trends and stats are just racisist bigotry&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the system has a severe negative impact on black[s]&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, where have I heard something like this just recently?  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, in that article about the DOJ and the city of Dayton, Ohio in last Friday&rsquo;s edition of AmRen (June 10):</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;it has a statistically significant disparate impact upon African American[s]&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, nationwide we are changing the rules because rigid standards have a way of discriminating against blacks, and according to all authorities, we must &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; and integrate them into every aspect of our lives.  </p>
<p>It seems every day the bar is dropped a little lower.  And to think; segregationists were concerned about the negative &#8220;impact&#8221; blacks&rsquo; social equality would have on us whites.  I wonder what they were thinking&hellip;?  </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s right - change and lower those standards post haste. After all, it is the new(African)American way!! </p>

		<p>It sounds like blacks have a severe negative impact on black colleges and universities.</p>

<p>Well the logical conclusion, based on this report, would be the exact opposite. It would appear that blacks have a negative impact on colleges and universities.</p>

		<p>If a group of white schools were not passing black athletes, the blacks would be all over the schools like white on rice to find out why they were so racist giving their black athletes lousy teachers and treating them like dumb animals they could work like slaves and then throw away without a care when their eligibility was over (cue the violins) &hellip;  like the white Massa beating and killing his slaves!</p>
<p>Of course, since it is a BLACK college that is unable to teach its black athletes the &#8220;racist&#8221; is not the black college, it is the NCAA, which ratted out the black college and disclosed the fact that the black college is exploiting black athletes.</p>
<p>There really is absolutely no way you can win with blacks!  The notion that the NCAA is discriminating against black athletes is absurd. It is the black colleges that get the worst black students, those black athletes that are as dumb as a box of rocks. The black colleges also get black teachers that are utterly incompetent.  With stupid students and stupid teachers, of course the schools&rsquo; pass rates are bad.  But no one can say this, of course.</p>

		<p>High standards are racist. There you go, liberals, lie your way out of evidence that utterly damns your position.</p>
