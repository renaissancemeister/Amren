<h1>Report: Most Illegal Immigrants Come from Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Bedard, U.S. News, June 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new congressional report sure to stir up the heated immigration debate finds that about 1 in 4 foreigners in America are here illegally and that 62 percent of them come from Mexico through America&rsquo;s most porous border. Using brand new data, the Congressional Budget Office also reports that 25 percent of &#8220;noncitizens,&#8221; or those here illegally or with temporary passes, live in poverty.<br>
 </p>
<p>Overall, the CBO found that there are about 39 million foreign-born people living in the United States, making up more than 12 percent of the population, which is the largest since 1920, the height of the European migration to the United States. Of those, about 10.8 million are here illegally and the subject of much of the discussion in the immigration debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From the CBO report, Director Douglas Elmendorf highlighted the following points on his blog:</p>
<p>•	In 2009, about 38 percent of foreign-born people in the United States were from Mexico or Central America; the next-largest group came from Asia and accounted for 27 percent of the total foreign-born population.</p>
<p>•	About one-fifth of naturalized U.S. citizens were from Mexico or Central America; more than one-third were from Asia. About half of the noncitizens living in the United States in 2009 were from Mexico or Central America, and about one-fifth were from Asia. An estimated 62 percent of noncitizens unauthorized to live in the United States were from Mexico.</p>
<p>•	From 2000 to 2009, more than 10 million people were granted legal permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States. Legal permanent residents are permitted to live, work, and study in the United States. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>•	Marriage and fertility rates are generally higher among young foreign-born women than among their native-born counterparts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>•	The amount of annual earnings among foreign-born workers varied greatly by country of origin. For example, in 2009 the median annual earnings of male workers from Mexico and Central America was $22,000. Among male workers from Asia, the median was $48,000; among male workers from Europe and Canada, it was $53,000; and among native-born male workers, it was $45,000.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t possibly care less that 25% of &#8216;non-citizens&rsquo; here live in poverty. If they weren&rsquo;t here, maybe so many Americans wouldn&rsquo;t be living in poverty.</p>
<p>What the bleeding hearts don&rsquo;t want you to figure out is that poverty here is upper middle class in Mexico.</p>

		<p>As I have read it nancy pelosi said there were 20,000,000 illegals here at the time she said it.  She should know.  Since that time about two years ago how many more came here.  White women in large cities average one child each while our alleged minorites average 8-10 children with some up to 24.  That 24 figure is accurate as i worked with a woman in Alaska who was one of 24 children.  One woman on welfare with 10 kids and each of them having ten kids and each of them having ten kids etc leads to our future as a nation.  long before all those grand kids are born welfare will run out of money and the welfare folk will look around and see who has the money they want.  Then the benefits of our ignorance will be reaped to the full.</p>

<p>Well well, who&rsquo;d have ever guessed? As for them living in poverty, I live in poverty, too, because over one-third of our income goes in taxes of all sorts of various types to pay for their lifestyle. My husband and I have ONE 9 year old car, and the Mexicans drive around in brand new, (uninsured, naturally) cars. They have section 8 housing. Their fat, filthy kids play between the cars jacked up on cement blocks in their front yard mudpits wearing designer clothes, I could go on and on, but you all know the score. </p>

		<p>This is a remarkable and wholly unexpected revelation.  I had assumed that the majority of our illegals were from North Korea.<br>
Just goes to show that things aren&rsquo;t always what they appear to be.</p>

		<p>News flash, lightly protected border between poor developing nation and the United States with huge social benefits finds large number of illegal immigrants crossing over.  What next, sun rises in east and sets in the west?</p>

		<p>One of the many sad things about this report is that it probably cost $300,000 to produce, yet:</p>
<p>1) Everyone already knew this<br>
2) Nothing will be done about the problem being studied</p>
