<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=312489">&#8216;Progressive&rsquo; Power Via Immigration</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Vinson, World Net Daily, June 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Progressives&#8221; really don&rsquo;t care that illegal immigration is illegal. Just recently, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said it was just awful that Republicans regard illegal immigration as a crime. And indeed, if you don&rsquo;t care about the worth of American citizenship and the security of our borders  &mdash;  in short, if you don&rsquo;t really care about the American nation  &mdash;  the illegal breaking and entering into the country really isn&rsquo;t anything to lose sleep about. As professor Samuel Huntington observed in his book, &#8220;Who Are We?&#8221; many of our progressive elites are &#8220;transnationals,&#8221; folks who feel they have risen above such painfully backward thinking as patriotism.</p>
<p>They claim that their affections extend to everyone on planet earth and that legal and illegal are meaningless distinctions. Maybe. But one must wonder how anyone with no particular love for his country and countrymen could really love anyone else  &mdash;  any more than a father who denies special love for his own children can convincingly claim to love all kids. If &#8220;progressives&#8221; really love immigrants, as they claim, one would think that they would want them to come in small enough numbers, by the rules, so they would assimilate. Otherwise, they simply will replicate what they ran away from.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what is happening. So we might inquire if the progressives have another motive. One thing about them we know for sure is that despite their lack of love for America, they passionately love the power they derive from American government. Frustrating them intensely in this quest, however, is a Middle American electorate suspicious of their ideologies and schemes. For progressives, an obvious solution would be to replace Middle America with a new electorate they can more easily control and manipulate  &mdash;  one such as impoverished and unassimilated immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When anyone tries to expose the electorate replacement strategy, progressives typically respond by labeling the accuser as a &#8220;racist,&#8221; a &#8220;hater,&#8221; or one of their other standard and hackneyed smear words. The purpose is to divert attention from their brazen subversion of nationhood and democracy  &mdash;  and their boundless lust for power. Sensible limits on immigration are the only way to stop them. To achieve those limits, patriotic Americans must vote progressives out of office while they still have the votes to do it.</p>

		<p>Democrats are delusional if they think they benefit from a large influx of third world immigrants. The political center in the United States is to the right of where it is in Western Europe because loyalties of race and ethnicity are stronger than loyalties of class. <br>
 <br>
White employees in Europe are more likely to vote for left wing politicians because they have a smaller percentage of non whites in their countries to feel threatened by. <br>
 <br>
During the 1930s the New Deal was only possible because immigration was restricted, and because civil rights legislation was kept off of the agenda of the Roosevelt Administration. <br>
 <br>
The Democrat Party needs to win back much of the South, and most of the white working class. It cannot do so by opposing restrictions on immigration. </p>

		<p>Debbie Wasserman Schultz will soon say how awful to lock up murderers, rapist, thieves. And how dare them, they are not allowed to vote.  All she care about are votes.  Laws they just get in the way.  How far will this country let these kind of people stay in office?  They are no better than the ones running the show in third world countries.</p>

		<p>Below a certain level of intelligence, human beings are attracted to politicians who promise to give them things. Establish a democracy with universal suffrage and get enough of these people in the same place, and you get an Emmanuel or Bloomberg elected to office. These guys love the power, love the control, and ultimately use it to their own advantage, renting out political influence in their own personal utopia.</p>
<p>The only problem with this human arrangement is that it consumes more resources than it generates. Remove outside sources of social services funding, like, say, in the hyper-inflation scenario, and these urban communities will quickly end up celebrating their diversity in the form of a &lsquo;free fire zone&rsquo; as humans do what they do competing for scarce resources.  The Mayors, by this time having figured out that their constituents won&rsquo;t make much of a conquering army clamoring to honor their beneficence, will already have left by helicopter.</p>
<p>And then this whole place will need to be re-built.</p>

		<p>Paging the Republican Party! </p>
<p>You will never get a majority of the &#8220;Latino&#8221; electorate no matter how much you pander to them. A majority will always vote for the party that promises them the most government funded goodies. The reason for this is obvious; their pervasively higher rate of poverty which often persists in the the 3rd and 4th generations. It&rsquo;s because a larger segment of &#8220;Latinos&#8221; are dullards compared with whites. And no matter how uncomfortable it may be to acknowlege that genetics are a factor is this, things will only get worse and worse if we continue to deny the obvious. </p>

		<p>The irony is that those most likely to illegally immigrate into the US are those that will break the back of progressive redistributionist schemes: welfare, retirement, medical care, etc.</p>
<p>They take out FAR more than they pay in. Recipe for disaster.</p>

This ought to be handed out, mailed out, dropped from planes, whatever it takes, because if this message isn&rsquo;t understood and acted upon, there is no future for anyone in the U.S., and the world will not stand when American collapses into a third world hellhole.</p>

		<p>This conspiracy of the left to circumvent the nation&rsquo;s system of racial checks and balances through a policy of replacing the native white population with nonwhite immigrants is surely a treasonous act which, I hope, will someday be treated as such by an American society that finally comes to its senses.</p>

		<p>Millions of unassimilating immigrants were brought in to the Uk by the labour party to simply &#8220;rub the right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&rsquo; as quoted by a leader of the labour party. the sane is happening here,<br>
I now go to numbersusa and check the immigration voting grade of all candidadtes before I vote, and vote for the person with the best grade,regardless of party.<br>
Numbersusa also allows you to fax your weasels in washington for free!</p>

		<p>Whatever led up to the Brown v. Board integration disaster was also leading up to &#8220;borders are just a racist construct&#8221;. (Boaz, Myrdall, Montigu) Trace all of our current horrors to Brown.  Everything yet to come, comes out of Brown.</p>
<p>When the unelected SCOTUS told White parents that they had no right to determine whom their White children would sit next to in class, share a water fountain or toilet seat, the game was up.  Just a matter of time before White America would be racists for not taxing themselves high enough to care for all the world&rsquo;s colored populations.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t fight back against the victorious waves and swarms of color who will eventually own everything you&rsquo;ve got, especially your retirement investments.  That&rsquo;s the next big transfer- your retirement portfolio will be confiscated to pay the interest on the federal debt. The congressional black caucus always vote for more debt, so they were voting to take your money away from you.   That&rsquo;s the Africa in them- they can&rsquo;t help themselves.  </p>
<p>The class warfare tricks of &#8220;oppressive inequities that are vestiges of shameful and outdated White privilege must be stopped!  Until everyone has a retirement plan, nobody gets one!&#8221; will become as commonplace as Diversity is our Strength. That&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Whites raped the Earth through oppression, marginalization, slavery, segregation, imperialism, and colonialism, so now Earth gets justice through the beloved communities of color taking everything away from Whitey.</p>
<p>Whites are not rioting against Brown, so don&rsquo;t expect us to really do much about the illegal invasion.  </p>
<p>The state anti-immigrant laws are all show, just like George Wallace in the school house door.  He surrendered as soon as was expedient, and so will Az, Al, Ga, etc.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Dems will get 5 on the SCOTUS, then all barriers to illegals will be struck down.  Obama will get second term and another supreme addition.</p>
<p>Brown doomed us, so now just suffer doom, Whitey!<br>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Then we haven&rsquo;t shot/hung/electrocuted someone for treason in too long.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
And indeed, if you don&rsquo;t care about the worth of American citizenship and the security of our borders &mdash; in short, if you don&rsquo;t really care about the American nation &mdash; the illegal breaking and entering into the country really isn&rsquo;t anything to lose sleep about.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>They have their own countries.  They are called &#8216;gated communities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
As professor Samuel Huntington observed in his book, &ldquo;Who Are We?&rdquo; many of our progressive elites are &ldquo;transnationals,&rdquo; folks who feel they have risen above such painfully backward thinking as patriotism.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I feel about transnationalists the same way as I do transexuals: If you ain&rsquo;t equipped for the mission, stop wearing the uniform.</p>
<p>Put another way, until and unless these people start getting paid in NWO Dollars (Renminbi, Euro, whatever) _they work for us_.</p>
<p>And oh, wouldn&rsquo;t there be a profound wailing and gnashing of teeth if these poor, skillless, bastards suddenly found that the USG wasn&rsquo;t depositing that $14,500 per month they depend on, &#8216;for necessities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Like gated communities.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
They claim that their affections extend to everyone on planet earth and that legal and illegal are meaningless distinctions. Maybe. But one must wonder how anyone with no particular love for his country and countrymen could really love anyone else &mdash; any more than a father who denies special love for his own children can convincingly claim to love all kids. If &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; really love immigrants, as they claim, one would think that they would want them to come in small enough numbers, by the rules, so they would assimilate. Otherwise, they simply will replicate what they ran away from.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I seriously doubt if any of these sheltered individuals have seen the likes of Mumbai, Mexico City, or Kibera.  They certainly haven&rsquo;t seen Detroit.</p>
<p>Or they would realize that America _already is_ a third world country.</p>
<p>Gated Communities&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
And that is exactly what is happening. So we might inquire if the progressives have another motive. One thing about them we know for sure is that despite their lack of love for America, they passionately love the power they derive from American government. Frustrating them intensely in this quest, however, is a Middle American electorate suspicious of their ideologies and schemes. For progressives, an obvious solution would be to replace Middle America with a new electorate they can more easily control and manipulate &mdash; one such as impoverished and unassimilated immigrants.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Not to slight Milton, but one of those drawbacks of &#8216;ruling from heaven, a gangland hell&rsquo; that is seldom mentioned is that THERE IS LESS MONEY TO CONTROL.</p>
<p>Previously, the smart elites knew that the one group they could not afford to deny or cheat was other elites because those people were motivated to get rich at all costs whereas the rest of us were just mindless sheep that went to church and believed in moral living (or so the theory goes).</p>
<p>The problem being that when you turn the flock into &#8216;ewesless&rsquo; social welfare dependents who breed out of all control and have NO SOCIAL CONSCIENCE, suddenly it is the Elites who are too many for the much reduced resources available.</p>
<p>And so you are right back to that cut-throat game between people who think they deserve it all.  And will kill each other to get it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
When anyone tries to expose the electorate replacement strategy, progressives typically respond by labeling the accuser as a &ldquo;racist,&rdquo; a &ldquo;hater,&rdquo; or one of their other standard and hackneyed smear words.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Libtards always pull the R-word when they know you are both right and correct.  Wear it proudly.  So that, when the day comes, you may toss them off YOUR lands to their ethnic replacement population with the honest insistance that:  &#8220;YOU&rsquo;RE _NOT_ RACIST!&#8221;</p>
<p>There are times, when it gets really bad here, that all I live for, is that day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The purpose is to divert attention from their brazen subversion of nationhood and democracy &mdash; and their boundless lust for power. Sensible limits on immigration are the only way to stop them. To achieve those limits, patriotic Americans must vote progressives out of office while they still have the votes to do it.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which will never happen until we have the means to separate from their control.  Thanks to recent appointments and EOs they now have utter dominance of the legislative and judicial branches.  They have on and off owned the executive since Reagan at least.</p>
<p>Like firefighters setting back burns in a forest blaze, we need to sabotage enough of the country&rsquo;s remaining infrastructure that it fails, financially, by regions.</p>
<p>We can then declare separation and hope the place is such a shambles that the notion of &#8216;national&rsquo; borders is revealed for the farce it really is.</p>
<p>ONLY THEN, with control over Malmstrom and Minot and Warren, will we be able to say, &#8220;See&rsquo;ya!&#8221; _and mean it_.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember here folks is that the USA as a legacy/transition state is key to the establishment of transnationalist world government.  If we aren&rsquo;t here, the process folds.</p>
<p>That may not be true for much longer, but believe me, you _do not_ want to see the results of Global Corporate Socialism.  The last folks who tried that particular stunt wore red &amp; white bands with little black spiders on their sleeves.</p>

While it does seem likely that Democrats support illegal immigration in order to dilute Conservative Republican voting, it doesn&rsquo;t explain why CR&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t on to the game.</p>
<p>I know CR&rsquo;s are hoping for cross-over votes and support illegal immigration because it&rsquo;s &#8216;good for American business interests&rsquo;, but I find it difficult to believe that CR&rsquo;s are this ignorant or blind to what Democrats are doing (even if Sam Francis dubbed them &#8216;the stupid party&rsquo;).<br>
 <br>
I do believe the premise is valid that Democrats are hoping to bring in enough new liberal voters to end Republican power.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a disgusting strategy the leftists have used to advance their Marxist agendas but it has worked wondrously.  White Americans hold ancient Anglo-Saxon traditions that are individualistic and the antithesis to Marxism.  So importing peoples from backwards third world countries is a much easier task to persuade people to put them in power.  Convincing them that all their problems are due to a fictitious generic term known as &#8216;White Racism&rsquo; is a great way to exploit inferior peoples&rsquo; jealousy.  They could care less if it destroys the country in the process.</p>

		<p>This is a terrific article.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true liberals and left wingers care not one iota for America as an idea, a country that is distinct from all the other countries of the earth.  They are internationalists in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Immigrants are but political fodder to them, instruments to fill their numbers.  They do this with the lure that a pepetually refillable hog trough of unlimited socio-government sustenance awaits them.  Paid for by guess who?</p>
<p>It is essential that the millions of illegal aliens here be denied citizenship, benefits, and employment.  This is the only way they will leave.  They must leave or they will change the very nature of the country.  </p>
<p>They must leave, for it is the only way to keep America American.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s already happening   &mdash;   surreptitiously, yes.  Everyone needs to pay attention to your words.  The following is from financial guru Lee Bellinger, who has been warning of government confiscation of YOUR retirement accounts for years.</p>
<p>June, 2011:</p>
<p><i>The biggest source of heretofore largely untapped revenue for U.S. politicians is private retirement accounts. The 40l(k)/IRA de-privatization plan is the brain-child of one of the left&rsquo;s rising stars, the bright and inventive leftwing academic Teresa Ghilarducci.</i></p>
<p><i> Ghilarducci declared&hellip;the government, will invest and manage the pooled savings. That&rsquo;s because Ghilarducci believes, &#8216;Humans often lack the foresight, discipline, and investing skills required to sustain a savings plan.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Retirement account de-privatization is being advanced by the powerful Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, key Congressional leaders and Vice President Joe Biden&rsquo;s White House Middle Class Task Force.  Ghilarducci stated: &#8216;I&rsquo;m just rearranging the tax breaks that are available now for 40l(k)s and spreading – spreading the wealth&hellip;&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>In recent weeks, the media widely reported that the U.S. Treasury has begun &#8216;extraordinary measures&rsquo; to fund the federal government&hellip; As of last month, federal employee pension funds are being raided to fund government operating deficits.</i></p>
<p>For superb information, see here:  <a href="http://goo.gl/vhiJG" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/vhiJG</a></p>
<p>Take heed everyone.   I saw these prescient words on a bumper sticker yesterday:</p>
<p><i>Stop Repeat Offenders!  Don&rsquo;t  Re-elect  Them!</i></p>
<p>Wise words, those;  imagine the words of The Prophet written on a bumper sticker!   And, again, take heed.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>I just read an article about an Arizona Sheriff who pointed out that Obama is putting 1200 Natl.Guards on the border for 3 months and there are 28,500 troops on the Korean border and have been there for 58 years to protect South Korea.  South Korea is now a very rich nation.  He also pointed out that people who believe in protecting the border and enforcing the law are now called racists and other names by many democrats.</p>

		<p>I wish democrats would just admit this strategy and be up front about it, but Cultural Marxists are liars to the core. They are experts at playing the empathy card. I always wonder how the republicans that support amnesty don&rsquo;t mind that they are ushering in a future democrat majority government with each invader. The first world populations will be taxed into oblivion to provide services to the invading hordes.       </p>

		<p>Events are marching us past the voting booths, so to speak, and I don&rsquo;t think we should think of illegal immigration (an oxymoron since immigration is a legal process), as well as unrestricted immigration in purely political terms anymore. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have the will to solve the problem and are deluding themselves in thinking they can benefit from the issue one way or the other. Both are in too deep to really rock the boat.</p>
<p>No one is really doing anything about the illegals. A few laws get passed here and there, but there is no systematic approach even to securing the borders, much less rounding up those already here. Indeed, government, both on the federal and local level often create impediments to such an approach by creating sanctuaries and loop-holes for the illegals that are caught.</p>
<p>The path we are on will lead to the complete transmogrification of our country and culture and God only knows how many &#8220;unintended consequences.&#8221; We have no way of predicting those as we lack a suitable foundation to do so under the PC dictatorship. We must all think right (left) and learn new-speak. We have some freedom to babble on about race and race politics, like here, but no one will venture to voice that maybe the reason these people (non-whites in general) don&rsquo;t do so well - world wide - is because they are stupid and can&rsquo;t handle living in a modern society. Maybe everybody can&rsquo;t be &#8220;equal.&#8221; But we pretend they can and lose money to &#8220;prove&#8221; it. If only we could give them more opportunities, better schools, etc., ad nauseum, they will become like us!</p>
<p>Fat chance. Our own little experiment with non-whites has gone on now for 150 years since the Emancipation Proclamation, with our full complicity for over six decades since the civil rights movement. The outcome is all around you if you live here, and it&rsquo;s not exactly what we had in mind when we started it (unintended consequences!). So now we want more, whether they are Mexicans or Somalis? They have even less intent of integrating. They are here to suck us dry, that&rsquo;s all, and that includes the smarter ones from India and Asia.</p>
<p>Transnationals do not believe in borders. That means they cannot by definition be patriots. Patriots are by definition nationalists, whatever else they may be. That&rsquo;s my litmus test. Feel sorry for the &ldquo;tired, your poor, your hungry, your huddled masses&hellip;&rdquo; but let them stay where they are. We&rsquo;re full up and have our own problems.</p>

<p>They claim that their affections extend to everyone on planet earth and that legal and illegal are meaningless distinctions. Maybe. But one must wonder how anyone with no particular love for his country and countrymen could really love anyone else &mdash; any more than a father who denies special love for his own children can convincingly claim to love all kids&hellip; </p>

<p>Anonymous,</p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head with that one. My father was 1st generation Irish, poor, and he was a conservative man. He was a staunch Catholic who went to Mass every Sunday, went to Catholic schools and, when he was old enough, worked after school to pay for tuition. He even managed to finish 2 years of college at a time when a High School Diploma was an achievement. He and 5 of his 6 brothers joined the Army when WWII broke out and he stayed in and worked his way up to rank of Colonel. He loved this country.</p>
<p>My mother, on the other hand, was from old American stock, German and Pennsylvania Dutch. She came from a family of liberals and progressives. She hated the U.S., thought that White people were the scum of the earth, and was always carrying on about the &#8220;poor Negro,&#8221; the starving in Africa, the poor Japanese, Chinese, Indians, whatever other race or ethnic group was in fashion at the moment. </p>
<p>However, she treated my father and me very badly. I&rsquo;m in my sixties now and still carry the scars from her arrogance and selfishness. The whole world revolved around her.   </p>

		<p>Hispanics are the new Blacks. I don&rsquo;t remember if I saw this headline (assertion} on this website or another, but the implications of that statement should be alarming to all of us who want to preserve the heritage of our fathers and forefathers. Its even more alarming  when you consider that Hispanics achieve, both economically and scholastically, at several times the rate of their black counterparts. Indeed there are exceptions. In a recent University of Texas Law School Honors Class there was at least one individual of Hispanic heritage but no Blacks. I bring this up because having an economically advantaged and well educated underclass to exploit is a boon to progressives and their sinister agenda to move this country into a new socialist world order.</p>
<p>Role the clock back almost fifty years and you&rsquo;ll find good ole&rsquo; LBJ trying to pull off the same thing with blacks and his Great America program. If you have any doubts look up that speech he made at Howard University where he declared he knew exactly why Blacks were living in poverty and squalor. I&rsquo;ll give you a hint. They were held back by bad mean old racist white folks. He signed into law, in rapid succession, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, The Voting Rights Act, and the Immigration Act of 1965. All the while remarking that the the n*****s were sure to vote the Democratic ticket in perpetuity. Of course even with all the Government entitlements and affirmative action programs Blacks have failed for the most part to move ahead. In fact conditions in inner cities have become progressively worse.</p>
<p>Now move forward to the first years  of the twenty first century when most progressives are fond of declaring that our Constitution is invalid and meaningless because it was written by a bunch of white slave owners. And our country has become so embarrassing to them that they declare themselves to be &#8216;Citizens of the World&rsquo;. Hispanics are the perfect group for progressives to exploit thanks to the fourteenth amendment. Disadvantaged politically, with doubtful allegiance to the Constitution, numerous with a high fertility rate, and a powerful intelligent well educated upper class able to move in political circles of which Blacks could only dream. I can only imagine what kind of Government we&rsquo;ll have in a few years especially if a Comprehensive Amnesty Bill is ever passed.</p>
<p>Angel Reyes an attorney practicing law in Dallas, Tx has written a book entitled &#8216;Hispanic Heresy&rsquo; in which he asserts the economic importance of Hispanic immigrants and their contributions to American society while lamenting the growing phobia against Hispanics and the  resistance to illegal immigration and general amnesty.</p>
<p>He states in part that:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, all this worrying about undocumented immigrants is for nothing,The country has been there before. We need to realize that the work force of tomorrow is Latino, and Hispanic immigration is an opportunity we shouldn&rsquo;t squander.&#8221; </p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t raise a red flag I don&rsquo;t know what will. We are in danger of losing the country of our fathers and what a terrible day that will be.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Let it be beyond doubt and forever known that Democrats brought ethnic cleansing to America&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong, Wrong, Wrong! If that were true why during the first years of the Bush administration when they had control of all branches of government did they not deport all the illegals. In fact, the amount of illegals increased greatly. The idea, prevalent on some WN sites that the Repulicans are our allies is beyond naive, it borders on idiocy. The Dems sure have a lot of race traitors, but at least they are honest about it. The Repulicans are far more treasonous. He&rsquo;ll the CONservative icon Ronald Reagan, sighed amnesty. Did that teach you Repulicans lovers anything. We are much better with Obama. At least it mobilizes our people. The Repulicans give many Whites a feeling that things are better. Remember CONservatives want to conserve. Is that what AM REN readers want, to conserve the status quo? If so, turn on Limbaugh and Hannity, watch some NBA, just do not call yourselves friends of our people!<br>

<p>You got it wrong. The people with the armbands were not corporate socialists, f.ex they nerfed their treasonous banks by issuing debt-free currency and they also gave the finger to the banks of City of London by refusing to trade in the default world currency of the 30&rsquo;s, the pound sterling. Todays pound sterling is called the &#8220;oil dollar&#8221; and you may not refuse it. </p>
<p>USA is becoming something thats more akin to the late Roman empire, where wealthy special interests owned and wrecked the Empire trough their greed while the populace amused themselves with their versions of NASCAR and WWE. Few americans understand how the plutocracy loot the nation right under their noses but most are very agitated about things that are utter irrelevant in the grand scheme. Democracy, to an alien from Mars, would appear to be a bunch of enraged morons consistently voting against their own self interest.  </p>

<p> SEE, she doesn&rsquo;t hate ALL whites, just the lesser sorts (indo-europeans). </p>
<p>You have it half-right. She doesnt hate all caucasians, just the lesser sorts (the ones that are white europeans). White people are a subset of the much larger caucasian group. Or put it another way, most caucasians are actually not white. Europe&rsquo;s immigration problems are mostly caused by huge numbers of non white caucasians, people who americans are conditioned to think are just as white as Europeans because they put them in the same racial group. I just dont understand why white americans call themselves &#8220;caucasian&#8221;, its just one step away from calling themselves &#8220;human&#8221; or &#8220;world citizen&#8221;. <br>

		<p>This is a really an extreme level of treason. The Democrats, who otherwise would have drifted into political obscurity, imported its&rsquo; voting block from various  nonwhite nations. This is the textbook definition of monumental treason. And to top things off, the Democrats demand that  Native Born White Americans tolerate-in complete silence-this monumental treason. </p>
<p>But it is more than treason, this is a policy decision whose open intent is to race-replace the Native Born White American Majority with post-1965 high-fertility foreigners and their &#8220;American&#8221; born gene line. This is an open declaration of a  race  war against the Native Born White American Majority by the Democratic Party. As far as I am concerned, the Democratic Party has no political legitimacy..or legitimacy of any kind..at the very least it should be registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of any number of nonwhite foreign nations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of you here are throwing the word Marxist around  ia very unintelligent way. The Democratic Party policy of race-replacing the Native Born White Majority is the implementation of the low wage labor policy of the Corporations..which requires our race-replacement. It is very important to get the facts right and state them publicly, for otherwise, you are going to come across as very silly..and you won&rsquo;t be taken seriously at all. </p>
<p>What I have just written above  are the fundamental facts of the current situation. And these are the facts that Native Born White American Patriots should be stating in public&hellip;over and over again.</p>

<p>I think that part of the problem is that the real definition of Caucasian has been increasingly modified for a long time.  When I first learned it, decades ago, it mean &#8220;those living and north and west of the Caucasus Mountains because they were a natural barrier for thousands of years that prevented racial and cultural traits from the south in the north, just as the Ural Mountains kept Europe safe from Asia for thousands, tens of thousands of years.  It was relatively lately that invasion of the Caucasus themselves and others like Genghis Khan began to impact the populations.  Ancient Greek statues and other evidences inform us that the Greeks were Indo-European.  Athena was portrayed as a blonde haired, blued eyed goddess with alabaster skin.  It is time and mostly, the modern epic that has changed what used to be a reliable rule.  Transportation, trade, and notably, the Muslim objective of increased slave trading is what has allowed for the modern concept of Caucasian to become so muddled.</p>
<p>But for today&rsquo;s practical purposes, a redefinition along the lines of the Amren article you link to is probably necessary.</p>
