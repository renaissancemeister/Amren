<h1><a href="https://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2734610/posts">Just What Does It Mean to Be Called British These Days? </a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leo McKinstry, Free Republic, June 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE nation state is the greatest vehicle ever invented by mankind for the promotion of democracy and prosperity.</p>
<p>That is because it is essentially an extension of the family with citizens enjoying a shared sense of belonging, unity and heritage.</p>
<p>The tragedy of modern Britain is that our traditional identity is under remorseless political attack.</p>
<p>Mass immigration, the dogma of multiculturalism and the growing power of the European Union have conspired to undermine our British nationhood.</p>
<p>Our once unified country is in danger of becoming nothing more than a land mass filled with disparate peoples.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the year to March 2011 no fewer than 586,000 immigrants were granted entry, the vast majority from Asia and Africa. It was by far the highest total in our history, more than 10 times the average level of immigration in the Eighties.</p>
<p>As border controls weaken so the concept of British citizenship is becoming increasingly meaningless. The right to hold a British passport used to be cherished but today that privilege has been utterly devalued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Earlier this month a Parliamentary committee revealed that the Home Office had effectively granted an amnesty to 160,000 bogus refugees, allowing them to settle here permanently and claim benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There will soon be a vast new influx of arrivals from Bulgaria and Romania once the citizens of those two member states are allowed to travel and settle anywhere in Europe without restrictions, as the Brussels Parliament recommended last week.</p>
<p>Even worse more than 70 million Turkish Muslims will have the right to come to Britain if Turkey is granted EU membership, as the coalition wants.</p>
<p>What we are witnessing is a grotesque form of assisted national suicide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All around us we can see the dire consequences of the immigration free-for-all, whether it be the spread of sharia law or the prevalence of violent gangs in our inner cities or the rise of Islamic extremism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But now that ethic has been shattered. We are now forced to support millions of people who have absolutely no connection to Britain, such as the 12-strong Ethiopian family recently given a huge house in East London at a cost to the taxpayer of more than Â£75,000 a year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>AN EVEN greater myth beloved of the Left is that Britain is &#8220;a nation of immigrants&#8221; so there is supposedly nothing unique about the modern influx from Asia and Africa. But this is just a lie.</p>
<p>In fact Britain was until the Seventies one of the most homogenous nations. Moreover the small numbers that arrived here, such as Irish labourers, or Jewish or French refugees fleeing religious persecution, were steeped in the Judeo-Christian culture that built our civilisation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a land where the once uplifting ideal of national pride has been transmuted into nothing more than xenophobia decline is inevitable.</p>

		<p>Two weapons Britain used to destroy itself:</p>
<p>&#8220;The population was almost entirely European until the middle of the 20th century, but that changed because of two developments. The first was the British Nationality Act of 1948, which conferred citizenship and the right to live in Britain on all members of the Commonwealth and Empire. The Commonwealth comprised Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, while the Empire consisted of the Indian sub-continent, Hong Kong, Malaysia, most of the Caribbean islands, about one third of sub-Saharan Africa, and a number of smaller territories. This act meant that huge numbers of non-Europeans &mdash; some 800 million &mdash; had the right to live and work in Britain. Curiously, the probable consequences of this act were not much debated in the House of Commons. Clement Atlee&rsquo;s Labour government simply assumed very few British subjects would take advantage of this opportunity. It was, of course, wrong. </p>
<p>&#8220;The second development was Britain&rsquo;s adherence to the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which allowed entry of a large number of asylum seekers. The number of non-Europeans (of all races) living in Britain recorded in the census of 1951 was 138,000. By 1971, that number had increased to 751,000, and in 2001 it was a staggering 3,450,000.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Britain was one of the most truly beautiful countries in the world.  As an attractive teenager I walked from one end of it to the other in 1982, when it was still almost all white and not a hair on my head was harmed.  Actually, it was the opposite - complete strangers on buses and in pubs offered me hospitality in their homes.  I think we know what would happen to a light haired, blue-eyed teenage girl with a backpack traveling alone today.  Her body would be &#8220;discovered&#8221; after having been attacked by &#8220;youths.&#8221; That is nearly a guarantee.  In 1982 the country was still full of the same people who were the true English, the light of the world for a long, long time - they brought to so many nations much, much more than the comparable pittance they took from them (except in the case of Ireland, and in my view, that is now completely and utterly irrelevant in light of the horrors Whites face as a race).  It&rsquo;s a shame to see the place now, and in my opinion they are a beaten down people who believe the much-touted vision of themselves as colonialist oppressors.  I would have hoped they had some sand, but they don&rsquo;t seem to anymore.  Maybe this will change and we will be treated to that famously historic &#8220;British stiff upper lip&#8221; as they kick these people out of their country, which is being destroyed, utterly.  People care more about the trees in the Amazon than the fact that the British (and other white populations in small nations) are being genocided in their own country.  Frank Salter explains it well in terms of the deaths of actual British children in his book about the destruction of ethnicity by the importing of 10,000 Bantus to Britain vs. 10,000 Danes to Britain.  I felt it was an excellent analogy and then I really understood with a chill in my bones, what is being done.  I hope the British or English or whatever one chooses to call them will &#8220;revert to type&#8221; and become leaders of the Western world as they were through so much of our history.</p>

<p>Actually you are not forced to support non-British blacks in Britain.  You CHOOSE to support them by electing politicans who support your genocide.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;British Subjects&#8221; will have a whole new meaning 40 years hence.  The British will BE the subjects, and not of their monarch but of the third worlders who will off their heads.</p>

		<p><i>AN EVEN greater myth beloved of the Left is that Britain is &ldquo;a nation of immigrants&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Well, many of those leading the extreme left are indeed immigrants or children of immigrants. So for them, from their perspective,  it is entirely true. They are resentful of the native-born British, and would like to replace them. (Check out Labour MP Magaret Hodge [nÃ©e Oppenheimer], for instance, on Wikipedia.)<br>

<p>I recently came across an old encyclopedia dated  1951, discarded by a neighbor.   Randomly, I opened it amd came upon the article on Rudyard Kipling. It was amazing to see how respectfully and admiringly  he was spoken of as an unashamed champion of British  (and white)  values. </p>
<p>That was back then!  Now, I suspect he&rsquo;s hardly known at all in the schools, and is in disgrace as one of those oppressive old white males who supported the evil British Empire.  How things have utterly changed!</p>

<p>Deirdre,<br>
What a beautiful article! I&rsquo;m not English but as a Euro- American of Italian descent I can certainly appreciate <br>
your sentiments. <br>
You say it all. I&rsquo;ll never understand what&rsquo;s going on in the minds of Caucasians. How can an entire race of people lose their desire to survive. Colonialism was the best thing that ever happened to most of the Third World.  You can see what happened when they got their liberty. Nothing!! They are incapable of providing for themselves either in Africa or Middle East. After our Independence we went on to become the most successful society in history. Now we&rsquo;re headed down the same path as the rest of our Western European cousins.<br>
Our leftist &#8220;leaders&#8221; have successfully created a huge dependent underclass that is undermining the very foundations of our society and we&rsquo;re sitting by letting it happen while being stupified by reality shows and Extra, Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood, NBA, NFL etc.</p>
<p>Whites will camp out overnight outside an electronics stoy in order to be the first to get the newest anaesthesia in the form of I-Phones but will not defend their right to existas a race and a culture.<br>
We encounter the horrors of diversity daily in the media and shake our heads in dispair at the stories of murder, rape and other atrocious assaults upon other Whites by mostly Blacks whom we&rsquo;ve been supporting for over a half century.<br>
We elect leaders who don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s ass about us and console ourselves with meaningless clichÃ©s e.g &#8220;Hey, all politicians are crooks&#8221;.<br>
I wait in vain for the day when Whites rise up and take back their country and punish those who sold us out.</p>

		<p>You might be interested in a topic I heard on BBC Radio 4 this morning.  The subject of tens of thousands of migrants pouring into Southern Europe because of the Arab unrest was discussed.  A Scandinavian Euro parliamentarian was heard to express her great concern at this situation.  She was worried that it was &#8216;encouraging the rise of extreme right wing parties in Europe&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip; They still do not get the message!</p>

		<p>Some how we ended up with Obama and Holder running things in the country.  Obama&rsquo;s father was a Kikuyu which tribe was the center of the Mau Mau movement in Africa.  His father would have been fully indoctrinated into the values of mau mau.  This would have been passed on to Obama in the subtle passing of values from parent to child.  he would not come out and openly say he wants to destroy the white race obviously but he is in position to cause alot of harm.  Bring in millions of nonwhites to breed us out while advancing the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of these same foreign people beats down the white folk.  White folk need to unify and to get back their back bone while there is still time.</p>

<p>rockman,</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;father&#8221; was of the Luo tribe which was a rival of the dominant Kikuyu people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right about the Kikuyu and the Mau Mau movement one of whose leaders was Jomo Kenyatta who later became President. Kinda like appointing Mumiya Abu Jamal as Philadelphia&rsquo;s Police Commissioner.</p>
<p>Truth be told it doesn&rsquo;t matter from what tribe he originated. They&rsquo;re all cut from the same cloth pretty much like their fellow Blacks here in the United States of Alienation. </p>

<p>Sorry, but you&rsquo;re way off here.  Obama senior was a Luo tribesman, not Kikuyu. And since he abandoned Obama junior as a very young child, he could not have passed along his values.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how much you criticize, but let&rsquo;s at least stick to facts and not fantasy so that we won&rsquo;t look foolish.</p>

<p><br>
They are far from &#8220;all the same&#8221;.  American &#8220;blacks&#8221; are all mixed together, but not in Africa. When I was in Kenya, I was very impressed by the tremendous variation between the tribes.<br>
Not only physically, but even in personalities.  Historically, they did not like one ahother (still don&rsquo;t) and did not intermingle. Each one was a separate breeding pool in itself.</p>
<p>They were basically, and naturally, xenophobic! Unlike us, they had no emphasis on importing diversity and encouraging miscegenation. They just wanted to be left alone and keep away from their neighbors. </p>
<p>It struck me that tribal Europe must once has been like this.  Before the Roman Empire, perhaps even the Celtic invasion, each area must have had strikingly different localized populations.  Conquest, kingdoms, wars, and migrations largely eliminated that. </p>
<p>Nowadays, you can travel from Rome to Stockholm, and there is relatively little variation to see.  Still a  small bit, yes, but not all that much. Civilization produces uniformity.</p>
