<h1>Nigerian &#8216;Baby Factory&rsquo; Raided, 32 Teenage Girls Freed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, June 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nigerian police have raided a home allegedly being used to force teenage girls to have babies that were then offered for sale for trafficking or other purposes, authorities said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stormed the premises of the Cross Foundation in Aba three days ago following a report that pregnant girls aged between 15 and 17 are being made to make babies for the proprietor,&#8221; said Bala Hassan, police commissioner for Abia state in the country&rsquo;s southeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We rescued 32 pregnant girls and arrested the proprietor who is undergoing interrogation over allegations that he normally sells the babies to people who may use them for rituals or other purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the girls told police they had been offered to sell their babies for between 25,000 and 30,000 naira (192 dollars) depending on the sex of the baby.</p>
<p>The babies would then be sold to buyers for anything from 300,000 naira to one million naira (1,920 and 6,400 dollars) each, according to a state agency fighting human trafficking in Nigeria, the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).</p>
<p>The girls were expected to be transferred to the regional NAPTIP offices in Enugu on Wednesday, the regional head Ijeoma Okoronkwo told AFP.</p>
<p>Hassan said the owner of the &#8220;illegal baby factory&#8221; is likely to face child abuse and human trafficking charges. Buying or selling of babies is illegal in Nigeria and can carry a 14-year jail term.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so many cases going on in court right now,&#8221; said Okoronkwo.</p>
<p>In 2008, police raids revealed an alleged network of such clinics, dubbed baby &#8220;farms&#8221; or &#8220;factories&#8221; in the local press.</p>
<p>Cases of child abuse and people trafficking are common in West Africa. Some children are bought from their families to for use as labour in plantations, mines, factories or as domestic help.</p>
<p>Others are sold into prostitution while a few are either killed or tortured in black magic rituals. NAPTIP says it has also seen a trend of illegal adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a problem of illict adoption and people not knowing the right way to adopt children,&#8221; said Okoronkwo.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is ranked the third most common crime after economic fraud and drug trafficking in the country, according to UNESCO.<br>

		<p>I had a conversation with some liberals once.  They were all about &#8220;all cultures are equal&#8221; and all that.  Then I brought up how in some parts of Mexico, men buy young girls as wives with cases of beer.  A man in Texas from that region was arrested for ding that in the U.S.  I asked the liberals if that were right.  They suddenly became hypocrites to their own positions and said adamantly that if a custom is against American law, then it must be denied and fought against.  They didn&rsquo;t realize that by flooding the country with such &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; cultures, they were weakening the more advanced American values.</p>

		<p>Apparently some of the infants were sold to be used in &#8216;voodoo rituals&rsquo;.<br>
 We often read articles decrying the evil of the the trans Atlantic slave trade in olden times, but it is forgotten that slaves were purchased from this self same region and at a time when the horrors described in the article were everyday facts of life in west Africa.</p>

		<p>How much aid do we give Nigeria every year?</p>
<p>I know we gave them 270 million dollars to continue to not use condoms in the fight against AIDS (mind you, they have a real population growth of 3.2% per year and 126 million already so it&rsquo;s not like AIDS is winning&hellip;).</p>
<p>I guess the only thing that matters is that Nigeria supplies about 2.5 million barrels per day of U.S. oil requirements.  About 15% of our annual total, out of the Bay Of Guinea.  By 2015, this is expected to be 25% of our annual totals.</p>
<p>And as long as U.S. oil companies are terrorized by Nigerian bandits stealing roughly 40,000 barrels a day worth of profits, we will continue to pretend that the rest of that benighted country&rsquo;s problems are ours to own as well.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea of how little this means:  3.2% of 126,000,000 is 4.03 million kids per year.</p>
<p>In 2009, the United States had 4,136,000 births.</p>
<p>We have 3.79 million square miles of territory.  Nigeria has 356,000 square miles.</p>
<p>And we are in a dead heat to make more screaming mouths of Malthusian Outcome.</p>

        You are a race baiting simpleton based<br>
on your nonsensical statement. Fact: Since legalized<br>
abortion, the white population of the U.S. has<br>
dramatically been reduced and will by some estimates<br>
actually be a minority status by the year 2020.<br>
Please name me one article form anyone, from anywhere,<br>
stating for a fact that people were arrested in the U.S.<br>
that ran a white race baby mill such as the one<br>
in Nigeria. You can&rsquo;t and you won&rsquo;t be able to find<br>
any. Please crawl back under the rock from which<br>
you came.</p>

		<p>I hear the constant talk about the population increase, but I read one article after another regarding the effects of Genetically Modified Foods, or GMOs, that are Bioengineered to be a factor in sterilizing the people across the Country, and around the world. </p>
<p>I have read one such story on the website for Solutions from Science.com, which reported that GMO corn has been implanted with a spermicide for total population reduction. </p>
<p>Others from Natural News.com, Organic Bytes.com, Information Clearing House.com, BrasscheckTV.com, and Freedom Force International.com&rsquo;s &#8220;News from the Reality Zone&#8221; will enlighten more Readers about this stealth plan for depopulation. </p>
<p>Remember, White families eat this garbage GMO food, too, so the desired effects are happening to them, as well. </p>
<p>Buy your fruits and vegetables from a known producer, or grow your own. Avoid the hormones that are found in most milk, by buying brands that advertise that they get their milk from Natural, or Organic, Dairy Framers. Do the same with your meat purchases.</p>
<p>Your choices now may have long lasting results for your children, as to whether you become a grandparent, or great-grandparent. </p>

		<p>@14 Anon,</p>
<p>If there are fertility suppressants in food (see Codex Alimentarius for a good place to insert some), it certainly isn&rsquo;t showing up in the statistics which suggest that Africa will be the one continent where population grown -does not- level off after 2060 with numbers on the order of 2.7 billion and spiraling ever higher by 2100 (14.2 billion, world wide).</p>
<p>Nor do they show up in the Indian Sub Continent, where a landmass with roughly twice the area of Texas will have 3 billion souls living in it.</p>
<p>Why create such a huge population to begin with and then bring it here to wreck and replace our own, balanced, one (economic stresses being far more responsible for white lowered fertility than synthetic growth hormones) if the ultimate goal is to &#8216;save humanity&rsquo; by removing the highest growth segments of _THIRD WORLD_ cultures?</p>
<p>Zero Pop Growth is a myth that was foisted onto whites in the 1970s to convince our females to become liberated with one or fewer children.</p>
<p>It has never been a goal of the transnational globalists and were it to become so today, it would take nuclear war or runaway contagion to make a dent in the kinds of reproductive patterns now active throughout the &#8216;developing&rsquo; world.</p>
<p>Developing what, dare I ask?</p>

		<p>Anonymous 14- you must be kidding, and I&rsquo;m thinking less of Amren for even posting that comment.<br>
GMO produce has very real and very serious implications, as far as destroying nutritious strands.  This is a very real issue, as far as the future of agriculture.<br>
However, GMO plants cannot make humans sterile.  These are very simple facts of biology.  I think you should go look up some very simple biology texts- it is very basic that this sort of crossover is not possible.</p>
