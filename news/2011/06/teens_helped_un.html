			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Persichette, My Fox (New York), June 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Several children were spotted running around a Jersey City street on Wednesday. They were naked and hungry and their mother was nowhere in sight. Two teenage girls came to the rescue. </p>
<p>&#8220;They were running up and down the road- no clothes on,&#8221; said Nilaja Wyatt, 17. She decided to take control of the situation after her friend Aaliyah Glover said her mother almost ran over one of the kids. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teens gathered the six children and brought them inside. That&rsquo;s when they found out the kids&rsquo; 2-year-old brother was in the upstairs apartment all by himself. The door was locked, so they broke in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Chief Tom Comey said Francine Davis, 40, had left the children in the care of their oldest sibling, a 14-year-old autistic child. He said Davis had nothing to say when she turned herself in. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davis is facing six counts of endangering the welfare of a child. The children are now in foster care.</p>

		<p>  Why is this even a news story?  They don&rsquo;t supervise their offspring in the jungle of Afrique. Why do we think they would here in Amerika? </p>
<p>Wherever you find blacks behaving better than their jungle tendencies would allow, you will find a despairing train of suffering Whiteys who sacrificed too much so that blacks would act just White enough for somebody to say, &#8220;We&rsquo;ve done much, but we still have more work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>MLK spoke English. Was that his native afro-dialect?  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;d rather all we do is make the blacks homesick enough for the freedom and license of Afrique that they would be begging us in the name of life, liberty, and happiness that we immediately right a monstrous injustice and crime against global dignity by SENDING THEM ALL BACK HOME! Fill the boats!</p>
<p>Transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your nightmares, and you are extremely right&hellip;<br>

		<p>She&rsquo;s trying to practice &#8220;post-birth abortion&#8221; and failing miserably, even at that&hellip; Blacks don&rsquo;t invest as much love, care, teaching and attention on any particular one of their numerous offspring, because the best they can hope for is that one or two of them survive long enough to impregnate 3, 4 or more females before they are killed by fellow gang bangers or locked up for doing so. </p>

		<p>According to my arithmetic this forty year old woman has eight children. Most white women have a maternal instinct that prevents this kind of behavior. The problem with doing anything to preserve these children is that the instinct is preserved. Sometimes it is best to let nature take its course. <br>

There are too many people on this planet. Too many are the wrong kind of people. </p>

		<p>#8, that is precisely the problem, we are not letting nature run its course. Foods stamps, housing, welfare, medicare are the only reason there are eight kids. When it no longer becomes profitable but a burden the only family with eight kids will be the ones who really  want them and they will cherish them.</p>

		<p>The problem is that it doesn&rsquo;t take much to make a baby, but takes a whole lot more to support one. It is for this reason I cannot be unreservedly &#8220;pro-life,&#8221; or &#8220;anti-abortion.&#8221; Under the current circumstances, the need for population control is inevitable. There are simply too many people, most of them non-white who are historically least capable of supporting themselves.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of physical space. I suppose shoulder-to-shoulder we could fit a trillion or so of us on the planet. It really is a matter of the environment&rsquo;s capability to support us. Already the land is over farmed and the oceans overfished. Infrastructures are overtaxed and deteriorating, or are not present to any degree in many parts of the world. I could go on, but my point is it&rsquo;s already a rat&rsquo;s nest and we don&rsquo;t need more, especially not poor creatures such as these. God is alleged to have instructed &#8220;Go forth and multiply.&#8221; I think He would now say, &#8220;Oi vey, enough already!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Can anyone tell us how much this woman is costing us in direct and indirect welfare payments for these eight children? That includes medical, TANF, Section 8, SSI (at least one disabled child), education, free meals, free phone, free powere, counselling, other welfare and law enforcement services, etc? I&rsquo;ll wager she gets a public defender who wil end up getting &#8220;her&#8221; children&#8221; back to her. What are the life-time costs to taxpayers of what she has &#8220;produced?&#8221;  Back of the envelope, I put it at about $1M per child through the age of 21. Anyone have any different numbers?</p>
<p>In an era where people with middle class incomes are debating whether they can afford to have any children at all, what right does this woman have to demand that these same people pay the costs to raise &#8220;her&#8221; children? It isn&rsquo;t the fault of the men she had sex with. She was looking for sperm donors and if she could have used a turkey baster instead, she would have done it. These children are not &#8220;accidents&#8221; but a welfare business model that costs the American taxpayer over $800 Billion dollars a year in direct costs.</p>
<p>When are we going to demand that anyone who gets taxpayers dollars to raise their children must be on mandatory birth control and that any child over 1 will be removed for their own good.  We have to break the cycle. </p>

		<p>Her case reminds me of the one about 15 years ago, when 4 or 5 black sister broodmares were in one dwelling, and breeding like rats, they had over 20 children.It led to some welfare reform, but far from enough.This might wake up a few more people, and some more welfare reform might pass, but you can bet that it wont be enough.M, your post was excellent.</p>

		<p>It takes a village to raise a child; that&rsquo;s the African adage. It&rsquo;s been an aspect of America&rsquo;s African community ever since there has been an African community.</p>
<p>Western culture families traditionally consist of a father, mother and children. The father and mother assume responsibility for raising their children. </p>
<p>African families typically consists of males who engage in procreation with numerous females. The fathers are often absent and assume no responsibility for their offspring or caring for the women who bear them. The mothers turn their offspring loose in the &#8220;village&#8221; streets where they are raised by their peers. </p>
<p>Western culture is known for nuclear families. African culture is known for tribes; or &#8220;mobs&#8221;.</p>

<p><i>Can anyone tell us how much this woman is costing us in direct and indirect welfare payments for these eight children?</i> </p>
<p>Excellent question, and one that needs to be asked point blank to each and every politician seeking election or reelection.</p>
<p>According to the US Dept. of Agriculture:  <i>A Child Born In 2010 Will Cost $226,920 To Raise.</i> (although I believe this figure is too low).</p>
<p>Knowing how inefficient the government is about everything, I would extrapolate that the cost of &#8220;raising&#8221; a child on all of the entitlements you mentioned would be about double.</p>
<p>Chris Miller writes in <i>None Dare Call it White Genocide</i>:</p>
<p><i>Welfare and social benefit policies financially reward the generally poorer non-White groups for having large broods of children&hellip; The appalling aspect of these trends is that most of these policies, such as welfare, food stamps, and free emergency medical care, are predominantly financed by White American taxpayers&hellip;as the progressive income tax discourages the most productive White Americans from having children.</i></p>
<p><i>Educated, self-reliant, and law-abiding White American taxpayers face the greatest disincentives to having large families.  Instead, these White taxpayers work hard but are forced to financially support criminals, illegal aliens, and welfare abusers.  The taxes paid by hardworking White citizens are transferred to illiterate illegal aliens to bankroll large broods of anchor babies</i></p>
<p><i>The type of genocide White Americans face is far more subtle, which makes it all the more dangerous.</i></p>
<p>NPI reports:</p>
<p><i>America&rsquo;s White population shrank in 15 of the 50 states. California lost 5% of its whites;. The number of white children fell in 46 states, for an overall decrease of 10%.</i></p>

		<p>I am so sick of the commercial asking us to send money to help the starving children of Africa, all this as the PREGNANT mother of 12 sits in the corner and cries as the 8 year old son feeds his 6 young siblings.<br>
Maybe we need to send these American mothers to Africa to learn proper child care?</p>
<p>One nice thing though the pleas are ALWAYS for Africa where the blacks just think we are wonderful (sarcasm) and not being wasted on poor, deserving. Americans Right Here, they must have all of them taken care of already so they are just reaching out to those in distant lands?</p>
