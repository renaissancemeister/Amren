			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jackie Kucinich, USA Today, June 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican leaders have repeatedly stressed the need for their 2012 nominee to win the growing Hispanic vote, but most of the party&rsquo;s president contenders have no outreach focusing specifically on Hispanics.</p>
<p>More than 50 million Hispanics live in the USA, a 46% increase from the past decade, according to the 2010 U.S. Census.</p>
<p>Hispanics made up 6.9% of voters in last year&rsquo;s midterm elections, up from 5.8% in 2006, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Sixty percent of Hispanics voted for Democratic candidates, Pew records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanics backed Democrat Barack Obama over McCain, R-Ariz., by 67% to 31% in 2008, records show. Obama and his campaign organization have made moves to keep their support.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>None of the campaign websites for the major contenders has a Spanish-language version, only one appears to have staff dedicated to Hispanic outreach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two Republican candidates have made some early efforts to contact Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>Former House speaker Newt Gingrich long ago began establishing roots in the Hispanic community through his various businesses, including The Americano, a conservative Hispanic news site. He gave one of his first interviews after announcing his candidacy to Univision. Sylvia Garcia, Hispanic outreach director for the Gingrich campaign, will lead Gingrich&rsquo;s &#8220;Hispanic inclusion&#8221; effort that is likely to launch in the coming months.</p>
<p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty was the only 2012 contender to attend the Hispanic Leadership Network conference in Florida in January. The event, co-chaired by former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former Commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez, was sponsored by the Republican American Action Network.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jesse Benton, a spokesman for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, said Paul places a &#8220;high value&#8221; on Hispanic outreach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that Dr. Paul&rsquo;s message of personal liberty, strong families and vision for economic prosperity have a natural appeal to Hispanics and will make communicating to Latinos a priority for our team,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Sorry, Ron Paul must be smoking some of those drugs he wants to legalize.  The reason Republican Presidential candidates are &#8220;slow to reach Hispanic voters&#8221; is that in a rare fit of intelligence, they&rsquo;re not doing very much of it.  Because (at least temporarily) they have figured out either that they won&rsquo;t get the majority of the Hispanic vote, but because the 2012 Republican will very likely fare better versus Obama than the 2008 Republican nominee in general and especially among (real) white voters, the 2012 Republican will automatically get more than 31% of the Hispanic vote.  But that &#8220;strong Republican&#8221; bump will be all that it can get.</p>
<p>Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said it best when asked what Hispanic voters really wanted from the political process   &mdash;   &#8220;Fully funded welfare programs.&#8221;</p>

<p>What garbage! Doesn&rsquo;t surprise me about Ron Paul..He is also a MLK fan! These Republicans lost me a long time ago. They are not worth a plugged nickle. Paul&rsquo;s assertion that &#8220;hispanics&#8221; have <br>
&#8220;strong family values&#8221; (sound familiar, aka, GW Bush) they love personal liberty, and any kind of vision, let alone economic, is ridiculous. They love welfare and Whitey paying for it, period.</p>

		<p>If the GOP is against amnesty then they can&rsquo;t go wrong. Enough Latinos vote GOP anyway. Whites won&rsquo;t vote for a racialist party so Western nationalists need to model themselves on E.European mainstream nationalist parties that don&rsquo;t exclude or pander to minorities rather than on Nazis/Fascists. The GOP fears White voters&rsquo; lukewarm attitude to White survival more than the minorities&rsquo; potential to overwhelm this new post-Bush TeaParty GOP but Newt is a bad choice for leader based on his record.</p>

		<p>While I doubt that Hispanics will go overwhelmingly for Republicans anytime soon, I do suspect that a goodly number of them would respond positively enough to Republican overtures to make such an effort worthwhile.  Blacks, unfortunately, aren&rsquo;t worth the time or effort, and those few inclined to the Republican message are already with them.  Ironically, some of the most visible conservative supporters are black, guys like Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell, and most recently, Herman Cain. Unfortunately, the majority are hopelessly mired in four decades of practicing victimhood..  I&rsquo;d more than happy to be proved wrong, but so far I see little evidence that this will change.</p>

		<p>Would someone please explain to me the idea of the so-called impact of Hispanic voters. Truth be told, the vast numbers of hispanics in this nation, are here illegally and can&rsquo;t vote. Even those here legally, are not known to be big on voting. I just don&rsquo;t get it. </p>

		<p>Most of us who were born in the United States want to restrict immigration. For every Hispanic vote a candidate gets the candidate loses four white votes and one black vote. Republican candidates understand that better than Democratic candidates. </p>

<p><b>The myth of Hispanic family values has been busted </b>on this website, referring to an article from the Economist. Roughly half of the Mexican kids today are in broken families   &mdash;   down slightly from the African(-American) percentage of 66% who have no idea who their daddy is. </p>

		<p>Has anyone noticed that Hispanics have become the &#8220;chosen people?&#8221; Their votes are favored, their nationality revered, their presence here, even if illegally, welcomed. Has anyone asked for the American vote lately? If so, I haven&rsquo;t heard. I will not vote for any of the present candidates. I&rsquo;m waiting for someone to come along that has the courage to say, &#8220;I am going to put Americans first. We will start with closing the border, eliminating jobs and benefits for illegals and fix the misinterpreted 14th amendment. Is that clear?&#8221; Golly, what a dream! Sounds like the US of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Illegal aliens &#8220;can&rsquo;t&#8221; vote, but at least 3 million of them did in the 2000 Presidential elections.  What do you think motor-voter is about?  Now extended to welfare-voter.  Even if it weren&rsquo;t for that, the white liberals and Hispanics who run canvassing boards in a place like Los Angeles County aren&rsquo;t going to turn away an illegal alien who wants to register to vote.  The U.S. Attorney sure as heck won&rsquo;t do anything about it, because he or she works for an open borders Republocrat.</p>
<p>Even with all that, the national average is that if you lose 9 Hispanic votes, all you need is to gain one White vote to be back to par.  That ratio varies by state, obviously it will be lower in CA, AZ, NM, TX and higher in VT, ND, WV.</p>

<p>Supporting my last point, look at this late breaking news from New Mexico:</p>
<p>https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/64000-cases-possible-voter-fraud-being-i</p>
<p>Now, this did not preclude a number of important blue-to-red flips in the state, including one of three House districts, the Governor&rsquo;s chair, and most importantly, for the sake of this story, the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office.  However, most everything else, Democrats won, and they won them by relatively small margins.</p>

		<p>White GOP is, once again, not getting it!  Blacks and hispanics and other nonwhites hate whites and hate conservative values, therefore, they won&rsquo;t vote for conservatives in large numbers.  Nothing the GOP does or say will change that.  When are they going to get it?</p>
