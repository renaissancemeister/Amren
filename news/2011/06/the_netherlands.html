<h1><a href="https://www.hudson-ny.org/2219/netherlands-abandons-multiculturalism">The Netherlands to Abandon Multiculturalism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Soeren Kern, Hudson New York, June 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Dutch government says it will abandon the long-standing model of multiculturalism that has encouraged Muslim immigrants to create a parallel society within the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A new integration bill (covering letter and 15-page action plan), which Dutch Interior Minister Piet Hein Donner presented to parliament on June 16, reads: &#8220;The government shares the social dissatisfaction over the multicultural society model and plans to shift priority to the values of the Dutch people. In the new integration system, the values of the Dutch society play a central role. With this change, the government steps away from the model of a multicultural society.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter continues: &#8220;A more obligatory integration is justified because the government also demands that from its own citizens. It is necessary because otherwise the society gradually grows apart and eventually no one feels at home anymore in the Netherlands. The integration will not be tailored to different groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new integration policy will place more demands on immigrants. For example, immigrants will be required to learn the Dutch language, and the government will take a tougher approach to immigrants to ignore Dutch values or disobey Dutch law.</p>
<p>The government will also stop offering special subsidies for Muslim immigrants because, according to Donner, &#8220;it is not the government&rsquo;s job to integrate immigrants.&#8221; The government will introduce new legislation that outlaws forced marriages and will also impose tougher measures against Muslim immigrants who lower their chances of employment by the way they dress. More specifically, the government will impose a ban on face-covering Islamic burqas as of January 1, 2013.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The measures are being imposed by the new center-right government of Conservatives (VVD) and Christian Democrats (CDA), with parliamentary support from the anti-Islam Freedom Party (PVV), whose leader, Geert Wilders, is currently on trial in Amsterdam for &#8220;inciting hatred&#8221; against Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But polls show that a majority of Dutch voters support the government&rsquo;s skepticism about multiculturalism. According to a Maurice de Hond poll published by the center-right newspaper Trouw on June 19, 74 percent of Dutch voters say immigrants should conform to Dutch values. Moreover, 83 percent of those polled support a ban on burqas in public spaces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for Interior Minister Donner, he has undergone a late-in-life conversion on the issue of Muslim immigration. In September 2006, while serving as justice minister, Donner provoked an outcry after saying that he welcomed the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the Netherlands if the majority wants it. He also said Holland should give Muslims more freedoms to behave according to their traditions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2011 and Donner now says his government &#8220;will distance itself from the relativism contained in the model of a multicultural society.&#8221; Although society changes, he says, it must not be &#8220;interchangeable with any other form of society.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Good news indeed. </p>
<p>How long do you think it will be before governments get REALLY smart and pass laws and tax codes encouraging whites and other productive peoples to have children again?  At the same time pass laws discouraging the drags on society to stop having kids.  </p>
<p>Will that happen before it is too late?    <br>

		<p>This is a good step and I hope that Britain and all other concerned countries in the EU will take notice and follow suit. Since Dutch is so difficult to learn, it is unlikely that very many new immigrants will be admitted.  More national tests are needed however, to keep non-white non-Euros out of Europe.  This is a matter of survival for real Europe, and has little to do with actual racism, unless wishing to see your race survive is racism and wrong.</p>

<i>&hellip;encouraged Muslim immigrants to create a parallel society within the Netherlands.</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not asking or forcing them to leave. They&rsquo;re only asking them to create a &#8216;parallel society&rsquo; within the Netherlands.</p>
<p>This is far from the best solution. However, WHEN push comes to shove, the fact that they are not integrated may make it easier to get these people to leave. </p>

		<p>This new policy does no good. The problem is not that Muslims and blacks are failing to integrate in the Netherlands and Europe   &mdash;   the problem is that they are in there in the first place.</p>

		<p>A wonderful followup to the Geert Wilders acquittal.</p>
<p>Better late than never. Looks like some of the &#8216;pod people&rsquo; (ref. Invasion of the Body Snatchers) have started to revert to human status.</p>
<p>Look for U.S. State Dept. to express &#8216;concern&rsquo;. Over the weekend I read about US ambassador to Finland giving an interview in Finland disparaging the True Finns and likening them to the Tea Partiers and urging continued consumption of Diversity/NationBreaking Kool-Aid.</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/pVd4U</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the True Finns as well as the U.S. Tea Party represent people who have anxiety about changes. They are looking back to the past, when everything was simpler. It is understandable, but one can not return to the past. Isolation from the rest of the world and the closure of borders would be a bad thing to Finland as well as for the world at large, Oreck said to the Hufvudstadsbladet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note this Ambassador is named Oreck and is the son of the vacuum cleaner Oreck and looks like Mr. Clean. So the father Oreck is an admirably successful entrepeneur and the son is a mush-headed PC MC hack.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, &#8216;simpler&rsquo; and a lot better. But alas the notion of nation-states having a homogeneous and cohesive culture and identity is just not on any more and would be &#8216;a bad thing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Get with the program you silly Finns - whose students achieve at the highest levels in Europe because diversity is still not widespread there.</p>

		<p>Racial integration is much worse than multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism allows for self-segregation, which white nationalism agrees with. </p>
<p>Integration is about taking all men, stripping away their national racial identities, and forging them into hybrid, raceless &#8216;consumer units&rsquo; for a new world order based on the primacy of trade relationships.</p>
<p>The brown underclass welcomes all.  Under policies of racial integration, Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands would look identical to Brazil or Cuba.</p>

<p>Unless most Dutch people just dislike Geert Wilders no matter what he says, it seems odd the their nationalist pendulum should so suddenly swing the other way.</p>
<p>To be able to say that immigrants should conform to the values of the nation to which they immigrated would get an American branded as a racist. Even if a poll in the US is totally anonymous, many Americans would simply go with the status quo rather than with their &#8220;gut&#8221; feeling because they couldn&rsquo;t live with the guilt. </p>

		<p>Hello! Is anybody in the white house reading this, or at least paying any attention to. If this makes to much sense to our elected idiots, then they should at least let the people go back to choosing what color or race of people they want to live around and raise their children around. before anyone cries racist, let me explain. White people have lost(given)their rights away. They are used as a scapegoat for every minority&rsquo;s problems. black and hispanics murder, rape, beat, White&rsquo;s  when they have them outnumbered, and it&rsquo;s not a problem, because chances are the White victim will be charged with a hate crime! Let people be with their own kind if that is how they wish to live.</p>

		<p>This may be a random comment, but as a a first generation American of European decent, i applaud the fact they would reject me as a countryman without certain stipulations. I know why they want a homogeneous society, and I&rsquo;m willing to accept that.  I&rsquo;m an American White guy.  While they would appreciate me slightly more than, say, a broke Pakistani, I&rsquo;m in the same category: If you cannot contribute positively to our society and seamlessly blend in - we don&rsquo;t want you here.  A very simple way I look at things is &#8220;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&#8221;  The dutch people are just fine the way they are.  I&rsquo;m sure their people don&rsquo;t say &#8220;You know, we could use 100,000 more Mexicans this year!  Better yet, get some Guatemalans here ASAP.&#8221;<br>
No, they left that to Ted Kennedy.</p>

		<p>As an American living in The Netherlands for the last 10 years I have witnessed (and experienced) these changes first hand.  As inferred in the original article, the murder of Pym Fortijn here was ELECTRIFYING!  With his death the scales of political correctness were finally removed from the Dutch eyes.  And it was the rejection of political correctness in the national dialog that allowed these changes to take place.  </p>
<p>If you cannot talk openly and honestly about issues then solutions can never be found.  In Pym&rsquo;s case he shocked the establishment when he asked &#8220;Why do all the Moroccan street criminals (muggers/robbers) target white Dutchmen and never fellow Moroccans?&#8221;  Defenders of evil political correctnes were apoplectic, whining &#8220;you can&rsquo;t say that&#8221; &#8220;that&rsquo;s racist&#8221; and so on.  He did not back down and apologize, rather he pointed out the crime stats that proved his point.  I&rsquo;ve learned that political correctness is by nature very fragile; built like a house of cards.  All it take for it to come tumbling down are a couple of leaders to directly challenge it.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that multiculturalism and marxist cultural relativity can be beaten back.  The key to success is to reject political correctness.  Political correctness is the gag that prevents open dialog.</p>

		<p>I urge my fellow white racial realists in the AR community to notice that word games are being played here, as well as throughout most of the other major European nations who&rsquo;ve suddenly and deviously decided to announce that &#8216;multi-culturalism&rsquo; is a failure.  </p>
<p>The problem, the real problem - which every committed AR reader fully understands - is multi-racialism.  History clearly shows, and as Jared Taylor has continually pointed out during many of his speeches and talks - that the ONLY possible way for a multi-racial society to function at all, is for the dominant founding demographic group, in our case, White Europeans - to fiercely defend, preserve and maintain at all costs - their numerical superiority and their percentage of the total population of their nation should never drop below 90%.   The non-white groups, COMBINED, should be rigorously restricted to not exceed the remaining 10 percent.   And, any non-white who utters a peek of complaint about this policy can be immediately deported back to the non-white nation of their ancestry where they can happily rejoin their racial kinsmen - and let us make danged sure that the door doesn&rsquo;t hit them on their fanny on the way out.  </p>
<p>This was the old model, and as long as whites were at 90% and the non-whites kept to around 10%, pressure to assimilate to the majority&rsquo;s culture, values, traditions and customs was overwhelming - and the numerical advantage held by whites served to guarantee the preservation of White, Western European civilization and all of it&rsquo;s sacred tenets, things such as individual liberty, strictly limited, Constitutionally restricted government, social cohesion, and a strict adherence to the rule of law.  These same principles apply to all European dominant nations, or used to - before the global-wide white genocide criminal conspirators were turned loose in the Mid-1960s.    This model, now that whites are reduced to about 66% of our nation&rsquo;s population - can obviously no longer work, as our enemies have managed to guilt-trip our people into allowing massive waves of incompatible, indigestible, non-assimilable non-white aliens to flood into our nation.   Thus, in America&rsquo;s case - our cowardice on defending our legitimate racial specific interests is likely to result in the breakup of the existing USA and the formation of ethno-states.  </p>
<p>Over the last year, primarily due to the rapid and long-overdue rise of White European Nationalist parties - these criminal ruling elites are getting nervous, because white people are deciding that they do not want to be genocided and have their nations destroyed by the influx of indigestible, incompatible, often violent prone non-whites - most of whom arrive with a huge chip on their shoulders and immediately start issuing demands for financial handouts and for affirmative action advantages and who very quickly learn the game of screaming &#8216;racist&rsquo; at any White European who refuses to concede to their endless demands.</p>
<p>So, now  these elites are playing word games with their populations.   Proclaiming that multi-culturalism is dead as an official government policy is not the same as admitting that multi-racialism is equivalent to white racial, ethnic and cultural genocide. </p>
<p>Multi-racialism is the problem.   We must address this issue head-on, and not be fooled by word-game playing politicians - who have still not abandoned their plans for white genocide.</p>
<p>This principle applies most especially to America.  When politicians who pretend to represent the majority of White Americans (Rs) openly pander to Hispanics and advocate amnesty and a pathway to citizenship - these politicians are advocating a continuation of the White Genocide program that was launched in 1965.    The same thing applies to any of these treasonous Church leaders.  </p>
<p>Learn to identify who our enemies are, fellow White racial realists.    Do not support the enemies of our race.    And, make sure you tell them why they lost your support.</p>
<p>Be white, be proud, and be vocal.   Whites have every moral, legal, and justified right to survive as a distinct people. We<br>
have legitimate ethnic-specific interests and we will NOT allow our enemies to deny us our right to pursue those interests.</p>

		<p>Parallel societies are well established and connected to the immigrants&rsquo; countries of origin now. The call for more integration will not affect them but only those alien who choose to be integrated, and the European which will not have such a choice. Because of this dissimilarity, soon, it is the white, while even more of his traditional freedom will be taken away from him, which will need to adapt to others. Integration may arm him even more than multiculturalism, and is at least in principle the most contrary to self determination: the path of his liberation. Again, Islam is a symptom and not a disease: Wilder&rsquo;s judge said that he has the right to criticize Islam, but that he was close to commit discrimination against a group when he asked for closing the border for non western; that is at least what I have just read.</p>

		<p>Blacks are even worse than Muslims because they emerged much more recently from the stone age. Everywhere blacks go they carry with the savagery of the African jungle. <br>

We are unfortunately stuck with the blacks whose ancestors were brought here as slaves, but there is no reason for any civilized nation to allow black immigration. </p>

		<p>As for Interior Minister Donner, he has undergone a late-in-life conversion on the issue of Muslim immigration. In September 2006, while serving as justice minister, Donner provoked an outcry after saying that he welcomed the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the Netherlands if the majority wants it. He also said Holland should give Muslims more freedoms to behave according to their traditions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2011 and Donner now says his government &ldquo;will distance itself from the relativism contained in the model of a multicultural society.&rdquo; Although society changes, he says, it must not be &ldquo;interchangeable with any other form of society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I think this speaks to the sincerity of some of the politicians behind this.</p>
<p>Race replacement is the real issue anyway and cultural assimilation does not address it directly.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if they would only embrace the Christian nature of the Dutch Calvinist culture, that WOULD be something! But instead, they will adopt the EU &lsquo;gays/atheists/abortion-choosers&rsquo; are ok with us&rsquo; mentality, and pretend one can fight Islam with a moral vacuum&hellip;.</p>
<p>But at least they are acknowledging that Holland is Caucasoid, and European!</p>
<p>Well, at least Western&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I lived in The Netherlands for a while and in Europe longer.  Dutch liberalism is the result of the Calvinist culture you note and has long been rejected.  I&rsquo;ve been at Christmas parties there that resemble pre-Christian practices more than even they realized.  It was gratifying to see that some Europeans still remember their real past cultures after all the centuries of repression. Most Dutch and Northern Europeans are simply fed up with the dour, sour, minimalism of Protestantism.  </p>
<p>What the average conservative American doesn&rsquo;t realize is that Europe has a different history.  They are very aware of the suffering and wars that Christianity brought to them, while we are the descendants of a branch of Christianity that either created a false exclusivity (Calvinism), or a stark, unhappy form of personal strictures (Puritanism), neither of which have actual scriptural support.  They are more the result of political competitions of that time that necessarily involved Christianity because the separation of church and state hadn&rsquo;t even been established, only dreamt about.  Our cultural religious histories diverge in the 17 century, during the English Civil War and the Thirty Years War on the continent.  All of that was religious civil war.  The idea that the Dutch or any European culture will revert to those ways of thinking is hopeless, and that is good.</p>
<p>It ought to be remembered that philosophy is a greater, and older Western tradition and that agnosticism and atheism are very old philosophical ideas and debates.  They are the points where higher achieving thought, science and technological advance have their roots.  To reject them is to limit and deny the full and most important qualities of Western culture and civilization. To claim that atheists for example represent a morally devoid set of ideas is not only false, but flies in the face of its &#8220;raison d&rsquo;etre.&#8221;  Anyone who thinks that ethics and morality is not part of philosophical discussion is not only kidding himself, but reveals complete ignorance of the subject of ethics and morals.  There are many philosophical works on ethics and morals in the realm of philosophical academia that contain many famous names going back to ancient Greece, but coming up to modern times.  The achievement of Western Philosophy represents the zenith of human conscious thought.</p>
<p>The Dutch and all Europeans, all whites for that matter would do best in throwing off the problematic hypocrisies that religion always brings with it and establish their spirituality with their land and their ancestors.  Ancestor worship has worked very well for the Japanese and used to work in Europe.  A kind of movement is afoot as exhibited by the increase of whites in genealogy.  That would be progress rather than regression into failed formulas of religious dogma that can&rsquo;t help but oppress the very people they hope to control.  That has always resulted in rejection and even revolution.  But a conscious reverence of ancestors and an increase in their value to us is what is needed.  </p>

<p>It seems to me that this is nothing but a chameleon politician who has sensed a change in the winds and is now shifting his sails to accommodate it (and extend his career).</p>
<p>I read many of the enthusiastic posts above with a  large dollop of scepticism. Unlike some, I am not too teary-eyed to  type my doubts. After all, 2013 is still a long way off. A lot can happen by then.  We shall see.</p>
<p>However, some of the posts were on the mark: particularly #10,anonymous [&#8220;Racial integration is much worse than multiculturalism.  Integration is about taking all men, stripping away their national, racial identities, and forging them into hybrid, raceless &lsquo;consumer units&rsquo; for a new world order based on the primacy of trade relationships.&#8221;]&hellip; and #20 by Luke  [&#8220;now these elites are playing word games with their populations.  Multi-racialism is the problem!  We must address this issue head-on, and not be fooled by word-game-playing politicians,  who still have not abandoned their plans for white genocide.&#8221;]</p>

		<p>Over the weekend, I attended two parties, where all the guests were White. Everyone at these parties were all talking about the same things that are discussed here, and everyone is fed up. We all enjoyed the parties, however, and of course, there were no shootings or stabbings for the News to report, either. </p>
<p>I had to seize the opportunity by talking about all the issues, while giving out the web sites for AmRen and the Council of Conservative Citizens. </p>
<p>I will never let an opportunity go by without informing those who are speaking the same political language to become more informed about the real issues that face this country. </p>

		<p>What is needed is a REPATRIATION program. A generous <br>
stipend cold be awarded that would allow every muslim <br>
family to return home with enough money to start a business.<br>
Say the total welfare payments of 7 years given in a lump sum.<br>
Those that accept would agree to renounce all claims of <br>
return to Holland. Those who stay would be told that<br>
welfare of all kinds was being phased out. The time for them<br>

		<p>Some of you need to read a little closer. They&rsquo;re regretting, not encouraging, the parallel society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that this is a somewhat weak beginning, but For a high official in any western govt to say these things and actually announce abandonment of multicult is about the farthest I think any of them have gone yet. Merkel, the Brits et al have only admitted the failure and gone back to what they were doing, having made their one truthful statement for the year. Sarkozy has apparently thrown gypsies out of France, and that&rsquo;s pleasantly shocking too, but that was the end of his sudden sanity too. </p>
<p>Anything can happen the way things are going. Fortunately, whites are still the majority in many of our countries, if often not by much. Since Muslim countries are coming up in the world, maybe some of Europe&rsquo;s browns will re-evaluate on which side of the fence the grass is greener. </p>

		<p>This is fantastic! Now all they have to do is to boot out all the foreigners. With the way Muslims are however, they won&rsquo;t accept this assimilation of their way of life. Sharia law is what democratic republics are to the west, they go hand in hand and all those millions of Muslims in Europe won&rsquo;t tolerate suddenly being told that they have to assimilate. </p>
<p>I forsee tensions getting even worse, and Muslim attacks and protests getting more violent, especially if all European countries adopt these policies.</p>
<p>The only way forward from here is to kick them out.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pray for a ulta-conservative House in Senate in 2012!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another brainwashed Rush Limbaugh fan. Lets think, since the eighties more and more White have embraced CONservatism. Yet all they have done is pass Amnesty, spend us into bankruptcy, vote almost 100% for things like NAFTA. Also most of them are just shills for big multinational corporations who off-shored all our jobs. If that is currently what Whites are hanging their hat on as hope in the U.S we have already lost. By the way the U.K was the most CONservative governemnts in Europe and they are the most pathetic. The danes, the Dutch, are the most socialist yet are the ones organizing. I just guess it means we Whites have half of our own population under a 100 IQ seeing as that is the median. Those are the idiots following these conservative frauds. Do not believe me look at the counties where the CONS have the highest votes they aRE low iq AREAS OF wHITES. GOD HELP US!When will you Whites learn that the so called Conservatives are not just enemies of the White race, they are our greatest enemies. Because they masqurade as our friends.</p>

<p>Your comment was full of good red meat until you hit this part:</p>
<p><i>Do not believe me look at the counties where the CONS have the highest votes they aRE low iq AREAS OF wHITES</i></p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not what that study says.  It claims that Republican counties are lower IQ counties.  Look at a little closer and you&rsquo;ll find out why   &mdash;   In many &#8220;red&#8221; counties in the Deep South, that are circa 60% white and 40% black, the whites vote Republican NOT because they&rsquo;re for Republicans, but only as a visceral reaction to the blacks voting Democrat.  Therefore, the whites&rsquo; &#8220;Republican&#8221; vote can be best understood as voting against blacks.  Therefore, the &#8220;county&#8221; will be Republican, but it will also be a low IQ county on average because of the blacks.</p>
<p>Rhetorical question for you:  Why isn&rsquo;t Cambridge, Massachusetts or Berkeley, California on the cutting edge of white nationalist and racial realist politics, if high IQ and support for economic socialism was the way to beget a WN/RR political culture?</p>
<p>As for the rest of your contentions, I don&rsquo;t happen to think what is going on in Denmark or The Netherlands or the United States vis-a-vis race organization has anything to do with those countries&rsquo; economic policies.  It is because Denmark and The Netherlands have political cultures which reward multiple parties, we do not.</p>
<p>I agree with you about Thatcher and the lamestream &#8220;conservatives&#8221; in Britain.  They&rsquo;re even more useless and liberal than our Republican Party.  </p>
