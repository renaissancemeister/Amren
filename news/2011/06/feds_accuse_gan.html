<h1>Feds Accuse Gang of Targeting Blacks in Calif City</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Risling, San Francisco Chronicle, June 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Latino gang conspired to rid a Southern California city of its black residents through intimidation, threats and violence dating back to the early 1990s to exert its influence and show its loyalty to the Mexican Mafia prison gang, according to a federal racketeering indictment unsealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>More than 50 people were charged as authorities made early morning raids targeting the Varrio Azusa 13 gang. Federal prosecutors said the gang engaged in a host of crimes ranging from drug trafficking to hate crimes that have hobbled Azusa, a city of about 45,000 residents near Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The crackdown is the latest effort by law enforcement to cripple Latino gangs that have targeted blacks in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>In 2009, more than 140 members and associates of the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang were charged in connection with waging a racist campaign against black people. Four years ago, authorities arrested dozens of members of South Los Angeles&rsquo; Florencia 13 gang in connection with the killing of blacks because of the color of their skin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Azusa, six people have been charged with civil rights violations for allegedly harassing, and in some cases attacking, African Americans to drive them out of the city or to prevent them from relocating there. Most of the defendants named in the indictment face a minimum 10-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of Azusa is Hispanic, while roughly 3 percent is black. The city has tried to address the racial problem after the number of hate crimes peaked at 17 in 2000 then dropped to about one a year since 2006, said Azusa Police Chief Robert Garcia.</p>

<p>The statistics say it all! Despite their intellectual and academic shortfalls, Blacks CAN be taught! Communication is in the language of the listener. The mestizos &#8216;splained it to them.  </p>

		<p>Lee Baca, LA County Sheriff, tells it like it is.  Baca admits they have a race war on their hands.  The white weenies mouth politically correct platitudes and deny the truth, thinking they&rsquo;re being &#8220;tolerant&#8221; by denying the facts.</p>
<p>Blacks fight with every group throughout the country, not just Hispanics and whites.  Asians, Indians, Middle Easterners all try to avoid blacks whenever and wherever they can, because they know full well what the real world is all about.</p>
<p>How long are the white liars going to be able to deny what is right in front of all eyes, but theirs? </p>

		<p>Blacks are not being targeted or killed because of the color of their skin. If that were true, the hispanics would be killing their dark-skinned relatives or perhaps dark skinned Asians or east Indians.</p>
<p>They are killing them because of who they are, what they do and to eliminate any competition or threats.</p>
<p>Same reasons warring tribes have killed each other for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

		<p>I can almost picture the liberal hand-wringing over these two protected minorities fighting with each other. Anyone who lives in CA can tell you blacks and mexicans are in the midst of a full scale turf war over CA. The diversity utopia is not just a dream, but a serious nightmare!

		<p>What a dilemma, two politically correct minorities who cannot get along, who do you support and who do you punish? In a few years, once most of the whites have bailed out of California and there is an all out war between the blacks and Hispanics, who is going to go in and quell that one?  </p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that this federal case will signal the end of this racist behavior and will help vindicate all of the victims who have suffered over the years, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andre, we&rsquo;re not holding our breath until Whites can return to the cities they built over 100 years ago. <br/>

		<p>Even Hispanics know that if there are blacks, especially low-class blacks, in town   &mdash;   the crime rates will skyrocket, property won&rsquo;t be cared for, and families won&rsquo;t be safe partying on their own front lawns.  They don&rsquo;t want any blacks in their territory!  And believe me, Azusa IS their territory; it&rsquo;s about as Mexican as it&rsquo;s possible to get.  However, I&rsquo;ll take a barrio over a ghetto any day, any way.  At least they have a Tex-Mex restaurant in Azusa that is the best in all of L.A.!!</p>

		<p>I would rather live with Hispanics than blacks. Hispanics are doing what whites should be doing. They are protecting their neighborhoods. <br/>
 <br/>
This makes me think of the last years of the Roman Empire, when the Roman Army was full of barbarian mercenaries. Indigenous inhabitants of the Empire no longer had the courage to defend themselves from barbarians, so they had to hire other barbarians to do it. </p>

		<p>Blacks (obama) run the federal govt now, so I can see why the feds are in there. Blacks take care of their own   &mdash;   even with non-black tax dollars. Personally I agree with comment 10 - rather live in a burro than a ghetto. </p>
<p>Mexicans, even though they are trouble with all their activities are not near as bad as blacks. </p>
<p>As they roust them out of their neighborhoods, guess whites can expect more blacks moving into theirs. Hell, can you imagine if whites were pushing blacks out of town!!! Be total federal takeover with hell and jail to pay. </p>
<p>Hey, eventually it might be better to move in a predominately hispanic town since blacks shy away from &#8216;em. Just a thought.   </p>

		<p>The contempt many Hispanics feel toward Blacks is perhaps the worst kept secret in modern PC &#8220;Diversity-land!&#8221; I have an acquaintance from Honduras who is in no way shy about sharing with me how much he and his people &#8220;back home&#8221; despise Blacks - wherever they may find them! One has to admit, the irony here is as breathtaking as it is, in a twisted sort of way, altogether comical.   </p>

		<p>Sorry, just can&rsquo;t feel any sympathy for blacks.  They have been doing the same thing to us, they have moved into white neighborhoods and cities and turned them into hellholes, they cheer whites getting displaced and attack us&hellip;yet they want us to feel sorry for them when the tables are turned?

		<p>It&rsquo;s wrong to take the Hispanics&rsquo; side in this, simply because they are beating up blacks.</p>
<p>I am not fond of either group but what you are seeing here is racial difference in methods and motives leading to directly contrastable outcomes.</p>
<p>A black _does not_ try to kick a white out of &#8216;his&rsquo; neighborhood.  He is dependent on that white for his ability to bring in decent stores, restaurants and public infrastructure with the power of his wallet and suffers enormously when the white refuses to share his company in disgust or fear of being robbed/raped/murdered.  Blacks track whites, following them like lions after a herd of wildebeeste.  Hispanics don&rsquo;t.  They come in, colonize and exclusively dominate a community.</p>
<p>In their dependency Blacks have also, to an extent, been rendered less &#8216;militant&rsquo; in their racial politics by their very successes in getting Whites to submit to their demands.</p>
<p>Hispanics see less tolerance from whites because Hispanics are coming in at the end of a long period of useless appeasement of blacks and bringing with them a culture of population replacement as superior TFRs.</p>
<p>And the DANGER is that Hispanics are succeeding to the point that they _don&rsquo;t need handouts_ to achieve that replacement in place.  Their solidarity and ruthlessness in wiping out threats to their culture lets them bring more racially unified (i.e. indoctrinated and grateful) kids to maturity.</p>
<p>Thanks to a plethora of innate bad habits related to low K-breeding strategies and extreme self indulgence, Blacks while their total population has grown, remain at 13% of our society.  </p>
<p>Hispanics, within this century will be 50-60% of our societal makeup from a starting point of less than 8%.  And once they have achieved this dominant majority population, they will exclude us from their company and social positions with the same political racist determinism as they now employ, physically, on blacks.</p>
<p>As proof, the only thing you need to recognize from this article is that Hispanics didn&rsquo;t start being arrested for &#8216;racial hate crimes&rsquo; until AFTER it was too late to save black communities from being replaced in place.</p>

<p>White &#8216;rugged individualists&rsquo; take heed, you heard it here first:  Hispanics are more dangerous to whites than blacks ever will be because they are more focused, less vocal and better organized towards a long term goal of total dominion by exclusion which would get a white labelled &#8216;racist&rsquo; in  heartbeat.</p>

		<p>On one level, this battle   &mdash;   &#8220;Alien vs. Predator&#8221;   &mdash;   warms my heart.  The blacks are getting a taste of what they&rsquo;ve been doing to us all these years.  On another level, this is bad because Hispanics won&rsquo;t accept us on their turf either.  Plus, to where do you think all those displaced blacks will move?  If you guessed white neighborhoods, go to the head of the class. </p>

		<p>The only reason the feds are doing anything about this gang activity is that the victims are blacks, and hispanic perps are usually classified as white. Big brother would rather see blacks and hispanics in unity destroying the white people but since these hispanics are not going along with the &#8220;universal diver$ity&#8221; plans, they are arrested. Re-education will follow. </p>

		<p>I also believe that living around Hispanics is not bad as blacks. Not even close. Arabs and Indians usually have 15 people in a house but typically non-violent. Indians assimilate much better than most foreigners. Mexican gangbangers are only a problem when they attck Whites &amp; Asians. If they go after black troublemakers I just don&rsquo;t care. My heart bleeds for White victims, some for Asian &amp; S.American, not a lot at all for black criminals and Muslim troublemakers of any color. If you can&rsquo;t accept that other people have a different god or no god in this country, other than Allah, then you got to go. </p>

Nobody wants to talk about the fact that the astronomical increase in the Hispanic population is a direct result of the illegal invasion in full swing.</p>
<p>Mexico is a fiercely nationalistic country, with little tolerance for outsiders not of the Mexican nationality. The Mexican constitution creates a two- tired society and excludes non-Mexicans from equal participation in that society. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this racial superiority belief does not stop at the Rio Grande. The result is an invasion made up of largely ignorant mestizos, with an attitude driven by bravado and a sense of misguided pride. These mestizos hate blacks as well as whites. In fact they hate anyone who does not share their La Raza.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever want to have to choose between blacks or Mexicans because I don&rsquo;t like either of them. Both are a losing proposition in so far as our glorious white race is concerned. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned Mexicans are no better than blacks…. <br/>

		<p>What comes around goes around.   I&rsquo;ll bet when mexicans first started moving into that city, the blacks made their lives miserable.  The mexicans probably organized themselves for defensive purposes at first, and, after awhile, the effort evolved into an aggressive effort to boot the blacks out altogether.   This is pretty much how blacks have taken over white neighborhoods in the past. </p>
