<h1><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57013.html">Bloomberg: U.S. Immigration Policy Is &#8216;National Suicide&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Epstein, Politico, June 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a major speech to the Council on Foreign Relations on Wednesday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says the United States risks &#8220;national suicide&#8221; if it doesn&rsquo;t adopt a more welcoming immigration policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not remain a global superpower if we continue to close our doors to people who want to come here to work hard, start businesses, and pursue the American dream,&#8221; Bloomberg said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American dream cannot survive if we keep telling the dreamers to go elsewhere,&#8221; the mayor adds. &#8220;It&rsquo;s what I call national suicide  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s not hyperbole.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bloomberg&rsquo;s speech comes as the Partnership for a New American Economy, of which he is a co-chair, releases a <a href="/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf">report</a> looking at the role that immigrants play at Fortune 500 companies and the potential. Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants, the report notes. Together, the companies employ more than 10 million people worldwide and generate annual revenue of $4.2 trillion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The federal government, he says, must introduce a pathway to citizenship for the more than 11 million people in the country who entered illegally or overstayed visas. He&rsquo;d also like to [see] an increase on the number of H1-B visas awarded by the government.</p>

		<p>NYC Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s-dispossess-the-white-population-with-smart-immigrants-by-giving-a-pathway-to-citizenship-to-11-20-illegal-aliens argument is similar to the 25-percent-of-patents-come-from-foreign-born immigrants argument.</p>
<p>John Derbyshire exposes Bloomberg&rsquo;s intellectual fraud in this excerpt of his description of a recent televised debate on immigration:</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies were quoted, numbers tossed back and forth: 25 percent of patent applications come from foreign-born persons (Jacoby); immigrant welfare usage is $140 billion net of taxes paid (Kobach).</p>
<p>&#8220;If you know the territory it&rsquo;s easy to spot the fudges and evasions employed by the immigration enthusiasts. Take that &#8216;25 percent,&rsquo; for example. Duke University counted up the patent applications filed by immigrant non-citizens in the years 1998-2006, breaking them out by the applicant&rsquo;s country of citizenship. The top twenty contributing countries were, in order: China (including Taiwan), India, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Russia, Korea, Japan, Australia, Italy, Israel, Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ireland, Greece, and Iran. NOT MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT THERE FOR MASS IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA [my all-caps], which is the mass immigration we&rsquo;ve actually been getting.&rdquo; </p>

<p>If I remember correctly, 12% of immigrants come from Europe and another 12% come from Asia. 40% of 500 companies is 200. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that over 75% of those 200 came from these immigrants, who only make up 24% of the immigrant population.</p>

		<p>The notion that there is some sort of shortage of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; to America, is about as preposterous a claim as I have ever heard! And just for good measure, Bloomberg invokes the completely and utterly arbitrary &#8220;11 million&#8221; number as the sum of those here illegally. Remarkable that this was roughly the same number used more than a decade ago, and somehow, as if by magic, while hundreds and hundreds of thousands (or more) flooded in since then annually, the number remained essentially the same!?!

		<p>I had to check the race of Mayor Michael Bloomberg because this is the kind of inverted thinking blacks are often guilty of. </p>
<p>Naturally, when I saw the headline &#8220;U.S. Immigration Policy Is &lsquo;National Suicide&rsquo;&#8221; I thought this was a man who was willing to speak the truth. Imagine my shock when I discovered that it&rsquo;s not our current immigration <i>policy</i> but our longstanding immigration LAWS that he&rsquo;s going on about. </p>
<p>If our immigration policy (at least the one we used to practice) is &#8220;national suicide,&#8221; then why, pray tell, have we been doing just fine as a nation for over 200 years? As should be obvious to anyone but an idiot, it&rsquo;s not our immigration policy but the changes we have been making to it recently that are &#8220;national suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before White Americans can permanently reverse the executive outcomes of corporate corruption, whites must first unify from the politics set in place to divide us.</p>

		<p>While Bloomberg is on his campaign, I wish he would answer a question I&rsquo;ve had for many years about his theory of greater immigrant vigor. Why is America itself not able to maintain the vigor of its population? What is America doing wrong? According to Bloomberg, after a couple of generations, even the immigrants themselves conform to the dull uncreative routine of the settled American population. </p>

		<p>The wealthy elites are aware that Europe and North America possess four-fifths of the cultivable land on the planet.</p>
<p>Blinded by their greed, they imagine both continents as &#8216;under-exploited&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>They imagine them carrying a billion people each, in overcrowded cities where water and energy are rationed and the rivers are too polluted to swim in. Yet, more importantly to them, all of these billions of souls consume goods and services, with profits trickling up to the richest stakeholders.  Immigration makes the dream possible.</p>
<p>The only thing standing in their way is the rising tide of nationalism which opposes immigration.</p>

		<p>nancy pelosi said there were 20,000,000 illegals here.  10% or 2,000,000 have felony records and only 2% work in agriculture.  Why do we have to import criminals?  With high unemployment and ruuning out of tax money we import cheap labor and welfare sponges.  Washington is an insane assylum to continue this.</p>

		<p>Yes, mr. Bloomberg.Just look how well the last immigration fuelled &#8216;boom&rsquo; worked out, just look at  the consequences of building all those new homes for all those &#8216;hard working, ambitious immigrants&rsquo;.<br>
  The sky rocketing of American national debt, the collapse of the dollar, 10%+ unemployment, half the population on food stamps, and the collapse of Greece were just symptoms along the way.<br>
 But who am I to argue with Michael Bloomberg?</p>

<p>Despite being a billionaire, Bloomberg (just like <br>
Soros et al)  is as left-wingy as you can get (when if comes to immigration and demographics).  By his position on this, he has identified himself an enemy of the American people. He wants to see us dispossed and eliminated. He&rsquo;s so self-confident (call it brazen) that he doesn&rsquo;t even try to hide the fact. (Formerly, they would have done so.) </p>
<p>These people are the mysterious, unelected, governing &#8220;elite&#8221; that we so often read about.  They have no interest in America or Americans. They don&rsquo;t identify with us! We are just robots to produce for them a profit.  For them, everything is about MONEY&hellip; corporations, patents, profits, bottom lines.  For us, there is more to life, and more to America, than money.</p>
<p>For them, America is just a place to make money.  For us, it is our home.  They care nothing about that.</p>
<p>Like Soros, Bloomberg is a cosmopolite.  He has homes around the world, including an estate in Bermuda.  When the crash hits here, or the riots, he&rsquo;ll be on his plane heading for his nice, quiet island or somewhere else where he can ride out the storm.</p>

		<p> Bloomberg is an immigration sentimentalist who lives in the past. No one is stopping Nobel Prize winning scientists or millionaire business men from immigrating to the United States. As most immigration is driven by family connections  &mdash;  chain migration  &mdash;  the majority of our immigrants are from poor Third World countries. In addition, we have almost eleven million, mostly impoverished, immigrants, who are here illegally. I can&rsquo;t see how during periods of endemic high unemployment letting in huge numbers of immigrants benefits our country or our people. </p>

<p><br>
You might suppose  that People of the ilk of Bloomberg and Soros, being vastly wealthy,  would be conservatives.  But not so!  </p>
<p>When it comes to questions of population, racial/national identity, demographics, they are screaming left-wingers, as far out left as any hippy radical. Those such as Bloomberg are dedicated to tearing down and demolishing whatever ethnic identity exists in any nation they get into.   This makes it easier for them to control it.  They are the worm in the apple. These profiteers are destroyers, simply out for their own profit, even if it&rsquo;s everyone else&rsquo;s grief.</p>

<p>You are right, but Bloomberg is not concerned about your people (or your country). He is concerned about benefitting himself. All those additional eating, breathing bodies must still consume goods and services  (to his profit).  They also  keep wages down for the rest of the population   &mdash;    again to his profit. It&rsquo;s not good for you, but it&rsquo;s great for him.</p>
<p>You are making a huge mistake in thinking that he&rsquo;s concerned about YOU.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t is nice to see an &#8220;objective&#8221; report.  No mention of the crimes caused by illegal Hispanics, etc.  No mention of when the immigrants or their children who found various corporations came.  You can bet that many came here a long time ago and assilulated, somthing the illegals do not do now.  Also, one from Cuba and one from the middle east.  Is that why we don&rsquo;t allow many legal immigrants from Europe.  What nonsense!</p>

		<p>Mayor Bloomberg is indirectly insulting the American people by implying (even without saying it) that Americans are lazy, uninventive, unenterprising, and that we could not get along without immigrants to keep our economy going.</p>
<p>Obviously he is no friend of the American people, and he does not think very well of us. In fact, he can hardly wait to replace us.<br>

		<p>So to remain a superpower we must import millions more Mestizos (average IQ 90 - 95) and hundreds of thousands of Somalis (average IQ 
<p>Anyhow, what&rsquo;s this obsession with being a &#8220;superpower&#8221;?  All that means is that your country gets to fight most of the wars, a privilege I&rsquo;d be happy to confer on some other nation.</p>
<p>Bloomberg is basically saying that native born Americans are too stupid to maintain their own country.  Who needs a racist like that?</p></p>

		<p>Post number 9 pretty much sums it up. Civilizations do not fall because of military confrontation, incessant immigration or resources depletion - these are all only symptoms. The cause for the fall is simple. Interests of the Businessman take precedence over interests of the Scientist. You can build civilization for centuries but give the steering wheel of the society in the hands of the Businessman and he will bring it down within a fraction of that time.</p>

Rich people benefit from a high degree of immigration. A rising population means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. </p>

Businessmen are necessary to a well functioning economy, but it is also necessary that the government control them, and not the other way around. <br>
 <br>
I would like for more college professors to go into politics, especially political scientists, historians, and teachers of political philosophy. Many have opinions that are based more on theory than reality, but exposure to real power, and the responsibilities of power would correct that in most cases. After a career in politics they could go back to the Academy with an enhanced knowledge of their fields. <br>
 <br>
Businessmen seldom understand very much beyond the walls of their companies. </p>
