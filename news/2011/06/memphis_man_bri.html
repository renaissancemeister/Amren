<h1>Memphis Man Brings Gun to Party After Kids Miss Ice Cream, Cake</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WREG News (Memphis), June 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Instead of a present, a Memphis, TN man brought a gun to a child&rsquo;s birthday party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say Hayes brought a gun to the party because his children didn&rsquo;t get any ice cream or cake.</p>
<p>A police affidavit says Hayes became upset and began yelling at the victim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hayes approached the host, lifted up his shirt and said, &#8220;I ain&rsquo;t scared to go to jail, just take care of my kids.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Absent from mention in the reports of recent &#8220;wildings&#8221; about black youths in public spaces are the ones that pour in from time to time at Chuckie-Cheese, the family-oriented party venue. They occur with some frequency and Youtube does a pretty handy job of aggregating these incidents.</p>
<p>Considering that the mainstream media has elected to replace the word &#8220;black&#8221; with &#8220;youth,&#8221; I wonder how long it will be before we hear on the local newscast one night: &#8220;A fifty-three year-old youth was charged with disorderly conduct today.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Another reason to embrace diversity. I would hate to see what happens if a fast food joint runs out of a particular item and the delivery truck is slated for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. This guy could do his own version of the fast food scene in &#8220;Falling Down&#8221;. This is about as bright as calling 911 three times over McNuggets. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t scared to go to jail, just take care of my kids.&rdquo; What a great reason to go to the slammer; flour, eggs, sugar &amp; cream,. My guess is that this individual cannot plan ahead more than five minutes. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s stories like this one that makes me question AmRen and their intentions. All we read about on AmRen is absentee black fathers and the fact they refuse to become involved in their childrens&rsquo; upbringing. We finally get a story of a black father supporting his children and the moderators post it in a negative light.</p>

<p>Reminds me of a situation where we had a birthday party for my daughter with several family members over. A black man approached the gate, that apparently lived down the street, and said his daughter was &#8216;begging me&rsquo; to let her join our party. Coaxed by others she was allowed in. Many years later, that same girl threw rocks at my son, and cut his ear open.</p>

		<p>Now, if this doesn&rsquo;t take the CAKE (ok, ok, I just HAD to&hellip;)  The photo clearly shows that this guy is so stupid he can&rsquo;t think beyond getting his kids ice cream and cake fo&rsquo;dey birfday&hellip;  What was he gonna do, blow a hole in the cake so nobody&rsquo;d get any?</p>

		<p>I was going to say I found it hard to believe  &mdash;  even a black guy wouldn&rsquo;t threaten to shoot someone over their child&rsquo;s birthday cake and there MUST be more to this story.</p>
<p>So I pulled up the original story and saw this story&hellip;.wow&hellip;just when you think you have heard it all. Kids testify Daddy took them to the store to buy a saw the day &#8220;Mama&#8221; disappeared&hellip;and it gets better&hellip;.he returned the saw AFTER he used it!!! Plus made the kids clean the place of forensic evidence! </p>

		<p>Down here in Mississippi, if you want to gather a large group of blacks (which generally means you are a con artist or a politician&hellip;.or maybe I should phrase it, &#8220;&hellip;a politician or other type of con artist, such as a Used Car Dealer&#8221;), you offer free food, or even just free refreshments.  </p>
<p>Cars brimming with little brown persons will soon converge, and it&rsquo;s basically like running the hogs into the pen to be slopped.  Roughly the same sounds and mode of eating.</p>
<p>I grew up on a farm not nearly far enough from Memphis, and have relatives who still are insured by Farm Bureau.  They have annual board meetings.  Used to be, they had refreshments.  I think it was kind of a big to-do.  Then, when the Kennedy Johnson Great Society unleashed hordes of blacks upon every aspect of our world, the blacks and their children would hog the refreshments.  Every black would bring every head of offspring to the meetings, so they could git them those free refreshments.</p>
<p>Well, first, Farm Bureau tried scaling-down the refreshments to bare minimum.  No more Deviled Eggs, made by the member ladies.  No more Homemade Ice Cream. (I think everyone just stopped bringing things, when they saw what was happening to them)  Just cheap Punch and cheap Cookies.  That didn&rsquo;t help one bit.  The blacks knocked over the refreshment tables, just like they do on International Children&rsquo;s Day in Africa.  More important, the presence of every single black child who could be fitted into every car pretty much precluded an orderly and productive meeting.</p>
<p>Now, the meeting announcements BOLDLY remind everyone (at the top of the page, no less) that NO REFRESHMENTS WILL BE SERVED.</p>
<p>So, you see, Mr. Hayes was only being true to the culture of our region.  The Slopping of the Hogs is an important part of any event, down here.  And it&rsquo;s the daddy&rsquo;s duty to help ensure that his bebbehz git run up to the Feeding Trough, too. </p>

		<p>It seems a little odd for the adults holding the party not to give some of the kids any of the food.  It&rsquo;s possible the guy&rsquo;s kids were behaving so badly at the party they got kicked out, hence the father&rsquo;s rage.  Considering what their Dad is like, if the kids take after him, I could see it happening.</p>
<p>I also wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the kids actually did get the cake and ice cream, but told Daddy they hadn&rsquo;t, in the hopes that Daddy would feel sorry for them and buy them more of the same to &#8216;make it up to them.&rsquo;  <br>
  <br>
In a case where the parent isn&rsquo;t a decent human being, the kids tend not to be, either.<br>

<p>Correct!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered, as well, that going to the &#8220;original article&#8221; often uncovers more gems about diversity. I&rsquo;m almost reluctant to hit the link because of what I might find.</p>
<p>Then again, AmRen will never run short of material.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;This is about as bright as calling 911 over Mc Niuggetts&#8221; This story has been been &#8220;misunderstood&#8221; for lack of a better word. She did NOT call 911 over them being out of Mc Nuggetts! She called because the clerk took her money and the did not give it back. If you paid $20.00 for gas, the pump didn`t work and the clerk refused to give you your money back becuase she had already &#8220;rung it up&#8221; wouldn`t you call the police too?!? This story is about stupidity, but it`s the clerks, not the black lady customers. She did exactly what I would have done it that situation and what a lot of others would too&hellip;<br>

		<p>After reading this story and the one about the saw it kinda makes you wonder about the validity of the theory that the Black community is the way it is due to absentee fathers. Well so much for that!</p>

		<p>He looks a little old to have children young enough to attend birthday parties where ice cream and cake are de rigueur, doesn&rsquo;t he?  Article says he&rsquo;s 48, and he looks about 68.</p>

		<p>I read this story a few hours ago and laughed when I first read it. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m wondering whether the reason why the man became so threatening over his kids not getting ice cream and cake was because he had nothing else to feed them, and was counting on that being their meal for the day. I&rsquo;m not trying to apologize for him, as it&rsquo;s all the more reason why people shouldn&rsquo;t have children if they can&rsquo;t afford them. @7 Lauren&rsquo;s post also makes me think this, if any event which offers free food is attracting black families with a lot of kids. </p>

		<p>Hey can you blame the guy? He is black and he wanted something for free, that is their nature.</p>
<p>Memphis needs to change it&rsquo;s name to Little Detroit, it&rsquo;s on the path, that is for sure.</p>

		<p>I never used to believe such stories of food, blacks and social trends.  Then I worked for about four years as a vendor filling coin-op snack machines.  In that time I was approached time and time again with the same question: &#8220;Got any free samples?&#8221;  No white person ever asked me that.  They were all black, and it did much to form my opinion that a class can be molded with the issuing of free food, free welfare, free affirmative action into thinking that a white businessman is expected to hand over his goods.  He becomes a kind of mark, a rich &#8220;massa&#8221; so to speak.  Indeed a classic mark from whom you as a black are expected to loot, rob, riot and take as much free stuff from because its all justified because you are just getting even.  So you are going to pull a gun and riot if you are not shown the proper respect of being offered your free slice.  Makes me want to practice segregation wherever I can.</p>

You were wondering about the validity of the perception of absentee ghetto fathers based on this story.  This man could have been mama&rsquo;s latest live-in boyfriend, or he could actually be the biological dad and live clear across town.  The kids could have called him on a cell phone, for all we know.  No doubt, the guy saw the whole affair as an insult to him personally.  Underclass blacks perceive &#8220;disses&#8221; at every turn.</p>

Questioning the intentions and motives of political opponents is such a common and well used tactic when its impossible to come up with reasonable arguments. It breaks the attention to the case itself, and it brings up imagination which can produce ideas which are so way out of sight that they cannot be mentioned.</p>

		<p>In Daly City, Ca a black crashed a party. After being told politely to leave, he pulled a gun. One of the party attedents was a MMA (mixed martial arts) expert. He quickly disarmed the black with the gun, almost breaking his arm.The party crasher will not plead guilty, and get a 5 year sentence. Instead, he will risk getting 20 years.</p>
