<h1><a href="https://hispanicohio.northcoastnow.com/2011/06/07/more-hispanics-go-to-federal-prison/">More Hispanics Go to Federal Prison</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Garance Burke, Atlanta Journal Constitution, June 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Expedited court hearings along the border are a major force driving a seismic demographic shift in who is being sent to federal prison. Statistics released this week revealed that Hispanics now comprise nearly half of all people sentenced for federal felony crimes, a number swollen by immigration offenses. In comparison, Hispanics last year made up 16 percent of the total U.S. population.</p>
<p>Sentences for felony immigration crimes, which include illegal crossing as well as other crimes such as alien smuggling, accounted for about 87 percent of the increase in the number of Hispanics sent to prison over the past decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Sentencing Commission data.</p>
<p>The trend has divided lawmakers and officials in the courts and along the border. Some politicians believe the en masse hearings should be expanded to deter illegal immigration. Others question whether the system actually affects people seeking to cross the border, while some contend the programs distract prosecutors from pursuing more serious crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Operation Streamline and other fast-track programs speed illegal immigrants through accelerated legal proceedings, where most guilty pleas come in Spanish and thousands of Mexican citizens end up locked up each year for entering the country without papers.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Hennessey of San Francisco was on TV this morning speaking against this law.  Most Mayors and city council members nation wide advocate getting rid of this law.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t send home the restaurant, construction, hotel and supermarket help can we?</p>

		<p>I wonder if the word got out in Mexico that if you illegally cross the border, and or commit crimes once you are in the US, you will go to federal prison? I can only hope that the sentences are long enough to be a deterrrent.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll trade you, you liberal sophist bleeding hearts.</p>
<p>Each Mexican we let go gets their saved court costs assigned to a trench fee.  Ten feet deep by twenty feet wide, with mines down the middle.</p>
<p>To be dug by the illegal in question.  Ten feet of trench per man, per crossing.  And he can go home.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it will work?</p>
<p>Say we catch 1 in 3 illegals per year, about 500,000 total.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 5 million feet of trench per year.  Divided by 5,280 = 947 miles of border barrier.  </p>
<p>The total length of said border is only 2,400 miles long.  Three years and we&rsquo;re done!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d even throw in the work gloves and as much water as these fine folk need to make the dusty concrete that passes for dirt down there penetrable by shovel.</p>

		<p>Uh, has anyone noticed that the Hispanic population has GROWN exponentially over the past 20+ years???  More Hispanics = more Hispanic prisoners.  Not such a difficult equation to grasp.</p>

		<p>This article is extremely (intentionally) misleading.  Despite decades of effort to change the law, it is NOT a federal felony to be an illegal alien.  Such a change in the law, by the way, would make it a lot easier to force ICE to do its job by upping the seriousness of the crime to more in line with reality.</p>
<p>Anyway, arresting an illegal alien, in no way, by itself, contributes to people sentenced to federal felony crimes.  What is happening here is, due to crackdowns locally on illegal immigrants, far more rapists, murderers and thieves are being caught and prosecuted.</p>
<p>Prior to the crackdowns, these people were still there, they just raped, robbed, murdered and kidnapped, people, sold drugs, whatever, with impunity.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not a stretch to say that, one of the reasons these people came to the US, in the first place, is they knew, politically, the liberals and neo-cons were seriously interfering with the investigation of illegals and KNEW this would allow them to seek out victims without fear of law enforcement.</p>
<p>Understand what I am saying.  We had large numbers of people who committed heinous crimes, who would have instantly been caught had their ID or fingerprints been run through the system, who walked our communities with impunity, even committed petty drug crimes, knowing full well that law enforcement would avoid going after them because they&rsquo;ve been told not to enforce immigration law.  The local beat cop sees Paco, the local drug dealer dealing yet again, on his street corner but turns the other way because his sergeant has told him not to go after illegals.  What he doesn&rsquo;t know is Paco is wanted for three murders in various states and his fingerprints are attached to a dozen rape cases.</p>
<p>Unintended consequences?  I would argue not at all.  Which is why those responsible should be punished, when the time comes, as full accomplices to these crimes.  Their intent was to terrorize whites, not only with the scope of non-white ultra-violent crime but the sheer lack of protection.</p>
<p>Whites are told, you don&rsquo;t need guns&hellip;..only cops handle criminals&hellip;.yet, the cop is quick to give you a ticket for a broken tail light&hellip;..but purposefully not involved catching non-white rapists prowling your town.</p>
<p>Oklahoma city is a perfect example.  Little to no punishment for those who came to rape, rob, murder and assault.  But self-defense nets a murder one conviction.</p>
<p>And what type of wacko enters a place of business waving a gun around anyway?</p>
<p>The type who expects to get away with it.</p>

I agree and until we come to that FACT that this was all deliberate by those surrounding and inside our own government for DECADES then we are spinning our wheels.  Just look at all the anti-White laws they have put into effect since the 40&rsquo;s and BEFORE. Doesn&rsquo;t that alone wake up these brain dead White &#8220;Christians&#8221; and those on the left and the right? Obviously it hasn&rsquo;t. I have never in my lifetime seen so many dumbed down White people. I, especially blame the infiltrated Christian churches, which has been led by the wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. What has happened to the White Man&rsquo;s religion, for petes sake?</p>
