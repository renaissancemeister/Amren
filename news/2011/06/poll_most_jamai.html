<h1>Poll: Most Jamaicans Believe UK Rule Better</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, June 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poll of 1,008 Jamaicans for The Gleaner newspaper was conducted over four days by U.S. pollster Bill Johnson. Sixty percent of those surveyed believed the island would be better off if it had remained a U.K. colony.</p>
<p>Seventeen percent said the island would be worse off as a British colony and 23 percent said they did not know. The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.</p>
<p>Jamaica achieved independence from Britain in 1962.</p>
<p>Since then, the island has struggled with high crime, a hefty debt burden and inefficient government.</p>

		<p>Nice to see that black people - whatever their other qualities or lack thereof - are not short of common sense. I think it was of Jamaica that a nineteenth century liberal colonial officer spoke when he said that the black man was quite capable of being a civilized citizen provided always that he was under the control and direction of the white man. </p>

<p>1998 poll<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/ozeMC" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/ozeMC</a>  </p>
<p>3% chose independence</p>
<p>2009 poll<br>
https://goo.gl/tPq6Z</p>
<p>This summer&rsquo;s InstaPoll found independence was cited by only 4% of respondents as their status preference. This percentage has been somewhat constant in the past few years.</p>

		<p>Most Jamaicans probably would say the same if their colonizer were Nigeria or any other country.  When people are having hardship, they say anything to make<br>
the current government look bad.  And beside many of those polled likely  were either too young or not yet born to know what  UK rule was like in Jamaica since Jamaica obtained independence almost 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Barbados is a good example of a country that is ruled by blacks and is doing well. It is ranked better than the UK on the latest Corruption Perception Index obtaining a score of 17 compared to a score 20 for the UK. To put it into perspective, Russia scored 154 which is worse than Haiti (146), and Jamaica even scored better than European country such as Bosnia, Belarus and Kosovo. </p>
<p>If UK rule in Jamaica  would be better in Jamaica given problems it is facing then  its rule could also be better in other European countries too such as those listed above. So this is not about race just countries with too much corruption.</p>

		<p>Anyone surprised by this survey should read the book advertised in the left column as &#8220;Amazing New Book About Africa&#8221;.  The author found that most blacks on that continent openly admit that white rule is better than black. They often vote for other blacks because of threats of punishment by witchcraft.  Voters are told that those seeking power will magically know what ballot they cast, and the common folk believe them.  <br>

<p>I would like to challenge your cherry picked examples;</p>
<p>&#8220;When people are having hardship they say anything to make the current government look bad&#8221;.</p>
<p>When has Jamaica ever known anything else since 1962? Mind telling us when exactly Jamaica enjoyed its golden period and renaissance?</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbados is a good example of a country ruled by blacks and is doing well&#8221;.</p>
<p>Funny how of all the dozens of black countries in the world that is the only one you could find. How about Haiti? Or Zimbabwe? Uganda? The Congo? In any case Barbados is 166 square miles in size and has a population of only 285,000 or so. Also 20% of its population is non-black, Asians and a few whites. This probably makes a considerable difference. Nor is there any shortage of blacks trying to emigrate from Barbados to white countries. Do Haitians get in their boats and go to Barbados? No. They come to Florida.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is ranked better then the U.K on the corruption index&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Since Britain is now so racially and ethnically mixed, we really have no way of knowing how corrupt the indigenous British actually are now do we?</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia scored 154 which is worse then Haiti&#8221;..</p>
<p>IF I HAD TO CHOOSE I&rsquo;d still pick living in Moscow over Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jamaica even scored better then Bosnia, Belarus and Kosovo&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kosovo is an American created muslim gangster state that is a base for human smuggling, sex slavery and drugs. It shouldn&rsquo;t even be in existence as it rightfully belonged to Serbia.</p>
<p>Bosnia is another multi-ethnic mess with a huge muslim population. It is an artificial state, largely created by the buffoonery of American foreign policy. It is not really a country at all.</p>
<p>As for Belarus it is not a free country and never recovered from the incredible devastation it suffered during ww2. When was the last war fought in Jamaica?</p>
<p>For me the tragedy is that the U.K. didn&rsquo;t give Jamaica its independence in say, 1947? Then Jamaicans would have been ineligible to come to Britain under the Labour party&rsquo;s ludicrous British nationality act. For that act ALONE Labour should never have gotten a single vote from any Briton ever again.</p>

Corruption goes where Black Rule goes. But lets<br>
agree that the Blacks are only lamenting about British Rule<br>
as a ploy. The thing for Britain to do is HANDS OFF.<br>
Once the Brits reappear and start to set things straight<br>
once again..Jamaicans will look around..see all the goodies<br>
that could be theirs and start screaming Racism..and Oppression<br>
and Black Rule!! and the whole cycle would begin again.</p>

		<p>Most blacks need, and many of them want, benevolent paternalism. They need clearly defined rules, strictly enforced, and the assurance that if they obey those rules they will be taken care of if they are not able to perform well intellectually. <br>
 <br>
To a considerable extent that was the social contract in the South before the civil rights movement. The problem with segregation was that some blacks are able to perform and behave as well as whites. The problem with integration is that most are not. </p>

Absolute twaddle! The reason my country has an inferior Corruption Perception Index rating is precisely due to being jam-packed with Third Worlders who have little or no chance of ever integrating or assimilating. We are infested with them; but there will be a reckoning within my lifetime and the criminal political elites will pay for their wickedness. </p>
<p>From the awkward nature of the prose you have submitted as comment I would guess that you are some deluded liberal who has not yet experienced the wonderful benefits of diversity. <br>

		<p>Jamaica does it better than European countries like Kosovo?<br>
 Kosovo is  a newly captured muslim country. The muslim percentage of Bosnia can explain its placing. Barbados is hardly big enough to host a mob.<br>
 What goes on in Belarus, i dont really know but the Europeanness of those eastern states have been challenged, since mongol reign 1200 AD.<br>
Just wait 40 years, then Sweden and UK can be used in such statistics to show how Europeans fail in elementary society conduct. As they have been replaced by the unnameable.</p>

		<p>I would offer a few words of caution, regarding the tendency on the part of some of my fellow white racial realists to interpret these kinds of polls as evidence that Whites did the &#8216;right&rsquo; thing by trying to colonize these non-white areas of the world.  </p>
<p>While I will admit that a perfectly solid argument could be made to point to the many advantages that these non-whites gained as a result of our involvement in their primitive and backwards nations, hindsight should have taught us by now that these gifts of white technology, white agricultural knowledge &amp; expertise, white medical genius, white scientific advancements - none of these things that whites shared with non-whites has resulted in non-whites loving the white man or being willing to show, as Pat Buchanan has said, any lasting gratitude towards whites.</p>
<p>If anything, I suspect that these gifts have only served to hammer in the inferiority and lack of equality that exists between the races deeper and deeper into the consciences of non-whites and has made them resent and despise us even more, since we are a living, breathing, walking reminder of the enormous inadequacies that are so prevalent among most tribes of non-whites.  </p>
<p>Also, thanks to white technology and white medicine - the populations in the non-white world have exploded like never before - while the white percentage of the world&rsquo;s population and the white birth rate has dropped to levels that spell our extinction, if we do not turn things around.   </p>
<p>So, if and when whites do manage to reverse course - which includes aggressively removing from power every last anti-white, white race traitorous politician - as well as the Cultural Marxist enemies of the White West - any new White nation that emerges from the ashes of the now destroyed America - can NEVER again succumb to the temptation to engage in colonialism.  The negatives that our race have suffered because of it far outweigh <br>
any benefits derived from it, and we should remember that lesson.</p>
<p>Whites must also learn to do their own dirty jobs, and never again seek to rely upon cheap, non-white labor - because that has always been the camel&rsquo;s nose under the tent - and has repeatedly lead to our own dispossession to hostile, non-white races who breed faster than we do and who will always eventually outnumber us.     <br>

<p>The concept of an &#8220;empire&#8221; has to be just about the dumbest thing white people ever came up with, much less put into action.  Almost every empire in the history of Caucasian civilization winds up destroying the host nation, and by &#8220;nation,&#8221; I mean it in the literal sense (derived from the Latin &#8220;nascere,&#8221; to be born, i.e. an ethno-state).  </p>
<p>Personally, I rue the day that the first English-speaking white person set foot on the Indian subcontinent.  Between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the former British Raj, you have 1.4 billion people now, so you have hundreds of millions of adults who both speak English and are willing to work cheap.  We all know what that means   &mdash;   Outsourced to Bangalore, or you&rsquo;re laid off at the age of 35 so that an H-1B visa holding subcontinental can take your job at a fraction of your former salary and benefits.</p>

		<p>It was recently stated on the radio that there are one million West Indians (Jamaicans) in England. Recently, it was also stated that there are 200,000 Zimbabweans in the country, many in the Bristol area where Mugabe&rsquo;s chief torturer has lived on benefits with his wife (both HIV positive) for 11 years. I tried to check the Zimbabwean population figure, but, surprise, no exact figures are available - it ranges from 122,000 to 500,000.  Both of these black populations should not be in England, and, worse, their numbers seem to be growing.</p>

		<p>Somehow the selfless and kind  white elites had colonized other<br>
&#8216;backward&rsquo; nations to help them to see the light and to provide<br>
them with western technologies. Yet many on Amren argued that<br>
the white elites in western nations are selling out the west<br>
by importing non-whites . <br>
You cant have it both ways. If colonizaton by whites were to<br>
benefit the non-whites , then how comes the same whites are<br>
accused of engaging in selfish act by supporting the demographic<br>
transformation of western nations through immigration ?<br>
The truth is that he purpose of colonization was to enrich<br>
the colonizer not to help those who were colonized. </p>

They have fallen into the Pit of Multiculturalism that is destroying what was once a Great Country.<br>
The USA isn&rsquo;t far behind in this foolish thinking and I am amazed how Very Few Whites even consider any of this a problem.<br>
Maybe just maybe when they are mobbed and beaten by these YOUTHS as the press loves to call them they will wake up.<br>
But honestly I don&rsquo;t know if the so called men of America have any interest in anything other than video games and football.<br>
I bet the Founders of our country are turning over in their graves seeing what we have done and are doing with the Greatest Country the World has ever known.</p>

		<p>Jamaica had a white Prime Minister from 1980 - 1989. Anti-communist Conservative Mr Edward Seaga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Seaga" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Seaga</a> was leader of the Right-wing Jamaica Labor Party. He was a good friend of President Ronald Reagan, Senator Trent Lott and other Conservative Republicans. Economic growth was high during his tenure but a whispering campaign against him hankered for a black leftist PM. A few years later PJ Patterson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Patterson" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Patterson</a> became PM and the rest is history.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually shocked.  Of all the black nations of the world, I always thought the Jamaicans had the most national pride.  To find that they realize their country was better off during British rule is quite surprising.  Hopefully the British will some day come to their senses and take back what they gave away half a century ago.</p>

<p>As one poster wrote the British cant even run its own country<br>
let alone others. Before the century concluded, the majority<br>
of people living in Britian wont even be native British as 2065<br>
the nation will be a majority non-white nation . <br>
This is due not only to immigration but many whites are leaving<br>

<p>What a buffoon this Nicholas Kristof must be</p>
<p>It is guesstimated that there are some 3 million (Black) Zimbabwean illegal immigrants / refugees in South Africa.<br>
The reason?<br>
Thanks to Robert Mugabe their country is a basket case.<br>
There are no jobs and food production is declining due to Mugabe&rsquo;s policy of chasing the commercial food producing white farmers off their lands - violently if necessary</p>
<p>Why do the destitute Zimbabweans head for South Africa? (as they also did during the &#8220;evil&#8221; apartheid years)<br>
Because it still has a reasonably robust economy 90% owned and controlled by white people. Thats where (hopefully) the jobs and the food are.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar doesn&rsquo;t it? Just like Mexico and the USA.</p>
<p>These 3 million Zimbabweans are competing with another 7 million economic migrants/illegal immigrants/ asylum seekers/refugees from the rest of Africa and the 35 million local blacks for ever decreasing resources<br>
Local blacks have resorted to &#8220;xenophobic killings&#8221; of foreign blacks to safeguard their jobs at the bottom of the food chain.</p>
<p>1 million of South Africa&rsquo;s 5 million whites (the professionals and entrepreneurs) have decided to quit and emigrate to civilised first world English speaking countries <br>
Those left behind have to contend with an escalating crime rate from marauding ferrel (foreign?) gangs who resort to violent crime in order to survive<br>
As in Zimbabwe the white commercial farmer is now an endangered species.<br>
Read about their plight on www. genocide watch</p>
<p>Obviously Kristof knows very little about the black African in Africa.<br>
They are very economical with the truth and will say whatever they think the interviewer wants to hear.</p>
<p>Zimbabweans may be happy that whitey no longer runs the country but they are materially infinitely worse off than they were under a white government.<br>
 I suggest Kristof reads Ian Smith&rsquo;s auotobiography: &#8220;Bitter Harvest - The Great Betrayal&#8221;. <br>
Find the chapter where Smith talks of the non stop visits to his house by moderate black people asking him to do something after he was removed from power and Mugabe took over.</p>
<p>The truth is this.<br>
I worked with a pro Mugabe black Zimbabwean in London<br>
He told me that all the negative press about Zimbabwe in the UK was media exaggerated and a distortion of the truth.<br>
In his next breath he told me that he visited Zimbabwe every year to see his family, but that he would be selling the car that he keeps there as it was now virtually impossible to buy fuel for it. </p>
<p>I also have a Christian (white) friend who is spending his retirement organising and taking food convoys into Zimbabwe. <br>
He told me that what he saw was; &#8220;the situation is worse than critical&#8221; <br>
Starving (black) people stumbling around in the bush of what was once the bread-basket of Africa, eating the bark on trees.<br>
I marvel at his optimism.<br>
Just how on earth is this problem going to be solved without government action?<br>
In South Africa&rsquo;s case 4 million whites cannot carry 35 million local blacks any longer.<br>
It is time black people shaped up and took on the responsibility of their own destiny</p>
<p>Wake up America.<br>
This is what is coming your way. </p>
