			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Nancarrow, Brisbane Times, June 7, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Brisbane woman [was] jailed for adultery in Dubai after she complained of being drugged and raped by co-workers has been granted leave to sue the Australian government over her ordeal.</p>
<p>Alicia Gali&rsquo;s lawyer Michelle James, a principal at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, said Australian embassy staff failed to warn the 29-year-old that a complaint of rape in the United Arab Emirates could lead to her being jailed.</p>
<p>Ms Gali was charged with adultery and sentenced to 11 months in prison, serving eight, after bringing the incident to the attention of police in 2008.</p>
<p>Her request to sue the Commonwealth was scheduled to be heard in the Brisbane Supreme Court this morning, but it emerged today the Australian government had yesterday consented to Ms Gali&rsquo;s lawyers being granted leave to file proceedings.</p>
<p>She has also been granted leave to sue her former employer, Le Meridien Al Aqah Beach Resort, in Queensland&rsquo;s Supreme Court, alleging the resort breached its workplace obligations by failing to have systems in place to protect workers against assault.</p>
<p>Today, Ms James told a media conference the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had failed in its obligations to Ms Gali, directly leading to her being jailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;She should have been told, as a bare minimum, of the local laws that apply in the UAE,&#8221; Ms James said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the UAE, rape is not a crime unless it is witnessed by four adult male Muslim witnesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alicia wasn&rsquo;t told this. She certainly wasn&rsquo;t told that if she reported the brutal rape to the police that she ran the risk of being jailed for 12 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alicia was merely told that she should &#8216;reconsider her need to be in the country&rsquo; at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms James said DFAT information read by Ms Gali before she left for Dubai provided no warning of the consequences of reporting a sexual assault.</p>
<p>She said Ms Gali was trying to rebuild her life but the trauma of her overseas ordeal was long-lasting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think those effects will be with her for a lifetime,&#8221; Ms James said.</p>

		<p>One of the most basic functions, or should I say procedures, of diplomacy is tit for tat. The two governments behaving in ways that are acceptable to each other and in line with what the other believes is due as far as respect. </p>
<p>  It seems to me that we have gotten a long way from this and to our great disadvantage. If I was the Australian prime minister I would have jailed their diplomat for eight months until they released the lady or came around to the Australian point of view. Or maybe ripped the clothes off their women and paraded them in bikinis on Bondi Beach for jailing any one of ours who didn`t cover up on their turf. I know it sounds stupid and childish but what else would or do they &#8220;respect&#8221;?</p>
<p>  The rest of the world is treating the West like a pushy door to door salesman treats  a  home owner, without our slamming the door in their face in return. A while back I read a dynamite treatise on why aggressive beggars both here and there won`t leave our tourists alone, while leaving their own people unmolested. Wish I could find it again, it explained the whole thing quite well&hellip;</p>

		<p>A few years ago, a 15 year old French boy was kidnapped by three Arab men in Kuwait, forcibly sodomized, and when he complained to the police, was charged with homosexuality. Only an outcry by the French government resulted in prosecution of the offenders, who were NOT charged with homosexuality, but with some other offense.  (The are no muslim homosexuals, after all.)  This is another example of the insanity that exists in the muslim world, especially where sex is concerned.</p>

		<p>I guess what I really meant to say, minus the vulgarity of ripping clothes off innocent women, is that we are expected to adhere to their laws over there, while they expect us to adhere to their laws&hellip; over here?!? Not exactly what I would call diplomatic parity. Once again, I don`t think that insulting or victimizing their folks does any good, and I apologize to women everywhere but really, somethings got to give&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yes, yes, yes Middle Eastern Muslims are just like us!  Why all people everywhere are exactly the same.  Therefore, please encourage your politicians to keep importing millions of Muslims into our homelands.  We Westerners will benefit ever so much from their unique and colorful way of life. I can&rsquo;t wait until the day when the Muslims in my country reach 50 or 60% of the total population.  What an exciting time lies ahead for our children.  Thanks all you Leftist, multiculturalist politicians.  You are really looking out for us. </p>

		<p>While I feel sorry for the victim I believe that it is each person&rsquo;s responsibility to research the laws of the country they intend to visit. This is a common law in Muslim countries and rape is very rarely prosecuted since the woman is considered at fault. The Emirates are being promoted as the new hot vacation spot but they are still a muslim country and as such follow Islamic law. I would caution any single woman from visiting a Muslim country alone- a woman travelling without a male escort (either a husband or close relative) is considered fair game for sexual assault. </p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;In the UAE, rape is not a crime unless it is witnessed by four adult male Muslim witnesses.</i></p>
<p>Adultry accusations also require 4 male witnesses, not just rape.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Alicia wasn&rsquo;t told this. She certainly wasn&rsquo;t told that if she reported the brutal rape to the police that she ran the risk of being jailed for 12 months.</i></p>
<p>So Alicia has been living under a rock? With no access to news and absolutely no awareness of the laws/beliefs in foreign countries? Alicia didn&rsquo;t spend 10 minutes researching online before she decided to live in the middle east?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Alicia was merely told that she should &lsquo;reconsider her need to be in the country&rsquo; at that time.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Very wise advice indeed. It is a shame Alicia didn&rsquo;t take it.</p>

		<p>Because of pro-multiculturalism propaganda and the &#8216;all cultures are equal&rsquo; and &#8216;celebrate diversity paradigm&rsquo; that young western women are raised in they have been actively disarmed of or even suppress much of the natural skepticism they need to protect themselves from sexual assault. Nor do they look for the dangers of dealing with other cultures and races.  Doublethink is in play.</p>
<p>I think this is a small part of the reason we have such a massive problem of sexual assault on young White women by men of non European origin in Europe; not only are the White women targeted they themselves have been conditioned to ignore warning indications and have also been denied the crime statistics.</p>
<p>Could you imagine an government agency, such as the Australian Dept of Foreign affairs trying to issue a travel warning of the dangers of targeted sexual assault and discriminatory laws?</p>
<p>Incidentally, &#8220;The men involved were foreign nationals, they were not from the Middle East. Two were from India and one from Mauritius.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>A while back I read a dynamite treatise on why aggressive beggars both here and there won`t leave our tourists alone, while leaving their own people unmolested. </i></p>
<p>This is worth noting. They ONLY beg from white tourists and pester them for minutes at a time, sometimes surrounding them on the beaches of Asian countries. If you give money to one or two, they&rsquo;ll find you on your way to work. They learn enough English to beg for money, just to get five or ten bucks out of you   &mdash;   they don&rsquo;t even LOOK for their own kind, because their own kind will tell them to go to hell.</p>
<p>BACK ON TOPIC   &mdash;   </p>
<p>I am not surprised that Arab men molested this woman. What I am surprised at is that <b>these white women leave college thinking that the rest of the world is one big multicultural lovefest of enlightenment, and then they get drugged, raped and threatened with the lash if they report it.</b></p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the dealio. The west is &#8220;ecologically naive&#8221;. Look it up. It&rsquo;s an actual scientific term. We practice a form of universal justice in which we treat others the same as we treat ourselves. It&rsquo;s basically the &#8220;golden rule&#8221;. But other people don&rsquo;t follow the golden rule. They take the side of their own people no matter what. At some point we&rsquo;re going to have to stop being &#8220;fair&#8221; to those who refuse to reciprocate. We&rsquo;re going to have to. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll be destroyed.</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall Sonya posting on Amren before. And yet here &#8220;she&#8221; is commenting on two articles dealing with similar issues - sexual abuse of foreign women in the middle east. And in both comments she appears to <i>defend</i> it. I suspect Sonya&rsquo;s real name may be &#8220;Achmed&#8221;.</p>

		<p>William, I like your comment. </p>
<p>I find people are so hard on Alicia. I wonder how many other women have been raped in foreign countries who avoid making it public because they know that they will be the ones judged and criticised. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had non-western men openly use the race card to get to know me (i.e., I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me because I am Asian / Black / Muslim etc; You looked like a typical Aussie snob that would think she was too good for an Asian / Black / Muslim man).  You get the picture, it immediately snares you into that awful place where you are &#8216;looking like a racist&rsquo;, if you don&rsquo;t want to talk to them you are almost validating what they just accused you of, but if you do then you are possibly putting yourself at risk.</p>
<p>There really needs to be more open discussion about this.  I don&rsquo;t get the impression that Alicia was stupid, just more in a foreign country where everything was different and aware that people would see her automatically as a racist because the standard stereotype of white Australians is that they are racists, and she just wanted to make a positive impression.  </p>

<p>Muslim countries vary greatly when it comes to the treatment of women. Egypt is well known for harassing and even grabbing females on the streets in some cities. Conversely countries like Iran have very strict moral and behavioral codes; I spent 2 weeks in Iran as a single American woman and will say it is one of the safest countries in the world for women travelers. The men don&rsquo;t dare leer at women, much less ever touch them for any reason in public. Even the government officials waive the standard rules and go the extra mile to assist a female traveler.</p>

<p>  This is true under Sharia Law. Charges of rape are not prosecuted without four male eyewitnesses. The testimony of women in this important matter is not usually relevant in most Sharia Courts. Now let&rsquo;s hear the public indignation from American Gender Feminists&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. Oh, I forgot that they&rsquo;re more indignant over the lack of female Lacrosse teams in College sports. </p>

		<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t wish what happened to Miss Gali on anyone, unfortunately, when you go to these countries, you are playing with fire. Having served in the Middle East; I have little sympathy for these nagging harpies who whine and complain about every perceived slight against women. If you have it so bad in America, Australia, Europe, or a couple of other places; go live in Iran, Kuwait, or a couple of other places for a year or two. Also, check out the writings of a feminist writer named Phyllis Chesler. She was briefly married to a man from Afghanistan in the early 1960&rsquo;s. Let&rsquo;s just say that a dose of reality clears up a lot of PC. especially when you are a virtual prisoner. </p>
<p>We had some females in the unit that I served with in the Middle East. We were told that a few minor precautions saved a lot of trouble. For one, we did our best to insure that the women in our unit didn&rsquo;t drive off-base. That cuts way down on the Middle East version of &#8220;YOU WILL RESPECT MY AUTHORITY!!&#8221;. One of the first things we did when we arrived was to pull all of the women into a theater and inform them that &#8220;you&rsquo;re not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy&#8221;. While I can imagine some annoyances, avoiding jail, rape, and God only knows what else, was a small price to pay. </p>
<p>Give it a few years before the State of Michigan becomes the Caliphate of Michigan and I can see similar laws being enacted. By this time, the Supreme Court will probably go along with any outrageous laws demanded under Sharia law. Ladies, do you really want to go to your OB/GYN for an annual pap smear and have some pious Muslim male demanding to know your sexual history (if you are single)? He goes through your medical records and learns that you lost your virginity at 19 while away at college. Even if you are the member of a strict church; Dad may be upset when he learns the truth, but he isn&rsquo;t likely to kill you. However, under the new regime, you are informed that you can either pay a fine of a few thousand dollars or get 25 lashes. Although what you did at the time was not illegal, the Supreme Court has invalidated ex post facto laws in Michigan. If these people take over, stuff like this will happen. </p>

		<p>I`ve had non-Western men openly use the race card to get to know me&#8221;-Honey<br>
Best book I`ve read was called &#8220;The Gift of Fear.&#8221; In it, it decribes a woman who was raped and then goes back and details all the ruses thugs use to steer their victims. One I recall was &#8220;False Teamwork&#8221;. That would be when an assailant approaches a woman alone  at the bus stop and goes, &#8220;We missed the bus!! What do we do now?&#8221;  The correct response would be, &#8220;We`re NOT together!!  I DON`T know you!! My husband is coming, Leave me alone!!&#8221; <br>
 There is also an iconic description of a man who approaches a woman in a parking garage and announces, &#8220;You won`t talk to me cause I bet your a stuck up racist White lady.&#8221;  The book answers for the woman. &#8220;Damn right, I `m racist. When most women are raped or assaulted by minorities and when a GOOD NUMBER of those attacks take place at this time of night in a parking garage&hellip;&#8221; Anyway the book lets you know that not only is okay to listen to your fears, it`s also damn good business to take counsel of them&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>For Honey- What the guy did to you was called &#8220;Typecasting&#8221;  Intentionally insulting the woman to get her to talk to them in order to prove that they were wrong about you. Another trick is called &#8220;Loan Sharking&#8221;. That is giving unsolicited and unwanted help ( example, woman with groceries) in order to be able to pressure them for favors in return. These, and others are called pre-indicators, which gives you a good idea of their intent towards you. GET THE BOOK GET THE BOOK GET THE BOOK&hellip;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m dismayed that the &#8216;We can do no  wrong even when we go into hostile civilizations&rsquo; Western colonial mentality dominates AmRen. When Rod Blagojevich was lynched, Serbs at home &amp; abroad didn&rsquo;t care or when Serb mafiosi get into trouble abroad. Same in Russia when a Russian woman marries a Westerner and gets into trouble abroad. They dont care. Too bad AmRen exploits their daft traitor kin to score cheap sympathy like Poland is doing to Canada with the Dziekanski Incident. Google it. Shameful.</p>

<p>I reject what you say and chastise you for allowing yourself to be manipulated. Neither you nor any other woman has to explain yourself to anybody else. You don&rsquo;t have to explain or justify to some stranger why you are not interacting with them. The old &#8220;you won&rsquo;t talk/ date/ socialize with me because I&rsquo;m black/ Oriental, etc&#8221; is just crass manipulation to put you into a no-win situation. DON&rsquo;T PLAY THE GAME. Believe me they don&rsquo;t think any more of you for doing so. Always do what&rsquo;s right FOR YOU. What makes YOU feel comfortable. Never mind about these riffraff.</p>

		<p>I will stand by what I say about Muslim countries- unless you have a very good reason to travel to one I would stay away- far away! In fact most of the strictest Sharia using countries will not even issue a visa to a single woman. Saudi Arabia had real problems when Queen Elizabeth visited, it was finally decided that they would give her the designation of an &#8220;honorary male&#8221; so she could visit the kingdom. </p>
<p>The book &#8220;The Gift of Fear&#8221; is an excellent read for a college girl going away for the first time, single woman living alone or honestly any woman who has to venture outside her home alone. PC training in public (and increasingly private) schools make women feel bad if they reject affections or attention from a minority man. Girls need to be taught at a young age to stay away from minority men- other ethnic groups teach their daughters this and whites should be no different. You will prevent your daughters from a world of hurt and unhappiness if you teach her to date within her own ethnic or racial group. </p>

		<p>Tim McHugh - Thanks for the recommendation, I&rsquo;ve definitely going to buy the book. </p>
<p>Anon 22 - some people just don&rsquo;t have great social skills. Some of the behaviours I&rsquo;ve come across concern me because it is only after mulling over it I realise what was going on.  You never know what is going on in someone&rsquo;s life that they may be distracted, depressed, have too many problems and someone who is predatory targets them.  But you are right with what you are saying. <br>

<p>I am poster #10. I think you&rsquo;re right about Sonya posting other comments. I jumped the gun. My bad. But you&rsquo;re confused because the quote you attributed to her was part of <i>my</i> comment. I&rsquo;m glad we agree on those points. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll read her earlier comment however you&rsquo;ll see that she &#8220;blames the victim&#8221; for not being aware of UAE laws regarding rape. We obviously know about such things because a lot of us Amren readers are news junkies. But most people aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not irresponsible to assume most countries have reasonable laws prohibiting rape. Her lawsuit really is valid. If a woman is raped in a foreign country and goes to her embassy for help it really is incumbent upon them to say, &#8220;hey, the laws here are screwed up and they&rsquo;re going to charge you with adultery.&#8221; That&rsquo;s part of what the embassy is there for.</p>

		<p>Let me clear this up for those who may not know:</p>
<p>When you are in their country you do things (their way).</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>When they are here in our country you do things (their way).</p>
<p>Humm this fact of life doesn&rsquo;t sound quite right does it?</p>

<p>Yes, I am blaming the victim! She is not a child, she should have RESEARCHED the laws! She should have KNOWN you don&rsquo;t go to a conservative Muslim country, then start messing around with your male coworkers which leads to being &#8220;drugged and date raped&#8221; and rush to the police to complain about it!</p>
<p>She was NOT grabbed on the street then beaten and raped in a back alley. She was socializing/partying with male coworkers and got date raped! She should have KNOWN those charges are very serious in a Muslim country. She was incredibly ignorant, she put herself in that position via a series of very bad decisions and I do not feel sorry for her.</p>

<p>I generally agree with you. I can&rsquo;t for the very life of me understand why so many vulnerable foolish young white woman seem to go out of their way to place themselves in harm&rsquo;s way. ANY western woman who travels to a muslim country should be EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. I also don&rsquo;t get her suing the Australian government? (Which really means of course the Australian taxpayers). What did they do? They didn&rsquo;t attack her. From her look, I seriously doubt she would have paid any attention to a precautionary warning anyways. Probably would have scoffed it off as &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; or &#8220;racism&#8221;. Or &#8220;things like that only happen to other girls&#8221;, or some other nonsense. Some people learn only from experience, often very bitter ones. Nor was there anything stopping her from doing a little bit of research on the country BEFORE she went there. </p>

		<p>Any woman, married or single, who goes to an Islamic oountry willingly, needs their head examined.  Islam is antithetical to how women are treated in the western world. Islam condones raping of non-muslim women, raping of children, and the killing of any non-muslim.  They condone lying to non-muslims if it will advance Islam.  The West has been at war with Islam since its inception, only we take time off for decades.  They do not, will not, and cannot stop.  We will be in a global war inside of 2 decades.  10 years for the muj to consolidate power in the &#8220;caliphate&#8221; being built during the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221;, and to further infiltrate our societies.  10 years of softening us up with more terrorism, and then Katie Bar the Door. </p>
