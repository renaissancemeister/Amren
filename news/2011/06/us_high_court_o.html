			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Egelko, San Francisco Chronicle, June 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge Monday to a California law granting college tuition discounts to high school graduates in the state, regardless of immigration status  &mdash;  a law that saves illegal immigrants, among others, nearly $23,000 a year at UC campuses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the University of California, in-state fees total $11,300 a year, while non-Californians pay $34,000. The savings are $11,160 a year at California State University and $4,400 a year at the community colleges.</p>
<p>A group of 42 out-of-state residents paying the higher fees at California colleges said in a 2005 lawsuit that the statute violated a 1998 federal immigration law. That law prohibits states from providing any benefits to illegal immigrants based on their in-state residence, unless the state makes the same benefits available to U.S. citizens elsewhere.</p>
<p>But the state Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law in November, ruling that the lower fees were based on immigrant students&rsquo; high school graduation, and not merely on their residence in California.</p>
<p>It was the first ruling in the nation to address such a law. Eleven other states have similar statutes.</p>

		<p>Technically, this wasn&rsquo;t a SCOTUS ruling, this was them not granting cert.  And they did so without comment, so we&rsquo;re left here without any rhyme or reason from the bench why they thought they should have let the pro-illegal decision of the Appellate Court (9th Circus probably) stand.</p>

		<p>Well it looks like Obama didn&rsquo;t even need to appoint his wise Latina to help hasten the marginalization of those evil old white men. Since the decision was unanimous, looks like Scalia and some of our fellow whites have decided to do their small part to put the gun to our collective heads.</p>
<p>I sure wish I had seen this law coming. If I&rsquo;d known about it seven years ago I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered to join the military to gain GI Benefits, but rather would have legally immigrated to Mexico, renounced my American citizenship, and then snuck illegally across the border in order to enjoy this wonderful gift.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, ever seen student loan default rates, by race? If not, let me help you out. They sort of look like mortgage rate default rates, only even more pronounced. Still, there should be plenty of money in our national budget for this expense. It&rsquo;s not like we have a deficit or two wars, make that three, going on.</p>

		<p>All the more reason that Obama must be a one term president. If he continues to populate the federal courts with liberal judges, it is all over for Euro-Americans. </p>

		<p>So if I am a citizen of the U.S., and I move to California and go to a college, I will have to pay the full out-of-state tuition, but if I am an illegal alien, born in another country and sneak into California without permission, not only will I not get arrested and deported, but I get to pay in-state tuition?  My friends, truly the world is upside down.</p>

		<p>Is anyone truly surprised? This is California at its most generous. The powers-that-be are happy taking your money to give to those who laugh at our laws. What do the invaders have that we don&rsquo;t beside our money?</p>

<p>The illegals pay NOTHING. No &#8220;in-state tuition&#8221; whatsoever in CA now. The bankrupt state mysteriously came up with some new found MILLIONS for illegals exclusively to attend college. It isn&rsquo;t even a loan! It is FREE and they do not have to pay a dime back to the state.</p>

		<p>Those judges sure like giving away other peoples&rsquo; money.  I wonder if this only applies to illegals from Mexico. Can Canadians send their kids down to California to go to school too? </p>

		<p>To answer the question for #8, yes, it only applies to Mexicans (and other politically favored groups). The govt ignores/enforces laws on a selective basis depending on who you are. If Canadians started coming down here (California) with bogus residency documents and going to school, surely California would put a quick stop to that.</p>
<p>Oh, the Supreme Court - they&rsquo;re too timid to take on a controversial subject like this. Wait until the Obama care issue gets into their inbox. They will delay, ignore and finally favor it on some stupid interpretation of the law. Yeah, 5 conservatives, sure. My guess is 6-3 affirm.</p>

<p>Make that four. We&rsquo;re running air raids over Yemen, too. And, actually, counting Pakistan, it&rsquo;s five. Obama. The anti-war dude. </p>
