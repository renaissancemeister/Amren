<h1>Man Accused of Raping Girl 100 Times</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chicago Tribune, June 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shocking allegations of sexual abuse in Moreno Valley where police have arrested a man suspected of repeatedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>22-year old Alonso Ramon Pedro was arrested Sunday at his home on suspicion of more than 100 counts of sexual assault on a child.</p>
<p>Police say a 14-year-old neighbor told investigators that Pedro had broken into her bedroom several times since January and sexually assaulted her.</p>

		<p>LARAZA, MALDEF, ADL SPLC and the rest should sue the Chicago Tribune for their negativity on reporting hispanic indian rich and vibrant way of life.</p>
<p>Who are we to judge this man.  He is just acting according to his culture.  I&rsquo;m sure LARAZA and MALDEF will provide him with a female defense attorney from SPLC.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the parents notice their home was being repeatedly broken into and their daughter assaulted?  Because Daddy was AWOL, and Mommy was lying stoned/drunk on the couch every day.  Mommy may even have been trading the kid&rsquo;s sexual favors for drugs.</p>
<p>Cases like this usually mean a complete and utter abdication of responsibility on the part of the parents.  </p>

		<p>So which is it?  Several times, or over 100 times?  If only several times, why the over 100 counts?  If 100 counts, how is that possible if the jerk had broken into her bedroom only &#8220;several times&#8221;?  Something fishy here.  Sounds to me, and I&rsquo;m of course guessing, that he and she were having consensual sex, then she got mad at him for some reason and told all to the authorities.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Actually, she jumped the gun. Seventy times seven is 490! She should have waited 390 more times!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it once and I&rsquo;ll say it before. The ONLY way this is going to stop is if someone of high importance is either murdered or raped by one of these goons.</p>
<p>OR our economy continues to decline. </p>

		<p>Victims who are raped several times by the same perp usually don&rsquo;t &#8220;like it&#8221;. They are often groomed and manipulated by the rapist&hellip;especially if the victims are children. They are easily brainwashed and scared into submission. For younger children, they might tell them &#8220;you had better do as I say, or I&rsquo;m going to tell your parents what you did&#8221;. For somewhat older kids, they might threaten to hurt or kill one of their loved ones. Even if it is consensual, it is rape. The adult uses their sophistication&hellip;well, cave man sophistication in this case, to manipulate and take advantage of a naive child. I hope that guy rots in one of our horrible California prisons.</p>

<p>***********************<br>
  I have a feeling Bill is probably closer to the mark in this case. It could be one of the parents walked in and she hollered rape. It is also possible the girl&rsquo;s parents are calling it rape (well, it IS statutory rape) and not the girl in question.<br>
 <br>
  I did Google &#8220;Moreno Valley gang rape in park&#8221;. This was a horrific case of a mentally disabled 11-year-old, lured into a park bathroom and gang raped by several suspected gang members. That is utterly despicable, and hardly the same thing as a 14-year-old with hot pants. <br>
 <br>
  If the 14 year old really WAS raped, she has my sympathies, but she had ample opportunity to make outcry during the months this was happening. No matter the circumstances, the offender should be strung up by his gonads and left to dry in the hot California sun.</p>

		<p>Imagine that: A paper in Chicago reporting  a crime 1600 miles away in the California desert.</p>
<p>I saw no mention of this in SoCal   &mdash;   not surprising since this is <i>so common here</i> among these people.</p>
<p>In Mexico and Central America:  <i>Sex with a minor is only a crime if the child is &#8216;honest&rsquo; and &#8216;chaste&rsquo;, and in many states the age of consent is 12, 13, 14 or &#8216;at puberty&rsquo; regardless of age.</i> </p>
<p>The girl didn&rsquo;t report the rapes because she was told this type of behavior in men is normal and to be expected.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the parents were well aware that this was going on in their own home to their own 14-year old daughter   &mdash;   when she becomes pregnant, the man will &#8216;take her&rsquo; and there will be one less mouth to feed.  Repeat ad infinitum and ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Is this the attitude we are importing into the USA to save ten cents on a head of lettuce?</p>
<p>Apparently so, according to the msm, academia and government.</p>

		<p>For this lowlife, a noose snapping his neck like a twig couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer guy or nearly soon enough. Sex offenders are lower than whale feces in the scheme of things, and these Hispanic invaders are often child molesters and rapists.</p>

		<p>Ironic how the Chicago Tribune will post a stunning mug shot of a minority (as if one had to guess with just a name) committing felonies in California (but who probably never committed a crime against a hard copy reader of the Tribune) on the one hand, yet all the murauding thugs in the streets of Chicago are faceless and descriptionless &#8220;teens&#8221; or &#8220;youths&#8221;.</p>

		<p>My guess is that this case is not &#8220;rape&#8221; in the traditional sense if the &#8220;100&#8221; counts thing indicates what it seems it would.  </p>
