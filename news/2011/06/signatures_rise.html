			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Wagner, Washington Post, June 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Organizers of an effort to repeal a Maryland law granting college tuition breaks to illegal immigrants said Wednesday that they have collected 62,496 signatures to force a public vote  &mdash;  a significantly higher number than an estimate provided 24 hours before.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, leaders of the group MDPetitions.com said they were prepared to turn in more than 40,000 signatures to meet an initial deadline established by law. But the batch they turned into the secretary of state shortly before midnight Wednesday grew considerably, they said.</p>
<p>If all the signatures claimed Wednesday are founded to be valid, the group will have met the threshold for putting the law on hold and calling a statewide referendum on the issue in November 2012.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law, signed this month by Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley (D), would allow students who are illegal immigrants to pay the lower in-state rates at the state&rsquo;s colleges and universities. To be eligible, students must have attended a Maryland high school for three years, provide proof that their parents are taxpayers and express their intent to become a citizen.<br>

						<p><small><i>Neil Parrott, Baltimore Sun, May 31, 2011</i></small></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When considering our existing immigration laws, it is absurd to even think about hard-working Marylanders subsidizing in-state tuition benefits to illegal aliens, which the Maryland legislature voted this year to do.</p>
<p>Although the bill passed, I can assure you that there was bipartisan opposition to this bill in both the House of Delegates and the state Senate. The liberal leaders in the Democratic majority applied pressure to get the bill through, but even so, it barely passed. The vote in the House was 74-65, with more than 20 Democrats voting against the legislation.</p>
<p>Not only does this bill further encourage illegal aliens to migrate to Maryland, but we simply cannot afford it. The fiscal note attached to the bill indicated that the costs to the state will reach an additional $4 million annually.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}. In-state tuition is not just a nice benefit; it uses Maryland tax dollars to cover more than half the cost of college tuition.<br>

		<p>There are quite a few citizens of the People&rsquo;s Republic of Maryland that are against this including liberals and Blacks.  Maryland has quite a few budget issues and this is just insanity!!  I signed the petition and so did many of my friends and family.  I have to thank an unknown Amren poster for the info on where to find the petition online.  </p>

		<p>Paying attention, Republicans?  If this kind of &#8220;anti-immigrant&#8221; petition can get 62,000 sigs in Maryland of all states, then it can probably pass once it makes it to the ballot.  And if that can happen, then Maryland is not beyond the pale for a Republican Presidential candidate.  But the Republicans will have to do better than a field of announced and potential Presidential candidates whose average Numbers USA immigration grade is D-Minus.  (And since NUSA can be a bit &#8220;charitable,&#8221; because they fail to grok the H-xB visa issue, that D-Minus average is probably more like an F average).  The best grade is Michele Bachmann&rsquo;s B-Minus, but a B-Minus grade is basically &#8220;the curve.&#8221;  And she is problematic, because she&rsquo;s another twit like Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin who believes in those mysterious &#8220;black founding fathers&#8221; that all the liberals who run history departments in academia have not yet been able to find, and she said the &#8220;God wants her to run for President&#8221; (cuckoo, cuckoo, get back on your meds).</p>

		<p>Such schemes to give in state tuition to illegal immigrants is wrong because US citizens of other states who want to go to school in MD have to pay out of state tuition while illegals who live there can pay instate rates. AB 340 the California bill that allows illegals to pay in state tuition rates, is one reason why California is broke today but no politician there has the nerve to introduce a bill to end this practice.</p>

		<p>Instead of the &#8220;The Dream Act&#8221; and its various incarnations at state levels forcing most Americans to support something they don&rsquo;t want, we should instead have a voluntary form where Americans could sign up for support of illegal immigrants in college, medical care, etc if they are in favor of such things, but if they do, they must provide their own bank account information or credit card # so that a monthly fee could be charged (the costs of administering the program divided amongst those who register). See how many liberals and gov&rsquo;t officials actually support it when it comes out of their own pockets instead of everyone else&rsquo;s. </p>

<p>You are right about all those Republican twits. I used to vote Republican no matter what, but I will no longer. Every single one they are pushing, (including Herman Cain, their black token) is another reason I will not vote for them. I will vote 3rd party because the two we have is one and the same. NOTHING will change for White folk as long as the 2-party system is in place. They both sold us out a long time ago.</p>

		<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned -any- intervention in education is merely a sop (think highway money) to begin a process of &#8216;diversification dependency&rsquo; within the higher academia.</p>
<p>I wonder what the status of our collegiate systems really are (i.e. how many college capable and intentful high school grads we are actually producing) if we are filling seats with illegals&hellip;</p>

<p>A &#8220;B-&#8221; is pretty good compared to all the other candidates out there.  Your telling me you won&rsquo;t vote for Michelle Bachmann because she&rsquo;s a Christian even though she has a good rating on immigration?  No candidate is going to get elected without the blessing of the Christian right.  Forget Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin is too much of a media buffoon to take seriously.  Herman Cain is a joke candidate and if he were White the people now fawning over him would have ignored him.  I used to support Ron Paul but the more I know about him the less I like him.  He supports openly gay people in the military and the legalization of drugs.  He&rsquo;s for more immigration and more &#8220;free trade&#8221; which is the last thing we need right now.  I like some of his ideas including ending the Federal Reserve but too many of his issues are to the left and I saw a clip of him appearing on &#8220;The View&#8221; vying for the secular progressive, homosexual, militant feminist vote.  I don&rsquo;t even want to be in the same room with someone who watches that vile garbage much less support the same candidate they do. Unless someone better comes along, Bachmann has my vote.  </p>

<p>Read what I wrote again. You know I didn&rsquo;t say that I wouldn&rsquo;t support Bachmann because she is a Christian.  First off, nothing in her statement about &#8220;God wants me to run&#8221; implies that she professes Christianity, because you don&rsquo;t need to be a Christian per se in order to think that.  You could be Jewish, a Deist, or adhere to other faiths.  It&rsquo;s just that we both know she is, so you made that implication about my mindset.</p>
<p>I actually oppose that kind of rhetoric because I&rsquo;m a serious Christian.  The very last admonition in the New Testament basically warns us not to put words in God&rsquo;s mouth or take them out of God&rsquo;s mouth.  For Michele Bachmann to say that &#8220;God wants me to run for the Presidency&#8221; is either delusional, sociopathic, psychopathic, or lying.  And definitely un-Christian.</p>
<p>That said, if the choice is Michele Bachmann or Barack Obama, easily the former.  ONLY because she is white.</p>
<p><i>No candidate is going to get elected without the blessing of the Christian right.</i></p>
<p>And if the &#8220;Christian right&#8221; is truly Christian, they would agree with my mindset that people shouldn&rsquo;t put words in God&rsquo;s mouth.  But if all it takes to get their support is to say such things, then they&rsquo;re the biggest schmucks in the American body politic.</p>
<p>If the &#8220;Christian Right&#8221; is so powerful, then explain how John Sidney McCain III won the Republican nomination in 2008.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Christian Right is an important factor in Republican Party politics.  But I think there&rsquo;s an easier and cleaner way to get their support.  Another topic for another time.</p>
<p><i>I used to support Ron Paul but the more I know about him the less I like him.</i></p>
<p>Good timing on your part   &mdash;   He and Bachmann have something in common   &mdash;   Bachmann is a tax attorney, and is therefore someone who should have enough intelligence not to believe or say ignorant things like &#8220;God wants me to run for President&#8221; or believe in these mysterious Beck/Palin &#8220;black founding fathers&#8221; that the liberals who run university history departments would have been trumpeting for decades if they existed.  She can do a lot of good in Congress given a certain set of duties and responsibilities.  And Ron Paul is another one   &mdash;   Doesn&rsquo;t he have an important subcommittee to run?  He now has the power to subpoena and fry people like Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner, something which would have been unfathomable in the 1990s.  RP should do more of that and less of his quixotic Presidential campaign.</p>
<p><i>He&rsquo;s for more immigration and more &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; which is the last thing we need right now. I like some of his ideas including ending the Federal Reserve but too many of his issues are to the left and I saw a clip of him appearing on &ldquo;The View&rdquo; vying for the secular progressive, homosexual, militant feminist vote.</i></p>
<p>There is a theory going around in libertarian circles that the left-libertarians have Ron Paul&rsquo;s ear.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why someone who claims to be a Christian would be so quick to point out that other religions believe in a god as well. Also, as a serious Christian you might want to read that New Testament passage again because it says that no one should take away or add to the prophecies in the book (Bible). I will reiterate, no candidate will get ELECTED if they don&rsquo;t get approval from the Christian right.  </p>
<p>Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter who gets in office at this point.  Too many of the problems in this country don&rsquo;t seem like they can be solved by politics alone.  There is a spiritual, moral, economic and cultural decline that&rsquo;s been going on for nearly 30 years that I can remember.  There&rsquo;s also complete lack of standards in this country anymore and people seem to be a lot less educated than they once were.  I don&rsquo;t think there is any historical precedent for a country in decline to suddenly rejuvenate itself but I hope I&rsquo;m wrong.     </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how it plays out&hellip;</p>
<p>1. Citizens sign petition to put referendum on ballot to outlaw giving in-state tuition to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>2. The referendum makes it to the ballot.</p>
<p>3. The referendum passes by a wide margin.</p>
<p>4. ACLU sues next day.</p>
<p>5. Corrupt left wing judge blocks law with immediate injunction.</p>
<p>6. Years go by as case winds through court, eventually making it to the SCOTUS, where it may or may not be preserved with a 5-4 vote.  </p>
<p>If the referendum is judged unconstitutional by what will surely be some idiotic premise that only a fathead lawyer could understand, people will grow to hate their government more and more and more and more.</p>

<p>Even liberals will eventually need to look after their own interests because any kind of pro-nonwhite legislation they enact<br>
further erodes their power. Blacks, hispanics and orientals don&rsquo;t care about liberalism and one worlderism.  They&rsquo;re highly ethnocentric and once they gain an upper hand against them they&rsquo;ll turn on them because they won&rsquo;t need them anymore.  That&rsquo;s why so many of these liberals are trying to rebrand themselves under the Republican Party as &#8220;conservative gays&#8221;, pro-abortion and &#8220;compassionate conservatism&#8221;.  They&rsquo;ve boxed themselves into a corner from which there is no escaping.  If conservatives would simply maintain some ideological purity and keep all this garbage out these people eventually be marginalized.   </p>

		<p>Number #18 was spot on. People can sign petitions, vote, make laws (that won&rsquo;t be enforced), complain, and start any kind of drive to turn things around, but all it takes is some idiot in a robe to say &#8220;no&#8221;. That happened last year here in Calif. when the homosexual judge said no to the ballot initiative against gay marriage that passed. That&rsquo;s the second time, and it&rsquo;s just not going to happen. </p>
<p>Anything that the left wing doesn&rsquo;t like is not going to happen mainly because they are strongly united, and use any means necessary to get what they want, hook or by crook. </p>
<p>In contrast, traditional conservative people have the attitude &#8220;win some loose some&#8221; or &#8220;let&rsquo;s use the system&#8221; or &#8220;let&rsquo;s try harder next time&#8221; but find that they are playing by totally different rules. Left wing leaning people can really be brutal, and use anything from illegal voting, personal attacks, judge selecting, intimidation, payoffs, bribes and so forth. They are really hell bent in what they believe regardless of the fallacy of their arguments. NOW THAT IS WHY THEY WIN. Sorry to say. </p>

<p>I suppose in the interests of fairness, I should say something nice about Michele Bachmann.  She did vote for the more strongly worded and more explicitly anti-bellicose Kucinich resolution to withdraw from Libya.  Allen West, too.  (Compared to the weaker Bohener resolution).  The WSJ read the 87 Republicans who voted for the Kucinich resolution the Riot Act today.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s significant because I have used these forums, James Edwards&rsquo;s blog and my own blog to heap a lot of opprobrium on Bachmann and West lately, so give the &#8220;devils&#8221; their due.  Really, they do good jobs as members of Congress, but they along with Ron Paul should focus on their Congressional jobs instead of mounting quixotic and possibly counter-productive Presidential campaigns.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want West running the House Armed Services Committee, (which a lot of his fans think he should do if he never runs for President), because he had to have benefited from affirmative action as he rose through the enlisted and officer ranks in the Army, he surely did benefit from lamestream conservative political affirmative action to become a Congressman and a &#8220;revered&#8221; national figure, so as chairman of the HASC, he would be true to himself and force even more AA on the military.</p>
<p>Another item of significance from the 87 Rs that voted with Kucinich is that most of them thought we had a compelling national interest to go into Iraq, which we didn&rsquo;t, yet if they can see that there is no redeeming qualities in getting involved in Libya, then that speaks volumes.  Remember, Obama&rsquo;s launching pad versus HRC was the anti-war position.  Now, Obama wants to be in Libya.</p>

		<p>Here are some points that must be considered, with the scourge of illegal immigration? We should amend the 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Bill, signed by the late President Reagan. So there is an expeditious visa authority to allow the highest concentrations of highly skilled workers. So Instead of our brain drain through American companies going overseas, we bring in these job seekers. Our biggest problem of this century is not stopping illegal immigration, as although we need top notch professional workers, we must do everything in our power to stop the stream of endless poverty. Not mediocre job seekers, from India and other low income countries from abroad, but the people who have amassed verifiable science degrees in engineering or computer technology. People who will not become a weighted down welfare recipient, or need public assistance to survive.</p>
<p>The farm worker dilemma after the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli bill was rampant with fraud, which eventually cost US taxpayers 73 billion dollars amid an extra 4 million people subsisting on welfare entitlements. After these people staked their amnesty claim, they disappeared and turned up in the main job market. The main loser was the farmers and agriculture. I don&rsquo;t think the politicians in Washington have any idea, if another amnesty was made the law of the land? The 11 million we supposedly have in the illegal alien population, within months would materialize into 20 million plus? Can you imagine the mounting financial burden of legalizing these numbers? If it was 73 billion dollars, just after 1986, can anybody estimate the cost today?</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a non- profit, that it would cost tax payers through future years at least $ 2.6 TRILLION DOLLARS.</p>
<p>In a nation going broke and proportionately owned by Communist China, wealthy Arabs and other rich investors? While our manufacturing industry closes down for good, locations like China are stealing our dollars through marketing cheap goods. American corporations in Mexico and other foreign countries, are using the CAFTA and NAFTA treaties, are also stealing our children&rsquo;s futures. I cannot understand the mentality of these treaty negotiators; a blind monkey could do better? We owe more money to the rest of the world, than ever before; we are the debtor instead of the lender. It&rsquo;s difficult even to understand the magnitude of $14.5 Trillion dollars and yet this country is still importing poverty, because our borders remain porous?</p>
<p>We need strong, unbending attitudes of people as Rep. Lou Bartlett whose previous legislation would have finally put an end to any facet of Amnesty, masquerading as Immigration Reform and current laws as E-Verify. This was the real substance of upheaval that opened the dam, on the rising consequences of illegal immigration and the expenditures of small towns like Hazleton, Pennsylvania. It was renounced by the administration who filed a lawsuit. However the Supreme Court has deliberated, informing the 3rd Circuit Court in PA of appeals to reconsider the case. As for the Supreme court  rejecting  a law that will stop illegal alien students from getting  in-state tuition.  I think a massive battle  is  building in  America that is about to explode,  with likely civil unrest .</p>
<p>Today, the people who are coming here illegally are economic aliens; with past and today&rsquo;s governments ignoring the damaging outcome. Not only are these new sweeping economical aliens here, with their hands out, but they are stealing money through giant loopholes in the tax refund system. As an addition more than $40 billion dollars is transferred to foreign banks every year. It scares me where either the Liberal-Democrats or the Republicans are taking us? I cannot even afford to send my autistic son to college, but the children of illegal aliens are getting in State tuition, in many academic institutions. My now deceased Independent grandmother couldn&rsquo;t even have her dentures repaired some years back in California, but the children of illegal aliens get free education, free health care, free breakfast and lunch at; all the family has more monetary privileges than citizens, especially if you conceive a child will squatting here.</p>
<p>Of those illegal immigrants who pay taxes using the ITIN, to feel more secure, collects most of it back in refunds. This country is deterioration fast, because of spending on people who have no right to even be here. For me and millions of patriotic Americans, no matter your race or religion the TEA PARTY is our only hope? Illegal immigration has become a major impediment in our social entitlement system, so we must fight this tumor that is eating away at common sense. It&rsquo;s my hope that Michelle Bachmann steps into ring, realizing she is going to be attacked on all fronts by our shadow government, the George Soros&rsquo;s and the fanatics who wants world government and open borders.</p>
<p>IS THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER EXPECTED TO PAY FOR EVERY &#8220;ECONOMIC&#8221; ILLEGAL ALIEN, FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?</p>
<p>Attn: The Arizona Senate has defied the majority of the American people, THE TEA PARTY and stripped the 14th Amendment, instant citizenship law from moving towards the Supreme Court. By deliberately not addressing this gaping loophole, Congress in effect rewards law-breakers and punishes those who have chosen to follow the rules and immigrate legally. We expect it from the leftist and the democrats, but all will be intensely remembered in 2012, or whenever they come up for re-election. This is a hundred billion dollar Ponzi scheme, even bigger than Bernard Madoff could ever imagine.</p>
<p>IS THERE NOT A REAL AMERICAN STATE LEADER THAT WILL EMBRACE THIS PART OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT, AND FAST TRACK IT TO THE SUPREME COURT? WHERE ARE THE REAL POLITICIANS AND NOT THE CLOWNS?</p>
<p>Estimates are around 300.000 babies annually are intentionally born to illegal aliens, so they hope not to get deported. Taxpayers need to yell at their incompetence and frightening aspect of reneging on the instant citizenship going to the justices.</p>
<p>WHY SHOULD AMERICAN CITIZENS AND LEGAL RESIDENTS BE FORCED TO PAY FOR BABIES OF ILLEGAL PARENTS? OUR US CONSTITUTION IS BEING TRAMPLED INTO THE DIRT, BY BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES.</p>
<p>This is the exact tumult that began 1776 War of Independence? &#8220;TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION?&rdquo; THIS IS YOUR MONEY THEY ARE SPENDING.<br>

		<p>I see CA sent out notices to those disabled that their disability (SSI/SSA) checks were going to be cut another $35 a month, and a little over a year ago they cut it $67 a month within 2 months of each other. I expect in another month or two they will send another notice that they are going to take another $30 on top of that. This hits close to home since I have one of my adult kids that is disabled. He can barely pay rent, electric, phone, buy his bus pass and eat as it is and now this again. These people do not qualify for food stamps since they get &#8220;help&#8221; from the state with their SSI which they keep taking away down to almost nothing (took away $97 in a year) and they still cannot get food stamps so they can at least eat! </p>
<p>Yet CA sure did find MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS, a month or so ago, to pay for ILLEGALS to go to college! I am so angry I cannot see straight! They NEVER cut from welfare because most are all nonwhites who have kid after kid by different men in most cases, and they get FS and WIC and section 8! We keep paying for these unfit people to reproduce and raise unfit children, for the most part, who will be a drain on us forever.  </p>
<p>I have noticed this trend of late where they attack seniors and disabled by cutting $$$ and medical help, because they know most are White people and they have little to live on and can&rsquo;t &#8220;riot&#8221; like the welfare nonwhites do at the drop of the hat.</p>
<p>So tell me, this is not going to get worse for ALL of us White people.</p>

		<p>Take away the blacks/Dems in Baltimore City and Prince Georges County, and you have what could be considered a pretty conservative state   &mdash;   think Eastern Shore, Western Maryland mountains, etc. Unfortunately, the Dem machine and the blacks have a stranglehold on the votes in those two places. </p>
