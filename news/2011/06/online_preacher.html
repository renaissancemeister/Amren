			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), June 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Operating from Yemen, the US-born Islamic preacher has been dubbed the &#8216;bin Laden of the internet&rsquo; having been linked to numerous extremists charged with terrorism offences in Britain and elsewhere.</p>
<p>He has lived in Britain and America, speaks to his followers in impeccable English over the internet and is one of the key figures of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsular (AQAP).</p>
<p>Awlaki gave advice to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the suspected Detroit bomber, who tried to blow himself up using a device in his underpants on Christmas Day 2009.</p>
<p>US security sources have reportedly said there is &#8220;concrete evidence&#8221; that Awlaki recruited Abdulmutallab, who lived in Britain while studying at University College London.</p>
<p>Material gathered at UK properties linked to Abdulmutallab  &mdash;  who is being held in the US on terrorism charges  &mdash;  allegedly suggests he was an avid follower of Awlaki&rsquo;s blog and website.</p>
<p>Most recently, Awlaki has been linked to Rajib Karim, the former British Airways graduate trainee, who planned to smuggle a bomb onto a transatlantic flight.</p>
<p>Karim communicated online with Awlaki to orchestrate plans to attack the airline&rsquo;s infrastructure and detonate a bomb on a passenger plane.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old, who worked in BA&rsquo;s IT department after coming to Britain from Bangladesh, had applied for a cabin crew position in the hope that he could carry explosives aboard a flight to the US.</p>
<p>MI5 discovered his plans after investigating the British links of Awlaki.</p>
<p>Awlaki questioned Karim about security procedures at BA during a series of internet exchanges in January and February last year.</p>
<p>In one response, Karim told Awlaki: &#8220;I can work with the bros [sic] to find out the possibilities of shipping a package to a US  &mdash;  bound plane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karim was jailed for 30 years in March after admitting a string of terrorism charges and being found guilty of four counts of preparing to commit acts of terrorism or assisting others to do so.</p>
<p>Awlaki quotes from Dickens, dismisses Shakespeare and David Attenborough, and recently declared: &#8220;Jihad is becoming as American as apple pie and as British as afternoon tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in New Mexico, he grew up in Yemen and moved to the US to study civil engineering in Colorado and a master&rsquo;s degree in education.</p>
<p>He preached at mosques in San Diego and Virginia where he was considered conservative.</p>
<p>After September 11, however, it emerged that three of the hijackers had attended his mosques and one investigator said he believed Awlaki was their &#8220;spiritual adviser&#8221;.</p>
<p>Awlaki built up a base of extremist followers while living in London for two years until 2004 giving lectures at mosques, universities and closed study circles.</p>
<p>He developed a following among terrorists, including the July 7, July 21 and trans-Atlantic airline bombers.</p>
<p>He has also been linked to Major Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 people in a rampage at the Fort Hood military base in Texas in November last year. Faisal Shahzad, who tried to set off a car bomb in Times Square, New York, said he was influenced by the preacher.</p>
<p>He has also been mentioned in recent speeches by the heads of MI5 and MI6. Sir John Sawers, the chief of MI6, described Awlaki as an &#8220;al-Qaeda leader&#8221; who &#8220;broadcasts propaganda and terrorist instruction over the internet&#8221;. Jonathan Evans, the director general of MI5, said of Awlaki: &#8220;His influence is all the wider because he preaches and teaches in English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awlaki&rsquo;s sidekick, an American named Samir Khan, is also of significant concern because of the slick online magazine he produces called Inspire, which has articles such as &#8220;how to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is the inspiration the pair are offering to &#8220;lone wolf&#8221; operators that is causing MI5 and MI6 concern.</p>

		<p>In between Soros funded news, Atlanta&rsquo;s public TV station broadcasts something called Mohammad Scholars (blacks are now brilliant Arab mathematicians?)and a local black mosque.</p>
<p>The angry black Imam likes to yell to a very receptive and eager audience that &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t come here voluntarily, but God sent us here to take over everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>If you think that Whitey will rise up in fear and defend his White wife and daughter, just remember, a healthy humanity who would defend against the coming assault wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed things to get this bad by permitting or encouraging the empowering of hate-filled minorities to institutionalize hostile and dangerously anti-white systemic structures of power.</p>
<p>Do you still expect that we will see the rise of a hereditary chieftain around whom we will rally and fight?   Hasn&rsquo;t happened yet- won&rsquo;t happen ever.  Rick Perry is politician.  As soon as his power is threatened by his conservative rhetoric, he&rsquo;ll turncoat faster than our once-honorable, now disgraced former Segregation guv&rsquo;nahs.<br/>

		<p>Sorry, Jupiter, for stealing your thunder, but this article is the ideal corroboration for your axiom:  If the 1965 immigration &#8220;reform&#8221; in the U.S. and the late 1940s immigration acts in Britain didn&rsquo;t happen, nothing in this article would have ever happened, including 9/11 and 7/7.</p>
<p>This article is a bit disturbing in that its tone of prose seems to be more disturbed about the aforementioned radical Islamists&rsquo; &#8220;extremism&#8221; rather than the fact that they&rsquo;re a non-white alien presence in both countries.  In other words, the Telegraph wants us to get worked up about &#8220;extremism&#8221; in a generic sense, rather than the identities of any of its practitioners.</p>

<p>You have my permission to steal my thunder as often as you wish.</p>
<p>The Liberal ideology requires everyone to believe that this muslim foreigner-14th admendemnet notwithstanding-is interchangeable with a banjo playing Appalachian Native Born White American. Bold-face lying at its most extreme.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind what id the fundamental driving force of race-replacement immigration policy. The low wage labor policy of the Greedy Cheating Liberal Corporate Elites drives the policy of race-replacement. If you believe their propaganda, &#8220;We&#8221; had to import this Muslim terrorist&rsquo;s immigrant parents, for otherwise, White Americans would be worse off..after all, where would the nations engineers,doctors and computr programmers come from. It is shocking to me that millions of Native Born White Americans tolerate this massive level of treason.</p>
<p>9/11 coud never have happened if the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had not been passed, and if America had a national origins immigration policy in place that completely excluded Muslims. Moreover, the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget could have been cut back by 90 percent and America would have been a much safer place to live in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Jared Taylor wrote something like this in his new book&hellip;if he didn&rsquo;t, he should have. We must always go to the heart of the issue. No more beating around the bush.</p>

		<p>Jupiter7- You mention the Liberal Corporate types. MOST of the greedy corporate types are only liberal in one sense. Liberal capitalism extremists. In other words, the markets can do no wrong. No regulations on any of the financial sectors. Ah, I&rsquo;ve got news for the hundreds of millions of working-class Euro-blooded types the world over&hellip; Capitalism is going to be a thing of the past. Even China can&rsquo;t grow forever. They have a huge middle class now, but the majority of that country is currently &amp; always will be 3rd world. It has to. There are no more windfalls for the 800 million poor rural farmers in that nation. No Goldman Sachs bailout coming because it is unsustainable. It would be economic suicide to subsidize what little aerable land is left over there. </p>
<p>Which is why they are recolonizing Africa. This time it won&rsquo;t be the White man&rsquo;s fault, but they despise the Asians just as much as us. The big difference is that there will be no &#8220;Asian guilt&#8221; on the part of China. It will get ugly.</p>
