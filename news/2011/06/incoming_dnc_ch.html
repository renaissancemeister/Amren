			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR, June 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Shultz (D-FL) denounced Republicans for thinking that illegal immigration should &#8220;in fact be a crime.&#8221;  (Fox News, May 31, 2011)  The incoming chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee told listeners that Democrats want &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; and that the 12 million illegal aliens currently in the U.S. are &#8220;a necessity&#8221; for the economy.  She then said that the general &#8220;Republican solution &hellip; in the last three years is that we should just pack them all up and ship them back to their own countries and that in fact it should be a crime and we should arrest them all.&#8221; That, she said, is what Rep. Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s 2005 legislation proposed.</p>
<p>Rep. Wasserman-Shultz may be dismayed to learn that illegal immigration is, in fact, already a crime.  As codified in 8 U.S.C. § 1325, federal law provides that an alien who unlawfully enters the United States is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in prison.  (See also INA § 275(a))  Second and subsequent offenses are felonies, punishable by up to two years in prison. (Id.)  Moreover, federal law provides that any alien who is present in the U.S. in violation of the law is deportable and &#8220;shall be removed&#8221; subject to an order.  (See generally 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) and (B); INA § 237(a)(1)(A) and (B))</p>
<p>Wasserman-Shultz may also be embarrassed to learn that Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner&rsquo;s 2005 immigration bill (H.R.4437) proposed nothing that would have altered the fact that illegal entry is a crime.  What H.R.4437 addressed was visa overstays, which account for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the illegal alien population in the U.S.  Federal law provides that overstaying one&rsquo;s visa is only a civil offense, not a criminal offense.  (See generally INA § 222(g) and § 212(a)(9)(B))  By proposing criminal penalties for overstaying one&rsquo;s visa, and thus being unlawfully present in the U.S., H.R.4437 sought to put one violation of the law on par with the other. (See H.R.4437 § 203)</p>

		<p>Even a cursory reading at black-oriented sites like &#8220;Griot&#8221; and <br>
&#8220;The Root&#8221; shows that staunchly democrat blacks still don&rsquo;t understand that in endorsing black (and white) politicians who defend illegals, they&rsquo;re cutting off their nose to spite their face.</p>
<p>Look at black unemployment figures. They&rsquo;re twice the white ones. And since blacks generally have less education, many of them will be in dire need of the jobs no American supposedly wants. All they&rsquo;re doing is helping to import competition. </p>
<p>Consider also that previously eradicated diseases such as drug-resistant TB are making a large comeback from south of the Border. Not only are blacks more reckless sexually (see CDC data) but they tend to live in closer proximity to Hispanics than Whites generally do.</p>
<p>So why, you may ask, if Hispanics are only going to harm black employment prospects and literally threaten their lives, would blacks continue to support politicians in favor of this policy? Simple, they still can&rsquo;t let go of the erroneous idea that some magical brown-black coalition is going to form to forever marginalize the white man. Hispanics might end up eclipsing whites, but not until long after they&rsquo;ve devoured blacks and driven them from the West and Southwest.</p>

		<p>I was amazed, yet not totally surprised that this woman didn&rsquo;t know that being an &#8220;illegal&#8221; alien in this country is a crime. Then I saw the photo beneath the article. Her eyes remind me of windows in a vacant building&hellip; nothing behind them. And she&rsquo;s the party chairwoman?!<br>
    Just further proof that libs operate solely on a neurotic emotional level. A second grader knows the definition of the word &#8220;illegal&#8221;! And these people fancy themselves our intellectual superiors. Simultaneously hilarious and pathetic!</p>

		<p>Looking at this picture, you can just hear this woman going &#8220;Duh-h-h!&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, I couldn&rsquo;t blame anyone for being confused about this. With the way our &#8220;leaders&#8221; and the media behave in this country, an outsider might certainly think that the question of whether people should simply be allowed to waltz into a country whenever they wanted was still up in the air  &mdash;  that after over 200 years as a nation, we somehow had not gotten around to deciding on this issue yet! </p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that every country on earth exercises its right to enforce its borders and it is, in fact, what defines a nation. The right to enforce ones borders is the very thing that defines a civilization. Yet now that this country has descended into madness, you&rsquo;d think it was a question that was still up in the air.</p>
<p>So normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame anyone for being confused about this. But since this woman is the incoming chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee and therefore the enemy, I blame her completely.</p>

<p>WILL YOU, PLEASE STOP WITH THESE LIES????</p>
<p>It has been 12 million illegals now for 12 years or more! Come on, think we still believe that LIE?<br>
 <br>
Also how can they be a &#8220;necessity&#8221; to our economy when they COST US billions more for their unneeded arrival here? We sure do see how well our economy is doing with the tens of millions of illegals here, don&rsquo;t we?  Guess she hasn&rsquo;t heard about the dollar collapsing soon and our economy is in ruins and our DEBT is so far gone that it can never be brought under control. ALL States filled with illegals are going bankrupt (wonder why?) or haven&rsquo;t you heard that either, Debbie&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>By the looks of your picture, you are as stupid as you look. Why do liberals have that &#8220;look&#8221;?&hellip;.like they are souless.</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s right.  If these Republicans aren&rsquo;t stopped, pretty soon it&rsquo;ll be illegal to be an illegal alien.  No telling what other criminal acts they&rsquo;ll make illegal after they get done with that.</p>
<p>All sarcasm aside, I think her &#8220;Democrat-stupid&#8221; statement is more political strategy for 2012 than anything.  Obama needs Florida, and she&rsquo;s from Florida, so I think she&rsquo;s trying to gin up Hispanic voters to keep too many from drifting way from the Democrat-stupid column.  But like I&rsquo;ve been saying, the major swing constituency that put Obama over the top in 2008 were working class middle aged whites in rust belt states, and Obama might have lost those forever.</p>

<p>Granted the Giuliani video above doesn&rsquo;t specifically address illegally penetrating US borders the way the Napolitano video does. However, it does show that confusion over the legal status of illegal aliens is a bipartisan affair. Please keep this in mind when the GOP primaries begin early next year!</p>

		<p>It is a crime (albeit a minor one compared to what it should be) and yet the opposition will not play the stupid card.  Gee, do you think politics just might be rigged?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 12 million but closer to 20-25 and the last big jump (7 million) in the Census should be another &#8220;What, are ya really that ignorant?&#8221; easy gainer for whoever will confront these dead eyed dreamers.  No go.  Do you STILL believe that political debate is not theatrical drama with a purely IITSian (It&rsquo;s In The Script) outcome?</p>
<p>The &#8216;contribution&rsquo; of Mexicans, according to VDare&rsquo;s own Steve Sailer, is something like 10 billion dollars after you consider all the remittances, the transfer payments and the crime.  A drop in the bucket of our GDP but a huge bonus for the corporations that don&rsquo;t pay for the welfare.  Is there any reason -at all- to think that political discourse is, IN ANY WAY, forthright and adversarial in it&rsquo;s attempts to winnow the chaff from the wheat?</p>
<p>The big question then becomes: Who is dumber?  Them for thinking that they will have a role to play in a followon global state whose average IQ is about 83 and ALL of whoe &#8216;developing world&rsquo; subnations are entirely protectionist?  Us for not getting on with the process of creating a replacement nation.  While we still nominally have one of our own to break away from?  </p>
<p>The right hand shakes the left, behind our backs.</p>
<p>And the only way to break their fingers as they dip for our wallets is to make it _explcitly_ clear What Whites Can Do.  When we are not whipped by a hostile elite and burdened by a permanent underclass.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t believe I should be housing illegal immigrants in prison when they shouldn&rsquo;t be here in the first place. Just deport them when sighted; period.</p>

<p>    AMNESTY or as the Pro-illegal immigration groups prefer to label it, Immigration Reform. The truth is not ever going to happen? The 1986 IRCA was a utter calamity and costly for taxpayers.The 1986 (IRCA) Immigration Control and Reform Act that was a mass amnesty, which became the prime deception, played on the American taxpayer of all time. Because of despicably fraud and supreme neglect, the 2 million farmer&rsquo;s laborers and other illegal workers who were provided a legal course to citizenship, that ultimately turned into 6 million. Even inexplicable those people, who received this pardon, vanished from their usual places of employment and turned up in the job force around the country that Americans citizens had to compete with.  Future wise, Congress proposed the I-9 Form (Employment Eligibility Verification Form.) to ensure that all employees presented documentary proof of their legal eligibility, to accept employment in the United States. If the employee has a hiring issue, and chooses to contest an irregularity notice, the employer prints out the &ldquo;Referral Letter&rdquo; from the E-Verify program.</p>
<p>    The letter contains information about resolving the problem, as well as the contact information for the (SSA) Social security Administration) or (USCIS) US Citizenship and Immigration Service, depending on which bureau was the source of the non-authorization to resolve the problem? As constantly the open border zealots, US Chamber of Commerce, ACLU and a radical mix of anti American organizations, have used the Liberal Press as a fulcrum to regrettably try to suppress the implementation of E-Verify. Are we not in the poorhouse with China, as it is? But this is no firm binder, because millions more people will strive to reach here, before that ominoUsing the media these groups have also brought pressure on the administration not to espouse the Secure Communities law, which identifies criminal aliens through fingerprints by informing ICE. Then Subsequently E-Verify that is increasingly more popular each day by business owners. They are now cautiously aware that an I-9 audit puts their business license in jeopardy, as upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>    As with the 1986 (IRCA) bill those who advocate against the laws are profiteers for more wealth, or to accumulate more votes or just to prepare America (according to the WikiLeaks group founder Julian Assange in secret documents) for merging with some kind of traitorous program, with Canada and Mexico with one currency. This stealth agenda was collusion between the Canadian and American Ambassadors.</p>
<p>    Whether we are coming out this miserable recession or not, we cannot afford any immigration amnesty. The first Amnesty in 1986 Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s term of office, cost  &mdash;  $76 BILLION DOLLARS  &mdash;  by the time it was fulfilled. In today money it&rsquo;s expected to cost $2.6 TRILLION DOLLARS as stated the Heritage Foundation. So taxpayers would be expected to cover that bill, lending most of it from China again?</p>

But this is no firm binder, because millions more people will strive to reach here, before that ominous inauguration day of a new Immigration Reform bill.</p>
<p>    If Congress is unable to cut spending in this recent of 14 .5 Trillion dollars US Treasury deficit, can anybody in the right frame of mind, tell us where we intend to get another $2.5 trillion dollars, to subsidize those illegal immigrants already living here? These dollars are inconceivable and even if there was another.  It&rsquo;s outrageous that Washington politicians would expect to bled even more money from  numb Taxpayers, when we are confronted by rejuvenating two nations abroad, in millions of dollars a day.</p>
<p>    Amnesty, it will only further multitudes of people to come here?  Washington legislators come and go, author bills, but are never held accountable for the financial wrecks they leave behind? Only Secure Communities, E-Verify can mitigate some of the pressure that will make foreign nationals think twice before crossing the border, or entering America by other means. This isn&rsquo;t about any particular race, a person&rsquo;s politics, religion as we are all suffering. It&rsquo;s not even about the legal Hispanic population, as they are under the same pain of finding a job, stagnant wages and some type of exploitation. We are all the same boat and without stringent restrictions on immigration and its costs, that boat is heading towards rough waters and could easily sink. The TEA PARTY will slow down this process by confronting Washington aggressively on birthright citizenship to rescind it, which will sever the bond of 300.000 babies from foreign nation getting instant citizenship; cutting down on the annual monolithic cost to subsidize these offspring and families.</p>
<p>    It will also bring to a halt, which it attributed to this wrongly conferred law, saving taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year? The TEA PARTY will examine these unfair taxes placed on Americans, by Liberal oriented courts, to appoint obligations to educate, provide health care that comes with the never ending tide of illegal aliens skirting our laws. The TEA PARTY will created bills to up the penalty, for entering America as a felony. This should have been the law of the land, decades ago? Personally, it has always translated to prove there was no serious intention to enforce these laws.  It&rsquo;s in the vein of a conspirator&rsquo;s reason, why the Southern border fences completion remains a fiasco. The Tea Party will enforce the 1986 (IRCA) law as was planned, with no complicity of government agencies to stifle those laws, such as the business influence.</p>
<p>    The TEA PARTY in 2012 will remove the Liberal influence and even have the empowerment to construct the real border fence, and mandating with no exemptions E-Verify and Secure Communities and indefinately remove Sanctuary Cities nationwide. As the Tea Party grows against the powerful influences in Washington, these Representatives like TEA PARTY Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota will retire those pro-illegal immigrant politicians, Governors, mayors and all those who have adversely affected strong laws that have been introduced. The American People should not be forced by law, to pay for the impoverished people that trespass into America from other countries. The time is ripe to contact their federal and State Representatives to insist they enact mandatory E-Verify, Secure Communities for every State, at the Senate &mdash; 202-224–3121/ House &mdash; 202-225–3121.</p>
<p>    Attn: Be observant on probably the most important election to come,  that illegal aliens don&rsquo;t vote as they have previously and most incidents concealed in different States.</p>
