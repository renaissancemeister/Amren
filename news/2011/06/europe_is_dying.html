<h1><a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/europe-is-dying-us-population-expert-tells-senate-hearing">&#8216;Europe Is Dying&rsquo; U.S. Population Expert Tells Senate Hearing</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thaddeus Baklinski, LifeSiteNews, June 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Given the precipitous decline in the birthrates of European countries, all anti-natal programs funded by the United States should immediately be replaced by pro-natal programs, one top population expert recently told the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we call them reproductive health programs, family planning programs, or population control programs,&#8221; said Stephen Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute (PRI). &#8220;They all have the same effect: they force down the birth rate in countries that are already dying. Such programs are only making a bad problem worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commission Chairman, Rep. Chris Smith noted that the member states  &mdash;  every country of Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as the U.S. and Canada  &mdash;  are already seeing dramatic demographic changes that are &#8220;sure to have dramatic consequences for the security, economic, and human dimensions of the OSCE.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mosher agreed. &#8220;Five centuries after the Black Plague devastated Europe, a White Pestilence is now decimating that same continent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many nations, especially in Europe, are already in a death spiral, losing a significant number of people each year. Listen closely, and you will hear the muffled sound of populations crashing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission heard that the pattern of demographic decline will likely have significant social, economic and security consequences for countries throughout the region. States will become increasingly dependent upon foreign workers in the coming decades, while there will be a dramatic decrease in the pool of potential recruits for military service, resulting in mounting social tensions &#8220;as demonstrated by clashes in some participating States in recent years,&#8221; according to Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is alarming and sad to see xenophobic and ultranationalist violence fueled by one nation&rsquo;s perceptions of long-term decline vis-a-vis another group,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Steven Mosher, whose presentation to the Commission concluded that the downward spiral of fertility decline and resulting demographic collapse is almost beyond reversal, began his address with a quote from ancient Greece:</p>
<blockquote>One remarks nowadays all over Greece such a diminution in natality and in general manner such depopulation that the towns are deserted and the fields lie fallow. Although this country has not been ravaged by wars or epidemics, the cause of the harm is evident: by avarice or cowardice the people, if they marry, will not bring up the children they ought to have. At most they bring up one or two. It is in this way that the scourge before it is noticed is rapidly developed. The remedy is in ourselves; we have but to change our morals. (Polybius, 204-122 B.C.)</blockquote>

		<p>You want women working, doubling the work-force &amp; cutting incomes by 50% while doubling the cost of a post-secondary education? OK. But then you get tired women too stressed from work to be mothers &amp; wives. OK split the chores. And take it out on each other when one spouse had another stress-athon and cant be bothered and neither can the other for the same reason. Russia has programs we can emulate that raised ethnic Russian birthrate but they only mask a problem fecund Muslims lack: Feminism</p>

		<p>&lsquo;Europe Is Dying&rsquo; U.S. Population Expert Tells Senate Hearing</p>
<p>Europe is dying all right, but it isn&rsquo;t due to low population rates.  It&rsquo;s a direct result of trying to maintain their socialist utopia as their revenue shortfalls continue to rise.</p>
<p>The under population problem will soon be an over population problem in the near future when the EU is about one year into the depression.  Food/water shortages will make the elites wish they had fewer people when riots take over their streets and they are no longer safe and secure in their gated communities.</p>
<p>Then there will be the tribal clashes, demanding that the third world elements go back home and bleed the treasury of their home countries dry.</p>

		<p>More crying from the rich, in fear for their asset values.</p>
<p>In the year 1900, the world population was just over one and a half billion. As evidenced by the World&rsquo;s Fair in Paris that year, the First World economies were vibrant and bursting with potential with a much smaller population than today (the world population is now a whopping seven billion).</p>
<p>The contemporary alarm over depopulation is only being sounded by the wealthy, who stand to see their fortunes collapse without constant population growth.</p>
<p>This is why the wealthiest have always supported open borders and increased immigration.</p>

		<p>Ah, Rep. Chris Smith and Steven Mosher, two of the loudest voices of the ongoing &#8220;demographic winter&#8221; scare campaign of the radical pro-natalists.  I&rsquo;m surprised Ben Wattenberg, Nicholas Eberstadt and Philip Longman weren&rsquo;t on hand to testify as well. </p>
<p>Hopefully, the bleating of these people will remain unheeded.  The real problem in Europe, for the hundredth time, is not a shortage of whites, but a &#8220;longage,&#8221; as it were, of nonwhites.  It is an Enoch Powell-style immigration policy that is Europe&rsquo;s first line of defense against a nonwhite majority and the resultant political disaster. </p>

		<p> A sadly accurate assessment of how Caucasians are committing racial suicide in today&rsquo;s world. And the multi-culti liberals couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased; we&rsquo;re starting to fade out of existence right on (their) schedule.</p>
<p> And as the quote from the Greek Polybius so aptly states it, it&rsquo;s avarice or cowardice, or, more properly in modern terms, selfishness, which is doing this to us. It&rsquo;s not that we couldn&rsquo;t raise larger families successfully; the Mormons do it, and the Amish, and the Orthodox Jews. We&rsquo;d just rather have more toys and comforts and &#8220;fun,&#8221; than we would have enough offspring to at least replace us in the gene pool. Some of the European countries are trying to stimulate (White) fertility with subsidies, etc., but it&rsquo;s doubtful how successful this will be. The U.S. isn&rsquo;t even doing that; of course any such attempt would be hysterically denounced as &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;bigotry.&#8221;</p>
<p> We seem to be in the same frame of mind as King Louis XV of France was when he said of his country, &#8220;Things will last in my time, but after me, the deluge.&#8221; Sorry, future generations; we&rsquo;ve got ours and we&rsquo;re having our fun. To bad we didn&rsquo;t even bring a lot of you into existence.</p>

		<p>Europe isnt dying-it is merely shrinking. It can prevent itself from actually dying by allowing NO immigrants into their lands.Human history is rife with examples of one race being numerically and genetically annihlated by races of others who simply invaded and outbred them.</p>

		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t falling birth rates. The problem is population replacement!  Europe&rsquo;s population could recover and grow again, as it did after the black death, and many other historical tragedies (although a little more elbow room in a small crowded continent isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing). All that matters is that an alien population is not allowed in to occupy the vacuum. Take Japan as an example. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if Japan&rsquo;s population is 127 million or 75 million. What matters is if that population is wholly Japanese or not.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that they have gated communities in Europe. I&rsquo;ve never seen any; Europeans don&rsquo;t live that way.  Nor do they have that many of the topmost controlling elites living there.  It must be realized that much of Europe (and western world) has become a cultural/economic extension of the USA, a virtual colony so to speak,  and is controlled from here.   Riots in the streets of Manchester or Antwerp will be of little concern to people living in Beverly Hills or New York. Tut, tut will be their response. </p>
<p>Additionally, I suspect that thoroughly  indoctrinated Europeans (such as the Bitisn and Germans) have been so intimidated and cowed and brainwashed by half a century of self-hate propaganda and love for the dusky races that many of them would rather see their own children (if they have any!) starve than be thought racists   &mdash;   the most horrible thing anyone could be!  Well, we shall see. </p>

		<p>Speaking at an American citizen who has lived in Europe for 16 years, I would say that the 10 most urgent problem facing Europe are Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, Islamization, and Islamization.</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s new minorities are a tremendous financial, social, political, and psychic burden on the indigenous population.  </p>
<p>Europe would be better off without the vast majority of these Muslim &amp; Third World immigrants, who contribute nothing, and live off of taxpayer dollars. </p>
<p>Absent the invading hordes currently destroying Europe, the continent could manage population attrition very well, and prosper in the process, especially if it emphasized eugenic trends (i.e., don&rsquo;t subsidize high birth rates among the mentally challenged at the bottom of society). </p>
<p>Eventually, of course, we need European and white birth rates closer to replacement level.</p>
<p>But the real task at hand is keeping the invaders out, and reducing birth rates worldwide (with the exception of whites, obviously, who have had negative population growth for more than a half-century).</p>

<p>I have noticed that our economies health are based on &#8220;growth&#8221;<br>
so I can&rsquo;t totally disagree.  After all, how can the economy grow with a shrinking population?</p>
<p>Some/many rich folks are just out of touch with reality and believe what they see in the media about diversity being a wonderful thing. </p>
<p>WAY too many people.  Way too many dumb people and not enough smart ones. </p>
<p>The next 100 years will be extremely interesting. </p>

		<p>I recently went to a 30 year high school class reunion.  One of my best friends was there.  He is a German/Canadia mixture.  There were five blonde haired blue-eyed kids in his family.  NONE of them had kids.  In other words, his mother has zero grand children.  I was astonished by that.   </p>

 <br>
More people mean more customers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. <br>
 <br>
One can explain the relationship between population and standard of living with the following equation:<br>
 <br>
(natural resources x level of technology) / population = standard of living.<br>
 <br>
After the Bubonic Plague reduced the population of Europe by at least one third the standard of living for most of the survivors was higher than ever before in history: prices were lower; wages were higher. Fewer people mean more of everything good to go around.<br>
 <br>
Technical advances have usually meant a higher standard of living. Nevertheless, computer technology reduces the economic value of jobs most people can learn, and makes it easier to employers to move professional jobs overseas. Computer technology and population growth are the two main reasons for the growing income gap. </p>

<p>I lived in Europe for some time.  What I noticed is that many women want to socialize and party, have a working woman&rsquo;s life without the problems of family and children until they are 30 or beyond.  Then, they will have one, or maybe two kids.  The chances of birth defects, or other problems are higher after 30 and the women themselves are often infertile due to actual abuse of their bodies over time.  American women are beginning to follow this trend as well.  On the flip side more men are unemployed or underemployed so they cannot support families.  They turn to partying and less future planning as a result.</p>
<p>The other item is that Japan has the same sets of problems, but they are handling it differently. They were over-populated and seem willing to take some economic hits in order to reduce their overall population without importing waves of foreigners.  They continue to be politically exempt from criticism as racists.  Europe&rsquo;s argument for ethnic-racial survival could get a good foothold if they used this example as their right to survive as well.</p>
<p>At some point, it becomes a matter of species extinction.  Will the world care more about a lizard or frog than whites? </p>

<p>You are confusing the symptoms with the disease. The disease in Europe is called &#8220;cultural marxism&#8221;. Its a kind of cultural HIV that removes the infected nations natural defense against opportunistic diseases like Islam. Its doctrines have several different real world implementations, such as critical theory, feminism, sexual nihilism and other practices aiming at revolting against nature. </p>
<p>Cultural marxism is produced in and spread from American universities, American think tanks and American media. If you look closely, you will see that the most decadent European nations are those that are most turned towards the USA and the english speaking world. Speaking of the English, they are horribly decadent, so decadent that its painful to watch, and its not surprising, since they recieve their cultural marxism unfiltered straight from the States. Other Euros have it filtered trough their native media. </p>

He was referring to anti-natal programs in Europe of course. But you are right that when it comes to the United States, we are so minority-oriented, after years of constant  brainwashing, that all our policies and concerns will be directed at what is good for our sacred, protected &#8220;minorities&#8221;. Merely to consider what&rsquo;s good for whites would be considered shocking and racist. That would not be allowed. </p>
<p>But in Europe it would work,  because it could be phrased in terms of protecting the native populations  (nothing about race).</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of these subsidies. It only encourages the worst to have the most children while providing no incentive for the best. I mean, who do you think it is that will be having another kid for 5 grand? </p>
<p>The best pro-natal program is a progressive tax <i>reduction</i> for each additional child. For example, the first child reduces the couples taxes by 10%, the second by 20%, the third by 30% and the fourth by the remaining 40%. I can guarantee you that people would start cranking them out left and right. And the wealthier (read &#8220;smarter&#8221;) someone was the more incentive they&rsquo;d have. But they&rsquo;d have to shrink the welfare state.</p>

		<p>I think the situation is worse than we realize. I went to Italy in 2007 (Milan and Rome) and was shocked by how few Italian children there were (especially in Milan). I think the birthrate in Southern Europe is like 1.2 or 1.3 children per woman, shockingly low. It&rsquo;s the same phenomenon we see here in blue-state America. Women are either too hung up on the careers or think having children is &#8216;selfish&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Was stationed in England in the late 70&rsquo;s. The base was majority black. The English women there would not even dance with a white man. If you walked into the base club on a friday night you would see 400 English women dancing with black men. They would laugh at any white man that ask for a dance. They hate their own race. I hope they are enjoying the muticultural society they have now. They are proud to have killed the white German, but hand their young girls over to Central Asians and blacks to be breed raped and killed. Or turned into a snack on a stick in one case, to be feed back to them. A sorry race of weak minded people. They deserve everything that is coming to them.Won&rsquo;t even protect their children. </p>

<p>Certainly, brains help. I will agree that there is likely to be some correlation, to a degree,  but there are also many other factors involved. </p>
<p>Otherwise, everyone with an IQ over 150 would be a millionaire. That just isn&rsquo;t so!    I really think that too much emphasis is placed on iQ here.  Real life is far more complicated than an IQ chart. </p>
<p>And there are many other factors to be considered as well  (health, longevity, character, etc.) Just because they&rsquo;re rich doesn&rsquo;t make them admirable.  Do you want a conscienceless  robber baron billionaire with a family history of severe health and mental problems to be breeding like a rabbit?  Would you pay Bernie Madoff to have a hundred children just like himself? </p>

		<p>Folks look around.  White women are not the friend of white nationalism&hellip;.in fact they are seeing to the destruction of the white race.  I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t have this note posted, on the grounds of it being irrational and alarmist, but I have seen enough and my eyes do not deceive.</p>

I&rsquo;m not a fan of these subsidies. It only encourages the worst to have the most children while providing no incentive for the best. I mean, who do you think it is that will be having another kid for 5 grand? </p>
<p>The best pro-natal program is a progressive tax reduction for each additional child. For example, the first child reduces the couples taxes by 10%, the second by 20%, the third by 30% and the fourth by the remaining 40%. I can guarantee you that people would start cranking them out left and right. And the wealthier (read &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;) someone was the more incentive they&rsquo;d have. But they&rsquo;d have to shrink the welfare state.&#8221;</p>
<p>GREAT idea.  And when a welfare mother has another fatherless kid, her welfare check goes down by 20%.  Give the poor and low IQ population an incentive to get sterliized.   </p>

One can explain the relationship between population and standard of living with the following equation:</p>
<p>(natural resources x level of technology) / population = standard of living.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Only in simple economic models that fail to take into account absolute resource limites and ecological consequences.  Resources are always a depletion vector (X-yy) and so the Malthusian effects become multiplied by the rate of depletion times the MAGNITUDE of population increase as a function of when the two reach equilibrium of absolute supply rate gain and decrease.  Which is -exactly- why consumerism is bad for everyone.  It encourages matching rates as though population was an infinite gain and society a stable mean.  It doesn&rsquo;t work that way established levels are -lost- when society folds back from finite gains.  And system recovery is never made to the same levels again.</p>
<p>No where is this more clearcut than in oil, the &#8216;P3&rsquo; (Power, Propulsion, Plastic) dominant resource whose consumption, across the board, means terrible consequences to a society faced with England&rsquo;s choices:  Cut down the last of the old growth forests for ships and trade.  Or burn them in the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Oil will be this, X100.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Technical advances have usually meant a higher standard of living. Nevertheless, computer technology reduces the economic value of jobs most people can learn, and makes it easier to employers to move professional jobs overseas. Computer technology and population growth are the two main reasons for the growing income gap. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Computers are nothing but a stepping stone.  The one thing that stops uncontrolled growth is the advent of &#8216;free&rsquo;.  Free labor in particular.  Free works for nothing and so cannot be paid-in to the system by which the rich get filthier, owning 1/1000th of the process profits by which cows become Burger King hamburgers or whatever.  One penny from every toiling back.</p>
<p>Free labor attributes wealth to those who don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t work by -assigning- automated labor product to their support (and by this, I mean empowering women to become mothers because their children are supported, medically, scholastically and in general personal development).</p>
<p>This is why the Japanese are so heavily invested in robotics.  It is why China is unbeatable, short of massive debilitation if not outright disestablishment of the American Work Ethic (pursuit of happiness).</p>
<p>It is why movies like &#8216;Terminator&rsquo; and &#8216;I, Robot&rsquo;, continually portray robotics in a negative light.  It&rsquo;s the faulty belief that economics is the dominant model for human _development_ that is at fault here.  If that were not present, the wealthy would likely be the first to disenable the murderously foolish import of ethnic wage slaves.</p>
<p>Man grows, man falls back when the size of workforce needed to grow is no longr necessary.  This is as natural as the seasons.  It is when you try and -sustain- the inflated population state that things get ugly.</p>

		<p>Feminism has a lot to answer for, but then it&rsquo;s only one branch of the nation-wrecking policies that have been in place for over half a century.  Women(I am one)have a God given duty and moreover are blessed with the most important role in society, that is to reproduce, but this crucial role has been derided and diminished by the Marxist elites. Instead they have convinced women that<br>
 (a) the world is over populated,<br>
 (b) they are just as capable of doing the jobs men can do (do you guys want a 5&rsquo; 5&#8221; woman carrying you down a 40&rsquo; ladder from a burning building?), and<br>
 (c) they can and should have it all, encouraging greed and materialism in place of the family. </p>
<p> Moslems don&rsquo;t follow this line of thinking and never will, in the UK many have a minimum of 6 children, their women do not work outside the home and you won&rsquo;t ever see a burka clad woman atop a fire-ladder. <br>
 For those few women who historically have chosen not to marry but to follow a career, good luck to them, they have never upset the demographic balance, but what is happening now is a deliberate attempt at nation wrecking.</p>

I recently went to a 30 year high school class reunion. One of my best friends was there. He is a German/Canadia mixture. There were five blonde haired blue-eyed kids in his family. NONE of them had kids. In other words, his mother has zero grand children. I was astonished by that. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 42 years old now; hardly any of my peers or even vague acquaintances that I&rsquo;ve known over the last 25 years have children. They think children are a &#8216;hassle&rsquo;, a drain on their fun-time and money. I have one child; it just wasn&rsquo;t going to happen in my younger life due to the contrary nature of the young women I was involved with then. Myself too. We often realise what we should have been doing when we were younger when we get older, or too old!</p>

		<p>White women, in particular, are the targets of the Liberals and Communists, which is what gave rise to Feminism. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that non-White countries are not saddled with Feminism in their cultures? The women that tried that would be severely beaten. They really do know their place. </p>
<p>No, this kind of mind-numbing crap was reserved for the considerate, and fair-minded Whites, who believed in &#8220;Equal Treatment&#8221; even at the expense of their own lives. Such stupidity. </p>
<p>I believe that our upcoming generations can be sparred and saved from the Bantu worhsip culture, if only people taught their children well from a very early age, as we have. </p>
<p>We read great stories about George Washington, and Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Douglas MacArthur, and George Patton, Jr. They have also viewed related movies about such men. </p>
<p>Our children know all about Communism and its lies, and how to spot it when they read, or hear them. </p>
<p>The problem is that most parents do not educate their children as we, our relatives, and friends do. They let the Schools do it, which is the worst thing that they can do. </p>
<p>Their children&rsquo;s educations, and futures, are far too important to be given over to the soft headed Leftist in a tenured School Teacher position. You must lead your children to the absolute truth, no matter what anyone thinks about it. </p>
<p>I suggest that you purchase the DVD from World Net Daily.com called, &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221;. It is imperative that your children watch this video several times to fully comprehend its message. </p>
<p>Do this, along with an assortment of books to read such as, &#8220;You Can Still Trust the Communists&#8221;, and &#8220;The Marketing of Evil&#8221; and your children and relatives kids will be given the tools to openly fight the Red scurge. </p>

		<p>I read an article from &#8220;Off The Grid News&#8221; by Solutions from Science that Genetically Modified vegetables and fruits, especially corn, was being used, as its DNA is being modified, to cause sterility in men and women. </p>
<p>This was documented as a form of global population control. </p>
<p>I have found other reports from other web sites regarding this, that were emailed to me, such as Natural News.com. </p>
