<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hotels, motels and restaurants in the Myrtle Beach area have discriminated against African-Americans for years by refusing to open during Black Bike Week, the NAACP charges in a pair of federal lawsuits.</p>
<p>The civil rights group contrasts the behavior of defendants Molly Darcy&rsquo;s on the Beach, a restaurant and bar, and the American Pancake and Omelet House, with their business practices during the annual Harley Davidson Spring Bike Rally, which is attended almost exclusively by white bikers.</p>
<p>Black Bike Week is the only time of year when most of the tourists visiting the popular beachfront destination are nonwhite, according to the NAACP.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the past few years, Molly Darcy&rsquo;s on the Beach has refused to serve visitors of Black Bike Week by closing during its otherwise customary business hours,&#8221; the complaint states. The same is allegedly true of the American Pancake and Omelet House.</p>
<p>Had the establishments been open, class members would have eaten at both establishments, the NAACP said.</p>
<p>Compounding the organization&rsquo;s anger is that fights and skirmishes  &mdash;  including an armed confrontation between Myrtle Beach police and white biker gangs  &mdash;  have occurred during the Harley Week event, but not during Black Bike Week, yet businesses continue to cater to white bikers and refuse to serve black ones.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From its inception, Black Biker Week has been a more modest  &mdash;  and notably tamer  &mdash;  affair, the NAACP said, with no major skirmishes between police and bikers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the event expanded from tourist sites in nearby Atlantic Beach, S.C., &#8220;the leaders of the Myrtle Beach government and hospitality industry  &mdash;  most of whom are white  &mdash;  exhibited overt hostility to the Black Bike Week Festival because it attracted a large number of African Americans to the area during Memorial Day weekend,&#8221; the complaint states.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s a candidate for mayor, Mark McBride, campaigned on eliminating the event, and after he was elected, lobbied unsuccessfully to have the National Guard deployed during the event.</p>
<p>The city has adopted a &#8220;traffic management plan&#8221; to limit traffic on Ocean Boulevard where bikers during Black Bike Week gather to view each other&rsquo;s rides.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The traffic &#8216;plan&rsquo; was not originally imposed during Harley Week,&#8221; the NAACP says. When it was, &#8220;the owners and operators of local businesses complained vociferously about the change, and Myrtle Beach lifted the restrictions after only three days,&#8221; the complaint states. &#8220;By contrast, the traffic &#8216;plan&rsquo; was retained unchanged for Black Bike Week.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Myrtle Beach Police Inundated With Crime During 8-Hour Window</h2>
						<p><small><i>Tonya Root, Sun News (Myrtle Beach), May 31, 2011</i></small></p>
<p>Myrtle Beach police received reports of five armed robberies, a stabbing, a shooting and an incident involving a shotgun being pointed at a security guard during a nearly eight-hour period in the city early Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Because so many people were in the area for Memorial Day celebrations and the Atlantic Beach Bikefest, officers responded to numerous criminal complaints and traffic violations, said Myrtle Beach police Capt. David Knipes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The incidents and their details:</p>
<p>At 8:50 p.m. Sunday, a 39-year-old man suffered a gunshot wound. A woman told police he tripped and fell, which caused the gun to go off in her Myrtle Beach home at 716 62nd Ave. N., according to a police report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 9:30 p.m. Sunday, a police officer saw an 18-year-old man running, yelling that he had been robbed.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old, a 28-year-old man and another man whose age was not listed on the report told police they left their room at the Bar Harbor and were going downstairs when they were confronted by three men with guns.</p>
<p>One man ran away from the robbers, but the other two told police they were robbed of their belongings. The men told police the suspects went into a nearby room and police found two men matching their description inside.</p>
<p>Officers found marijuana and a stolen gun inside the room and arrested the two men, Knipes said. Charges are pending.</p>
<p>At 11:30 p.m. Sunday, police were called to Fourth Avenue South and Ocean Boulevard when someone pointed a gun at another person, Knipes said. {snip}</p>
<p>Officers were told by Family Kingdom security that a woman reported being raped by several men, Knipes said. The guard told the woman they had to call police, but she left and a short time later he saw her with a man in a sport utility vehicle.</p>
<p>The guard said the woman got out of the SUV and yelled at him about her property being stolen and the man got out and pointed a shotgun at the guard, who ran.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 1 a.m. Monday, a 41-year-old man reported being stabbed in the abdomen. He told police he wasn&rsquo;t sure where the attack occurred. {snip}</p>
<p>The man told police he and his wife were each on their motorcycles stopped at a traffic signal when a large group of people surrounded them and tried to grab the necklaces from his neck. The man said he felt a pinch to his side and the couple rode back to their hotel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police noticed broken glass on the hotel room floor and the woman said she broke a liquor bottle when she cleared the coffee table. The woman said she cleaned up the mess before police arrived.</p>
<p>The woman also had a cut to her foot and she said that occurred when she cleared the coffee table and the bottle was broken. Police also noted a broken shampoo bottle in the bathroom and shampoo on the mirror and ceiling.</p>
<p>At 2:45 a.m. Monday a 24-year-old man told police he was robbed in the area of 12th Avenue South and Yaupon Drive. The man told officers he was walking with a friend when two men, armed with a handgun, took the man&rsquo;s necklace, ring and cash.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 3 a.m. Monday, a couple told Myrtle Beach police they were robbed at gunpoint by two men while on the beach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When police ran the man&rsquo;s name through their computer system they learned he was the victim of a similar style robbery early March 13 in the 100 block of North Ocean Boulevard, according to the report. The man reported the same items reported stolen early Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 4:30 Monday, police were called to the parking lot of the Greyhound Bus Station at Seventh Avenue North, where a driver for Beachside Cab told police he was hit in the head and robbed while sleeping in the driver&rsquo;s seat of his van, Knipes said. The driver told police the robber demanded money and hit him several times in the head before he threatened him with a gun.</p>
<p>The driver gave the man $320 and another man with the robber demanded the driver&rsquo;s cell phone before he hit the man. Both men ran from the area.<br/>

<p>Yeah, all those reports of assaults, robberies and rapes were just made up.  What liars.  Most whites aren&rsquo;t too fond of biker gangs but it seems at least that they don&rsquo;t indiscriminately attack white families that happen by them unlike their black counterparts.  Apparently they also pay their bills when the go for dinner unlike the blacks.  <br/>

<i>Black Bike Week is the only time of year when most of the tourists visiting the popular beachfront destination are nonwhite, according to the NAACP.</i></p>
<p>It must be a statical anomaly that black violence during Black Bike Week is significantly higher than white violence is during Harley Week.</p>

		<p> The news item about the NAACP&rsquo;s typical &#8220;we been discriminated against&#8221; lawsuit offers no rebuttals, of course. But I find the lawsuit&rsquo;s claims that while there has been violence during Harley Week (White), there has not been during Black Bike Week, very highly suspect. When was the last time you heard of a gathering of a lot of blacks where there was NOT violence? Can&rsquo;t remember   &mdash;   right?</p>
<p> Also, while I&rsquo;m no lawyer, I think I&rsquo;m right in saying that a privately-owned business can close for a one-week vacation whenever the owner wants it to. I doubt that any court is going to make itself a laughing-stock by ordering a business to remain open during a particular time period.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t the business owners who closed down due to black mayhem and crime SUE the NAACP? Whites had better start counter-suing if they ever hope to remain in business because to allow an anti-White NAACP to get away with this rip off will only encourage them more. Look at Je$$e and his threats and rip offs raking in millions and for what? The weakness and pandering to these cretins is disgusting. FIGHT BACK! </p>

		<p>If the restaurant owners want to shut down for a week, it&rsquo;s their right.  The law says they can&rsquo;t let in white customers and keep out black; it doesn&rsquo;t say they have to be open 52 weeks a year.</p>

		<p>Interesting how fast the NAACP acted. Like they were waiting to pounce, once they had reports of business closings during Black Biker week. If Myrtle Beach didn&rsquo;t close the same streets and modify traffic flows for the white Harley riders, and the white riders got into large scale fights among themselves and confrontations with the police as the NAACP claims, the NAACP might have a case against the city gov&rsquo;t. But I fail to see any case against the private businesses which elected to close and lose possible revenue rather than take the financial and physical risks of remaining open. I wonder how far they will push this, given the considerable evidence the businesses can surely produce to show they had just cause in closing.</p>

		<p>What makes this especially absurd is that you have an organization suing private enterprises because they don&rsquo;t like the policies of the establishments.   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like me suing a mall because it isn&rsquo;t open at 1AM when I like to shop. They be discriminatin&rsquo; against us insomniacs.</p>
<p>Last I checked the AmRen Pancake House is free to determine its own hours of operation. Blacks think everything is run by some government organization that can change the policies of private shops to their liking. They have no clue as to private enterprise.</p>
<p>In part it&rsquo;s another shakedown for money, of course, but things are so out of hand that I can almost see the Feds ordering the AmRen Pancake House to stay open so blacks can eat (and not pay anyway).</p>
<p>In this case, by not being open, does the NAACP not realize that whites do not get the opportunity to patronize the business as well? I guess they missed that part.</p>
<p>Besides, the NAACP must be run by complete idiots. Businesses need to stay open to make money. And nearly all businesses in America do not care who their patrons are as long as they pay and behave.</p>
<p>The moron mentality of blacks is that the shops close specifically to torment African-Americans. Well, that would be stupid - then the shops cannot make ANY money. Perhaps there is another reason. I wonder what that could be.</p>
<p>Lastly, did it ever occur to blacks that, well, certain shops are closed so there is probably money to be made by opening their own shops for a weekend. Why not contact the city and see if a license is available for a temporary omelet or pancake house since so many hungry patrons are attending the festival. No, it&rsquo;s much easier to sue whitey. </p>
<p>Keep the shops closed - the heck with them.</p>

		<p> I agree wholeheartedly with Poster No. 5. Anti-White hate groups like the NAACP and the Southern Poverty Leadership Conference have gotten away with filing unanswered lawsuits for far too long.</p>
<p> As I&rsquo;ve said on this site before, the best defense for White people who are under attack in this way, is a good offense. Sock it to groups like that in the courts; give them a good, stiff dose of their own medicine, and after a few tastes of it, they won&rsquo;t be so ready to initiate legal action at the drop of a hat.</p>

		<p>Restaurants used to closed during the horrid &#8220;freaknic&#8221; festivals in Atlanta too. The restaurants lost all of their normal clientele (that would avoid the hoards of blacks filling the streets).</p>
<p>The few black clientele are rude and do not tip. Much nicer for them to close and give their staff the weekend off rather than force them to work in unpleasant circumstances with throngs of rude blacks that won&rsquo;t tip them no matter how good the service was!</p>

		<p>While I find it humorous the way the MSM plays semantics games with &#8216;Atlantic Beach Bike Fest&rsquo; and &#8216;Black Bike Week&rsquo; and &#8216;Memorial Day &#8216;Crowds&rsquo; Trash Myrtle Beach&rsquo; etc. the reality remains that this is just a case of freedom of association.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like being in the company of a given individual because of his race or criminal tendencies of his racial group, you should be allowed to avoid that person.  You can no longer choose not differentially refuse to serve him as a business owner while maintaining service to rowdy whites (I remember a few years back the last NAACP lawsuit mentioned the Pagans and the Angels went toe to toe for a couple hours during Biker Week).</p>
<p>But you should still have the right to close shop, accept your losses and go be with your family.</p>
<p>I guess until we hear from an MBPD officer which group is worse, there will be nothing but he said/she said out of this.</p>

		<p>The more I read about these stories, the more I see our country is headed on a downward spiral. It is very difficult not to feel as a white person, that our rights are being stripped before our very eyes. We tried to get along with black people and bring them up, only to see their hatred of us grow and begin to bring us down, with their hand out always wanting more. It&rsquo;s amazing to me to see how fast our country destroys itself while the liberal media shoves lies down our throat daring us to speak out against them. I am not sure where rock bottom will be but I have no doubt it is coming unless radical changes occur. </p>

		<p>My uncle rides a Harley and is a member of the Detroit Renegades Motorcycle Club.  I&rsquo;d feel a LOT more comfortable at the Renegades&rsquo; clubhouse than Black Bike Week.  The Renegades are actually pretty decent guys, as far as I know.</p>
<p>And since when is &#8220;discrimination&#8221; a dirty word?  To me it means &#8220;discerning,&#8221; to use good judgment.  Seems that&rsquo;s what a lot of business owners did in Myrtle Beach  &mdash;  used their heads and decided to stay closed!</p>

Funny about that. I used to work till late at night back when cable TV first came out. I got on my white horse and told the cable company I was either gonna sue or quit paying because when I got home it was nothing but INFOMERCIALS!! I demanded that they distribute them evenly thoughout the programing day, not just between 2am and 7am and start playing some late night movies. After failing that, I got a new job and started sleeping at 10pm. It still annoys me though.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Uh like it or not this is in fact the law. The civil rights act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination in hotels and restaurants. Keep in mind to bring a lawsuit, all you have to do is alledge, not prove discrimination.</p>
<p>Whats more in civil rights cases, there are attorney&rsquo;s fees provisions, so if you chose to fight and lose because of some white hating judge you have to pay the Plaintiff&rsquo;s legal fees which in a class action lawsuit are going to be in the millions of dollars.</p>

		<p>Private business owners have the right to close their businesses when whenever they want. They were not serving other races and dening black customers. They denied everyone. Do we really want the government with the powers to tell business owners what day they must be open to serve their customers? </p>

		<p>The NAACP is an obsolete organization still trying to get  donations from deluded white liberals.  So they have to do something to look viable.<br/>
Businesses simply have to refuse to settle such lawsuits in order to save legal fees and avoid publicity engendered by blacks.  #6 Elli puts it succinctly:  businesses break the law if they serve whites and refuse to serve blacks  &mdash;  and let me add WHILE THEY ARE OPEN.  Any business in the U.S. has the right to close!  Any court in the land should agree, and if one dumb or white-hating judge disagrees, a higher court, at some point, will agree.  Some businesses pay off race hustlers to save money.  Do we ever hear about businesses that stand their ground?</p>

		<p>Why would black bikers want to hold an even at Myrtle Beach in the first place? Blacks are not that fond of the beach or getting a sun tan. Why not have &#8220;Black&#8221; bike week in Detroit or some other major black area that could use their business. </p>
<p>Why not just put the even out there and see if any city really wants to host the event? </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how this can be called discrimination?<br/>
They don&rsquo;t put up signs No black Welcome, they close the door to everyone.<br/>
To a black discrimination and racism are whenever a white does that does not cater to their every need, whim and desire.<br/>
I worked in a Restaurant and I can tell you when (groups) of blacks came in the problems started.<br/>
When will these blacks come to understand You Reap What You Sow.</p>

		<p>So, now the NAACP is calling for forced labor, otherwise known as indentured servitude? Private business no longer have the freedom to decide when they are open and when they are closed if it is up to them. This attitude is fed by the continued overreach of the unconstitutional Civil Rights Act of 1964. </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m not a lawyer. If the businesses are forced to stay open as a result of a lawsuit; doesn&rsquo;t it stand to reason that they they should stand responsible for the damages that occur as a result of the ruling??<br/>
 I&rsquo;m just asking.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe there is any civil rights group that can claim discrimination if a business closes its doors to all patrons.  Further, if it does so in the face of high crime periods.  Alternatively, have a cover charge and/or raise prices during these times.  Just doing what the economists say, charging what the market will bear.  And compensating for expected damages.</p>

		<p>As usual blacks can&rsquo;t face reality and take responsibility for their own actions, especially the NAACP.  Reminds me of the time I was walking the dog I had at the time,a big rottweiler-German shepherd mix in Birmingham, AL.  An obnoxious black woman who I found out later  was a local &#8220;community spokesperson&#8221; tried to get in my face and say that dogs like mine should be prohibited.  In turn, I told her; &#8220;If you f  &mdash;    &mdash;   people did&rsquo;nt commit so much crime, we wouldn&rsquo;t NEED to have dogs like mine!&#8221;  That shut her up real fast.  I think the stupid NAACP will just keep trying to push whites around until more of us tell THEM to shut up.<br/>

		<p>Gee, I can&rsquo;t figure out why most whites don&rsquo;t like blacks either.  Couldn&rsquo;t have anything at all to do with the large amount of illegimate children in the black population, their inability to delay self-gratification, their inability to blame their own failures on themselves, their inability to evolve as whites/Asians do, their inability to not keep blaming the past for their problems, their inability to work hard instead of screaming &#8216;racism!&rsquo; to get what they want, their inability to stay in school, speak properly, work hard, work legally, work ethically, save their money, stay out of trouble, etc.  Yep, just can&rsquo;t understand why most whites and other nonblacks have disdain for blacks. That&rsquo;s a real headscratcher there&hellip;</p>

		<p>For those who say that Whites should fight back against these extortion lawsuits, I ask, where is the money to fight these lawsuits coming from.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the NAACP and SPLC are funded by some of the wealthiest people in the world, such as Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance, Teresa Heinz Kerry of the Tides Foundation, the Ford Foundation, George Soros, the billionaire entertainment industry etc etc etc.</p>
<p>Most plaintiff lawsuits are filed with the intention of getting a settlement rather than fighting it out for years.  Most plaintiff lawsuits are not extortion.  The defendant really has done something that is either a civil or sometimes even a criminal wrong and should pay expenses for the damage the defendant did.</p>
<p>Generally the defendant and their attorneys know the defendant is at fault and settle.</p>
<p>Face it people, we Whites are facing more money and expertise that both the Russians and Chinese at the height of the cold war had to spend to destroy us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If those bars were forced to stay open because of threats from the NAACP, they should have made it a point to play alot of country western music and have only male waiters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Way back in the 1970s, I ran a Radio Shack on Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles.  Every store was required to have some sort of music playing on a stereo during store hours. To keep the trash out, I played classical, Broadway, the Great American songbook (&#8220;the standards&#8221;),  My store employees were almost all white. The exception was a part-timer from Ceylon who was an engineering student out at UCLA. Great crew, and they liked the music.</p>
<p>I got trash in the store of course; you always will in a downtown location. But I hardly ever saw the same trash twice.</p>
