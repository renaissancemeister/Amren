			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toraine Norris, The Birmingham News, June 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bessemer and Hueytown police, Jefferson County sheriff&rsquo;s deputies and ambulances descended on the Alabama Adventure theme park in Bessemer this afternoon, with witnesses reporting numerous fights inside the park.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Felix Torres, who was visiting the park today with his son, described it as a &#8220;borderline riot.&#8221; He witnessed at least eight different fights, including chair throwing in the water park, and at least three people taken out of the park on gurneys, he said. &#8220;Every time we turned around, there was a fight,&#8221; Torres said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the race riots of the 1960&rsquo;s.  Waht happened, our federal government and judiciary gave the blacks everything they wanted and more.</p>
<p>The way the blacks rioted and Johnson/Nixon caved in would lead an objective observer to believe that the riots were coordinated with federal government objectives arrived at long before the riots.</p>
<p>I predict that absolutely nothing will be done at either federal or local level to punish these thugs.  The police will be ordered to stand down.  The amusement and vacation venue operators will be ordered to remain open or face crushing fines.</p>
<p>Public beaches, parks etc will turn into killing zones for Whites.</p>
<p>I honestly think that all this was pre arranged by the Obama administration and the black community.  I worked for the Nixon Ford Carter administrations and saw how those 3 presidents worked hand in glove with black radicals.<br>

		<p>When the media reports &#8220;fights&#8221; involving blacks, assume a White person is being attacked.</p>
<p>This is why we had Jim Crow laws.</p>
<p>Jim Crow laws did not discriminate against people simply because their skin tone was dark. Rather, Jim Crow laws protected White people (and blacks who behaved themselves) against violence and crime. </p>

		<p>Another example of why blacks are classic criminal narcissists; every small gesture, however unintended, is something &#8220;done&#8221; to them.  A benign comment directed at one of them ebcomes an act of war.  That&rsquo;s why &#8220;fights&#8221; seem to break out so often in large groups.  </p>
<p>Any honest psychiatrist can tell you that most black teens and adults have the emotions of small children.  </p>

		<p>Sounds like Obama&rsquo;s getting ready to unleash the thugs. In the past week we&rsquo;ve seen about 20 urban riots. Just a word from the Democrats and the violence will go nationwide. The message: re-elect Obama or we&rsquo;ll burn down the country. Right out of the communist playbook.</p>

		<p>To all you White folks in the South. I personally want to apologize for all the pompous White liberals who for years branded you as &#8220;good old boys&#8221;, &#8221; racist bigots&#8221; and &#8220;rednecks&#8221;.<br>
They had no clue about what it&rsquo;s like to live among the Mau Mau. The only consolation is that they are now learning the hard way thanks to the Internet, You Tube and other sites who can do the end run around the MSM and show you exactly what we&rsquo;ve reaped after years of social programs and hand outs to these primitives; most of whom will never even approach civilized. </p>

		<p>Amazing, they act like this is a new problem but I do believe I saw a single white in the entire crowd.</p>
<p>The white owner/manager has the typical attitude: &#8220;All is well, we&rsquo;re in normal operations!&#8221; (please, come spend some more!).</p>
<p>And the black reporter wants to know who sprayed the mace, probably looking for a lawsuit for the SPLC/NAACP.</p>
<p>But nobody notices the problem is that every person in the video is black and the one that kept getting in the (black) staff guys face was wearing a red doo rag.</p>
<p>I would be interested to see attendance ratings for this bunch and plot that graph against yearly profits.</p>

		<p>Black teens were doing this in San Francisco 50 years ago.  At one point some of the private girl&rsquo;s schools switched from uniforms to regular clothes because the big brave black boys saw the girls in their uniforms and attacked.</p>
<p>When the street cars had to line up at the castro street entrance to the tunnel, black kids would swarm aboard beating passengers and grabbing purses.</p>
<p>Some were caught, but as no one could identify them they were never charged.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a better city.  Poetic justice Obama, Ayers and Rahm this is the result.  The gays and rich elites will still vote for Obama in November 2012.</p>
<p>Mobs Attack on City Buses: </p>
<p>Gang of teens storm bus, attack victims and run off with their belongings, police say<br>
Tuesday, Jun 7, 2011  </p>
<p>In two separate incidents, as many as 15 teens have stormed Chicago Transit Authority buses, attacked their victims and darted off with cell phones and other electronic devices, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Both incidents were near the University of Illinois at Chicago campus, prompting city and campus authorities to issue community alerts.</p>
<p>In the first attack, near West Roosevelt Road and South Loomis Street at about 11:40 p.m. Saturday, a victim was struck multiple times before the thieves ran off with his cell phone.</p>
<p>About 25 minutes later, near South Racine Avenue and West 13th Street, a student said he was sitting on a No. 12 bus when as many as 15 black boys and young men boarded the bus without paying.  The student was hit in the back of his head with a glass bottle and was robbed of his iPod, said UIC police.</p>
<p>An ambulance took the student to University of Illinois Medical Center for treatment, the alert said.  Surveillance video from the bus may be available for review, it said.</p>
<p>The young thieves were described as being between 14 and 20 years old, standing between 5 feet, 5 inches and 6 feet, 1 inches tall, and weighing between 140 and 180 pounds.  They were last seen wearing baseball caps, shorts and T-shirts.  Some of them had braided hair and others had short hair, the alert said.</p>
<p>The community alerts come as other mob attacks in Streeterville and along the lakefront are making headlines. Five teens have been arrested in connection with the Streeterville attack, but police Supt. Garry McCarthy vowed to find more of them.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the bus attacks should call Area 4 detectives at 312-746-8253.</p>

		<p>Whenever you have a fair proportion of these people, these precise things happen. It is a mathematical certainty. Sadly we must pretend it is not. </p>
<p>I quit attending amusement parks years ago because of this type of behavior. I am beginning to wonder if the joys of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; are destined to destroy any forms of public recreation. </p>
<p>At least I still have country music concerts and ice fishing derbies, for now!</p>

		<p>Is there any venue where or situation in which the Bantu behave like mature civilized human beings? Perhaps the problem lies in describing these places as &#8220;family&#8221; parks. They just don&rsquo;t seem to understand that concept&hellip;or they simply act the way they do in their own government sponsored habitats, with no regard for children, people who work for a living or the elderly.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new, really.  Back in the 70s, our small town had two swimming pools, one downtown and the other in the black section of town.  After the blacks destroyed their pool, they began using the other pool.  It, too, was destroyed within a few short years.  Our town no longer has a municipal pool.</p>
<p>Whenever you have blacks in large numbers, in anything, problems will result.</p>

		<p>This is just another example of the anti- White campaign pot being diligently stirred by the Progressives ( Progressing toward Armegeddon).<br>
Read the article from the link below. Notice the use of the words &#8220;Rich&#8221; and &#8220;White&#8221; almost as though they were obscenities.<br>
Rich is only bad when it describes Whites. <br>
Rich Black drug gangsters could also qualify for mortgages but no mention is made of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d personally love to see a total tax boycott of by every hard working White person in this country. They can&rsquo;t arrest the entire White population!<br>
A vain dream of course because too many Whites don&rsquo;t even have the courage to defend themselves or other Whites being attacked by Mau Mau. They&rsquo;re contented to be the numerous Wildebeest grazing on Football, Bathketbau, Extra, Access Hollywood, American Idol, Dancing with the Stars and Reality shows and hoping that the predators won&rsquo;t select them.</p>

<p>Wherever blacks congregate, the potential for violence rises. &#8216;Good natured&rsquo; hoopla and jostling can quickly turn into outright violent confrontations. In Buffalo, they have police at the bus stations after school to protect blacks from blacks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if blacks are deliberately trying to disprove the liberal Big Lie that they commit mayhem due to &#8220;social injustice!&#8221; Even the Chicago media is starting to take notice (while covering up the race of the perpetrators as best they can, of course). </p>
<p>Americans have made the supreme effort of trying to be &#8220;inclusive&#8221; towards blacks by electing a black POTUS, and this is what happens. Will this wake anyone up?</p>

		<p>Back in the &rsquo;40s, my mom used to take my older sister to a park called &#8220;Riverview&#8221; in Chicago.  One day my mom and sister were waiting in line, minding their own business, and a black woman took out a knife and told my mother she was going to kill her when she got off the ride.  That put an end to Riverview.  Eventually the whole park closed down.  So this has been going on for a long time.  Even at places like Disneyland, people report that gangs of blacks will push, shove, cut in line, etc.  Several posters here have said things like, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t go to amusement parks or fairs anymore.&#8221;  Fine.  So once again, blacks win.  Once again, blacks take over and destroy, whites run away in fear, whites are robbed of activities that used to be a lot of safe fun for them, businesses suffer, etc.  How much more of this are we going to take?!  When will we stand up and demand that blacks stop acting like this?  Will we roll over and hand them EVERYTHING they demand?</p>

		<p>This event is a perfect example in microcosm of what is otherwise known as &#8220;white flight&#8221;.  A rowdy crowd moves in, personal security and peaceful enjoyment are replaced with crime, violence, noise and an overall sense of discomfort and oft fear.  The former peaceful residents move out.  This is the fate of all communities, and it is the fate of the amusement park.  No surprise it becomes self-segregating.  Those that build, respect a social contract, and have insight into their actions and the related long term effects naturally have more resources.  And they move away from those that don&rsquo;t.  This is natural selection.</p>

		<p>As the popular euphemism of the mainstream media says, &#8220;Oh look&hellip;  It&rsquo;s another &#8216;flash mob&rsquo;.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Google &#8220;flash mob&#8221;   It&rsquo;s a term used to describe either 1) a group of idiots spontaneously breaking out into a dance routine based on some pre-arrange meeting via social networks&hellip;  or 2) a group of black thugs beating down randomly on non-blacks.</p>
<p>If a group of white kids attacked non-whites randomly in cowardly many-on-one assaults, I guarantee you that it would not be called a &#8220;flash mob.&#8221;   The media and the democrat party are complicit in consciously borrowing a term to hide the nature of these epidemic of brutal assaults being committed by black mobs on non-blacks all across the country. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s got NOTHING to do with the &#8220;color of their skin&#8221;- and everything to do with behavior. We Indians, even the ones who are darkest than the darkest Blacks, never go to any public event that&rsquo;s more than 10 percent Black because we value our safety. Disney World and Disneyland are both nice, safe, clean amusement parks that we can enjoy because it stays less than 10 percent Black. I&rsquo;m taking the kids to Disneyland next week and I&rsquo;m going to make a point to take a &#8220;racial survey&#8221;. Disneyland is definetely not &#8220;all white&#8221; as many AR readers would like it to be but the Asians far outnumber the Blacks there.</p>

		<p>For some reason I hear &#8220;Gangtsa&rsquo;s Paradise&#8221; playing in the background. Obviously the management has lost control of the park- in just about every amusement park I have attended had a dress code- basically &#8220;no shoes, no shirt, no service&#8221;. Most of the people in the video were either shirtless or wearing some sort of revealing tank or tube top. If parks like this would institute a dress and conduct code this kind of ridiculousness would be minimized. If I saw that my family would be the only white faces in the park I would run- not walk- to the nearest exit! </p>

		<p>Anywhere you have and amusement park where blacks go you have the AIDS virus. Most of that water is warm and even though it&rsquo;s laced with bleach it could still carry a virulent strain that could get inside a cut.</p>
<p>I stay away from blacks every chance I get they just don&rsquo;t do anything for me. I hate shopping at the grocery store because I see the mixed couples or the two toned kids. This makes me sick, sick, sick I so far have had no problems but the time is coming. Maybe a flash riot or something else. </p>

Sounds like Obama&rsquo;s getting ready to unleash the thugs. In the past week we&rsquo;ve seen about 20 urban riots. Just a word from the Democrats and the violence will go nationwide. The message: re-elect Obama or we&rsquo;ll burn down the country. Right out of the communist playbook.<br>

The black ghetto riots that happened from 1964 to 1968 turned the white working class into a Republican constituency, and the United States into a Republican country. Leaders of the Democrat Party are thoroughly aware of that. <br>

Thomas Edsall explained the process in his book &#8220;Chain Reaction: The Impact of Race, Rights, and Taxes on American Politics&#8221;<br>

		<p>At first I thought the sound quality was bad or my connection was so bad that I could not understand what was being said in the video.  Then I read the comments and youtube and learned nobody  &mdash;  or those that are not black  &mdash;  can understand the commentary in the video.  It is as though it is in another language.</p>

		<p>Take a close look at the beginning of the fight.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure the booth operator is trying to protect a white child huddled on the right side of the booth.  One section seems to show the child being kicked before the thug is chased away.</p>

		<p>Name one city or town in the USA that has improved with the infusion of Blacks. You can&rsquo;t.<br>
Name one country in Europe that has been enriched by the immigration of large numbers of Blacks. You can&rsquo;t.<br>
Name one country in Africa that has been able to prosper following the end of colonialism.  You can&rsquo;t. Even the former British colonies to whom the British left infrastructure and practice in government are either failed or verging on failure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the race riots of the 1960&rsquo;s. Waht happened, our federal government and judiciary gave the blacks everything they wanted and more.</p>
<p>The way the blacks rioted and Johnson/Nixon caved in would lead an objective observer to believe that the riots were coordinated with federal government objectives arrived at long before the riots.</p>
<p>I predict that absolutely nothing will be done at either federal or local level to punish these thugs. The police will be ordered to stand down. The amusement and vacation venue operators will be ordered to remain open or face crushing fines.</p>
<p>Public beaches, parks etc will turn into killing zones for Whites.</p>
<p>I honestly think that all this was pre arranged by the Obama administration and the black community. I worked for the Nixon Ford Carter administrations and saw how those 3 presidents worked hand in glove with black radicals.<br>

<p>The LAWS in this country instituted by the race traitors and the enemy within (don&rsquo;t forget the UN) have handcuffed ALL White people. We have been forced at the point of a gun to get on our knees and beg forgiveness from these cretins who want us all dead.</p>
<p> Until we get off our knees and throw off the blinders we will soon become extinct as a race. We talk until we are blue in the face and things only get worse. Talk is cheap as they say, and it sure hasn&rsquo;t gotten us anywhere, just the opposite. Time to change our strategy.</p>
<p>BTW, how many years have these &#8220;neocon&#8221; talk show hosts been on the air and we are ten times worse off than before? Makes me wonder what their game really is? They are NOT on our side, as time and their words has proven.</p>

		<p>As someone who lived in that black-created hellhole, Birmingham, Alabama, blacks acting lawlessly and with no respect for anyone else is no surprise.  The only thanks I have for the whole experience of living there is that place taught me racial consciouness and ultimately killed any last vestige of liberalism I might have harboured; especially the garbage that blacks are &#8220;just like us.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How do some amusement parks avoid this completely while others are swamped with diversity? I went to Six Flags in St. Louis recently and I expected the worst, but I could count on one hand the number of thugs I saw. It was almost all suburban whites, surprisingly. And St. Louis has just about the highest crime rate in the nation. How do they pull this off? It wasn&rsquo;t much different from when I used to go there in the eighties.</p>
<p>And the last time I was at Disney World in Anaheim it was also a safe atmosphere, nothing like I keep seeing in these news reports. Even though it is located in a grimly diverse area, somehow most of the patrons were white, with a number of well dressed Asians and Hispanics. Thugs were almost non-existent.</p>
<p>I want to know these places&rsquo; secrets to maintaining islands of civilization among the diversity. </p>

		<p>I really like the idea of having a restaurant or movie theater by invitation only. We used to call them clubs. My parents belonged to one associated with a very well-known university on the east coast. Qualifications: had to be teaching there.  Now, fifty years later, you know what kind of people can get into faculty clubs, and the qualifications haven&rsquo;t changed.  Sigh. </p>

<p>When did you go to Six Flags?  What day of the week?  What was the weather like?  I can assure you that any Saturday with weather that at least approaches decent, Six Flags is going to have plenty of enriching diversity.  Except, now that you mention it, getting me to think out loud, I have noticed that there don&rsquo;t seem to be as many special programs on the part of Six Flags to get reduced admissions, as there were in the past.  I&rsquo;d also be willing to bet that programs to reward the diverse public school student body in St. Louis who did well (i.e. showed up more often than not), have been cut back drastically.  It&rsquo;s entirely possible that the upper management quietly want to cut back programs that allowed St. Louis&rsquo;s diversity to get in free or at reduced costs, because Six Flags Inc was under Chapter 11 in the 2009-10 time frame.  Maybe in that case they needed more and more people to pay &#8220;full freight&#8221; in order to rosy up revenue projections in order to impress the bankruptcy judge.</p>

		<p>With the &#8220;headquarters&#8221; of the black brawlers seeming to be in Chicago (at least that&rsquo;s where more attacks have taken place than anywhere else), it makes you wonder if rahm and barry cooked up a few plans while R.E. was still in the White House. I also wonder if it&rsquo;s tied into a world-wide plan for the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; to show Whitey who&rsquo;s in charge now. The &#8220;community leaders&#8221; in all these majority black cities are close to Farrakhan who is close to Gaddafi who is close to&hellip;. <br>

<p>All well and good. But if that club serves liquor, they need a license to do so. That means they magically become a &#8220;public accommodation&#8221;.  See: 1964-1965 civil rights acts.</p>

All they need is to be &#8220;free.&#8221;  And that they have been in Chicago for almost a century.  I do find the timing relative to Rahm formally becoming Mayor to be curious.</p>
