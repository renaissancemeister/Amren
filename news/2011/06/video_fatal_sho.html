			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>HyperVocal, June 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This past weekend, Washington, D.C. held its annual DC Caribbean Festival, which bills itself as &#8220;one city, one parade, one love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Except the 2011 variety was anything but.</p>
<p>Two separate incidents marred the weekend festival. One man was shot and three others were injured after gunfire broke out between rival gangs near the festival&rsquo;s parade route. Then, in an unconnected event, a brawl broke out at Howard University during the parade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police insist that the shooting was a neighborhood matter and that unfortunately, three bystanders got caught in between. &#8220;We believe three of the four are innocent bystanders,&#8221; Assistant Police Chief Diane Groomes said, reports Fox News. Two males and one female were amongst the injured. One of them is believed to be in critical condition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Incredibly, police are also saying there was an unrelated stabbing incident that occurred just a few blocks away. An arrest has been made in the stabbing.</p>
<p>Further, at Howard University there aren&rsquo;t too many details on the brawl that broke out, except there is excellent video footage, courtesy of World Star Hip Hop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll definitely want to stick this video out, which does get boring in some places, but right around the 3:25 mark turns into a full scale WWE-style wrestling bout, complete with steel chairs getting lowered onto people&rsquo;s heads.</p>

		<p>The Caribbean Festival seems to have been marred by Afro-Americans.  The dress, body weight and behavior suggests the latter.  I am sure the few Caribbeans that attend were appalled. Then again those Caribbeans were not likely surprised, as Caribbeans here in the US tend to live away from Afro-American communities.  </p>

		<p>Is that a white kid in the white Tee-shirt?  That shirt is known as a &#8220;wife beater&#8221; in my neck of the woods. </p>
<p>If you stop the vid at 1:02 it appears to be a white kid. </p>
<p>I wonder what he was thinking of diversity at that moment?</p>
<p>What a shame that kids can&rsquo;t just have a good time.  </p>
<p>I am beginning to think that whites created YouTube just to make blacks look bad. lol </p>

		<p>These &#8220;people&#8221; are animals! I have seen too many of these incidents that I can say with all certainty that we have uncivilized animals walking upright in our midst. And, of course, there are the predictable responses, &#8220;white people act like this too!&#8221; My response is RARELY have I ever seen white people act like this. Actually I have NEVER seen it in person. Time to separate!!!!!</p>

		<p>These Howard University students are supposed to be some of the best and the brightest that we have. We see that they act like some of the most primitive animals, showing no self control whatsoever, but simply beating the tar out of each other for the shear joy of inflicting pain. What animals! Disgusting!!</p>
<p>Their vote counts as much as yours our mine, quite possibly more because they are likely to vote multiple times. Makes you feel real good doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Watching one non white&rsquo;s hit another over the head with a chair and hearing a loud pop, yet seeing no apparent injury, reminded me of what a friend, who worked as an X-Ray technologist once told me. She stated that whenever doing X-ray head scans on patients of African decent, based on necessity, it was her usual practice to increase rad levels a few notches, due to their thicker skulls requiring a more powerful(X-ray)dose to penetrate.</p>
<p>Now in light of all the many injuries to white&rsquo;s by similar mobs<br>
of non whites, find it possible non whites are unaware, that their skulls are, on average, thicker than that of most whites and likely better at sustaining chair over the head attacks.<br>

<p>College. It ain&rsquo;t what it used to be. </p>
<p>Bottom line is, if you&rsquo;re not studying engineering, math, or some hard science, you are most likely not university quality and would not have been at university by the standards of just a few decades ago. </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m convinced that most Asians and Europeans have little idea of what&rsquo;s going on here in America regarding our racial problems. Scenes like those represented by the video of the DC Caribbean Festival are unusual but not particularly rare in black urban areas. In my opinion these types of mass altercations seem to be on the rise in our minority communities. Unless a real effort is made by our government and black community leaders to address these problems, the situation will only deteriorate further to the point of widespread periodic anarchy. I&rsquo;m afraid we seem to be at that point now.  </p>

		<p>Why not just let them have their &#8220;festivals&#8221; and beat and kill each other to their hearts content. If it spills over out of the designated area, steam in hard with gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and batons. Mop up any stragglers and beat them senseless.   Any White folks who attend one of these events deserve anything that happens to them.  They know its going to end in tears, they&rsquo;ve been told often enough, they see it happen time after time.  I&rsquo;m waiting to see what happens at this years mugging and beating festival in London, the Notting Hill &#8220;Carnival&#8221;.  On top of an already well proven recipe for disaster (a large gathering of mainly black &#8220;yoots&#8221;), there is rumbling discontent in the UK as a whole, and it will only take a bobby to look at a &#8220;yoot&#8221; in the wrong way, to spark off a week of violence and looting. </p>

		<p>With the coming of summer, this year things seem to be getting worse. Worse than normal. And that&rsquo;s pretty bad. I don&rsquo;t know if it is the economy, the use of phones to create a lot of the mass, spontaneous violence or what.  But things most definitely are getting worse.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re asking about the one in the tank top, no.  He&rsquo;s a very light skinned black.  I downloaded the high definition versions of these videos, and it&rsquo;s much more obvious in 1080p than it is in this version.</p>

<p>That is certainly not the case in New York.  Are you living in another world? </p>
<p>The West Indian Day parade that winds up summer in Brooklyn, is notorious for its violence and mayhem. The police consider that if they can get through that one without a riot, they have made it through the summer. </p>

		<p>Welcome to the jungle, it get&rsquo;s worse here every day.</p>
<p>Note that everyone is a &#8216;male and female&rsquo;.  Which equals black crime and white victims.  And is it fair to assume that &#8216;one man shot&rsquo; means one man -killed- since they only list three victims at the hospital??</p>
<p>Oh well, critical condition doesn&rsquo;t count for -attempted- first degree homocide (crime commited in the act of another, planned, crime) I guess&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shaping up to be one heckuva Fourth.  If you live in one of &#8216;those&rsquo; cities, please take a word to the wise: Pack up your family and starting on Friday night get out of town.  Go visit relatives, go camping, whatever.  But do not be in BRA Central from Friday until at least Tuesday.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it&rsquo;s gonna get brutal.</p>
