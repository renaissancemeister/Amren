<h1>Unfortunately for Mothers, Suspects in Flash Mob Case Will Be Made Example</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Mitchell, Chicago Sun-Times, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I was struck by what Tonia Rush said after her son, Dvonte Sykes, was arrested and charged with robbing a Thai man in a violent &#8220;flash mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rush said she believed her son&rsquo;s $250,000 bail would have been lower if the crimes were on the South or West sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s black-on-black crime, nobody cares,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Obviously, somebody cares.</p>
<p>But Rush makes an unpleasant point. If this kind of violent behavior had occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood, it wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the nightly news.</p>
<p>But everybody&rsquo;s talking about the &#8220;flash mobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thus far, five men  &mdash;  none of them black  &mdash;  have been beaten and robbed of their iPhones, iPods, cell phones and wallets in flash-mob attacks.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, all of the participants in the attacks were black. Unfortunately, the black community has long had to deal with roving mobs of black youth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Had these mob attacks taken place on the South Side, I not only believe that the bails would have been lower, but also that the crimes would not have been taken seriously enough.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the mothers, their sons will likely be made examples.</p>
<p>This level of violence will never be tolerated in the Loop, or on Rush Street or Division Street or the Magnificent Mile or the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>That is not solely because a lot of wealthy white folks live downtown. It&rsquo;s because any place tourists spend money is sacred ground.</p>
<p>This is the kind of negative publicity that creates a political environment resulting in decent teenagers paying a heavy price for being foolish.</p>

		<p><i>Had these mob attacks taken place on the South Side, I not only believe that the bails would have been lower, but also that the crimes would not have been taken seriously enough.</i></p>
<p>A)  You couldn&rsquo;t find enough willing witnesses on the South Side in order to generate enough probable cause evidence to convince a judge to set a high bail.  &#8220;Nobody saw nuttin,&#8221; or &#8220;stop snitching.&#8221;</p>
<p>B)  If we actually did what Miss Mitchell wants, she&rsquo;d be banging the computer keys at the Sun-Times whining about &#8220;white racism&#8221; in the justice system.  I&rsquo;m surprised her complaints about low bond amounts for black on black crime doesn&rsquo;t veer along the lines of &#8220;they&rsquo;re telling us implicitly that black lives are worth less.&#8221;</p>
<p>C)  Because there might well have been evidence of racial hate, that is one extenuating circumstance that would automatically cause bond amounts to be higher.</p>
<p><i>Unfortunately, the black community has long had to deal with roving mobs of black youth.</i></p>
<p>Well then why doesn&rsquo;t the black community do something about it?  Start snitching, start convicting, start exerting pressure within the political process not to coddle criminality.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right - they&rsquo;re being made examples of. </p>
<p>Tough luck!</p>
<p>Perhaps if blacks on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side demanded more from their police and, indeed, from themselves - from their kids and from their neighbors - flash mob incidents on the South Side would get as much attention.</p>
<p>It is hardly unfair for an outrageous, frightening crime spree to get a lot of attention and for the perpetrators to be made into an example.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s anything surprising or unjust it&rsquo;s that Chicago&rsquo;s blacks accept similar sorts of behavior in their own neighborhoods like it&rsquo;s an everyday occurrence. The bottom line is that it&rsquo;s up to a community to clean itself up and to police itself. No one&rsquo;s going to come down from the sky and do it for you.</p>

		<p>Perhaps black communities are more tolerant of gang behavior inclusive of random violence. Apparently the white communities are less accepting of criminal behavior and more apt to call the authorities.  The &#8220;don&rsquo;t snitch&#8221; ethic prominent in the black communities has yet to be adopted by white communities.  Such is the nature of diversity.</p>

		<p>And if roving gangs of white skinheads were terrorizing black neigborhoods would that get balanced media coverage too? Which do you think would be more sensationalized?</p>
<p>And since none of the victims were black, where are the hate crime charges?</p>

		<p>Tonia Rush said after her son, Dvonte Sykes When a mother and son have different last names that immediately makes me think the son has a high potential for thugishness.  The name Dvonte is another risk factor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s black-on-black crime, nobody cares,&rdquo; she said. I don&rsquo;t care, I worry about black on white crime.  The question should be why don&rsquo;t blacks worry about black on black crime, or at the very least place the blame where it belongs..on other blacks.  In addition, black on black crime is not a racially motivated hate crime attack like black on white flash mob attacks are, despite what our AG says.</p>
<p>This level of violence will never be tolerated in the&hellip; Actually this level of violence has been tolerated or underplayed in too many areas of our nation.  That is why things have devolved like they have.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Decent teenagers paying the price for being foolish.&#8221; You gotta be kidding me. NO decent teenager would jump an unarmed person, kick him, stomp him to the ground, and take his valuables. Boy oh boy&hellip; We&rsquo;ve really dropped our standards in this country if this thuggery qualifies as just being &#8221; foolish.&#8221; No. It&rsquo;s criminal behavior, and not simply foolish. That is what the person cloaking as a journalist on this article is. </p>

<p>I think I am going to be physically sick.<br>
Does anybody remember a Superman villain, Bizarro? He came from Bizarro world were everything was twisted and inverted in comparison to our own Orthodox realm. Well each day I realize we live in Bizarro world. </p>
<p>Teenagers committing random felony assaults, hate crimes, and robberies are labelled &#8220;decent&#8221; in our hellish Bizarro world. <br>
And having to answer to their victims and the law for only being &#8216;foolish&rsquo;, like say good &#8216;ole Ronald McDonald or Krusty the Clown, I guess is too harsh a penalty in Bizarro world, e.g. Multicult America and Europe. </p>
<p>When I read statements like the above in the MSM which are circulated to the masses, I comprehend all too well that real tangible evil truly exists. </p>
<p>This is truly sickening!</p>

		<p>Wow, what can anyone say about that article? It&rsquo;s either a front-runner for idiot piece of the year or satire but I suspect the writer is far too stupid for satire.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember reading such an ignorant collection of words and that&rsquo;s saying something.</p>
<p>Maybe Dvonte and his buddies can smash a bottle over Ms. Mitchell&rsquo;s head, steal her wallet and laptop, and kick out a few teeth. Then we&rsquo;ll see if she thinks these are good kids.</p>
<p>She writes: That&rsquo;s because tourists and residents in the city&rsquo;s wealthiest ZIP codes are getting a taste of what residents in poorer areas have lived with for years.&#8221; </p>
<p>What exactly does that mean? That since barbaric behavior afflicts blacks who cannot control themselves that it&rsquo;s okay for such antics to be thrown onto whites? That&rsquo;s third-grade logic for you. Also, how does she know that the tourists are all wealthy whites? </p>
<p>I am (almost) stunned at how moronic the writer is.</p>
<p>She quotes the mother of one thug as saying, &#8220;If it&rsquo;s black-on-black crime, nobody cares.&rdquo; Which is like saying, the mother doesn&rsquo;t even care if blacks brutalize each other. </p>
<p>Or this gem from mom, who believes &#8220;her son&rsquo;s $250,000 bail would have been lower if the crimes were on the South or West sides.&#8221; Translated into dumbspeak, she essentially admits that its okay to attack and pummel her black neighbors because obviously, they are worth less than whites.</p>
<p>This is a real winner: &#8220;But as they say, idle hands are the devil&rsquo;s playthings, and there are too many idle black teenage males. These teens couldn&rsquo;t get a job if they tried given the high unemployment rate. Free organized sports and other recreational activities are also in short supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, if black teenager males are bored you can expect them to act like animals. With all the so-called community activist groups there are unlimited volunteer activities they can do - how about simply cleaning up the neighborhood as a start.  </p>
<p>And of course, in the biting the hand feeds you part, she wants FREE organized sports. Nothing&rsquo;s free. Guess who&rsquo;s going to pay for it? We are. And why can&rsquo;t they organize some athletic activities on their own? Oh, the average IQ of 82 - right.</p>
<p>Mary is partly correct on one point, however. &#8220;This level of violence will never be tolerated in the Loop, or on Rush Street or Division Street or the Magnificent Mile or the Gold Coast,&#8221; she writes. Unfortunately, she can&rsquo;t quite understand why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell her.</p>
<p>White people are civilized. </p>
<p>And, at this point, the message is that whites have long since given up on blacks. If they want to attack each other like dogs there is little we can do to stop it. Just keep it in the &#8216;hood. <br>

		<p>Another problem with this mentality   &mdash;   If we can&rsquo;t ID race because of fears of &#8220;bigotry,&#8221; then we shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to identify anything else.  Remember the &#8220;Missouri Miracle&#8221; of several years ago?  Michael Devlin was eventually apprehended with two of his victims in his apartment because someone saw a white compact Mazda pickup truck speeding away from a rural area, the truck not &#8220;belonging&#8221; in the area, at the same time a young man was reported missing.  Someone saw a white compact Mazda pickup in the parking lot of a suburban St. Louis apartment complex, called the cops, the cops asked questions, got probable cause, got warrant, and got Devlin, and rescued Messrs. Hornbeck and Ownby. </p>
<p>Now, using Miss Mitchell&rsquo;s precepts, we shouldn&rsquo;t be bigoted toward white compact Mazda pickup trucks, or their drivers.  For after all, 99.9999% of those who drive white compact Mazda pickups aren&rsquo;t kidnappers and pedophiles.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Decent teenagers being foolish??&#8221; </p>
<p>The MSM has sunk to a new low in its mendaciousness.</p>
<p>If these crimes were white-on-black there would be no dismissal of it as &#8220;decent teenagers being foolish.&#8221; It would be a &#8220;hate crime,&#8221; pure and simple.</p>
<p>Everything that this writer is complaining about is exactly the way the lefitsts have set it up to be.</p>
<p><i> Had these mob attacks taken place on the South Side, I not only believe that the bails would have been lower, but also that the crimes would not have been taken seriously enough. </i> </p>
<p>If they are taken more seriously, then blacks complain about &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and the high percentage of blacks in prison.</p>
<p><i>This level of violence will never be tolerated in the Loop, or on Rush Street or Division Street or the Magnificent Mile or the Gold Coast.</i> </p>
<p>The leftists insisted that blacks be able to insinuate themselves into all white areas, but when whites have the nerve to ask that they actually behave themselves while there, it&rsquo;s a tragedy!</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the racial makeup of the neighborhoods of this writer and her cohorts&hellip;</p>

<p>Only a bigot of the most obvious sort would portray violent criminals as being &#8216;decent teenagers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There is a world of difference between getting in fist fights at school or at a party, getting caught out after curfew, or other such &#8216;normal&rsquo; offenses that require more measured punishment and the deliberate planning of strong arm robberies and mob assaults.</p>

<p>If the media reports black crime in black neighborhoods, blacks will be up in arms that the press is focusing on black crime. &#8216;Why is the media always reporting black crime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>If the media downplays black on black crime, blacks complain that nobody cares about black on black crime. &#8216;Why doesn&rsquo;t the media care when blacks are victims of crime?&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This Mitchell is just another black columnist who writes about race incessantly, a professional black. A black commits a crime and she looks for some angle in it to critique his being locked up, trying to turn it around to attack the white community in some way. This is an attempt to draw attention away from the real victims.<br>
The article is really just a smokescreen. Cut to the chase, she&rsquo;s black and thinks it&rsquo;s alright for blacks to do whatever they please.   </p>

		<p> Unfortunately for the mothers, their sons (and sometimes daughters) are thugs. No jobs in the &#8220;inner city&#8221;? Cry me a river! Does anyone think they&rsquo;d take them if they were available? And maybe White Chicagoans and officialdom would be a little more strict about policing the South and West sides if they thought the people who live there were trying to teach their youngsters how to behave like civilized people. Obviously, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p> That touching complaint, &#8220;If it&rsquo;s black-on-black crime, nobody cares,&#8221; reminds me of a scene in a &#8220;cops&#8221;-type movie I saw years ago. A black police officer who has just arrested a black thief, tells him, with no apparent irony or trace of a smile, &#8220;You steal from White people, that&rsquo;s your business. You steal from black people, that&rsquo;s MY business.&#8221; In other words, when it&rsquo;s black-on-White crime, blacks don&rsquo;t care. As broad as it is long, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s white-on-white crime, I care. Throw the book at them.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s black-on-white crime, I care. Throw the book at them.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s white-on-black crime, I care. It reflects poorly on whites. Throw the book at them.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s black-on-black crime, you&rsquo;re right. I don&rsquo;t care to be called a racist and smeared for speaking out against black-on-black crime. Blacks should be the one&rsquo;s dealing with it by cooperating with the police and demanding stiffer sentences. But blacks hate the police and courts. And make excuses for black criminality. So tough luck. Blacks have the crime rate they deserve. And I&rsquo;m going to make sure that the crime rate they deserve doesn&rsquo;t become the crime rate I deserve.</p>
<p>I would like readers to note that these women are not complaining about either the black-on-black crime or the black-on-white crime. They&rsquo;re simply demanding that we roll over and allow roving gangs of blacks to attack anyone they choose with impunity.</p>

		<p>This article&rsquo;s viewpoint along with black parents imposing NO disciplinary actions on their offsprings are the reasons for generational black poverty, crime, high school drop outs rates, etc.  Every excuse is made and accepted by some whites for generational black dysfunctional behavior.  Because of all this catering/pandering, blacks have actually regressed since the so called Civil Rights era.  These whites catering/pandering to blacks deluded themselves by playing holier than thou games.</p>

		<p>Yet more breathtaking deceit, hypocrisy, mendacity and bare faced lying from blacks.</p>
<p> I suppose this woman is completely unaware of the Al Sharpton circus and gravy train and the attendant media feeding frenzy whenever a White harms a single hair on a black&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>  Is she unaware of cases such as the Rodney King beating and the James Byrd dragging that are repeated over and over again on the hour every hour by the entire news media until they get the result they want, ie the images are seared indelibly into everyone&rsquo;s minds and the media&rsquo;s narrative burnt in.</p>
<p> How about that case of a black woman burning a White kid to death with a blow torch in Texas, a few months ago?, No you didn&rsquo;t remember it because the media don&rsquo;t want you to remember it.</p>
<p> As for her point that &#8216;black on black&rsquo; crime is down graded, well quite frankly what blacks do to each other is none of whitey&rsquo;s business, and it&rsquo;s up to blacks to sort their own selves out.</p>

		<p>During World War II, there were a lot of &#8220;Good Germans&#8221; and &#8220;Good Japanese.&#8221; Women, children, old people. But they supported the young men fighting at the front. As nice and non-violent as they might have been, they were still the enemy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with the U.S. black community today. Mothers, grandparents, doctors, lawyers, &#8220;activists.&#8221; They may not be hardened criminals out doing murders and robberies &mdash;  &mdash; but they support their young fighting &#8220;men&#8221; by not snitching, throwing bail, giving aid &amp; comfort, providing food and a place to sleep (read: hide), defending them in the press, etc. </p>
<p>Are these two wars any different?</p>

<p>Stop blaming the victim and then pretending that things will get better if everyone is &#8216;outraged&rsquo;.  You were robbed and should not have been.  As long as the opportunity is there (blacks on the bus, not IPhones in public view), the crime will never go away and as our economy tanks they may start to &#8216;assume&rsquo; whitey has the goodies, whether you show it or not.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Stop it.  Being born white and successful is neither stupid nor your fault.  Being pounded by 15+ blacks who come from all sides _in a white = wealthy neighborhood_ WHERE YOUR INTELLIGENCE sends you to be safe is not foolish.  Living in a constant state of  terror that degrades your social intellect destroys what makes you special.  Assuming that the predominantly black and hispanic underclasses won&rsquo;t come to where they find rich Asian and White victims may be foolish but only if you don&rsquo;t start to take steps to ensure that they can&rsquo;t.  Only if you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary to start making those kinds of judgements.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&#8216;Masque Of The Red Death&rsquo;  The nobles keep the plague victims on the outside of their armed compounds but find death follows them anyway.  Living in the outer &#8216;burbs is expensive.  You have to go twice as far.  You have to pay for everything.  And that&rsquo;s what (formerly) kept blacks at bay as a population in cities.  There was only so much room and so many jobs.  Give them a chance to spread and they will.  And then it will follow you back to the city when you flee your beautiful home.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Chicago is becoming much more like Paris - where the Central City is cleaned up, Whites take back the best places and the NW poor, criminals are pushed out to outer ring suburbs or in our case to Indiana.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Blacks will go where it&rsquo;s cheap to live.  If whites make urban living cheap by gentrifying street restaurants and mom and pop groceries and the like, blacks will come back and, absent restrictive zoning laws, you will be right back where you started, in the asylum with the inmates.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Other good news, decent middle class Blacks have turned big time on the Black underclass - it&rsquo;s getting to be like India where the Shudra caste is considered untouchable.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing if you prefer the company of whites because &#8216;middle class&rsquo; blacks need white custom to stay that way, genetics are against their kids having as high an IQ as they do.  And the underclass get creamed so often that there is _no_ saving them.  2.5% of blacks have a 115IQ or better, suitable for college.  16% of whites do.  That&rsquo;s 900,000 vs. almost 24 million.  We can barely sustain ourselves.  Blacks cannot.  And don&rsquo;t want to.  What they fail to realize is that for all their yelling about &#8216;racism&rsquo; and attempts to &#8216;be white&rsquo;, they are _still not wanted_, because it makes a lot of socially uncomfortable to deal with them.</p>
<p>Joining us at the hip based on some preconditional class statement is not going to change that.  It&rsquo;s merely going to make it look like A/A works, &#8216;forever and ever and ever&rsquo;.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d better.  Because black crime is now mobile rather than regional and it will become more so as economic conditions become more difficult.  Dispersing crime from the urban to suburban environment is like tossing diseased corpses over the walls of a city in the bad old days.  The contagion spreads.  Whites flee the suburbs for the exurbs and _the city dies_ because they no longer can nor want to make the trip back in.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Blacks wanted the right to govern their own communities and they now have it. Would a white man or even a black man that promised to get tough on crime ever be elected in a black community? <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want blacks to govern MY community sir.  And that&rsquo;s what this will come down to.  &#8216;Freedom Of Movement&rsquo; is a sure sign of loss of national and racial sovereignty because you can bet your last dollar that they WILL come to you.  And once they are there, they WILL assume that this is &#8216;their turf&rsquo;.  That is how they are function in terms of social psychology.  It had better be something you learn to do in turn or you will be dispossessed, utterly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The plain truth is that blacks are more tolerant of crime than whites.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The plain truth is that black crime finds a suitable victim group, like lions find the zebras.  This is not just a result of a rising black middle class people.  It&rsquo;s not &#8216;just&rsquo; about a temporary aberration known as Obama.  It is a deliberate social engineering strategy designed to so intermix us on the basis of _temporary_ relief from 
<p>Just like Putnam warned-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The notion of social capital has been around for decades (see the article on social capital elsewhere on these pages for a fuller treatment). It is with the work of Jane Jacobs (1961), Pierre Bourdieu (1983), James S. Coleman (1988) and Robert D. Putnam (1993; 2000) that it has come into prominence. This is how Putnam (2000: 19) introduces the idea:</p>
<p>Whereas physical capital refers to physical objects and human capital refers to the properties of individuals, social capital refers to connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. In that sense social capital is closely related to what some have called &ldquo;civic virtue.&rdquo; The difference is that &ldquo;social capital&rdquo; calls attention to the fact that civic virtue is most powerful when embedded in a sense network of reciprocal social relations. A society of many virtuous but isolated individuals is not necessarily rich in social capital.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.infed.org/thinkers/putnam.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.infed.org/thinkers/putnam.htm</a></p>
<p>Social Capital and Class Inheritance are at opposite ends of the same spectrum.  The wealthy know that you are what you were born to be.  They LIVE IT in their moneyed understandings of who they are and what it buys them.  Unfortunately, this means they place no value on the rest of the middle and working class beneath them _regardless of race_.  Which is why they are such devout &#8216;non racists&rsquo;.  They hate us all, equally.</p>
<p>Globalism to them is just a way to cement further their wealth base while destroying the social mobility of those who might have otherwise come up through the system which WE, not they, pioneered.</p>
<p>And that is why you see false reporting of flash mobs _now_, as though &#8216;public attention&rsquo; to the issue will do any good.  When in fact what you are seeing is the opening round in the final dissolution of our nation.  The next step is to forcibly disseminate the vector for crime like a disease, flushing the urban areas outwards like a public toilet into white American middle class communities which are the only remaining seed-culture strength we have.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t realize what (rich) _whites_ are doing to us and begin to set up separation paths as internal borders of like minded communities that refuse to participate in our social denigration on a mass scale of social disobedience to these social engineering constructs.  We will be destroyed, by our own kind.</p></p>

		<p>Daniel #25 hit the nail on the head. The problem is you can never satisfy the blacks, if the police look the other way at crime in the hood they don&rsquo;t care, if they crack down they are racist, so I say as long as all of this nonsense stays in the hood let them have at it. Here in NY a judge just revoked a probation deal for a young sister accused of assaulting another sister with a padlock inside of a sock and ordered her to stand trial. Betcha within a few day&rsquo;s many elite blacks will be decrying the RACIST decision of this White woman judge. You just can&rsquo;t win with them.</p>

		<p>Poster 20 said: &#8220;As for her point that &lsquo;black on black&rsquo; crime is down graded, well quite frankly what blacks do to each other is none of whitey&rsquo;s business, and it&rsquo;s up to blacks to sort their own selves out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And poster 25 also made the point, and I think that people like us don&rsquo;t trumpet this line often enough.  </p>
<p>1) If black people are the overwhelming majority of a city, town or neighborhood, it is up to black people to police their own.  No white town expects black politicians or black cops to come in and save them from themselves.</p>
<p>2) If black people are the majority in a place, do they really want white cops (or even black ones) coming in and busting some heads around?  Cries of &#8220;Powlice brutality&#8221; would well up in the streets.</p>
<p>3) If there&rsquo;s no white people to speak of anywhere around, how can they blame whitey for a lack of order in the &#8216;hood?  Many cities and towns and districts are in the hands of blacks now.  Can&rsquo;t they get it together without us?</p>

<p>The point, dear writer, is that these flash mobs do not take place in black areas like the South Side.  They happen where large numbers of whites congregate.  Since the mobs are all black and not residents of the area, that means mobs of blacks are <i>targeting</i> whites.  And that is the racial significance of flash mobs.</p>

		<p>The bigger picture here is that when blacks are caught doing these crimes excuses are made which equates with more government programs for blacks.  Well if these young people had a gym to play midnight basketball then they wouldn&rsquo;t be bored to have to beat people senseless.  You laugh at this but I will bet you that some politician will respond with more hand-outs of our tax money.  The reason blacks have come to expect these hand-outs is because they know the politicians just want to appease them out of fear.

		<p>What it all boils down to is that the &#8220;evil racists&#8221; like Lester Maddox, George Wallace, Sheriff &#8220;Bull&#8221; Connor and the leaders of the White South African government were right. They knew Blacks much better than the White northern liberals who never had to deal with them in close proximity. </p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t trust any of these charlatans whom we elect to office and that goes from local councilmen all the way up to the White House. The conspiracy theory &#8220;nuts&#8221; who claim that there&rsquo;s a government agenda to eliminate or at the very least to marginalize the White population to the point of complete social and political impotence suddenly don&rsquo;t seem so nutty after all.</p>
<p>I have lost all faith in the Republican party and also the so called Tea Party. We have possibly the most critical election in our history coming up and they haven&rsquo;t produced one candidate who has a chance of beating Obama. They came up with Herman Cain. How pathetic! Hey now WE have our OWN Black guy! Do they have ANY recollection of Clarence Thomas? No disrespect meant to Cain.  HE seems like a nice enough man. Would that every Black man were like him but by the time the MSM and the Black race hucksters get the hooks into him, he&rsquo;ll be reduced to dust.</p>
<p>Whatever happens there will be the results will be the same except for the degree of violence it will produce. If Obama wins Blacks will feel validated and the attacks against Whites will continue perhaps with more frequency. If he loses there will be a total collapse of law and order and the White community will be under siege. I was talking to a financial adviser last week and I asked him what I should invest in should the interest rate fall any lower. His response was &#8220;ammunition&#8221;.</p>

<p>Several years ago, I made the observation that blacks who have political (real or quasi) over other blacks will wind up, one by one, piece by piece, ordinance by ordinance, regulation by regulation, law by law, salami slicing style, and unconsciously, re-enact the Jim Crow and segregationist system, even if said blacks with power made a career in opposing it way back when.  A series of nightclub shootings in East St. Louis(*) and the black Mayor and black Chief&rsquo;s call for a series of ordinance changes that sounded eerily like the Deep South in the 1920s is what got my mind to thinking in that direction.  (*) - Just for edification, I wish I had a dime for every time a non St. Louisan thinks that East St. Louis is merely a neighborhood or section of St. Louis.  Really, East St. Louis, Illinois is its own city in a different state.</p>
<p>Last week, the half white liberal half black (but heavily white liberal in its municipal politics) suburb of St. Louis closely associated with Washington University voted on an ordinance that would have made the teen curfew even stricter and made the local ordinance on obstructing the free flow of sidewalks even tougher.  It was in reaction to the melee of young blacks at the light rail station closest to that suburb&rsquo;s yuppie restaurants, the cash cows for the city.  The ordinances failed, but they remind me of these rumored &#8220;Sundown Towns&#8221; that the civil rights historians like to complain about, where blacks and other minorities supposedly had to vacate by sunset. </p>
<p>So here you go, the white liberals who run University City, Missouri wanted their town in essence to become one of those rumored &#8220;Sundown Towns.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The lesson of all this is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter who has governing responsibility over blacks, be the white racialists, white liberals, other blacks, or what not, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s in the Deep South, or not in the Deep South, or even outside the United States   &mdash;   The natural habit of those that do, if left unfettered, is to enact what we like to deride as Jim Crow and apartheid.</p>

		<p>Thank you for some interesting posts, people. I have said for years (poster 28) that globalism/ globalization is &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; for the rich elites. But those same peiple who claim to be Americans are nothing but traitors. Traitors to the White American working class &amp; traitors to America as a whole. The bailouts that W &amp;  Obama approved was NOTHING BUT SOCIALISM FOR RICH PEOPLE. But the Tea Party bunch wants you to think it was all the peoples&rsquo;s fault who bought these homes. Who spend their time and craft learning the language of home loans? Not the Joneses. It was Madoff &amp; Abramoff on Wall Street. They had all the power. The Republicans wanted to blame the financially challenged class(regardless of race), for the housing market. I don&rsquo;t think so. It was like all levels of banking were making $, except for the middle class. </p>
<p>Buying power is down 35% from the early 1980s. Wage &#8220;growth&#8221; has been stanate since 1981. Carter was obviously clueless as President, but Regan systematically dismantled the working class. Most likely it&rsquo;s irreversible. </p>

They just worry about innocent black teens being lumped in with the thugs. The democratic media need minority votes to elect democrats so they must show blacks that they&rsquo;re on their side. They must kiss up to blacks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This is the kind of negative publicity that creates a political environment resulting in decent teenagers paying a heavy price for being foolish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So let me get this straight here.</p>
<p>Committing felonies makes you a decent teenager?</p>

		<p>I am new to the site, I have long imagined the suppression of news as it relates to racial matters, so I am glad to have found this site.  What is alarming is that THIS is intentionally perpetrated by the liberal establishment.  In Great Britain, the liberals have ADMITTED to importing minorities to De-Anglicize the country, just to show the conservatives that they could! It stems from the mistaken belief that if you bring someone into your society, they replace those that are born into that society, that they will have the same ethos of the natives.  Thus is born the myth of multi-culturism.    I will continue reading your site with enthusiasm to its aims of expanding openness of reporting, and continue to sound the alarm bell of our country being subsumed by its invading hoards of minorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obviously, there is no excuse for beating up people and taking their stuff. But as they say, idle hands are the devil&rsquo;s playthings, and there are too many idle black teenage males. These teens couldn&rsquo;t get a job if they tried given the high unemployment rate. Free organized sports and other recreational activities are also in short supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>This makes me angry.</p>
<p>I think the person who wrote the article should be sued or giving a taste of the victim&rsquo;s medicine.</p>
<p>What a jerk!</p>

		<p>People in Chicago have long been aware of the laughable columnist Ms. Mitchell.</p>
<p>The funny part is in a previous column a day or two day earlier she wrote how she sends her grandson to a white private school to keep him away from blacks. </p>

<p>How did I know it was a black grievance and entitlement-monger who wrote that?</p>
<p>If I get mugged again, I will have to remember that they are &#8216;decent teenagers &hellip;&rsquo; &#8216;&hellip;being foolish&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, the part of that sentence missing in my quote can be left out, because they almost certainly would not be &#8216;paying a heavy price&rsquo; for their chosen actions.</p>
<p><em>Rush said she believed her son&rsquo;s $250,000 bail would have been lower if the crimes were on the South or West sides</em></p>
<p>I suspect that bail would have been set at $0.00 if the thug had not been helping to rob five non-black men of their &#8220;iPhones, iPods, cell phones (btw, an iPhone is a cell phone), and wallets&#8221; </p>
<p><em> Unfortunately, the black community has long had to deal with roving mobs of black youth.</em></p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, so have we. If this is what they are breeding, then maybe they should look to see where they are going wrong.</p>
<p>When I say &#8216;we&rsquo;, I clearly mean ordinary people in relatively low-profile jobs without the cachet and status of syndicated journalism and possibly a privileged background studying English Literature at an up-market University.</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately for the mothers, their sons will likely be made examples</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately for <em>Us</em> these &#8216;mothers&rsquo; are not being held to any measure of responsibility for lacking the capability to raise their (doubtless fatherless) children adequately.</p>
<p>We have to pay the price both ways; subsidising dysgenic fertility, then reaping the harvest for such stupidity.<br>
