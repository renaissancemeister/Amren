<h1>Critics Condemn Boortz Rant on Violent Crime</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Leslie, 11 Alive (Atlanta), June 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Atlanta radio talk show host Neal Boortz is getting negative national attention for his recent comments on violent crime in Atlanta.</p>
<p>In reaction to news of two violent carjackings, he said:</p>
<blockquote>This town is starting to look like a garbage heap. And we got too damn many urban thugs, yo, ruining the quality of life for everybody. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s gonna take. You people, you are  &mdash;  you need to have a gun. You need to have training. You need to know how to use that gun. You need to get a permit to carry that gun. And you do in fact need to carry that gun, and we need to see some dead thugs littering the landscape in Atlanta. We need to see the next guy that tries to carjack you shot dead right where he stands. We need more dead thugs in this city.</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Boortz also complained about graffiti in Atlanta and the message it sends:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;This city harbors an urban culture of violence. And I want you to look around. You drive into the city. The railroad overpass is on the downtown connector covered with graffiti. And that  &mdash;  that is just an advertisement for everybody coming into this town that we really don&rsquo;t give a damn about those who would screw up our quality of life around here. We really just don&rsquo;t care. We don&rsquo;t care enough to paint over graffiti on the overpasses that come into our city, advertising welcome to Atlanta, here&rsquo;s some of our finest graffiti, from some of our finest urban thugs and their little gang signs. And pick up the paper tomorrow morning. Read about all the carjackings. Read about the innocent people shot for the pure de-hell of it.&#8221;

		<p>Gee, and poor Mr. Boortz had tip-toed ever so carefully around the subject of just which dark continent might be the malefactors&rsquo; ancestral homeland&hellip;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten to the point where any adversion at all to any subject whatever that might make somebody somewhere think about black people in a non-deferential way is ipso facto &#8220;racist&#8221; (an ethnic slur applied presumptively to all white people for the crime of living while white).</p>
<p>And maybe someday even white people in the media will get tired of living by lies&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I think the NAACP needs to be charged with racial profiling. Neil Boortz made no reference to race. Unless urban thug is the new N word. I mean as recently as the 1990s Urban thugs as depicted in the movie State of Grace were either Irish or Italian. But had he used the phrase Suburban Thug according to the sellers of Home security systems are white.</p>

		<p>Boortz is a multimillionaire blowhard.  He&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>What is relevant is the amount of &#8220;urban art&#8221; graffiti in Atlanta and Midtown.  It&rsquo;s everywhere, and we should celebrate it.</p>
<p>Graffiti is criminal vandalism, so when you see it, see it as a tag of criminality.  We welcome Atlanta showing us the true markings of its native population.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want graffiti only on the south side and in the ghettos.  We want to see it wherever they roam, because we know that we aren&rsquo;t safe, especially at night, so we take precautions and huddle inside with our guns and religion (the old time religion, folks, nothing like the short-haired, pants wearing type we get in churches now).</p>
<p>Graffiti is honest- take it at face value- what happens when that graffiti &#8220;artist&#8221; sneaks up behind you in parking lot when you are leaving an Atlanta restaurant for your car?   Feel safe?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go out at night in Atlanta bc the graffiti warns you not to.  We want more of it, because more warnings help save lives, White lives, that is.  That&rsquo;s all we care about.</p>
<p>The news from Atlanta is that a black inmate in the most secure part of the Fulton Co. jail got his hands on a gun and shot at another inmate.  Who has time to worry about Boortz when guns are smuggled into jails?   Feel safe?<br>

		<p>Excellent.  He is expressing the feelings of MILLIONS OF WHITE people who are getting fed up with the destruction to the white way of life. </p>
<p>We all know who builds a civilization and who destroys it. We have allowed the &#8220;urban youths&#8221; to destroy what our people have built. Bortz knows what is coming as do the rest of us.</p>
<p>As we sink into a 3rd world nation, and as we go broke, the white people WILL defend what is left of America.  There is no other way out. We didn&rsquo;t support Lincoln&rsquo;s movement to deport the freed slaves so now we will have to deal with the situation ourselves.</p>

		<p> There&rsquo;s an old saying: &#8220;A guilty conscience needs no accuser.&#8221; The NAACP nabob knows that nearly all the violent crime in Atlanta is committed by blacks   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s why he got all hot and bothered about Boortz&rsquo;s statements.</p>
<p> If you&rsquo;ll notice, Boortz made no racial references, whatsoever, in his so-called &#8220;rant.&#8221; He was simply stating the facts, and his opinion about what the public should do to protect itself, since it appears that the police, in Atlanta and elsewhere, are not able to do so. If it has to come to what Boortz suggested, then let the thugs fall where they may.</p>

		<p>This is the same Neal Boortz, who, about ten to a dozen years ago, was so opposed to &#8220;white racism&#8221; that one might have thought he was secretly on the SPLC&rsquo;s staff.  Channeling Jack from Chicago, we&rsquo;ll know if and when the transformation is complete when he gives up libertarian economic rationalism, both in general and as a solution to racial issues.</p>

		<p>Remember when Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder people said that we&rsquo;re a &#8220;nation of cowards&#8221; when it comes to race - well now we see what happens to someone that talks HONESTLY about race. Whose the REAL cowards? Now think about it - who in their right mind would be AGAINST getting rid of the thugs that cause so much pain and misery on countless people of ALL races? Why does the THOUGHT of dead thugs littering the landscape OFFEND them, when the REALITY of innocent dead people littering the landscape doesn&rsquo;t? They may condem him, but they can&rsquo;t disprove him either!</p>
<p> *This is in many ways advocating violence, vigilante-type taking thing into your own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine that - advocating vigilante-type violence against people that want to assault/kill you! SHOCKING!!! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Atlanta for 25 years and I have listened to Boortz almost every day since he has been on the air. I wish I would have recorded every time a black caller took up so much of his air time. He coddles them like a 4 year old. He will let the most unintelligent and unintelligible black ramble on for 10 or 15 minutes. Why? Because he is &#8220;race whipped!&#8221; He&rsquo;s like the store owner&rsquo;s son who never saw a black boy and handed him a piece of bubble gum under the counter just to win favor. <br>
Why did he all of a sudden lash out at the crime in Atlanta? Because it is there! He is not blind; only &#8220;race whipped!&#8221; This time, he spoke out a little more than normal. But, he will go back to his &#8220;place&#8221; and will continue to coddle the blacks that call. Believe me - Boortz is no friend of ours!  </p>

		<p>Graffiti is everywhere.  I was shocked when I arrived in Zurich, Switzerland in 1993 to see it all over the railway overpasses and tunnels.  And in Germany?  Don&rsquo;t get me started.  If you don&rsquo;t want to see it, move to the East where Turks and other &#8220;valuable&#8221; immigrants tend not to go.  They aren&rsquo;t exactly welcome there.</p>

		<p>As long as you don&rsquo;t live in an uber liberal state like Massachusetts or California, you have the right to defend yourself. In the Midwestern state where I live, no prosecutor would take on such an obvious case of self-defense and no jury would send a man to prison, should some nut-job prosecutor try. The old saying of preferring to be &#8220;judged by 12 than carried by 6&#8221; is more true than ever today. You can live as a man or you can live cowering in fear. The choice is yours.</p>

		<p>Is this the same Neil Boortz would only judge people on the size of their bank accounts? I remember listening to him years ago and he was quite agitated about &#8220;rednecks&#8221; who drove Cameros and lived in mobile homes because they committed the unpardonable sin of being poor and white. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned he should just hang at the country club with the hip hop mogels and count his money while knocking back 40&rsquo;s and getting a lap dance from a big booty ho. Blowhard indeed!</p>

		<p>The most interesting thing about Boortz&rsquo;s statement is that he didn&rsquo;t have to name the thugs&rsquo; ethnicity.  Everyone already knew who he was talking about because the huge number of criminal blacks has managed to create a bad impression of the entire group.  No newspaper has to do it.  <br>
It reminded me of something a family member said to me about 40 years ago.  Her son&rsquo;s bike had been stolen in a small city that was about 3% black.  The thief was caught.  &#8220;Of course he was black&#8221;, she commented.</p>

		<p>Agree with the previous post that Boortz is a blowhard.  What&rsquo;s more, by his comments over the years, he has shown that he despises common white people.  </p>
<p>He especially has an animus toward Palin whom he believes to represent the &#8220;white trash&#8221; element.  Conversely he heaps praise on Herman Cain who knows less about current events than Palin. But, you see Palin is white and Cain is black. </p>
<p>Boortz has repeatedly made fun of and ridiculed white southern speech, southern sheriffs, neo-confederates and their love of their battle flag and traditions.  Nor does he hesitate to point out, incorrectly, that serial killers are predominately white. These are but a few examples. </p>
<p>Boortz was in the vanguard of getting rid of the real Georgia state banner that contained the confederate battle flag. I got the feeling he did so because it was a popular trendy thing to do at the time and the battle fag represented the worst of the south to him.  And, by doing so he could suck up to blacks around Atlanta</p>
<p>Yes Boortz will criticize blacks, obliquely, but he will also kiss their butts if needed.  </p>
<p>It is true that Boortz has called out black criminality and buffoonery over the years.  But for me he will have turned a corner when he simply calls out blacks as &#8220;black criminals&#8221; instead of urban thugs.  Or, when he is totally honest and uses the N word on air. <br>
 <br>
By the way, Boortz is a war-hawk, like Newt, but when callers point out that he and Newt alike were missing in action during Vietnam he shouts them down. <br>

You may have a point but here&rsquo;s another scenario. Could it be that he lets them go on so that everyone gets the message about their stupidity?  Bob Grant of WABC New York used to do the same thing. It was a form of self indictment by their own mouths.</p>

		<p>My brother lives in the suburbs of Atlanta and he listens to Boortz from time to time. From what I gather, Boortz is right on some things and really off the ranch on others. Pointing out the truth is not racism, it is required for a society to continue functioning. Years ago on ABC news, Jeff Greenfield commented on Jesse Jackson stating that we need to do more about white collar crime. This was around the time of Michael Milken. Greenfield had the temerity to state that while most people have some fear of their life savings being embezzled, the thought of facing down teenage thugs with a gun is much more frightening. Hence this is why we hand out longer prison sentences for violent crime. </p>
<p>The area where he lives is turning into Detroit before his eyes and he is trying to figure out a way to leave Atlanta for good. At present, he is not upside down on his house, but if they continue to have shootings not far from his house, this will no longer be the case. I have encouraged him to move north; snow and ice last 3 months a year, criminal &#8220;youffs&#8221; are a problem 24/7/365. </p>

		<p>Boortz is often right on economics and he may finally be coming to his senses on blacks and crime. This change in orientation happens like coming out of a fog. I know personally, several white liberals, whose racial consciousness was awakened after being either directly or indirectly affected by black crime. It is because of black crime, more so than any other single factor, that the numbers of race realists continues to grow.</p>

<p>My wife and I, while visiting Rome and the Vatican, found LA style graffitti all over the place, INCLUDING on the inner dome of the Basillica and other places attached to the Vatican! There is a paint crew that goes around in the very early hours in Rome that paints over the stuff and Rome mostly smelled of fresh paint as my wife and I walked to such places as the Victor Emanual monument and the Coloseum (we stayed in a centrally located hotel) and again, graffitti was everywhere. ALSO! black African muslim were everywhere hustling cheap stuff and getting rude and threatening when we didn&rsquo;t buy from them, the Italians should get rid of the Africans, and heck, so should we.  </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right on.  I&rsquo;m in kind of a state of awe over the amount of whites who are now speaking out everywhere, not just Boortz.  As I posted on another story, I noticed on many newspaper comments sections that whites are raising holy hell.  If they did that before, I never noticed.  Is something changing?</p>
<p>As I stated before also, even Beck&rsquo;s The Blaze has very harsh comments posted by whites. http://goo.gl/e1sN5</p>
<p>I think we might have white competitors. I&rsquo;m going to post on that web site with the Amren web site&rsquo;s address.  We can always use more participation and members. </p>
