			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dean Malik, American Thinker, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The American motto &#8220;E Pluribus Unum&#8221; reflects the national aspiration that out of many diverse origins, we may become one people, with one culture, and one sole loyalty.  Fidelity to the American social compact  &mdash;  informed by the traditions and beliefs of this nation&rsquo;s founders  &mdash;  as opposed to race, ethnicity, or ancestry, is what binds us as people and what marks the metes and bounds of American culture.</p>
<p>No issue is more consequential to the cultural future of our nation, or more freighted with the potential for racial polarization, than immigration reform. {snip}</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the campaign for amnesty is the blatant plunge into identity politics by the movement&rsquo;s proponents. This strategy is made possible by the moral shift in this nation over the past half-century in which majoritarian (white) identity politics has been pushed to the fringes of the civil polity, while the political application of racial and ethnic solidarity by non-whites has been encouraged, governmentally subsidized, and incorporated into the American mainstream.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, prominent watchdog organizations maintain a catalogue of racist groups, many of which preach both racial superiority and separatism in an explicitly non-violent way.  Groups such as the Counsel of Conservative Citizens and the American Renaissance are featured alongside more vitriolic groups in the skinhead and Aryan Nations movement in offender registries.</p>
<p>However, racial advocacy in favor of comprehensive immigration reform is treated differently by society.</p>
<p>The driving force behind immigration reform is a collection of groups  which are commonly defined by their promotion of racial, ethnic, and otheridentity-based objectives.  The overarching &#8220;La Raza&#8221; movement, an amalgam of groups that purport to speak for Americans of Hispanic descent, has led the charge.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, unlike white racist organizations, which are properly subject to public contempt and typically appeal only to a small and malcontented segment of American society, MEChA and organizations like it are at the vanguard of progressive American politics. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The racial arguments for and against immigration reform are intellectually lazy, morally repugnant, and destructive to the national discourse.  What is truly at stake for our nation is culture, not race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Because we are bound together by a set of principles that transcend race, ethnicity, and national origin, our national unity requires an absolute fidelity to the covenant of American citizenship.  For immigrants, entry into the covenant begins with passage through our borders on terms set by the American people and codified under our immigration laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only by protecting our cultural foundation, embodied by shared traditions, ethics, and language, with neither racial prejudice nor racial passion, can we continually be ready for &#8220;the tremendous tasks of both war and peace.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Malik: &#8220;The racial arguments for and against immigration reform are intellectually lazy, morally repugnant, and destructive to the national discourse. What is truly at stake for our nation is culture, not race.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is naive, bordering on insanity, to think that culture and race are independent features of human biodiversity and thus that any race can inherit and preserve the culture of liberty and rule of law created by the American founding fathers.  Famed humanitarian Albert Schweitzer made this observation in particularly poignant fashion as regards his work in Africa:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given my life to alleviate the sufferings of Africa. There is something that all White men who have lived here like I have must learn and know: that these individuals are a sub-race. They have neither the mental or emotional abilities to equate or share equally with White men in any functions of our civilization. I have given my life to try to bring unto them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status: White the superior, and they the inferior. For whenever a White man seeks to live among them as their equals, they will destroy and devour him, and they will destroy all his work. And so for any existing relationship or any benefit to this people, let White men, from anywhere in the world, who would come to help Africa, remember that you must maintain this status: you the master and they the inferior, like children whom you would help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals. Never accept them as your social equals or they will devour you. They will destroy you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My African Notebook 1961 - A. Schweitzer</p>
<p>Dr Albert Schweitzer, philanthropist humanitarian, naturalist and reknown for founding the Lambarene Hospital, Niger. Today almost fifty years later these words are still true, but are ignored disregarded or forgotten under a tide of liberalism, political correctness, denial and apathy&hellip;<br/>

		<p>Dean Malik is living in a fantasy land. Raced-based nationalism has always been the the norm because&hellip;well&hellip;it&rsquo;s normal. Malik wants to have a big happy multiracial family that will go on occupying the middle east for an indefinite period of time. The &#8220;US&#8221; population is exploding right before our eyes..and this a 100 percent a direct consequence of importing post-1965 high fertility nonwhites. There is  a massive unmitigated environmental catastrophe on the horizon.  &#8220;America&#8221; will be broken up into heavily armed race-based nation states all fighting over the scarce resources of the former America.</p>
<p>I want the Hispanics,Muslims,Asians, Carribeans and Nigerians out of America. I do not recognize them as American. Libertarians such as Dean Malik have been cheerleaders for the America destroying post-1965 Immigration policy. He knew exactly what he was doing. And now he is scared that White Americans might very likely reclaim their living space stolen by high fetility post-1965 nonwhites. Too bad.</p>

<p>Another lying, pathetic statement. </p>
<p>The only way we become ONE people is to come from ONE racial line made up of different nationalities, that form the WHITE RACE. It was NEVER meant for different RACES of people to form ONE people or culture! </p>
<p>We had better start educating our children and grandchildren to this fact as all they hear is the out and out lies from our schools, media, and so-called &#8220;scholars&#8221;. </p>

<p>WRONG..We are bound together by a shared culture, a shared history..and these things have a strong ethno racial component..we never noticed how strong because for 400 years<br/>
we were nearly all European. Explain if you can why blacks<br/>
have been &#8220;legally&#8221; citizens for 150 years..and still endless<br/>
the division and tension wont go away.</p>

		<p>Dean Malick is a Pakistani &#8220;American&#8221; married to a Pakistani &#8220;American&#8221;. So we know that his allegiance is not to the historic American Nation-Native Born White America. Pakistani &#8220;Americans&#8221; have no racial-ethnic connection to the historic American Nation. Therefore, the race-replacement of the historic Native Born White  American Nation is not something that he finds disturbing. In fact, he is obvious cheerleader for our  race-replacement. </p>
<p>Thought experiment:Pakistani &#8220;American&#8221; Civil War reenactors reacting the battle of Gettysburg. </p>
<p><br/>
But this is what the Republican Party  is sending out into the world for poltical office. Let&rsquo;s face, Malick is essentially a foriegner&hellip;even if he was born here.</p>
<p>And yes, he served in the &#8220;US&#8221; military in Iraq and is fanatically pro-war. Pro-war goes hand-in-hand with the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority.</p>

<p><br/>
This next paragraph is pure bull manure.   We are NOT a nation built by, or FOR, the ideas of being a credal nation, which is a neo-con concocted pile of bull designed to provide a cover for their diabolically evil lust to genocide the White European founding stock of America by burying them under an avalanche of hostile, resentful, less intelligent, less capable, less ambitious, less talented, but far more subservient aliens who share absolutely NOTHING with the white founding stock of this nation, which was founded and created by our 100 PERCENT WHITE European founding fathers and ancestors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The racial arguments for and against immigration reform are intellectually lazy, morally repugnant, and destructive to the national discourse. What is truly at stake for our nation is culture, not race.&#8221;</p>
<p>News Flash:  Culture is defined as race gone to seed.   Our Western culture is the product of WHITE racial ingenuity and innovation; it did NOT sprout from the African or Mexican or from any other Third World nation&rsquo;s ethnic stock. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we are bound together by a set of principles that transcend race, ethnicity, and national origin, our national unity requires an absolute fidelity to the covenant of American citizenship. For immigrants, entry into the covenant begins with passage through our borders on terms set by the American people and codified under our immigration laws.&#8221; </p>
<p>To educate yourself on where this sick and mentally twisted pile of rancid &#8216;credal nation&rsquo; ideological baloney originated from, read the linked article,  which was written back in January 18, 2008 by traditional conservative John O&rsquo;Sullivan. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/223411/after-reaganism/flashback?page=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/223411/after-reaganism/flashback?page=7</a></p>
<p>Here is the opening paragraph:</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a third utopian obstacle to such directness: namely, the neoconservative belief that America is not a country, but an idea  &mdash;  a &ldquo;credal nation&rdquo; held together not by ethnic links, cultural sympathies, or shared historical memories, but by conscious subscription to the liberal political ideas outlined in the Declaration of Independence and entrenched in the Constitution. Because being an American is a matter of believing these ideas, the country is thought to be capable of absorbing and assimilating people from different cultures in limitless numbers. America is the first universal nation, in Ben Wattenberg&rsquo;s phrase, and everyone in the world is a potential American.&#8221;</p>
<p>This entire &#8216;credal nation&rsquo; ideology was, as I stated earlier, designed to become a cloak under which these anti-white neo-cons could engineer the ethnic, racial, and cultural GENOCIDE of the White European founding stock of America.</p>
<p>I say it&rsquo;s time for genocide trials to begin.</p>

<p>No, that is what they want us to think. </p>
<p>&#8220;THEY&#8221; want to replace the White founding population of the USA. All this talk of how the Dems want votes and the Repubs want cheap labor is just another cover up of what is really going on. Time to learn who runs BOTH parties and in essence our country.</p>

<p>Thanks for informing is that he&rsquo;s a Pakistani.  Another arrogant subcontinenter for whom I have no use is Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza   &mdash;   In his book, <i>The End of Racism</i>, he insinuated that black African kingdoms in western Africa were qualitatively superior to and more desirable than Western Europe in 1500.  I have heard but have not yet been able to substantiate that D&rsquo;Souza pressured and lobbied the Washington Times to cut Sam Francis loose.</p>
<p>So there you go   &mdash;   We let all these arrogant subcontinenters immigrate into the United States out of the &#8220;goodness of our hearts,&#8221; and the thanks we get is to hear them tell us easily refutable lies about how us NBWAs (shorthand for your favorite phrase) were inconsequential all along to the American narrative, and that our people used to be such backward primitives that as late as 511 years ago, we were inferior to the very group of people whom we would help enslave and colonialize a mere 150 years after that point in time.</p>
