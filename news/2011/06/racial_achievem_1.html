<h1>Racial Achievement Gap Persists at Wake Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>T. Keung Hui, NewsObserver, June 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wake County school board members agreed Saturday to set new goals for improving minority student performance after a report showing that the state&rsquo;s largest school district isn&rsquo;t closing its racial achievement gap.</p>
<p>Superintendent Tony Tata told board members that a new outside audit shows that Wake hasn&rsquo;t closed the achievement gap on state exams between white students and minority students. The new audit draws different conclusions from internal reports showing that the gap has narrowed in Wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is &hellip; there has been no reduction in the achievement gap in the last three or four years, so that tells us we&rsquo;ve got to do something to get after that,&#8221; Tata said at Saturday&rsquo;s school board retreat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tata will consult staff and principals before coming back to the board with &#8220;reasonable&#8221; targets for each racial and ethnic group. He said he&rsquo;d also discuss what impact meeting those individual goals would have on Wake&rsquo;s overall achievement.</p>

		<p>Wake County (NC) Public Schools has plenty of company. The most succinct definition of the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; was furnished by Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Education Trust, &ldquo;Closing the Achievement Gap,&rdquo; National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>
https://tinyurl.com/2d6sayq</p>
<p>Note the conditional &ldquo;if they do so [reach 12th grade] at all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Those words means that the black-white achievement gap is &ldquo;four years&rdquo; for the above-average contingent of black students still in school by 12th grade. The below-average contingent of black students (half of the age cohort) have already dropped out. </p>
<p>The government school systems have obsessed over &#8220;closing the gap&#8221; for four decades   &mdash;  - to no discernible effect, save lowering the verbal proficiency of high achieving white students.</p>
<p>On BookTV.org, last year E. D. Hirsch Jr., [referring to a chart showing the average Verbal SAT score falling about 40 points from 1967 - 2002], pointed out:</p>
<p>&#8220;The absolute number of students who scored above 600 declined by 56 percent and the absolute number of students who scored above 650 declined by 73 percent. A sudden influx of black and Hispanic test-takers cannot explain why large numbers of college-bound middle-class white students suddenly became less proficient. That is what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hirsch did not say this but it is obvious: As America has become more diverse, far fewer whites are scoring above 600 on the Verbal SATs. Diversity is correlated with declining achievement   &mdash;  - at least for whites.</p>
<p>Much of the decline in white verbal proficiency in recent decades can probably be accounted for by the effect of the ideology of multiculturalism on history and literature instruction. Textbooks are a good example. Diane Ravitch&rsquo;s THE LANGUAGE POLICE: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003) is a fine contribution toward understanding how public school textbooks are rendered virtually unreadable.</p>

<p>What excuse hasn&rsquo;t been made and what hasn&rsquo;t been tried?</p>
<p>Desegregated schools. Free breakfasts. Free lunches. Black teachers. Black principles. Black school boards. Black superintendents. Critical mass. Lead abatement. New schools. Computers and high-tech learning. Afro-centric curricula. Mentoring. Special and remedial classes.  </p>
<p>When do these people see, or more accurately, admit the truth?</p>
<p>The answer is never so long as they can generate more theories and excuses.</p>

		<p>They call it &#8220;Achievement Gap&#8221; because they want you to believe that blacks have equal capacity to achieve as Whites do. </p>
<p>They want you to believe a lie, just like they demand you believe all men are created equal and diversity is our strength.</p>
<p>By using &#8220;Achievement,&#8221; they can say that if blacks fall behind, it must be the fault of Whites.  Punish the Whites through higher taxes and eliminating advanced classes.  Keep Whitey down to the black level, and gap closes.</p>
<p>An also give diversity points to blacks who apply to college.  Make it easier for them to be admitted, or just openly admit them, and then promote them to diversity leadership positions on campus so they will be powerful and Whitey girls will find them desirable to date in the coed dorms. </p>

		<p>Well I thought they HAD come up with a solution. Just bring all academic standards down to the same level as these minorities and pretend all ethnic groups share the same intelligence. I mean that IS the point for a lot of schools doing away with honors classes right? So these same minorities can feel good about themselves?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m taking my 4th grade son to be tested this Thursday for AG classes for 5th grade after his teacher referred him. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see the racial makeup of all the other students there testing, and I have a feeling they will be mostly white children. If that&rsquo;s the case, I suspect AG classes to go by the way side as well.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the author of this article is from the ethnic group commonly referred to as Han; that is, Chinese. So I began to wonder if T. Keung Wui was in any way worried about the achievement gap between Whites and Chinese, and I suppose the even wider learning gap between the Chinese and the Blacks/Puerto Ricans/Mexicans. Just a thought. </p>

		<p>The Rich Right think the future lies in places like China, India, Indonesia and Mexico. Where engineers with Bachelors level competencies and Master level purchased degrees are paid 10-15,000 dollars a year equivalent salaries. And 85 IQ laborers put together the resulting junk designs for $2.00 a day.</p>
<p>If they honestly believed that _their money_ was at risk via removal of white social benefits from the middle class, do you think it would take these people more than a hot minute to find a reason to break with their traditional, leftist, enemy and INSIST that our privileges be maintained?</p>
<p>Do think that polar-labels like &lsquo;left and right&rsquo; are even -real- when the only truth that matters is Rich And Poor?</p>
<p>The reality is that the middle class is a wealth-class maker. And the cumulatancy of this process, which is largely white, has made America top-heavy. We live longer, healthier, lives. Control our reproductive replacement and population expansion. Spend less and so have less volume turnover. Are smarter in our achievable prospects.</p>
<p>All of which makes the -existing- wealth classes less money through currency volume movements of consumer economics.</p>
<p>Than a nation full of dumb, high TFR, junk consumers who spend every paycheck as soon as they get it can create.</p>
<p>Remember, the rich don&rsquo;t think in terms of sustaining resources. Only maintaining money.</p>
<p>Elevating the &lsquo;Ethnically Underprivileged&rsquo; thus occurs solely because the wealthy KNOW, genetically, that this is not going to change or threaten their class status as a function of social bandaiding a river of blacks or hispanics into the country club.</p>
<p>And the reason they know this (keeping in mind that real genetic science is at least 25 years ahead of the public&rsquo;s awareness) is because everyone&rsquo;s children are statistically more likely to fall towards the racial mean than their own achieved level.</p>
<p>Whites, blacks, hispanics, asians. Every parent is going to produce a kid more shifted towards the racial mean. So unless you are retarded, that generally means a downwards slide. How far is where racial genetic truths start to bite particularly blacks, in the backside of the bell curve.</p>
<p>If you are a 135 IQ white (</p>
<p>135+118 = 247/2 = 127-100(/2) + 100 = ca. 113 IQ for your children. Which is still nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>But if you are a 125 IQ black (</p>
<p>125+94/2 = 110-87(/2) = 11 + 87 = ca. 98 IQ. Which is a LARGE &lsquo;achievement gap&rsquo; intelligence drop to sustain, let alone continue to build, wealth from.</p>
<p>It is because of these self-sabotaging genetics outcomes that _class is heritable only for whites with our innate conservative behaviors_.</p>
<p>The elites thus believe they can &lsquo;manage the herd&rsquo; of other ethnies whom they seek to replace us with while sustaining a wage slave system that effectively enables capitalism (and thus wealth for the wealthy class) as a whole.</p>
<p>The question you have to ask and answer for yourself is whether &lsquo;the system&rsquo; of capitalist self-achievement, which is obviously now rigged to create only a small percentage proportion of population as wealthy-class beneficiaries, is worth conserving.</p>
<p>When the alternative: genomic therapy for everyone, can give us _all_ 125 baseline IQs. And the blacks will no longer have the excuse of permanent victim status to leach off us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the genetics people. It&rsquo;s ALWAYS been in the genetics. And if we all benefit equally from genetic engineering as genomic therapy (thereby avoiding the &lsquo;Nazi Superman&rsquo; phobia which our elites like to whip-hand us with at the drop of a hat/e), we don&rsquo;t have to face the alternative: a cheek by jowl existence and miscegenative interbreeding with those whose native behaviors and appearance we find repulsive. And whose _genetics_ will sabotage ours. Utterly and forever. If we don&rsquo;t live apart from them.</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t like us, any more than we do them. The stay near us, because they need our intelligence. The day that changes, the world will be a happier place.</p>
<p>In the process, we will also break our elite&rsquo;s iron grip over the &lsquo;common man&rsquo; mindset. Because you cannot communicate advanced collegiate conceptual ideas to a GED brain. But you also can&rsquo;t hold down a 125 IQ that doesn&rsquo;t want to live in a service society of burger flippers.<br>

<p>How well you do in school depends almost entirely on your IQ. The reason there is an achievement gap is because there is an IQ gap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the fault of blacks that they have the lowest IQ of all humans, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they should be fooled into believing that IQ doesn&rsquo;t exist or doesn&rsquo;t matter. Equal opportunity for all, not forced equality for the intellectually inferior .<br>

<p>I have the solution for meeting the &ldquo;gifted black&rdquo; quota. Dark skinned Indians are often darker than Blacks but we have high IQs and strong work ethic so let&rsquo;s start classifying ourselves as &ldquo;black&rdquo; based on skin color in order to meet quotas. Blacks say skin color= races so let&rsquo;s prove it!<br>

<p>In Washington, D.C., Atlanta, GA and several other locations they have overcome the achievement gap by erasing and correcting the answers on tests and other means of falsifying student proficiency. Why can&rsquo;t other predominantly Black regions get on board with this method of closing the gap so we can quit throwing funds at proven lost causes and start channeling the funds to deserving White and Asian students who inherited the ability to use their brains.</p>
<p>We are all very much aware that most Blacks who make it to college don&rsquo;t deserve to be there, and we fully understand that the 50% that graduate from college didn&rsquo;t earn their diplomas. For that reason we should just start giving diplomas to all Blacks at birth so we can use our resources for educating the intelligent races.<br>

		<p>Since the goal is to narrow the achievement gap between blacks and whites, with no mention of the degree of achievement, the obvious solution is to stop teaching whites so much. This can be done by reducing the amount of information taught to the level that can be learned by all students.</p>

		<p>Since the basic tenet of our society and government is that &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221; and that the amount of melanin in the skin is the only differentiating factor among racial groups - assuming the extreme position that race is a social construct is not taken - then it&rsquo;s obvious that somehow further social engineering or educational changes will allow the results of educational achievement to be nearly the same for all ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Growing numbers of individuals, such as those who post on &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; and other sites, are recognizing objectively that this is not the case and that &#8220;the emperor has no clothes.&#8221; Hopefully there will be a watershed point some time in the future, likely when an even more serious economic downturn takes place, when the saying &#8220;you can&rsquo;t fool all of the people all of the time&#8221; will finally kick in. At that point people of European descent in the United States, and other majority European background countries as well, will be ready to listen to new voices of leadership, such as that of Jared Taylor. Only then will the true political changes needed be possible to occur.</p>

		<p>The only thing that can be done is to STOP NATIONALLY TESTING BLACK STUDENTS.  There&rsquo;s no more money to be wasted on fancy schools, the newest laptops, or even garden plots.  Some black educators, in fact, have suggested that we basically leave blacks alone to run their own schools and stop comparing the scores of blacks to whites and Asians.</p>

<p><i>A sudden influx of black and Hispanic test-takers cannot explain why large numbers of college-bound middle-class white students suddenly became less proficient.</i></p>
<p>AND, this is AFTER the SAT was re-normed and &#8220;re-centered&#8221; (read dumbed down) in 1996 specifically so the scores of &#8220;persons of color&#8221; would be higher in relation to Whites.  The dreaded and difficult &#8220;antonym&#8221; section was removed from the verbal portion replaced by &#8220;Critical Reading&#8221;, for the math component,   free-response questions were added, and students are now allowed to use calculators.</p>
<p>Guess it didn&rsquo;t work out the way the educational &#8216;experts&rsquo; thought it would   &mdash;   but what billion-dollar program that they&rsquo;ve pushed on the schools ever has?</p>
<p>Charles Murray, in the journal, <i>The American</i>, writes the following about the SAT test:</p>
<p><i>Today&rsquo;s SAT, has eliminated the highly g-loaded analogy items and added a writing component that carries with it a multitude of scoring problems.</i></p>
<p><i>Originally, the point of the SAT &mdash; whose initials, after all, stood for Scholastic Aptitude Test &mdash; was to measure aptitude, defined by the dictionary as &#8216;inherent ability,&rsquo; rather than to measure academic achievement.</i></p>
<p>The SAT test has been re-christened as the &#8220;Scholastic <b>Assessment</b> Test.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The College Board [does not want] to reveal just how well the original SATs measure the general mental factor g and the College Board does not want to acknowledge that the SAT measures g at all or, for that matter, that g even exists.</i></p>

		<p>They need to provide:</p>
<p>Free Breakfast<br>
Free Lunch<br>
Free Snacks<br>
Free Diner</p>
<p>and Black teachers for the students to relate to&hellip;.how do you expect a proud young black man to learn from a white teacher? Whites can&rsquo;t relate to young black men and thus he will not be able read or write in such a hostile environment.</p>
<p>They need classes taught in the dialect of young black men. Teachers today sound too &#8220;white&#8221;. Math itself needs to be taught in an ethnic way and chemistry is way, way to &#8220;white&#8221;. </p>
<p>I hope this schools looks at the sports gap on their teams. Are white boys falling behind in scoring and points made? Is there a gap in the results of sports? I certainly hope their football and basket ball team shows they are inclusive and permit young white boys to have equal time on the field.</p>

		<p>Poster #2 said:  &#8220;Hirsch did not say this but it is obvious: As America has become more diverse, far fewer whites are scoring above 600 on the Verbal SATs. Diversity is correlated with declining achievement  &mdash;  at least for whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;   I live where there are a lot of lower class white ethnics in certain neighborhoods.  They live by a weird mixture of guido-ness and gangsta rap.  Their vocabulary is horrible.  </p>
<p>There is nothing more disconcerting than to see a crowd of WHITE-skinned boys with sagging pants, sideways baseball caps, a shuffling gait and acting like they just stepped out of a thug-rap video.</p>

		<p>The only way to close the &#8216;achievement gap&rsquo; is to intentionally hobble the best and brightest (read Whites and east Asians). </p>
<p>Sadly, a Harrison Bergeron world where the Handicapper General cripples each and every one of us to the lowest common level is almost inevitable, all in the name of closing this obvious and natural &#8216;potential gap&rsquo;. </p>
<p>What I really love about Affermative Action is the fact that it baldly admits that they cannot compete on a level playing field.</p>
