<h1>Malikah Shabazz, Malcolm X&rsquo;s Daughter, Pleads Guilty to Stealing 70 Year-Old&rsquo;s Identity</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, June 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A daughter of slain civil rights leader Malcolm X has pleaded guilty to stealing the identity of an elderly family friend to run up more than $55,000 in credit card bills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Queens prosecutors say the 46-year-old used the name of a 70-year-old woman whose late husband was one of Malcolm X&rsquo;s bodyguards to acquire credit cards that Shabazz used to run up big debts.</p>

		<p>We are deeply offended that Whiteys forced the afrovoodoo blacks to adopt the White language.  What could be worse than forcing a race to abandon its language, religion, and customs for the sake of the master class?   </p>
<p>Time for us to offer a real Emancipation  to the blacks: You are free to speak your own afrovoodoo language, and you are free to go home to afrovoodooland where you will never again be offended by the Confederate flag.</p>

		<p>Remember, back in 1997, Malcolm X&rsquo;s (legally Malcolm Shabazz) grandson, Malcolm Shabazz III, arsonized the house that X&rsquo;s widow (Betty Shabazz) was in at the time, the fire killed her.  I think Mr. Shabazz III was 12 years old at the time.</p>
<p>What is interesting here is that Malcolm X&rsquo;s wife, daughter and grandson never used the &#8220;X&#8221; moniker, instead opting for the &#8220;Shabazz&#8221; surname.</p>

		<p>I think this is the same X daughter that got arrested by the FBI in Minnesota in 1995 for trying to hire a federal confidential informant to kill Louis Farrakhan. The charges were dismissed after her lawyers pleaded &#8220;not guilty by reason of dat&rsquo;s raciss&#8221;.</p>
<p>Immediately after the charges were dropped she had a long meeting with Farrakhan, then she faded from public view.  </p>

		<p>I read the original article at the liberal Huffington Post and was pleasantly surprised to see most of the commentaries were lambasting her slimy father.</p>
<p>At least some Americans haven&rsquo;t been brainwashed by rp.c. history  and a crappy Malcolm X biopic. </p>

<p>Her brother, Malcom Shabazz III, who killed his grandmother, is still trying to find himself.</p>

<p>But I thought the NoI was supposed to be AGAINST black-on-black crime? Someone surnamed &#8220;X&#8221; should surely be directing their mischief toward what Malcolm called &#8220;that pale old thing&#8221; the white man, rather than at a fellow black (and family friend)? </p>
<p>Even so, this latest victim of mayhem by the Shabazz Family didn&rsquo;t suffer nearly so badly as Malcolm X&rsquo;s own widow, Betty Shabazz. Being swindled out of a five-figure sum is highly annoying, to be sure   &mdash;   but being burned to death (she only died of her burns a painful MONTH after the housefire) is obviously much, much worse. </p>

I clicked on that tinyurl from poster #8 Urban Teacher. It&rsquo;s an article from the Truthseekers site, in which a black writer bends over backwards to apologize and make excuses and allowances for Malcolm X&rsquo;s grandson, Malcolm Shabazz III, having set fire to the house of Malcolm X&rsquo;s widow, Betty Shabazz, when the grandson was 12. </p>
<p>Within that article, the author makes a linguistic mistake that qualifies as one of the most hilarious &#8220;Freudian slips&#8221; I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Better yet, the mistake is in the &#8220;pull quote&#8221; highlighted in larger type size on the left column of the page. I have set the word in question in CAPS: </p>
<p><br/>
<i>At age 23, it&rsquo;s impossible to speculate what Malcolm Shabazz will become. [&hellip;] And in many ways it&rsquo;s unfair to ask these types of questions of Malcolm Shabazz, nor expect him to IMMOLATE his grandfather in any way.</i></p>
<p><br/>
Evidently, the word the writer wanted was &#8220;emulate&#8221; (to imitate; to act similar to). But somehow it came out as &#8220;immolate&#8221; (to set on fire; to burn)! </p>
<p>Well, Truthseekers, I think we can rule out the possibility that the now-23-year-old Malcolm Shabazz III might &#8220;immolate&#8221; his famous grandfather Malcolm X, as Malcolm X was assassinated (by his fellow Black Muslims, and NOT by Whitey) way back in 1965. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t really immolate people who&rsquo;ve been dead almost half-a-century. </p>

<p>Wow, that is funny &#8220;We can&rsquo;t expect Malcolm Shabazz to immolate his grandfather&hellip;&#8221; No, but he did immolate his Grandmother.</p>
<p>The article said that this violent young lunatic&rsquo;s dad was an Algerian Muslim.  The Religion Of Peace strikes again. </p>

<p>Probably because &#8220;Shabazz&#8221; sounds a bit more black than &#8220;X&#8221;</p>
