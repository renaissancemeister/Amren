<h1>Mexicans Protest Against Alabama&rsquo;s New Anti-Illegal Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Ramstack, All Headline News, June 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Outrage continued Friday in Mexico a day after Alabama&rsquo;s governor signed the toughest law in the United States against illegal immigration.<br>
 <br>
The law would impose criminal penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants, give local police broad powers to arrest anyone they suspect of entering the United States without a visa and compel public schools to check the immigration status of students.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement expressing &#8220;deep concern&#8221; over Alabama law HB 56. The statement said the law could violate the civil rights of Mexicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other provisions of HB 56 make it illegal to knowingly rent housing to illegal immigrants and prohibit businesses from claiming tax deductions on wages they pay employees who lack work permits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexican government&rsquo;s hint of legal action is part of a growing activism among Latin American countries against states that crack down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 14 Latin American countries joined in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief to oppose a Utah law against illegal immigration. They filed the brief in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The amicus brief from the Latin American countries argued the law was unconstitutional because it could lead to racial profiling of Hispanics.</p>
<p>The brief was filed on behalf of the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.</p>

		<p>Latin American knows that diversity is our achilles heel, and they take advantage of it.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, they do have much stricter immigrations laws than us for sure. but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. They don&rsquo;t need to respect us or our laws, and we don&rsquo;t expect them to. </p>
<p>Our political elites are afraid of their own shadow. Don&rsquo;t expect Alabama&rsquo;s new law to be enforced or even affirmed at a higher court when challenged.  </p>

		<p>Oh Yes, the tired old, overused excuse of how it will violate &#8220;civil rights&#8221;. How much longer will this insufferable device be used against what is lawful and decent? These types of experiences are only sending me further down the road towards becoming a VERY angry white man. Marxism has such a stranglehold on this country that it is becoming unbearable. What hypocrisy for Mexico, of all countries, to lodge a complaint in light of how they treat the Guatemalans at their southern border. I live in Alabama and every person that I talk with regarding this new law is absolutely ecstatic about it!! Good job Governor Bentley and the Alabama legislature for your courage!!!! VIVA AMERICA!!!!</p>

		<p>So, these countries have in effect declared war on white Americans by challenging this law. They clearly want white Americans dispossesed then dead, and they also think that wherever their demon spawn go so does the vile, corrupt nation that begat them. That is all I am concerned about, and the threat these vile, sadistic, ignorant, uneducated, pedophilic, violent invaders pose to me and mine. I get hate stares from them all of the time, and I return the favor.Let these illegal aliens protest, the police here in my area love to swing night sticks and shoot suspects. One black thug was the target of no fewer than 60 9mm bullets after a chase and shootout with police, and he&rsquo;s dead. It will be the same with these Mexcians if they try to riot here in my city because of gunfire from police and whites defending their selves, families and homes. When these countries attempt to interfere in our internal politics, law and political process, that is an attack and an act of war against white Americans. The very fact they are doing this shows the law has real teeth in it, and that at least some politicians in Alabama really do care about the interests of native born whites, who otherwise have three very bad possible futures. One is being genocided out of existance. Another is to be reduced to a hated, oppressed, persecuted and dispossed minority. The third is to resort to violent revolution with the goal of seizing back at least part of our former homeland and likely the extermination or expulsion of all Hispanics from a new ethnostate. Our race can&rsquo;t really afford any of these dire scenarios, therefore the time to act is now. I think the governor of my state of Alabama clearly believes this.</p>

		<p>Is anyone surprised that Mexicans are protesting Alabama&rsquo;s law?<br>
They want the following:<br>
1. We demand the right to break into your country<br>
2. We are entitled to the bounty of taxpayers hard work<br>
3. We must be given the same benefits as legal citizens<br>
4. Our children must be given instant ctizenship<br>
5. We must be schooled and medicated at taxpayer expense<br>
6. And we want r-e-s-p-e-c-t, no matter what we do.</p>
<p>After all, this and the last few administrations have told them they are entitled!</p>

		<p>The mass emigration of its people to the U. S. is the Mexican government&rsquo;s main &#8220;solution&#8221; to the poverty it has done so much to create in Mexico. </p>
<p>Mexico has many quasi-monopolies in vital services. These keep prices high. They make the nation uncompetitive.  Most notably, however, they maintain a parasitic class of multi-millionaires and billionaires. Mexico has 11 billionaires, including the world&rsquo;s third richest man, Carlos Slim, worth an estimated $74 billion.</p>
<p>Professor George W. Grayson, senior associate, Center for Strategic and International Studies, elaborated on the dynamics of super-wealth and crushing poverty in Mexico in an appearance on Lou Dobbs in 2007: </p>
<p>&#8220;Lou, Mexico&rsquo;s elites live like maharajas. But they spend extremely little on education and health care and transportation to upgrade the quality of their citizens. They pay about  &mdash;  as a percent of gross domestic product  &mdash;  the same percentage that Haiti pays, 10.4 percent. So as a result, even though it&rsquo;s an immensely wealthy country  &mdash;  gold, silver, beaches, oil &hellip; they prefer to neglect their problems at home, turn a blind eye to them, and let U.S. taxpayers pick up the tab.&#8221; </p>
<p>The U.S., you see, is the maharajas&rsquo; safety value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way the Mexican elite want it.  That&rsquo;s the way the America&rsquo;s elite want it.  </p>
<p>The two organizations most effective in combatting the American and Mexican elites are NumberUSA.com, which is famed for its &#8220;Action Buffet,&#8221; which makes it easy to contact state and federal legistators when legislation is pending, AND the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Fairus.org, known for its research and technical assistance to communities and states resisting the federal government&rsquo;s efforts to dispossess native-born Americans.</p>
<p>The web sites most effective in exposing the elite immigration agenda is VDARE.com (a daily incisive essay and an indispensable blog) and AmericanPatrol.com, known for its daily listing of immigration reports/articles.<br>

<p>Ler&rsquo;s see now, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile are whiter (more Caucasian) than the US. Costa Rica is just about as white as the US. How can this be? Until 1948 Limon Province Afro-Carribeans could travel no further into the interior of Costa Rica than Turrialba (half-way on train line between the Atlantic coast and San Jose (VERY White capital city) And these governments pretend to pontificate about racism to the US courts??</p>

<p>I got a better idea why doesn&rsquo;t the US sue Mexico and other Latin countries for a numerous of things like bleed the US for its own personal gain?</p>

		<p>The governments and citizens of Mexico, Central America and South America, have no right to have any say-so whatsoever as to the laws in OUR nation. <br>
We need to slam the borders shut, and deport any and all illegals from whatever Latin American country. Shoot on sight the next ones caught trying to slither in, whether it be on foot, by land, or by air. <br>
This is nothing less than an invasion of what used to be the sovereign nation of the United States. They need to put up and shut up. (Incidentally, the US needs to stop meddling in their governments and internal disputes, too.)  </p>

		<p>this is absured that foreign govts are filing law suits to alter our countries laws.  Our leadership in DC has to be the most gutless bunch of criminal incompetents we have ever had to allow this to go on.  All american white males need to realize that the president and the attorny general are not white and will not act to protect white folk from attacks by the so called minorities, regardless if the acts are at voting places or in courts.  further white males need to realize that the supreme court judges can be impeached they are not untouchables.  Obama can be impeached for treason.  Deliberately allowing the low key invasion of the US by foreign peoples can be taken as an act of treason.  They can be legally removed from office if you have the backbone to do so.  We live in interesting times.</p>

		<p>The Latin American governments would make better use of their efforts if they tried to make their countries better places to live. The fact that they&rsquo;re fighting for the right of their citizens to leave Latin America speaks volumes about how well those governments are running their countries, along with the fact that so many Latin Americans are fleeing their homelands.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why Argentina and Uruguay are joining this legal action against Utah? These two countries especially Argentina are very European in population. Buenos Aires is somewhere around 50% citizens of Italian heritage.<br>

		<p>What bothers me the most about Western Governments is that they frame colonialism, as civil rights issues. When Europeans colonize and improve a continent, it&rsquo;s evil. When backwards 3rd World people invade, it&rsquo;s a noble endeavor. </p>
<p>Just why exactly did European people fight two major wars?<br>
If sovereignty can be ceded so easily, why did they fight so ardently and at such great cost to preserve their borders?</p>
<p>Well bravo Alabama anyways,<br>
 it&rsquo;s a start&hellip;&hellip;</p>

does that mean that these countries don&rsquo;t have immigration laws and they let in everybody? (like they expect us to), or does it mean they are looking out for the interests of their RAZA? (like they are trying to prevent us from doing).<br>
it is a territory war, and that is why other countries are attacking States for trying to protect their legal citizens!</p>

		<p>Do you know the Mexicans and white bleeding hearts out here in Az. have gathered enough votes for a recall of Sen Russel Pearce?</p>
<p>The founder of SB1070? (He also was looking at a very similar law as that of the great state of Alabama.) These horrible illegals and their fellow country men are mad because 99% of taxpayer&rsquo;s have had enough of supporting them! If he get&rsquo;s voted out, I&rsquo;m packing up and moving to Alabama! Sounds like my kinda state. Maybe all White Americans should consider the same and we&rsquo;ll make a stand there!</p>

		<p>The politicians and leaders of Mexico are amazing hypocrits. They have a large nation with vast resources,including coastlines, and so many advantages that other nations would envy, yet they are miserably poor. The truth is,the Mexican leadership want things that way. All one needs to do is look at pictures of the palace where their politicians do business, it has all kinds of limousines and mercedes cars parked everywhere. The Monetary economies of nations are determined by the will of the elite. They decide whether to have inflation or a strong currency, even in the U.S. Mexicans are in poverty not because of Americans demand for drugs,or American interventionism, or the impact of foreign markets, but because of other Mexicans in Mexico.</p>
