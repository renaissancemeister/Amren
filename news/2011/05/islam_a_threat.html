<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The presence of Muslims in Canada threatens the country&rsquo;s freedoms and democracy, and only if immigration from Islamic countries is suspended can the cultural deterioration of the country be stopped, controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders told a packed house Monday night in Toronto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Western culture is far superior to Islamic culture,&#8221; Mr. Wilders said. &#8220;And only once we are convinced of this will we be able to defend our civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event, held at the Canadian Christian College in north Toronto, marked Mr. Wilders&rsquo; second stop on a three-city tour. The visit, his first to Canada, is sponsored by the International Free Press Society.</p>
<p>He spoke in London on Sunday, and he will be in Ottawa on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Charles McVety, president of the Christian College, introduced Mr. Wilders to an ebullient crowd as a man with &#8220;a prophetic message.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of Party for Freedom, the third party in the Dutch parliament, Mr. Wilders is better known for his uncompromising position on Islam. His vitriol against the religion has necessitated the hiring of 24-hour personal security for the past seven years.</p>
<p>In his speech on Monday night, he said Muslim immigrants to Europe have changed the social and political landscape there. An increasingly vociferous Islamic lobby has led to the harassment of Christians, female genital mutilation and polygamy, he said, adding that with its own growing Muslim community, Canada faces the same fate.</p>
<p>His career has been driven by a belief that the Koran encourages violence, that moderate Islam is an impossibility and that in allowing Muslims to immigrate to Western nations, these countries open themselves up to inevitable Islamization.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need the spirit of resistance to this evil,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is our moral duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Oren Wry was not entirely convinced. Sitting in the seventh row, the teenager does not identify as a critic of Islam, but said there are elements of Mr. Wilders&rsquo; ideas that intrigue him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geert has some harsh ideas, but there&rsquo;s a lot of political correctness in Canada I disagree with,&#8221; Mr. Wry said. &#8220;But personally, I think the best way to get past the stereotypes is to embrace our differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the college, a small crowd of about 10 activists had gathered to protest the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a difference between exercising freedom of speech and racism,&#8221; said Kate Milley, an activist with the first nations solidarity working group, who along with the Anti-racism Action group, organized the protest. &#8220;I have two issues here: One is with his message, and the other is that groups in Canada are sponsoring him to come and spread that message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farooq Khan, executive director of the North American Muslim Foundation, expressed shock at Mr. Wilders&rsquo; being allowed into the country, and is dismayed by what he sees as a lack of nuance in the views of many Westerners about Islam.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the political agenda of the far right, which is hell-bent on on creating an environment in which Muslims must get out of the West,&#8221; Mr. Khan said in an interview before Monday&rsquo;s speech. &#8220;The Wilders event is nothing more than creating hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Khan said it is because of events such as Monday&rsquo;s that Muslims in Canada feel marginalized, feelings he said lead young Muslims toward radicalization.</p>

<p>No kidding? And this is somehow controversial.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wilders is blind to the racial issue, making his political opinions a stopgap at best.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difference between exercising freedom of speech and racism,&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>1. That&rsquo;s a false dichotomy.<br>
2. What race is Islam?</p>

		<p>&#8220;His vitriol against the religion has necessitated the hiring of 24-hour personal security for the past seven years.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s funny, I thought the active murderous intent of thousands of Muslims around the world that was what necessitated the hiring of 24-hour personal security for the past seven years.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&rsquo;s a difference between exercising freedom of speech and racism,&rsquo; said Kate Milley.&#8221;  Ms. Milley, what race is Muslim?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is the political agenda of the far right, which is hell-bent on on creating an environment in which Muslims must get out of the West,&rsquo; Mr. Khan said in an interview before Monday&rsquo;s speech. &#8216;The Wilders event is nothing more than creating hatred.&rsquo; Mr. [Farooq] Khan said it is because of events such as Monday&rsquo;s that Muslims in Canada feel marginalized, feelings he said lead young Muslims toward radicalization.&#8221;  This must be the case, because the Sacred Qu&rsquo;ran does not read &#8220;Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain.&#8221; (9:111)  It must be feelings of marginalization that leads young Muslims toward radicalization, not the foundation document of Islam itself.</p>

		<p>What Wilders is doing is perfectly reasonable, even laudable in a world that most whites think we live in.  That is a democracy where swaying popular opinion results in how we are governed.</p>
<p>The reality is far, far different.  Every white country has a system by which decisions are made that is best described as totalitarian.  Complete imposition from without that is usually diametrically opposed to what &#8220;the people&#8221; want.  It&rsquo;s actually quite a bit worse than that.  Not content with simply getting its way, a significant amount of time, effort, energy and money is expended to brainwash &#8220;the people&#8221; into thinking that they don&rsquo;t actually support what they want but rather support what the government wants.</p>
<p>No matter how much people support Wilders, he will change nothing (at least not using those methods) and will probably spend the rest of his life in prison.  Intense propaganda will be created to make sure people view him as a villain.  A high price to pay for attempting to change things when you don&rsquo;t really know what is going on.</p>
<p>Wilders is important though.  As an example of what not to do.</p>

		<p>The 17 yr old was on to something, and then his brainwashed mind let him down.  &#8220;Embracing differences&#8221; is something only Westerners (whites) are told to do.  How many fundamentalist Muslims are told to &#8220;embrace&#8221; the differences they have with a 21st century Western culture?  How many would be okay with modifying their religious beliefs to accomdate those that thought differently?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Hatred&#8221;&hellip;&#8221;Racism.&#8221;<br>
I&rsquo;m beginning to be amused by the sound of those words. You know, the way you start to see a word as novel and simultaneously meaningless, the more you say or hear it? Over and over you hear it again, until it is utter gibberish.</p>
<p>Those words, along with &#8220;Diversity,&#8221; &#8220;Multiculturalism,&#8221; Tolerance,&#8221; etc., all have a very hollow, strange ring to me now. They are meaningless, and sound kind of funny.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but Islam isn&rsquo;t a religion, it&rsquo;s a total world domination ideology whose very name means submit or surrender. There has never been any way to separate mere religious worship of Allah from the political domination component, because the commands of Allah to Muslims to take over the world and rule in his name under His Way or Sharia are set in stone in the Quran.</p>
<p>From day one in the 7th cent. Islam declared war on the entire non-Muslim world, and launched a bloody jihad that took over a thousand years to stop, with the caliphate that has the power to declare jihad dismantled only in the 1920s. Just because there is no caliphate currently, that doesn&rsquo;t erase age-old battle lines or cause the Quran to become a museum piece, hence mass Muslim immigration to the West is tantamount to pulling the Trojan Horse into Ilium.</p>
<p>Only when the Muslim world goes further by dissolving itself as proved by dethroning Islam as the official religion, dismantling Sharia, and rejoining the human race by renouncing the Quran and its world domination goals and opening up to all religions will it be safe to permit immigration from the Muslim world. A decade of horrors caused by al-Qaeda et al. are just a taste if the Muslim pop. in Canada grows even to the 5%-10% level.</p>
<p>Canadian media like to jump on Wilders as a racist, but sorry,  PC thinking along the lines of racism or anti-Semitism won&rsquo;t work with Islam, because it wants to absorb all religions, and the Quran lumps Jews and Christians together as destined for Hell, and teaches Muslims to hate them and not make friends with them, but to subdue them and make them pay protection money (jizya) just to be allowed to live under Muslim rule.  As to atheists, they&rsquo;re considered pagans and not even allowed to pay jizya, but must convert or be killed, as they did with the Hindus, massacring millions to create the pro-state of Pakistan, which is now the most unstable state in the world.</p>
<p>True, a lot of modern Muslims don&rsquo;t read the Quran anymore or go to mosque, and have partly assimilated, but they give the Quran to their children to imbibe, continuing the cycle. Even a highly educated Muslim who takes to imbibing the Quran can go off like a ticking time bomb, for example Maj. Nidal Hasan. So, listen to Wilders if you value the peace and stability of Canada. There&rsquo;s 1.6 billion Muslims, and there&rsquo;s just no reason to start letting them in, else there might be no end as they throw the gates open to the entire Muslim world.</p>

<p>Typical liberal garbage. What differences would you like to embrace Mr. Wry? Pedophilia? Polygamy? Murder by chopping one&rsquo;s head off? There a lot more. Take your pick. </p>

		<p>After 9-11, I got a copy of the Koran and read much of it. The calls to violence are obvious. A fair retort would be that Christians have committed many atrocities  &mdash;  see &#8220;Inquisition&#8221;  &mdash;   as well. Unfortunately, the fair debate is whether MANY Muslims act on the writings in the Koran and whether many Christians act on the controversial &#8220;stuff&#8221; in the bible. The harsh reality is that for those not immune to evidence, there isn&rsquo;t really anything to debate. If we are open to evidence, given Mohammed&rsquo;s life, it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise that a significant minority of Muslims commit and support violence.  If this offends anyone, dial 1-FST-AMENDMT. </p>

		<p>Here are some thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  If you created a religion that dedicated itself to satanic worship, and then &#8216;1300 years later, cleaned up your act&rsquo;, you would still be taken to task for sharing the name of the prior cult whose philosophies were those of a epileptic sadist and serial killing pedophile.  Someone who lit fires on peoples chests to get their gold and then /killed them anyway/ to also have their wives.  Someone who, in a single day, beheaded some 600 defeated POWs, _on his own_.</p>
<p>2.  If the Muslims wish to show us that their&rsquo;s is &#8216;a religion of peace&rsquo;, they need to stop the collegiate tweed representation of themselves as upper class sophisticates on Nightline and the like and start making some rather harsh comments about the nature of _the majority Muslim on the street_ who do nothing but advocate the overthrow of the cultures in he/she are but a guest religion.  And yet go so far as to incite murder over the most trivial of things: cartoon artwork and **accurate** commentary about crime and welfare.</p>
<p>These elites who profess (falsely, using taqiya) to be representative of modern Islam won&rsquo;t take their own to task.  Because they can&rsquo;t, to do so would render them apostate and subject to death penalty murder in turn.</p>
<p>All this is proof that the nature of Islam _has not_, in fact, changed a single iota in all the centuries it has remained an artifact of historical revisionism.  That&rsquo;s right.  Nobody knows for sure what Mohammed intended &#8216;when he&rsquo;d won&rsquo; (overrunning the same are as Rome and Alexander combined).  Because he was an illiterate who wrote nothing down and the firt words of the Koran and Haditha are TWO CENTURIES post mortem from his death.</p>
<p>The one doctrine which is universally followed is that Dar Al Harb or &#8216;The House Of War&rsquo; will PERSIST until all other religions and peoples are &#8216;submit&rsquo; to Islam.</p>
<p>Not one single Islamic teacher or priest will dare argue against this because it is one of the tenets of a religion that sought to legitimize a Highwayman Culture of pure banditry.</p>
<p>As a religious crusade.</p>
<p>Oh my, the irony&hellip;</p>

		<p>Wilders is one of the few great men to come out of the &#8220;new Europe.&#8221;<br>
I can&rsquo;t imagine the Canadians accepting him, their anti-Western genocide is in full swing, Muslims are their new princes and princesses. </p>
