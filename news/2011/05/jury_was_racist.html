<h1>Jury Was Racist, Convicted HIV Killer Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Globe and Mail, May 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man convicted of killing two women by infecting them with HIV says he was only found guilty of first-degree murder because the jury was racist.</p>
<p>Johnson Aziga, 54-year-old Ugandan immigrant believed to be the first person in Canada convicted of murder through HIV transmission, is testifying at his dangerous offender hearing.</p>
<p>Mr. Aziga&rsquo;s convictions are related to 11 women with whom he had unprotected sex without telling them he had HIV and seven of the women became infected, with two dying of AIDS-related cancers.</p>
<p>On the stand today, Mr. Aziga said he admits he is guilty of aggravated sexual assault for not telling the women he was HIV positive before having unprotected sex with them.</p>
<p>But he says he shouldn&rsquo;t have been convicted of murder because while he exposed them to HIV, he doesn&rsquo;t believe he is definitely the source of their infections.</p>
<p>Mr. Aziga, who is black, says the jury found him guilty of the two murder counts because they were biased and racist.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see here:  Man has sex with women without telling them of his HIV status because he is afraid his infection with a potentially lethal disease precursor will keep him from having successful intercourse.</p>
<p>Ergo, he knows what a negative inducement to sex his HIV status is.  And is thus guilty as hell by account of his (lack of) forewarned actions.</p>
<p>That said, for whites at least, having sex with a sexually profligate black is itself a veritable BILLBOARD of bad outcomes for white women including the possible end of a beautiful genetic legacy so the reality must be:  The women who learn from this horrible lesson are better off than the ones who died.</p>
<p>If there is a finger to point, it must be leveled at the lack of screening for HIV immigrants (if you are going to let them off the boat to begin with&hellip;) as a precondition of citizenship or state benefits or whatever.</p>
<p>I have no problem with manditorily naming someone as an HIV carrier on dating sites and particularly as we become more &#8216;diverse&rsquo;, I see no other way to maintain any degree of safety in the face of such massive contagion risks from the 3rd world.</p>
<p>Oh, and I&rsquo;m just positive that Mr. Aziga is a doctorate level engineer with a side in brain surgery too.</p>

		<p>We have been told over and again that AIDS does not &#8220;discriminate&#8221;. Of course it does! It chooses those who involve themselves in risky behavior!</p>
<p><br>
Now we are told that we are racist if we convict a known AIDS carrier who infected some stupid women. What&rsquo;s next? </p>

<i>But he says he shouldn&rsquo;t have been convicted of murder because while he exposed them to HIV, he doesn&rsquo;t believe he is definitely the source of their infections.</i></p>
<p>Someone can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but I believe there are multiple strains of HIV.</p>
<p>They should be able to determine which stain Mr. Aziga has and if it matches that of his victims.</p>
<p>While again not 100% conclusive that the stain came from Mr. Aziga, it would narrow the source of infection. <br>

While the case of Johnson Aziga is the first HIV murder case, there are a number of related cases in Canada that had lesser punishments. Charles Ssenyonga, a Ugandan immigrant living in London, Ontario was the first person that was charged with failing to disclose his HIV status to a sexual partner, however he died before a verdict was rendered in his case.</i></p>

		<p>Does anyone in upstate New York remember the name NuShawn Williams?</p>
<p>Can you guess his color from his name?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a little refresher course and update:</p>
<p><i>Despite being told he was HIV positive, Williams stated that he believed health officials had lied to him when they informed him of his HIV status.</i></p>
<p><i>He was the primary cause of an HIV micro-epidemic in Chautauqua County. He infected at least 14 women in Chautauqua County with HIV, including numerous teenagers. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to two counts of statutory rape&hellip; and one count of reckless endangerment in the first degree for having unprotected sex with a woman who did not know his HIV status. He received a four-to-12-year sentence. Two of Williams&rsquo; children in Chautauqua County were also born with HIV, raising the number of known cases linked to Williams to 16.</i></p>
<p><i>In April 2010, New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo moved to block Williams&rsquo; release from prison after 12 years&hellip; A judge ordered him remanded to custody pending an outcome of a civil proceeding.</i></p>
<p>And, because he is black, the msm HAD to toss this in:</p>
<p><i>Authorities have determined that Williams suffers from a mental-health abnormality that makes him incapable of understanding why his actions are wrong or harmful.</i></p>

<p>Thanks for reminding us of the NuShawn Williams case.  Most of his victims were white drug addicted runaways with highly promiscuous lifestyles, but the MSM tried to imply that they were all suburban princess honor students.  It was one of the MSM&rsquo;s most infamous attempts to show that &#8220;AIDS happens to everyone regardless of life choices!&#8221;.  Never mind that they all acted like unpaid hookers&hellip;  </p>
<p><i>And, because he is black, the msm HAD to toss this in: &#8220;Authorities have determined that Williams suffers from a mental-health abnormality that makes him incapable of understanding why his actions are wrong or harmful.&#8221;</i>  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply lack of conscience/empathy, combined with greed and low IQ.  &#8220;Feel like doing it?  Then it must be right!&#8221;  It&rsquo;s stunningly common among blacks, but you&rsquo;ll never see the MSM mention that.  <br>

<p>What&rsquo;s even more infuriating is that the schools tried to push this scare-tactic line as well:  ALL of us are at <i>extreme</i> risk of contracting AIDS!!  I have entire textbooks that are dedicated to AIDS education   &mdash;   at the expense of much more pervasive and common STIs that are <i>rampant</i> in (especially) non-White communities, STIs such as HPV, HSV, chlamydia  and gonorrhea.</p>
<p>When I speak to my students about these much more common STIs, they look at me as if I&rsquo;m Mars, they are completely clueless   &mdash;   but they CAN rattle off methods of AIDS transmission from having it pounded into their little brains for years and years! </p>
<p>AIDS became a hot political issue because of its association with gays, especially after ACT-UP commandeered and then controlled the entire public debate.</p>
<p>David Horowitz writes:</p>
<p><i>The march of death is made possible by the surrender of public health authorities to the pressures of political groups opposed to what once had been the standard procedure for fighting epidemic diseases like AIDS: testing. Without testing of at-risk individuals and groups, there is no way to insure that individuals will know their lives are in danger, or that they are endangering the lives of others. Yet irresponsible zealots have successfully removed mandatory testing from the government&rsquo;s arsenal of weapons available in the battle against AIDS.</i></p>

		<p>Quite frankly, it makes me wonder why the AIDS epidemic wasn&rsquo;t handled with the seriousness of, say, hoof and mouth disease or bird flu.</p>
<p>I lived in an area where deer were regionally genocided because of fear of prion disease.</p>
<p>But humans?  Meh, our diseases are just playtime, I guess, the way people are allowed to travel and spread whatever they wish wherever they like.  They wouldn&rsquo;t even shut Pearson Airport to Asian flights during the SARS crisis.  Yep, just let those Asians from the originating hot zone keep coming all they want!  The recent MEXICAN flu they pinned on pigs?  Some pig farm worker came back here from Mexico, went back to work, and wiped out a whole herd of porkers with HIS disease.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, humans are the cleanest things on the planet, and no one could DREAM of even quarantining any more, that&rsquo;s barbaric, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Boy, will humanity be in for one rude shock when Captain Trips really does finally show his ugly head, eh?</p>

<p>The USG has been working on and spent untold billions on a &#8220;promising&#8221; AIDS vaccine since the 80s.</p>
<p><i>Since 1987, more than 30 vaccine candidates have been tested.</i></p>
<p>None have been successful for a variety of reasons, including that HIV is highly mutable.</p>
<p>What I am more concerned with is the vastly disproportionate amount of taxpayer monies directed toward AIDS research at the expense of more common diseases that affect vastly more people.</p>
<p>According to the National Vital Statistics Report, March 2011, the leading cause of death in the US is:  <i>Diseases of the Heart</i>; COPD is listed at #3.  AIDS is not listed in the top 15 leading causes of death.  </p>
<p>See here for list:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/629epwk" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/629epwk</a></p>
<p>According to FAIR, Fair Allocations in Research:</p>
<p><b>AIDS</b>:  Projected for 2012 allocated NIH Research Funds:  3.2 Billion<br>
           $$/ Patient Death:  $310, 830<br>
           $$/Patient:  $3,047</p>
<p><b>Cardiovascular Disease</b>:  Projected for 2012 allocated NIH Research Funds:  2.2 Billion.<br>
           $$/Patient Death:  $2,831<br>
            $$/ Patient:  $27</p>
<p><b>COPD</b>:  Projected for 2012 allocated NIH Research Funds:  120 million<br>
                            $$/Patient Death:  $851<br>
                             $$/Patient:  $8</p>
<p>Chart here:  http://tinyurl.com/6l5ehr</p>
<p>NIH Research Chart by Death:  http://goo.gl/3ato7</p>
<p><i>Obama requested $32.1 billion for the NIH in 2011, calling for the agency to &#8216;Initiate 30 new drug trials in 2011, and double the number of novel compounds in Phase 1 - 3 clinical trials by 2016.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>How much of the $32.1 billion, funded by American taxpayers,  will be dedicated to more AIDS-related research at the expense of other, more common diseases?</p>
<p>We American taxpayers would like to know.</p>
