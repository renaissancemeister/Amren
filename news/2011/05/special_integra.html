<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At Harambee Elementary in Maplewood, cultural diversity soaks into almost every lesson, activity and classroom discussion.</p>
<p>A &#8220;community cultures specialist&#8221; tours classes to make sure students are working across racial lines and learning about multiple world view perspectives. Kindergartners use crayons in numerous shades of skintone to draw accurate pictures of themselves. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t shy away from having conversations about race and the way we treat each other,&#8221; said Harambee Principal Kristine Black.</p>
<p>But Harambee and the metro area&rsquo;s other voluntary integration programs are under intensifying pressure to show more than racial harmony among their 13,000 students. At a time when student achievement is a top priority, two out of the metro area&rsquo;s three integration districts have failed to make the academic progress required under federal law. Some districts have pulled out.</p>
<p>Their future darkened even more Wednesday when the Legislature passed a K-12 appropriation that sliced more than a third of the funding for the integration districts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black hopes that won&rsquo;t happen. &#8220;To just eliminate the funding feels shortsighted,&#8221; said Black. &#8220;This is long-term work that we&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s a really complex problem and it&rsquo;s going to need comprehensive solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>13,000 students, $25 million</b></p>
<p>Minnesota&rsquo;s special integration schools were born in 1997, after the state overhauled its desegregation program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2001, the Northwest Suburban Integration School District formed when Brooklyn Center joined St. Paul and Minneapolis as a &#8220;racially isolated&#8221; district. It has worked with existing schools rather than building new ones.</p>
<p>The integration districts spent around $25.2 million last year. Most came from its member districts&rsquo; integration revenue, education tax dollars that follow students, and state and federal grants. The money pays for academic programs, cultural-awareness training for teachers, social services and transportation.</p>
<p>The three districts have shown success in getting families to participate. Of the districts&rsquo; approximately 13,000 students, about half are white, and about half are low-income.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A look at the scores</b></p>
<p>But strong academic results have been more difficult to show.</p>
<p>For example, fewer students at Harambee were proficient in reading and math last year than at Cowern Elementary, a North St. Paul neighborhood school with similar demographics that did make academic progress under federal law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Star Tribune analysis of state test score data shows that minority students from Minneapolis and St. Paul clearly score better in the special integration schools than do the minority students in their home districts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-four percent of minority students at EMID were proficient in reading, more than the nearly 43 percent in St. Paul. For WMEP, almost 66 percent of minority students were proficient in reading, compared with 36 percent in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The achievement gap between white and minority students persisted, but narrowed in the integration schools. There remains a 38 percent difference between white and black students proficient in reading in St. Paul, compared to a 20 percent difference at EMID. Minneapolis showed a 50 percent difference between students of color and white students&rsquo; proficiency rate while WMEP only has a 23 percent difference.</p>
<p>But the picture changes when east suburban districts are compared to EMID&rsquo;s integration schools. There the integration schools&rsquo; minority students rated below those in the regular school districts in both reading and math proficiency.</p>
<p><b>Achievement now a goal</b></p>
<p>Student achievement wasn&rsquo;t an explicit goal of the integration schools in the beginning, school officials say. That didn&rsquo;t happen until 2008, three years after the Legislative Auditor reported that integration aid lacked a clear goal, and that neither the state nor schools adequately assess its results.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Northwest Suburban Integration School District executive director Mark Robertson said schools need time and, possibly, more money to address that, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robertson said his integration district likely would fold if Gov. Mark Dayton approves the funding cuts. Most of the school districts would discontinue most of the programs jumpstarted by the Northwest Integration District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Integration schools are &#8220;not immune to improvement,&#8221; said Jerry Robicheau, EMID&rsquo;s interim superintendent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the challenge is how do you truly integrate?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just having students sit in classroom that&rsquo;s multicultural is one thing but how do you really create an inclusive environment that deals with all students?&#8221;</p>

		<p>White parents would have to be absolute morons to send their kids to a school like this. On the bright side the kids will probably be race realists by the time they hit 3rd grade! I would seriously wonder about &#8220;teacher assistance&#8221; if there was a huge increase in test scores from one year to the next. It is pretty obvious when the &#8220;integration&#8221; experiment started the influx of white students increased the test scores- at least in this case!</p>

		<p>These marxists are completely out of control.  Kindergartners don&rsquo;t care about nor understand cultural differences or &#8220;multiple world view perspectives&#8221;, they don&rsquo;t care about race either.  They care about playtime and cartoons.  They care about learning the alphabet and phonics.  These schools don&rsquo;t care about actually teaching kids, just their own insane ideology. </p>
<p>It seems these certifiably insane administrators will not rest until they bring everyone, regardless of race, right to the bottom.  I can hear them triumphantly stating that &#8220;all are equal now&#8221; over and over again.  </p>

		<p>I think Teddy may have accidently anticipated the plague of &#8220;diversity&#8221; that has descended on this country by nearly a hundred years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americans&hellip; The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of it continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities.&#8221; </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s what happens when you send your children to public schools   &mdash;   they become experimental subjects for left wing mad scientists.  When one insists upon dragging diversity into every subject is it surprising that math scores suffer?  After all, nearly all the math you learn up to your senior year in college was discovered by white men.  If you go on to graduate school you will learn math discovered by Asians as well, but theorems proved by blacks or Mestizos will still be nearly nonexistent.<br>

		<p>Of course integration &#8220;seems&#8221; to work among kindergartners.  Five-year olds aren&rsquo;t very race conscious.  That and there are very little in the way of hard academics in KG.   Even in the antebellum South, whites allowed their children to play with black children, until they got to be a certain age.</p>

		<p>Minnesota Minority Education Partnership, Inc. informs us that Minnesota is one of the few states that have ever tried a program such as Special Integrated School Districts. As such, now that the program has been proven a failure, Minnesota Minority Education Partnership, Inc. is threatening to sue the people of Minnesota if they cut the funding.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Student achievement wasn&rsquo;t an explicit goal of integration schools in the beginning&#8221; school officials say. Brilliant!   And they referred to minority students ( revealingly ) as &#8220;low income&#8221;, indicating the reflex, the presumption, that readers would know its intended meaning.                    Why not spend one trillion($) on each district,seeing as though funds are lavished on similarly quixotic goals these days, without a thought of the unintended consequences.And when a hint of progress shows, (no matter how small or dubious those gains are) a mist amongst countless fraudulent expenditures, it serves as the excuse to open new hopeful voyages (more funds) to other, more extreme moral ( or immoral ) crusades&hellip;. with achievements in math and reading being secondary, of coarse.           Everything we do should be viewed in terms of cost/benefit analysis.No one doubts that spending 25 million dollars on a school district is bound to show AT LEAST some kind of increase in test scores, or whatever benchmark for assessment they use (OK, maybe we doubt it a little). But they had better show improvements, wondrous improvements! This should be no surprise, nor an encouragement. </p>

<p>Reading a sentence like this gives me the creeps!  Even behind the Iron Curtain, they didn&rsquo;t have brainwashing like this. Our schools have degenerated into mere indoctrination centers.<br>
And the schools are in the hands of race-obsessed maniacs.</p>
<p><br>
I checked the population statistics of Maplewood, Minnesota.<br>
I see it is 89% white, 3.5% Afro.<br>
Why should Maplewood&rsquo;s mostly white students be subjected to those race-leveling integrationist fanatics?</p>

		<p>The caption on the picture says, &#8220;Kindergartners forced to learn multiple world view perspectives.&rdquo; Great.  The only kids in the picture capable of typical elementry school learning are being denied their ABC&rsquo;s and 1-2-3&rsquo;s so we can indoctrinate them with &ldquo;multiple world view perspectives.&rdquo; By the time they get to fourth grade and take standardized tests &#8220;experts&#8221; wonder why they are struggling with reading and math.  Meanwhile, white children are being denied traditional stories and lessons about THEIR culture.  They are told earlier and earlier their heritage is evil.  In Minnesota they must learn about the brilliant, beautiful, and bright Hmong and Somali cultures first.  </p>

<p>When I was a boy (early 80&rsquo;s) my Mother would take us from western WI to the Maplewood Mall to school shop.  It was nothing for her to leave my brother and I alone at ages 8 and 11 for hours at a time to explore.  If a parent did that now they would be locked up for child endangerment.  There is one thing and one thing only that caused this.  Diversity.</p>

		<p>This madness can be very exhausting.  My children are 10 and 14 and go to an excellent public school system which is nearly all  white.  Still the school is always teaching a lot of multicultural diversity appreciation, cultural enrichment, blame whitey, etc.  I have had to deprogram them every day since they were little and now that they are getting older, I find I have a lot more work to do as regards the deprogramming because their questions are more sophisticated.  Because of the way children think, it&rsquo;s not always easy to do without fear of crossing the line (in their heads) from white racial consciousness and pride to white supremacy and &#8220;hatemongering&#8221;.  My husband and I are both the children of Irish immigrants, and in some sense I think it makes it a bit easier for us because the Irish are well-known for cultural interest in music and other Irish activities.  For example, my daughter plays several instruments in Irish music and she dances Irish dance.  We have a local Irish community center where these things and other community activities go on. On the next street is an Italian center.  The day someone says this type of thing is racist will probably wake white people up (I have been saying that for a long time though and still whites have not woken up).  I wonder if it is the same for other whites of, for instance, German descent?  They have a Steuben Day parade and certainly when I was growing up some of my classmates had to go to German school on Saturday mornings.  But it seems to be unacceptable when we unite as whites and not as individual European peoples.  I pray every night that white people will stop this nonsense which is clearly going to be the ruin of us.  It needs to stop.  Where will it end?</p>

		<p>Kindergarteners see and understand racial differences on a very real but also very, very simplistic level. Personally, I&rsquo;ve found that the best approach is to answer their questions simply and without any political indoctrination - let them take their time to develop their own understanding.</p>
<p>I believe in this approach - answering questions but leaving them alone for the most part - because kids at that age are extremely susceptible to adult influence. It&rsquo;s frighteningly easy for an adult to turn 5 and 6 years old into perfect little obedient soldiers for practically any political viewpoint you want them to accept. Anyone with kids knows that with not much effort they will soon parrot back anything you want.</p>
<p>Which is why this classroom political indoctrination is so infuriating. They are messing with the heads of little kids in the most manipulative ways. I&rsquo;m sad to say I&rsquo;ve seen it with kids I know. For example, after the annual public school MLK indoctrination sessions, I&rsquo;ve had 5 yr old kids ask me &#8220;why black people have to sit in the back of the bus?&#8221; I&rsquo;ve had to spend more time correcting the information they&rsquo;ve been given and dispelling the myths they&rsquo;ve been fed than the amount of time it took for some idiot teacher to plant the misinformation in the first place.</p>
<p>In short, 5 year old kids should not be guinea pigs for cultural/social engineering schemes and half-baked indoctrination regimens. It&rsquo;s truly infuriating that this is happening.</p>
<p>I would also add that while I don&rsquo;t believe in going overboard the other direction with indoctrinating little kids, I do think it is important to be proactive and to instill a positive sense of racial identity in them. Acknowledging they&rsquo;re white (and that it&rsquo;s a good thing), telling them stories about where their ancestors came from (England, Germany, Scandanavia, etc) and keeping family traditions alive.</p>

		<p>87.64% of people are white and only a tiny 4.11% are black, in Maplewood. Whoops&hellip;..I notice those facts were left out of the article.</p>
<p>The article lists $25 million for 30,000 children. But at 4%, we are talking about only 1200 black children.  And an amazing $20k a year per child.  That is what my local school budget pays for eduction.  About $20k per student per year.</p>
<p>What these people are doing is essentially spending double on black children than they do on white children and making claims that have nothing to so with the black children, since they are diluted into a sea of well behaving, studies whites.  And I bet, were someone able to get a hold of the records they would STILL find something like 90% of the discipline problems and special ed needs were from the ultra small black minority.</p>

		<p><i>Student achievement wasn&rsquo;t an explicit goal of the integration schools in the beginning, school officials say.</i></p>
<p>This is a powerful admission, even though it&rsquo;s only in the context of one &#8220;integration&#8221; program in one suburban school district in one city.  &#8220;Student achievement&#8221; was supposed to be THE reason for all desegregation and forced integration programs.  When black achievement nor the narrowing of the race gap happens, then deseg advocates slip up and tell you the truth, that forced integration was both the means and the end all along, with the ultimate aim being deconstruction of white civilization.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right. These naive liberal fools are signing their own death warrants.<br>
Once Islam takes over, the feminists, abortionists, homosexuals and diversitoids will be the first to go.</p>

<p>In 1965 Hubert Humphrey (another Minnesotan) swore that he would eat his hat if the pending Civil Rights Act ever resulted in forced busing for school integration. Somewhere in hell, Humphrey is being forced to devour hats 24/7.</p>

		<p>This whole approach is so Soviet as to be terrifying.</p>
<p>If diversity is so great, why isn&rsquo;t it naturally having dividends?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re forcing a square peg into a round hole.</p>
<p>If we applied the same standards of criticism that we apply to anti-drug education, abstinence-only sex education or even phonetic spelling to diversity education, we&rsquo;d wonder why the program even existed.</p>
<p>Yet it appears to be gaining steam, as if we think this is our next big industry. Agriculture, automobiles, computers, diversity. Sure thing.</p>

<p>For German Americans, our past has been heavily diluted. We don&rsquo;t speak German unless we choose to study it in college. (I did.) All German-American clubs display the current German flag, which is meaningless and has nothing to do with our ancestors. Many of us are race realist, but our &#8220;spokespeople&#8221; are overly PC and liberal to desperately avoid references to nazism. They religiously praise diversity and speak nostalgically about grandma&rsquo;s apple strudel. </p>
<p>My opinions are more realistic. Our former neighborhoods in big cities have been destroyed by minorities. German-Americans, like all other white Americans, have been heavily victimized by interracial violent crime. At least in the U.S., sometimes the criminals are actually punished. Blacks and Muslims can rape and murder at will in the real Germany. There are virtually no punishments for interracial violent crime there, if the victim is a white German. </p>
<p>I also feel completely alienated from modern Germany.  As a younger person, I visited Germany to see German culture. Of course, I was met with a sea of Islam. We all know that&hellip;but even the real Germans were not German.  The youth culture was especially disturbing. They seemed to worship a mantra of black American gangsta rap. All of their entertainment venues were black gangsta rappers. I can understand that young people wouldn&rsquo;t be into folk music, but why not German rock bands, etc? They would reply, &#8220;oh that is so boring, we love everything American!&#8221;.  I would reply  that American is fine, but why do they love black prison culture, something that only wants to rape and murder whites?  Some listened politely, and of course some shouted me down for being racist. Older German men seemed to be obsesseed with sex tourism and &#8220;poofs&#8221; (brothels). In a socialist, atheist country, I guess anything goes. Older German ladies seemed to have the most sense there. They were typically more traditional and realistic. They seemed to have some morals and values, and lament about the good things from the past (not nazis). The older women were even somewhat religious. </p>
<p>My complaint about Germany is that it is not German anymore. I even hear that complaint from non-white friends who travel there. Even they want to see real Germans&hellip;but Germany is gone. Here in America, we struggle to keep what is left. I never had kids, but if I did, I would be desperately trying to warn them about &#8220;urban culture&#8221;, and trying to prevent my daughters from dating violent thugs. Unless we have a serious, powerful, political renessaince, we are all doomed.<br>

		<p>I posted #29. I apologize for the tangent, but it was a response to an Irish American lady, Deirdre, who asked about the situation with German Americans. </p>
<p>Back to the subject&hellip;When we lived in the cities, neither parents nor students wanted their children to be schooled with blacks. There was some rivalry between European  groups, but nothing major.  When the blacks moved into the Northern cities, the European immigrants reacted by sending their children to Catholic schools, or similar. When our neighborhoods became unbearable to live in, we moved to the suburbs. Our public schools and neighborhoods were safe, for awhile. With the advent of forced busing and Section 8 housing, it was back to Catholic schools. I remember, during forced busing, an elderly white teacher in our area was actually raped by one of her new black high school students&hellip;so much for the diversity experiment. (It never made the news)</p>
<p>Some of us could afford private schools, but the overly liberal private schools began busing in &#8220;urban youths&#8221; for charity purposes. I went to a private school, this was the case. We had as many &#8220;urban youths&#8221; as the local public school. Some of our radical, left wing teachers patted themselves on the back, but more than half of the school was outraged. Also, our lecturers&rsquo; topics at chapel would range from communist propaganda to sexual fetishes (no joke). Well, back to the Catholic schools. </p>
<p>These days, my niece is sent to a mostly white parochial school.  The school is in a mostly white community and tries hard to maintain a safe environment for its mostly white student body. They desperately try to avoid controversy or scandal.  The school, like all parochial and private schools is incredibly expensive. In the past such schools were more affordable&hellip;but now there are so many parents trying quietly to save their children from diversity, the price of education has skyrocketed.  </p>
<p>My conclusion is, instead of running and hiding, spending your life savings to save your children from black thugs, actually stand up for your rights and take your schools and neighborhoods back. The Jews in Israel fought for their right to exist against far more odds. We can do the same. (Even if you disagree with Israel, we as whites can follow that example). I also must reference the recent Arab uprisings against their tyrannical dictators. Like these desperate people, we can be successful in rebelling against our own genocide. It is our duty as Americans and as human beings. We can successfully do what others tell us is impossible.</p>

		<p>   The situation in these multicultural schools mirrors the life views of the administrators, for whom apparently the vocation of &#8220;diversicrat&#8221; has paid off handsomely. Unfortunately, the world beyond the schoolroom doesn&rsquo;t have tens of thousands of jobs for certified multicultural experts.The hard business of earning a living is not understood by the padded payrolls of government employees. Since, however, ultimately all government revenues depends on coercion ( overt or covert)for funding, the day will certainly come when the socialist agenda hits the very hard wall of financial reality. <br>
   It is almost comical how unaware our &#8220;educators&#8221; are of the world they think they know so well. Check the recent electoral results in Spain, for instance. Conservative right down the line; Socialists out for the simple reason that the country cannot afford their fantasies any longer.<br>
   Not comic but certainly ironic is the dismal educational performance of these schools. However, as I have said before, the social climate is changing to one of ethnocentricity. This is because the East Asian power class is growing in influence. The people who make policy in China, Japan, and elsewhere are unapologetic about their ethnocentric style. As Charlie Sheen sort of said, it is all about &#8220;winning&#8221;. The decline in liberally ruled and multicultural societies is plain for anyone to see. Politicians who want to win will sooner or later have to adapt to the reality of decline be they liberals, or resurgence if they are not. <br>
  Perhaps white America can regain its pride and momentum but it will have to do so against a backdrop of hoots and catcalls. No one wants, according to the MSM, white America anymore. Strange though how the blessings of white America is what everyone wants, secretly.</p>
