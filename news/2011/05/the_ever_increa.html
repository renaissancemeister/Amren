			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Living in a Madhouse, April 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the past two days there have been a series of stories which demonstrate both the grip on British society established by the ideology which is political correctness and the power of such totalitarian creeds to drive its disciples to ever more absurd behaviour  &mdash;  totalitarian because the politically correct hold that theirs is the only permissible view to hold and because the creed intrudes into every aspect of life because of the central role played in it by discrimination, there being nothing which cannot be potentially described in terms of unequal treatment.</p>
<p>The stories range from the sinister to the risible. The most sinister was the case of a part-time musician Simon Ledger who was arrested by the police after he played Carl Douglas&rsquo;s 1974 number one hit Kung Fu Fighter as a Chinese man happened to walk by his performance on the seafront at Sandown in the Isle of White. (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8475965/Pub-singers-racism-arrest-over-Kung-Fu-Fighting-performance.html). The Chinese man made a complaint to the police of racial harassment (the simple playing of the song was the basis of the alleged racial harassment as it &#8220;stereotyped &#8221; the Chinese man) and they immediately treated this as a matter of great urgency. Ledger was arrested, had his photo, DNA and fingerprints taken before being bailed. The next day he was questioned by and gave a statement to the police, a process which took 90 minutes. The police decided no offence had been committed, but Ledger had suffered the upset of being accused of a crime treated as the most toxic by the British elite and his photo, DNA and fingerprints remain on the police national database in perpetuity. The logic of the arrest on such absurd grounds is that no musician performing in public can be certain they will not be arrested through unwittingly playing a tune or song which someone will consider racially demeaning.</p>
<p>The second story involved a black headmistress Shirley Patterson. Patterson headed a school in Southwark, South London. Hers is a truly bizarre complaint. A school-governor David Moyle put a poster advertising a parent-teacher evening which used a photograph of plastic human figures consisting of Charles Darwin in the centre surrounded other white figures waving objects such as staves and pitchforks at Darwin. Patterson &#8220;called the police to allege harassment, saying she believed the figure was meant to depict her surrounded by a mob of white parents. Governor David Moyle said his poster advertising a parents&rsquo; meeting was a joke about pushy parents demanding higher standards  &mdash;  and police decided no crime had been committed.&#8221; (https://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23944678-we-were-right-to-suspend-school-governor-in-race-row-over-poster.do). This was not the end of the matter because Southwark council set up their own investigation and suspended Moyle.</p>
<p>Down in Pitcombe in Somerset the police were on the trail of another dangerous criminal. His crime? Someone had put up picture which made Conservative councillor Mike Beech look like Hitler. In pursuit of this dangerous felon the police conducted door-to-door searches on the twenty odd houses in the hamlet. (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8475561/Police-hunt-joker-who-drew-Hitler-moustache.html).</p>
<p>Down in the House of Commons alleged male chauvinism stirred. During Prime Minister&rsquo;s Questions PM David Cameron advised Angela Eagle, a shadow Treasury minister, to &#8220;Calm down dear&#8221; as Ms Eagle, who is a feminist made in the Andrea Dworkin mould, rowdily barracked Cameron from the opposition front bench. Cue for the Labour Party to engage in an orgy of PC posturing and the media to make it the lead story in news bulletins for a day. (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/8476624/Calm-down-dear-David-Camerons-sexist-taunt-to-Labour-MP.html).</p>
<p>The final story carried absurdity the furthest.  The Journal of Animal Ethics railed against such enormities as the use of pet to describe, well, pets and wildlife to describe er wildlife.  The editor of  the journal Revd Professor Andrew Linzey, a theologian and director of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, wants everyone to refer to pets as companion animals,  owners as carers  and wildlife as &#8216;free-living&rsquo;, &#8216;free-ranging&rsquo; or &#8216;free-roaming&rsquo;. Not content with this, the Journal urges the ending of phrases such as  &#8216;&#8220;sly as a fox, &#8220;eat like a pig&#8221; or &#8220;drunk as a skunk&#8221;&rsquo; because they are &rsquo; all unfair to animals&rsquo;. (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8479391/Calling-animals-pets-is-insulting-academics-claim).</p>
<p>That is just a couple of days&rsquo; of this particular form of ideological madness. A situation has been created in Britain today akin to that of Stalin&rsquo;s Russia. It is no longer possible to remain safe by subscribing to the tenets of the ruling ideology because the ideology keeps changing its shape and increasing its range. Even the most dedicated and enthusiastic follower of political correctness can find themselves in the coils of heresy simply because they have either not known that a new ideological rule has been introduced or because they have not anticipated a circumstance in which a hitherto unknown identified breach of the creed is unearthed.</p>
<p>The effect political correctness on individual lives can be profound. Jobs can be lost on a whim and criminal investigations started at the drop of a hat,. The police have been turned into political commissars in the service of political correctness. The idea that a man can be arrested simply for performing a song and have his photo, fingerprints and DNA put permanently on a police database is positively sinister.</p>
<p>There is also another sinister aspect to this type of crime. The police do not routinely investigate crimes  &mdash;  try getting them to investigate a burglary. In the case of incitement to racial hatred cases they operate a double standard: if the complainant is from an ethnic minority they investigate; if the complainant is white they refuse not only to investigate but to record the complaint. I have direct experience of this involving the Metropolitan police. Let me illustrate their unwillingness to act with correspondence between Sir John Stevens (then Metropolitan Police Commissioner), Gerald Howarth MP and myself after I made a complaint of racial incitement by the then BBC Director-General Greg Dyke after he referred to the BBC as &#8220;hideously white.&#8221; It shows clearly how determined the police are not to investigate complaints of racial incitement when it involves someone considered to be part of the politically correct elite and the complaint is made by someone white concerning abuse of that racial group. The complete correspondence in date order appears below.<br>

						<p>18 January 2001<br>Asst Dept. Comm. John Grieve<br>Racial and Violent Crimes Squad<br>Metropolitan Police<br>New Scotland Yard<br>10 The Broadway<br>London SWlH 6BG<br>cc All national newspapers<br>Gerald Howorth MP</p>
<p>Dear Mr Grieve,</p>
<p>I ask you to take investigate the statement by the BBC Director General, Greg Dyke, that the BBC is &#8220;hideously white&#8221; for inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>The statement is unambiguously racist because Mr Dyke is making a statement about a recognised racial group and the use of the word &#8220;hideously&#8221; is highly inflammatory. The extremely unpleasant nature of it can be seen by substituting black or Asian for white: &#8220;hideously black&#8221;, &#8220;hideously Asian&#8221;. Its effect can only be to incite racial hatred against whites.</p>
<p>The severity of the offence is greatly magnified by Mr Dyke&rsquo;s position as the head of our state funded broadcaster. I enclose a cutting from the Sunday Telegraph dated 7/1/2001, to formally substantiate the statement Mr Dyke made.</p>
<p>I am sure that the severity of the offence and Mr Dyke&rsquo;s position will lead a fervent anti-racist such as yourself to take immediate and exemplary action.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Robert Henderson</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>John G D Grieve CBE QPM BA (Hons) M.Phil<br>Deputy Assistant Commissioner<br>Director, Racial &amp; Violent Crime Task Force<br>Room 936 New Scotland Yard<br>Broadway LONDON<br>SWIH 0BG<br>Telephone: 0171-230-4186<br>Facsimile: 0171-230-2152<br>E-Mail: athena.met police@gtnet.gov, uk<br>Date: 31 January 2001</p>
<p>Dear Mr Henderson</p>
<p>I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 18th January, 2001 concerning remarks made by Mr Greg Dyke, the Director General of the BBC.</p>
<p>When the Racial and Violent Crime Task Force was established in 1998 it was given clear terms of reference, which included that it would only be tasked at the direct request of an Assistant Commissioner from within this Service. In acknowledgement of the concerns expressed about race crime and to endorse divisions as the focal point of police-public interference we established Community Safety Units in every London Borough.</p>
<p>I have not seen or heard the comments you refer to but if you feel that they may constitute a criminal offence you can report the matter to your local police for possible investigation.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Detective Inspector Howard Gosling<br>Staff Officer to John G D Grieve Deputy Assistant Commissioner</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>12 February 2001<br>Mr John Stevens<br>Metropolitan Police Commissioner<br>New Scotland Yard<br>10 The Broadway<br>London SWlH 6BG<br>cc All national newspapers<br>Gerald Howorth MP</p>
<p>Dear Mr Stevens,</p>
<p>I enclose a copy of a letter I sent to John Grieve making a formal complaint against the BBC Director-General, Greg Dyke, for his remarks about the BBC being &#8220;hideously white&#8221;.</p>
<p>A DI Gosling has replied on behalf of Mr Grieve. A copy of his letter is enclosed. It is the type of letter which brings the public service into contempt.</p>
<p>DI Gosling makes himself ridiculous when he says &#8220;I have not seen or heard the comments you refer to&hellip;&#8221; Not only would he have had to be living in a cave for the past few months not to have met them through the general media coverage, I sent a newspaper cutting giving the story and offending words with my original letter of complaint to John Grieve.</p>
<p>DI Gosling is begging the question when he says that an Asst Commissioner must &#8220;task&#8221; Grieve&rsquo;s group before action can be taken. The proper procedure when a complaint is made to John Grieve is for it to be submitted to an Asst Commissioner. If it was rejected as inappropriate for action by the RVCTF, it should have been submitted to my nearest police station in accordance with standard police practice. However, this is manifestly a complaint which is suitable for John Grieve, because it involves a public figure with great practical influence and the words used were highly inflammatory.</p>
<p>I ask you to take up the complaint and instruct John Grieve to investigate it forthwith.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Robert Henderson</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>6 March 2001<br>Mr John Stevens<br>Metropolitan Police Commissioner<br>New Scotland Yard<br>10 The Broadway<br>London SWlH 6BG<br>cc All national newspapers<br>Gerald Howorth MP</p>
<p>Dear Mr Stevens,</p>
<p>I wrote to you on 12 February concerning an absurd reply I had received from the Racial and Violent Crimes Squad following a complaint I had made about Greg Dyke, the Director General of the BBC (copy enclosed). I have had no answer from you. My original letter was sent, as is this, by recorded delivery, so please do not waste your time and mine claiming it was not received.</p>
<p>If you refuse to address this complaint honestly, it will be unambiguous proof that your police force is not interested in applying the law equally. Dyke&rsquo;s comments were unambiguously racist and his position in charge of the only state broadcaster amplified them greatly.</p>
<p>I suggest you reply by return of post.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Robert Henderson</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>10-March 2001<br>Mr John Stevens<br>Metropolitan Police Commissioner<br>New Scotland Yard<br>10 The Broadway<br>London SWlH 6BG<br>cc All national newspapers<br>Gerald Howorth MP</p>
<p>Dear Mr Stevens,</p>
<p>I have Mr Grieve&rsquo;s letter of 2 March in response to my letter to you of 12 February. A bald refusal to act will not do.</p>
<p>Anne Robinson, a presenter, makes some obviously tongue-in-cheek remarks about the Welsh on a comedy programme: result  &mdash;  the matter is referred to the police who take it seriously and begin preparing a file for the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
<p>Greg Dyke, the Director-General of the state broadcasting service, the BBC, states that his senior management team is &#8220;hideously white&#8221;. Mr Dyke is (1) the most powerful man in British broadcasting and (2) the remark is unambiguously racist in the crudest fashion and feeds the resentments of the minorities in Britain. Yet you refuse to act. Why?</p>
<p>I repeat what I said in my letter of 6 March, every time you refuse to apply the law even-handedly, a nail is knocked in the coffin of your credibility and that of your force.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Robert Henderson</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>

<p>Dear Mr Grieve,</p>
<p>Mr Robert Henderson of 156 Levita House, Chalton Street, London NWl 1HR, wrote to the commissioner about Mr Greg Dyke&rsquo;s remarks about theBBC being &#8216;hideously white&rsquo;. I do think the police owe us all an explanation as to why those remarks -quite clearly racial  &mdash;  warrant no reaction from yourselves whilst the remarks of Ann Robinson about the Welsh do.</p>
<p>What is the difference?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>2 April 2001<br>Sir John Stevens<br>Metropolitan Police Commissioner<br>New Scotland Yard<br>10 The Broadway<br>London SWlH 6BG<br>cc All national newspapers<br>Gerald Howorth MP</p>
<p>Dear Sir John,</p>
<p>My apologies for missing your &#8216;K&rsquo; in previous letters. I have had no reply to my letter (sent by recorded delivery) of 10 March. A copy is attached. Are you refusing to give your reasons for failing to act against Greg Dyke for his &#8220;hideously white&#8221; comment?</p>
<p>I would also like answers to these questions:</p>
<p>- How many of the 100 odd people arrested for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; by the Metropolitan Police on 20th March were a) black and b) Asian?</p>
<p>- How much of the Met&rsquo;s total budget for the financial year ending 5/4/2001 (or any other accounting period you use) has been spent on &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; measures including training?</p>
<p>- How much of the Met&rsquo;s total budget for the financial year ending 5/4/2001 (or any other accounting period you use) has been spent investigating crimes formally classified as racist by the Met?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Robert Henderson</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>

<p>Dear Mr Grieve,</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter of 26th April about the case raised by Mr Robert Henderson of 156 Levita House, Chalton Street, London NWl 1 HR, about the remarks attributed to the Director General of the BBC.</p>
<p>You will not be surprised to know that I am well aware of the demands on police time and resources and support the priority of tackling serious crime. However, I simply put it to you: what would have happened had I referred to the music profession as being &#8220;hideously black&#8221;. Can you not imagine that you would have been faced with calls for me to be prosecuted and Mr Hague called upon to expel me from the Conservative Party?</p>
<p>It is that inequality of treatment which I find so offensive.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Gerald Howorth MP</p>

		<p>If (the former) Great Britain were populated by British people you would really only have to worry about the occasional wacky Irishman.</p>
<p>Now you have to worry about Chinamen, Muslims and Blacks trying harassing the natives, stifling free speech and attempting to win the ghetto lottery.</p>
<p>The elected officials have really declared war on the British people and won&rsquo;t be happy until the are completely subjugated by aliens.  But what makes them think they will stay in power once their people have been genocided out of existence?  Why would a Muslim or Black want an Englishman or Scot in office or head of anything?  Did they really think this out?<br>

		<p> You know these types of cases appear to me to give one citizen the right to harass another citizen by fiegniing outrage and getting the police to really look over the other citizen and tie him/her up begging that they are not guilty and are kumbaya types. &#8220;Really Officer!&#8221; These laws show who is in charge and you better watch your step to the point of obeisance.</p>

		<p>During most of the twentieth century conservatives in the United States were the chief offenders against intellectual freedom. By using black lists, witch hunts, and loyalty oaths they made it dangerous to criticize capitalism, advocate socialism, or say anything good about Communist countries.<br>
 <br>
This came to an end during the late 1960s when the unpopularity of the War in Vietnam made it possible to examine the policies and principles that lead to that conflict. <br>
 <br>
Since then liberals have been the chief offenders against intellectual freedom. They have made it dangerous to argue that genetics has a strong influence on human behavior and potential, and on racial differences. <br>
 <br>
Conservatives in the past, and liberals now, impede the honest discussion of social and political problems a democracy needs in order to thrive. </p>

		<p>The only way to overthrow the PC tyranny is to jump aboard and file complaints.  If you feel it is beneath you, do it to illustrate the hypocrisy and anti-white elements present in PC.</p>
<p>To merely complain about it is to do nothing.  Jump in, join in.  File complaints and go public.</p>

		<p>Race baiting and Cop baiting are not equal crimes.</p>
<p>This is a good way to find yourself on the receiving end of some very sharp cuffs alongside head and ears and/or a frivolous but threatening prosecution for any of a number of petty crimes which cops can &#8216;engineer&rsquo; for you to be the master of.</p>

		<p>I used to think that France would be the first to fall to muslims, sadly now I think it&rsquo;ll be the U.K.. I think that I will witness Buckingham Palace over run and burned to the ground in my lifetime. I went to London in the mid 70&rsquo;s and remember seeing just afew non-White faces and had a great time. This is a really sad ending to a once proud country and people whom I consider our brothers and sisters. The &#8220;Royals&#8221; and leaders of the U.K. shamelessly cower to the muslims ( as in this country ) and are totally worthless as they are the ones handing their country over to the invaders. Behind closed doors the &#8216;real&rsquo; British are mad as hell and reaching the boiling point. But ( as in this country ) they have been beaten into silence by a small group of &#8216;progressives&rsquo;. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why they keep voting for the very people that allow this to go on, mention the BNP to these people and they they get angry or act as if they&rsquo;ve seen a ghost. My only hope is when other White nations see the British drug out and slaughtered in the streets in the final push, they&rsquo;ll understand thats THEIR future and will come to their senses.    </p>

		<p>Wow this from nation that gave us the &ldquo;Sex Pistols&rdquo;.   Warning to all London street musicians don&rsquo;t sing &ldquo;Rock The Casbah&rdquo; from the Clash when a Arab immigrant walks by or you will be arrested.   Of course there Commonwealth cousins up north can no longer play Dire Straits &ldquo;Money for Nothing&rdquo; because it uses the word faggot.

They are the furthest along the road of &#8220;political correctness&#8221;, and also the closest to insanity.

<p>They aren&rsquo;t like us and for the most part will NEVER be like us. They don&rsquo;t embrace Western values and mores and they refuse to assimilate. How does all this diversity benefit we Causcasians who inspired by our ancesotrs created the Western societies- some exotic restaurants?

<p>Maybe there is no answer. It might as well just be a curse sent by God as a punishment for past and current sins (real ones, not &#8220;racism&#8221;). Who knows or can know how this ever happened. It&rsquo;s permeated deeply enough into culture, and is seen so much in seemingly normal people, that conspiracy theories don&rsquo;t even look necessary.</p>

England&rsquo;s last-ditch fading hope is the BNP, alas, much of the white working class, especially the generational dole-parasites, will vote for Labour and their own genocide, to insure themselves a few more years on the public teat. The English Bourgeoisie will vote for the equally anti-white Conservatives to avoid the ignominy of voting for the allegedly &#8220;prolo&#8221; BNP. &#8220;Perfidious Albion&#8221; chokes to death on its own vomitus.

		<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand why they all keep moving to our countries when they have so many grievances with us and our culture. The only thing I can think of is the countries and cultures they come from have failed them.oddly they cling to those failed cultures and use our cultures freedoms to legislate special rights to essentially live and behave as they did in the lands they fled.adding insult to injury we are now being forcefully made to assimilate our own countries and forced to foot the bill as well. It would seem our children can look forward to lives of paying the bills for immigrants and refugees that our own neighbors have helped teach to hate us to appease a learned self guilt or hate based on irrational ideas reinforced for decades by our geniuses in uber liberal academia.  You know the same academia that several hundred years ago assured us that blacks and asians where inferior and now works feverishly to convince us that we are the deeply flawed folks and it&rsquo;s all our fault&hellip;&hellip;.insane.</p>

		<p>Britain is not great anymore and needs a revolution. It&rsquo;s well past rescue via the ballot box.<br>
John Engleman&rsquo;s regurgitation of tired old leftist agit-prop doesn&rsquo;t surprise me but simply appalls.<br>
The Left has been in control of the entire US intellectual-media-cultural scene for a century. <br>
Richard Rovere, who penned the most vicious hatchet job on McCarthy, admitted that criticizing him in the early 50s was as dangerous as drinking his morning cup of coffee. <br>
Everyone was doing it.<br>
The real blacklist in Hollywood was against the Friendly Ten to HUAC who testified as to Soviet propaganda in Hollywood films.<br>
Ayn Rand, Adolphe Menjou and others were blacklisted by the liberal Commies in Hollywood and only TV saved Reagan&rsquo;s acting career.<br>
McCarthy was right in his exposures of old State Department Communists that FDR &amp; Truman had allowed to infiltrate the State Department and other FedGov agencies. See Blacklisted By History by M. Stanton Evans.<br>
These &#8216;poor&rsquo; persecuted Communists in Hollywood, FedGov and Academia supported the USSR which killed at least 70-80 million people and Mao who killed 110 million people.<br>
The Communist Party membership cards of all of the Hollywood Ten<br>
were reproduced. These are the same people who were even then plotting to bring Comrade Dr. King&rsquo;s civil wrongs legislation into being.<br>
Save your crocodile tears, Engelman, and get your history straight before you recycle leftist longstanding nonsense. </p>

		<p>Nearly 994,138 members of the UK were killed in WW I, 400,000 killed in WW II. Millions more were scarred by the experience, physically and mentally. (source:  Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The British sacrificed their people FOR THIS, fought FOR THIS?  To see their country turned into an upside-down  Orwellian, totalitarian world whose Reign of Terror &#8220;intrudes into every aspect of life?&#8221;  A Reign of PC Terror directed at Native Born White Britons in their own homeland?

<p><i>This isn&rsquo;t the Britain We Fought For</i></p>
<p>https://goo.gl/RNY4q</p>
<p>Thirty-three year old Nicholas Pringle&hellip; sent letters to local newspapers across the country asking for those who lived through the war to answer the following:</p>
<p><i>Are you happy with how your country has turned out?</i> </p>
<p>Answers came from those in their 80s and 90s and were a resounding &#8220;NO.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Our country has been given away to foreigners while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services because incomers come first.</i></p>
<p><i>People come here, get everything they ask, for free, laughing at our expense.</i></p>
<p><i>We are affronted by the appearance of Muslim and Sikh costumes on our streets.</i></p>
<p>In a few years, we Americans will be asking our own generation of pensioners, those subjected to death panels and palliative-only care, that is IF they receive any care at all, if their sacrifices were worth it.   </p>
<p><i>I&rsquo;m guessing they probably should just arrest Roger Waters and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and throw away the key just to set an example.</i></p>
<p>I am a true fan of British classic rock and often wonder how much longer it will be legal in Britain to listen to or own CDs of  Pink Floyd, The Who, Beatles, Queen, etc. </p>

		<p>Eventually it will be illegal in England to  publicly criticize immigration policy and to publicly state that you prefer a Native English Majority. When this happens, the Native English must  overthrow the &#8220;English&#8221; Goverment. Hopefully, Native English Patriots in the UK Miitary will stage a coup and arrest every member of Parliament for high treason. </p>
<p>Kevin McDonald recently wrote that the full-blown revolt against race-replacement  will commence in Europe. I agree with Kevin on this point. I have believed this for at least the past four years. And the reason why I believe it will occur in Europe first is because Europe is a much more densely populated area than America&hellip;there are no places to run away to in Europe as there still are in America and Canada. After Europe goes into full-blown insurrection against race-replacement, American will be nex,t and then finally Canada.</p>
<p>Jared</p>
<p>I hope you went after the Asians in our America in your new book&hellip;do this, and you will get lots of free publicity for the battle against  race-replacement. If you play it too safe, you will be ignored.</p>

<p>I realise that you were doing a parody extreme of what passes as debate over here - but as they say here, &#8220;never a truer word than said in jest&#8221;. </p>
<p>The far fetched notion of the &#8220;leftwing&#8221; wanting blacks to be in the Royal family have already been aired. </p>
<p>Although Peter Tatchell is just an annoying &#8220;rights&#8221; activist (usually gay rights, seeing as he is homosexual) - he already mused in the national press over the &#8220;whiteness&#8221; of the Royals and the royal system. </p>
<p>I even managed to find a link on the A.R website! </p>
<p><a href="/news/2010/01/no_we_cant_the.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2010/01/no_we_cant_the.php</a></p>

<p>&#8220;In Britain, however, we can only dream of a black head of state. It isn&rsquo;t going to happen any time soon because the UK system is rigged against a black leader. Black and Asian Britons are effectively barred by the system of hereditary monarchy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the hereditary method of choosing the British head of state from the all-white Windsor family is racially exclusive and is racist in its consequence.</p>
<p>Equally appalling, this exclusion of non-white Britons excites no public outrage, not even from liberals, the left and African British anti-racist campaign groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;this manner of determining Britain&rsquo;s head of state is surely an offensive, bigoted anachronism. It is premised on the assumption that the most ignorant, stupid, immoral white Windsor is more entitled to be head of state than the best-informed, wisest and most moral black Briton. This is a truly repulsive racist assumption.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true, of course, that Britain could one day have a black head of state. If a future monarch married a non-white person, their first born child could ascend to the throne and become head of state. But this is a matter of &ldquo;if&rdquo; and &ldquo;could&rdquo;. There is no guarantee at all. In any case, why should black and Asian Britons have to wait in line for generations? It is a vile insult to make them stand at the back of the queue for the office of head of state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If William married a black British woman his first-born male child from that marriage could inherit the head of state title, but only on William&rsquo;s death, which is likely to be more than half a century from now, in about 2080. The possibility that Britain could have a non-white head of state, like the US, is still a distant dream.&#8221;<br>

<p>Yes. This is the kind of sickness we have been subjected to for decades. </p>
<p>There is only one plus to come from these kinds of &#8220;kung fu fighting&#8221; stories in the press, and that is how it is creating a &#8220;tedious&#8221; and &#8220;sick of it&#8221; feeling at last. It is getting that saturating and absurd that the sheen of it is hopefully going to rub off. </p>
<p>Yet, in the usual British way, as a nation we sadly moan and whine and complain to each other, tut, sigh, roll the eyes, and nothing really changes. </p>
<p>One day, I hope people will snap in a fit of retribution and put this insidious creeping of annihilation on the reverse cusp. I shall not be holding my breath, but I can live in hope. </p>

In most countries in the world you would be correct. In fact, in most countries the response of those with power is simply to kill, torture and imprison those who defy.

<p>If you are stupid enough to engage in violent abuse or threats, especially in the form of letters or emails sent directly to the person you may get caught, but if you stick to criticism and satirical mockery you are safe provided you do not show yourself to be afraid. </p>
<p>If you want a dramatic example of this, then have a look at my experiences when Tony and Cherie Blair attempted to have me charged with sending malicious communications during the 1997 UK General election -</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/USGjj" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/USGjj</a></p>
<p>As soon as I discovered that they had been to the police (this discovery was made only when the Mirror newspaper published a story about their failed attempt for the police never contacted me),  I went on the attack making the entire mainstream UK media and much of our political establishment aware of what they had attempted. That killed any further attempt at prosecution after Blair became Prime Minister, although I was subject to harassment via the Internet and phone until Blair ceased to be PM.</p>
<p>Protest should always be made where it is practical. It still is in Britain provided you have a bit of nous and moral courage. </p>
