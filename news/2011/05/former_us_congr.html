<h1>Former U.S. Congresswoman McKinney Speaks on State TV in Libya</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, May 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former U.S. congresswoman slammed U.S. policy on Libyan state TV late Saturday and stressed the &#8220;last thing we need to do is spend money on death, destruction and war.&#8221;</p>
<p>The station is fiercely loyal to Moammar Gadhafi and her interview was spliced with what appeared to be rallies in support of the embattled Libyan leader.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said she was invited to Libya by the &#8220;nongovernmental organization for fact-finding,&#8221; adding that she intends to bring more people to the country soon so that &#8220;they too can understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The former Georgia representative also slammed the economic policies of U.S. President Barack Obama and said the government of the United States no longer represents the interests of the American people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the economic policies of the Obama administration, those who have the least are losing the most. And those who have the most are getting even more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The situation in the United States is becoming more dire for average ordinary Americans, and the last thing we need to do is to spend money on death, destruction and war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Separately, McKinney appeared on state-run Press TV this week in Iran. She was reported to be in Tehran attending the International Conference on Global Alliance Against Terrorism for a Just Peace.<br>

		<p>There is a black racist  newspaper in San Francisco called Bayview.It always whines about how awful Whitey is, it regularly has words by the cop killer Mumia, it says that he didnt kill officer Faulkner, it continually praises the most vile black racists hate groups and black racists, and lately it supported Khadafy, because he gave some moolah to their favorite black racist hate group, the Nation of Islam.I wonder if they know that Khadafy used black Africans as cannon fodder to try to fight the rebels in Libya, and a lot of them took a terrible beating?McKinney should join them.</p>

		<p>Well, I frankly can&rsquo;t say that the Congresswoman is at all wrong, though the Jane Fondaesque routine is not the way to convey this message and I&rsquo;m sure her &#8216;African Americans&rsquo; comment buys her no pity or admiration as Arabs and Berbers have little respect for blacks.</p>
<p>To get a better idea of just how tenuous a fingerhold the Libyan Rebels have on this revolution, I recommend looking at the CNN video at the bottom of this page-</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/hFC8P</p>
<p>Poor dumb guys started the campaign with a Lee Enfield (WWI) rifle held together with tape and managed to pick up a mixed bag of RPD, FN-FAL and AK-47s.  They are holding open the neck of a &#8216;Wassim Corridor&rsquo; that forms the head of a 270km long mountain range but is itself a completely exposed run of some 25km width from the Tunisian border, straight to Tripoli.</p>
<p>Especially after seeing this video, I&rsquo;m sure that only the threat of NATO airstrikes are keeping the Libyan mechanized forces (shelling from the southern hills) from rolling up these people altogether.</p>
<p>Why should we care?  From about 1994 through to about 2003, Abdul Qadeer Khan sold Libya a minimum of half a billion dollars in uranium enrichment plant materials.  This included a giant (2 story tall, 200 tons) pumping system for the highly corrosive Uranium Hexafluoride gas built in South Africa, post Apartheid, and about 2,500 centrifuges (which were thankfully diverted to Italy under USN escort) from Malaysia along with at least two, 2-ton, cylinders of the UHF gas itself, courtesy of China.</p>
<p>Virtually an entire enrichment plant bought &#8216;off the shelf&rsquo; from the mad Pakistani scientist&rsquo;s contact list.</p>
<p>Once we had the centrifuges, the CIA waltzed in and said: &#8220;We are the lifeguard, you are the drowning man&hellip;&#8221; and Gaddafi took them at their word, hoping to set the stage for Libya&rsquo;s reentrance to the world so that his son could inherit his regime.</p>
<p>He likely did not give up all the stuff he had (atomic warhead designs) and he is most assuredly _never_ going to trust the West again.</p>
<p>Ignoring the threats to flood Europe with blacks, this is twice now that we have humiliated this man.  There won&rsquo;t be a third occasion and as long as he has oil to sell, he can buy nukes or chem/bio to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d better win.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t like McKinney at all, but I can&rsquo;t say I disagree with her that our wars and foreign occupations are a colossal waste of money.</p>

		<p>So many of these American Bantu are in love with the Colonel in Libya. Reverend Wright the mentor of President Obama. Louis Walcott [Farrakhan], this Mc Kinney, the late Khalid who was the protege of Louis, etc. In love with the African brother who doesn&rsquo;t mind or hesitate to kill other African brothers. Sure.</p>

		<p>I think Obama&rsquo;s intervention in Libya is a really bad idea. My only problem w/Louis Farrakhan&rsquo;s recent slamming of the Messiah is that his criticism would have a lot more credibility were it not for the allegations that Gaddafi sent him million$ under the table for decades.</p>
<p>Wonder if Ms. McKinney is getting her palm greased, too.</p>

		<p>The sad fact is that all of these out on the fringe Blacks who are attacking Obama is more likely to help him with White independents, his large mainstream Black base and others who may be under the belief that if the radical Blacks are mad with him then he must be more middle of the road than we think.</p>

		<p>Idiotic stuff for sure.  But I got a good feeling from this, &#8220;Former U.S. Congresswoman McKinney&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought she&rsquo;d be in there for life.  Obviously I don&rsquo;t watch much news.</p>

		<p>Do you think if Obama werent runnin in 2012 he would be bombing Libya picking his fights carefully? <br>
Why dont the media admit Libya has only a small 6 million population? Why havent you heard this even once? Wouldnt it make the most liberal socialist Obama look like a big bully picking on the easy little guys?</p>
<p>Why didnt he bomb Iran? Why didnt he bomb Syria? Is discression the better part of valor? Isnt that the bullies motto?</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat/Republican Lincolnites are all such lying cheating hypocrites. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know where exactly this fits in here, but in my view America never should have begun bombing Libya. We had no right to do so. We were not threatened or in any danger. We have involved ourselves in yet another faraway conflict. Nothing good will come of our continual interference in other countries.</p>

		<p>The present struggle to participate in a meaningful, productive effort to ensure that our people, the white race, have a future can be frustrating to those who are serious about the task.</p>
<p>The present discussion about Cynthia McKinney attempting to intervene and mediate in America&rsquo;s New War, now on Libya, is as good of a case as any.</p>
<p>We battle for the hearts and minds of our people and for our own souls.  And if we are sincere in our hopes for our own racially homogeneous homelands with our own government and military then we must allow the other people of this planet to have their own too.</p>
<p>It is really a cause for pause and a source of great sadness to see the bile and hatred eructed towards Cynthia McKinney and Gaddaffi of Libya.  Leaving the obvious trolls aside, the consensus appears to be: he is a kook who deserves to die while his country is completely destroyed and she is a black racist who hates all white people just because they are white and lets hope some of those NATO bombs fall on her too.</p>
<p>Now, Gaddaffi calls himself Mr. Africa and recently inaugurated the great man made river which is a 1000 year water supply for the desert country.  At the ceremony he invited the disenfranchised Egyptians to come to Libya, he invited the Palestinians to quit Gaza and Israel and come to Libya thus ending another excuse for some more war, he invited all homeless people of Africa to come to Libya and lastly he invited all good people of the earth to come to Libya and participate in the reclaiming of the desert and the building of the greatest agricultural  country on the earth.  Libya would offer: free land, free water, free electricity and very reasonable financing for the necessary equipment. </p>
<p>Most people in America have never heard of this.  I doubt if very many AmRenners have either.  Most prefer the topical excuses&hellip; he wears a funny hat and she slapped a guard at the congress building for trying to feel her up in a weapons search at the representatives entrance where she was a known entity then holding a seat in congress.</p>
<p>Theoretically, where there is life there is hope. Lets hope that people become really serious about our future and try to figure out a way to solve our problems instead of  going along with the politically correct suicide.</p>
