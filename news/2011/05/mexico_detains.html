			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, May 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police on Tuesday detained 513 undocumented migrants from Latin America and Asia who were crammed into two trucks bound for the United States, prosecutors in southeast Mexico said.</p>
<p>The migrants, from Latin America, Japan, China, India and Nepal, &#8220;were traveling in inhuman conditions&#8221; in the southeastern state of Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border, the local attorney general&rsquo;s office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Police stopped the trucks, carrying 240 and 273 people, on the outskirts of state capital Tuxtla Gutierrez early Tuesday, after they accelerated through a vehicle scanner at a police checkpoint, the statement said.</p>
<p>Officers chased down the vehicles shortly afterward, it added.</p>
<p>Police detained the Mexican drivers of the two trucks, and the migrants were provided with aid and food, the statement said.</p>
<p>Mexican lawmakers last month unanimously approved a law to &#8220;strengthen the protection and security&#8221; of migrants amid widespread abuse.</p>
<p>Rights groups have long criticized Mexico for failing to protect tens of thousands of migrants, mainly from Central America, trying to cross the vast country to illegally enter the US each year.</p>
<p>The gruesome discovery of 72 murdered migrants from Central and South America in northeastern Tamaulipas state last August increased pressure on the government to act.<br>

		<p>Arizona&rsquo;s &#8220;much derided&#8221; SB 1070 has a provision about seizing vehicles that are used to transport/cram jam 10 or more illegal aliens at a time.  The DOJ/SG actually wanted the trial level court judge in Phoenix and the 9th Circus Court of Appeals in San Francisco to put that particular provision into injunction, but in both venues, the courts found for Arizona.  So as of this day, that provision in SB 1070 is in effect and enforceable. </p>

		<p>On the news they said that these people had paid $7,000 apiece to be transported to the U.S. We hear this all the time in these stories, $5,000, $7,000, $10,000. I thought these people were poor. Where are they getting that kind of money? Anyone have any thoughts on this? </p>

		<p>Probably destined to work for Iron Mountain, the largest file storage company in America which does the file storage for virtually all government agencies and government educational institutions in the country.</p>
<p>The major qualification to work for Iron Mountain is to speak only some pre literate S. American Indian language which no one other than a few hundred thousand fellow tribespeople understand.<br>
Another qualification is the desire to live on 3 decker bunkbeds in the warehouses with the files.</p>

The money is borrowed at high interest rates from the employers.  The smugglers in the home country threaten and sometimes kill the relatives who are often children left behind.  The payments are deducted from the paychecks.</p>
