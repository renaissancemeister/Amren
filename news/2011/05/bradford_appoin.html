			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bradford council has announced that the city has appointed the UK&rsquo;s first female Muslim Lord Mayor.</p>
<p>Councillor Naveeda Ikram was nominated by the council&rsquo;s Labour Group to serve as Lord Mayor in the West Yorkshire city.</p>
<p>The mother-of-three, who was born in the UK, was given the title during a ceremony at Bradford City Hall today.</p>
<p>Cllr Ikram spent some of her teenage years in the Punjab, but has lived in Bradford for most of her life.</p>
<p>A psychology and sociology graduate, Mrs Ikram has served as deputy Lord Mayor of Bradford since 2009.</p>
<p>She will serve as Mayor for at least one year, with her husband Saqib Salam Shah serving as her consort.</p>
<p>Mrs Ikram, a Labour councillor for Little Horton, Bradford, since 2004, will, along with her husband succeed Peter Hill and his wife Gillian.</p>
<p>Aswell as becoming the UK&rsquo;s first female Muslim Lord Mayor, she was also the first woman of Pakistani origin to become a councillor in Bradford.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I am the first British female Muslim Lord Mayor. It shows the progress that has been made in this country.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am looking forward to being a positive and active ambassador for this wonderful district.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m keen to see more participation and better confidence from all communities in the democratic process. </p>
<p>&#8216;I can say whole-heartedly I have had overwhelming and massive support and as a British Asian I think it shows what a tolerant society we are living in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Ikram said she wanted to focus on community cohesion on Bradford during her time in office.</p>
<p>Her father came to Britain from the Punjab in the mid-1960s and began working for Cadbury&rsquo;s in Birmingham before landing a job at the Habib Bank.</p>
<p>He ended up as a bank manager and his family settled in the Little Horton area of Bradford, which Mrs Ikram has represented since 2004.</p>
<p>Indian-born Manjula Sood became Britain&rsquo;s first Asian woman Lord Mayor in Leicester in 2008, while Councillor Asad Omar became Britain&rsquo;s first Muslim Mayor when he took the office in Harrow last year.<br>

		<p>PC in the UK really goes out of its way to push Muslims to the top of government. Their liberals claim that UK society doesn&rsquo;t do enough to &#8220;integrate&#8221; non-White immigrants/subjects, and yet this article is so preoccupied with this mayor&rsquo;s &#8220;Asian&#8221; and &#8220;Muslim&#8221; composition - similar to how liberal Americans never stop talking about Obama&rsquo;s blackness. How can a society &#8220;integrate&#8221; if the concentration is always on the differences? Liberal logic is so hopelessly warped.</p>
<p> &lsquo;I am the first British female Muslim Lord Mayor. It shows the progress that has been made in this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This woman wears her labels like a prostitute wears cheap jewelry. To what progress is he refering? Are religion and gender qualifications to achieve political status in the UK? Would a qualified British feamle Christian mayor be set back?</p>
<p>Bradford is a city either full of Muslims or a city full of non-Muslim idiots.</p>

		<p>In very short order &#8220;Great Britain&#8221; will be merely a footnote in the history books.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see when the constitution, monarchy, language and culture are all just a piece of history.</p>
<p>The new era is one without the British.</p>
<p>But they have brought it upon themselves, cannot blame the foreigners, they are just doing what they can to take advantage of western society, it is the electorate, the British who have undertaken policies that lead to their ultimate destruction.</p>

		<p>I see it now, Mustafah abas Singh has now been appointed as the first muslim male queen&rsquo;s consort..this shows how far the Emerald Isles have come regarding tolerance and diversity. I looked it up, 30% of the English parliament is Pakistani born muslims, Tower Hamlets is ALL Paki muslims and a very dangerous city and it is spreading rapidly just like the Normandy beach head&hellip;let em get ashore, and it&rsquo;s all over but the groveling.</p>

		<p>How about she brink her &#8220;progress&#8221; to Pakistan? Surely Pakistan is in need of &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is it not? Where is Pakistan&rsquo;s first non-Pakistani female Christian mayor? Why would Pakistan not allow non-Pakistanis to hold office? Is that not RACIST? Two can play at this political game. I remember reading a while back about some asian complaining that the British Monarchy is &#8220;unfair&#8221; to foreigners. How Fair are Asian ountries? Non Brits should NOT feel entitled to positions in British government!!! Every time some foreigner spouts that crap, we will demand positions in the Governments of their countries of origin and make them more &#8220;White-friendly&#8221;. Minimise the asiacentric bias in Pakistan and India! Sounds crazy for India to not be pro-Indian? Then let Britain be pro-British!!!</p>

		<p>#3: It could happen to you. Demographically, you&rsquo;re in far deeper trouble than much of Europe, and that&rsquo;s nothing to celebrate wherever it happens. What do you hope to achieve by telling other White nations that they &#8220;deserve it&#8221; or by gloating over the possible demise of one of our own?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping that you, us and the rest of Europe see off the scourges of Third World invasion and can once again build societies that push back the boundaries of achievement and knowledge, rather than pour our efforts as we do now into the ungrateful maws of parasites and enemies.</p>

		<p>Think I am right in saying that a Mayor in England does not have the same powers that one of yours has.  Here they are largely ceremonial.  A new one is generally appointed every year, voted for from within the local Council.  Each party taking turns to pick one of their number.</p>

		<p>Tablighi Jamaat was founded in 1926, in India, by a Deobandi scholar, Muhammad Ilyas, who wanted to raise Islamic awareness among rural Muslims in south Asia. He promised them that by obeying Islamic laws and following the example of the Prophet Muhammad in their personal lives they would one day &ldquo;dominate over non-believers&rdquo; and become &ldquo;masters of everything on this earth&rdquo;.  Ishaq Patel, Tablighi Jamaat&rsquo;s first amir (leader) in Britain, is said to have been on pilgrimage in Mecca when Ilyas&rsquo;s successor gave him a long-term mission to win &ldquo;the whole of Britain to Islam&rdquo;. Yoginder Sikand, a Muslim expert on the movement, says that its ethos of &ldquo;social and cultural separatism and insularity&rdquo; seeks &ldquo;to minimise contacts with people of other faiths&rdquo;. The self-segregation that this encourages is evident in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, where the group has its European headquarters. The Tablighi Jamaat complex – housing its large Markazi mosque and a Deobandi seminary called the Islamic Institute of Education - is based in the Savile Town area, which has an 88 per cent Asian population. The overwhelming majority of its 5,000 residents are Muslims from Pakistan or the Gujarat region of India and some, at home and at work, have little contact with nonMuslims. It was on the advice of a Tablighi Jamaat scholar that Aishah Azmi, a Dewsbury teaching assistant, refused to remove her full-face veil in the class-room while helping young children who were learning to speak English. One of the suicide bombers who attacked London in July 2005, Shehzad Tanweer, studied at the Deobandi seminary in Dewsbury and Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 terror plot, was a regular worshipper at the adjoining mosque. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, was said to have been influenced by Tablighi Jamaat, several of whose adherents were also among those arrested last year over an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic airliners. Shabbir Daji, a trustee and secretary of the Tablighi Jamaat mosque in Dewsbury, told The Times that the movement&rsquo;s aim was &ldquo;unity among all humanity&rdquo;. He said that it had no hidden agenda. &ldquo;We never come out on demonstrations against the Government,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our aim is to make each and everyone &hellip; a better Muslim.&rdquo;  Irfan al Alawi, international director of the Centre for Islamic Pluralism, says the missionary work of Tablighi Jamaat acts as &ldquo;a recruitment agency for jihad&rdquo; in Afghanistan, the occupied territories and Iraq. &ldquo;They go around deprived areas of British towns and cities, knocking on doors and urging young Muslims to come to their gatherings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The mega-mosque complex would become a flagship for Tablighi Jamaat&rsquo;s mission to indoctrinate Muslims with a hatred of the West and the kuffar [non-Mulims].&rdquo;  Tabligh Jamaat is expected to submit a formal planning application for the West Ham mosque before the end of the year. </p>

		<p>Bradford&hellip;wasn&rsquo;t that the town where ten years Asians rioted and set out to maim &amp; kill White Britons? Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;British Pakistanis hate White Britons with a passion. They&rsquo;re making entire cities no-go areas for the indigenous population. They pimp out and murder young White girls, yet White Britons give them ceremonial Lord Mayorships? Unbelievable&hellip;</p>

<p>As an Englishman, may I ask what we are &#8220;progressing&#8221; to - and how will we know when we get to the final destination?! </p>
<p>Of course, I am being pedantic. I know the answer. </p>
<p>What they are are progressing to is the displacement and overwhelming of /subjugation of the indigenous population. </p>
<p>We will know when we have &#8220;progressed&#8221; far enough when we cease to exist in our own country.  Only then would full &#8220;progress&#8221; have been achieved - and the horrible &#8216;racist&rsquo; resistance of our annihilation no longer be a threat. </p>
<p>This whole situation in Britain is insane. The entire population seem to be in need of medication because they are stood like grinning idiots clapping and cheering a speeding train hurtling towards them whilst they are stood in the middle of the tracks. </p>
<p>Britain, formerly dubbed by some Nationalists as &#8220;Air Strip One&#8221; for our reputation of collecting international arrivals&hellip;.is soon to be announced as being refurbished as the worlds largest open air mental institution. </p>
<p>Padded cushions will be provided to all visitors upon entry. </p>
<p>May the last sane, White, British person switch off the light at the end of the shift. Thank-you. Management Staff. </p>
<p>(Talking of lights, I used to think there was a light at the end of the tunnel&hellip;..but unfortunately it ended up being two African economic refugees with torches, coming through the channel tunnel). </p>
