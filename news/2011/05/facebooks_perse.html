<h1>Facebook&rsquo;s Persecution of Conservatives: Examining Evidence of Bias</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barry Secrest, Conservative Focus, September 5, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On August 24th, we published a news article which {snip} explained how Conservative Journalist Jane Jamison&rsquo;s entire network of friends and contacts, built up over a number of years, was expunged from Facebook for no clear reason.</p>
<p>When Jane requested a reason, she was pretty much given the cold shoulder by Facebook. Knowing that the Digital World can often be a haphazard thing at best, a number of individuals might say as a result, &#8220;well, that happens all the time  &mdash;  no big deal  &mdash;  grow up.&#8221; However, the mystery deepens when another Conservative activist with a respectable web presence was also deleted without so much as a warning or &#8221; buh-bye.&#8221; This, just a scant few weeks before, <em>and even worse, that Conservative was me.</em></p>
<p>Having a legion of friends and contacts built up over years, unceremoniously swept out of your life leaves you wondering: How am I going to piece all of these friends and affiliations back together again? What am I going to do to fix this? The answer; not much can be done.</p>
<p>Between Jane Jamison and my network of contacts, the both of us have lost over 8,000 friends and contacts which had been built up over a number of years. No small thing, as one can see. My &#8220;unfortunate occurrence&#8221; just so happens to have occurred right at the time of publishing my first book, <cite>A Perfect Liberal Storm,</cite> which is admittedly &#8220;heavily dismissive&#8221; of those currently in power in Washington and specifically documents why. Jane&rsquo;s &#8220;bad stroke of luck&#8221; occurred right after she had published an article which was stringently critical of a local and very well-known California Democrat, Jerry Brown, for a number of documented reasons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The Facebook News Article and the Telltale Comments by Readers</b></p>
<p>When the news article titled &#8220;Facebook shutting down Conservatives? Identities being deleted without notice&#8221; was released  &mdash;  this website  &mdash;  which was re-released on a high-volume server back in June due to traffic increases, actually groaned just a bit for the first time  &mdash;  such was the volume of traffic. The article was picked up by Conservatives all over Facebook and the web and continues to spark conversations about biased censorship due to political affiliation.</p>
<p>The comments that have been published with the article mentioned above detail many instances of right-wingers&rsquo; profiles being unceremoniously dumped without warning. However there is much, much more.</p>
<p>There are many comments that both Jane and I have received that were sent to us via our &#8220;new Facebook identities&#8221; as a result of the article. One young and very upset lady, whose name is Marix, wrote me a heartfelt letter in which she desperately needed her extensive Facebook contact list back so that she could carry on with her work raising awareness of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. {snip}</p>
<p>In other instances, we have heard of the dirty tricks that our ideological opposites play on unsuspecting Conservatives. In one scenario a gaggle of Facebook Liberals acted in concert in order to have Conservatives removed who often espoused an effective viewpoint by &#8220;reporting them&#8221; to the Facebook administration, which will often result in the Facebook powers-that-be wiping that individual&rsquo;s profile from the planet, due process be damned. In other scenarios we have learned that it&rsquo;s not just Conservatives, but rather there are also a number of Christians who have had their comments and even profiles deleted for putting forth their religious points of view in an effective manner. When we checked into those particular assertions, we found, among them, a Muslim Facebook site  &mdash;  which a member kindly sent to us  &mdash;  where the founders crowed &#8220;they are skared of us&#8221; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seeming to mock Americans. Jane also received a number of messages from &#8220;certain politicians&#8221; who have also had their profiles deleted.</p>
<p>We saw other reports of Facebook freezing profiles for a length time, ostensibly as a result of the posting of Conservative links and stories  &mdash;  almost as punishment much like the temporary sting of a &#8220;ruler thrashing&#8221; across the palm of the hand  &mdash;  which some of us suffered as children.</p>
<p>We even saw a number of suggestions that a &#8220;Conservative Networking&#8221; site be established so that people could post, speak and otherwise interact freely without fear of being expunged.</p>
<p>In other accounts we heard of individuals being messaged that they must provide a cell phone number or Driver&rsquo;s License in order to confirm one&rsquo;s identity in order to post further.</p>
<p>We read a number of accounts where, upon being deleted, the offenders were messaged by Facebook <em>as much as six weeks later,</em> which warned that threatening or abusive actions would not be tolerated and deletion would occur. Oh, gee .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thanks for the warning.</p>
<p>One particularly memorable message wryly noted to Jane that it was ironic that Facebook required a birth certificate from a member in order to even consider re-instating their account when no such requirement was made for Obama to become President of the United States (no less.) Good Point!</p>
<p>Another message was from a member who had created a page which was titled &#8220;No to Ground Zero Mosque&#8221; and reported having 107,000 members. That page was apparently deleted by Facebook. When the member tried to recreate the page, she was rewarded with a message from Facebook stating, &#8220;New Pages titled No Ground Zero Mosque&#8221; will no longer be allowed. Free speech we can believe in, no doubt. We do note, in this case, the recent report of an AP released directive to reporters (most likely originating from the White House) which indicated that &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221; would be removed from any further news article references to the proposed Mosque. Hmm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So the next logical question becomes: &#8220;Are Liberals treated in the same way?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer from everything we could find was a resounding &#8220;NO.&#8221;</p>
<p>When researching this possibility, in order to discern if it was happening to ideologues from either camp, we could find no clear indication that the same sort of &#8220;purging&#8221; is being done to Liberals or Democrats. In fact, if you conduct a Google search on Liberals being deleted from Facebook, you will mostly come up with either pieces pointing to our earlier article or instances of various posts being deleted, but nothing identifying a vast Right-Wing conspiracy against the Left such as what we Conservatives might be experiencing from the Leftward.</p>
<p>The next logical question then becomes, why? {snip}</p>
<p>When we dig into the subject a bit further, we find that the Facebook Chief Operatives seem to have an ideological leaning which supports Obama and the Liberals and Democrats. In fact, Chris Kelly, the former Chief Privacy Officer of Facebook, is a well-known California Democratic political operative. In a report from Opensecrets.org, a particular article by Michael Beckel states that Kelly has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic Party causes or campaigns over the last several years.</p>
<p>The article further states that Kelly has donated at least $21,000 to Democratic causes since January 2009. Opensecrets goes on to detail a number of donations to various individuals, but then further states that Kelly donated to both Clinton and then later Obama in the 2008 Presidential campaign. While we have also learned from the article that Facebook has been in extensive contact with members of both the Congress and the Senate, we find that Facebook lobbying with regard to privacy issues has approached nearly a third of a million dollars, if not more, over the past two years.</p>
<p><b>The Facebook&#150;Obama Connection</b></p>
<p>We have also learned that during Obama&rsquo;s campaign, Facebook was specifically utilized as a means to further the President&rsquo;s message via social networking. In fact, Obama was the first Presidential Candidate to utilize Facebook &#8220;extensively&#8221; as a campaign medium, which attracted an estimated six million younger voters. The Obama Campaign actually brought onboard Chris Hughs, one of the three original Facebook founders, who was enamored of Obama in being a Candidate who could take advantage of Facebook&rsquo;s social networking while, apparently, feeding Hughs&rsquo; ideological persuasion. Hughs then started a highly successful website called mybarackobama.com, which is an online community dedicated to furthering Obama&rsquo;s ideology in all things.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hughs is credited in many circles with being the frontman responsible for Obama&rsquo;s election. {snip}</p>
<p>Another interesting fact detailed by the website Social Beat, indicates that Facebook was the only consumer internet company to actually lobby Federal Intelligence Agencies in 2009  &mdash;  <em>including the CIA.</em> This in comparison to Internet giants such as Google, Amazon and Apple  &mdash;  among others  &mdash;  who seemingly stayed away from such agencies. Facebook was the only one  &mdash;  but better yet, why again?</p>
<p>According to Kim-Mai Cutler, most of Facebook&rsquo;s D.C. &#8220;experiences&#8221; center around helping Legislators and otherwise utilize Facebook&rsquo;s social networking potential with regard to campaigns, etc.; however, a further note of interest would have to be Facebook&rsquo;s 2009 hiring of Tim Sparapani of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is a Liberal bastion of Left-Wing-think, despite Facebook&rsquo;s burgeoning use as a law enforcement tool which would seem to go against Civil liberties issues  &mdash;  at least in the past.</p>
<p>The ultimate test for Facebook bias would have to be the overall ideological set of both its members and its employees who control the actions of Facebook members. Since 2007, Facebook employees, as a whole, have donated over 97% of all of their political funding to the Democrats and Democratically-connected causes. A veritable smoking gun if you will.</p>
<p><b>The Ties That Blind</b></p>
<p>The Chief Officer of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has a reported net worth of $4 Billion dollars as a result of his Facebook operations, while Facebook earnings have been estimated to approach over $ 800 Million in 2010. Most of Facebook&rsquo;s income is derived from ads placed by members, as well as advertisements from various companies, including Microsoft  &mdash;  which outlaid over $50 Million to Facebook in 2009. Microsoft also owns 1.6 % of Facebook to date, however, we expect that number to most likely increase in the future. Facebook is currently owned by shareholders who trade in a private market only, and its employees own much of the shares of the company which was most recently estimated to have a value of $22 Billion in the private market. There have been reports that detail an IPO of Facebook in late 2011 or 2012.</p>
<p>When we look at all of these facts tied in together, we find that a strong case could be made regarding Facebook&rsquo;s seeming soft-attack on Conservatives, Libertarians and Republicans  &mdash;  and even certain Christians as details continue to emerge. The reports that we have informally received from various members do seem to indicate an ideological persecution of certain members who actively engage in supporting their various causes which are of a Conservative nature.</p>
<p>We can further confirm a number of deep-rooted ties to the Obama Administration and Facebook company officials, noting that Zuckerberg indicates himself only as an Independent and an Atheist while being an outspoken opponent of privacy issues  &mdash;  which puts him squarely in the camp opposing Constitutional Conservative principles.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we could find essentially no ties whatsoever which would indicate any Facebook affinity or connection whatsoever <em>with</em> those of the Right-Wing  &mdash;  beyond one tiny donation by one Facebook official to Republican Carly Fiorina of HP fame.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A simple word of caution. Please remember: Every time you sign onto Facebook, your IP address is logged along with your exact location. So imagine, if you will, <em>what might be next</em> for Conservatives and dissidents who oppose those in power while using a social network with designs that <em>could</em> be plotting against its own Users behind the scenes.</p>

It would be nice to know the policy and criteria for deletion. It likely wouldn&rsquo;t prevent Facebook from deleting at a whim but at least it would make their actions transparent.</p>
<p>Minorities love to whine about discrimination and unfair treatment. My response is always, &#8216;if you don&rsquo;t like how you&rsquo;re treated, do for yourself&rsquo;. I offer the same advice here.</p>
<p>While this is outrageous, it should be seen as an opportunity to start a rival Facebook; not only for conservative but for everyone interested in free speech.</p>
<p>Complaining, protesting, and exposing this abuse is well and good but clearly the game is stacked against conservatives. </p>
<p>As they say, &#8216;when one door closes, another door opens&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The door has been slammed in our face[book]. Fine. Open a new door.<br>

		<p>Facebook also warns and deletes single men who are too aggressive in propositioning women, or who simply click on the link inviting other customers (women) to friends. This happened to me, anyway. No warning or notice. I assume that was the reason. Perhaps another customer complained or said i was &#8216;spam&rsquo;.  Their prompt &#8216;action&rsquo; could be one reason facebook is the service of choice. I wrote Facebook, at their customer service link, a letter (that what was not the most tactful one in the world - thinking anything would be done) to complain. Facebook reopened my account simple as that. </p>
<p>There may be something to this article though. For Facebook accounts dedicated to something like &#8216;Blackpower&rsquo; often have millions of members, who are proud of being a member, while sites named something like &#8216;whitepower&rsquo; could be taken down. AmRen&rsquo;s covered that before. Liberal causes are often seen as &#8216;being on the good side&rsquo;, even when they are about what at one time would have been thought disgusting or wrong; while conservative issues can be considered &#8216;suspect&rsquo; buy the similarly influenced public. I suspect there&rsquo;s something more to this story, however.. </p>

		<p>Bernard Goldberg pointed out, in his book &#8216;Bias&rsquo; when the complaints about &#8216;the liberal media&rsquo; finally began to reach the ears of the public at large, the &#8216;smart&rsquo; people claimed instead there was a conservative bias in the &#8216;corporate&rsquo; media.</p>

		<p>Liberals in America have all the traits, use all the tactics of, and are MUCH more akin to, the National Socialist German Workers Party than the conservatives they are continually labeling as &#8220;nazis&#8221;.  They have completely adopted the Nazi playbook.</p>
<p>Socialize industry.  Stifle any open correspondence or speech any way possible that is adverse to the liberals.  Disrupt meetings with thuggish tactics.  Walk out of Legislatures to disable any votes not to their liking.  Launch a media campaign demonizing their opponents and slandering them continually, reducing them to subhuman, unintelligent, criminal characterizations.  Install a &#8220;citizen police force&#8221; (remember Obama&rsquo;s ideas on that?) which is answerable only to the Leader.  All of this has come to pass.  All of it.  And every single one was done by the Nazi Party to seize control and rule with criminal impunity over the entire country.  Any dissent resulted in deportation to &#8220;labor camps&#8221;  I have no doubt that is in the future if things are not turned around.  However, the point is, the Liberals, Obama and the treason lobby, the SEIU union thugs, and the rest of that bunch are employing Nazi tactics verbatim while calling those who LOVE freedom and the Constitution &#8220;nazis&#8221;.<br>
Facebook is just one of the venues liberals have control over.  They pretty much control all media, all entertainment and most newspapers and print news.</p>

		<p>I signed up and opened an account on Facebook about 5 days ago at friends urging. I quickly read stuff on their policy etc, and decided that I did not want anything to do with them. I canceled my account the same day. I sure wouldn&rsquo;t put up a photo or give my location and all the other stuff they asked for so I KNEW right then, this is something I wanted no part of, period. </p>
<p>If I want to contact family and friends I use my email, period. Even that is iffy in today&rsquo;s internet snooping. If you are WHITE and a conservative, and don&rsquo;t play along with those in charge, you will be targeted. I am thinking of stopping my internet account also because of how easy it is for anyone (police, government,&#8221;hate&#8221; police, etc) to &#8220;plant&#8221; sites or info into your hard drive. Scary stuff, folks.  Is our ISP(?) address being recorded every time we log on recording any site that is of interest to us? </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about computers, ( I am an older White lady) only what I have read in the news, and I would like for maybe Amren to have something that helps educate us novices about what to do and not to do while surfing the net. </p>

		<p>I think we all know that Facebook is liberal. Now that we know they are also activist, good idea to keep that in mind. The good thing is that they&rsquo;re starting to show their colors early in the game, meaning there will be other alternatives to come in social networking. Deleting accounts for political reasons should give them some kind of black eye.  </p>

<p>====================================================<br>
Yes, but only up to this point:</p>
<p>Liberals can not, and will not ever put conservatives into labor camps, or move en masse in any aggressive way against Conservative white males. The reason?<br>
Quite simple. Liberals are panty- waists, and upon their first move of aggression, would find that their head was missing. Game over.</p>
<p>I agree that the Libs are in fact the only real Neo- Nazis on the planet. the ones claiming to be such, are deluded fools, just plain losers. </p>
<p>I agree that Liberals are incredibly dangerous to our existence, but only so long as we LET them cow us. </p>
<p>For no liberal is capable of facing down a strong white male conservative. They have no guts, no backbone, NOTHING in their minds that could prepare them for a real showdown.</p>
<p>No, when the end begins, Liberals will find themselves running, screaming and literally blathering in the streets, chased down and slaughtered, by the third worlders they once worshipped.</p>
<p>I will never fear anyone.</p>

		<p>i think most companies are this way because the government and pressure groups force them to - not because of ideology. </p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s has 365 black - ect, no problem, a similar white thing would prompt investigation from the government&hellip; </p>

		<p>I agree that a conservative alternative to Facebook should be established. When you look at the amount of money that Facebook is making, you&rsquo;d think that factor alone would encourage somebody with a good knowledge of computer programming to set one up. A few months ago I bought some advertising on Facebook. After reading about their intolerance of conservatives, I won&rsquo;t be buying any more from them.  </p>

		<p>I joined Facebook several years ago for 45 minutes!  I got nauseated by the self-glorifying that goes on!  Much of these &#8220;social networking&#8221; sites simply appeal to narcissism in folks.  Make friends the old fashioned way. In Person!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone would join Facebook to begin with.  Anyone you wish to email, you can.   Anyone you want to send pictures to, you can.  What&rsquo;s the point of Facebook?  The other thing is, Conservatives need to start being a pain in the rear to stupid Liberals in the same way as they are to them.  As an example, recently some goof was selling a button on eBay which featured Sarah Palin and that maniac that shot the Congresswoman.  Above then was the words, &#8220;Straight Shooters&#8221;.  I put in a complaint to Ebay making the point that they should not allow someone to use eBay to profit off a murderer.  I also let the Palin family know about it.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was my complaint or the likely complaints of others, but the listing was kicked off.  I know most conservatives don&rsquo;t tend to be whiners, but we have to start making ourselves heard.  Every day we encounter PC and other Liberal nonsense and we have to get in the habit of making noise about it.  The other day I got an email from the dealership that sold me my new car a few years ago, announcing a cinco-de-mayo sale.  I promptly responded back that I was an American and had no reason to celebrate CDM.  A couple years ago my public TV station had a week of Spanish language programing to celebrate Hispanic History Month.  I sent them a 5 peso Mexican bill and told them it was my contribution for the year.  I actually got a letter from the station manager asking if I had a problem with them airing operas in Italian or German.  When I responded to the letter, I mentioned that not many good, or even bad operas are coming out of Mexico.  Well, you get my point.</p>

		<p>I created a FB profile for myself, but quickly abandoned my account after realizing that you can either do Facebook or have a life, but not both.  I am hopelessly addicted to the opiates of eating, living indoors and driving, and the way I figured, I could kiss all these luxuries goodbye if I bothered with FB.</p>
<p>11 Fritz:  I&rsquo;m convinced that Cinco De Mayo has become nothing more than another drinking holiday.  Everyone is French and Catholic on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, everyone is Irish on March 17, and everyone is Mexican on May 5.  Except St. Louis operates by its own calendar   &mdash;   &#8220;Mardi&#8221; in &#8220;Mardi Gras&#8221; might mean &#8220;Tuesday&#8221; in standard French, but in the version they teach in St. Louis, it means the Saturday before.  You may have thought that St. Patrick passed on March 17, but in St. Louis time, he really passed on any convenient Saturday in mid-March.  You may think the minor Mexican victory over a French team of bench warmers was on May 5, but we all know around this town it happened on a Saturday in early May.  I swear, if the Birth of Christ had any plausible connotation to alcohol (and believe me, St. Louis tries), then Christ would have been born on the last Saturday in December, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Google it up as the next step in &#8216;accountability&rsquo; intimidation and restrictive communications tracking on -everyone-.</p>
<p>Realize that the next best thing to giving us a rope by which to hang ourselves is encouraging us to have an opinion by which to excoriate and label us.</p>
<p>You can also expect that the internet and certainly participation in certain groups on in will _not_ remain &#8216;free&rsquo; for long which means that those who pay to play (P2P, think online gaming) will have to &#8216;really want it&rsquo;.  And those who are only in it for casual awareness and social exchanges will be less and less likely to go to the effort of being part of something where they are not &#8216;one of the group&rsquo; accepted.</p>
<p>All of which will polarize and isolate us into skew demographics, robbing us of whatever ability to truly exchange ideas and form collective consensus through _opposition_ we may now have.</p>
<p>The right hand shakes the left, behind the back of the people who smile at us as they say &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s all going to be fine!&#8221;.  Forget this and you will fail to understand why we need our own country.</p>

<p>I am a computer and internet privacy advocate. There are several things you can do:</p>
<p>The first thing you should do is <b>immediately</b> stop using Google. Google records your IP address and all of your search terms forever, and they will not hesitate to turn those over in response to a subpoena. Internet search terms have been successfully used in several court cases. Instead, use Scroogle and DuckDuckGo for internet searches. https://ssl.scroogle.org and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com./" rel="nofollow">https://duckduckgo.com.</a></p>
<p>Use off-shore email. Off shore email accounts tend to place heavy emphasis on protecting their users&rsquo; privacy, and because they are in a foreign country they do not have to respond to subpoenas that come from your country. Runbox.com is the one I use. There is also NeoMailBox, MuteMail, and OffShoreInbox. (someone might recommend I2P mail, which I agree is a great solution, but it is just beyond the computer ability of the average user). </p>
<p>Ask a computer-savvy friend to encrypt your hard drive so anyone who turns it on will have to know your password to start the computer. While you might find typing a password every time you turn your computer on a nuissance, it can really pay off if your computer is seized or stolen. If you travel with a laptop and the TSA decides to search your laptop, and asks you for the password to boot it, refuse to give it to them. They will probably tell you that they can arrest you, but it isn&rsquo;t true. (In the UK, the police can arrest you for not turning over a password, but the police in the U.S.A. can&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>If encrypting your hard drive is too difficult, you can still get a little protection by storing your documents in password-protected folders. SafeHouse Explorer is a good one, but there are hundreds more. </p>
<p>Instead of sending documents to the recycle bin, shred them with a program like File Shredder. Governments, and people who steal computers, use a program like &#8220;Recuva&#8221; to recover documents that you think were deleted. If you shred documents, Recuva cannot recover them. This isn&rsquo;t a huge worry if you encrypt your hard drive, though. </p>
<p>Surf the internet using IronKey. It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s most secure flash drive. It comes with a portable browser and high-speed proxy server that will give you a new IP address when you visit sites. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want your internet connection to be in your name, I believe there are pay as you go mobile broadband services. I have never used these, but I&rsquo;ve heard of people being able to use the internet without the service being in their real name. They just buy more time with cash or prepaid cards. </p>
<p>There are more things you can do to protect your privacy, but these are the major ones. I sincerely hope that more people begin to see the need to protect their privacy and adopt these practices. </p>

<p><i>I am a computer and internet privacy advocate. There are several things you can do.</i></p>
<p>Thank you for the extremely useful information. </p>
<p>I subscribe to several very government/media-savvy  financial letters and recently, in the past few months, ALL of them have been warning us, in strong language to protect our privacy, to encrypt our hard drives, not to &#8220;trash&#8221;  documents but shred them,  surf the web in privacy via proxies, and to keep as much information as possible away from prying eyes, especially those of government snoops.</p>
<p>Some have asked me &#8220;What could <i>possibly</i> be on your computer that anyone would be interested in?  Who do you think you are, Natasha from the old Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle cartoon?  Aren&rsquo;t you being paranoid?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m an average person that does not trust this anti-White, war mongering, money grubbing government.</p>
<p>Do You?</p>
<p>And what with the government busily turning over every rock to look for new sources of revenue, hiring new IRS agents to aggressively seek out &#8220;hidden&#8221; money &#8220;owed&#8221; to the government,  searching for any cached treasure we Whites might have to turn over to them, or anything they can tax or use against us   &mdash;   it is prudent to be ever cautious. </p>
<p>Bill Clinton best exemplified the government&rsquo;s position when he said:  &#8220;I can spend your money better than you can.&#8221; </p>

<p>To protect your privacy, I also recommend using Skype as your primary phone, instead of a landline or cell phone. Skype uses its own encryption scheme which is not easily cracked. I recommend avoiding the iPhone altogether. </p>
<p>Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, and Paypal work hand and hand with law enforcement. Those, and a lot of other sites, are privacy nightmares. Don&rsquo;t use them, or at <i>least</i> register with a fake name when possible and use Tor (free), a VPN, or a proxy to log in. </p>
<p>Never use your real name or personal information (location, Date of Birth) when registering for any online discussion forums, and be careful what details you reveal about yourself in online discussions. Also, don&rsquo;t even make any jokes about bombs, terrorism, or anything that can be remotely construed as a threat to do damage to a person or property. </p>

		<p>If you don&rsquo;t want the government to know what you are doing, don&rsquo;t do it on your computer or the Internet. </p>
<p>If you want to discuss things with trusted conspirators, do it in person, not on the phone, and in a different location each time.</p>
<p>Read some Harold Covington novels. He has the entire subject of how to communicate securely in a hostile environment covered quite thoroughly.</p>

		<p>Thanks #15. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to post at a new site and will do it your way. The learning experience will justify the effort aside from any privacy concerns. Nevertheless, I do feel that my posts here are not something that I really want to hide from authorities. I hope they are reading this. Many agents will be convinced by our side. Great. Read on. Second, I like the show of force coming out of white people. We are many, and the authorities know it. With some proper leadership a social movement of whites who think like us can multiply quickly. If internet traffic counts scare the authorities, great. Let them be afraid.  </p>

<p>Ask him to use TrueCrypt to encrypt your hard drive. It&rsquo;s free. If he asks you which encryption to use (because TrueCrypt gives you several options) just go with the standard AES. You will also need a writeable CD as a kind of rescue disk in case your computer fails to boot. The encryption process will depend on the size of your hard drive. If I remember correctly, a 500 GB hard drive takes ~6 hours for TrueCrypt to encrypt. You can prepare for the whole process now by backing up all of your documents on an external storage drive. </p>
<p><i>What about Startpage.com? Is that safe or not?</i></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware of Startpage.com until you recommended it. But it looks good. If you access the internet with a laptop over WIFI, make sure to use their SSL version: <a href="https://startpage.com/" rel="nofollow">https://startpage.com/</a> </p>
<p>I think any company that promises to protect our privacy should be rewarded with our business. </p>
<p><i>What about all the stuff I have already used over the years? Like google, yahoo email?</i></p>
<p>For me, I just deleted all my messages that were stored in Hotmail and Yahoo and switched to Runbox. But deleted email will remain on the email company&rsquo;s servers for a while longer, until Hotmail and Yahoo delete them from their servers. Each email company has a different length of time that your deleted email remains on their servers. The shortest one I know by memory is AOL, which keeps your deleted email only 2 days before deleting them from their servers, and the longest one I know is PrivacyHarbor, which takes 30 days to delete your deleted email from their servers. Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail will be somewhere between 2 and 30 days. </p>
<p><i>Some have asked me &ldquo;What could possibly be on your computer that anyone would be interested in? Aren&rsquo;t you being paranoid?</i></p>
<p><i>No, I&rsquo;m an average person that does not trust this anti-White, war mongering, money grubbing government. Do you?</i></p>
<p>That question is probably rhetorical, but I will answer it anyway. No, I do not. And you shouldn&rsquo;t either. I personally believe that anyone who attends a pro-white or white rights advocacy meeting will be videotaped as they enter it by ideologically hostile groups who will feed that information to the FBI. I don&rsquo;t care how sophisticated or respectful of human rights that organization purports to be, anyone who sympathizes with it risks being deemed a threat and put under surveillance. You can simply make a joke about someone getting hurt or property getting damaged, and end up on a watch list.</p>
<p>The FBI also can keep personal information on people, and withhold that information from FOIA requests using creative wording. See <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/fbi-chastised-court-lying-about-existence" rel="nofollow">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/fbi-chastised-court-lying-about-existence</a></p>
<p>But you have another enemy, well-organized and funded, who will also keep a file on you, and will feed the information they gather on you to the FBI, and that group does not have to respond to a FOIA request. </p>

<p>I copied your very important posts into my permanent portfolio for future reference.  </p>
<p>I was reading a financial newsletters last night and tucked between an article as to whether or not to invest in water (yes, water) and the efficacy of buying into the insidious &#8220;rare&#8221; coins market was this:</p>
<p><i>Making Private Calls</i></p>
<p><i>Skype has very publicly told federal and corporate snoops to take a flying leap when it comes to monitoring.  Skype can do this because they&rsquo;re a P2P service meaning they directly connect two peers&rsquo; computers with one another and then encrypt the connection. They&rsquo;ve been  pressured by the government to turn over their encryption codes, but so far they are standing firm.</i></p>
<p><i>If you use Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk or other Internet-based communications clients, you can make them more secure by downloading Zfone (zfoneproject.com). It encrypts and protects any data transmissions.</i></p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
