	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After two young moms recently abandoned their newborn babies  &mdash;  one of whom did not survive  &mdash;  New York officials are proposing that high school curriculum include lessons on what mothers can do if they give birth to a baby they don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, State Sen. Eric Adams and State Assemblyman Hakim Jeffries are proposing state legislation requiring the change to high school health curriculum.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last weekend, a baby was thrown eight stories down a Brooklyn housing project trash chute and discovered hours later.</p>
<p>The baby boy fell on a mountain of trash and was miraculously not injured.<br/>
His mother, 18-year-old Laquasia Wright, was arrested on charges of attempted murder and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
<p>And just two weeks earlier, another newborn was found in the trash at a Queens hospital. The child was found alive but later died.</p>
<p>The mother, Dawa Lama, 23, was arrested.<br/>

		<p>Why no mugs shots of the so called mothers? Odd that when the story first broke of the one child that died they gave me the impression the mother and child was White. Why is that? The name of the mother whose baby she killed does not sound White? </p>

		<p>Why teach them anything? Why not just demonstrate that this is simply a &#8216;procedure&rsquo; that they can use if they find themselves pregnant..Why not simply re frame the  occurrence of dumping ones&rsquo; offspring down a trash chute as a &#8220;Post-Term Abortion?&#8221; Then praise the irresponsible little darlings for their &#8220;courage&#8221;&hellip;. ugh! To even refer to these two as mothers is offensive IMO. </p>
<p>I see the difference between this and the Obama-endorsed late term abortion as about 4 inches more of birth canal and 2 tiny lungfuls of air. That&rsquo;s the delineation between &#8220;fetus&#8221; and &#8220;baby&#8221;? God save us! </p>
<p>I believe the pro-life crowd needs to highlight this and illustrate the late term crowd by drawing such a parallel. </p>

		<p>A better program would be to try to prevent them from having them in the first place, but that would make too much sense.</p>

		<p>I remember quite a few years ago when NJ started its baby toss-away program.  The slogan was, if I recall, no name, no shame, no blame.  I was horrified at the thought that our society had sunk so low as to require a law allowing woman to abandon their children so they wouldn&rsquo;t harm them in some way.  Now, I know that there has always been the rare woman who murdered her child, and I know that children must occasionally be given up for adoption, but the fact that woman tossing babies out with the trash has become so common place as to require a &#8220;dumping allowed&#8221; law is scary.  How low have we sunk?</p>
<p>Mind you, this is significantly different than giving a baby up for adoption, which is a selfless act done for the good of the child.  These people literally treat children no differently than they would an old car that they would abandon on the side of the highway.  They have babies by whomever happens along.  They nurse them briefly and then off they go, back to the club to have another child.</p>
<p>I am perhaps old fashioned but I have always believed that women are the civilizing influence on society, at least as far as the masses are concerned.  Most men are concerned with making a living, women with making a home.  But I suppose if the men have no interest in supporting their woman and children then why should the woman be concerned with making a home for their children?  Or is it a case of the woman not wanting to make a home and therefore the men have nothing to support?  Or is it just a case that these people are so unlike the rest of us?</p>
<p>My grandmother always said &ldquo;water always runs down hill&rdquo; when referring to whites who pick up black habits.  I fear our entire society is de-evolving to their level.  Civilization requires hard work to keep the water flowing up hill.  I do not think we are up to it anymore.<br/>

		<p>Apparently they&rsquo;re doing quite well accomplishing that task without adding it to the curriculum. In fact, they&rsquo;ve learned that much better than they do what is IN the curriculum.</p>

<p>Very true. Most of these babies they dump will be black or hispanic. WE have had quite a few of &#8220;hispanic&#8221; babies dumped in trash cans or killed.  </p>
<p>Have no fear though some do-gooder White woman will adopt them and raise it as their own. NEVER hear of any mexican or black adopting any of their own kind. </p>
<p> There is a huge demand for White babies, but very few to be adopted.</p>

		<p>Black children comprise 15% of U.S. population, yet 42% of the children in foster care or awaiting adoption.  Compare that to black adults who make up 13% of U.S. population, yet 48% of prison population.  The numbers are eerily similar.  This is a hallmark of the black mentality.  No amount of &#8220;instruction&#8221; will dissuade these ignorant black women from disposing of their infants however they see fit.  Neither can you persuade them to use birth control.  They are a product of their upbringing and there is not much we Whites can do to get through their thick skulls.</p>

		<p>I have no problem with human population control.  As far as these babies are concerned, well, they wouldn&rsquo;t have made very good people, and certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have contributed any more to US society than their parents have done.  Hunters kill worthier specimens than these every fall, quite frankly.</p>
<p>Poster 11 - White babies are high in demand?  From what I&rsquo;ve seen of adoption stories, potential adopters seem to assume that there&rsquo;s a problem with White babies, that if their mom doesn&rsquo;t want them, then they must be retarded or FAS/crack babies or something, so that&rsquo;s why they run to Africa to get &#8220;pure, healthy&#8221; kids or some dumb crapola.</p>
