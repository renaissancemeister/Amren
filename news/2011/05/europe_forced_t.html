			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruno Waterfield, Telegraph (London), May 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Passport-free travel across the &#8220;Schengen&#8221; area, which does not include Britain or Ireland, has come under unprecedented pressure after Italy last month gave residence permits to over 25,000 Arab migrants allowing them unfettered access to rest of the EU.</p>
<p>France, the likely destination of the mainly French-speaking Tunisian immigrants, responded by temporarily closing a key railway frontier with Italy and by introducing tough extra checks for papers on immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be necessary to foresee the temporary reintroduction of limited internal border controls under very exceptional circumstances,&#8221; said Cecilia Malmstroem, the EU&rsquo;s internal affairs commissioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The European Commission feels it should be a community mechanism not unilateral and there should be very clear conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Swedish commissioner insisted that even though border controls might be temporarily coming back to deal with a wave of immigrants from North Africa, it would not become the norm over the next few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The free movement of people across European borders is a major achievement which must not be reversed,&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>The proposals will be submitted to an emergency meeting of EU interior ministers on May 12 before what are expected to be bad tempered discussions on immigration between European leaders at a Brussels summit on June 24.</p>
<p>EU governments are unlikely to agree to the commission&rsquo;s rethink because it will give Brussels the power to decide which circumstances are &#8220;exceptional&#8221;, removing the decision to reintroduce border controls from national capitals.</p>
<p>The proposals suggest that the EU should step in &#8220;to handle situations where either a member state is not fulfilling its obligations to control its section of the external border, or where a particular portion of the external border comes under unexpected and heavy pressure due to external events&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing exceptional events across the Mediterranean,&#8221; said the commissioner.</p>
<p>But Mrs Malmstroem on Wednesday refused to say whether the influx of Arabs into Italy, following political unrest in Tunisia and Libya, would trigger special measures.</p>
<p>The police in Norway, a member of the Schengen zone even though it is not an EU member, on Wednesday complained that passport-free travel had led to a crime wave in Nordic countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open borders in Europe have led to a situation where 80 per cent of crimes committed in Norway and other Nordic states are carried out by criminals who are either from the Baltic states or are strongly linked to the organised crime in the Baltic states,&#8221; said Egil Haaland, the president of the Norwegian police association.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open borders have become a big problem for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>If blaming the Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians will keep hordes of black Africans, Middle Easterners and Asians out of the Nordic Nations, go for it! When I was last in Sweden, some police officers I met at Arlanda Airport came right out and told me that there have been more problems from the opening of borders than benefits. </p>

No, no, no!   I&rsquo;m sure this is a misquote or a mistranslation. <br/>
He obviously means the BALKAN states. (e.i. Bosnia, Albania)</p>

		<p>Estonia actually had a very high homicide after the iron curtain fell, so he may mean Baltic states and not Balkan.T  hough,I always thought most of the crime attributed to them was of the organized variety and not the classic &#8220;wilding&#8221; that we are familiar with.</p>

		<p>I think he probably does mean Baltic states, but these criminals he is referring to are mostly ethnic Russians.  The reference to &#8220;organised crime&#8221; (Russian mafia) suggests that.</p>

<i><b>Pope Urges Welcome for Immigrants</b></i></p>

Despite Amren&rsquo;s ban on criticism of the &#8220;traditional religions of the West&#8221;, what can one say?  </p>
<p>Christianity which was for centuries the bulwark of Europe, has turned against it and become its enemy! <i>Our </i>enemy.</p>
<p>The church no longer speaks for us. It is any wonder that I am an ex-Catholic with no plans to return?</p>
<p>Let the foolish Pope look to Africa and the Muslims for his future supporters. And good luck! He&rsquo;ll need it.</p>

<p>The Pope has no control over immigration, the European governments do.  What would you have him do as a Christian?  Go into a tirade over all the colored masses overwhelming Europe? Christians are commanded to prosthelytize the world by bringing people to Christ.  I don&rsquo;t think they would be very receptive to the message if he went nativist on them.  Europe&rsquo;s woes are caused by a lack of Christianity and the rise of militant feminism, homosexuality and moral relativism.  Alot of people like to blame Christianity for the decline of Western Civilization but there is an undeniable truth that the West was stronger when people adhered to their faith.    </p>

<p> <i>Of course they do.  But if the pope he has no control over it, then perhaps he should stay out of it.</i> </p>
<p><i>(Nonetheless, the pope still has a lot of influence, if not control.)</i></p>
<p> What would you have him do as a Christian? Go into a tirade over all the colored masses overwhelming Europe? Christians are commanded to prosthelytize the world by bringing people to Christ.</p>
<p>  <i>Who said anything about  tirades  (except you)?  How about saying nothing at all?  Perhaps he could start by just shutting his mouth and sticking to  religion, not immigration.</i>  </p>
<p>Christians are commanded to prosthelytize the world by bringing people to Christ.   &mdash;  </p>
<p><i>That doesn&rsquo;t mean bringing them INTO your countries. It used to mean bringing Christ to THEM, not bringing them  to you.</i></p>
<p>PS - So you favor giving a hearty welcome to the world&rsquo;s teeming non-white masses, do you?  How did you find your way onto Amren?</p>
<p>And do you REALLY think you&rsquo;re bringing these Muslims to Christ? Get real.  I&rsquo;ve rarely seen a more ridiculous post than yours.</p>
