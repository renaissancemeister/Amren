			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WWJ-TV (Detroit), May 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to a new report, 47 percent of Detroiters are &#8220;functionally illiterate.&#8221; The alarming new statistics were released by the Detroit Regional Workforce Fund on Wednesday.</p>
<p>WWJ Newsradio 950 spoke with the Fund&rsquo;s Director, Karen Tyler-Ruiz, who explained exactly what this means.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not able to fill out basic forms, for getting a job  &mdash;  those types of basic everyday (things). Reading a prescription; what&rsquo;s on the bottle, how many you should take .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just your basic everyday tasks,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the Detroit suburbs also have high numbers of functionally illiterate: 34 percent in Pontiac and 24 percent in Southfield. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report will be used to provide better training for local workers.<br/>

		<p>This is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>Failure of blacks to assimilate into White culture allows for White Humanity to study them in their natural expression of identity and worth.  A thing defines itself by how it acts.</p>
<p>And for every illiterate black, you don&rsquo;t have a train of suffering and diminished White teachers who sacrifices their lives, limbs, and souls for the uplift of an impossible people.</p>
<p>Whites cannot raise blacks by a degree of one without ourselves being pulled down by ten.</p>
<p>The failure of blacks in Detroit may serve as a warning to do gooder White teachers that if blacks haven&rsquo;t by now taken advantage of all the free stuff we&rsquo;ve given them in hopes that they would all become English lords and ladies instead of typical Africans, they never will do anything but dismay us.</p>
<p>Wake up Whitey:  STOP TRYING TO FORCE BLACKS TO ACT WHITE!</p>
<p>Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and other forms are of higher civilization should be walled off and segregated for WHITES ONLY!</p>
<p>Next time you hear a black complaining about something we did or didn&rsquo;t do, demand that they speak to you in their native tongue, not the one they learned from the White &#8220;Massa.&#8221;<br/>

<p>If someone hasn&rsquo;t learned to read after more than a decade in full-time education, they will never learn anything beyond scrubbing toilets.  Whatever &#8220;workforce training program&#8221; this study inspires will be a total waste of tax money.<br/>

		<p>This is just pathetic reading a report like this in 2011. I&rsquo;m sure there will be calls for more money to fix the problem, however it didn&rsquo;t cost me a dime to teach my children their abc&rsquo;s, and both could read cat in the hat before kindergarten.</p>

Speaking of reading, I&rsquo;m lookinig forward to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s new book White Identity. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have my hands on it by the first of the week, depending on shipping. </p>

<p>We cannot uplift black people no matter what we do. We never could, we can&rsquo;t now, and we never will. What we should do is separate whites from blacks and let the blacks conduct themselves as they see fit. They do what they do, and that is that.</p>

		<p>30 years of Great Society entitlements and inner city African IQs are probably right back where they started in Africa.  Maybe worse because African blacks would not expect to continue what they have and thus at least have the potential positive attitude to endure change.</p>
<p>And as the secondary percentages show, once down, they stay down so that vouchering them out (away from each other) to the &#8216;burbs does nothing either because the entitlements simply get richer to afford the lifestyle.</p>
<p>The suburbanization of ghetto blacks is thus a setup to white disaster for no appreciable benefit to either side, like a contagion spread by random dispersal.</p>
<p>It is as though they were just released from chains yesterday and must start all over again.</p>
<p>So much for Flynn.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d have thought it was more like 80% were functionally illiterate. It&rsquo;s not so bad after all. What&rsquo;s the real purpose of this &#8220;report&#8221;? Most likely it&rsquo;s just to coax more money out of the government for yet another program to address some so-called problem.</p>

<p>Last summer, NBC&rsquo;s Dateline show had a special about Detroit.  Chris Hansen, the normal host of Dateline, just happens to be a Detroit area native.  Toward the end of the show, the feely-good section where they pretended that Detroit&rsquo;s problems are somehow reparable without mentioning the obvious taboo, they showed film of Hansen&rsquo;s high school alma mater (Brother Rice, in the suburbs), its current students doing their mandated volunteer projects tutoring slow black middle and high school students in math and other subjects.</p>
<p>Instead of using that time to advance their own math skills, they&rsquo;re essentially spinning their wheels and going backwards by a matter of inches in order bring forward black students who are far further behind perhaps a little bit.</p>

		<p>Over 50% of Detroit Africans can read.  This is great news, and it shows that the trillions of dollars we&rsquo;ve spent on Africans living in the USA has paid off.  50% literacy is much, much  better than in many places in Africa, where literacy can drop as low as 5%.  In comparison to most Africans, those living in the USA are doing fantastic.  The USA needs to congratulate itself for a job well done. </p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, Southfield is:</p>
<p><i>The racial makeup of the city was 54.22% African American, 38.83% White, 3.09% Asian, 0.20% Native American, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.64% from other races, and 2.99% from two or more races. 1.19% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.</i></p>
<p>And Pontiac:</p>
<p><i>The racial makeup of the city was 39.09% White, 47.92% African American, 0.58% Native American, 2.40% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 6.47% from other races, and 3.50% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 12.76% of the population.</i></p>

		<p>That anyone is surprised at this statistic is surprising to me. Anyone shocked at this statistic is feigning shock or is living in a hole in the ground! </p>
<p>During the early 1970&rsquo;s I taught in a predominantly black school district for several years. I left teaching in disgust. I knew then that all of the money that we were pouring into education for these people was a waste. </p>
<p>There was a constant threat of some &#8220;reverend&#8221; and his followers marching on the school to have any white teacher raked over the coals if they dared to discipline a black child. The white teachers, many of them old and tired, could not begin to handle the constant nonsense and indiscipline of the wild black children who came to school with an attitude that whites owed them something. </p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me that we feel &#8220;shock&#8221; at the antics of a group of people who are taught to hate and defy us from the time they are babies. Our President&rsquo;s experience with &#8220;Reverend&#8221; Wright, is a good example of what most of them hear during their entire growing up years.</p>
<p>Worse for them though is their contempt for learning. Most of them believe that learining is &#8220;acting white&#8221;. Most don&rsquo;t realize that learing is the only tool they will ever have to make them come out on top. They are destroying themselves&hellip;and we, their fellow countrymen, along with them.</p>

		<p>For heavens&rsquo; sake, I was reading complete novels by the time I was perhaps eight or nine years old! Blacks should be ashamed of themselves. We all know(or should know)the racial limitations in IQ, etc., but there is NO EXCUSE in this day and age not to be able to read or write at the most basic level. </p>
<p>Of course, none here are remotely surprised by this article - indeed, I&rsquo;ll bet most of us suspect the number is, in fact, higher than 47%.  </p>

		<p>The ghettos are doomed to get even worse as they stew in their own juices.  Blacks with any intelligence at all got out years ago, and their offspring will not be returning to instill their genes.  White men, who used to go there for easy sex, can find it elsewhere now.  Only a few depraved, self-hating white women will find themselves linked with a ghetto man, and many of these take any resulting children back into the white world.  <br/>
The blacks of Detroit and like regions are in an evolutionary dead end.</p>

		<p>I did a little research and found some ASTOUNDING facts. Detroit schools have a budget of just over a billion dollars for 2011. With 74,000 students that comes to $13,500 per student.</p>
<p>Here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, we have three excellent private schools, one Catholic, one Protestant, and one secular college prep. These three schools spend an average of $4200 per student. Over 90% of their graduates go to college. Two of these schools compete with public schools in athletics and have won numerous state championships.</p>
<p>These schools spent less that one third per student of the amount Detroit spends and they get world class results.</p>
<p>What do you think makes the difference?</p>

This article describes how 4 billionaires spent ~ 4.5 Billion Dollars over the last decade trying to improve inner-city (i.e., African) academic performance.  The results?  Failure!</p>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!  Anyone here at AmRen could have predicted those results. Liberal do-gooders and muliculteroids (sounds like hemorrhoids) have been trying to close the achievement gap for 60 years now, and have not made a dent.  Not just in the USA, but in England, France, Sweden, South Africa, and anywhere else in the world where Africans and Europeans are compared, the gap persists.  In the USA, there are about 16,000 school districts, and in VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE, the Black-White gap remains. </p>
<p> These 4 billionaires are supposed to be geniuses, but they are infected with the &ldquo;Liberal Disease&rdquo; and cannot see reality when it stares them in the face.  </p>
<p>Different human races were separated for tens of thousands of years.  Each race evolved its own unique set of traits (its called diversity).   Some races are taller, some shorter, some are lactose-tolerant, some lactose-intolerant, some high-IQ, some low-IQ.  Sorry Bill Gates and Sam Walton, you can&rsquo;t fix genes – even with 4.5 Billion dollars.  You is whats you is n&rsquo; you aint whats you aint.    But, hey – it&rsquo;s your money.<br/>

		<p>Tom in Ill. (#19) wondered: <i>Since half of Detroiters can&rsquo;t read &hellip; how does the Detroit Newspaper still stay in business!?</i></p>
<p>In a word, barely (and there&rsquo;s two of them, thanks to a joint operating agreement). Recently they&rsquo;ve cut back on coverage area and days published in a last-ditch attempt to stay afloat. No doubt Mayor Bing and the publishers will demand a federal bailout right about <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north977.html" rel="nofollow">when the New York Times does so</a>.</p>

&#8220;Just so everyone can have a break from all the hard news, here is a parody Onion-style news story I wrote about Detroit last year: <a href="http://goo.gl/i5jLC" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/i5jLC&#8221;</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the most interesting article around.</p>

		<p><i>According to a new report, 47 percent of Detroiters are &ldquo;functionally illiterate.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Reading is more than just decoding words on a page; it involves an extraction of meaning from those words as well.  THIS is the point where those on the left side of the Bell Curve, i.e., blacks and Hispanics with average IQs of 85-90 are left behind.</p>
<p>But, what if the decoding process upon which reading is based is never, or cannot be reached no matter how much remediation is applied?</p>
<p>Charles Murray explains that poor/low readers, even when material is read to them, struggle with comprehension, vocabulary and meaning and have great difficulty following and then regurgitating what was just read to them   &mdash;   a symptom of low IQ rather than an indicator of poor education.</p>
<p>The problem is not that blacks can/cannot read or read poorly, it is the enforced educational/government-backed dogma that assumes that all the races are equal in every way and that a lack or inability to read reflects (name one or more):  poor schools, poor teachers, a lack of money, not understanding how blacks learn because reading primers are focused on how Whites learn, and, as always the stress of living in an oppressive, racist system that discriminates against blacks and browns.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p><br/>
No White child should <i>ever</i> be used to tutor blacks and hispanics during school time. If your White child is being used as a teacher in her class, you must put a stop to it immediately as I did when my daughter was &#8220;chosen&#8221; to tutor slow/low/non-readers.  She was told this was a great &#8220;honor&#8221; and that she should be proud of her ability to convey her talents onto those who needed to catch up, to help those less fortunate than her.</p>
<p>Gimme a Break!!  The teacher AND the principal both called me personally, more than once, for the first time ever, trying to &#8220;sweet-talk&#8221; me into giving permission for her to skip her own lessons in order to help &#8220;struggling readers&#8221; catch up to her level. Permission Denied!!</p>
<p>The only other time the school deigned to call me was when I held my daughter out for state testing.  The teacher called first to tell me she was holding up the entire class and wouldn&rsquo;t start the tests until my little daughter arrived.  Next call was from the principal and then the teacher again begging me to bring my daughter to school that day for state testing. </p>
<p>Funny how school administrators and teachers suddenly show so much interest in our White children around test time, isn&rsquo;t it?  Or to use as free tutors for the &#8220;slow learners?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the time they are wholly ignored.</p>
<p>Respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Poster #4 was wondering why there was a pic of a white woman in the article about detroit.  We all know that bait-and-switch stuff always goes on.  When it&rsquo;s a general article about crime or something, they always put a white person.</p>
<p>Around here on the east coast Target (the store) has started a new ad campaign for their pharmacy.  They have billboards all over the place with a smiling pharmacist in a white coat, ready to serve.  The three billboards I have seen have featured: an indopak woman, a chinese woman, and a black man.  (The last sign was all in spanish, go figure, and it was in a mostly non latino neighborhood.)  Target is becoming like McDonalds now - promoting 365 non-white.</p>
<p>To poster #15:  Remember, our gov counts arabs, some latinos, central asians, turks, etc as whites.  I have been to detroit many times.  There are a few old polish people, a few rich executives on up towards grosse pointe, and a few urban gentrifiers here and there, but altogether they can&rsquo;t be more than 3-4% of the population.  The other 6-8% are arabs, etc.</p>

<p> How right you are! This cheats the White kids out of THEIR learning time, and will be a waste of time - can&rsquo;t teach a rock to sing ya know! I&rsquo;ve known cases where the White kid had to bring the thug - oops - &#8220;yuf&#8221; HOME with him to tutor him after school! Soon the thug - damn, oops - &#8220;yuf&#8221; was bringing some of his &#8220;homies&#8221; over to the White guys house on the week-end to play &#8220;bassetball&#8221; in the driveway blaring hip-hop while sneering at the White neighbors. The White kid always looked uncomfortable with the situation but was probably too scared to say anything so he wouldn&rsquo;t appear &#8220;racisss&#8221;. Probably why his parents didn&rsquo;t say anything either. Anyway, it finally came to a stop after the police were called several times. Soon after, the White kids parents enrolled him in a White private school - quote - &#8220;for his own safety&#8221;.  All of this because of some liberal progessives &#8220;experiment&#8221;.</p>

As an adult, when I have taken a course in a computer language I have felt flattered when other students asked for my help. I have felt that by helping them understand various concepts I enhanced my own understanding of those concepts. I never felt competitive with the students I helped. I never felt that I looked better when they looked worse. <br/>
 <br/>
Different people learn best in different environments. A certain amount of academic competition is inevitable. Nevertheless, I have always learned best in an uncompetitive, unstructured environment requiring individual initiative.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was in the seventh grade my parents gave me a Gilbert chemistry set. I became fascinated with chemistry. During the next two years I performed all of the experiments, and read many books on chemistry on my own. Unfortunately, the course I took in chemistry in the twelfth grade killed my interest in the subject. Everything that I know about chemistry I remember from what I taught myself in the seventh and eighth grade. </p>

<p>John, adult ed is very different from high school ed.  You, and everyone else in adult school are there voluntarily.  You are not a disinterested teenager, especially one &#8220;of color&#8221; mandated to sit through classes that you don&rsquo;t have a prayer of understanding.</p>
<p><i>I have always learned best in an uncompetitive, unstructured environment requiring individual initiative.</i></p>
<p>It is a rare high school student who takes any initiative, individual or otherwise.</p>
<p>The world is competitive, to tell students it is not is to do them a disservice.    We compete for grades in college, we compete in the market place for jobs.</p>
<p>What I strongly object to is this:  An educational system that enforces the false dogma  that all races are equal in all ways; IQ is irrelevant, all children, no matter their race, have the exact same academic potential.  This is patently false, as you yourself know from reading Rushton, Lynn and Jensen.  Murray himself writes that IQ is set around age 10 with little variation throughout life.</p>
<p>I object to an educational system that believes academic tracking might hurt someone&rsquo;s fragile feelings so therefore all children must be placed in the same classroom regardless of ability   &mdash;   meaning those with IQs of 140 sit next to those with IQs of 85.  This is patently wrong and hurts children on both ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I object to my child&rsquo;s educational time sacrificed to help those of limited potential, limited IQ if you will.  Should not our brighter children be allowed to progress, to move forward instead of being held back, which tutoring others during class time  certainly does.</p>
<p><i>When I was in the seventh grade my parents gave me a Gilbert chemistry set. I became fascinated with chemistry&hellip;I remember from what I taught myself in the seventh and eighth grade</i></p>
<p>John to your great honor, you are an autodidact!</p>
<p>You, unlike the average high school student, are obviously highly intelligent and intensely curious as noted from your interest in human bio-diversity and racial differences.</p>
<p>And, you are certainly not a troll!</p>
<p>John:  I have many disagreements with you, often diametrically so, yet you have been nothing but civil in your responses to me, you have not launched personal attacks aimed at me or any others and for this I wish to applaud you. </p>

		<p>What does anyone expect of a group of people who are physically, mentally and intellectually lazy?  I go to school with some of these African-American academic wonders.  The first thing I always notice is their unwillingness to work hard for good grades, plus their never ending sense of entitlement.  What does anyone expect of a race in which over 50 percent of them drop out of high school to begin with.  True, people had to drop out during the Great Depression and World War Two as my mother had do for example, to help out her family.  But that was a different world.  Of course, blacks will continously blame us-hey that&rsquo;s par for the course.  I&rsquo;m really praying that one day more whites start to become race-realists so we don&rsquo;t have to keep throwing our money down this literal black hole.</p>
