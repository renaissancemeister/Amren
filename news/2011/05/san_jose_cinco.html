<h1>San Jose Cinco De Mayo Celebration Turns Violent</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>San Jose police say at least one person was stabbed and several others beaten up when Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the city turned violent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Assistant Police Chief Diane Urban says the windows of some businesses were also shattered, and officers and emergency crews had to break up crowds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say they had prepared for possible trouble this year by clearing Santa Clara Street, dispatching more than 100 special operations officers and implementing pedestrian diversions.<br>

		<p>There was an exceptionally large turn out for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in Buffalo. Public drinking, public urination, but no reports of violence. In fact, I don&rsquo;t ever remember a violent incident on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>There was one incident I witnessed on the metro. A group of whites were partying too loud. A group of Hispanics started screaming at them to shut up. The white group quieted down a bit but didn&rsquo;t shut up, shout back, or get into a brawl. The Hispanics left at the next stop cursing a blue streak. Had both groups been Hispanic, who know what the result would have been.</p>
<p>During daily commutes, blacks and Hispanics are the ones who shout their conversations across the trains and buses causing people to turn their heads. Outside of special events like St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, whites don&rsquo;t participate in this common form of obnoxious behavior and if they bring knives to these events (which I doubt), they aren&rsquo;t stabbing each other.<br>

		<p>A rather puny showing compared to what blacks do in similar gatherings.  But they ARE learning&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>They have the potential to be far more destructive than blacks if they bring their Zeta and MS13 tactics to bear.  At best, blacks work in packs or disorganized mobs.  Once the hispanics get their illegal alien mobs organized, watch out.  The resulting violence and destruction will be systematized, orchestrated, and much more effective than a black mob on the rampage.  </p>

		<p>Italian aren&rsquo;t loud, rude, and obnoxious?  Irish aren&rsquo;t violent when drunk?  Yeah right.  I agree blacks and Spanish are way worse, but let&rsquo;s not deceive ourselves.</p>

		<p>Fake holiday created by the beer companies to boost sales. They don&rsquo;t even celebrate it in Mexico, besides who hasn&rsquo;t beaten the French? The Mexicans in CA. have gotten very bold, arrogant and pushy. Videos like this only hope to waken Americans from their PC slumber. I hope everyone remembers videos like this come November 2012. Amnesty NO! Border control YES!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you be deceived or confused; neither Mexicans or South Americans are Spanish, they just usually speak the language.</p>
<p>Having lived and worked in Europe, I can report that all groups have folk festivals that are loud and even a bit rowdy.  The difference is that they are (up to recently, at least) always been part of the local cultures and therefore accepted and overall very safe.  On the other hand, it was very difficult to find a quiet camping site in Southern France in the summer of 1998; European youths are VERY loud, but strangely oblivious to any inconvenience they may inflict on others.  Even little old ladies will do this in a market.  Europeans will take a position directly in front of you, blocking your view with no comment.  Europeans seem to have learned to ignore others out of necessity.  I traveled Ireland extensively in 1988 and while many do drink to excess, I never saw a fight.  They will argue with you about anything at the drop of a hat, however.  But that is more a signal that you are accepted into their confidence than hated.  When an Irishman lets you buy a drink for him, you have a friend for keeps.  Americans make and break friendships over anything, but for Europeans, once you are their friend, they regard it as a permanent relationship, regardless of politics and occasional disagreements.  Different cultures, certainly.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t they always?  The only good thing about the Michael King and black history month celebrations are that they occur in the worst of the winter.  Even in California and Florida it is often cold and raining in January and February, so the possibility of riot and pillage is lessened.  </p>

		<p>I remember from living in Denver how the whole city was on edge every May 5. It was handled by the local media and police as an evening of impending doom more than a happy cultural celebration.    </p>

<p>How about who wasn&rsquo;t beaten by the French?  Sorry, but the French ended up conquering and occupying all of Mexico less than a year after the Battle of Puebla.  Just like the Knights Templar, Joan of Arc, Louis XIV as well as Napoleon&rsquo;s &#8220;Grande Armée&#8221; that conquered Europe, the French have fought many more battles and wars to defend their country than anybody else in Europe and in the Americas.  Any student of Western civilization would surely know that they have won way more than they have lost.  Educate yourselves instead of repeating the same MSM clichés.  Merci !</p>

		<p>Jeez, what a surprise huh?  Just like the riots and beer-bottle throwing and car-torching that we see all over white town on the Fourth of July, huh? Oh wait, we don&rsquo;t, do we?</p>
