		<p>I remember in night school how one  30 year old student did everything to fail, no homework, no reading and no showing up on test days. The teacher had a &#8220;special talk&#8221;  with the rest of the class on how she might have probelms we didn`t know about and not to judge her too harshly&hellip; I just said to myself, &#8220;Man she`s doing at thirty what I did at eighteen..&#8221;</p>

		<p>Oh, well, at least we&rsquo;ve thus far dodged the bullet of affirmative action airline pilots.  As we all know from the movie industry, in the medical, legal, and engineering professions blacks are now disproportionately represented.</p>

		<p>So UVA has a 41% acceptance rate for Black undergrad applicants.</p>
<p>I wonder if this might have some sort of a relationship with the problem with the Black perjurer UVA L-School grad this spring. </p>
<p>In passing, this chart is missing the rest of the story. As in four and five year graduation rates by ethnic demographics and the respective academic disciplines.</p>

		<p>You can be a mediocre black applicant and transfer from a community college into top ranked university while hundreds of deserving applicants are rejected. </p>

		<p>Well, 20% of those of Sub-Saharan African(African-American) origin, in the United States alone, EXCEED the White average IQ of 100(98 in the U.S.) That doesn&rsquo;t even include those who score at the average. So, it&rsquo;s only rational to assume that these millions of Blacks are going to attend college/university and many are going to attain degrees and many are going to go into high level, cognitively demanding professions. I&rsquo;m most certainly not failing to acknowledge the impact of &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; and the fact that tens of thousands of Blacks, who have no business in anyone&rsquo;s Ivory Tower, are getting accepted. I&rsquo;m simply saying that it is not intellectually honest to attribute all Black academic/economic success to anti-White Christian male American social policies.</p>
<p>Good night(or day), all.</p>

I wonder if SPORTS plays into this higher than average black acceptance rate?</p>
<p>I noticed our U of Michigan did not list stats.  They were sued for discrimination against whites, the university lost if I remember correctly, and Michigan VOTERS banned affirmative action in an election and the leftist are trying to over-turn it.</p>
<p>I keep calling for affirmative action in the NBA (when a white player makes a basket, it should count as about 7 points) but I can&rsquo;t get any traction!  We need to start a petition!  Or, perhaps a candle-light vigil.  Even if it is tounge in cheek, it makes a great point! </p>

		<p>  There is nothing preventing a university from accepting anyone into their program, regardless of their academic abilities.  But getting admitted is NOT the same as completing the coursework and graduating.  For a more honest and relevant understanding of Africans and higher education, let&rsquo;s see graduation rates and GPA&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>Affirmative action at its best. If admission to elite colleges correlated to IQ, one would expect an under representation of blacks vs whites of at least 1:6 which would add up to a total of about 2.5% black students. This assumes that only the top 20% of whites would qualify, vs. the top 3% of blacks, and does not even take into account other races with higher IQ. </p>

		<p>I was an undergrad at U. Va. when the first blacks (all two of them) were admitted there, about 1961.</p>
<p>Probably there were a few others admitted during the next few years I was there, but it must have been done quietly as I was unaware of it.</p>
<p>LIttle did we know and understand what was happening. After all, it was only two of them, right? Someone was pretty clever.</p>

		<p>The low black acceptance rate at UC Berkeley is ONLY due to California&rsquo;s Prop 209 which clearly delineates in Article I, Section 31 of the California Constitution, that race- and sex-based preferences and discrimination are outlawed in public education (including the UC system), public contracting and public employment.</p>
<p>After Prop 209 passed:</p>
<p><i>Immediately after Proposition 209 took effect the elite campuses admitted 40% fewer URM (under-represented minority) students.</i></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have that!!</p>
<p>Since then, the UCs have twisted themselves into knots to subvert Prop 209:</p>
<p><i>After Proposition 209 passed, the university more than quadrupled spending on outreach to $85 million. A university blueprint says the program is &#8216;open to all but, to the extent possible under the law, but should emphasize increases in under-represented racial and ethnic minority participation in postsecondary education.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>PLF reports: </p>
<p><i>Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t depend on California&rsquo;s public officials to defend this vital equal-rights guarantee in California&rsquo;s Constitution&hellip;The regents are trying to backpedal out of defending Prop. 209.  Geriatric Brown has already tried to sabotage Prop. 209 by sending a brief to the state Supreme Court calling it unconstitutional.</i></p>
<p>Result?</p>
<p><i>Victory! Court granted Defendant-Intervenors&rsquo; motion to dismiss BAMN&rsquo;s complaint on December 8, 2010. Plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit on January 7, 2011.</i></p>
<p>BAMN is the &#8220;Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>My daughter tells me that recently, during midterms at Berkeley, this group, most of whom did not look like students but rather old 60s subversives and pretend anarchists decided to stage (yet another) protest on campus, this time against rising tuition costs (as a side note, what do they care? most non-Whites/Asians pay little to no tuition anyway, it is taxpayers like ME who are hit full force with rising tuition costs, as there are few to no grants or scholarships for us Whites).</p>
<p>BAMN pulled the fire alarms in buildings about two hours into two and a half hour midterms instantly rendering the tests null and void as the students were required to file out of the buildings!!  My daughter said students who had just had their tests voided poured out of the buildings to confront the little terrorists right to their faces with pure unadulterated hatred and anger   &mdash;   screaming at them, telling them to get off the campus, that they weren&rsquo;t even students, they were sick of their antics and other things I cannot print here!  The &#8220;protesters&#8221; were SHOCKED that there was any resistance, especially from UC students.</p>
<p>Finally! White students are getting fed up with unequal treatment and discrimination   &mdash;   as they should since they are bearing the brunt of policies that explicitly discriminate against them in college admissions (along with being told by the dumbed-down educational system that they are responsible for ALL evil and poverty in the world).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the fighting spirit continues!  Although with California&rsquo;s current demographic situation, it is only a matter of time before Prop 209 is declared null and void.</p>

		<p>One of the first two blacks admitted to U. Va. when I was there (see above post) was an engineering student, and his grades were good enough that he was considered for election to an honorary engineering organization that I was a member of.</p>
<p>His election was opposed by other members in part because he had marched back and forth in front of the local movie theater with a placard (I was astounded to learn this&hellip;no one ever had done such a brazen thing in that place at that time!) protesting the segregation of blacks in the balcony of the theater. The member who raised the incident considered it to be &#8220;in poor taste.&#8221; I guess I was too unsocialized at the time to understand the sense of that objection, and I thought it was a ridiculous reason to oppose his election. But I understand the sense of the objection better now. (His election was vetoed principally on the grounds that he was just a sophomore).</p>
<p>At about that same time, the U. Va. chapter of another national student engineering organization I belonged to voted on whether the organization should admit women engineering students. I was astonished that there could even be any question about it, and I gave a little speech about keeping up with the Russians (a big concern in those days) who educated their women! Lol! With scarcely any discussion, admission of women was voted down overwhelmingly. I still think that was a mistake, but at least now I can see that there are reasonable (IMO) arguments against my own view.</p>
<p>Students were allowed to smoke in class at U.Va.in those days (late 50s, early 60s), which drove me nuts.</p>
<p>U. Va. had a simple student-run honor system: &#8220;Gentlemen don&rsquo;t lie, cheat, or steal.&#8221; (There were no undergrad women at that time). The system worked pretty well. You could put anything down anywhere, and it was there when you returned. </p>

		<p>Welcome to the vaunted new meritocratic America, where, at the most prestigious universities, the race with the lowest academic qualifications is accepted at the highest rate. </p>
<p>@ BlackRaceRealist</p>
<p>What you say is true, no doubt, but I think most people here realize as much. It is also true though, that blacks attending ivy league and comparable schools have similar sat/act scores to whites attending public flagship universities. </p>
