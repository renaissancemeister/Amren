			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jijo Jacob, International Business Times (New York), May 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that 22-year-old shooter Jared Lee Loughner, who killed six people and seriously wounded Congress woman Gabrielle Giffords, was mentally unfit to stand trial.</p>
<p>The ruling came after staff psychologist at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners and a forensic psychiatrist certified that the Arizona killer was not mentally stable.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even as the law takes its course there is no agreement on the motives that drove him to the shooting spree that killed 6 people and injured 13. There has been a robust debate over his motives, ideological affiliations and if he was politically motivated.</p>
<p>Loughner, who is held responsible for the killing of six people including a federal judge, is variously described as a right wing extremist, a mentally deranged killer, an anti-government fanatic, a white supremacist and as a die-hard leftist who adored Che Guevara.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Following are some key facts about Jared Lee Loughner:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MANIACAL LEFTIST OF RIGHT WING FANATIC?</p>
<p>Was he a leftist? His personal heroes include Venezuela&rsquo;s communist leader and arch enemy of the U.S. Hugo Chavez as well as iconic revolutionary Che Guevara. But it&rsquo;s much more complex than it looks  &mdash;  his list also includes President Barack Obama! Conversely, he could, in fact, be far from being a patriot as it&rsquo;s emerged that one of his videos shows a man burning a U.S. national flag. And then it should be clubbed with his inclusion of The Communist Manifesto among his favorite books.</p>
<p>All this could well be interpreted as his being a left winger! But Mark Potok, writing in Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), discounts this theory. &#8220;The main enemy of the Patriot movement is certainly the federal government. And so-called Patriots have certainly engaged in acts like burning the flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Potok says inferences can be made about his intellectual leanings from his reading list that includes books that run a theme of &#8220;individual versus the totalitarian state&#8221;. Some of his favorites were Ayn Rand&rsquo;s &#8216;We the Living&rsquo; and &#8216;Atlas Shrugged&rsquo; and George Orwell&rsquo;s &#8216;1984&rsquo; and &#8216;Animal Farm&rsquo; as well as Hitler&rsquo;s &#8216;Mein Kampf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There is also speculation over his possible allegiance to the American Renaissance ideology that espouses white supremacist ideals.  SPLC describes American Renaissance thus: &#8220;Founded by Jared Taylor in 1990, the New Century Foundation is a self-styled think tank that promotes pseudo-scientific studies and research that purport to show the inferiority of blacks to whites  &mdash;  although in hifalutin language that avoids open racial slurs and attempts to portray itself as serious scholarship.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh!  Like the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Except the Southern Poverty Law Center doesn&rsquo;t say Whites are inferior, The Southern Poverty Law Center just appears to hold Whites responsible for all the poverty, crime, drugs and every other negative thing suffered by every group under the sun - except Whites of course.  Whites are always responsible for themselves, their own problems and every other groups problems.  When Whites are the victims of non-Whites - which is almost always the case   &mdash;  - Dead Silence.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing Southern about the &#8220;Southern Poverty Law Center either.  They&rsquo;re not about poverty either.  They&rsquo;re all about demonizing, vilifying and destroying the White man   &mdash;   by the usual suspects. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Unfit to stand trial&#8221; means that he&rsquo;s going to the federal loony bin in Springfield until four or five different doctors pronounce him &#8220;cured&#8221;.  Since I doubt four or five head-shrinkers could agree on what restaurant to go out to for lunch, the smart money is that Loughner is going to be locked up for a very long time.  My suspicion also is that once he is pronounced cured, he&rsquo;ll face trial.  &#8220;Not guilty by reason of insanity&#8221; is NOT the same thing as &#8220;unfit for trial&#8221;, and the insanity defense has a success rate of only about 25%.</p>
<p>John Hinckley is still in St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s 20 days a month, 30 years after his assassination attempt.  Louchner killed six people, rather than Hinckley&rsquo;s zero.  He&rsquo;s not getting out.<br>

		<p>A crazy man who did a crazy thing in order to give himself eternal infamy acts crazy at a court hearing, and is therefore found incompetent to stand trial?  That&rsquo;s not news, that&rsquo;s an inevitability.</p>
<p>I am a bit suspicious, though.  Schizophrenia is a degenerate mental disease, and nutbar has been held at the Federal prison hospital in Springfield, Missouri, while the Federal correctional psychiatrists try to treat his condition.  I never knew schizophrenia could work that fast on a person   &mdash;   He&rsquo;s halfway functional in January but so demented in May that he&rsquo;s incompetent to stand trial, in spite of being on drugs in between.  He either has a form of schizo that is rapidly degenerative and untreatable, or he was faking his level of insanity in that Phoenix hearing, so that he doesn&rsquo;t wind up getting put in a real jail or prison.  The problem with my theory is that if he was faking it, the Feds&rsquo; doctors would have deduced that and testified to the contrary.  Then again, I might be giving too much credit to Federal prison psychs, because I&rsquo;ve seen one in action as a witness at a Federal hearing in the Tom Sell saga, and IMHO, this Federal psych committed perjury.</p>
<p>As for the part about there being a &#8220;debate&#8221; between the &#8220;links&#8221; between nutbar and AR, the problem is that, if my memory serves from reading the last article about that topic here at AR, if nothing has changed, Jared Taylor can&rsquo;t even get the apparent source of the notion that there was a link, some bureaucrat with some &#8220;fusion center&#8221; in Arizona, last name Dillinger (?), to tell him exactly how he and the fusion center came to conclude that there was a possible link.  We might not even know for sure that this Arizona fusion center was the genesis of this speculation   &mdash;   It might have started with HLS itself in D.C. As long as bureaucrats are giving Jared Taylor the runaround, never giving straight answers to straight questions, all anyone can do is speculate.  The best theory I can come up with is that nutbar&rsquo;s Youtube channel had side links to other &#8220;possibly related&#8221; YouTube videos (based on a Google-written algorithm), and the algorithm thought that an AR video that mentioned &#8220;Jared Taylor&#8221; could have been &#8220;possibly related&#8221; to any of nutbar&rsquo;s videos because three of four syllables of their names sound alike.</p>

		<p>Dear Leftists,</p>
<p>Your soulless and morally bankrupt religion produced Loughner. There is no getting around this. But rather than face the facts, you will continue to scream &#8220;racism&#8221;. May your hatred continue to be directed back on you.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;But Mark Potok,&hellip; discounts this theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Potok would discount gravity if it would somehow help further along the genocide of Whites.</p>
<p><br>
&#8221; &ldquo;The main enemy of the Patriot movement is certainly the federal government. And so-called Patriots have certainly engaged in acts like burning the flag.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet flag burning is often the only possible sign of true patriotism when a Republican is president. Funny how that works.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;However, Potok says inferences can be made about his intellectual leanings from his reading list that includes books that run a theme of &ldquo;individual versus the totalitarian state&rdquo;. Some of his favorites were Ayn Rand&rsquo;s &lsquo;We the Living&rsquo; and &lsquo;Atlas Shrugged&rsquo; and George Orwell&rsquo;s &lsquo;1984&rsquo; and &lsquo;Animal Farm&rsquo; as well as Hitler&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mein Kampf.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;Mein Kampf&rsquo; has got nothing to do with the individual over the state. Apparently having the faintest clue of what the hell you are talking about is not a requirement when your smear target is a White.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;There is also speculation over his possible allegiance to the American Renaissance ideology that espouses white supremacist ideals.&#8221;</p>
<p>No proof is offered. There is none. All that is important is to smear the Whites with an a priori assumption, then move on to the next religious edict. This is how leftists &#8220;think&#8221;, if you can call it that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8221; SPLC describes American Renaissance thus (sic): &#8220;</p>
<p>This White American describes the SPLC thusly: An anti-White hate organization dedicated to the ethnic cleansing of European Americans. They pretend &#8220;races&#8221; do not exist by appeals to emotion and legal threats rather than reviewing scientific data or facts.</p>

		<p>I think I remember reading somewhere that an acquaintance of his was interviewed and said that he listed &#8220;Mein Kamph&#8221; as  a favorite simply to annoy his mother, who is Jewish.  He probably has never read half the books listed on his profile. Obviously he is mentally ill and it was his illness, not his ideology that caused him to commit this crime. Media spin like this annoys me to no end.</p>

First we are told Loughner is so mentally deranged he cannot stand trial<br>
even in Arizona (where the insanity defense never works.)<br>
Then we are treated to a speculation about what philosophy motivated Loughner..clue insane people are not motivated<br>
by rational or even coherent thinking. Then after this stellar<br>
display of thinking this moron-journalist regurgitates<br>
SPLC propaganda as in depth analysis. </p>
<p>The only factual and solid fact about this is that Jared Loughner and Jared Taylor are both Jareds&hellip;and that proves<br>
uh..something.</p>

		<p>This familiar tactic just NEVER gets old for the mainstream-media. These are the same people who still try to link the Columbine shooters to Hitler, or Right-Wing ideology, or what have you - not matter how much evidence to the contrary surfaces. They are agenda driven at ALL times, and their agenda is quite clear.  </p>

		<p>If even the SPLC&rsquo;s Mark Potshot cannot bring himself to connect Amren with Loughner (the article&rsquo;s author does this), then it is safe to say that we need not fear the accusation. Of course that still leaves charges of &#8220;pseudo-science&#8221; and right-wing extremism.</p>

<p><br>
Notice how the writer says Loughner has POSSIBLE allegiance to AmRen. My guess is the writer and the splc are fully aware that there is zero connection between AmRen and Loughner, but want to get a dig in against AmRen and Mr Taylor. That and they want to make a connection with Loughner and ANY &#8220;right wing&#8221; organization, even though all the evidence points to him being a hardcore leftist. I guess writing an article using only the facts just doesn&rsquo;t jive with their political agenda.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say a consultation with a clear thinking lawyer would be in order. A lawsuit for defamation or liable, whichever would apply, might teach this social engineer and this extortion agency some manners. Besides it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to have the AmRen name in the headlines for months to come. </p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s amazing how the controlled media is desperate to falsely link Loughner to American Renaissance. There is absolutely no evidence for his being influenced by AR. His crime appears to be the result of mental instability rather than ideology. It also looks like &ldquo;our&rdquo; government is blocking Federal employees Internet access to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s new book: http://www.vdare.com/letters/tl_052611.htm</p>

		<p>The left-wing media tried their durnedest to tie Loughner to every far-right-fringe group on the planet, as well as to conservatively mainstream Republicans.  For weeks, MSNBC droned on and on, trying to link him to everyone from Hitler to Sarah Palin.  Like their preachments that any opposition to Obama reeks of racism and promotes it, such attempts are absurdist and probably believed by no one outside the loony left.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Potok says inferences can be made about his intellectual leanings from his reading list&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Potok is a public relations man. He has no legal or law enforcement background, and certainly no psychological experience, at least not as a practitioner.</p>
<p>Potok is compensated with more than $147,000 donor-dollars a year to find &#8220;hate,&#8221; specifically &#8220;right-wing hate,&#8221; behind every rock and tree. Last year his efforts helped to bring in more than $31 MILLION tax-free donor-dollars into the SPLC&rsquo;s coffers. For this, Potok received a $7,300 pay raise last year. (&#8220;Recession? What recession?&#8221;) <a href="http://wp.me/pCLYZ-7m" rel="nofollow">http://wp.me/pCLYZ-7m</a></p>
<p>Suffice it to say Mr. Potok has a substantial financial interest in promoting the threat of &#8220;hate groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;reading list&#8221; to which Mr. Potok alludes comes directly from Loughner&rsquo;s Youtube page, according to the Christian Science Monitor. Here it is in its entirety: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Classitup10" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/user/Classitup10</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Books:<br>
I had favorite books: Animal Farm, Brave New World, The Wizard Of OZ, Aesop Fables, The Odyssey, Alice Adventures Into Wonderland, Fahrenheit 451, Peter Pan, To Kill A Mockingbird, We The Living, Phantom Toll Booth, One Flew Over The Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest, Pulp,Through The Looking Glass, The Communist Manifesto, Siddhartha, The Old Man And The Sea, Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, Mein Kampf, The Republic, and Meno.&#8221;</p>
<p>The list may look eerily familiar to many current and former American high school students, as many of the titles on it are routinely assigned by English teachers, such as &#8220;Animal Farm,&#8221; &#8220;Brave New World,&#8221; &#8220;The Odyssey,&#8221; &#8220;Fahrenheit 451,&#8221;&#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird,&#8221; and Plato&rsquo;s &#8220;Republic,&#8221; and &#8220;Meno,&#8221; among several others.</p>
<p>(Orwell&rsquo;s &#8220;1984,&#8221; which does NOT appear on his Youtube list, was also required reading for most high school freshmen.)</p>
<p>If these are the readings of a mad man, then Jared Loughner has a lot of company in the world. More likely, the infamous &#8220;book list&#8221; is yet one more example of Mark Potok and the SPLC attempting to parlay the actions of a mentally ill individual into more &#8220;hate group&#8221; gold.</p>

		<p>#4 You cannot judge if a person is insane or not from images of him. Mentally deranged people can look perfectly normal, its not until you start to speak to them or see them do something that you notice that something is missing. Schizophrenia usually manifests itself in the late teens or early twenties and two schizophreniacs doesnt necessarily behave identically. </p>

 That is funny how that works isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
 I once read a book about Kent State U. where once a bunch of communists and anarchists buried a copy of the constitution because of the ROTC being on campus or something, and leftists would go around dressed as Fidel Castro. When a republican president burning the flag is patriotism when a democratic president it&rsquo;s &#8220;RACI$$&#8221;, it is always &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>

The only &#8220;inferences&#8221;   &mdash;   sensible ones, I mean, not wacky $PLC propaganda   &mdash;   that can be made about JLL&rsquo;s intellectual leanings or ideological positioning based on his reading list, are as follows:</p>
<p>1) His favorite books are all from among the titles that would have been assigned to him as a student; and </p>
<p>2) They are fairly typical of what&rsquo;s been read by any other halfway intelligent young person of his age; and </p>
<p>3) If there are &#8220;ideological contradictions&#8221; on this list (both Marx and Hitler; both the libertarian &#8220;We the Living&#8221; and the liberal &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221;, etc), that&rsquo;s only because JLL is but 21 yrs old, and hasn&rsquo;t yet had time to figure out that these ARE contradictions. They are merely books he&rsquo;s read that have for one reason or another impressed him (as well as millions of other people). That the &#8220;message&#8221; in some of these titles on the list is in direct conflict with the message of others, is not something that most 21-yr-olds are yet astute enough to notice (especially if they&rsquo;re mentally disturbed, needless to say!). </p>
