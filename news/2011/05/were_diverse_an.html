<h1>We&rsquo;re Diverse and Mission-Ready</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Missile Defense Agency, U.S. Department of Defense</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Standing at the forefront of one of the most technologically complex and challenging national defense programs is an exciting place to be. As the Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), my goal is to develop and implement initiatives that foster a highly skilled workforce that can help us accomplish our mission.</p>
<p>One of our biggest priorities is to recruit qualified applicants for positions across the engineering, science and acquisition management career fields. Competing successfully for technically qualified applicants in all career areas, at all proficiency levels  &mdash;  from entry  &mdash;  level to the most experienced  &mdash;  is fundamental to our recruitment and retention goals. Our mission depends on our ability to develop future leaders by ensuring they have the skills and competencies needed to excel.</p>
<p>Another priority at MDA is the diversity of our workforce. We approach it as a composite of individual characteristics, experiences and abilities that are consistent with the Agency&rsquo;s core values. Our inclusive workforce consists of a balanced cross-section of individuals working in various disciplines. Together, they enable us to advance all facets of our engineering and acquisition responsibilities. By ensuring that our recruitment philosophy complements our retention and development programs, we are able to maximize individual strengths and combine them for the collective good of our organization.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;d like to invite you to explore our programs for yourself. If you have the talent, skills and commitment to be a part of our team and share in the many planned accomplishments we intend to deliver, we look forward to bringing you on board. Take this opportunity to launch your career with MDA.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Patrick J. O&rsquo;Reilly<br>
Lieutenant General, US Army<br>
Director<br>
Missile Defense Agency</p>

		<p>Does anyone really believe that a majority non white military will ever have the will to fight victoriously against the black, brown, red, yellow coalition of races that will one day soon rise up en masse against White Humanity?</p>
<p>Why would non whites kill other non whites just so more Whites can keep our unearned White privilege?</p>
<p><br>
Who is the next Race Realist? That superior White warrior who was passed over for the job he earned so that a more deserving minority diversity can make the U.S. Military look &#8220;open, welcoming, tolerant, and inclusive,&#8221; or otherwise, &#8220;fully womanish&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t anyone told us about the valuable and enriching diversity that is represented in the &#8220;superior&#8221; Seal Team Six?</p>
<p>We predict that the military will break down along racial lines in times of critical chaos, just like your local police department will.</p>

		<p>Coming to Race Realism moment #3 unfolded in a military unit with high standards. Scenario: lone black mid-level member of unit is being sent to his next command on a regular rotation. Very rare to find black people who pass the hurdles to get to this position. Not a bad guy to have around, but did the minimum. The CO presents him with some letter of appreciation, which would be completely consistent or generous for his level of performance with anybody else in the unit.</p>
<p>But he deserves a medal, you see.</p>
<p>And after some heated closed door discussions with those at the top that were known to everybody, he gets his medal. And we all knew exactly why.</p>
<p>The military teaches many things. Servicemen, of course, won&rsquo;t learn them from the politically-appointed Lieutenant General Patrick J. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s of the world. Servicemen will learn them from their Five Senses, and their ability to process information.</p>

		<p>His butt kissing the politically correct higher ups to enhance his pitiful career is truly disgusting, and he is putting out nothing short of obviously propagandized drivel I&rsquo;m embarrased for him.</p>
<p>He knows full well that &#8220;diversity&#8221; means he&rsquo;s involved in social engineering and not his job.  What a total fool.</p>

		<p>Starting in the late fifties through the early seventies, we had something like 900 Nike-Hercules and BOMARC sites around the country that did a pretty fair job in intimidating the enemy, not least because of the 30KT warheads they carried.  High altitude bombers and fighter-sized cruise missiles though they were.</p>
<p>We did the same for a short while in the 70s against ballistic threats with the Sprint/Spartan &#8216;Safeguard&rsquo; sites near Minuteman silo complexes up in Montana, Missouri and North Dakota.</p>
<p>Safeguards whole purpose, after the arrival of the Soviet SSN-6 &#8216;Serb&rsquo; fast reaction, accurate, SLBM (Sub launched ballistic missile) was to keep the principle ICBM fields viable after a first strike from a sub just offshore beat back our perimeter warning systems and slammed shut the &#8216;15 minute alert&rsquo; reaction windows on the bombers.</p>
<p>This was important because while the BAS or Bomb Alarm System (nuclear flash detectors mounted on telephone and street light posts across America) and later DSP satellites could theoretically nucflash transition control of America&rsquo;s entire strategic arsenal to a Lieutenant General in the Looking Glass command post aircraft which was aloft 24:7; only the AN/DRC-8 ERCS (Emergency Radio Comms System, essentially microsatellites) on a few of the Project 494 Minutemen in these fixed-silo sites could give the go-codes which transitioned bombers across their target approach lines (ERCS may have also had a backup TACAMO mission for our subs too).  They had to survive so that we could viably blast to a Russia to self lighting parking lot and they wouldn&rsquo;t compromise &#8216;deterrence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Point Being: it&rsquo;s a lot easier to defend a hardened military point target like a buried silo cluster than it is to save the population of the United States which would be downwind-cooked from a &#8216;counterforce&rsquo; attack which avoided cities in a vain attempt to sterilize all our missiles and dispersed bombers &#8216;only&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Congress couldn&rsquo;t tell that truth to a Post-Vietnam America, in 1974.</p>
<p>With the current GMD (Ground Based Missile Defense), up in Alaska, protecting civilian area targets on the West Coast from the exact same threat is the stated mission.</p>
<p>Mission Impossible that is.</p>
<p>Hittile level, bullet to bullet, accuracy is not important when you can neutron-cook the electronics and probably mission kill the explosives (low order detonation of the explosives surrounding the physics package) of inbound weapons and it&rsquo;s interesting that the first &#8216;enhanced radiation&rsquo; (W66) or neutron weapons were in fact defensive.</p>
<p>With kinetic kill systems, you hit or you miss.  The closure rates are so phenomenal that there is no real way for a conventional warhead to be effective (the missile passes the target before the blast globe fully develops).  Only ER nukes work, assuredly.</p>
<p>Which is why the MDA is silly.  Being down to a few Ground Based Interceptors which are nearly the same size/cost as the ICBMs they are intended to counter.  GBIs trying for purely mechanical kills on ICBMs flying west from Korea or China are launched from sites in Alaska (i.e. a 3,000nm coverage zone with minutes worth of reshoot midcoursing) and have virtually no chance of success, IMO.</p>
<p>I give them about a .15-.17 SSKP due to the weak links between Navy Upper Tier (AEGIS radar on cruisers acting as midcourse target cuers) and ground command relays as well as known missile booster issues on kinematics and separation.</p>
<p>There are only about 10 such interceptors at Ft. Greeley which means if you fire half of them at one &#8216;mistaken launch&rsquo; threat missile, you might hit it.  Maybe.</p>
<p>Of course what we now know about the effects of upper air column nuclear detonations are also a lot scarier (30% ozone decrease over the entire northern hemisphere, just from a 50 warhead exchange between India and Pakistan).</p>
<p>But point blank:  If you can&rsquo;t catch the missile in boost/ascent transitional phases (i.e. before the ever faster SRB motors and early bussing scatter MARVing warheads/decoys on wildly diverse trajectories) from an in launch-theater forward location, you don&rsquo;t really stand much hope of killing it in midcourse.  Too low a booster energy.  Too few sites.  And too huge a ground track coverage expectation.</p>
<p>Yet more military efficiency in action.  Spending your tax dollars at maximum possible rates.</p>

		<p>Diversity is one of the most important aspects of the workforce at the CIA. It reflects the unique ways we vary as intelligence officers &mdash; our nationality, race, ethnicity, gender, age, language, culture, sexual orientation, education, values, beliefs, abilities, and disabilities. These assorted attributes provide us with a valuable resource of a variety of insights and ways of thinking. Diversity is vital to the completion of the mission of the CIA: protecting our national security interests.</p>

		<p>He had it right originally.  We DO need diversity  &mdash;  engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists, acquisition managers, strong leaders, etc. developing weapons in the military.  </p>
<p>When it comes to carrying out missions, skin color isn&rsquo;t as effective as a bunker busting ballistic cruise missile.</p>

		<p>I am a bit surprised by this.  For a long time, certain industries did not push for diversity/affirmative action.  Notably, the airlines and other technical fields.  It&rsquo;s like these people don&rsquo;t really believe their own nonsense.</p>
<p>I suppose if you tell a lie long enough and often enough, it becomes real.  To some.</p>

		<p>This is a good example of why I will discourage every young white person I know from joining the military.  My past several generations, from myself, my father and grandfathers all served in one branch or another.  Ive got records going back all the way to the American revolution.  It ends with me, I&rsquo;m only glad I got out after a few years and didn&rsquo;t &#8220;stick it out&#8221;.  Having a son, I feel sad that I can&rsquo;t approve of him joining up, if he should consider it.  I don&rsquo;t hate my country - the soil and my race, but I utterly detest what it has become.  They want diversity?  Fine, let them have it.  </p>

  As one United States general said, giving up diversity is too high a price to pay for the potential safety of our country. Diversity has been elevated to a national religion by our privileged elites, controlled media and government.</p>

<p>Many soldiers that engage in combat do not receive that award.</p>
<p>I saw more combat in Storm with a MOS of 55D than many many recipients ever saw.</p>
<p>The award became a giveaway with those two wars, basically an 11B on KP in a combat area receives one.</p>
<p>The award does not mean much anymore.</p>
<p>However, his rack of ribbons is pretty pathetic for someone with that much service time and high rank.</p>

<p>His silly salad does not stack up to mine, a veteran that served 8 years and was honorably discharged with a rank of SGT/E5.</p>

		<p>OK, we all know this is a bold-face lie. When America was 90 percent Native Born White American, America put twelve alpha-White Men on the moon by a Space Agency that was 99.9 percent.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s blathering&rsquo;s are in the realm of race-replacement treason and Chinese &#8220;American&#8221; military and technological espionage.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has basically declared war against the Native Born White American Majority. It is for this reason that I want to see the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget cut by 3/4. It would go a long way to defunding an institution that is now openly hostile to the Native Born White American Majority.</p>
