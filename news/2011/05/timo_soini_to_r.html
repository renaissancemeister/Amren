<h1>Timo Soini to Reprimand MP Hakkarainen Again for Racially Insensitive Remarks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helsingin Sanomat (Helsinki), May 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>True Finns party chairman Timo Soini is taking issue again with remarks made by the party&rsquo;s new MP Teuvo Hakkarainen on immigration issues.</p>
<p>The late-edition tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reported on Tuesday that Soini was angered by an interview that Hakkarainen gave to Jämsän Seutu, a local newspaper from the Central Finnish community of Jämsä.</p>
<p>In the interview, which was published on Monday, Hakkarainen complained that Helsinki&rsquo;s squares are full of idle &#8220;negro geezers&#8221; and that he feels that refugees should be sent to do forest work.</p>
<p>Hakkarainen also said that refugees who &#8220;shirk work&#8221; bring other problems to Finland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before long the regular population of Finland will have to run away from here when they bring their own Islamic laws here. They come from the Horn of Africa and bring their coarse customs here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soini said that the leadership of the True Finns Parliamentary group will have to consider measures to take against Hakkarainen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not approve of this kind of speech. That is quite clear&#8221;, Soini said to Ilta-Sanomat.</p>
<p>Hakkarainen&rsquo;s off-the-cuff remarks about immigration raised controversy already in April after a video interview with Helsingin Sanomat in which he spoke about &#8220;negro geezers&#8221; seeking asylum in Finland, and in which he made a mocking imitation of a Muslim call to prayer.</p>
<p>That interview brought him his first reprimand from Timo Soini. Hakkarainen attributed his colourful language to his rural background.<br>

<p>Posted in the thread yesterday from the &#8220;Gates of Vienna&#8221; blog.</p>
<p>Sounds to me like this True Finns party really has its act together.  Mr. Soini shouldn&rsquo;t worry so much   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s stuff like this why his party is now a major player in Finnish politics.</p>

		<p>For crying out loud, how could thousands of Somalians possibly be a benefit to Finland? Somalia is quite possibly the worst country in the world, yet these Finns think they will some how &#8220;enrich&#8221; Helsinki?</p>

		<p>If Finland were filled with just Finns along with some Swedes and Lapplanders they wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about insulting Muslims and blacks and whatever.  Open your home to everybody and everything, like a frat party, and nothing but trouble ensues.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how this oppression has reached every country of European heritage.  I was remarking recently about how unfunny most modern comedy is, and it dawned on me that so many subjects are now taboo that writers dare not touch on them.  It&rsquo;s still ok to make fun of whites, Christians, hillbillies, and fat (white) folks, of course.  So the recent prediction of an impending Rapture was grist for the mill, with one joke involving the failure of the great rising because too many people (i.e. Evangelicals) are too fat.  Comedians used to employ a lot of material about ethnic groups, subcultural types like gays, and man/woman conflicts.  Now, every phrase you utter may end your career.</p>

		<p>What if white people invaded Somalia, Mexico, Honduras, and all those Muslim countries, and demanded the same rights as the immigrants in our countries have? The &#8220;migrants&#8221; seem to not want their countries so since they are taking ours, so what if we took theirs?</p>

		<p>The words &#8216;coarse customs&#8221; to describe the behavior of africans, pakistanis, afghanis and arabs is a model of delicacy, restraint, and politiness compared to how I describe the custom and behavior of africans whereever they be.</p>

<p><i>Hakkarainen complained that Helsinkiâs squares are full of idle ânegro geezersâ and that he feels that refugees should be sent to do forest work. <br>

<p>___________________</p>
<p>These  &mdash;   uh   &mdash;   &#8220;refugees&#8221;  (ie.Somalis) come from cultures which have no tradition of work, absolutely no concept of any work ethic. There is no respect for work, and those who do work are held in contempt; as those who are rich and powerful live off the labor of those who are weak and poor.  Only the very lowest <br>
classes, and slaves, do work. Work is considered degrading. People work only if they HAVE to. </p>
<p>In the Islamic world, particularly Africa, unlike Europe, there is no virtue attached to work; it is shameful and degrading, something to be avoided by those who can.</p>
<p><i>âBefore long the (native) population of Finland will have to run away from here when they bring their own Islamic laws here. They come from the Horn of Africa and bring their coarse customs here.â</i></p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just speaking the truth?  What else can one say about people who sexually mutilate their daughters and marry them off at age 12?  What can one say about people who don&rsquo;t know how to use a toilet, and who ritually slaughter animals in the bathtub?</p>
<p>Frankly,  to call their customs &#8220;coarse&#8221; is putting it very mildly.</p>
