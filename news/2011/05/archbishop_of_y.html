			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Murray Wardrop, Telegraph (London), May 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dr John Sentamu, who has campaigned for the English patron saint&rsquo;s day to be made a public holiday, said people should mark the occasion with patriotic songs and real ale.</p>
<p>Although his efforts have so far been in vain, a diary clash with Holy Week saw the archbishop&rsquo;s prayers answered after the Church of England delayed celebrations until yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu said the English should not shy away from displays of patriotism, claiming it is only wrong if it becomes aggressive.</p>
<p>Leading a public sing-a-long of anthems including Rule Britannia and Land Of Hope And Glory in York yesterday, he said: &#8220;There is so much to love about England.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have long campaigned for us to have a special holiday where we can celebrate our patron saint and all that is great about our wonderful nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&rsquo;t we put aside one day a year where we can wave our English flag of St George, sing songs about our proud history and maybe even drink a pint of English real ale with our friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Patriotism is only wrong if you are not doing it in the name of the Crown and if you are doing it simply to run down another group.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Church of England and the Catholic Church in England moved their St George&rsquo;s Day celebrations by more than a week because the official date, April 23, this year landed on Holy Saturday  &mdash;  a day of suspense between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>York Minster yesterday honoured the patron saint by playing patriotic English songs on the cathedral&rsquo;s carillon bells.</p>
<p>More than 100 people joined the archbishop outside the cathedral for the celebration and to listen to Dr John Ridgeway-Wood, one of Britain&rsquo;s leading carillonneurs, ringing out the stirring anthems.</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Dr Sentamu said: &#8220;I think it is important that the Church pays St George his full dues with the sort of celebration not possible during Holy Week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the archbishop renewed calls for a St George&rsquo;s day Bank Holiday by writing to the Government.</p>
<p>Aside from his legendary status as a dragon-slayer, St George was, according to tradition, a Roman soldier from Syria Palaestina and a priest in the Guard of Diocletian, who is said to have been one of the most bloodthirsty of the Roman emperors.</p>
<p>He was venerated as a Christian martyr because he refused to renounce his faith in God and as a follower of Christ at a time when Christians were killed for their beliefs.</p>
<p>Sixty three per cent of people are in favour of celebrating St George&rsquo;s Day with a public holiday, a survey by ComRes has found.</p>

		<p>This man makes a lot more sense than the Archdhimmi, sorry, Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who wants to bring in Sharia law.   </p>
<p>White people in England would probably be called racist or Islamophobic if they called for more celebration of St. George&rsquo;s Day.   I&rsquo;m glad someone at least is speaking out.  </p>

		<p>Quote &#8220;The Church of England and the Catholic Church in England moved their St George&rsquo;s Day celebrations by more than a week because the official date, April 23, this year landed on Holy Saturday &mdash; a day of suspense between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.&#8221; So, I ask you, what better day to celebrate England?? Except they have it all wrong. Forget St. George, he&rsquo;s not English. Let&rsquo;s set the record straight once and for all.</p>

		<p>Dave-Uk, you ought to know better than any of us on the other side of the pond.  Tony Blair thought it would be cool to have a black archbishop.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Sentamu succeeded Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury so he can crown the next monarch.  Or better yet, since the C of E wants to ordain women bishops, how about a black lesbian archbishop? </p>

<p>Since the missionaries went all over the world trying to convert Africans, etc. to Christianity. They know not what they do.</p>
<p>Christianity used to be called a White man&rsquo;s religion, not a multiracial religion for a REASON. </p>
<p>The Word of God has been so diluted and deliberately mistranslated (verses/books omitted,verses/books implanted) thereby turning the real Christianity on it&rsquo;s heal. Will the blind ever SEE?</p>

		<p>Sentamu is really not a bad man - in fact he is vastly better than most of his white colleagues in the Church of England. I object unreservedly to mass immigration and multiculturalism, but I think it is quite unreasonable to pick quarrels with people who are essentially on our side solely on the grounds of their race. The sad fact of the matter is that most of the major villains in the piece are white. In the present climate it would actually be far easier for Dr Sentamu to sing from the PC hymn sheet; let&rsquo;s give credit where it&rsquo;s due.</p>

<p>Way too many Whites have already bought into just what you are espousing&hellip;WHITES will be demonized and racist if they are even allowed to speak any racial truths or defend their cultures and you know it. YES, IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH RACE! Until Whites get that through their thick skulls and stop this insanity of &#8220;praising nonwhites and denigrating their own, then expect to become NOTHING in your own lands! </p>
<p>Just look at how the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are now putting up Herman Cain as POTUS, because &#8220;he tells it like it is&#8221; and a White man has no such luxury. They are fools. I will never vote for a Republican again because I see how PC they have become and are leading us down the road to extinction.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s called taking a personal day with some friends.  If you have so little vacation days that you can&rsquo;t do this to celebrate St. George or &#8216;All England&rsquo; you are truly sheeple.</p>
<p>OTOH, if you have no England because a black archbishop is now your representative to god.  If you cannot make yourself take part in a government that tells you what you can say and think in complaining of their policies before you are automatically declared &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then maybe you have no country of your own.  And should look at why that is.</p>
<p>200,000 English leave England forever, every year&hellip;</p>
