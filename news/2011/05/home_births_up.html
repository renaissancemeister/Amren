			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>USA Today, May 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Home births rose 20% over four years, government figures show, reflecting what experts say is a small subculture among white women toward natural birth.</p>
<p>The increase was driven by white women  &mdash;  1 in 98 had their babies at home in 2008, the most recent year for which the statistics were available.</p>
<p>Fewer than 1% of U.S. births occur at home. But the proportion is clearly going up, {snip}.</p>
<p>The increase was driven by white women  &mdash;  1 in 98 had their babies at home in 2008, the most recent year for which the statistics were available.</p>
<p>Only about 1 in 357 black women give birth at home, and just 1 in 500 Hispanic women do.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&rsquo;s more of a natural birth subculture going on with white women  &mdash;  an interest in a low-intervention birth in a familiar setting,&#8221; said the lead author, Marian MacDorman of the CDC&rsquo;s National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The increase is notable because doctors groups have been increasingly vocal about opposing home births, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has for years warned against home births, arguing they can be unsafe, especially if the mother has high-risk medical conditions, if the attendant is inadequately trained or if there&rsquo;s no quick way to get mother and child to a hospital if something goes awry.</p>
<p>Doctor participation in home births declined by 38% from 2004 to 2008. The percentage of home births attended by certified midwives and nurse-midwives grew, meanwhile.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Exactly how unsafe home births are is a matter of medical controversy, with studies offering conflicting conclusions. And some argue that hospitals present their own dangers of infection and sometimes unnecessary medical interventions.</p>
<p>The CDC researchers did find that home births involving medical risks became less common from 2004 to 2008. Home births of infants born prematurely fell by 16%, so that by 2008 only 6% of all home births involved preterm births. That&rsquo;s less than half the percentage in hospitals.</p>

		<p>I have had friends who had home births but it was not really an option for me due to medical conditions and age. Even if this was not the case I would have not chosen home birth but I agree that it should be a choice if a woman and her family wants to take the chance. I will say that many women spiritualize having a home birth and make it some sort of religious issue when it really isnt. Also the often repeated statistic that home birth is &#8220;safer&#8221; than a hospital birth and cite statistics is another case of cherry picking situations. Most midwives that practice home birth will not take cases where poor outcomes are likely to occur. I personally chose a small community based hospital in the county north of mine where I knew that I would not run into minority or foreign doctors. There are other options for women who want a more natural setting but cant have a home birth such as free standing birth centers or hospital based birth centers.</p>

		<p>Feminist women one-up each other in &#8216;natural&rsquo; birthing.  Sara has a home birth with a midwife.  So Maggie has to have a water birth and no drugs.  Leading Serenity to deliver in a ditch, entirely alone.  Women throughout human (and perhaps even pre-human) history would have given anything to have a relatively safe and pain-free child birthing experience.  It takes some pretty backwards ideological indoctrination to think the more &#8216;natural&rsquo; it is, the better.  Who cares if little baby Hector has profound cerebral palsy due to birthing complications - he&rsquo;s so &#8216;natural!&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I have no proof for this other than my own observations, but I am sure a lot of white women, even these liberal, granola eating types are uncomfortable at the thought of being in a hospital pregnancy ward room literally surrounded by third worlders and their relatives.  There&rsquo;s that one white baby in the baby room, surrounded by black and brown babies.</p>

Well-Well, a rather interesting piece.<br>
 <br>
I&rsquo;d think the motivation for this trend hinges upon three basic points.  </p>
<p>  &mdash;  -The increasing cost of maternity stay. Caucasian people have always  been expected to have adequate insurance during their  stay since we are held to higher standards. Of course, those who are without insurance/underinsured, is now rather common. Despite this fact, it&rsquo;s still way tougher to get hospital administration to work with you if you aren&rsquo;t poor and aren&rsquo;t non- white,-that&rsquo;s just their mindset. Besides, middle class Caucasians don&rsquo;t usually like to subject their personal financial information anyway, to &#8220;ugly&#8221; and &#8220;humiliating&#8221; hospital means testing. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  -Impersonal, quasi- government and overly bureaucratic hospitals treat newborns and the parents almost as if they were registering an automobile. The only difference is, the DMV hospital administrator takes the parents and newborn&rsquo;s, highly personal information bedside. Drawing your baby&rsquo;s blood, testing it, then sending the sample to be permanently stored in a government database might not bode well with parents either. This has been standard maternity ward protocol for about 40 years now. </p>
<p>  &mdash;  -Thirdly, the probability of non-whites participating in the delivery, or hospital care of your baby! This might be the hidden biggie of all three.  Non-whites usually represent a significant percentage of hospital staff and support services. About the only way around this would be to have the baby in a small- rural area hospital (excluding southern, southwestern states), where non-white staff would be least represented. </p>

		<p>Anon #2 You said bluntly exactly what I was thinking! A lot of this whole home birth hoopla is just another way to show off! We have family in a very liberal enclave of Northern CA and we see cars with bumper stickers that say &#8220;my baby was born at home&#8221;. I always want to respond to them with &#8220;do you want a cookie?&#8221; when I see them and they are always hippy-dippy types. As someone who had a baby without medical insurance AND who did not qualify for medicaid I will say that most hospitals will work with you. The hospital I use has a deal for those in my situation- you paid 1950.00 upfront for a 24 hour stay, 2100.00 for 2 days and 3500.00 for a planned Csection. Of course your dr visits and any anesthesia were more but both of them were willing to work with us too. This is still a lot of money but when I got the itemized bill it was over 5000.00 so we got off lucky. This time I have medical insurance but I am sure we will be out 3000.00. I specifically chose my hospital so I would not have to deal with third world types- drs or patients. So far I have not seen one minority!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not like pregnancy is a &#8220;condition&#8221; that must be &#8220;treated.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s perfectly natural!</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the issue of &#8220;drive-through deliveries.&#8221;  Doctors convincing women to have a C-section to speed things along.  This happened to a friend of mine.  Her husband overheard the doctor talking about &#8220;tee-off time.&#8221;  She had been told that she was carrying a 12-pound baby and had to have a C-section.  Turns out she was shown someone else&rsquo;s ultrasound and her baby was 7 pounds!</p>
<p>Given what passes for modern medicine, I can&rsquo;t blame these women!</p>

		<p>To all those above who posted negative comments regarding giving birth at home, please step back a moment and ask yourself why you oppose the practice.  My wife and I chose to have our son at home.  We made this decision with careful consideration to many factors: complications of childbirth, hospital infection rates, comfort of mother and child, etc.  We wanted our son to be born healthy, happy, and free from hospital-born pathogens; don&rsquo;t criticize people for choosing to not have themselves and their children exposed to the deadly viruses and bacteria that the colored people have plagued unto America.  We had two white midwives attend the event.  Our birth experience was safe, wonderful, and unforgettable.  We wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for the world.   </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re full of it.  Until relatively recently there never was any painkilling drugs or procedures of any type for administering during childbirth. Peasants in Europe were so tough it is recorded that sometimes women had babies in the fields, then got up and went back to work.  I am 59 and my mother had me with no drugs, in a hospital.  It was due to her religious feelings and my father&rsquo;s family tradition as he was the son of a doctor and one himself.  My father said that he always knew which one in the maternity ward was his because we were the ones who were awake and didn&rsquo;t look dopey from the drugs their mothers had been administered during delivery.</p>
<p>Natural birthing returned NOT due to feminism, but a general return to more natural living.  If being a conservative means not gardening, dosing your babies with drugs before they&rsquo;re even born, and other general ignorance, then they are willfully handicapping themselves out of spite.  Maybe the hippies had got at least some things right.  Many of them were rejecting everything about the modern world and seemed to want to go back to the simpler, 19th century life of a small farmer.  I can&rsquo;t hate them for that, I think it is a good idea and likely how things will end up.<br>

		<p>I personally had two children in the hospital and one at home. The last one.  Nothing spiritual. <br>
I was born at home, everybody I knew was born at home. My whole town was born at home. In my school there was not a single special ed. kid.  We were all a very healthy bunch. Not a single retarded, autistic or handicapped child in a town of 1200.  Of course that was a while ago. <br>
My first suffered brain damage due to oxygen deprivation. The whole thing was a terrible experience.  Yeah, I got drugs, so did my baby.  My second was in a University hospital. Moaning and hollering women in the other cubicles, there you lie, laboring, every so often some nurse comes and sticks something into you or checks how far along you are, you have some kind of belt around you. I learned how to do it with my third. I was not ignorant and it was much easier, less pain, much less pain. the only regret I have is that I did not have more children. But I read MEN back then, and the Ehrlichs were pushing the population explosion concept and made you feel guilty for having children. .  Heck, the world needs more kids like mine. Those dang fools talking self righteously about limiting the number of children.  Whites are dying out already.  Let them tell the ones who have passels of kids that we get to pay to raise.  </p>

		<p>I think a growing number of white women feel uncomfortable giving birth and being in an extreme state of vulnerability among hordes of non-whites. Who can blame them for that? Our children are prey and targets to them, and giving birth out of sight of the non-white invaders is in my view a survival strategy.</p>

		<p>I was just relating my own experiences with people getting superior with me personally about my choice. I believe that where you have your baby is a personal choice and telling me that I am less of a woman for choosing a hospital is as out of line as me criticizing a home birth. Notice that I did not say that I did not say that ALL women having home births were showing off or spiritualizing the experience- if you got that idea then I am sorry. If you are healthy and have no complications then go for it! After years of infertility I did not want to take any risks.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t midwives have to pay absolutely horrendous insurance rates because of the potential problems?  I have been under the impression that the number of home births went into decline once the insurance rates went up.</p>

		<p>Natural drug free childbirth was a big deal in the late 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s when I had my children.  It truly worked for me.  The second child was actually pain free, just discomfort during the actual birth, that watermelon feeling.  The first child there was just 2 pains as the baby moved from the uterus to the birth canal.</p>
<p>So I in my naivette told everyone I knew that natural childbirth worked!!!  Try it!!!  They did and suffered tortures.  A few years later I went to nursing school and learned why natural no drug child birth worked for me and not for others.</p>
<p>First, although I am slim and not pear shaped, I have unusually wide apart hip bones, the classic heart child bearing hip bones.</p>
<p>Second, 15 years of ballet classes developed exttremely strong abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>But few women have that combination</p>

		<p>Until about 10 year ago the insurance companies were sending home babies and mothers born in California home as soon as they were stabilized, meaning that Mom&rsquo;s blood pressure and pulse were normal and baby was alive and breathing.  So some were sent home as little as 6 hours after birth.  The assembly then passed a law mandating 24 hour hospital stay.  That is not all that long for both Mother and baby.  I can see that since one has to go home so soon, why not just stay at home?  The trip is a lot of trouble for a 24 hour hospital stay.</p>
<p>Some hospitals charge $20.00 for the Father to drive right up to the hospital door to pick up the Mother and baby.  If they don&rsquo;t pay, the Mother has to walk up to the parking lot.</p>
<p>I doubt that home birthers object to their babies being delivered by the standard third world immigrants with very dubious credentials who staff our hospitals. They are all marxist anti White liberals  Given a choice they would probably pick a Bangledshi female with hepatitis and E coli with a fake MD to a White American male Dr with a real MD.</p>

		<p>2-Feminist women one-up each other in &lsquo;natural&rsquo; birthing. </p>
<p>I know a few women who have done home birthing. And it had nothing to do with one-up each other or being a super hero. It was a purely financial decision. Many health insurance policies do not include maternity riders. Or the maternity insurance option is so stupid expensive that people cannot afford to get the coverage.  You can work out payment plans with the hospital or have the baby at home for 20% of the cost. Simple math that carries a big risk. Maybe the real debate should be&hellip;.who pays the hospital bill when a woman in the country illegally has a baby? I doubt Mexican woman work out a payment plan with the hospital before walking out the door with the anchor baby. </p>

<p>Those pathogens are brought in by the third world non White Drs and nurses.  Heard of Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles supposedly one of the best hospitals in the country?</p>
<p>They had an Indian woman in the severely premature and defective new born nursery.  She was, like most Indian Drs in the US a dalit, formerly known as untouchable, with a &#8220;quota grade&#8221; aka affirmative action degree from some diploma mill Indian medical school for dalit quota students.  Given the corruption in India, she may not have even have gone through med school and internship, just purchased the degree.</p>
<p>Anyway, she killed at least 30 babies because she had active TB, Hepatitis C and several other diseases and never washed her hands after using the bathroom.  And she worked at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the country.</p>
<p>The nurses at Cedars don&rsquo;t even make a pretense of speaking English among themselves any more.  There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a White quota in any department, but the EEOC thinks it is just fine.</p>

		<p>I am amazed at the comments here that ascribe home births to snobism or other outlandish reasons. Of my five kids the last three were born at home and I wish I had done so with my first ones. Child birth is not a sickness but a very natural process in our lives. Why people feel the need to go to the hospital for that is beyond me. The danger of infections is certainly higher there than in the familiar surroundings at home with only germs present against which the baby has already acquired immunity through the mother while in the womb. And shouldn&rsquo;t be the moment of birth determined by the mother and the child, rather than the golf schedule of the doctor and with the help of drugs to &#8220;induce&#8221; birth, ready or not? The whole hospital birth process, along with the &#8220;medically necessary&#8221; circumcision of all baby boys, the ever increasing trend to caesarian intervention and the newfangled cosmetic surgery in the birth canal region of the mother, is a racket, through which the medical profession secures a steady customer base.<br>
To ascribe the trend to do what comes &#8220;naturally&#8221; - and at much lower cost at that - to snobbish elites, misses the mark wildly. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to go with costs too and add unwantd injections.</p>
<p>Smart Whites cut corners so that a healthy baby can have a college degree.</p>
<p>And of course there are a mandatory series of vaccines like Hep-C within 24hrs when mom is not a druggy or already diagnosed?  Please.</p>
<p>Sometime in the future, we will find that we have been dosed with drugs (lack of fluoride doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother European teeth) since the 1950s if not before.  Most of which are horrifically unnecessary and designed solely to keep us docile and depress the occurence rate of truly brilliant children (methylated mercury).</p>
<p>And there will be no vengeance because those who did it will be laughing at us, from their very rich graves.</p>
<p>That said, as whites age, you will see a lot more high risk, pre-eclampsic (sp.) and old-DNA (toxin saturated) related issues that would be better off with a real doctor and a trauma team on standby, for both mom and the kid.</p>

		<p>I had surgery on an injured wrist recently, and I&rsquo;ve got to say, I was not too impressed with the quality of medical care at the local hospital. The last time I stayed in a hospital for a couple of days was at age 16, when I injured my leg; that was 21 years ago, and if anything, I thought the level of cleanliness, care, competence of the staff and so forth, were a little better then. Yet the cost of the care has skyrocketed over the last couple of decades.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Home births of infants born prematurely fell by 16%, so that by 2008 only 6% of all home births involved preterm births. That&rsquo;s less than half the percentage in hospitals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this sentence implying that home birth midwives are better at estimating date of conception?  Premature delivery is higher at a hospital simply because that&rsquo;s where you go when you have complications during pregnancy.  Any number of pregnancy related complication can mandate an early delivery.  Why home births have any premature deliveries at all is the more important observation.</p>
<p>To clarify: why would any parent choose to have a premature baby at home?  Incredible if this is reason for the 6% rate.  I imagine the reason is a  combination of stupidity on the mother and father&rsquo;s part and cajoling (not wanting to lose face) by the know-it-all Dula/midwife, and misdating by the Dula/midwife.  Some of these parents forgo prenatal care all together.  Let&rsquo;s not jump for joy at this example of white liberal stupidity.  </p>

<p>The exagerated cost of hospital births and our illegal immigration issue have taken an unsound toll on white American&rsquo;s.                                                    Also, when you add the dwindling quality of doctors and their replacement by non-white doctors from the third world,sound and reasonable alternatives become appealing.<br>
Taking a course in emergency child birthing will show that the procedure, if done properly, isnt as complicated as doctors groups claim.<br>
Allowing our children to be born, for instance, in a 3 bedroom house with a picket fence will allow whites to become more distinct and proud of our capacity to be self-reliant.</p>

		<p>I agree- nobody would willingly give birth prematurely at home! Any complications would and should be sent immediatly to a hospital equipped to deal with the difficulties of a premature infant. Even the community hospital I use will transfer someone if they are in labor before 34 weeks because they do not have a NICU. My only problem with home births is when the parents refuse a hospital transfer or any medical treatment and they end up with a bad outcome or they judge someone who has made the decision based on personal reasons to have a hospital birth. Unfortunately the statistics on homebirths is skewed since midwives will only take those women they know will not have complications- everyone else goes to the hospital and any poor outcomes reflect on the hospital not the midwife. My suggestion would be to check statistics on deaths in childbirth up until about 1940 (when most everyone went to the hospital) and you will see what the real infant and mother death rate was. Again- I am not judging anyone for having a home birth but on the same hand I do not want to be judged for the decision I have made. </p>

		<p>At the time (1976) and place (Greeley, Colorado) where I had my first child, home birth was not an option, I had to fight with the hospital even to have my daughter &#8220;rooming-in&#8221; with me  &mdash;  they kept wanting to whisk her off to the nursery. I also got absolutely NO support whatsoever with my efforts to nurse her. The second time they brought her in, they said, &#8220;Baby might not want her bottle because we fed her earlier&#8221;&hellip;! <br>
I inquired about homebirthing a few years later (1982) when my second child was born, and it was available for some where we lived then, in Vancouver, WA, but with the medical complications I had with my daughter&rsquo;s birth (caused by the hospital) it wasn&rsquo;t an option for me, and a good thing as it transpired, because my son was delivered by emergency c-section. <br>
Given the state of hospitals now, if I were of childbearing age and in good health, there is no doubt in my mind I would go the home-birthing route. I would have been healthier and thank God my children (adults now) weren&rsquo;t adversely affected by their hospital births  &mdash;  only me. </p>

		<p>Well, both my children were born in the hospital by C-section, because they were both very large and I was told the first child might not pass through.  He might have died if I had a home birth, so I&rsquo;m glad I was in the hospital.  It was a good experience all in all on the part of the hospital.  I never opened my mouth once to scream, having been raised to not make a holy show of myself.  However, as I lay there stifling myself, I was treated to the sound of LaCucaracha on one side howling &#8220;Aaiiee&#8221; &#8220;Poppee&#8221; over and over and bouncing from one side to the other, removing the contraction monitor and oxygen cannula every two minutes, forcing the nurse to come in and put it all back.  On the other side was a lady from Haiti, also shouting frequently in her patois, interspersed with many words sounding like Oomba Boomba.  Her main goal was also to have the staff scurrying around her as much as possible.  I had my husband and mom with me, but both these ladies had parties of at least 6 people each.  I cannot even begin to get started on the behavior of their families, especially the young members.  The staff wouldn&rsquo;t dare to suggest any behavior modification for them, as it would risk charges of racism. It appears that one cannot go anywhere without this type of act from our Cultural Enrichers.  I understand not wanting to be around them, but I wouldn&rsquo;t risk my pregnancy over it by having a home birth.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And of course there are a mandatory series of vaccines like Hep-C within 24hrs when mom is not a druggy or already diagnosed? Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please, please do not fall for the liberal propaganda that vaccines cause autism and other problems  and are bad for the kids.  Most of the people that work for those anti vaccine foundations and issue those press releases are total anti White anti American liberals.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for it.  I</p>
<p> personally think that the rise in autism if it actually exists is caused by all this late Motherhood.  The &#8220;vaccines cause&#8221; grant hustlers claim that autism is also linked with high IQ.  I&rsquo;m willing to believe that, because high IQ women tend to go to school and build careers till their late thirties by which time there is a high risk of retardation, autism and other problems that cannot be solved by current medicine.</p>
<p>Get your babies vaccinated.  Do you want to go through the epidemic of the year routine?  Ask your grandmother about the first through 5th grade springtime epidemics.  Measles, mumps, chicken pox etc.  Every year one of those diseases swept the schools.</p>
<p>Our grandmothers often did not work and could spend 3 weeks every spring taking care of the sick children.  A White woman today who took off 3 weeks to take care of a sick child would be fired and replaced by a non white.</p>
<p>Then there are the diseases the liberals have brought into America by their beloved and favored  third world immigrants.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t believe the liberal propaganda about affirmative action, immigration, crime etc.  Why do you believe the liberal propaganda about childhood vaccines.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the liberal propaganda against childhood vaccines. </p>

I am a retired nurse practicioner and have a lot of medical problems.  I know from my own professional experience that the quality of medical care is goiing downhill because of these immigrant Drs and nurses.  There is a big problem of fraudulent credentials as well. Most of these Drs are unable to diagnose anything, including bone fractures.</p>
<p>I will not have any Dr. come near me, even for anesthesia who is not a White American.</p>

		<p>One factor that is critically missing from many of these comments is the EXPLOSION?EPIDEMIC of C=Sections in the US; some hospitals at the 50% rate! Absolutely unsatisfactory; most women can give birth normally but are hooked up to EFM machines continually which give many false positive readouts causing panic to ensue,stressing the mother needlessly and subjecting her to major surgery w/serious side effects that can develop. The old fashioned intermediate auscultation method that used to be used decades ago as the primary method of checking the baby and mother heart rate,etc is still superior and avoids unnecessary c-sections.(Confirmed in Medical Journals)The unnecessary pandemic of this major assault on women needs to be stopped</p>

		<p><i>The unnecessary pandemic of this major assault on women needs to be stopped.</i></p>
<p>Agreed, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Obstetricians fear lawsuits   &mdash;   and with good reason.  </p>
<p>You do not want the likes of John Edwards coming after you to fatten his war chest   &mdash;   parading around crippled, sick children in wheelchairs to garner sympathy from a hand-picked jury of mothers.</p>
<p>Said John:  &#8220;The only job I never quit was suing doctors!!&#8221; </p>
<p><i>One of his most noted victories was a $23 million settlement he got from a 1995 case  &mdash;  his last before joining the Senate  &mdash;  in which he sued the doctor, gynecological clinic, anesthesiologist and hospital involved in the birth of Bailey Griffin, who had cerebral palsy and other medical problems.</i></p>
<p><i>Linking complications during childbirth to cerebral palsy became a specialty for Mr. Edwards. In the courtroom, he was known to dramatize the events at birth by speaking to jurors as if he were the unborn baby, begging for help, begging to be let out of the womb.</i></p>
<p>No jury on earth is going to deny millions of dollars to such children who were &#8220;permanently maimed&#8221; with CP by &#8220;careless&#8221; obstetricians who could have prevented this disaster <i>if only they had given the mother a C-section instead.</i></p>
<p>The vast majority of cerebral palsy cases originate long before childbirth, according to a 2003 joint study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</p>
<p><i>It is not clear just how much Mr. Edwards made as a lawyer, but estimates based on a review of his lawsuit settlements and Senate records place his fortune at about $38 million.</i></p>
<p>This has driven up the number of C-section, also doctors&rsquo; insurance premiums.</p>
<p>I have nothing but utter contempt for John Edwards, for a number of very good reasons.</p>

<p>I second your notion 100%!  And I&rsquo;d also like to add that all Whites should mind their own health   &mdash;   keep yourself and loved ones as healthy as possible.</p>
<p>When/if 0bama care comes on-line, and it will sooner or later, we Whites will be treated like garbage by non-White medical staffs.  One of my relatives died last year of a MRSA infection caught INSIDE the hospital   &mdash;   the entire staff was non-White, as are most hospitals in S. California   &mdash;   that is, the hospitals that are still open, as many have closed due to having been overwhelmed by swarms of destitute, non -paying illegal immigrants.</p>
<p><i>Thanks to illegal immigration, California&rsquo;s overstretched health care system is on the verge of collapse.  Dozens of California hospitals and emergency rooms have shut down over the last decade because they could not afford to stay open after being endlessly swamped by illegal immigrants who were simply not able to pay for the services that they were receiving.  As a result, the remainder of the health care system in the state of California is now beyond overloaded.  This had led to brutally long waits, diverted ambulances and even unnecessary patient deaths.  Sadly, the state of California now ranks dead last out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people.</i></p>

<p>Keep an open mind on vaccinations and at least educate yourselves on their  efficacy.</p>

 Some of you need to take a deep breath and stop painting with such broad brushes. My wife and I have 8 children, six were born at home. We are far from liberal or SWPL yuppies. I have been in the WN movement since 1985. Granted, some of the couples we&rsquo;ve encountered at our midwife&rsquo;s home birth support group meetings were indeed leftists and such, but many were just good salt of the earth type folks who were trying to do what they considered to be the right thing. Save your venom for more worthy enemies.</p>
