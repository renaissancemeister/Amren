<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The population of the world, long expected to stabilize just above 9 billion in the middle of the century, will instead keep growing and may hit 10.1 billion by the year 2100, the United Nations projected in a report released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Growth in Africa remains so high that the population there could more than triple in this century, rising from today&rsquo;s one billion to 3.6 billion, the report said   &mdash;   a sobering forecast for a continent already struggling to provide food and water for its people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The United States is growing faster than many rich countries, largely because of high immigration and higher fertility among Hispanic immigrants. The new report projects that the United States population will rise from today&rsquo;s 311 million to 478 million by 2100.</p>

		<p>This high population growth in the third world and among third worlders in the first world is absolutely necessary in order for there to be 10 billion people on Earth in 2100.  The problem with that assumption is that third world population growth will eventually slow down and perhaps reverse, because the white societies on which they are dependent for food and health aid are declining in prosperity and power, partially because of it taking on the third world as a welfare client.  Killing the goose that laid the golden egg, for sure.</p>

		<p>The peoples least should be reproducing are producing the most and fastest.  And they all do expect whites to keep supporting and pandering to them.  Unfortunately, they themselves will not stop the mindless breeding.  Desperate situations will warrant drastic solutions in the future which mean mandatory birth control.  </p>

Will anyone dare suggest that Africa begin curbing births? No. Such a suggestion would be condemned as advocating genocide.</p>
<p>Disease, famine, and despots have done nothing to curtail exponential African population. Their misery will grow exponentially as well and these &#8216;population refuges&rsquo; will need to be relocated.<br>

		<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t take these numbers too seriously.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back in time to the dawn of the 20th century. If you asked someone from the year 1900 if he thought there would be two world wars that would claim the lives of over 100 million people, would he believe you? Or if you asked him if he thought there would be an illness that would claim the lives of 50 to 100 million people over the course of only two years (I&rsquo;m talking about the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic), would he believe you?</p>
<p>I remember when I woke up on Sept. 11, 2001 and saw the terrorist attack happening before my eyes on the news. Little did I know the day before that a significant event would happen that would change the course of the 21st century.</p>
<p>My point is that it&rsquo;s impossible to know the future. War and epidemics are an unfortunate part of humanity. That is why the UN&rsquo;s population projection can&rsquo;t be taken as 100% factual.</p>

		<p>This is of course the coffin, the last nail and the dirt burying the Western World, and the world itself:<br>
When I look at a third worlder, I sometimes think:<br>
&#8220;The Third World is the DEATH of the world&hellip;and there it goes, death on two legs. The mere presence of third worlders guarantees DEATH, even if it is through something as simple as over- breeding. They will breed as long as we give them seed corn to eat out of the bag. And it will kill us all.</p>
<p>It is eerie, the huge gap in knowledge and sane reasoning, between people who visit sites such as this, and those who consume pre-packaged mass media news. </p>
<p>And THAT fact is keeping the death of the world itself a looming danger. Because the MSM will never speak the truth. It&rsquo;s no good for business. Got to sell that last box of TIDE, or that last six pack of COKE, before the apocalypse.  Just one more dollar&hellip;</p>

		<p>If amnesty is ever passed, the &#8220;US&#8221;  population will go into a hyper-exponential growth stage. It would only take 25 years to reach a billion&hellip;within the borders of the &#8220;US&#8221;. The &#8220;US&#8221; population will not magically stop at a billion. There will be enormous demographic momentum built into the &#8220;US&#8221; population structure&hellip;the &#8220;US&#8221; population will continue to grow for decades&hellip;just like in China and India. Now the passage of amnesty, will result in a massive nonwhite voting block that will vote for unrestricted immigration to the &#8220;US&#8221;&hellip;effectively, the borders of &#8220;America&#8221; will be erased&hellip;.this is what will happen-with 100 percent certainty-when the current Native Born White Majority is reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;&hellip;high fertility nonwhites will completely control &#8220;US&#8221; immigration policy. Combine this with the fact that post-1965 non white population will continue to breed well over replacement level, and  over time-not too much time actually -&#8220;America&#8221; will experience ecological collapse&hellip;this will result in the collapse of the human population within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some people are pushing secession. I am all for secession if it means breaking away from the Republican-Democratic DC colossus and at the same shutting legal and illegal immigration down to 0 and the removal of millions of post-1965 nonwhites. But, I am opposed to the type of secession that tolerates the invasion of Native Born White American living space by high fertility post-1965 nonwhites&hellip;for this type of secession is indistinguishable from amnesty&hellip;and as I stated above, amnesty means hyper-exponential population growth within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;. The laws of physics-and the laws of societal collapse-make it  a complete certainty that the  White regions of the former &#8220;America&#8221; will  experience ecological and societal collapse. Anyone who does understand this obvious point is just ducking their head in the sand.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how legal immigration to the US (or elsewhere in the West) works, but I believe legal quotas are set based on the country of origin&rsquo;s population.  How many of those people in the booming third world are legally allowed to come to the US or elsewhere in the West?  How many will actually end up in the West?</p>

		<p>The growth is unsustainable.  Africa can&rsquo;t feed itself now, how are they going to triple in population?  Say goodbye to the Veldt, the Savannah and countless species of African wildlife.  America won&rsquo;t exist as it does now if Mexico annexes us to the tune of 100 million.    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often contended that long-range forecasts are worthless.  We&rsquo;ve been told that AIDS and several flu strains would become pandemics that would wipe out half of mankind.  For the first half of the 20th Century, Native Americans were said to be a vanishing people who would soon be extinct.  For decades, some have believed that American blacks were surging in numbers, yet they can&rsquo;t manage a leap fully from 12 to 13%.  </p>
<p>In my opinion, Africa is headed for doom.  Disease, famine, and wars are bound to wipe out millions when the West can no longer afford to prop it up or when some virus mutates into an uncontrollable pathogen.  Hispanics in America may become assimilated and stop having large families, and the government may become draconian about illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Who, in 1911, could have predicted what the world is like today?  </p>

		<p>A sobering forecast for a continent already struggling to provide food and water for its people.</p>
<p>Except that they don&rsquo;t.  Actually they don&rsquo;t &#8220;struggle&#8221; with anything.  The put forth some minimal effort with almost zero productivity while the white western world toils night and day to provide for them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cruel and unsustainable situation.  Imagine if say, a third world war were to break out (and lets face it&hellip;..Obama is acting like he wants nothing more).  Energy supplies would be restricted and, more importantly, shipping, especially shipping to that part of the world would be completely disrupted.</p>
<p>How long could the people in Africa hold on in the face of that.  Six months?  A year?  Probably far less.  The last world war, disruptions lasted at least 4 years.  In that time, most of the population of Africa could easily starve to death.  They are hanging on by a thread.</p>

		<p>This is a lot of stuff meant to lull us into a false sense of security.  There&rsquo;s 7 billion now.  Do you mean to tell me that with the way the 3rd World is multiplying and the way they&rsquo;re flooding into this country and other White countries that the population extrapolated at current rates is &#8220;only&#8221; going to be 10 billion in another century?

They will also classify them as &#8220;refugees&#8221; and bring them into the USA and Europe for us to deal with all their lives. </p>

		<p>There will be no shortage of organizations urging everyone to give these multiplying masses of more food, so they can increase their numbers without limit.  Bono is a a example of these kinds of morons.  The eventual cessation of population growth is a reality that mankind is not willing to face.  I pity the future generations.

		<p>What we have here is &#8220;dysgenics&#8221; on a global scale. The population will the lowest average IQ (black africans) boasts the highest fertility rate in the world while the two races with the smallest number of dimwhitted individuals (whites and Orientals) are having the fewest children. The truth is Africa has never been able to sustain a large population. But it wasn&rsquo;t until short sighted busy bodies started supplying the contienet with Western medicine and food that the natural balance of things became interurrpted.  </p>

Of course they conveniently left out &#8216;illegal&rsquo; before they mention &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; immigrants.

Any one with half of a brain knows why this economic collapse has been orchestrated.<br>
There is no doubt the UN wants a civil war in America. Then, at the bidding of the global elite, they will be able to come in with their forces like they did in Yugoslavia and finally take care of the armed  American  &#8216;nationalists&#8221; who are the only things standing in the way of the globalists ultimate dream. Their &#8216;One World Order&rsquo;. The pity is that Americans never took action against the global protagonists when they might have had a chance. Sorry to be there bearer of bad news.

		<p>This story is almost comical in a sick &amp; twisted way. Africa&rsquo;s population is expected to TRIPLE! Well if that doesn&rsquo;t tell you that sub-Saharans are not moral thinkers and socially aware of their dire and dubious existence, then NOTHING will convince you. In the most dysfunctional settings, on the most poor continent on the planet, in the most disease-riddled and crime-infested environs on Earth, they just want to keep having babies? That is truly sad. More orphans of the world. I can see the Europeans of two and three hundred years ago returning back to form. That is survival of the fittest. Now that the warmer climes have been long inhabited by all races, parts of extreme Northern Canada and Antarctica will be a haven for the White race. &#8220;Go North young man&#8221; will be the mantra for Caucasians&hellip; And sure to follow will be millions of 3rd worlders to offer disease, crime, unemployment, miscegenation and heartache the world over. </p>

		<p>The current USA per capita use of oil is about 55 barrels of oil/USA citizen/yr.  This oil goes toward fuel, heating, agricultural, food processing, and industrial production, power plants, plastics, fertilizers, etc.  Assuming no change in per capita use, the additional 170 million people in the USA by 2100 will require an additional 9,350,000,000 barrels of oil EACH AND EVERY YEAR, or a total of 26,000,000,000 barrels of oil per year for all the USA population.  And that&rsquo;s just the USA, not the entire world.</p>
<p>But oil is running out, and by 2100 there will be virtually no oil at any price.  Ask yourself: How will we grow, harvest, transport, process, package, refrigerate, and deliver the trillions of tons of food necessary to feed our 478 million USA population?  How will you commute to work in the giant 100-mile wide mega-cities of the future when there is no fuel?  How will we be able to pump in tens of millions of gallons of fresh water each day to LA or NY City, and likewise remove the millions of pounds of waste produced each day in these mega cities?  How will Chicago and Minneapolis heat homes and clear streets of snow? </p>
<p>The answer is, of course, we will NOT.  There will be no food in the stores.  No water will come out of the tap.  All gas stations will long be abandoned. There will be no work, because no one can get to work and besides, there is no electricity to run the machines, and no way to bring in the raw products or export the manufactured goods.  Roads, which require oil-based asphalt, will have crumbled away.</p>
<p> Folks, there is a great storm coming. It will hit faster than anyone realized.  Prepare.<br>

<p>I agree with you. I remember in the 1950&rsquo;s reading the magazines in the Sunday newspapers. The cities of the future were going to having moving sidewalks and little flying vehicles instead of cars. The buildings would have beautiful spires and be be oh, so clean, and civilized. The illustrations showed well dressed White people going about their business. The women wore dresses and hats, the men were in suits and ties.</p>

Also deport all the Africans and that means the descendants of the slaves.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The population of the world, long expected to stabilize just above 9 billion in the middle of the century, will instead keep growing and may hit 10.1 billion by the year 2100, the United Nations projected in a report released Tuesday.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
First, since when has anyone put any stock in the UN&rsquo;s ability to accurately predict the future?? Second, the african population is indeed on the rise. But the White population is in decline. And since the african population is dependent on the White population for food, among other necessities, it would seem highly unlikely that the african population can keep climbing to the moon unabated. Disease and especially starvation would have to eventually come into play. Add to this the unknown. Who knows what new technological advances, plagues, environmental catastrophes, natural disasters, etc, are in our planet&rsquo;s future?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the un has as much chance at accurately predicting future population projections as I do of picking the Super Bowl winner of 2020.   <br>

		<p>It seems that nature has made the black African women a rampant baby producing machine. As Africa progresses along its tripling of population you can bet the sucker softhearted West will be asked to support them with ever increasing billions of dollars of aid. Unfortunately, Sub-Saharan Africa is a stinking, ever corrupt, hopeless welfare sub-continent that needs to be left to take care of itself in spite of all the starving baby photos certain to be shown. We just can&rsquo;t feed them, and the more we try the faster the population growth of even more starving people.</p>

		<p>In discussing the population bomb that is Africa look no further than the little africanized island nation of Haiti.  With a population composed of the blackest and poorest people in the world, Haiti cannot support itself as it is a human lab rat experiment. Waiting for their feeding, the human-rats multiply, crawling all over each other and exhibiting demented and violent behaviors.  As there are too many rats that can be supported on their real estate, many have left the experiment and have arrived on American shores.  Locally despised by all, even by African-Americans, these illegals have spread like a disease from S Fl to the rest of Fl and to the surrounding states.</p>
<p>It is supreme irony that the Florida State Health Labs detected the disease AIDS in the middle 1970s prior to it being recognized by science.  And from whence this lethal bug came?  Why from the haitian lab rats.</p>

		<p>Whether the &#8216;White west&rsquo; will survive or not will be determined in the next decade or two.We are living in the crucial period right now - only the vast majority of Whites either do not care or are ignorant of the fact.<br>
  It is the immigration policies of the White nations in the coming decades that are the deciding factor.Time is rapidly running out, nothing short of a complete and vigorously enforced permanent moratorium (with absolutely no exceptions whatsoever) will do.Repatriation of existing third-world derived populations must be very seriously considered.<br>
 Tough as it might seem, to ensure White, western survival we have to be absolutely ruthless and deaf, dumb and blind to any vestige of human pity.Boatloads full of starving, human skeletons from Africa (make no mistake this WILL happen) must either be turned back or sunk.<br>
  As for the USA, well, when I was young we &#8216;laughed&rsquo; at the fact that China had 500 million people.Never mind the ethnicity, but having 500 million people is simply no good.</p>

		<p>It appears that given the predicted numbers, the actual population of European descent in the world by 2100 will be around 5% - and that&rsquo;s a best case scenario. I also recall reading that in 1900 those of European descent made up approximately 30% of the total to give an idea of how things have regressed. </p>
<p>The likelihood of an ensuing economic collapse of the world economy, that could bring on unforseen political and social changes, gives me hope for the future. It is said that &#8220;a revolution begins in the hearts and minds of the people.&#8221; Imagine if at some point later the majority of the whites in the world had similar perceptions about racial issues that most of us who post on American Renaissance have - don&rsquo;t you think that inevitably social and political changes would follow that might allow our racial kin to find ways to stop the slow genocide to which we are being exposed by present cultural and governmental policies?</p>

<p>I hope conservatives in the U.S. begin having second thoughts about blocking the government from offering abortion, birth control and family planning services to developing countries and to the poor in our own country. Before the &#8220;Southern Strategy&#8221; transformed the Republican Party, Republicans had been dedicated supporters of many organizations they now revile, such as Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Perhaps Republicans need their own Thilo Sarrazin to write <i>Whites Abolish Themselves</i>, about conservative whites doing everything in their power to prevent non-whites from using birth control.<br>

		<p>One poster blames the [sic]  &#8220;Christian Churches&#8221; for feeding the masses of non-White (for that is the elephant in the room, is it not?) hominidity, which is the root cause of these predictions, and does so, as though it is our fault.</p>
<p>But, to be honest, it is the humanistic diverting away of White Christendom from the historic Church&rsquo;s mission and focus, [&#8220;He who does not care for HIS OWN, is worse than an infidel&#8221; - St. Paul] that came at the hands of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s assumption that &#8216;all hominids are our equals&rsquo; that is truly to blame.</p>
<p>Reading Avdeyev&rsquo;s &#8220;Raciology,&#8221; it is clear that American, English, and even Czarist Russian race science (and the Presidents, Kings, and Bishops of those respective countries) at the turn of the 20th Century (all clearly done, at a time when every country mentioned was also, &#8216;Christian&rsquo;) believed that Eugenics, and the planned cessation of such &#8216;indiscriminate breeding&rsquo; was the only hope for European man as the &#8216;sine qua non&rsquo; of the Homo Sapiens/Evolutionary Tree!</p>
<p>We have people in our own homelands on welfare, needing food, shelter, etc. I&rsquo;d much rather give to Mrs. Johnson or Mr. Erlangen down the street, than I would to the Somali who doesn&rsquo;t even BELONG in our nation. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need a &#8216;kinder, gentler&rsquo; &#8220;Xtianity.&#8221; We need the virile, manly approach of Joseph and the granaries, giving to the people of OUR realm the wheat that we saved in the &#8216;seven good years&rsquo; and leaving to God, those pagan nations who did not &#8216;reap, nor sow&rsquo; when they could&hellip;for our goal as Whites, as Europeans, is NOT to &#8216;invite the world, invade the world,&rsquo; but to CARE FOR ONE&rsquo;S OWN.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we ARE no better than Infidels. Which makes us just like those we think we are &#8216;saving&rsquo; who are the subject of this article. And no one will save &#8216;whitey&rsquo;, once the bread and circuses are finished.</p>

		<p>For the UN and the NYT the solution to overpopulation is no doubt obvious: white people need to have fewer kids. Furthermore, they will recommend that we provide even MORE medicine and food in the 3rd world in the belief that this will somehow &#8216;civilize&rsquo; them and therefore reduce their fertility rate, like in the west.

		<p>No one rescues the rescuers&hellip;  So why start a fire?</p>
<p>And here is some better idea for the progression of population growth-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
World, projected</p>
<p>2050-2100, medium variant: peak at 9.4 billion <br>
Uncertainty (low &amp; high variant) for 2050 between 8 and 10.5 billion, 2100 5.1 and ***14.2 billion*** <br>
All 21st Century growth is accounted for by the South: Africa, Asia and Latin America. The latter two are forecast to peak in the second half of the Century, ***Africa is not***. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/S48kV</p>
<p>Read and save the whole .pdf.</p>
<p>This is from AmRen&rsquo;s own archives-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
No. It will not do. Even as we see African states refusing to take action to restore something resembling civilisation in Zimbabwe, the begging bowl for Ethiopia is being passed around to us, yet again. It is nearly 25 years since Ethiopia&rsquo;s (and Bob Geldof&rsquo;s) famous Feed The World campaign, and in that time Ethiopia&rsquo;s population has grown from 33.5 million to 78 million today.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry. My conscience has toured this territory on foot and financially. Unlike most of you, I have been to Ethiopia; like most of you, I have stumped up the loot to charities to stop starvation there. The wide-eyed boy-child we saved, 20 years or so ago, is now a priapic, Kalashnikov-bearing hearty, siring children whenever the whim takes him.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Africa&rsquo;s peoples are outstripping their resources, and causing catastrophic ecological degradation. By 2050, the population of Ethiopia will be 177 million: The equivalent of France, Germany and Benelux today, but located on the parched and increasingly protein-free wastelands of the Great Rift Valley.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/POspy</p>
<p>The questions I have are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  We will not be able to sustain market-capitalism much past 2030.  So why create the social as well as biologic vectors that waste -even more resources- sustaining a &#8216;for profit&rsquo; system which creates the very stresses that suppress intelligent birth rates and exacerbates (California, post 1986 Amnesty, TFR = 4.4) poor, dumb ones, _in our own homelands_?</p>
<p>2.  What are Codex Alimentarius and H.R. 875 (which thankfully died in committtee) really about?  It looks like they are indeed getting set to &#8216;spike&rsquo; the foods of all populations with recombinant growth hormones but it also appears they are creating a system where the ability of small local populations to be self sustaining once mainline commercial resources are no longer sustainable is also about to be viciously suppressed.  If you want to create a population dependent on poisonously treated and genetically modified foodstuffs and yet -the system- by which these foods are distributed is itself subject to compromise (i.e. capitalism will fail) so that the elites ultimately gain nothing from it, what&rsquo;s the point?  Why inflict this kind of idiocy on population groups that have shown no historical evidence of organized ability to sustain mass-agro, aren&rsquo;t you just shooting yourself in the foot by creating a &#8216;market&rsquo; (mass population) that cannot be fed and does not remember how to self-subsist, even as a sub-caste servant class?</p>
<p>Codex Alimentarius (Food Rules)<br>
https://goo.gl/W6qpS</p>
<p>H.R.875 (U.S. Fed oversight of all private grown foods)<br>
https://goo.gl/d8Hhb</p>
<p>Someone knows what&rsquo;s about to happen because someone commissioned these studies and set up these plans, some of them going back to the 1960s or more.</p>
<p>Someone wants control over the population through our common &#8216;vulnerability&rsquo; to the need to eat.  The question remains however; what megalomaniacal moron would create a crisis simply for power when acting in our own self interests could yield the same degree of national and personal wealth (as &#8216;the good life&rsquo;) for the elites as their common racial group loyalty (i.e. intelligent servants) without the monumental risks to functioning social systems?  All for the apparent purpose of _undermining_ other, non-functional, ones and engendering dependency.</p>
<p>Something is going on and it&rsquo;s intentional and institutional, not runaway conditioned at all.</p>

<p>Estimated population of the world in 2100: </p>
<p><i><b>10.1 billion</b></i></p>
<p>Population of the world currently:</p>
<p><i><b>6.9 billion</b></i></p>
<p>Amount of growth:</p>
<p><i><b>3.2 billion</b></i></p>
<p>Amount of growth contributed by Africans: </p>
<p><i><b>2.6 billion</b> (3.6 billion projected - 1 billion currently)</i></p>
<p>Amount of growth without that of the Africans&hellip;:</p>
<p><i><b>.6 billion</b> (10.1 billion projected - 6.9 billion current - 2.6 billion African growth)</i></p>
<p>&hellip;otherwise known as the amount of growth contributed by <i>the rest of the damned world</i>   &mdash;   by Russia, by the US, by Canada, by all the European countries, by Australia, by the Middle East, by Japan (or not), by China, by Mexico, by Latin America:</p>
<p><i><b>600 million</b></i></p>
<p>A paltry amount, is it not? And how much of that, you want to guess, is contributed by the people of the stupider entries mentioned above   &mdash;   the Middle East, Mexico, Latin America and others unmentioned?</p>

		<p>I posted earlier that I thought:<br>
&#8220;The third world is the DEATH OF THE WORLD.&#8221;<br>
It seems clear that we all agree that this is so, and that it is WHITES who have made this phenomenon possible. In fact, whites are virtually 100% responsible for making it happen.</p>
<p>Because without our work to &#8220;save the starving millions,&#8221; to bring them medicine, educate them how not to defecate in their drinking water, etc., without building them power grids and pipelines, lending them all the engineering skills to erect modern-ish cities, they could not EXPLODE in numbers. (It goes without saying that all this work is for the reward; do- gooders swell their ego, and corporations froth over the prospect of new consumers).<br>
The innate traits  of Africans simply can NOT allow them to multiply as they have. In fact, what we have done, is akin to some kind of lab experiment, where someone dumps too much food in a medium for yeast to grow in, and the yeast froths up over the petri dish, and grows all over the Lab table. Well, if there&rsquo;s no more food  to eat, all the yeast will die back and disappear. Too bad this is our world, and not a lab table to be wiped down.  What we lose, and painfully so, we will not see again.</p>
<p>Assuming my viewpoint is true, how can we get the white and Asian (Chinese) world to stop it&rsquo;s meddling with pathetic, dangerous Africa?</p>
<p>Because I hear that the Chinese already have their claws in Africa. I also assume it&rsquo;s the jewel of wars to come that the Pentagon and the US (world) Military- Industrial Complex have their greedy eyes on. Boy, won&rsquo;t that be great&hellip;more wars in Africa, tens of millions of &#8220;refugees&#8221; to come enrich what&rsquo;s left of the white world!</p>

This is all a scam to get White people to REPLACE themselves and help the enemy destroy ourselves, period.</p>
<p>White empathy was instilled by OUR God to help our OWN race! Empathy for one&rsquo;s own kind. There is an article on Amren about misplaced White altruism. Read it sometime.</p>
