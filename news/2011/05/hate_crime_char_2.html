			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Brumfield, My Fox DC, May 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two teens are facing hate crime charges in the beating of a transgender woman at a McDonald&rsquo;s, an attack that was caught on video and posted online.</p>
<p>Teonna Brown, 18, was indicted Monday on assault and hate crime charges in the attack on Chrissy Lee Polis at the restaurant last month. She is also charged with assaulting a customer and a McDonald&rsquo;s employee who tried to intervene. A 14-year-old girl is facing the same charges in juvenile court. The Associated Press typically does not identify juveniles charged with crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A videotape of the April 18 beating showed a woman being attacked repeatedly while an employee and customer try to stop them, and the woman apparently having a seizure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Polis said she was confronted by a girl who spat in her face and accused Polis of talking to &#8220;my man.&#8221; Polis said another girl then also spat on her face, and that they then beat and kicked her, pulled her by the hair and tore off her earrings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Governor Martin O&rsquo;Malley issued this statement Tuesday following the hate crime charge in the beating of Chrissy Lee Polis last month in Rosedale: <br>
<em><br>
&#8220;I want to commend Baltimore County State&rsquo;s Attorney Scott D. Shellenberger for using every available means to prosecute the heinous beating of Chrissy Lee Polis last month. </p>
<p>&#8220;Even with Maryland&rsquo;s &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; law, it is clear that more must be done to protect the rights and dignity of transgendered people. In the struggle for justice and equality for all, I&rsquo;m committed to working with the Maryland General Assembly during the next legislative session to increase awareness and provide even greater protections for transgendered people. </p>
<p>&#8220;As some have noted, out of this awful beating has come a moment to foster a deeper understanding and respect for the dignity of all persons. We should not allow the moment to pass without greater action.&#8221;<br>

		<p>We are supposed to walk away from this article, thanks to Gov. O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s quote, thinking the hate crime enhancements were on grounds of TSTG.  But they actually don&rsquo;t state in the article that that was the case.  I think they&rsquo;re not saying it for a reason   &mdash;   That they were really race-based hate crimes riders.  If I&rsquo;m right, I fear that the only reason the S.A. filed those enhancements was to have leverage in a possible plea bargain.</p>

		<p>The victim claims she was attacked because the two thugs thought she was talking to one of their men. I&rsquo;d almost bet next weeks pay check they didn&rsquo;t have a clue she was transgendered. All they thought they saw was a white girl trying to take another of &#8220;theirs&#8221; and went ballistic.</p>
<p>It may not be a subject that is discussed much, but it enrages black women to see their men with a white woman, and I&rsquo;ve heard this first hand from more than one of them.</p>

		<p>Whites need to put this &#8220;Poor Us&#8221; attitude in the trash can. Let&rsquo;s quit stealing the Blacks&rsquo; act and start standing up.</p>
<p>Hate crime charges were filed against those thug girls because the Fairy Mafia raised holy hell with the local authorities. They protested at the sight of the crime, they clogged the waiting areas at the county attorney&rsquo;s office and they tied up the prosecutor&rsquo;s phone lines for two weeks.</p>
<p>If we would stick up for White crime victims as relentlessly as the gay folks stick up for their people there would be a lot more hate crime charges filed against the perpetrators of racially motivated Black on White violent crimes.</p>
<p>Start writing, start dialing and start making noise.  </p>

		<p>This incident raises many questions:</p>
<p>Was the assaulted party transgendered (i.e castrated &amp; excavated) or a transvestite?  Did Teonna know it? Did she simply think it was a white person competing for her guy?</p>
<p>Would it still be a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, if Teonna thought it was just a white woman(by birth) making a play for her guy? Or if she knew the victim&rsquo;s sexual configuration, would it still be a hate crime if Teonna was motivated by jealousy rather than trannsyphobia or homophobia?</p>
<p>If the victim had been a hetro white man minding his own business, would Gov O&rsquo;Malley become show any interest?</p>

		<p>This would have not have been labeled a hate crime if Teonna Brown was not a transgendered female.</p>
<p>Our US Attorney General Eric Holder has stated that whites can&rsquo;t be victims of racial injustice because we haven&rsquo;t suffered enough. Therefore, white people are not qualified to be victims of &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;. So her just being white would not have been enough to charge the two women with a hate crime, per Holder. Homosexual or transgendered people are second only to blacks for their protected status.</p>
<p>That is why nothing was done by our Dept. of Justice about members of the New Black Panther Party standing at a polling place and holding clubs to intimidate white people. </p>
<p>In other words, the very head of our Justice System has given the green light to blacks to treat white people anyway they want, with minimal interference, stopping just short of criminal (but not all the time). Go ahead and Google it, you&rsquo;ll find it. And Obama appointed this sorry excuse for an AG. Which, in my humble opinion, makes them both extremely racist. But I&rsquo;m sure they would disagree and try and say &#8220;black people can&rsquo;t be racist&#8221;. Oh yes they can! And that is another reason we need to vote Obama out in 2012, among the hundreds of others.</p>

Of course it would have been a hate crime. Would hate crimes charges have been filed?? Yes if it was a White woman or &#8220;transgender&#8221; or whatever he was. Highly unlikely if he was a White, heterosexual male. </p>

<p>Since when do anatomically males have the &#8220;right&#8221; to use female washrooms? I am not talking about transexuals. Those who have gone the FULL distance and had all their sexual genitalia removed and recreated to become anatomically female. I&rsquo;m talking about males (who to be crude, still have their junk) who simply choose to &#8220;live&#8221; as a &#8220;woman&#8221;. Do you want your little girl near these people in a washroom? Do adult females want them in their change rooms at gyms or pools? In any case this was only decreed to be a hate crime because LGBT are an organized group. They were all over the police and politicians on this. What about the normal white person who gets beaten by a group of blacks. WHO SPEAKS FOR US?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right!</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about this story to me is how the &#8220;evil white supremacists&#8221; (I&rsquo;m being sarcastic here) have been way ahead of everyone else, especially the $PLC.</p>
<p>The $PLC wrote a begrudging &#8220;so what? big deal&#8221; article about the incident days after the incident, way behind white advocates who were raising cain and already miles ahead in considering all the different ways to view the story.</p>
<p>At the rate anti-white violence is increasing in this country, I think it&rsquo;s possible that there will be an incident (or several incidents) where the world of online white advocacy will &#8220;break through&#8221; and make a major mainstream impression that could wake up millions of whites. If anything is going to break through it&rsquo;s going to be something like this (or several incidents like this in rapid succession).<br>

		<p>Why this incident is considered a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; and the 2007 rape, torture and murder of Channon Christian and Chris Newsom in Knoxville, Tennessee wasn&rsquo;t is really one for the books.  This young white couple were the victimes of a gang of five black thugs who carjaced them at gunpoint, kidnapped them, then brutally raped both of these kids, sodomized Chris and forced his girlfriend Channon to watch it and then murdered them each in turn.  Chris Newsome was shot in the back of his head and his body set on fire to destroy the evidence.  Channon was raped, sodomized with a broken chair leg and then beaten to death.  All of the perps have been tried and convicted.  Letalvis Cobbins, Lemaricus Davidson and George Thomas have been tried and convicted on 46 counts of kidnapping, rape and murder.  Davidson was sentenced to death by lethal injection, and Thomas and Cobbins to life in prison. The other two recieved lesser sentences.  The murder of these two white kids hardly received any media attention while this case has because of the &#8216;gay&rsquo; lifestyle implications.</p>

		<p>Whites had better learn to stick together FAST or we won&rsquo;t survive to the midpoint of the current century - whites who want to exclude gays and transgendered people from the white civil rights movement are the problem, not the solution. </p>
<p>Considering how many white men - including straight men - are raped and beaten and tortured in prison by blacks and Hispanic gangs and infected with HIV, doesn&rsquo;t it seem utterly irrelevant whether the victim here was a woman, a transvestite, transsexual, hermaphrodite, etc.?</p>
<p>The white civil rights movement exists ONLY when the message is:</p>
<p>ANY attack on ANY white worldwide is totally unacceptable and will have serious consequences.</p>
<p>No exceptions.</p>

		<p>To 18  &mdash;  Lakeview Senior, why is there any need for &#8220;hate crime&#8221; designation in the Knoxville Horror when harsh punishment has already been meted out?  &#8220;Hate crime&#8221; laws are only one step short of &#8220;thought crime&#8221; laws, and as such, shouldn&rsquo;t exist in what is supposed to be a free country.  They only exist to elevate one or more groups to a greater protected status than others, which is inherently unjust.</p>
