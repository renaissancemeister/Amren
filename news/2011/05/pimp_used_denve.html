			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Fender, Denver Post, May 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An alleged pimp nicknamed &#8220;Jell-O&#8221; faces felony charges stemming from an unusually sophisticated prostitution ring run throughout the metro area out of some of Denver&rsquo;s best-known strip clubs, police say.</p>
<p>A search-warrant affidavit filed recently in Denver District Court provides a glimpse into what authorities say was a prostitution service that financed Germaine &#8220;Jell-O&#8221; Wallace&rsquo;s extravagant lifestyle of flashy cars and exotic pets in a Douglas County mansion and the intimidation tactics police say he used to recruit and control the women in his employ.</p>
<p>The affidavit and other court documents name about 10 women with ties to the operation and suggest each was required to bring in a minimum of $500 a night between their legitimate stripping jobs and turning illegal tricks in backrooms.</p>
<p>Four of the women also face charges for allegedly helping Wallace, 38, run the business.</p>
<p><b>Big house, exotic pets</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Records show Wallace lived in a rented $1.3 million mansion tucked into an 18-home luxury subdivision in the hills north of Castle Rock. </p>
<p>There, police say he and a cadre of prostitutes lived on 35 acres of land where they rode dirt bikes and four-wheelers, affidavits say.</p>
<p>He kept exotic pets  &mdash;  a now-deceased serval (an African wild cat) named Goldie and a small mammal from the rainforest called a kinkajou, affidavits show. </p>
<p>Police say Wallace also kept a collection of guns, including an assault rifle and a pink handgun that were seized from a Parker storage shed. </p>
<p>His half-dozen vehicles included a leased Bentley and an orange Pontiac Fiero that was made to look like a Lamborghini. </p>
<p>One car  &mdash;  a blue-silver minivan  &mdash;  showed a logo of Bugs Bunny grabbing Jessica Rabbit with the words &#8220;choose up&#8221; written on the side, street slang encouraging prostitutes to pick a better pimp, according to police reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Methods of recruitment</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Entry into Wallace&rsquo;s world came quickly for one 20-year-old woman, whose name is being withheld because she alleges he raped her. </p>
<p>Denver police busted her after she allegedly offered an undercover officer sex in a strip club during the sting that helped make the case against Wallace.</p>
<p>Within weeks of coming to Denver last fall to dance at Centerfold Showclub, the woman said, she was recruited by a fellow dancer and the so-called &#8220;mother&#8221; of Wallace&rsquo;s group. Kara Laughead allegedly invited the woman back to the mansion and promised, &#8220;My man will take good care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newcomer said Wallace forced himself on her that night with the threat of violence and that by the next day she was being schooled in the rules of the house.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She typically brought in $800 a night and said she had to text Wallace every hour with earning updates.</p>
<p>She was told which clubs to work, how much to charge, how to solicit johns and club-specific details regarding where to perform the sex acts, she told detectives. </p>
<p>The women at the house were allegedly driven to and from the strip clubs or &#8220;dates&#8221; in other locations by Wallace or other men in his crew.</p>
<p>At the end of every night, the women dumped their money onto a table for Wallace, the affidavit says.</p>
<p>Wallace allegedly ran prostitutes through big-name clubs such as the Diamond Cabaret, Centerfold Showclub and PT&rsquo;s All Nude for several months without knowledge of the club owners.</p>
<p>Four alleged prostitutes who traveled with Wallace to Colorado would apply to dance at clubs, then recruit from among their new colleagues, police say.</p>
<p>Laughead, 24, Allison Kelly, 25, Teresa Weeks, 22, and Amber Wilson, 24, all face Class 3 felony counts of pimping.</p>
<p>They would perform sex acts in the private suites and booths typically reserved for one-on-one lap dances, according to the affidavits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t Wallace&rsquo;s first run-in with the law. </p>
<p>Records from the Miramar Police Department in Florida show Wallace was arrested in 2002 after he and another man repeatedly sexually assaulted an 18-year-old woman and a 17-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The teens were kept against their will in a house where Wallace and another man lived with a number of other women, reports show.</p>
<p>He served 233 days in the Broward County Jail for four felony counts of armed sexual battery and two counts of armed battery, records show.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald at the time reported that Wallace and his associate persuaded the two teens to fly down from Ohio for a visit, assaulted them and pressured them into prostitution. </p>

		<p>I wince when I hear people pontificate how White kids are taught by their  educated parents to never ever fight and consquently the only tool they have to protect themselves during a shakedown or a putdown is a stupid self depreciating smile coupled with a hands up palm out body language. The reason I wince is cause it describes me to a tee!!<br>
 What forced me to change my demeanor even before my thinking, was a pimp who strolled in off the street and set up shop right in the middle of the outdoor patio cafe I was left  to run at night. I figured out two things. One, he was my problem cause I was in charge and two, I somehow had to draw the power of who owns the turf inside me. It may have been &#8220;his streets&#8221; but it was my bar. I forget the moment when I stood up for myself, and shook off a lifetime of taboos and social conventions in the bargain, but I never forgot the dude`s name. He called himself, &#8220;Lord Leigh&hellip;&#8221;<br>

		<p>So what&rsquo;s the incentive for the women?</p>
<p>In this day and age, &#8216;for tax reasons&rsquo;, vice is about the only illegality left that the law will pursue, regardless of race (mind you, they won&rsquo;t shut down clubs with &#8216;private booths and suites&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s another story&hellip;).</p>
<p>Yet if any of these girls could have busted this sterling example of black manhood for abusing them and stealing _their money_, simply by walking into a police station for as little as a 6 month misdemeanor sentence, likely done on probation, why did it take so long to get this guy in the vice unit&rsquo;s sights?</p>
<p>I have little respect for white women who let themselves be used like animals as the paid sexual toys of strangers.  None at all for those who denigrate their race by allowing a black man to put them under his thumb.</p>
<p>So I figure there has to be an angle here I am not seeing.</p>
<p>Btw.  $500 per night X4 women X 5 days a week X 50 weeks a year = 500,000 dollars, annual.  Not bad but certainly not enough to keep a harem of four women in good running condition.</p>
<p>This is what Colorado Law says-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Punishments/Sentences<br>
•Prostitution convictions result in sentences of up to 6 months in the local jail and a possible fine of $50 to $750. This is a Class 3 Misdemeanor charge.<br>
•Persons convicted of pimping may serve 4 to 12 years in prison and be required to pay fines from $3,000 to $750,000 depending on circumstances. This is considered a Class 3 Felony.<br>
•Brothel owners seem to receive much less severe sentences when convicted. Only a Class 2 Misdemeanor, brothel owners may serve 3 months to a year in jail and incur a fine of $250 to $1,000.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/CspsK</p>
<p>Just to show you how screwed up our justice system really is, the above link also says that _Pandering_ (forcing sexual prostitution under threat of violence or intimidation) is a Class 5 felony.  That&rsquo;s good for 1-3 years, 4 if there is an &#8216;extreme risk&rsquo; condition attached (I&rsquo;m gonna kill you for this!).</p>

<p>Typical feral black preying on troubled white girls.  He should get the needle, regardless of color.</p>
<p>This should be mandatory reading for all white kids along with the Knoxville and Kansas City massacres, among others. </p>
<p>But before I end this, there needs to be a major amount of the blame put on their parents.  If they were raised right, this never would have happened.</p>

		<p>Someone should interview the families of these girls to find out what went wrong. How would the families raise the girls differently? Publish your study, and maybe even become a recognized expert in the study of white girls in these situations. What could be more rewarding than that - even as a part-time hobby for an amateur. I suppose you&rsquo;ll need donor money for travelling expenses to meet the families. You might need a thick skin for the insults you&rsquo;ll get. Maybe there is a chance of assault but sometimes that can be lowered with courtesy. If you&rsquo;re a beginner needing training then look up investigative journalism or social work.</p>

		<p>The article is disgusting. Ja, I am quite sure the club owners knew &#8220;nothing&#8221;.<br>
Tim mc hugh: that&rsquo;s quite a story. I have noticed the lack of self defense fighting skills in our people, I for one am a believer in the philosophy: learn to fight, barehanded and weaponed, because even if you never need to fight, the possibility is always there as long as there are thugs in the world. If the enemies of everyone -criminals- learn to fight, then we do no good by letting them keep that for themselves. Learn to fight because someone else has, and they may come looking for you. Experience has driven this lesson home for me.<br>
Black girls fight dirty, take it from me and my ear.<br>
Yes I am a girl.</p>

		<p>Nearly every girl involved with stripping and prostitution is a sexually abused drug addict.  Blacks sense this like they sense fear and take advantage of it.  It&rsquo;s not that black pimp&rsquo;s fault for turning those girls into what they are, it&rsquo;s the fault of the white men who were supposed to care for them earlier in their lives.  Abandon or abuse your white daughter and this is what happens.  </p>

  <br>
 Sounds like you&rsquo;re shifting the blame away from the black pimps and prostitutes back to white men here. I have a longtime, highly educated liberal friend, whose troubled daughter turned to dancing in stip clubs. I can categorically say that not only was his daughter not abused by her father; she was given every advantage and opportunity to succeed. She washed out of the military and a variety of colleges and universities. Her problems, I would say, are primarily of her own making. </p>
<p>Her parents are still struggling with her self-destructive behavior today. I&rsquo;m not saying that abused white women aren&rsquo;t psychologically vulnerable to this type of degradation and abuse, but all abused women don&rsquo;t become prostitutes or drug addicts. I condemn all white men who abuse their daughters, but ultimately, you are responsible for the life you live.</p>

		<p>As to the question raised by many as to where to assign blame, I would add government monopoly schooling to the list of contributing factors.</p>
<p>These children   &mdash;  - and their families   &mdash;  - are captives of the particular K-12 institution assigned by a local government body (school boards) for 12-13 years of each child&rsquo;s lives. </p>
<p>Not every child has the resilience to deal with cope the negative anti-white, anti-intellectual, multicultural and peer pressure-saturated processing associated with government-run schooling.</p>
<p>It is true that there are fine, dedicated individual teachers and administrators in these monoopoly systems, just as there were fine individual dedicated officials on now defunct governing apparatus of the old Soviet Union, but, overall, the effect on the population of state run schooling is profoundly negative. </p>

		<p>I agree with Sardonicus. In the end each person is responsible for his or her plight. The early adulthood is critical, though. Some people are going to be thrill-seekers, ever increasing the stakes, no matter how they were raised. I have a young daughter, and I will go to the ends of the earth for her best interests. Now with that, she has to want to achieve excellence, too. Pr my efforts &amp; my wife&rsquo;s efforts will be ineffective. </p>
<p>This story is like the alcoholic who won&rsquo;t get help. The White prostitute has to want to change, and see the light, resisting temptations from the dark side. Significant time in prison will teach these women that black women won&rsquo;t be too friendly to them, especially when the blacks find out they were sexing it up with/for a black guy. Reality is a bear.</p>

		<p>The common thread for all prostitutes is drug addiction. Pimps control these women via narcotics. Once these women become addicted; they are very easily controlled by the one who supplies the drugs. It is as true in Paris or Thailand as it is in Detroit. It is a sad and pitiful state of affairs. Fathers; be good to your daughters and that does not mean spoiling them. </p>

		<p>I lived in Denver for many years and often went to the bus depot, which was located downtown, to catch a bus to visit family in Nebraska. It was not unusual to see black pimps there waiting to prey and recruit young girls, mostly white. And I can recall the time my boss took me to a gentleman&rsquo;s club&hellip;.high class strip joint&hellip;.. and this big ugly black guy walks in and one of the girls, white, made a scene and threw hers arms around him. That was enough for me and I walked out. One last point, at alot of these clubs the women are white, asian, or hispanic, never black, but black men sure do like to frequent them.</p>

		<p>The race of their pimp may have nothing do with them liking black men. Rather, it may due to fact that pimps tend to come<br>
from a poor background. And many prostitutes are approached by<br>
pimps to work them. And many do so unwillingly after being threatened. </p>
<p>Also not all prostitutes enter the trade because of drug problems<br>
though many become drug addicts after awhile . Some are recent <br>
runaways while there are those who left home at an early age<br>
and didnt get the proper skill or educaton to land a decent <br>
paying job .</p>
<p>Many of us can easily come up with ways to lessen this problem<br>
such as stiffer sentences for pimps, better drug education<br>
for students and better advice to parents in raising their daughters . However we must be aware that no matter how<br>
