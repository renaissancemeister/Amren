<h1>&#8216;I Am Grateful for a Second Chance,&rsquo; Says Officer Suspended Over Ethnic Insult</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Miletich, Seattle Times, May 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Seattle police Detective Shandy Cobane expressed relief Thursday after he was suspended, but not fired, for threatening to beat the &#8220;Mexican piss&#8221; out of a Latino man during a robbery investigation last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for a second chance,&#8221; said an emotional Cobane, reading from a prepared statement at Seattle police headquarters.</p>
<p>Cobane spoke to reporters minutes after Chief John Diaz announced he had suspended the 17-year officer without pay for 30 days  &mdash;  the most severe punishment allowed short of firing.</p>
<p>As part of the discipline, Cobane  &mdash;  who also was demoted  &mdash;  has agreed not to appeal his suspension, and promised to meet with Latino groups to mend fences and to speak to other officers about the importance of racial and ethnic sensitivity.</p>
<p>He will undergo additional training and has accepted a &#8220;last-chance&#8221; agreement with the department, under which he would be fired for engaging in any other serious misconduct.</p>
<p>Diaz also said that if officers use such language in the future, they will be fired.</p>
<p>While Diaz characterized Cobane&rsquo;s punishment as extremely severe, a Latino legal group criticized the decision, saying he should have been fired.</p>
<p>Cobane sparked a public outcry last May when video emerged of an April 17, 2010, incident in which he was seen telling the prone Latino man he was going to &#8220;beat the [expletive] Mexican piss out of you, homey. You feel me?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last May, the Seattle chapter of the NAACP and other civil-rights groups urged county prosecutors to prosecute Cobane, and a coalition of minority organizations formed after the incident pressed for his firing.</p>
<p>The incident was one of several that prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to open a broad civil-rights investigation in March into whether Seattle police have engaged in a pattern of unnecessary force and biased policing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diaz&rsquo;s decision came against the backdrop of high-profile, use-of-force incidents in the past year, as well as the filing of a misdemeanor charge last month against veteran Officer James J. Lee, who was accused of fourth-degree assault arising from the repeated kicking of a teenage African-American suspect inside a convenience store in October.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After video of the incident was first broadcast, Cobane issued a tearful public apology a day later.</p>
<p>In September, prosecutors announced they would not charge Cobane with the felony of malicious harassment, the state&rsquo;s hate-crime law. Prosecutors said that although Cobane used offensive language about Monetti&rsquo;s ethnicity, &#8220;such language is not in and of itself a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>In December, the Seattle City Attorney&rsquo;s Office said it would not seek misdemeanor assault charges against Cobane or Woollum because they used reasonable force under state law to gain compliance from a suspect who wasn&rsquo;t following police commands.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fe Lopez, president of the Latina/o Bar Association of Washington, said Thursday she was disappointed that Cobane wasn&rsquo;t fired.</p>
<p>Lopez  &mdash;  whose group was listed among the 34 who joined the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington in calling for the Justice Department investigation, said she was pleased Diaz put his officers on notice that the use of racial epithets or inflammatory language will be a firing offense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a cultural thing that the department must address once and for all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t move forward if you protect and support officers who have or show a racial bias. You need to be willing to say no.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We may have delayed such a sad spectacle in Ga. for a while.  Our White Governor just signed an anti-illegal alien bill, finally!  Whites in Ga. seem to be temporarily motivated to retake our own state away from the Mexicans that we see EVERYWHERE!  Do you hear on TV that there are only 11 million &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; in America?  They are all here in Georgia.  Thanks to our White Governor, we expect to get that number down to about 10 million in a year, but it will freeze there and then start to rise dramatically after Obama gives them all amnesty, citizenship, and the vote.  Georgians can&rsquo;t tolerate being called racist, so they will cave in when the time comes.  MLK is buried in Ga., and he gives moral authority to anyone who is anti-white.</p>
<p>Praise Georgia for doing the right thing, but don&rsquo;t expect us to keep doing the right thing. We&rsquo;ll sink with the rest of you.<br>

		<p>Words fail me.  I actually went through the same type of thing.  <br>
Difference was that I never said the things I was accused of.  I was not even in the area.</p>
<p>The coalition of White marxists and black radicals finally drove me out of the government job.  The kids and I went on welfare and moved out to the boondocks.</p>
<p>It was wonderful.  I was poor but after the horrors of a black and marxist infested &#8220;hostile job environment&#8221; all those years I don&rsquo;t regret being driven out of the job.</p>
<p>I would suggest that no White Seattle police officer ever again arrest a hispanic or black.  Let them take over the city.</p>

		<p>Had the circumstances been reversed it wouldn&rsquo;t have even made the news. In fact, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made the news this time if the &#8220;NAACP and other civil-rights groups&#8221; hadn&rsquo;t already been waging a campaign against Seattle. They were just looking for molehills they can turn into mountains and exploit for political reasons.</p>

<p>Oh, good Lord!  For saying the word, MEXICAN? The guy was even crying while apologizing! How many of these White wimpish men do we have to witness apologizing to someone just because they have black or brown skin??? </p>
<p>No wonder nonwhites think White men are wimps and cowards! Will you people quit apologizing for some &#8220;offense&#8221; to some minority! They use worse than this against us daily! Use your time FIGHTING the charges and demand that NO ONE can lose a job or get jail time over offending some minority or group! They are always OFFENDED because our system allows them to profit from it and for Whites to grovel even more!  </p>

<p>Since when is &#8220;Mexican&#8221; a racial epithet? Ricardo Montalbán (RIP), Vicki Carr, President Calderón, Selena Gomez, Gilbert Roland (RIP) are/were Mexican and White.</p>
<p>Do we determine a person&rsquo;s race by the language spoken. The time has come to stand up to the school yard bullies; both Hispanic and Black. This is all part of the agenda to destroy America by destroying those who founded her.</p>
<p>Check out this link. They&rsquo;re not even pretending to hide their true goal. Poor demented Ronald Reagan (RIP) retired thinking that he had defeated Communism!  They&rsquo;ve been more emboldened. Notice all the Mexican flags and the red flags with the hammer and sickle and pimp and mass murderer Ernesto &#8220;Che&#8221; Guevara&rsquo;s image emblazoned on them. Also notice the Blacks who are supporting them. Don&rsquo;t count on strife between Blacks and Hispanics to save our country. They both consider us enemies. Either we act or we disappear and the place to start is at the polls in 2012. All non-self hating White people must vote as a block just as the enemy does. These traitors in Washington have to be swept out of office; both Demicans and Republicrats.</p>
<p>If these pictures don&rsquo;t get you thinking, then there IS no hope.</p>

		<p>So then, &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to beat the [expletive] piss out of you, homey.&#8221; would have been fine? The word &#8220;Mexican&#8221; is the whole problem here? </p>
<p>Actually, in a certain sense I agree: the appearance of the word in reference to anybody found north of the Rio Grande indicates a problem. Imagine what would happen to the crime rate if those who commit most of the crime [non-whites] were not here, and the police could devote themselves completely to dealing with that smaller amount of crime committed by whites. The crime rate would plummet by even more than simply the amount of non-white criminals subtracted, resulting in a society that whites could actually have their own children in. You know, like the one our forefathers made. Right here. </p>
<p>But I digress (?) - back to the &#8220;incident&#8221; (more like:&#8221;symptom of deathly ill society&#8221;): </p>
<p>Need we add that to our lexicon of baby-babble as we unmake ourselves and say &#8220;M-word&#8221; now? Must the nearest country to the south now be referred to as the &#8220;M-place&#8221;? </p>
<p>I know, I&rsquo;m being ridiculous. They simply want us to say nothing at all, except perhaps: &#8220;Here are the keys to my - sorry -  YOUR house and car, my - uh, sorry again - YOUR wife and daughter are in the backyard. Please enjoy all of it while I go jump off a cliff. Sir. &#8221;  In fact, as the second poster attests, you need not actually say or do anything at all - they agree among themselves that you, whites, have got to go, and throw you out. </p>
<p>The only question remaining is whether we will go quietly into total, eternal darkness, accompanied not by songs of praise of our great deeds but by the terrible screams of our wives and daughters as the dark hordes take their hostile pleasures upon them. Whether we will resist our own genocide, or tearfully apologize just not getting on with suicide quickly enough to suit the invaders. </p>

		<p>This is a kangaroo court. Getting fired from a job for dishonorable conduct is very serious. Here there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a trial and sentencing process that satisfies principles of justice.

		<p>The crazy thing is that had Cobane actually beaten the guy without any comment, he likely would not have faced any discipline. Beating a person is no big deal, but uttering anything that is politically incorrect and the job is on the line.</p>

		<p>Did the Mexican who was robbing the store apologize for what he done? How about all the illegals? Do they ever apologize to us for attempting to destroy our country? Please, to all white people, quit backing down for what you feel or believe! It&rsquo;s not racist to dislike a person of color, it&rsquo;s your right not to like them if you so choose. Anyone who has lived around these people choose to dislike them because of who and what these people are. So stand up and get a hold of yourself, believe in yourself and quit giving our country away! </p>

Sad to say, this is wishful thinking. During that time period  America did not have the level of mass immigration of mexicans that have flooded our borders and rapaciously imposed their culture upon us. It&rsquo;s is all but too late.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just putting this out there as food for thought and I don&rsquo;t have any proof but the leftist kooks use alot of sophisticated propaganda to influence people from fake polls to street actors to their control over the media.  This whole thing could be contrived with the Mexican and the officer both in on it.  It&rsquo;s a way to control people and place a mental straightjacket on them.</p>

		<p>Really?, really?, you have got to be kidding me. He got a 30 day suspension for something that trivial? amazing.  I almost guarantee you that like most cops, he is a racial realist and that if you got him alone and he felt he could speak freely, he is not one bit sorry. The whole tears while speaking thing was nothing more than a good acting job fueled by fears of unemployment in a near depression economy and the thought of losing his retirement. If he did not like Mexicans before think how he feels now that he has been publicly humiliated. If I was him I would never arrest another Latino as long I was on the force save crimes against children.</p>

I would suggest that no White Seattle police officer ever again arrest a hispanic or black. Let them take over the city.</p>
<p>We have the same thing in England and Britain and in a police force made up of largely white members you can imagine how bad it gets with white officers forever having to tip toe around  the feelings of Muslims, Sikhs, Blacks, Women, Gays, Transgender&hellip;. So wouldnt it be a really sweet thing if  one day every straight white /male officer thought damn it to hell, I&rsquo;m having the week off. But I suspect these draconian measures are more about gagging us then protecting the feelings of immigrants and minorities. Thanks to &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; the police and social services now has Black Magic, Voodoo,and Witchcraft to contend with and to add to the list of enrichment we already have here. I think it must be something  we whites are  putting in our water. </p>

		<p>Communism always begins breaking the spirit of a nation like this - getting a dedicated cop to &#8220;confess publicly his thought crimes&#8221;. After this will come imprisonment in mental asylums for &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;. The Russian people didn&rsquo;t believe it could happen to them either, but it did.</p>
<p>Do Whites get equal treatment under the law?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;The goal of abolishing the white race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed white supremacists&hellip;</p>

<p>How many times I as a white woman have heard terrible racist remarks made against whites by Latinos and NOTHING was done to those Latinos who made the remarks. They retained their jobs,classroom status, etc.</p>
<p>This is just another way to disempower the white man. The ethnocentric groups use fear to terrorize whites.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Oh, good Lord! For saying the word, MEXICAN? The guy was even crying while apologizing! How many of these White wimpish men do we have to witness apologizing to someone just because they have black or brown ski??&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I too am sick of seeing virtually ALL of these people consistently back down and grovel as required by Political Correctness. But some of them don&rsquo;t have to do that, and shame on them!</p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t be too harsh on THIS guy. He is a civil servant who has invested 17 years in his job and has probably  just 3 years to go before getting that pension. Can he afford to throw all of that away?   He has already lost his detective title and pay.  Look at it from his point of view. There are many people who are locked in his predicament.</p>
<p>I reserve my greatest scorn for those who can afford to stand their ground, but who crumble under anyway when they don&rsquo;t really have to. They are contemptible.</p>

		<p>About the worst insult I can think of to fling at a white person nowadays is that he/she is acting like a devolved cretin and doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be white. Maybe Latino activists know in their heart of hearts that calling someone &#8220;Mexican&#8221; is indeed an insult.</p>

		<p>In Mexico, the Mexicans fear the cops and run to the DTOs for protection from them.  Guess why.  Cops don&rsquo;t care what criminals or the public think of them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Are Scots that well organized, ethnically conscious. and militant? I doubt it. Until they (and we) are, they will get zilch. Not all minority groups are equal; some minority groups are more equal than others.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Society will collapse as we become minorities for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Minorities will not be able or interested in sustaining a high level of cultural as infrastructure maintenance and whites will not support an ethnic dominated society as they do their own.</p>
<p>2.  White minorityship will come sometime around 2025-2042.  By which time, this nation will have been without petro dominance and hend a stable currency value for at least 10-15 years.  None of the &#8216;shared&rsquo; privileges of rampant consumerism and make-work service economics will have been working for a similar period.  Without &#8216;individualist&rsquo; material wealth to distract us and assuming we have not been wiped out in isolated pockets, it will be too late to see the error of importing an ethnic wage slave class.  But it will not be too late for racial identity to become the dominant political stance.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
After the man moved a hand to his face, Cobane is seen apparently trying to stop the movement with his boot.</p>
<p>Moments later, Officer Mary Woollum is seen stomping on the back of the man&rsquo;s leg or knee.</p>
<p>Two of the three men, including Monetti, were later freed. The third man and another suspect identified nearby were arrested on armed-robbery charges.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind here is that the Mexican in question, probably suffering from a face-meets-concrete abrasion or broken nose, reached for his face and was promptly kicked in the knee by a white female cop.</p>
<p>The white female cop probably did use excessive force, given Monetti was already on the ground and there were multiple other officers to back her next (taser or mace or baton) play if he tried to lever himself up.</p>
<p>But it was only the white male that got axed by the (&#8216;Latina/o Lawyers Association&rsquo;) PC Mafiosa.  And the reason?  Because he was the better propaganda target.</p>
<p>Even though:</p>
<p>A.  Cops are allowed to lie and threaten, falsely, if it helps them solve a case.</p>
<p>B.  Cobane used words to intimidate rather than force to cripple, a helpless male.</p>
<p>Machismo is important in Hispanic societies, being &#8216;controlled&rsquo; by a woman is a no-no.  Getting stomp-kicked in the back of the knee risks permanent ligament and tendon damage.</p>
<p>But only the white man was really punished.  For saying the truth.  And avoiding overt violence.</p>

		<p>I have never, on your web site, advocated any sort of open violence or rebellion against the government as a means for the White majority to restore our nation to its former glory. </p>
<p>However, I do not advocate simply kissing minorities in the hopes that they will hold enough bake sales to raise plane fare back to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>When you reported on the Mexicans who took over the TUSD school board meeting last week, I pointed out the White students in TUSD could engage in the same, basically, lawful behaviors that Mexican kids engage in here in El Paso whenever they do not want to study English in school. When I taught English to gangbangers in middle school, they managed to boycott and shut down my class on a regular basis and NOTHING was done to them. I couldn&rsquo;t teach because they refused to learn. When I left, they couldn&rsquo;t keep the same sub in the class more than a week, and the next school year the new &#8220;permanent teacher&#8221; abandoned the class after a week! What the kids did works and they were not sanctioned!</p>
<p>When I advocated the same, basically lawful behavior as a means to coerce the TUSD school board, you censored me. I can understand you censoring me if I had told the kids to bring sticks and start a riot, but I only advocated what I know to be lawful resistance (yes, technically it&rsquo;s truancy to skip class, but the last thing a principal would ever want is for hordes of reporters and angry parents descending upon his campus for trying to cite hundreds of students for out sitting in the hallways). I was disappointed.</p>
<p>When you reported on this blog that a cop had been severely sanctioned for using a &#8220;racial epithet&#8221; while trying to apprehend a Mexican who was resisting arrest, I suggested that under similar circumstances a cop ought to simply keep his mouth shut and act on his feelings in silence. The suspect would not have cooperated with the officer simply by being asked nicely, or even if the cop did some sort of sycophantic behavior. According to the article, the cop most certainly did use force against the suspect and was exonerated for it. Again, you censored me for advocating something that was basically lawful. </p>
<p>The world is not uniformly a nice place. The objectives that your website advocates will never be realized by rational discussion with minorities. It is possible that White Americans will eventually rally behind a strong leader who will use military and police *force* to attain our shared socio-political objectives without resorting to a White Revolution. I certainly hope that is how things come about.</p>
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s your website and you certainly can decide who does, and does not, get to post. However, I would appreciate it if you would cut me a little slack when I advocate a &#8220;get off your &hellip; and do some lawful resistance&#8221; position. I have no intention of ever saying anything at your site that would get me-or you-in trouble with the law. </p>

<p><br>
Perhaps by just watching what we say, knowing the PC deal as it exists. That way there will be nothing to regret or apologize for after a slip of the tongue. You never know when some touchy person will get offended at the most minor comment. </p>
<p>I survived thirty years in a government job much like his, by keeping my mouth shut and my opinions strictly to myself. I NEVER  used racial terms, told  harmless racial jokes, or even engaged in  conversation about race - even when it was entirely innocent and others around me were doing it. I would prefer to leave the room. I treated all conversation about race like the plague.   They got nothing out of me.</p>
<p>Thus, I kept out of trouble and I was a survivor. I never had anything to have to apologize for.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a beginning.  It&rsquo;s easier to hold your tongue than have to apologize later. It&rsquo;s not an ideal situation, I don&rsquo;t claim it is, but that&rsquo;s what we have to deal with in present-day America.</p>

		<p>As I read this I grew somewhat sick to my stomach as I relived a horror brought on by not a sliver of a word but by doing my job.  In the governmental agency I worked I attempted to uncover huge losses of workers&rsquo; compensation payments and payouts.  In some of the more egregious cases there was plenty of circumstancial evidence to prove these were fraud.  However, this would require the assignment of detectives to obtain the necessary evidence.  Instead, the director of the department, a female who had been fired from another law enforcement agency, decided that too many of the accused would be black and hispanic, particularly females.  I was given one chance to beg for my job, to become a &#8220;good boy&#8221; and become this woman&rsquo;s slave.  I went home one day and tried to justify what I would become.  I had a spouse with cancer and two children depending on only my income.  To make matters worse, I had a parent that was near death, all known to my agency management.  I just couldn&rsquo;t do it and continued to do my job as my gut told me.  The woman and my direct supervisor, a wimp male, conspired to fire me with administrative action that was faked.  I had enough time to retire and if I didn&rsquo;t take that choice I knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to phony up reasons to take my retirement.  So I walked, yeah I would like to have fought my way out of this but took the only way to save my family.  So I have finally felt ok with my decision but before you run this cop into the ground know this, even though it is a romantic notion of the individual in this country, fighting the good fight against criminals and other bad guys, it is just a notion.  We, the people, have very little time left as a republic, it may be our fault for not raging and going down fighting.  I just don&rsquo;t know anymore.</p>

<p>***************************</p>
<p>That is a story that I can relate to!  As a manager within  a large city agency,  I discovered a woman (black) in the payroll dept. who had put herself in for cash overtime for having worked every single holiday over the past year.  She did this months afterwards, as an adjustment, when it was not noticed.  She had worked none of those holidays, and in fact the agency was closed on all of those days.  I further discovered  that she had also given herself night differential, meal allowances, and every other benefit that she could grab - none of which she was entitled to.</p>
<p>I did a lot of careful digging before saying a word, and came up with a pile of evidence. When she was confronted, she became  extremely loud,  indignant,  threatening a lawsuit. She raged that she was being persecuted. (She was a terrible loudmouth and troublemaker; all of upper management was terrified of her.  I heard that she had collected a very hefty settlement from her last job, which which she bought a  luxury apartment and two houses in the suburbs.  She bragged about it!)</p>
<p>When I went to the Department head, Mister Big Shot, he put his hands over his ears and said, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t tell me anything I don&rsquo;t want to hear now!!!&#8221;  He also warned me that if my allegations were true, then I had better be prepared to explain how this had gone on under my watch, and that I should consider HOW THIS WOULD REFLECT ON ME!</p>
<p>It was an obvious threat.  Seeing that NOBODY wanted to hear this, I did not pursue it, and she got away with her theft.</p>
<p>On another occasion, another (black) woman in payroll took over and filled in (unofficially, and on her own) for the supervisor who had left. There began to be many things about her that made me suspicious. When I tried to address them to my superiors, nobody wanted to hear. They wanted to leave well enough alone.</p>
<p>Nothing was done about her.   It much later turned out, when she eventually came to the attention of law enforcement, that she was a crack addict and a member of a forgery ring which had stolen HUNDREDS of city checks and cashed them throough  her account. I learned of this from an attorney at headquarters, after she had already vanished mysteriously  from the job. The detectives were looking for her!</p>
<p>A year later, she was found, arrested, and sent to prison.  I felt vindicated (although never given credit). When I had tried to call attention to her suspicious behavior, I was viewed as a troublemaker, and no one wanted to hear it.  I was rocking the boat! </p>
<p>Yes, management are nine-tenths a bunch of terrified wimps who are protecting their own precious jobs and desperately afraid of any trouble with &#8220;minorities&#8221;.  If you call attention to a problem, YOU are seen as the problem.</p>
<p>This is just  one more way in which minorities are considered irreproachable. Even when they&rsquo;re thieves, you can&rsquo;t say so.  Just one more price we have to pay for having them among us.</p>

		<p>All the darker skin people have whitey on the run - really. Wish whites wouldn&rsquo;t always back down when there&rsquo;s a stupid complaint. If they don&rsquo;t like a white person saying &#8220;mexican&#8221;, it needs to be said over and over again. Mexican, Mexican, Mexican! OK, I said it. Now what?  </p>

		<p>40 years ago a black thug from Oakland  Ca. raped a college student in the town right across the city boundary, Berkely.  She was screaming.  Police in their car heard her.  The 2 white male officers (remember this was 40 years ago when police were still competent White men) actually had to pull the creature off his victim because he had not yet;what&rsquo;s a delicate way to say this? had not yet completed his objective and he refused to get off her when ordered by the officers.</p>
<p>The thug had a long record of rapes and other violence.  Yet the Police chief of Berkely had to go on Television and publicly apologize for the fact that his officers had used &#8220;improper force&#8221; in dragging the thug off his victim.</p>
<p>The White liberals of Berkely were anti police as much as the usual black poverty pimp preachers and activists.</p>

		<p>In other words whites must apologize for being born white and having 2 white parents and an evil wicked white ancestry who came to America and stole the innocent redman land and brought diseases to him to kill off millions and then brought the innocent slaves here to be beated whipped hanged and the black females raped 24/7/365 by the white masters. </p>
<p>We must blame whiteness and all its evil on white man religion who created white supremacy and have exploited the non-whites for thousands and thousands of years.</p>
<p>Yes whites need to give everything they have to the non-whites on earth whom they have stolen off for all those years while killing off them off the in process not allowing them to to become educated in order to become rich famous and powerfull.<br>
White man has been holding them down for all these eons of time and must be guilty for all his evil. </p>
<p>Whites must apologize for that white God and white Book too who obviously showed favoritism. White is evil. All white females must be raped since we know all the black ones were raped for 500 yrs. </p>
<p>Black males have a perfect right to rape white females steal from whites rob them assault them and take whatever they want because they stole it all off the backs of the black and non-white races. </p>

		<p>I survived thirty years in a government job much like his, by keeping my mouth shut and my opinions strictly to myself. I NEVER used racial terms, told harmless racial jokes, or even engaged in conversation about race - even when it was entirely innocent and others around me were doing it. I would prefer to leave the room. I treated all conversation about race like the plague. They got nothing out of me.</p>
<p>Thus, I kept out of trouble and I was a survivor. I never had anything to have to apologize for.<br>

		<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m almost at a loss for words over the un-necessary public outcry for such a benign event as uttering &#8220;Mexican&#8221; in the description of a suspect, and then the severe penalty meted out for the said ethnic &#8220;slur&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Recently, this same police department allowed <a href="https://elliotlakenews.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/trigger-happy-cop-or-not/" rel="nofollow"><b>another Seattle cop</b></a> to simply quit the job after shooting to death, a <i>Native Indian</i> pedestrian, with five bullets last August. The shooting was ruled unjustified by their Firearms Review Board, yet the cop resigned without charges. </p>

<p>I agree Bobster!   He says, &#8220;Thus, I kept out of trouble and I was a survivor.&#8221;  WHAT?</p>
<p>My question to him is, what makes him think he is a survivor? The taxpayer money he gets for retiring and all the benefits?  He may have &#8220;survived&#8221; by keeping his mouth shut, thereby adding to the problem of Whitey &#8220;not offending&#8221; anyone and now his and our race see little hope of ever surviving as a RACE! Hope his monthly check makes him feel better. I &#8220;left&#8221; my job FOR so-called &#8220;offensive&#8221; racial talk. But I can sleep at night knowing I was RIGHT and they were WRONG. </p>

<p>Apologize for WHAT?  Make amends for WHAT?  For not telling smart-alec racial jokes, insulting people, and getting into idle &#8220;conversations&#8221; about race that did not concern me?</p>
<p>What good would that have done? Where would be the benefit?<br>
The only thing accomplished would be my firing.</p>
<p>I hope you re-think your ill-considered  comment. It&rsquo;s so easy to talk when you&rsquo;re not the one on the spot!  I think you have put a great deal more into this than I ever wrote.</p>
<p>My point was that I NEVER used racial terms at work. Even if I had spoken out rashly  and made crude racial wise-cracks, there was NOTHING  that I was in any position to control AS FAR AS POLICY.   Really, insulting people accomplishes nothing  (except one&rsquo;s own impoverishment).<br>

<p><br>
Bobster, I think  we are coming to some agreement on this. Yes, you should speak out when you see WRONGS being committed, things on which you could have some influence. Or to DEFEND your own kind (although few of them would do the same for you!)   And yes, few of your co-workers, even whites,  will openly dare to agree with you. Your supervisors will be even worse.</p>
<p>But  idle conversation is something else.  I made a practice  of never discussing  (conversationally)  politics, religion, or race.  You never know what enemies you&rsquo;ll make, without even knowing it. My own views, if known,  would have put me at the top of the firing list.</p>
<p>Gratuitous  racial JOKES or ETHNIC TERMS could be very offensive to some thin-skinned individuals,  although seemingly quite harmless to others. You never know.</p>
<p>And you have to step particularly carefully when your agency is 4/5 non-white, and you the white one,  are perceived as the automatic bad guy even before you open your mouth. It&rsquo;s  assumed that you&rsquo;re &#8220;racisss&#8221; and  &#8220;prejudisss&#8221; because you&rsquo;re white.   Was your place that bad?  Being an Anglo myself made it worse.  I was not even one in twenty, maybe one in fifty. There was no one around like me, and fewer who would support me. I would be tossed to the wolves,  and the slightest peep out of me would have been pounced on for an EEO complaint. As I was in an envied and resented position, some people were just waiting for that chance.   They were drooling for it! I outwitted them and outlasted them by giving them NOTHING to use against me. The joke was on them, and I&rsquo;m the one laughing now. <br>

		<p>There is something much worse that this. A majority of government<br>
contracts are now set asides, whites need not apply.  We<br>
recently wrote the spec for a federal gov. project only to<br>
find out (after the bid was released) that an all white small<br>
business (ours) is disqualified.  This in Federal, State, and<br>
Local govenment contracts if any Federal Funding attached. I <br>
am meeting with my congressmen to tell him that I am going<br>
to refuse to file federal income tax to fund my own economic<br>
extinction.  We are still 70 percent or so of the general<br>
population still, are we not ? If we do not unite as a race and<br>
become politically active and use our power, we are going to<br>
be exterminated.  We must become as activist and cohesive as<br>
other pressure groups are we are going to get aced out of own<br>
own country, land, and culture. I am dead serious. Not a fanatic.<br>
I see the pattern. </p>
