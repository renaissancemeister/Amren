			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News, May 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a West Vancouver woman accused of keeping a slave.</p>
<p>The Crown laid one charge of human trafficking and a charge of human smuggling against the woman after investigating a report from a 21-year-old female who was allegedly recruited from Africa with a promise of a job in a West Vancouver hair salon, said RCMP Const. Michael McLaughlin.</p>
<p>&#8220;When she got here the reality was very different,&#8221; McLaughlin said Monday. &#8220;She was working up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week in a private home. She wasn&rsquo;t paid. Her identity [papers] and passport were kept by the owner of the home and she wasn&rsquo;t getting enough food.&#8221;</p>
<p>McLaughlin said the woman was fed table scraps, had to wash the cars of people who came to visit the house and wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go to bed until the owners had retired.</p>
<p>The young woman left the home in June 2009 after living there for one year and made her way to a women&rsquo;s shelter, police said.</p>
<p>Such charges rare</p>
<p>The shelter was able to provide immediate support for her while an RCMP human trafficking team started its investigation with help from West Vancouver Police, said McLaughlin.</p>
<p>Charged is West Vancouver resident Mumtaz Ladha.</p>
<p>McLaughlin said Ladha, 55, is not currently at her residence, prompting the warrant for her arrest.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s allegations have not been proven in court.</p>
<p>McLaughlin said it&rsquo;s only the second time such charges have been laid in B.C.</p>

		<p>She may have treated her African slave woman poorly, but by bringing her over here in the first place, she guaranteed this woman permanent residence in Canada. I&rsquo;m sure the slave woman will never be deported, even though she really has no business being in this country.<br/>

		<p>It&rsquo;s probably a bunch of bull. She probably came to work at first, but then figured out that if she came up with a sob story she could hit the welfare jackpot.</p>

		<p>No surprise that this is coming from the Muslims.  Like Ann Coulter said if there&rsquo;s an article called Muslim Bites Dog it&rsquo;s still not news.  The whole religion is predicated on slavery and submission so it conditions their minds towards submission of anyone that it gets it&rsquo;s grip on.</p>

		<p>It is pathetic how they beat Southerners over the head about slavery when it was officially ended here 150 years ago and then bury stories like this one on some back page if they are covered at all. I realize that this story comes out of Canada but stuff like this is all too common here in the US as well. I would also bet money that almost every person in the US that has been convicted or charged with &#8220;slavery&#8221; was not born here. </p>

The Arab slave trade lasted several centuries longer than the European slave trade. It was eventually ended by European military action. Arab slave traders usually castrated male slaves. Many of these slaves were Europeans. </p>

		<p>This is not the first such story I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Another I recall included stories of multiple young women &#8216;recruited&rsquo; from a single village by an &#8216;Auntie&rsquo; like character who faked paperwork for a fostered education visa and then set these 14-19 year olds to slaving in a seedy beauty salon because apparently black women need a lot of maintenance with braided hair.</p>
<p>Funny thing is.</p>
<p>There is never any mention of a truancy officer check brought on by adult customers at the salon or parental outrage from the home country when their daughter didn&rsquo;t check in again, _ever_.</p>
<p>Even though &#8216;Auntie&rsquo; had been raiding villages in this region for (sold as chatttel IMO) &#8216;slaves&rsquo; the better part of two decades.</p>
<p>Point Being:  They do not care about themselves.  This is **expected** behavior.  If they will not stand up for their own, even as nuclear family members, why should we?</p>
<p>Not.  Our.  Problem.</p>
