<h1>&#8220;Black Women Attractiveness&#8221; Study Exposes Racism in Evolutionary Psychology</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charing Ball, Atlanta Post, May 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>[Editor: A copy of the original post which is the subject of this article can be found here and <a href="http://www.visajourney.com/forums/topic/310296-psychology-today-published-this-article-and-then-pulled-it-did-they-do-the-right-thing/" target="attractive" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>here.</b></a>]</p>
<p><br/>
The black blogosphere went H.A.M. yesterday over a post written in Psychology Today entitled &#8220;Why Are Black Women Less Physically Attractive Than Other Women?&#8221; The post, which was penned by pseudo-evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics, contains a lot of inflammatory subjective &#8220;science&#8221; that basically trashes black women.</p>
<p>In the piece, Kanazawa polls a bunch of his friends, who also hate black women, and (surprise, surprise) discovers that black women are statistically far less attractive than white, Asian and Native American women. Then he &#8220;analyzes&#8221; his data, determining that &#8220;Black women are on average much heavier than nonblack women.&#8221; Moreover, &#8220;Black women are still less physically attractive than nonblack women net of BMI and intelligence. Net of intelligence, black men are significantly more physically attractive than nonblack men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kanazawa concludes his findings with this thoughtless piece of subjectivity: &#8220;The only thing I can think of that might potentially explain the lower average level of physical attractiveness among black women is testosterone. Africans on average have higher levels of testosterone than other races, and testosterone, being an androgen (male hormone), affects the physical attractiveness of men and women differently. Men with higher levels of testosterone have more masculine features and are therefore more physically attractive. In contrast, women with higher levels of testosterone also have more masculine features and are therefore less physically attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After a mid-morning email blitz from disgruntled black women (and the men that love them) everywhere, Psychology Today pulled the piece. However, thanks to the infinite powers of the Internet, Kanazawa&rsquo;s bigoted douchebaggery lives on for eternity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just not women that Kanazawa seems to degrade with his moronic theorizing. He has also claimed there is a link between lower average IQ and poverty in Africa. Unfortunately, Kanazawa, among others, is allowed to play up these baseless hypotheses about the human condition thanks in part to evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology is becoming increasingly popular and influential on popular culture, and you are often more likely to see articles from this perspective in publications like Psychology Today.</p>

		<p>The reason that psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa concluded that black women are unattractive is that they are unattractive.   <br/>
 <br/>
Beside the fact that most of them are fat   &mdash;   huge   &mdash;   most have fat lips, flat noses, and hair not even a bald man would envy.  Couple those looks with their loud obnoxious behavior, crude manners, and filthy language and it&rsquo;s no wonder their last on the date list.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;black men are significantly more physically attractive than nonblack men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the author got that idea.  Aside from some white women who decide to &#8220;go black,&#8221; the vast majority of white women cringe at the thought of being touched by a black man.</p>

<p>What is more surprising that instead of name calling the African woman doesn&rsquo;t even support her case.</p>

		<p>This is probably the ultimate example of unspeakable truth in our society, even more so than black IQ. Ask a sample of men and 90% of them, if they are being honest, will confirm what Kanazawa is saying. </p>
<p>And why is Kanazawa a &#8220;pseudo&#8221; evolutionary psychologist? He holds a pHD. He is a faculty member at the London School of Economics. Sounds pretty legit to me. </p>

Do you have EYES?<br/>
Use them.<br/>
Even their own kind don&rsquo;t want them, prefering heavyset blonde females?</p>

		<p>Whites need to work harder to invent more products for black females to ecome attractive to their black male including plastic surgery and physical exercise.</p>
<p>Blacks need to be trained once this is done to stay with their black female counterpart and refrain from animalistic tendancies. </p>
<p>Another answer would be to try to bring out the homosexual tendancies for the same sex with these black males who all have the perv genetics in order to keep them with their own gender and away from the white female who has been hopelessly brainwashed in todays pc society.</p>

		<p>Before the bashing of black women begins, I have a question for those who agree with Kanazawa&rsquo;s theory about testosterone and female attractiveness.  Just to reiterate,  Kanazawa speculates that females with lower amounts of testosterone have less masculine facial features and are more attractive because of that.  Does that mean that East Asian women are the most attractive? </p>

		<p>The observatione in the original piece are not terribly surprising; one&rsquo;s own empirical observations count for much in this instance.</p>
<p>Generally, they are far more masculinoid, aggressive an pushy than would generally be the case. They are designed to compete with a massively hyper-masculinised counterpart, therefore it seems reasonable that they would be rather more masculine than the males of other races.</p>
<p>As regards the allegations of being &#8216;heavier&rsquo;, well I&rsquo;m afraid that the evidence of the senses speaks volumes and I say that without judgemental reference to dietary (not to metnion quantity) choices that are unerringly made.</p>

		<p>Yep, anything that deviates from the &#8220;norm&#8221;, must be exposed as nothing but racism, pure and simple. The norm being that we are all equal in all respects. Intelligence, common sense, ambition, work ethic, proneness to criminal behavior and yes, even physical beauty. Even the slightest hint that we aren&rsquo;t all carbon copies of one another is cause for us to be subject to total ruination, as Mr Kanazawa is about to learn. </p>
<p>And so we are supposed to pretend when we see a black woman of average physical beauty, if that, crowned as a beauty queen, usually with 2 legitimately beautiful White women as her runners up. Pretend that the black is astoundingly beautiful and was rightfully chosen as the winner. </p>
<p>The only problem is, I dont believe that. And IMO, MOST others dont believe it either. Even blacks. They may act like the black woman deserved to win, but they have eyes too. They see 2 beautiful White women standing next to an average looking black woman. And they too have to pretend. Its all just a game.</p>

		<p>I have always known that black women are less attractive physically than white women because black women have more testosterone.  Asian men are less attractive than white men for the same reason.</p>
<p>Tyra Banks is trying to brainwash people with her B.I.O. campaign (beauty on the inside and out) and make adolescents feel guilty for knowing the truth about themselves.  She is fighting a losing battle against evolution.</p>
<p>What I find curious is that black women have so many black girls out of wedlock.  They know how difficult it was for them to feel beautiful growing up and for them to find suitable mates, and they know that their hair is course and difficult to make look presentable in public, without a significant amount of pain and a significant investment in money.  But they irresponsibly bring other black females into the world who will have to endure the same thing.  They should just adopt, and adopt when they are older and more responsible emotionally and financially.</p>

She keeps using the word pseudo in describing scinece and scientists, yet does not seem capable of applying the same term to her less than stellar writing abilities and non-intellectual approach to matters.</p>

		<p>This is typical emotive reasoning. The author does not use one single scientific fact to refute the premise. And that part about &#8220;black men are &#8216;significantly&rsquo; more attractive than non-black men&#8221; - I am just speechless! I believe there was an article on Amren a few years back regarding the scientific approach to beauty. The symmetry of the facial features, textures of skin, etc. all contributed to what a vast majority of people consider &#8220;attractive.&#8221;<br/>
I recall an episode of the Twilight Zone where the tables were turned on what is beautiful. It was a long time ago when I watched, but I believe the setting was a world where everyone was extremely ugly and they were going to perform &#8220;corrective surgery&#8221; on a beautiful woman to make her &#8220;normal.&#8221; <br/>
We are in a completely upside down world where &#8220;rappers&#8221; are considered poets, Cop killers are considered &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221;, and &#8220;Afro-Engineering&#8221; is a serious endeavor instead of a pejorative! Gotta love that accidentally prophetic movie Idiocracy!</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m surprised the author didn&rsquo;t accuse Kanazawa of living &#8220;in your mother&rsquo;s basement, in your shorts,&#8221; as that&rsquo;s a favorite insult hurled by those who have been bested in an argument on the Internet.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;d say Mr. Kanazawa has some valid arguments. Take a good look at Whoopi Goldberg, for instance, and tell me you&rsquo;ve ever seen an uglier woman, of any color. She is not only ugly enough to make one shudder, and masculine looking, but she wears atrocious clothes. &#8220;Black is beautiful?&#8221; Ha! Maybe sometimes, but not in her case.</p>
<p> As a matter of fact, though I disapprove of miscegenation, black women who have an admixture of White or Asian blood are, on average, much more attractive than the undiluted kind.</p>
<p> And if Mr. Kanazawa is wrong, why do so many black men routinely chase after White women, instead of their own kind? </p>

		<p>Only half in jest, I&rsquo;ve been working on a pseudo-scientific theory of my own. Estimating the US population at 300 million and breaking it down ethnically by percentage, I&rsquo;ve concluded that roughly one third of the US population is composed of incorrigibly antisocial people who belong in jail if they aren&rsquo;t already there.</p>
<p>Of the estimated incorrigible 102 million, roughly one third are white, one fourth are hispanic, and one fifth are black. You&rsquo;ll arrive at similar figures if you operate on the presumption that the incorrigibility factor is present in 20% of whites, 50% of hispanics, and 80% of blacks. The remainder of the incorrigibles is composed of &#8220;Others,&#8221; which runs the gamut from radical Islamists to covertly hostile East Asians.</p>
<p>If Kanazawa&rsquo;s research is good enough for Psychology Today, I would think mine should have its place as well!</p>

		<p>This is exactly what so many posters on AmRen are talking about when they say that blacks need to have thick skin. I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about Kanazawa as a scientist, but I do know that if you google his name, he is quite controversial. Good. The blogosphere needs more like him, taking shots at &#8220;black pride&#8221; &amp; such. It&rsquo;s a good thing the guy is Asian, because a White guy would be cleaning public restrooms if he wrote a piece like this. Also who is this Charing Ball? Perhaps someone who&rsquo;s made it from AA to be a &#8220;journalist&#8221; these days? And doesn&rsquo;t look at race science? But probably cuts down Whites at every opportunity.</p>

		<p>Granted Kanazawa&rsquo;s hypothesis that higher levels of testosterone  in black women may be the reason for the results of his study is speculation.  However it is speculation based on the facts he knows. The author of the piece simply dismisses scientific method and produced no evidence that his results are wrong or his study was flawed.   Additionally she is apparently unaware of the many studies that link lower IQ&rsquo;s to poverty that don&rsquo;t even mention race.  Philip K. Dick once wrote &ldquo;Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn&rsquo;t go away&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m surprised that Psychology Today actually published Kanazawa&rsquo;s findings. </p>

		<p>This is a very amusing piece.  My wife the other day commented that seeing a group of white people evokes no emotional reaction.  However, she noted that seeing a group of blacks immediately places her on a heightened state of awareness out of concerns for safety.

		<p>A broad nose, thick lips, dusky skin, sloping forehead, prognathism, masculine features, nappy hair, and strong brow is breathtakingly beautiful on a woman.  Black women are the epitome of femininity.  How could anyone think differently?</p>

		<p>But seriously, folks&hellip;</p>
<p>It is literally impossible to find a group of people who, when polled, will list African women as the most beautiful or anywhere near the top.  This includes African men!!!!</p>
<p>All the objective data (dating, dating websites, personal ads, marriage rates, miscegenation rates) points to the same conclusion: African women are the least-preferred of the females.  This is irrefutable.</p>
<p>As far as subjective data&hellip;Good Lord, just look around, or ask somebody.  </p>
<p>For a real hearty laugh, scroll through the covers of &#8220;African&#8221; magazines like Jet, Ebony, etc.  You can count on one hand how many 100% African women make the covers!  They&rsquo;re virtually ALL mulatto with White blood mixed in!</p>
<p>Even the Afro-centric community implicitly admits that African women are only beautiful when they are diluted with White blood.  Show me a famous African woman model or beauty figure, and unless it&rsquo;s the &#8220;shock value&#8221; dark-as-night six-foot-tall tribeswoman on the runway, it is ALWAYS a cafe-colored mulatto.  Tyra Banks, Beyonce Knowles, Whitney Houston, Oprah, Gail: do these women look 100% African to you?  Of course they aren&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>It is more than testosterone.  Their physiognomy is much more &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; than that of most Europeans or East Asians.  African hair isn&rsquo;t very nice, either.  It doesn&rsquo;t have the silkiness of Eurasian hair.  The whole package is less than appealing.  But is it really our issue?  If we lived separate would it matter?  International trade does not depend on integration.  I can buy from Gary the Grocer without having Gary and his family living with me.</p>
<p>I also notice that Mr. Kanazawa seems to feel that East Asians are a tad less creative than whites.  Perhaps East Asians are less individualistic but better behaved?  His conclusions are at least based on non-inflammatory observations, his critic can only come back with the witty retort &ldquo;bigoted douchebaggery &ldquo;.</p>

The channel E! ran an ad for a new reality show which will feature the rapper &#8220;Ice Tea&#8221; and his blonde spouse. So black women are really no less attractive than females of other races? Perhaps Charing Ball can enlighten us in her next piece as to why so many black men become involved with women from other races. I&rsquo;d love to know Ms. Ball, especially since it can&rsquo;t be because of the lower &#8220;Average IQ&#8221; of Africans as suggested by the &#8220;pseudo-evolutionary psychologist&#8221; Kanazawa. <br/>

<p>Pay particular attention to the faces of black security guards. They are fully retentive of their afrovoodoo features, and very, very black, coal black, so black they&rsquo;re blue.  Drive through rich White neighborhoods around 4 pm and see the faces of the black maids waiting for the bus. Fully African, pure, undiluted African.  Not what Arnold Schwartzie jumped in his broom closet ten years ago.</p>
<p>You see diluted yellow cast afros mostly in education, religion, higher levels of government, and some entertainment.

		<p>Here you have posters who more than likely are against interracial relationship agreeing with the article than Black<br/>
women are less attractive than other women. Yet many frown<br/>
when they see black men with white women. In addition they <br/>
tend to believe that many black women  are,also, against black<br/>
men dating other women. So aren&rsquo;t they given black men more reason to date the women they dont want black men to date? I believe it is a sign of weakness of any group to focus on the appearance of other racial group.  <br/>
And the evidence of that weakness is rapid change which is occuring in the west which many here object to but are helpless<br/>
in stopping it. For example, in about 30 years this country<br/>
will be mostly minority. And according to an article  <br/>
minority will be majority in the United Kingdom in around 2065.<br/>
A poster on another site even wrote that in 100 years<br/>
the US will be like any country in<br/>
South America  and Europe will be like Lebanon. </p>
<p>The IMF recently projected that China gdp will surpass the <br/>
United States in 2016(purchasing power parity).</p>
<p>Many are constantly putting down black women appearance but<br/>
cant explain why 1/3 of black women in the United Kingdom<br/>
are in relationship with  white men and 50 percent of <br/>
black men are in relationship with white women in the same <br/>
country. <br/>
It seems that when people cant affect the change that is <br/>
occuring in this country they focus on unimportant issue.</p>

<p>But if that is strictly true then why doesn&rsquo;t one see more mixed couples that are black man &amp; asian woman??? In fact, one almost never sees that combination. This suggests that rather than the highest or lowest T-level being the most attractive that there is actually an optimum T-level that is a little higher for men and a little lower for women without necessarily being the highest or the lowest.</p>

For example, when the men and women are rated according to their attractiveness by interviewers, the racial composition of the interviewers themselves need to be taken into account. There is no mention of that vital piece of data anywhere in that post. Without that, the paper has no credibility. Good that Psychology Today pulled the article, hopefully not for political correctness, but for scientific incompetence.</p>

<p>I think the problem is not so much that they are indeed uglier, which they aren&rsquo;t, but that for some reason black males want white females. So the black female has to look at herself and deem herself less attractive.  </p>

		<p>People here have got to make a distinction between overall attractiveness of the races, and you see in his graphs that if you take all three graphs then white men win (by a small margin).</p>
<p>However, if you look at each IQ level, black men are de facto more attractive. But since the IQ differences are what they are, this is mostly nullified in practice.</p>
<p>As Donna has stated, and that I&rsquo;ve seen myself, black men are the fittest of all men. Black men are also aggressive and have a very high self-esteem(just like black women, according to the research).</p>
<p>Women like fit, confident men. Women don&rsquo;t like idiots, but a lot of average white girls with IQs of around 96 or 98 won&rsquo;t care if their man has an IQ of 85(in part because it&rsquo;s been shown that blacks hold up better at lower levels of IQ).</p>
<p>Women like aggressive, confident men and at their IQ level, black men are disproportionate at those qualities. That&rsquo;s just a fact of life. It just so happens that there are relatively few black men at IQs of 110 and upwards, which is why most IR marriages are in the lower socioeconomic sectors and quite rare in the highest stratosphere.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that black men can be toyboys for white women to exploit, and then thrown away for the next stud to use. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why this is controversial, perhaps it&rsquo;s a nagging insecurity on the part of some men here. Remember, blacks gotta have *something* going for them, as they got the worst lot in life of all races from the intelligence perspective, arguably the most important factor for a people. So they got sexual and athletic prowess instead. </p>
<p>I think whites got the best package all-round. We&rsquo;re more attractive and more aggressive than asians, yet have high IQs. We&rsquo;re a very balanced people. Blacks are off one extreme and asians are on the other(especially asian men).</p>

		<p>&#8220;Uhhh, because rape is not about attraction, it`s about abuse hatred, disgust and humilation!! Which kind of proves the mans point you were disdaining…&#8221;</p>
<p>So black men who rape women of other races (say for instance white women) are not attracted to their victims at all; rather they only rape white women because they are disgusted by their looks and want to humiliate them. </p>

		<p>The black population is very large so someone found black women  attractive.  However what always puzzles me is why black women believe they are entitled to have children whether they can properly care for them or not.  Contrast that to the many white women who do not marry nor have children because they are not a &#8220;catch.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The truth of the matter is that blacks tend to be more robust all the way around. They are a more primitive group of people where physical endurance was more important than either looks or brains. </p>
<p>Sure black men tend to have more muscle mass but blacks were not into philosophy thousands of years ago. </p>
<p>If black men still depended on having some female farm the land so as to make a living for them and all their children then black women would probably start looking much better to black men. </p>
<p>White people stopped hitching their women to the plow when they domesticated draft animals and this meant that a man could choose a mate for different reasons. If you can wait a few thousand years then black women will start to look better. </p>

		<p>At #25, I stand guilty of sloppy scholarship and not checking my final figures. The actual percentages of the incorrigible 102 million are:</p>
<p>33% White<br/>
30% African American<br/>
25% Hispanic<br/>
12% Other</p>
<p>Thought the figure seemed a bit low for AA&rsquo;s. What this means is that, in raw numbers, there actually are slightly more white antisocial incorrigibles than black, though blacks are very much more likely to be incorrigible.</p>
<p>The demographics of a specific region affect the tendencies, of course. In my area for example, the Crime Watch section of the newspaper is about 80% &#8220;suspect described as hispanic.&#8221;</p>

		<p>#66 Tim, Rape is most certainly about sex and it&rsquo;s relative unavailability. The myth that rape is about power has been brought about by rapist accounts years after their attacks and after repeated &#8220;treatment&#8221; (brainwashing.) There was also a book by some radical feminist in the mid 1970s that first mentioned the &#8220;rape is about power&#8221; bit. When they&rsquo;re first captured, most rapists admit the lady looked nice or they were desperate for sex or something. It&rsquo;s almost always about sex and the rapists inability to control his urges. The story he referenced is hardly established and a poor example for a poor point. </p>

		<p>If you look at pictures of Oprah when she was in her 20s, you can see that she has had enormous amounts of plastic surgery and she is still ugly.  The funniest Oprah story is about her winning the title &#8220;Miss Black Teenage Memphis&#8221;  She was the only contestant.</p>
<p>I knew a woman who participated in those black beauty contests.  She was thin, well dressed, well behaved and had a face that was neither plain nor pretty.  It was a monstrous rip off.  The contestants or their parents paid enormous fees to participate.  The winners got the title but the financial benefits were far less that what the contestant paid to join the pageant.</p>
<p>The organizers, typical non profit poverty preacher community organizer pimps, got money from 20 to 30 contestants and paid the winner and 2 runner ups about 1/4 of what the winner and runner ups paid to participate.</p>
<p>Organizers must have made about a 30 thousand percent profit.</p>

<p>____________________</p>
<p>Rape can be about many things, many motives.  It is about the urge to abuse, overpower, degrade, control, dominate. Yes, and to humiliate, especially someone who is hated and envied&hellip; or who represents a hated, envied group.</p>
<p>I recall that when the Congolese rebels, some years ago, overpowered a Belgian military base, they fought over who would get the &#8220;honor&#8221; to be first to rape the general&rsquo;s wife   &mdash;  - although she was the oldest and least attractive of the officer&rsquo;s wives. This was not about attraction! </p>
<p>It was about showing who was boss. It&rsquo;s about showing who takes advantage of whom;  who is in control and who is not.</p>
<p>With blacks, there is also a large element of racial &#8220;revenge&#8221;. It can sometimes be about attraction too.  But when an 18-year old rapes an 80-year old, don&rsquo;t tell me that is about attraction!</p>

<p>I am going to reply with inserts, to some of the statements in this somewhat incoherent post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you have posters who more than likely are against interracial relationship agreeing with the article than Black<br/>
women are less attractive than other women. Yet many frown<br/>
when they see black men with white women. In addition they<br/>
tend to believe that many black women are,also, against black<br/>
men dating other women. So aren&rsquo;t they given black men more reason to date the women they dont want black men to date? </p>
<p>&gt; I think you meant, &#8220;giving black men a reason..&#8221;  They don&rsquo;t need any reason or permission to do what they instinctively have always done.  Men the world over are most often attracted, drawn to fairer, lighter haired, blue eyed (or lighter than dark brown eyed) women, especially successful dark men.  You think that this supplies the logic for the justification for black men to seek out white women.  Again, no sense here.  It is about conservation of a species of humanity, not some sort of Marxist motivated rationality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is a sign of weakness of any group to focus on the appearance of other racial group.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Yet, EVERYONE does it, including you, otherwise, you would have no comment at all!  Oh, do you mean that everyone ought to take the other on character?  Well, it turns out that color and culture can be relied upon for behavior, and the evidence of this is overwhelming.  Again, you are trying to invoke a Marxist egalitarian rationale to all of humankind as if there was only one race.  We wouldn&rsquo;t have any discussion on any of this if that were so, and using it to destroy differences where race is concerned comes down to genocide.</p>
<p><br/>
&#8220;And the evidence of that weakness is rapid change which is occuring in the west which many here object to but are helpless<br/>
in stopping it. For example, in about 30 years this country<br/>
will be mostly minority. And according to an article<br/>
minority will be majority in the United Kingdom in around 2065.<br/>
A poster on another site even wrote that in 100 years<br/>
the US will be like any country in<br/>
South America and Europe will be like Lebanon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I think people posting here represent many more who do not want to go along with these projections.  Nothing is inevitable.  Constantly proclaiming this as done is only another tactic aimed at causing it.  Anything could happen in the next 50 years that could end up presenting a very different outcome.  Anyway, the people who resist this are courageous to do so and the lest sheep-like of humanity and therefore the most fit to survive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IMF recently projected that China gdp will surpass the<br/>
United States in 2016(purchasing power parity).&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;The IMF is not &#8220;God.&#8221;  Their leader certainly has illustrated that they are quite fallible as judges in selecting their leaders, if not in their processes, and their history is riddled with functional misjudgments.  If China would buy as many things from us as we do from them, it would make the U.S. stronger.  China can not go on only selling to the world.  They cannot afford to have either the U.S. or Europe collapse financially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many are constantly putting down black women appearance but<br/>
cant explain why 1/3 of black women in the United Kingdom<br/>
are in relationship with white men and 50 percent of<br/>
black men are in relationship with white women in the same<br/>
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I can.  First, it is not the majority of whites.  Second, it is due to an ongoing focus on Africa as a paradise.  Even Prince William has an ongoing program that seems to focus him more on Africa than his own nation.  Many British people have given up on England and are moving out, while their government fills it up with Africans and Arabs.  To cope with it, some natives, who are legally prevented from doing anything about it anyway, resign themselves to it and have simply given in.  It used to be called, &#8220;going native,&#8221; and it was viewed as the ultimate in moral and ethical weakness - to give oneself over to the base attraction of the primitive.  Britain appears to be sick with it.  It is a sign of a dying nation.  But the whole place will implode soon, so IMF projections are a bit too simple in assuming that the replacement population will function and act like the old Anglo-Saxon, White British population of the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that when people cant affect the change that is<br/>
occuring in this country they focus on unimportant issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; The reason to focus on this issue is exactly to prevent it from changing us, or at least preventing its full realization.  AT some point, the white populations of the world will realize that they are being eliminated by plan.  Many already know this.  The question is whether they will fight or not.  That is one of the reasons that issues like this are important.</p>
<p>&gt; People like you just want us to give up, give in, like a rapist whispering into his victim&rsquo;s ear, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t resist me, you might even like it.&#8221;  No, we will resist.  We don&rsquo;t have to like it, or pretend to.</p>

		<p>a while ago a couple of Chinese men on AmRen strongly disagreed with me when I stated if Chinese men have no choice but choosing between a typical black woman who grew up in North America and a muslim woman who grew up in a predominantly muslim country he should choose the North American woman </p>
<p>that was because at least in Canada the muslim women look almost identical to African Canadian women.  The skin tones and basic facial structures are the same.  Most of the time the only way for me to tell if a woman is a muslim or a non-muslim is the burka.  If a muslim woman takes off her burka I won&rsquo;t be able to tell.</p>

<p>Another thing that will eventually hurt China is that they can&rsquo;t run their game of &#8220;The Yuan is worth what we say it&rsquo;s worth&#8221; forever.  Something will happen to force its valuation on the international currency market upward.  (Especially against US$ and UK£ which are slowly sinking).  And once it does, prices at Wal*Martinez double overnight, and that&rsquo;s just the beginning.  Americans can&rsquo;t afford to buy as much China-made junk.  So guess what happens to China&rsquo;s (largely Potemkin) economy?</p>
<p>Even if their GDP did surpass ours by 2016, so what?  They&rsquo;ve got 1.3 billion people.  We&rsquo;ve got 300 million.  Their GDP per capita on average would still be way lower, and because most average Chinese workers don&rsquo;t realize much of the manufacturing profits, the Chinese *median* GDP per capita will still be even lower than that.</p>

		<p>Much of this &#8220;theorizing&#8221; (using that term loosely) has been around for years.  The convicted rapist, fugitive, then right-wing capitalist Eldridge Cleaver wrote about it in &#8220;Soul on Ice&#8221; back in the late sixties.  He only wrote about blacks and whites (no other races mentioned), and, if memory serves me correctly, described the black male as the &#8220;hyper-masculine menial&#8221;, but essentially powerless, the white woman as super-feminine (but also equally powerless), the black woman as asexual, and the white male as the &#8220;omnipotent administrator.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The moronic theorizing is coming from Charing Ball.  (And no points if you guessed correctly that Charing Ball is a black woman.)  There is ample reason to believe that Africa&rsquo;s miserable record of development has a lot to do with the astonishingly low IQs measured there.</p>
<p>As for the attractiveness of black women, well that&rsquo;s highly subjective.  In my own case I feel no attraction to black women.  Indeed, if other men felt as I do the race would go extinct due to an inability to breed.  I also note that successful black men commonly choose white woman as mates, so apparently they too find white woman to be more attractive.  OTOH it is very, very rare for a successful white man to choose a black woman as his wife.</p>
<p>I find the facial features of black woman to be less attractive than those of white or Asian women.  As for the personality, a woman who is loud, brassy, argumentative, and prone to issuing four letter words is a big turn off for me, and that is how way too many American black women are.  No wonder black men don&rsquo;t want to marry them.<br/>

This does not mean they are better, smarter, or better looking= they just think more of themselves than other races do.

<p>I have said here many times before that most black men are pretty scrawny, pathetic, out-of-shape specimens. Yes, there are a few who are in superb shape, but so are many white men. Even black kids are often obese.   The black superstar athlete that you see on TV and the nedwspapers is NOT your typical, average black man that you see on the street.</p>
<p>And yes, many impressionable whites (especially women) seem to confuse loudness and pushiness with self-confidence and masculinity! It&rsquo;s a shame they can&rsquo;t tell the difference.<br/>

		<p>The most attractive men of all races are tall, slim blue eyed blondes with pretty boy features.  Next most attractive are Asians with square, not round faces and very pronounced cheekbones.</p>
<p>Both types look best with longish hair.</p>
<p>Those are the gorgeous guy that make me just melt when I look at them.</p>
<p>Some black men are well built I suppose, but most men under 50 are.  Any attractiveness below the chin black men have is totally destroyed by their hair and their voices.  Those loud horrible voices babbling nonsense at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>When I either see or hear a black of either sex, even little kids I just want then to disappear.</p>
<p>But then my job requires me to be exposed to blacks more than most people.  I always tell people I am not prejudiced against blacks, I am post judiced against blacks.  </p>
<p>In other words, I formed my extremely negative views of blacks after years of exposure to blacks, &#8220;middle class&#8221; blacks in the workplace who are nothing more than jumped up ghetto trash.</p>

		<p>Um&hellip;Walker the Chinese guy (poster #86):</p>
<p>Since most Chinese men, similar to Muslim &#8216;men&rsquo;, base their &#8216;masculinity&rsquo; on oppressing, subjugating etc to obtain a perceived illusion of manhood, it&rsquo;s no surprise that you favour a typical Muslim woman who has no choice because she is brainwashed &amp; lives in an environment in which freedom is as plentiful as water on the Moon. </p>
<p>Most real men, especially White men I know, have a solid view of masculinity &amp; don&rsquo;t require their mates to be submissive slaves in order to elevate themselves to a false level of manhood. Their masculinity is earned, internalized &amp; understood, not taken from &#8220;status&#8221; gained when they marry &amp; sire villages children under a backward religion.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why smart, not necessarily academically educated, Asian women I know ALWAYS go for White men rather than their own &#8220;men&#8221;? Because they actually have personalities, can interact, feel &amp; love better, so they can please a worthy mate better?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really expect you to comprehend that notion of complementarity of course&hellip;</p>

<p>Very good point.<br/>
To be honest, I will not marry a German women ever for the very same reasons you told.<br/>
You don&rsquo;t know how many women over the age of 30 years I have seen who divorced for absolutely no reason even if they had kids.</p>
<p>I completely disagree with Muslims but I have to admit a Muslim guy was right when he said: &#8220;Western marriages are nothing more than a bad joke if so many end in divorces.&#8221;</p>

<p>How absolutely dense.  Because a lecherous old man lusts after anything he thinks he can rape and get away with and his target this time was a black woman you&rsquo;re making the leap that such an  action disproves what everybody can see with his own eyes that 99.9% of black women are not unattractive?</p>

<p>Smart by someone&rsquo;s standards, but they&rsquo;re certainly not attractive. I think the world-lowest rates of rape and murder and assault of women in East Asia certainly prove how sexist they are.</p>

		<p>I bought a magazine this afternoon and just read about a woman named Kaitlyn Wong.  She caught my attention when I read that she did her undergraduate in Psychology at one of the local universities in Toronto, York University.  I know a plenty of people who did undergraduates at York. </p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/PvURB" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/PvURB</a></p>
<p>http://goo.gl/0P0j2</p>
<p>Yes I think Kaitlyn is very very beautiful.  On the magazine I just bought today, it reads she is proud of both her Chinese and Irish ancestry.  I would love to meet her in person as well.  Hey why not she lives in Toronto</p>
<p>&#8220;back to the conversion part, well atheism by heart makes easy, i&rsquo;d just consider 5 times a day prostrating to mecca as some sort of yoga practice^^.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haha, well^^, I have been a devout Christian every minute of my life and likely that was another reason I felt girls raised in North America would be more compatible. </p>
<p>What else have I noticed lately&hellip;.</p>
<p>A South Korean guy that I have known for more than the past 10 years, just proposed to his Taiwanese girlfriend and she gave a response, and his facebook is filled with &#8220;Congratulations&#8221; now. </p>
<p>They have been dating for quite a while but I only asked him what his finacee&rsquo;s nationality was only a few days ago, because, nowadays, it can almost be a rude thing to ask which country one was born in.  I just knew she was not Korean, but was never sure exactly where, and learned she is from Taiwan only a few days ago.  As for me, I never find it offending when someone asks me where I was born in.  I was born in a port city in South Korea.  I do not see how it would ever offend me to ask me where I was born, but I still just try to be careful to others around me.</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/DJVZt</p>
<p>The very tall tower in the background is the CN Tower in Toronto.  That is one of the must-visit places in Toronto, Canada.  My assessment on his girl?  Cute.. very cute.</p>
<p>A Japanese girl I deeply respect and care about, named Emi, who volunteered to help serve warm dinner to seniors in Toronto with me every Tuesday evening while she was studying in Canada, she not only survived the natural disaster but shortly after the that she also received a marriage proposal from a Chinese Canadian man from British Columbia, which is a province in western Canada.  His name is Chih</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/uyxTt</p>
<p>Yes she is very beautiful.  She taught me a bit of Japanese and I was amazed how well she knew about Korea including the latest events in South Korea.  I asked her how her family members responded to their engagement and she told me they are very happy. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what else&hellip;  I recently started teaching Korean to a Chinese guy as a tutor because his dad has a company and his dad has a few business-level Korean clients, and he wants to help his dad communicate better with his Korean clients.  He and I have been close friends for quite a few years by now.  Something amusing I remember is, he and I were having a late lunch at a restaurant located on the 2nd floor of a building, and he noticed something out the window and immediately made a phone call.  What he saw was one of the employees at his dad&rsquo;s company goofing off at a coffee shop right across from the restaurant.  He asked why he was not working, and politely but firmly asked him to get back to work immediately. </p>
<p>http://goo.gl/jxuVF me and my mom.  I bought her a Nike golf glove for Mother&rsquo;s Day this year.  I am not a big fan of Nike but I decided that it would take too much time to look for a quality golf glove not designed by Nike and it would not be worth my time.  I could not afford to spend too much time shopping around that day.  She is very satisfied with the quality and absolutely loves it. </p>
<p>Thanks for listening to my babbling!!</p>

		<p>Black men more attractive?   I&rsquo;m sorry, but that&rsquo;s simply&hellip; stupid.  I don&rsquo;t have a very high opinion of my own attractiveness (which isn&rsquo;t surprising, as I&rsquo;m not black), but compared to your typical Tyrone and Jamal I&rsquo;m practically model material.  </p>
<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m curious about is this - he says that black men aren&rsquo;t as likely to be as obese/out of shape as other races.  Yet from what I know of obesity statistics, the poor have a much bigger problem with it than the middle-class/upper-class, and blacks are disproportionately poorer on a far greater scale than whites&hellip; you can see where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p>
<p>In short, I&rsquo;d love to see where he got that information from.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re talking about physical attributes of blacks and whites?</p>
<p>First Lady Michelle Obama is worried about &#8220;obesity,&#8221; especially adolescent obesity.  But every time I see a bunch of high school students, a big majority of the white men, white women and black men are almost nothing but skin and bones, who ought to make a bee line for the nearest weight room before they spontaneously disappear.  However, the one high school age demographic that does seem to have some weight issues are the black women.</p>
<p>So that begs the question   &mdash;   Is FLOTUS concerned about teenage obesity simply as a universal concern, or is she concerned about it basically because so many black women have weight issues?  I wouldn&rsquo;t blame her if that&rsquo;s why she was so concerned, because she too is a black woman.  I don&rsquo;t happen to appreciate her wanting to shove our 15-year old 100-pound white brethren on herbivorous diets, because obesity is not his problem.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how obese blacks are. I put this down to foreign aid if they live in Africa, and welfare if they live in the west. Let&rsquo;s slim them down by taking them off these fattening-up programs. That way we could afford lower taxes and better health care, too.</p>
