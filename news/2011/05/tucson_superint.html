<h1><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/tucson-superintendent-backs-down-from-plan-to-change-radical-curriculum/">Tucson Superintendent Backs Down From Plan to Change Radical Curriculum</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathon M. Seidl, The Blaze, May 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Tucson Unified School District superintendent in the middle of a push to have a radical Mexican-American studies class changed to an elective, has now backed down from his position, even going as far as to issue an apology. The change follows two wild demonstrations at consecutive school board meetings, one in which students chained themselves to desks, and another in which the riot police were called in.</p>
<p>Superintendent John Pedicone told local station KOLD-TV that he sent a letter to UNIDOS  &mdash;  the radical student group opposing the change  &mdash;  and the Mexican American Studies Community Advisory Board saying he has now advised the TUSD governing board to &#8220;table and not consider the resolution to make Mexican American Studies an elective.&#8221; (Quote is not Pedicone&rsquo;s, but rather KOLD&rsquo;s.)</p>
<p>Also contained in at least one of the letters is a promise that he won&rsquo;t recommend charges against those who were arrested during the rowdy protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We simply have to kind of bring that level of anxiety down to where we can begin to talk reasonably about this program, which we, which I think the district has said from the very beginning it supports,&#8221; Pedicone told KOLD. {snip}</p>
<p>In the letters, Pedicone told both groups that he is recommending the board refrain from voting on the plan until the State Department of Public Instruction rules whether the Mexican-American studies program is illegal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He concludes the letter by asking the board to &#8220;please accept my apologies for my role in the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his letter to the student group UNIDOS, he praises the students&rsquo; input as &#8220;valuable&#8221; and requests a meeting to establish &#8220;open dialogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the Tucson Independent Daily points out, Pedicone&rsquo;s sudden change-of-heart is curious, considering that just over two weeks ago he wrote an op-ed in the Arizona Star outraged over the protests and saying the students were being &#8220;exploited&#8221; and used as &#8220;pawns:&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>The <i>real</i> question is: <i>who</i> got to this spineless worm, and what did they use to convince him to crawl?  <i>That&rsquo;s</i> where the <i>real</i> story is.</p>
<p>Say, just for fun, imagine a school district being forced to make &#8220;European-American Studies&#8221; a compulsory course by a gang of violent, unstable fanatics.  Do you think the students would get a cringing apology as all their demands were granted?  Do you think they would escape all punishment?  Do you think the mainstream governmedia would remain silent about it?</p>

<p>After I read what is in that curriculum like, &#8220;killing all white males over 16,&#8221; when are we going to fight this open warfare on our people.</p>

<p>We have seen here on AR   &mdash;   time after time, year after year   &mdash;   a depressingly familiar pattern of (brief) white boldness followed by (prolonged) white apologizing, hand-wringing, breast-beating, and self-flagellation. </p>
<p>Sometimes it is from people who are probably afraid of losing their jobs (like this Schools Super in Tucson); and sometimes from people at the end of their careers or who otherwise appear to have nothing to lose (Dr James Watson, et al). Whether this cowardice is justified or not, the fact is that it happens with alarming regularity. There are far more prominent whites who get themselves into some sort of racial controversy (Don Imus, Michael Richards, and many many more) and who BACK DOWN or otherwise retreat, than there are who stand their ground in a &#8220;I cannot tell a lie, I did it&#8221;, George Washington sort of way. Almost nobody ever says, &#8220;Yeah I said that, and I believe it, and I can offer some pretty good proof for what I said, and if you want an apology from me, well, I can&rsquo;t apologize for the truth, so, frankly, you can whistle for it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Why not? Why does nobody (or almost nobody), suddenly caught in the spotlight saying the 21st Century version of &#8220;naughty words,&#8221; not just fling it back in the media&rsquo;s face? Does some shady somebody or some sinister government spooks &#8220;get to them&#8221; in the hours or days after their non-PC utterance, pay them a visit at home and make gruesome threats to their entire family? </p>
<p>Or is it just that they get intimidated by 100 messages on their answer machines and decide they&rsquo;ve had enough time as a &#8220;controversial&#8221; figure?</p>
<p>In any case, the thing to remember is this: those who grovel never seem to do themselves any good. Where&rsquo;s Imus these days? Seen any new Michael Richards TV shows or movies lately? Me neither. </p>
<p>So, re this TUSD business, I think this beta-male who&rsquo;s giving in to the local Guevaristas, is making not just a moral mistake, but also a tactical one. He thinks this captiulation to thuggery will be good for him, for his career. </p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>He thinks his &#8220;outreach&#8221; and his &#8220;willingness to compromise&#8221; and to &#8220;see both sides of the issue&#8221; will buy him credibility and bargaining power with the Reconquista rabble. </p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>The groveling approach DOES NOT WORK. </p>
<p><br/>
<i>&ldquo;We simply have to kind of bring that level of anxiety down to where we can begin to talk reasonably about this program, which we, which I think the district has said from the very beginning it supports,&rdquo; Pedicone told KOLD.</i></p>
<p><br/>
Those of us on the white side of the debate are not the ones raising the anxiety level, Mr. Pedicone. We&rsquo;re quite calm. We&rsquo;re not the ones shreiking and shoving and causing disturbances and requiring policing. The &#8220;anxiety&#8221; (read: rioting, etc) to which you euphemistically refer, has been coming ENTIRELY from our latino opposition. We&rsquo;re not the behavior problem; they are. </p>
<p>And yet, despite all their bad manners (to put it mildly), you choose to REWARD them with political success&hellip; the way a Skinner Box rewards its experimental lab rats by dispensing food pellets. You&rsquo;re giving them what they want   &mdash;   despite their having broken all the rules while seeking it. In Skinnerian terms, you are providing Positive Reinforcement to Negative Behavior. </p>
<p>&hellip;Which only means, NEXT time they want something, they&rsquo;ll know how to go about it: as loudly and as obnoxiously as possible. </p>

		<p>Sounds like whoever did the initial &#8220;exploitation&#8221; of the students has &#8220;persuaded&#8221; the Superintendent to change his mind.  I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt that pressure was applied to the Superintendent either through threat of job loss or by threats to his family.</p>

		<p>And here I thought Arizona had passed legislation to make any curriculum which specifically demonized other ethnies and detracted from social cohesion with American ideals not just &#8216;non-elective&rsquo; but _illegal_?</p>
<p>Have the courts finally &#8216;tabled&rsquo; that issue, along with 1070?</p>
<p>I hate to say this folks but we have lost the border.  If you are white and ablebodied, find a census chart like these-</p>

<p>And hie thee farthest from the big bad blue states!</p>
<p>We have a small chance, in middle America.  A very small chance.  But if we remain geographically isolated as we are now demographically divided, we will be butchered when the time comes to pull the plug on the USA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called &#8216;defeat in detail&rsquo; and we are being set up for a massive accept-or-annihilate campaign of &#8216;reeducation&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>How would elected officials who promote amnesty and open borders respond to the kind of hateful treason being taught so effectively to these hostile students?  </p>
<p>I think our representatives should be shown these articles and the news clip, and then be asked to comment.  I&rsquo;m sure their native white American constituents would be interested in their reactions.    </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this! Yet ANOTHER groveling idiot. I&rsquo;m so sick of this. He KNOWS this curriculum is wrong and he took a position on it. For Gods sake man, STAND your ground! I&rsquo;ve been criticized before for calling white people cowards for not standing up for themselves and our race, because we are not allowed to speak about such things. YES we are! We HAVE to! If this guy was not willing to ride this through to the end, he should have kept his mouth shut to begin with and not back- peddle, making us look weak and in the wrong. Like I have said before, if we don&rsquo;t find the courage to start speaking out, we are doomed.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no crime to be a poor student. If it should come to pass that the White kids who take the Mexican Studies class were to begin making low grades, even, perhaps, failing grades, the administration would be very hard pressed to finance the tutoring required to help these poor students pass the course.</p>
<p>If, Heaven forbid, almost all of the White kids who took the Mexican Studies class were to fail, TUSD would face a financial catastrophe if it were to stick by its decision to make the class mandatory. Most likely, the AZ Dept of Education would intervene and basically order TUSD to issue a waiver for promotion/graduation. </p>
<p>TUSD would certainly reconsider its decision to placate a minority when the economic consequences are so severe.</p>

		<p>Probably a lot of threats.  </p>
<p>Did he make more than 3 late mortgage payments?  Technically that is grounds for foreclosure in some states.  Did his kids get threatened that they would not get admitted to any college? Student loans?  Is he elected or appointed?  How long before his term is up? What about his wife&rsquo;s job?</p>
<p>The threats probably don&rsquo;t come from the thugs.  The thugs are just pawns of the Ford Foundation, Tides Foundation, one of George Soros&rsquo; foundations and the restaurant hotel food growing and processing warehouse retail construction government contracting and other importers of illegal Hispanic labor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet that Armour, Swift, Cudahy, Cargill, Tyson, Swanson&rsquo;s Jolly Green Giant, Sunkist, US Chamber of Commerce, US restaurant associations, McDonalds Burger King Denny&rsquo;s and the rest of the cheap labor advocates are behind this.</p>
<p>Every time the meatpackers bring in Somalians or somewhat civilized Hispanic Indians to a small White town an extremely well funded, well organized, sophisticated advocacy group appears out of nowhere.  Think the Somalis and Hispanic Indians who speak no English and only about 100 words of Spanish could create those organizations on their own?</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t.  It is the wealthiest people in the country who are doing it.</p>
<p>The death threats are probably real.  One thing I learned at the university level is that these demonstrations by anti White racist organizations are often planned in advance with the administration.  </p>
<p>At the university where I work, there was a big fuss about establishing a Chicano studies department.  The outside Hispanic organizations invaded fraternity houses, classrooms, libraries other buildings and the faculty club at lunchtime where they robbed every person who was in the building and did $100,000 worth of damage.</p>
<p>Campus police were told not to interfere, even with the faculty club invasion where the Hispanic thugs were not just trashing the premises but taking wallets and purses.</p>
<p>The whole thing was planned and approved of by the administration before the demonstrations.  The people pushing for the Chicano studies department by the way, were neither students nor staff.</p>
<p>Chicano is a slur.  Comes from the word chicanery.  Same word in Spanish and English.  Chicanery in English and Spanish means cheating, fraud, hustling, obtaining things under false pretense.</p>
<p>Chicano means cheater, liar, hustler, con man.  It&rsquo;s a word the White Mexicans use against the Indian Mexicans.</p>
<p>45 years ago, my Mother was at Cornell in New York when the blacks rampaged across campus in the same way with the prior approval and encouragement of the university administration.</p>
<p>Nothing new, been going on since 1960.</p>

		<p>I like to go to the horse&rsquo;s mouth when the horse can be found. (I know I&rsquo;m erring on the side of caution, but I&rsquo;m not going to even fully trust those excerpts on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s &#8220;Blaze&#8221;)</p>
<p>So check out the 7 items listed as &#8220;Our Goals&#8221; on the Tucson Unified School District&rsquo;s webpage for their Mexican American Studies program (In particular, note items 2, 5, 6, 7,&hellip;&#8221;pursuit of social justice,&#8221; &#8220;Authentic Caring,&#8221; &#8220;love,&#8221; etc.):</p>
<p>1. Advocating for and providing culturally relevant curriculum for grades K-12.<br/>
2. Advocating for and providing curriculum that is centered within the pursuit of social justice.<br/>
3. Advocating for and providing curriculum that is centered within the Mexican American/Chicano cultural and historical experience.<br/>
4. Working towards the invoking of a critical consciousness within each and every student.<br/>
5. Providing and promoting teacher education that is centered within Critical Pedagogy, Latino Critical Race Pedagogy, and Authentic Caring.<br/>
6. Promoting and advocating for social and educational transformation.<br/>
7. Promoting and advocating for the demonstration of respect, understanding, appreciation, inclusion, and love at every level of service.</p>
<p>I attended college 50 years ago when the goal was simply to acquire knowledge and understanding, and the academic standard that was at least professed and aimed for was objectivity. Apparently those former features of academia have been tossed into the clogged and overflowing national toilet.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot, we&rsquo;re talking about high school. Okay, that weakens my comment a little (in my day also, high school and elementary school were seen as places to instill what were regarded as the civic virtues of that time), but maybe not too much.</p>

		<p>I recently read Thomas Chittum&rsquo;s book, Civil War ll, and had pretty much dismissed it as delusional. Started looking into some of the things he had predicted fifteen years ago to see if he was right or not, he was. Compare his checklists from the book against current events and that census maps of migration patterns. </p>

		<p>This is very unfortunate, as the radical Brown racial expansionist forces are apparently advocating the extermination of all Whites in America and the overthrow of the U.S. Federal Government. Why should such indoctrination be forced? </p>
<p>I understand most Whites are self-hating. But do Whites really want to hand power to people who want to kill them and wipe out their government?</p>

		<p>How low can this man sink? Are there no right-thinking parents in the TUSD that can rise up and say, &#8220;No mas?&#8221; The stealth occupation of our country has resulted in this travesty, as we knew it would. What do the Represntatives of this district think? Do they agree with the policy of teaching Hispanic superiority? Is this okay with the non-Hispanic parents? The community? The text book committee? The teachers? Are text books being used in Mexico that teaches the students that Mexicans should be killed? I doubt it. This is preposterous&gt; I think that the TUSD needs lots of letters addressing this subject. This is NOT just a problem in Tucson&hellip;it affects us all.</p>

		<p>A authentic Mexican-American studies class would include study of the shortcomings of the Mexican history, government, economy, and society, just as authentic histories of the United States do the same for the United States. In addition, such a Mexican-American class would explain why many more Mexicans immigrate to the United States, even illegally, than the number of Americans immigrating to Mexico.<br/>
 <br/>
Too many national histories give students the belief that their country is better than all the others. Those of every country can learn from other countries, although not all countries are equal in admirable characteristics. </p>

		<p>The most worrying thing on the video was how the police just stood by and watched. If the La Raza crowd has disrupted one government meeting and rioted while the police stood by, it will probably only get worse next time. Also, if they love Mexico so much that they feel that Mexican-American studies should be mandatory, it might be an idea for them to celebrate their heritage back in Mexico. </p>

<p>I agree with #17 June. We need to send letters, emails, and/or make phone calls regarding this issue. The other side is using intimidation tactics to get their way. They don&rsquo;t care about the morals involved. Unfortunately, they are winning.</p>
<p>We White people need to start fighting back. I do NOT agree with violence or intimidation. However, we need to be more firm and demanding in our requests when fighting against the wrongheaded acquiescence of Superintendent Pedicone and the racist La Raza crowd.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start flooding Superintendent Pedicone&rsquo;s office with emails, letters, and phone calls. We will show the other side that we, too, will not back down.</p>

		<p>In my post #13, item 5 mentions  &#8220;Critical Pedagogy,&#8221; &#8221; Latino Critical Race Pedagogy,&#8221; and &#8220;Authentic Caring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researching &#8220;Authentic Caring,&#8221; I came across phrases like, &#8220;through a refinement of caring theory,&#8221; and &#8220;politically aware versus politically neutral <br/>
forms of authentic caring held respectively by the Latino community and the (Houston, Texas) school board members.&#8221; </p>
<p>To make a long story short, &#8220;Authentic Caring&#8221; as applied to teaching Mexican Americans is held by the linked author to involve, among other things, a recognition that Mexican culture is more personal than ours and that Mexican American students are alienated by educational settings in which teacher-student relations are less personal than in their own culture. </p>
<p>Having spent a little time in Mexico living with Mexican families, I think that&rsquo;s true, but what the author ignores of course is today&rsquo;s prevailing attitude that excuses the students from the necessity of overcoming their discomfort and achieving what success they are capable of in the new educational culture in which they find themselves. Instead, the blame is put on our culture for not adjusting itself to mimic theirs:</p>
<p>&#8220;students indeed withdrew from, or resisted schooling, often communicating the view that there was no real need to care about school if the school did not care for them&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;students are expected to embrace a Euro-centric curriculum that divests them of the very resources &mdash;  cultural and linguistic &mdash; that are necessary for them to achieve highly in school&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;children are asked to care about a curriculum that is culturally invasive and holds their community in contempt&#8221;</p>

		<p>Regarding &#8220;Critical Pedagogy,&#8221; and &#8221; Latino Critical Race Pedagogy,&#8221; this from Wiki:</p>
<p>Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago has &ldquo;label[ed] critical race theorists and postmodernists the &lsquo;lunatic core&rsquo; of &lsquo;radical legal egalitarianism.&rsquo;&rdquo;[9] He writes,</p>
<p>&#8216;What is most arresting about critical race theory is that&hellip;it turns its back on the Western tradition of rational inquiry, forswearing analysis for narrative. Rather than marshal logical arguments and empirical data, critical race theorists tell stories  &mdash;  fictional, science-fictional, quasi-fictional, autobiographical, anecdotal  &mdash;  designed to expose the pervasive and debilitating racism of America today. By repudiating reasoned argumentation, the storytellers reinforce stereotypes about the intellectual capacities of nonwhites.[10]&rsquo;</p>
<p>Judge Alex Kozinski, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, writes that Critical Race Theorists have constructed a philosophy which makes a valid exchange of ideas between the various disciplines unattainable.</p>
<p>&#8216;The radical multiculturalists&rsquo; views raise insuperable barriers to mutual understanding. Consider the Space Traders story. How does one have a meaningful dialogue with Derrick Bell? Because his thesis is utterly untestable, one quickly reaches a dead end after either accepting or rejecting his assertion that white Americans would cheerfully sell all blacks to the aliens. The story is also a poke in the eye of American Jews, particularly those who risked life and limb by actively participating in the civil rights protests of the 1960&rsquo;s. Bell clearly implies that this was done out of tawdry self-interest. Perhaps most galling is Bell&rsquo;s insensitivity in making the symbol of Jewish hypocrisy the little girl who perished in the Holocaust  &mdash;  as close to a saint as Jews have. A Jewish professor who invoked the name of Rosa Parks so derisively would be bitterly condemned  &mdash;  and rightly so.[11]&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Under another article, several commenters pointed out that whites tend to be spineless in matters such as this more from fear of lawsuits and ruined careers than from desire to seem enlightened. When you have something you have something to lose, and though Latino immigrants don&rsquo;t respect our laws they also don&rsquo;t hesitate a nanosecond to file lawsuits and complain loudly about &#8220;unfairness&#8221; any time an authority figure does his/her job&hellip; especially if the authority figure is white.</p>
<p>When this story first came out, one of the first commenters suggested that white students simply behave during the mandatory course in white genocide a la raza by acting just like Latino students: Be disruptive, tear up handouts, call the teacher a racist, and such. I&rsquo;m afraid, though, that young, smart, college-bound whites will turn out to be as spineless as the average white adult, and for the same reasons.</p>

And so on and on and on&hellip; </p>
<p>Thank you, H. Dumpty, for that explication of what is apparently the latest nonsensical buzzword of grievance-group academe (latin-american division). I noticed that phrase &#8220;Authentic Caring&#8221; when I first read the article, and didn&rsquo;t recognize it   &mdash;   though I suspected what it meant was exactly the sort of touchy-feely Razista anti-gringo jargon that Mr. Dumpty has revealed it as. An unkind and unforgivably eurocentric interpretation of Authentic Caring might be, &#8220;Because mestizos can&rsquo;t compete with caucasians academically, they instead insist that EMOTIONAL qualities be elevated to equal status of intellectual qualities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The underlying idea being, of course, that although us blancos might have some cultural achievements to be proud of, we are crippled by our excessivley rational thinking, our emotional and sexual repression, our fixation on money and the bottom line, etc. Whereas the caring, sharing, natural-born-socialists of Centro America are, by contrast, living, loving superior beings who are here to teach the gringos some lessons about Life. You know: like the heroes in Avatar, only brown not blue. </p>
<p>I truly believe this is the sort of &#8220;thinking&#8221; that drives such pseudo-pedagogies as &#8220;Authentic Caring.&#8221; The &#8220;progressives&#8221; would have you believe that, in learning, the input of the heart is every bit as important as the input of the mind. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s just not true. Anybody can feel. Not everybody can think. That&rsquo;s why we have tests that measure Intelligence Quotient, not Emotional Quotient. Colleges are interested in your IQ not your EQ because, well, because from a scholastic point-of-view, a student&rsquo;s EQ is MEANINGLESS. I&rsquo;m sure the bushmen of the Kalahari would score well on an EQ test. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they have anything to contribute to the world. &#8220;Authentic Caring&#8221; seems to suggest that if us anglos quit being such a bunch of meanies always talking about test scores and GPAs and stuff, and if we all hold hands and study together in an &#8220;emotional&#8221; way, all those millions upon millions of low-performing Mayan students in American classrooms will start to do as well as the European and Asian students. </p>
<p>BTW, has anyone else here on AR come across the term &#8220;Authentic Caring&#8221; before? Because it&rsquo;s a new one on me. But then, I don&rsquo;t live in Tucson. </p>

<p>Authentic Caring and Critical Race Theory (among other bogus, specious, <i>stupid</i> hogwash) make up a large part of the curriculum of American ed schools   &mdash;   government education, that is, these days composed entirely of &#8220;theory&#8221; rather than substance; its Prime Directive to brainwash American children into becoming unquestioning Drones of the State.</p>
<p>I have been forced to listen to and have had this garbage shoved down my throat for years in teachers&rsquo; professional developments, most of it gobbledegook focused on making sure non-Whites feelings are not hurt.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ve maintained here that American education is not about educating children. Hardly!  </p>

<p>No, I never did either. At first reading, I passed right over them   &mdash;   though I thought  they sounded rather strange. Now, I see that those terms that are capitalized have been given their own speial meaning, as Mr. Dumpty has researched and explained to us.</p>

It&rsquo;s all our fault that they fail, because we&rsquo;re not &#8220;Authentically Caring&#8221; enough to value their emotional attachments over mere, silly scientific facts and logic. What hard-headed, hard-hearted monsters we are!  </p>
<p>I tell you, if they, through force of sheer numbers alone, get control of society, it will mean the end of civilization and progress, the end of science, and a regression  to primitivism. Emotion and superstition will again rule.  Just the way they like it.</p>
<p>BTW, I do find it enormously humorous (if that&rsquo;s the suitable word) that a people who practiced, only a few centuries ago, ripping out and eating the hearts of living victims, should dare to be talking about authentic caring!   Some joke!!!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a joke alright.  But not a funny one.  And they will be just as &#8220;authentically caring&#8221; and sensitive to YOUR  needs and feelings, if and when they hold the upper hand over YOU, Heaven forbid that ever happens!</p>

<p>Mexicans, Africans, and most third worlders have a great deal of difficulty distinguishing between feelings and facts. And also between reality and wishful thinking. Or between truth and superstition.  They think that if you believe something hard enough, or say it often enough, it will become true.</p>
<p>How do you deal with this unscientific, primitive mentality?  Formerly, we arbitrarily imposed our rules and our science and maintained that OUR way was the right way. Period!</p>
<p>But now they are going on the attack and putting the shoe on the other foot. They accuse us  (and our entire culture) of being cold, hard, and unfeeling and not &#8220;Authentically Caring&#8221; enough.  Blah, blah!  So now, it is we who are the culprits who must apologize and get in line with THEIR standards&hellip; not they who must conform to ours.  We must learn to recognize FEELINGS as equally valid to FACTS.</p>
<p>I say again that these mestizos have not come up with this cunning  philosophical strategy on their own. They are mere dumb pawns in the game, who are being manipulated by much more cunning players than they are. They are just useful fools who don&rsquo;t know what they are doing (bringing down whitey). Once their usefulness in that regard is served, they may in turn be replaced by someone else.  </p>
<p>They think they are going to take over and will be in charge. Nonsense!  They will NEVER be in charge.<br/>

		<p>What this should tell people is that Mestizos are preaching about taking a class that their own gang banging kids probably won&rsquo;t even pass. It&rsquo;s like the 3 years of Spanish I took in high school. I may know all of the slang &amp; bad words, but nothing to use in the business world. I don&rsquo;t sell drugs, am not a liberal lawyer in some desert Southwest wasteland, and don&rsquo;t plan on traveling to South America. I guess I&rsquo;ll be all right without it. </p>
<p>And Bon- the White kids may not get a tutor, but they will get a truly valuable lesson. Learn the Latino history &amp; use it against the libs one day. Outliberalize the liberals. Literally &amp; liberally.</p>

		<p>My neighbors must wonder what I&rsquo;m hooting about every 5 minutes. It&rsquo;s things like the two excerpts below, as I read a preview on google books of  &#8220;Critical race theory: an introduction,&#8221; by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic:</p>
<p>p 17:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;prejudice sprang up with slavery. Before then, educated Europeans held a generally positive attitude toward Africans, recognizing that African civilization was highly advanced with vast libraries and centers of learning. Africans pioneered mathematics, medicine, and astronomy long before Europeans had much knowledge of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>p. 25:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has heard the story about eskimos who have twenty-six words for different kinds of snow. Imagine the opposite predicament  &mdash;  a society that has only one word (say, racism) for a phenomenon that is much more complex than that. For example: intentional racism; unintentional racism; unconscious racism; institutional racism; racism tinged with homophobia or sexism; racism that takes the form of indifference or coldness; and white privilege  &mdash;  reserving favors, smiles, kindness, the best stories, one&rsquo;s most charming side, and invitations to real intimacy for one&rsquo;s own kind or class.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/lRw3R" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/lRw3R</a></p>
<p>The authors omitted &#8220;brain chemical racism,&#8221; as reported in this NYTimes article:</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean that a chemical basis for ethnocentrism is embedded in the human brain?&hellip;Dr. De Dreu said. &#8216;Ethnocentrism is a very basic part of humans, and it&rsquo;s not something we can change by education.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/MRECv" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/MRECv</a></p>
<p>Universities should scrap their remaining Euro-centric departments and set up separate departments for each kind of racism, omitting &#8220;brain chemical racism&#8221; of course.</p>

		<p>You learn something new every day.  I&rsquo;d never heard of this &#8220;authentic caring&#8221; stuff before today.  I thank you.  I found a description of the differences in white and Mestizo &#8220;caring&#8221; here:</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/WQRQ8</p>
<p>Her central observation is that there were two very different, culturally influenced concepts of &ldquo;caring&rdquo; at Seguín High:</p>
<p>1) The predominately non-Latino teachers and administrators wanted students to &ldquo;care about&rdquo; their education. This is an object-based, aesthetic concept of caring.</p>
<p>2) The predominantly Mexican and Mexican-American student body wanted to be &ldquo;cared for&rdquo; by their teachers. Students had a more holistic and personal concept of education, borrowed from Mexican culture. This form of caring/educating (or educación) is described by Valenzuela as authentic and relationship- rather than object-oriented.</p>
<p>Oh, I care about learning something in school, I must have ice water in my veins!  Ay!</p>
<p>They want to be cared for?  Call your mother, or one of your zillion relatives.</p>
<p>So Mestizos are authentically caring, and whites are not caring.  And they&rsquo;re right.  Because I do not care about this stuff.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that the white &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; traitors WANT an ignorant, incurious, superstitious, easily led population.  And the Mestizos are more than happy to wallow in primitivism.</p>
<p>Thank God I&rsquo;m homeschooling.  They will not waste my childrens&rsquo; time with this nonsense.</p>

<p> &#8220;Oh, and let me add this. These kids are not coming up with these elaborate excuses on their own. All this talk about &ldquo;Critical Race Theory&rdquo; etc. is far beyond them! Nor is this high-flutin&rsquo; intellectualizing coming from the mestizo community itself. Most of them wouldn&rsquo;t have the vaguest idea what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>IT IS BEING PREPARED AND FED TO THEM! Fed to them by white-hating Marxist ideologues among us who wish to bring down white America. Once again, the real enemy is within our ranks, passing among us as our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure te curriculm was cooked up in some feminazi /hispanic/marxist studies department at some 3rd rate community college and funded by Soros, Foxman, Tides or  Ford Foundations.</p>
<p>These students are like the proletarian rent a mobs organized by Lenin and Trotsky and the rest of their tribe and funded by the German government back in Russia in 1917.</p>
