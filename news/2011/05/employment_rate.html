<h1>Employment Rate for Black Men at Record Low</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zachary Roth, Yahoo! News, May 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Indeed, the percentage of African-American men with a job has dropped to its lowest level since records began in 1972, according to the government&rsquo;s monthly jobs report released last week.</p>
<p>Even as the economy added a better-than-expected 244,000 jobs, the percentage of black males over 20 who are currently employed dropped slightly to 56.9, the Labor Department&rsquo;s April report shows. For whites, the equivalent figure is 68.1 percent.</p>
<p>Before this recession, the percentage of black adult men with a job had never dropped below 60 percent, according to Labor Department statistics.</p>
<p>And among blacks, it&rsquo;s not just men who are suffering. Just 51.5 percent of African-Americans across the board  &mdash;  compared to 59.5 percent of whites  &mdash;  have a job, the numbers show. That&rsquo;s the lowest level for blacks since 1984. (That group includes 16- to 19-year-olds, who are employed at a far lower rate than their elders.)</p>
<p>These employment rates are calculated differently from the top-line unemployment rate, which includes only those actively looking for work, and inched back up last month to 9 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And employers&rsquo; hiring practices may be making the problem worse. As we&rsquo;ve reported, online job listings telling the unemployed not to apply have proliferated in recent years. The federal government is currently probing whether such listings illegally discriminate against African Americans, who are disproportionately likely to be among the jobless.</p>

Combined that news with this news about adult black men, (and the tangential news about black women), and it&rsquo;s insane that the &#8220;official&#8221; unemployment rate is only 9%.  You would have to have virtually full employment among white women for the real unemployment rate to be within even spitting distance of 9%.</p>

		<p>Never mind blacks for the moment! I didn&rsquo;t know there were ads telling unemployed not to apply for jobs. It&rsquo;s no wonder the job market is so poor. That and the bigger issue lack of US manufacturing being bought and sold by it&rsquo;s own patronage. Blacks don&rsquo;t tend to create their own employment like other groups do. </p>

<p>Yes, and their Obama, is getting ready to push for amnesty for illegal aliens, which will just about put the coup de grace on black male employment for all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>Blacks are responsible for promoting their own dispossession, but they&rsquo;re too dumb to understand it.</p>
<p>All they know is that they want to water down white population figures and nothing else matters.  Hang on.  It&rsquo;s about to hit the fan in a few months.  I look for black rioting due to austerity measures and no jobs.</p>

South Africa has an unemployment rate of somewhere between 45% &amp; 60% depending on whether you believe government figures or reality.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m probably not the only one who will suggest this, but I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that the &#8220;white&#8221; numbers include hispanics and illegal aliens on welfare. I don&rsquo;t believe for one minute that white Americans only have a 68.1% employment rate. How terrible would it read if whites had a 93% employment rate while blacks have a dismal 56.9% employment rate. In addition the 56.9 of employed blacks are mostly employed in low skill, low wage jobs in which little or no tax revenue is collected. The 43.1% of blacks who are unemployed are on welfare and other public assistance programs paid for by white American workers, borrowed money from overseas, and printed money. </p>

		<p>It will become increasingly clear in America who are powerful and who are not. It will also become increasingly clear to whites that many jobs that their youth deserves is often going to much less qualified blacks due to blatant, non-meritocratic racism called &#8216;Affirmative Action&rsquo;</p>
<p>This will only cause more and more issues as jobless people are more likely to get into crime and become destructive to society, no matter what gender or race. But this pattern holds much more strongly for both men and blacks so as the economy keeps doing worse and worse, the strain of hordes of black men onto the U.S. economic and social fabric will get worse and worse.</p>
<p>This time, however, we don&rsquo;t live in the 1970s. The republican party is essentially the white party plus some extras, and even if the leadership is out of touch, you have much more white (implicit) activism(e.g. Tea Party), as whites realise deep down that they are the only ones who care about America in the truest sense and don&rsquo;t look to exploit it for their own ends, whether by welfare or ethnic projects.</p>
<p>Since race is to modern America what sex was to Victorian England, I doubt that the issue will be raised seriously but it will tug at people&rsquo;s lives increasingly in the next few short years under the surface. I think we are living in interesting times. I also think we will be seeing an increasing movement to segregation, as more and more whites move to the Great White North. </p>

		<p>3:  I think the main reason a lot of job openings won&rsquo;t accept applications from currently unemployed people is because the given employers and firms know that a good chunk of those currently unemployed just lost really well paying jobs, and that the job which they are offering isn&rsquo;t quite as good.  Even among people desperate for work, they won&rsquo;t be that good of an employee if their last job paid them twice as much.  In contrast, employers tend to like potential employees that are currently working, because (A) the person&rsquo;s resume is fresh, and (B) odds are, if the person is already working, it&rsquo;s at a job that pays less well than the one being offered.</p>

		<p><i>Hang on. It&rsquo;s about to hit the fan in a few months.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to hit the fan until somebody, a President with a secret unknown to the general public, seriously conservartive ideology, and Senators and Representatives who feel the same gain power. Until then it will just be increased agression by &#8220;people of color&#8221; towards white people and increasing attacks on white people.</p>
<p>In Chicago, within weeks of Obama being elected, black on white crime shot up significantly in high traffic areas where white people would be but near streets that would get the perpetrators straight back to the ghetto.</p>
<p>It is going to get worse for a few years. Employment has nothing to do with it. Most of them are unemployable &hellip;.. it&rsquo;s not a secret. And (unfortunately) it is going to take the dismantling of (out-of-control) labor unions to do it.</p>
<p>For those of you that see my ()&rsquo;s and wonder why, I am from West Virginia and some day I will be buried there, and I know the good that unions did in the past but times have changed and so have the unions demands. They are all about money for union management and financing lobbying. The SEIU is the worst. Do a search on &#8220;SEIU benefits&#8221; and at the benefits they offer their members &hellip;. the described benefits are nore like benefits that I get from carrying a certain credit card than REAL benefits. But those members feel it&rsquo;s okay to pay the grift &hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll shut up now.</p>

		<p>Their rate for business-ownership is at a record low too I&rsquo;m sure. If they owned their owned businesses, then they could employ other blacks in their own neighborhoods. They wouldn&rsquo;t need to seek employment so much outside of their own sphere if that was the case.</p>

<p>In similar, similar news, the recession has been called a &#8220;Mancession&#8221; because it was the jobs men most commonly occupy, the sales jobs, truck driving, construction, etc., that were most affected.  Via 40 years of AA, women occupy the lion&rsquo;s share of State, Local, and Federal jobs. Oh, did I include County?  In many households, the women have become the breadwinners (if they haven&rsquo;t dumped their unemployed spouses) with the most stable and reliable jobs.  I can&rsquo;t believe how many men I saw pushing baby strollers during the day last year.  </p>
<p>Yes, my wife works, but I cannot get a job cleaning a toilet, especially with a master&rsquo;s degree in science, because I am a blue-eyed white man and older.  She sees what I see and understands it the same.</p>
<p>The new budget trimming is finally beginning to affect these positions, as the men are just beginning to see a little improvement.  But with the entrenched corruption that has set in over decades, such as the tax payer fed unions in Wisconsin that bargain with tax payer&rsquo;s money, it will be difficult to make any improvements and another lay off of men in &#8220;men&rsquo;s&#8221; jobs (unless women decide they want them) will begin again.</p>

<p>Indeed it is! (insane, that is)  A lot of financial analysts and business/investment advisors do not depend on government-produced stats when it comes to fiscal matters    &mdash;    they know full well  government data are not reliable; &#8220;readjusted&#8221; or &#8220;cooked&#8221; to give the public a rosy picture of the state of the economy, strength of the dollar, false employment figures, etc.  &mdash;   leading to mal-investment or worse.</p>
<p>Many depend on John William&rsquo;s <i>Shadow Government Statistics</i> for more reliable information:</p>
<p>John writes:</p>
<p><i>Have you ever wondered why the CPI, GDP and employment numbers run counter to your personal and business experiences? The problem lies in biased and often-manipulated government reporting.</i></p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see:<br>
-  Black male unemployment at 43%<br>
-  Detroit (90%+ black) has a 49% illiteracy rate.<br>
-  Black illegitimacy rate is around 75%<br>
-  Black crime rate.<br>
-  Black academic achievement gap when compared to whites<br>
-  Black welfare/government assistance rate</p>
<p>You would think that even the politically correct pathogens could connect the dots after awhile.</p>
<p>Regarding the black unemployment rate, the problem is not the lack of jobs - otherwise, we wouldn&rsquo;t have an illegal alien problem.  The issue is that blacks will not work.  Ask any landscaping contractor, roofer, concrete contractor, etc, etc, why they have a crew of Mexicans, and he will tell you that they will work.</p>
<p>Unlike most blacks and sadly, many low skilled whites.</p>

Equally strange that they both have large black populations. There are no comparative figures for black African countries which have no welfare benefits and they seem to prosper quite well, even to the extent that we are still called upon to feed their starving kids. In fact, despite that Africa is a huge fertile continent, blessed with mainly clement weather patterns and rainfall, how come these intelligent black Africans don&rsquo;t grow their own food and have enough left over for export? Well, the White farmers did just that, until they were slaughtered or dispossessed by corrupt black politicians. It is said that these farmers grew huge quantities of Mango and exported all of them to UK supermarkets. Well, it is probably a lot easier to do that by air than try to sell them on the local market and be accused of driving local black farmers out of business. Anyway, the ramshackle condition of the road and rail network originally built by Whites and totally maintenance-free in the 50 or 60 years since independence makes transport of soft fruit impossible.</p>

		<p>What doesn&rsquo;t appear to be mentioned is that there are many black men (and many black women, and many brown, red, yellow, white, green, and purple men and women), who are unemployed of their own choice.</p>
<p>For many black men, working a legitimate job is chump change when they can be selling drugs - a &#8220;trade&#8221; in which they can earn enormous sums of tax-free cash. </p>
<p>For men and women of all colors, welfare (by which I mean not only TANF, but also SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, and on and on) can &#8220;pay&#8221; as much as $70K a year in some places. </p>

		<p>Thomas Mauthus the famed economist would love this data. He would say see I told you so. The truth is to have a continuing employable population you need a trainable intellect and disposition towards life and progress. </p>
<p>Economic progress meant less woodsmen to cut timber but more people in manufacturing and transportation this is why Mauthus was wrong he didn&rsquo;t account for progress growing the economy. This is also why Marx was wrong. Assuming a stupid minority/majority economice growth is impossible.</p>

<p>Members of the black CBC, those who claim to represent &#8220;black interests&#8221; are also busy campaigning for amnesty and open borders, including al sharpton and jesse jackson:</p>
<p><i>Al Sharpton vowed to bring &#8220;freedom walkers&#8221; to Arizona to engage in non-violent civil disobedience if the state&rsquo;s strict new immigration law goes into effect.</i></p>
<p>And from  Jackson:</p>
<p><i>Immigrants are not criminals and should not be criminalized&hellip;Comprehensive immigration reform is needed now more than ever before. The federal government must quickly move to enact legislation.</i></p>
<p>And, the hypocritical (or stupid) CBC which demands &#8220;action&#8221; from 0bama on high black unemployment, but:</p>
<p><i>The 43 members of the CBC, like 0bama, consistently opposes tough enforcement of laws against employing illegal aliens.</i></p>
<p><i>The CBC marches in lockstep with the interests that promote illegal immigration. Since taking office last year, Mr. Obama has all but halted immigration enforcement in the workplace - a policy that enjoys the support of the CBC.</i></p>
<p><i>The CBC also has been front and center in the effort to enact amnesty for millions of illegal aliens and throw open the doors to still higher levels of future immigration.</i></p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange that all the jobs the illegal immigrants are taking from the blacks and not a peep of complaint by the black politicians? </p>
<p>I think they are content to be on welfare and the politicians can keep it that way. I think the civil rights movement ended a few decades ago and now it is just a way to keep welfare alive.</p>

		<p>Whites need to make it clear to blacks that as long as they continue to support open borders there will be no government benefits.  They can have one or the other but they cannot have both.  In fact they might get neither.  </p>

		<p> Im actually surprised that black employment is so close to that of whites. I believe that I am like most on this board. I was not born with a bias toward blacks. My parents didnt instill bias when I was young. I have learned to distrust and avoid blacks in my 40+ years on this earth. Among my experiences with blacks have been on the job. I can count on one hand blacks that were good employees. Lazy, shiftless, sneaky, incompetant, dumb, etc&hellip; spending more energy trying to get out of work than actually working. That opinion is from a lifetime of experience. It isnt a whim or a &#8220;feeling&#8221;. It is what I have known. I now own my own business and I will not consider hiring a black man&hellip;ever.</p>

		<p>From Lee:  &#8220;Ask any landscaping contractor, roofer, concrete contractor, etc, etc, why they have a crew of Mexicans, and he will tell you that they will work.Unlike most blacks and sadly, many low skilled whites&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m sorry sir but I must take umbrage with those last few words..I just recently visited my daughter in Lancaster, PA. We were sitting in the breakfast nook of her house chatting &amp; drinking coffee &amp; the garbage truck pulled up in front, low &amp; behold, the garbage men were white!..Later, Her neighbors had lawn service people come in, guess what?, they too were white. The next day her neighbor across the street was having their shingles replaced on their roof, the ENTIRE crew was white!.</p>
<p>You see whites WILL do this work (& do it VERY well), but alas many companies REFUSE to pay a living wage. See, WE have a stake in the future of this country, we have roots, foundations, &amp; we have NO WHERE ELSE to go!!..If an illegal gets fired, he goes back to Mexico (or wherever!) &amp; may come back another day, he has no stake in this country&hellip;Also he does not receive insurance or a 401K, another incentive for contractors to pay them &#8220;under the table&#8221;.</p>
<p>I myself had worked for many years as an aircraft fuel systems technician for the commercial airlines..It&rsquo;s hard, dirty, nasty work. It also requires a goodly amount of intelligence because there is a great deal of trouble shooting needed (ergo-deductive reasoning skills)..In ALL the years I worked there it was ALL white!! (we had 1 native American!, no blacks EVER!).</p>
<p>Our people WILL do this work. I&rsquo;ve done it!.. I&rsquo;ve seen it!.. We do though, have to be able to support ourselves &amp; our families.</p>

		<p>Not many blacks are capable of being research chemists or aeronautic engineers, but I&rsquo;ve rarely seen an illegal immigrant do a job a black person (or for that matter, a teenager) couldn&rsquo;t do.  So black people, thank Obama and his advocacy of illegal immigration for your high unemployment rate.  But also blame your lack of a work ethic   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s a reason employers prefer the illegal aliens.<br>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t this number be adjusted by the number of black men who are unemployable due to wretched work ethics, bad attitudes, and hopelessly criminal behavior?  I&rsquo;d wager that would take 40% of black men out of the pool altogether. </p>

		<p>In the big scheme of things, there really was little difference between the policies of Barack Obama and John McCain.  Had McCain been elected in 2008, the economy would now probably be in the same stagnant state.  The difference would be that blacks would be howling about institutional racism and Jim Crow.  With their man Barack in the White House, all is right in the world.   </p>

		<p>Even the educated, relatively employable blacks aren&rsquo;t a good deal for employers.  We interviewed an African electrical engineer back in the mid-1990s, and most of the interview consisted of him griping about how blacks are treated in the USA.  We realized that this grievance-monger was a lawsuit waiting to happen and didn&rsquo;t hire him.</p>
