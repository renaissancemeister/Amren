			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS (Miami), May 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Miami-Dade mayoral candidate along with students are expected to protest a campaign forum Wednesday to express their outrage and disapproval of FIU hosting a Spanish-only event.</p>
<p>The debate, held at FIU&rsquo;s Wertheim Theatre, broadcast by Univision radio and set for rebroadcast by Univision channel 23 television, was open only to candidates Julio Robaina, Marcelo Llorente, Carlos Gimenez and Jose &#8220;Pepe&#8221; Cancio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was appalled,&#8221; said Luther Campbell, a former rap star and African American candidate for mayor. &#8220;The university is having a Cuban-only forum, which is wrong to the students, because the students are from all different races and all different cultures and all the students don&rsquo;t speak only Spanish.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its release announcing the forum, Univision said the &#8220;participants were selected based on the amount of funds raised&#8221; by their campaigns. The four top fund-raisers are the only Hispanics in the race. Cancio  &mdash;  in fourth place in fund raising  &mdash;  is a distant fourth.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for FIU said the school was only providing a location for the debate, and was otherwise not involved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roosevelt Bradley, another African American candidate told CBS4 News he was &#8220;outraged&#8221; that FIU&rsquo;s president would allow such a &#8220;polarizing and divisive event&#8221; to be held on the campus of a public, state-run university. Bradley said &#8220;this turns the clock back 50 years&#8221; on race and ethnic relations in the community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We have a large Hispanic community, but this is Miami and we like to celebrate our diversity here,&#8221; said student Esra Erdogan. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to exclude any candidate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other candidates vying for the spot as Miami-Dade mayor include Eddie Lewis, Farid Khavari, Jeffrey Lampert and Gabrielle Redfern.<br>

		<p>Luther Campbell, if anyone remembers, is from the infamous <i>2 Live Crew</i> rap group that created a national controversy in the late 80s/early 90s with their obscene music. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s funnier. The fact that these Black candidates are getting to taste the ethnic solidarity that is constantly shoved in the faces of Whites or the fact that a clown like Luther Campbell actually thinks he&rsquo;s a legitimate candidate for mayor of one of the biggest cities in America.</p>

The black community has been siding with Hispanics for years for two reasons: the mythical non-white coalition that they hope to develop to take down the white man and to tick off conservative white people who oppose their own dispossession.  </p>
<p>Now the black man has come face to face with the fact that he too is being marginalized and made irrelevant by Hispanics. </p>
<p>What I have noticed about this story is how little attention it has gotten in the black media. I suspect that this story is being kept out of the black press because those in control of pushing such stories don&rsquo;t want blacks to see what&rsquo;s going on. I suspect they want to keep the myth of the non-white coalition going.</p>
<p>Mr. Luther &#8220;Pop That Coochie&#8221; Campbell is on his own. In this instance, the &#8216;leaders&rsquo; of the black community would rather side with Hispanics to take down the white man than to call attention to the social and political threat Hispanics pose to blacks.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t follow rap or hip hop very closely, so correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but isn&rsquo;t this the same Luther Campbell who&rsquo;s the author of that immortal literary work, &#8216;I&rsquo;ve Got S*** on My Mind&rsquo;? If so, I believe he would be the ideal Mayor of Miami. </p>
<p>     However, it&rsquo;s not in the cards; not in the demographic cards. American blacks invented the absurd concept &#8220;people of colour&#8221; and alleged a socio-economic-cultural solidarity among the non-Whites against &#8220;the man&#8221; in their struggle for racial justice  &mdash;  -but it just ain&rsquo;t so. The Hispanics have used this victimhood identification to cash in at the bank of racial justice to get all kinds of wonderful freebies (liar loans, food stamps, pell grants, affirmative action, etc). They are advancing, some of them into the middle classes while the blacks, who refused to see the Hispanics were in direct economic competition with them, are sidelined and sinking deeper into dysfunction.     </p>

		<p>The blacks better realize that Hispanics will not bow down to them like the whites do. As a group Hispanics of all ethnicities tend to be chauvanistic and racist and, in general, get away with it.</p>
<p>If Hispanics ever do take over our country, the blacks better realize that they will go back to second class citizenship. </p>
<p>Think about this. What kind of racial historical grievance can the blacks use against the Hispanics to get their way?</p>

<p>Exactly. And white Hispanics like myself even less so. Consider: people from the Latin American republics already come from multiracial societies - various combinations of White, Black and Native American are present in most of these places and predominate in some. We <i> know <i> what its like - unlike those North American whites, naive beyond belief, who come from largely White areas and get most of their information about Blacks from the ridiculous mainstream media. </i></i></p>

		<p>In Mexico, the Color Continuum runs basically North To South with the fairest skinned Elites in the capital.  And a sea of varying pallor Mestizos pushing down the very dark skinned indians of the deep south, with small differentials around the resorts.</p>
<p>Thing is, the Mexicans know how the game is rigged in their country _and have learned from it_.  There will be no mestizo revolution against the 10% of their own homeland who LOOK WHITE.  Because that ten percent include two of the world&rsquo;s richest men and they will basically use the Mexican military and their billions of dollars to butcher anyone who tries to usurp their monopoly controls.</p>
<p>Instead, the mestizos will do the same thing here they know works in Mexico: inundate and isolate, taking white women along the way, and hoping to get &#8216;white enough&rsquo; to have their own little casta system.</p>
<p>When they achieve this, Blacks will be the equivalent of the Mexican Indians.</p>
<p>Not that I care.  Miami-Dade is as all of Florida now is: a complete write off.  The only people who would -want- to rule such a pestilential city as State are those who are so corrupt that only the thought of power and money, &#8216;from any source&rsquo; (stripper tax), can distract them from the obvious shrieking agony of a destroyed society with zero social cohesion and massive poverty.</p>
<p>If you want me to believe in the ability to save America, show me a mayoral or gubernatorial campaign in Kansas or Iowa.  Because Middle America is literally the last place left we have a chance to be ourselves.</p>

		<p>A Cogent Black Response To The Spanish Only Miami Mayoral Debate <br>
Presented At A Florida State University</p>
<p>SOJOURNER WELLS WRITES:</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of why it is absolutely ludicrous for African Americans to make any coalitions with any group of &#8220;hispanics.&#8221;  These invaders did not build this country, and have no vested interest in honoring, maintaining, respecting or promoting our history, culture nor heritage.  They come here to sop up the gravy, to use their contrived collective phony identity to seize political power with the intent to transfer American wealth to their La Raza and their native nations. </p>
<p>They are hostile to indigenous Americans, be they black or white. They have no history here, which makes them permanent disgruntled outsiders. They are basically peasant stock that have somehow convinced themselves that they should immediately be part of American leadership while they illegally invade our nation, despite the fact that they refuse to speak English like the rest of the people who have immigrated to this great nation.</p>
<p>Black Americans wake up! Stop allowing paid Judas goat politicians like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and Tavis Smiley, and the treasonous Democrat Party to promote outrageous &#8220;black/brown&#8221; political merging. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS KILLING BLACK AMERICA! So-called &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are attempting to build a parasitic relationship with Black America. They intend to consume Black America&rsquo;s aspirations, advancement, and legitimacy in their unattainable goal to become a dominant force in American politics. Black Americans have a history to protect and <br>
promote. This nation was built upon the backs of Black labor. The story of this nation cannot be told without recognition of the issues of and contributions of Black Americans all the way back to before the Revolutionary War. African Americans contributions to the US as inventors, as tireless workers,  to music, dance, entertainment and sports are critical to the foundation of this nation as a political entity and to the development of our cultural profile. So-called &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; have no such legacy. Their relationship to African Americans is wrought with eternal jealousy and clandestine manipulative machinations.</p>
<p>African Americans should not be deceived by revenge political strategies. Black Americans have more in common with the Anglo/Saxon white Protestant than they do with these irrational Spanish-speaking newcomers. African Americans have the white Protestant&rsquo;s name, blood and DNA. We share a common history in founding this nation, and practice a common Christian culture.  Again, Black Americans wake up and join other American patriots in defending our nation from these usurpers and the treasonous politicians that support them!</p>

		<p>I grew up in Miami during the 1950&rsquo;s and early 1960&rsquo;s.  Back then most of Miami was white and generally Southern in deportment.  Many for some reason hailed from the Carolinas.  The blacks were fairly quiet and lived in a small area just north of downtown. It was a tropical paradise.  Everything changed when the cubans came in the early &rsquo;60s.  White people just up and left in the hundreds, then thousands, then hundreds of thousands, mostly after the 1965 immigration changes.  All sorts of Central Americans and South Americans, lots of bad people, criminals all for being illegal.  Most of these new arrivals were the cast-offs of their home country, dark, squat, and poor.  Most whites moved to the county north of Miami, Broward and for a time just shook their heads at the trashing of Miami and the Banana Republic it became.  Eventually most whites moved even further north.  Now Miami is the dangerous Balkans of the South.  Florida, with an exception of the extreme northwest part of the state is becoming hispanic with black ghettoes and some small number of poor whites hanging on.  On a recent trip to South Florida, I found it increasingly difficult to even shop at national chain stores and find employees who speak english. Everywhere I went, on the clock or not, I am heavily armed.  My family lives in the NW part of Florida and we are seeing the writing on the wall with the large numbers of mexican migrants now taking over small towns here as well.  So many federal and state programs give them aid that they don&rsquo;t need jobs to survive.  My church, the Catholic church, as well as other faiths, load them up at the border and bring them here.  So much that it will be a race between Calif., Texas and Florida to see which just becomes all hispanic and does their own thing with their own laws.  Whites will be like some wild beasts, driven to live in mountains, deserts and other desolate places.</p>

		<p>I like Miami. Most of Florida is lower class whites, clueless retired liberals from the coasts, or real estate speculator nouveau riche idiots with bad taste, even by McMansion standards. The Hispanic areas of the state are the best parts. They came in the 50&rsquo;s, but have been there longer than most.</p>
<p>Blacks need to realize that much of Florida isn&rsquo;t really &#8220;The South&#8221; anymore. Counter-intuitively, it&rsquo;s not a good environment for them.</p>

		<p>I just read an article about Henry Louis Gates Jr (the black professor) who is doing a special on blacks in Latin America.  In the article it points out that only 450,000 blacks were brought to the area that was to become the U.S.  The other 10.5 MILLION blacks were brought to Spanish speaking countries.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it funny how perceptions are so much the opposite of reality?  The way it&rsquo;s always presented in the media and in the social justice circles is to make it appear those nasty Americans imported a billion black people to the U.S. - when it was Latinos who enslaved the overwhelming majority and keep them down even to this day.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just waiting for the day when the US is broken up into 6 regions and most of the whites are in the Midwest or Pacific Northwest. The Hispanics have completely taken over &#8220;New Africa&#8221; (formerly known as Dixie). How will Quinisha and Dontrelle react? It will probably be like that scene in &#8220;The Twilight Zone&#8221; or &#8220;The Outer Limits&#8221; where a totally wicked woman who is incarcerated convinces the old and half blind black gravedigger that she will get him the required eye operation. He tells her that when the bell rings three times, a death has occurred in prison and he will start digging the grave. She slips into the casket with the body only to realize after the casket has been interred, that the corpse is none other than the gravedigger. Her screams are terrifying, but the audience has no sympathy. </p>

		<p>The day will come, and soon when blacks will long for the days when whitey was in charge. These Hispanics in general have a very low opinion of blacks, and when they are writing the rules the black will be given nothing.</p>

		<p>What should we expect. Jimmy Carter allowed the Latinos from Cuba to come to Florida. They have now taken over Miami. Way to go liberals.</p>
<p><br>
Well, those Cubans have really nothing to do with being &#8221; Latins&#8221;, but I agree that they have taken over Southern Florida and,I would add, most other parts of Florida. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in my 30s, but it saddens me when I hear the older posters on this board speak so highly of what Miami was like in the 50s and 60s. Sadly those days are gone forever now. Miami is pretty much a &#8220;no go&#8221; zone for any White American.</p>

		<p>Jay #23, I watched the entire Black in Latin America series, and the most interesting fact that consistently emerged was that white Latinos, mestizos, and mulattoes in Haiti, DR, Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru all look down on blacks.  Henry Louis Gates managed to dig up a few people who claimed to be proud to be black, but the bigotry that openly exists in these nations could not be hidden.  Sambo-like characters are celebrated in comics and on TV in Mexico and Peru respectively, and the interviewed blacks simply shrugged off Gates&rsquo;s protestations.  One Mexican even said Jesse Jackson should worry about blacks in the U.S. and leave Mexico alone.  <br>
American blacks are in for a rude awakening very soon.  Hispanics are taking their jobs, their neighborhoods, and their clout as an influential minority.  Those streaming up from south of the border bring their unbridled racism with them.  The reconquista will have no place for any black brethren.</p>

		<p>Free country - if they want to have all Hispanic, more power to them. There&rsquo;s no law saying they need to be inclusive. Leave out everybody else and don&rsquo;t get support from the general population. Show how prejudice you are, I have no problem with that at all.</p>
<p>By the same token, I&rsquo;d like to have &#8220;whites only&#8221; get-togethers. That would be nice too. Hope you Hispanic types wouldn&rsquo;t mind. If you do, I don&rsquo;t really care. </p>

		<p>@ Jay #23. And the media also likes to parrot on about the evil WHITE slave traders, totally ignoring the fact that the majority of slave traders were BLACK.    &#8220;Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. cites two leading historians of the slave trade, John Thornton and Linda Heywood of Boston University, for the proposition that roughly 90% of the slaves sent across the Middle Passage were enslaved by African traders and then sold to Europeans along the coast. Other leading scholars believe that the percentage is actually much higher, that only at the margins were any Africans enslaved directly by Europeans.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Hmmmm.  Don&rsquo;t recall any of these black leaders being outraged when they forced whites out of positions to make room for blacks.  Blacks&rsquo; hypocrisy when it comes to racial issues never ceases to amaze me.  Not all blacks are like this, no, but lots of them are.</p>

		<p>Blacks are going to freak out when they realize that only whites, for some reason, put up with their crummy ways. The Hispanics will walk all over them and for good reason. The blacks expect other people to go out of their way to help them and make them relevant. Other non white groups won&rsquo;t even acknowledge blacks. </p>
