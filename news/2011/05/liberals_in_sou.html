			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brad Poole, Reuters, May 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A long-simmering movement by liberal stalwarts in southern Arizona to break away from the rest of the largely conservative state is at a boiling point as secession backers press to bring their longshot ambition to the forefront of Arizona politics.</p>
<p>A group of lawyers from the Democratic stronghold of Tucson and surrounding Pima County have launched a petition drive seeking support for a November 2012 ballot question on whether the 48th state should be divided in two.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the newly formed political action committee Start our State is to split Pima County off into what would become the nation&rsquo;s 51st state, tentatively dubbed Baja Arizona.</p>
<p>Backers have until July 5 next year to collect the 48,000 signatures required to qualify for a spot on the ballot. If they succeed, it would mark only the first hurdle in a long, circuitous process that even the most determined of supporters readily acknowledge has little chance of bearing fruit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. history is replete with efforts to carve one state from another  &mdash;  from the creation of Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s to more modern misfires like proposals to partition Long Island from New York or to split California in half.</p>
<p>The last successful intrastate secession movement was the formation of West Virginia during the Civil War.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Partisan tensions have long been a fact of life between left-leaning Pima County and a Phoenix-based political establishment that has produced such conservative giants as Barry Goldwater and John McCain.</p>
<p>But the rift was heightened during the past two years as Republican Governor Jan Brewer and her allies in control of the statehouse pursued a political agenda Democrats saw as extreme, including a crackdown on illegal immigration and proposals, ultimately unsuccessful, to nullify some federal laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ballot measure sought by Arizona secession backers is a nonbinding measure asking Pima County voters if they support petitioning state lawmakers for permission to break away.</p>
<p>Before secession could occur, it would have to be approved separately by the Legislature, and by a second, binding referendum by residents of the proposed state.</p>
<p>If the Legislature refused, organizers could try to sidestep lawmakers with a statewide referendum. If both the Legislature and Pima County voters agreed, then it would be up to the U.S. Congress to grant Baja Arizona formal statehood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure sends a message to the rest of the world that we aren&rsquo;t like the folks in Maricopa (County),&#8221; he said, referring to the state&rsquo;s population center and capital.</p>
<p>But a more historical precedent can be found in Arizona&rsquo;s origins as a U.S. territory, more than half a century before statehood was granted in 1912. The northern bulk of Arizona was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848, six years before the lower portion of the territory, south of the Gila River, was separately acquired in 1854 under the Gadsden Purchase.</p>

								<h2>Pima County Secession Movement Throws Party</h2>
						<p>Thursday wasn&rsquo;t just Cinco de Mayo in the Old Pueblo, it was Free Baja Arizona day. A day commemorated ever since the Pima County board of supervisors, passed a resolution in 1987.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Start our State&#8221; movement is using the day to kick start its drive for signatures. And the movement is gathering some attention.</p>
<p>The movement supporters want to secede from Arizona and join the U.S. as the 51st state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re celebrating free Baja Arizona Day today,&#8221; said Peter Hormel from Start our State.</p>
<p>Beer, popcorn and talk of secession this wasn&rsquo;t your average Cinco de Mayo celebration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The goal is to secede from Arizona. To do that, they put pen to paper and signed petitions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even supporters say success is unlikely.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Secession supporters have their work cut out for them. They have until July 5, 2012 to collect over 47,000 signatures. If those are collected, voters will get to decide what they want to do.<br>

		<p>This would be great news if succcessful.  It would mark the beginning of the partioning of the US into ethnic enclaves with, hopefully, a white homeland.  New states followed by succession from the federal government.  Joy!</p>
<p>For those who want to &#8220;take back&#8221; the lower 48&hellip;forget it, that will not happen, we are far too far along in terms of the hispanic occupation for that.</p>

		<p>This could be a very positive move.  </p>
<p>Grouping all liberals in a separate area under their own government and own flag would mean a greater concentration of white conservatives in the remaining territory. </p>
<p>In a decade or so, all the white liberals would be clamouring to get out of the dysfunctional hellhole they created.</p>

		<p>I wish these liberals all the luck in the world in creating their new state, on one condition: the laws they oppose such as SB 1070 and the laws they demand to enact (such as the Dream Act) be enforced in their new territory. Limo libs like Ted Kennedy or Clinton love to perform multicultural experiments, but never in their own petri dish. Let these Arizonans (Bajaists?) be flooded with mestizos and MS-13 and La Eme cartel members and have their emergency rooms glutted with illegal migrants.</p>
<p>It will be an instructive lesson to compare and contrast the old Arizona with the new.</p>

		<p>Let them go!  Precedent is everything in the law, it won&rsquo;t be long until we find ourselves with this situation as well. The important thing is sculpting the language so as to give whites a fighting chance when we too wish to separate on a state then national level. </p>

		<p>The southern half of a political entity wants to break away and form a new political entity because of &#8220;perceived&#8221; repression from the northern half.  Sounds familiar.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about 1861 only.  Right across the river from me, a state in which I lived for most of the previous two calendar years, is one where there is also a serious move for statehood for the southern part of the state.  Though since it&rsquo;s not liberals pushing it, the media won&rsquo;t fawn over it.  </p>
<p>Let me give you a hint:  Illinois held an election for Governor last year.  The incumbent Democrat, Pat Quinn, who came in after Rod Blagojevich was impeached, narrowly won versus the Republican candidate, a downstate State Senator named Bill Brady.  (His running mate, who would have become Lieutenant Governor had Brady won, lives very close to where I worked in Edwardsville, Illinois, for most of last year).  Quinn very narrowly beat Brady.  But Brady won 99 of 102 counties in the state, and two of the counties he lost, St. Clair (East St. Louis, Belleville) and Alexander (Cairo), he only lost by toothskin margins, and only the black populations in those county gave Quinn his narrow wins there.  But the other county?  Quinn won that very vote-heavy county by a more than 2-to-1 margin.  You can probably guess which one.</p>
<p>That added more fuel to the fire to the Southern Illinois statehood movement.</p>
<p>If the libs get their precious state of North Sonora, then we should get our Southern Illinois, to balance out the affect on the national body politic.  Southern Illinois would be almost all white, and ethnically split between German-ancestry farmers and in the far southern part of the state, quasi-Dixierons in the far southern part, the long-time white natives having fairly discernable Mid-South accents.  A state of Southern Illinois would be solidly red.</p>
<p>As for this vote in Arizona, the one bad piece of timing for &#8220;Baja Arizona&#8221; proponents is that it will come in the same year that Arizona celebrates its statehood centennial, next year.</p>
<p>The end of the first article makes a crucial point   &mdash;   Everything in Arizona (and in far southwestern New Mexico) south of the Gila River was not a war spoil, but purchased fair and square straight up from Mexico.  So ask this of the reconquista Aztlan nuts   &mdash;   You want back the entire Southwest because we &#8220;stole&#8221; it from you.  But we keep the Gadsden Purchase because it was purchased fairly and without duress.  Fair enough?</p>

		<p>Great idea, bad idea.</p>
<p>While I support their efforts to create their liberal Utopia, we all know it can&rsquo;t succeed. You can&rsquo;t be all things to all people. How do you reconcile the demands of each and every individual? If an issue involves what&rsquo;s best for a woman or a gay man, who should be favored and why? How do you maintain a stream of money to support people who demand to be supported because of some self-perceived oppression?</p>
<p>This is where it becomes a bad idea.</p>
<p>Liberals have so many opinions that they can&rsquo;t be reconciled and the experiment will fail. Liberals can only exist as dependents feeding of a healthy host (self-respecting, responsible, productive people). Without a pool of productive people, their Utopia will fail.</p>
<p>While I support the idea on principle, it can&rsquo;t work and they will either end up moving back among productive society or they will demand we support their venture by claiming we owe them.<br>

		<p>This is a statment from the Save Our State website:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;A. Contrary to statements in the press about Start Our State, this is not a group of &ldquo;disaffected Democrats.&rdquo; Start Our State is a coalition of people from all political persuasions; therefore, we have no &ldquo;political philosophy&rdquo; per se. We essentially believe in two things. First, we disagree not only with the most extreme aspects of the Pearce agenda but also with the manner in which Pearce and the state legislature are pursuing it. Second, we want to maintain our United States citizenship and we are concerned that the Pearce agenda puts us on a path to secession from the United States&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thier entire site is ridiculous. Other than the fact that they obviously hate Russell Pearce, they`ve no structure, no political or economic model   &mdash;  -the`re just terribly upset that Arizona has had enough.   </p>

		<p>The left is always accusing rightists of being extremists who want to push back time, start Civil War II, or secede into ethnic and/or politically conservative confederacies or new nations.  So now, some of them want the same thing.  Whoopee!</p>

		<p>This is interesting in that if the liberals do succeed in doing this it would backfire tremendously. It would prove that Pat Buchanan is exactly right about the eventual balkanization of the United States, and it would prove that multiculturalism IS destroying this nation. I say let them secede and form their own state, and when they do many other parts of the nation will demand the same thing! The break up of the nation is already underway, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of how it breaks up, not if it breaks up.</p>

<p>I regard this unexpected development in Arizona as a pleasant surprise. </p>
<p>Many AmRenners have expressed a desire for a separation of, if not the races, then at least the ideologies, i.e. if we can&rsquo;t have White states and Black states, can we at least have Red states and Blue states? Many of us have had enough of the Left and their multikulti shock troops, and would like to get away from them once and for all. </p>
<p>The problem has always been that the Left would never LET us get away, as they seem to prefer the option of keeping us around in order to torture us to death. Historically, all calls for separation, secession, etc, have come from the Right. And these days the Right is, of course, severely out of favor and out of power. So such movements as a Confederate States of America in the South, or for some sort of white homeland in the Northwest, have not gotten very far. They have remained stifled, at the theoretical stage, with no very realistic prospects for implementation. Not that these ideas aren&rsquo;t good; just that they look unlikely ever to achieve lift-off in aggressively diversificated Obamerica. </p>
<p>Now, however, it seems that   &mdash;   at least in southern AZ   &mdash;   there are a lot of Leftists who are equally tired of the Right. To the point that they&rsquo;ve decided they can no longer share the same space with us. Now THEY want to separate from US. </p>
<p>And because in 21st Century West, it is the Left that invariably gets what it wants, while the Right NEVER does, I&rsquo;m very glad that among the things the Left now wants, happens to be something that WE also want. </p>
<p>This could be a win/win situation for everybody. And, as a previous poster has noted, set an important precedent on which future carve-ups at the state (or perhaps even the national) level might be based. </p>
<p>&#8220;Baja Arizona.&#8221; I like the sound of that. Please God, let it come to pass! Of course, I would personally never VISIT this new state (or sub-state, or territory, or whatever) even on a bet. I personally would never set foot there with anything less than a gun to my head. But it would still warm my heart just to know such a place exists; and that the re-drawing of maps along ethnic and/or ideological lines is no longer an impossibility but a potentially achievable reality. </p>

		<p>There are some questions that I have regarding Latinos&rsquo; desire for a 51st state:</p>
<p>1)Would the Latinos who live down there still be able to take advantage of the social welfare programs paid for by the hated white person?</p>
<p>2)Would it be all Latino or would white people still be able to live there? I lived in Tucson and the northern part, northwestern part, and northeastern part were beautiful and generally white(at least it was 8 years ago!).</p>
<p>3)Would the Latinos then want to &#8220;take over&#8221; other parts of Arizona and other states for their Reconquista?</p>
<p>4)Would our U.S. Congress vote for Baja Arizona statehood? They seem to give in to these Latinos on everything so I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it.</p>
<p>I feel these are legitimate questions that need to be answered.</p>

		<p>Peter Hormel, is that the Hormel meat company?  Is he looking to set up some sort of open territory where the labor and industrial regulations don&rsquo;t apply?  Could be a paradise for the meat packers, hundreds of thousands of desperate peons, no FDA health and sanitary regulations.</p>
<p>Follow the money.  Every time a meatpacker buses in illegal aliens to work in the plants, an entire crew of well paid Hispanic lawyers and interest group arrives at the same time.  Who funds all these advocacy groups and attorneys in those tiny Nebraska and Dakota towns?  The employers of the illegals.</p>

		<p>This is a typical reaction from liberals; if they can&rsquo;t get their way through legislation, they go to the courts; if the courts deny them recourse they throw fits in the streets; and, if they lose an election, they just recount votes until they steal it.  </p>
<p>As a final tantrum, if they can&rsquo;t get their way, they simply take their ball and go home, thus we have a propose new state in Southern Arizona.</p>
<p>By and large liberals hate democracy and detest honest debate and dissenting opinions.  They don&rsquo;t like the legislative process either.  Notice that when they are out-voted, their reaction is not to regroup and come back with better ideas and try again through the legislature. No, they pout like the children they are and sulk off feeling put upon.  After all, they <b>are</b> special and should get their way. This is the spoiled &#8220;Woodstock&#8221; generation. (Not to be confused with the Da Nang generation).  </p>
<p>Note that the &#8220;secession&#8221; they seek is not really a secession.  The real deal would be to opt for independence and become a country.  Nor are they opting to join Mexico.  This is telling, and so liberal like.  These liberals don&rsquo;t want to join a country with all the little brown people they profess to love, nor do they want to go it alone as a new county.  The latter being too risky.  What they want is a new state and continue to receive all the payoffs and goodies the rest of us will be forced to handover to the new &#8220;Baja&#8221;.  </p>
<p>These deluded arrogant liberals want to build their Utopian dream at our expense, so they can have their moral orgasms and feel superior to the rest of us.   <br>

		<p>@13 Ms. Whitey,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
1)Would the Latinos who live down there still be able to take advantage of the social welfare programs paid for by the hated white person?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Yes, because nanny statism doesn&rsquo;t work if those providing for the infantile populations have no real reason to exist as they are under separate political control.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
2)Would it be all Latino or would white people still be able to live there? I lived in Tucson and the northern part, northwestern part, and northeastern part were beautiful and generally white(at least it was 8 years ago!).<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>They call this a Salient (think Battle of The Bulge) which is a dangerous condition for both sides because the neck of the salient is vulnerable to collapse from the shoulders of units adjacent to the breach at the same time a &#8216;breakout&rsquo; can let combat formations into your rear echelon areas where they promptly begin killing the cooks, truck drivers and band members.</p>
<p>Point Being: it will not be a singular event.  It will be a justification for pushing for Reconquista overall, it will be a chink in the armor of sovereignity that becomes a salient that becomes a flooding torrent.</p>
<p>Mexicans don&rsquo;t respect lines on the map now, why should they when we show our weakness -and- give them all the sanctuary-state privileges which they will have lost forever in Greater Arizona?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
3)Would the Latinos then want to &ldquo;take over&rdquo; other parts of Arizona and other states for their Reconquista?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
4)Would our U.S. Congress vote for Baja Arizona statehood? They seem to give in to these Latinos on everything so I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Yes they would.  The Elites still very much want an NAU which begins with Mexican ports replacing Seattle/San Diego etc. as a principle means of import (and a good shot in the arm to _Mexican_ economy).  They will then build a superhighway, up into the Middle American redoubt (Mexican &#8216;free trade zones&rsquo; as sovereign territory, in Kansas&hellip;) to deliver these goods.</p>
<p>And a breakaway state which allowed Mexico to legitimately violate the borders of our nation under &#8216;every Mexican abroad is a bit of Mexico&rsquo; conditions could be easily manipulated into a situation which began just this process of forced national convergence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
I feel these are legitimate questions that need to be answered.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The only reality that counts is who has the nukes, the food production, the industry and the (Great Lakes) access to international trade to allow a white followon nation to stand up.</p>
<p>And in this, the one thing you must remember is that our enslavers are not stupid.  They know where there real work ethic and thus intelligent work product comes from.  They cannot afford to lose us.  And so they will not.  Which is why, &#8216;when not if&rsquo;, the beginning of balkanization if not fragmentation of the U.S. happens, we must be _prepositioned_ to immediate do our own carpe diem standup without preamble or other telegraphy.  </p>
<p>We cannot fragment as city states in a nation where we are isolated and outnumbered, locally.  We must do what we always have which is ORGANIZE to become a new nation.</p>
<p>And a much less gullible one.</p>
<p>Right now, we are simply not ready for that because we have an abuse victim&rsquo;s addiction to the concept that the &#8216;hurtful spouse&rsquo; as national government will somehow get better and stop beating us.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t never gonna happen folks.</p>

		<p>Baja Arizona is the best idea I have heard in a long time. Let it happen.</p>
<p>I grew up in northern West Virginia, which is very white in comparison to towns on the other side of the Ohio River in Ohio. Reason is welfare pays better in Ohio, and it is all about getting what they can from &#8220;the government&#8221;.</p>
<p>Baja Arizona will open up as a &#8220;Utopia&#8221; but will quickly plummet. No industry will locate there because of tax rates, existing businesses will leave. Forcing tax increases on residents to support the people who will flock there.</p>
<p>Arizona of old can aid in this by lowering the value of their welfare. Arizona of old should also tax workers that live in Baja Arizona but work in Arizona of old, no free ride for living in the &#8220;Utopia&#8221; but working where business is.</p>
<p>Baja Arizona with it&rsquo;s progressive mixed income housing, which we know it will have, will become a unlivable hellhole at a rate and to such an extent that could never be imagined. People will be paying property taxes rates eventually which will be equal to or exceed the tear down value of the property as there will be so little income to tax, individual or business, there will be no other option but to tax the greedy property owners who own the deteriorating properties.</p>
<p>With the Utopians gone, unprecedented changes will be able to be enacted in Arizona of old, changes that will protect the people that add value to a system, not those who just take.</p>
<p>Baja Arizona should be welcomed by Arizona of old as a dream come true. <br>

		<p>They&rsquo;re not going to be able to secede and are only going to succeed in drawing attention to mestizo refusal to assimilate, which is just one reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed into this country in the first place.</p>
<p>I would prefer, however, that they do secede.  If they think their territory will not be identical to the failed state of Mexico, where shacks and hovels are the norm, along with rampant corruption from officials, I&rsquo;d like to know why not.  </p>
<p>Mexico has been unable to reach a first world status since its inception.  How foolish are people who keep trying the same thing, but expect a different result?</p>

		<p>As much as I like this proposal, and really wish it would spread to other states, as I said above, I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if &#8220;Baja Arizona&#8221; isn&rsquo;t anything more than a pipe dream among University of Arizona liberals in greater Tucson, and the potheads that reside in that community.  I could easily see the &#8220;Baja Arizona&#8221; campaign getting a lot of secret dirty financing from the Mexican drug gang.  Cui bono?  Baja Arizona would not be subject to (northern) Arizona SB 1070 and its provisions about illegal aliens transporting dope (which the Federal courts, even the 9th Circus, allowed to stand).  </p>

3)Would the Latinos then want to &ldquo;take over&rdquo; other parts of Arizona and other states for their Reconquista?</p>
<p><br>
Just drive around the Country and see what these so-called fake &#8220;Latinos&#8221; and all other third world invaders have done. They&rsquo;ve already taken over the entire Country. They&rsquo;ve spread around so fast,faster than a plague. It&rsquo;s a fact and too visible to ignore.</p>
<p>We have an option and that&rsquo;s no longer a political one,because there will be no political solution neither coming from the Republicans nor the Democrats. It&rsquo;s way too late for this. The only solution is massive demonstrations by thousands of White Patriots to Washington,D.C. in front of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and give them three hours of time to pack and go. I&rsquo;ve been saying this for years. The people from Morocco,Tunisia,Yemen,Libya have done it. They did it when it was unthinkable that they could do it and we can do it. We must, if we care to secure our survival as distinct,civilized people.</p>
<p>All the other initiatives like State secessions,petitions to Congress,securing areas for Whites Only within the Unites States take too long and achieve nothing substantive.</p>

		<p>I would love to see this happen, although of course I can understand Americans being a little on-edge about a territorial breakup of their country. </p>
<p>I often used to get into arguments with lefties when I told them that under a free system, such as that in the US, they would be free to organise themselves and those who think like them into whatever ghastly communist/thirdworldesque societies they wish without interference by the State- at least until their NKVD derivatives started up murdering people.</p>
<p>That was never good enough for them- on an instinctive, subconscious level they realised that when they themselves had to pay for the Third World hordes they seem so eager to import, they too would end up thinking and talking like me and my ilk who would be only too happy to live in all-British society with the multicultists lying in the bed they made on the other side of a mined and guarded border.</p>
<p>So should &#8220;Baja Arizona&#8221; secede, they are going to Hell/Mexico in a handcart very rapidly indeed, especially if Federal authorities decline to expropriate the remaining states to pay for their no-doubt colossal entitlement programs. </p>
<p>Hopefully the name will stand as a warning forever more to pro-immigration progs that once Whitey has shrugged them and their imported voters off, and made them live with the consequences of their bien-pensant, University-programmed policies, there is nothing left for them but a life of subsistence farming and violence at the hands of their own footsoldiers.</p>

		<p>If this secession were successful it would surely be short-lived. Liberals cannot survive in a 100% liberal socio-economic environment without the ability to drain the resources of the non-liberals to feed to their voting parasites. Nor would they be able to live and mingle among their constituency for more than about a year. It would be a great experiment though for in that one year when harsh reality finally takes hold, about half of these flaming liberals would become consevatives.  </p>

		<p>Secession is a terrible idea and always has been.  I guarantee that if this goes through, you will see Hispanic radicals in every state coming up with their own version.  And if those proposals go through, we&rsquo;ll have 70 or 80 states, with a guaranteed large and permanent Democrat majority in the Senate.  Our nation will be captive to these wretched radical activists, with no escape, save for retrosecession back to Mexico.    </p>
<p>Larger point:  It is not &#8220;liberty&#8221; to see one&rsquo;s country ripped from under the feet and sit there helplessly.  I resent the Murray Rothbard/lewrockwell.com notion that America needs to be broken up into a confederacy of itsy-bitsy ethnic enclaves, each off-limits to whites.  No country in the history of mankind has ever allowed this to happen.  We won&rsquo;t allow secession of this sort to happen.  We stand and fight these invaders.  Like the late Sam Francis, we stand as men.    </p>
<p>None of this would have happened if Congress had not started the ball rolling in 1965 with the misguided &#8220;immigration reform&#8221; law.  </p>

		<p>A far more reasonable idea would be to have them secede from the union altogether. Then they&rsquo;ll be able to establish their own Marxist paradise and prove, once and for all, that socialism really works.</p>

		<p>Tuscon is a college town in an otherwise conservative state.  They need look no further than Boise for a recent example of why they don&rsquo;t -=really=- want to separate from the remainder of Arizona.  Simply put, their liberal utopia fails immediately without access to Republican dollars to pay for it.</p>

		<p>Just one itsy-bitsy problem with forming a new state out of an existing one: the Constitution, Article IV, Section 3 says &#8220;New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State.&#8221;</p>
<p>But liberals never let a silly thing like the Constitution get in their way.</p>

		<p>Go ahead. We of the paleoconservative mindset often think in terms of secession away from them, but under the modern liberal rules governing society, that would likely not happen, because too many brainwashed whites would resist. </p>
<p>But, if they secede from us, like everything else that comes from a liberal, it&rsquo;s deemed right and proper by the media and schools, and gov&rsquo;t, it accomplishes nearly the same thing, and is allowed to go through. What&rsquo;s really needed is for the secession to be at the level of fed instead of state, so that when their liberal pipe dreams come crashing down on the walls of reality, they can&rsquo;t readily move back into our neighborhoods, or dig into the pockets of everyone else to cover for it.</p>
