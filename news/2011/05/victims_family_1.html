<h1>Victim&rsquo;s Family, City Leaders Have Questions after Uptown Shooting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Beth Shayne, WCNC News (Charlotte), May 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Questions continue to swirl as investigators search for whoever fired shots during one of many fights in uptown Charlotte early Sunday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was one of several fights that broke out after the Speed Street celebration in Uptown. CMPD called out its Civil Emergency Unit after reporting that many large groups of people were disobeying police, flashing gang signs, blocking traffic and fighting.</p>
<p>A manager at a convenience store on North Tryon Street tells NewsChannel 36 a huge crowd swarmed the store, broke a window, and began stealing things, before running away.</p>
<p>In all, 70 people were arrested  &mdash;  including 15 juveniles. Most of the arrests were for disorderly conduct, fighting, assault, and impeding traffic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several city leaders have expressed concerns about the incident. Though it has been several years since there was trouble, it is not the first Uptown gathering marred by late night arrests. The city is anxious to put its best foot forward for next year&rsquo;s Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Mayor Anthony Foxx released a statement:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;The crime that took place Sunday morning is disturbing and unacceptable. Neither our center city nor any of our neighborhoods are appropriate places for violence. Over the last twenty four hours, our police force has been focused on getting to the bottom of this incident. I have full confidence that Chief Monroe will use all of the tools available to find and ensure the prosecution of those responsible and take preemptive actions to make sure this rare occurrence does not repeat itself. While Charlotte&rsquo;s crime rate is the lowest in 30 years, the events of Sunday night are a harsh reminder that we still have more work to do.&#8221;</blockquote>

		<p>Matt Drudge is getting really good at dog whistling.  It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that he removed the link to Free Republic on the front of the Drudge Report because five white people got on FR and started posting &#8220;racist&#8221; stuff.  (The unctuous Jim Robinson promptly deleted their accounts).  Now, if you look at the front of Drudge today, you&rsquo;ll see this story, a lot of these black crime stories from over the weekend, and you&rsquo;ll see them above the marquee.  Below the marquee at the top left is a story about the DOJ wanting to crack down on big city police departments that engage in &#8220;civil rights violations.&#8221;  Cause and effect, anyone?</p>

		<p>I see the dishonest lib spin reporters are trying hard to blame this black melee on Speed Street, which is a Nascar event.  Problem is that this event closed hours before the mobs of blacks decided to rampage through the city.  I remember about 15 years ago Charlotte used to be really proud of their &#8220;Uptown&#8221; section to the point of arrogance.  Now it&rsquo;s just another no go zone for non-blacks to venture.  Welcome to progress.    </p>

		<p>I find the statement by Mayor Foxx both ridiculous and full of lies. He claims this is a &#8220;rare&#8221; occurrence. What a joke. There is at least one, but usually 2 or 3 shootings in Charlotte EVERY week, ALL from black neighborhoods, or night clubs. He knows this is a fact, but the nation is watching Charlotte because of the DNC coming, so I guess he is trying to reassure the rest of ya&rsquo;ll that crime is down. </p>
<p>And seriously, what questions could they possibly have about this shooting? I think it&rsquo;s hilarious when they try to make out this is shocking, when actually this is just what black people do when there is a crowd of them. There is no reason. Not one that makes any sense anyway. </p>
<p>And finally, who can NOT see that while Speed Street was going on, thousands of white folk managed to have fun and gather without a single incident of violence. I suppose I should just be thankful the black crowd waited til after the white crowd left to have their usual shootout. I had friends at Speed Street.</p>

		<p> More anguished rallies by &#8220;family members&#8221; of a &#8220;youff&#8221; who has been offed by one of his homies. One might think the murders   &mdash;   this one, many in the past, and no doubt many to come   &mdash;   were all committed by crazed, White racist Kmembers. Or maybe men from Mars; I hear they&rsquo;re White racists, too.</p>
<p> While I don&rsquo;t like to make light of anyone&rsquo;s death, these situations, and the way the mainstream media reports on them, leave one wondering whether to laugh or cry. No hint of irony that these thugs, the ones killed and the ones doing the killing, are all the offspring of these &#8220;grieving families.&#8221; No hint in the story, either, what the race of victim and likely perpetrator might be. Thank God for the accompanying video   &mdash;   as if any of us were in doubt.</p>

		<p>Rush gave a recap today on all the black violence, crime and mayhem, but he didn&rsquo;t mention race.  His meaning was clear, however, without having to identify the race of the perps.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a curious development in the country today, since Obama was elected.  Rather than causing a reduction in bad behavior by blacks, it has increased substantially, from flash mobs to mob attacks to general chaos, and crime, including murder.</p>
<p>The more they get the worse they are.  I see it getting worse also.</p>

		<p>2 Negrified whites and a dozen blacks is the problem.  Something which of course the white anchor and reporter won&rsquo;t talk about as a race ratio in criminal and particularly mob psychology conditions.</p>
<p>If this second person cannot identify the shooter, and the community is so sure the murder victim was a &#8216;peacemaker&rsquo;, you can bet the fix is in and it&rsquo;s probably a neighborhood thing with the police confrontations and &#8216;gang signing&rsquo; acting as cover.</p>
<p>Short of ending the black presence at public celebrations, the only way to really put an end to this is to have video over the entire street and be able to shut down the rail transit = fast escape option at the drop of a hat so that all fleers must take readily surveilled road routes.</p>
<p>Scrambling a helicopter takes too long.  Anyone who has ever worked surveillance tells you that half the crimes you look to the video for are &#8216;historical&rsquo; because you had the camera up and running when the event took place and may not have even seen it yourself.</p>
<p>That means cameras on roof corners and streetlights.</p>

		<p>Is there really anyone around who will still make excuses for the behavior of these fiends? The &#8220;Mob&#8221; in its heyday didn&rsquo;t commit as many murders as these animals all over the country do in a week. Just consider the number of crimes like this in every major metro area where there is a sizeable Canadian population.<br>
This group is the biggest threat to the security and the survival of this country.  </p>

There are just too many stories today about &#8216;urban&rsquo; violence to comment on.</p>
<p>One reason I don&rsquo;t mind the winters in the north east is because it keeps the miscreants off the street and out of view. When the snow starts, I know I won&rsquo;t have to walk the gauntlet of &#8216;urban youth&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>Having seen a few American films of recent depicting urban unrest<br>
have noticed the obvious discrimination of casting director&rsquo;s<br>

<p>Notice they always compare the current crime rate to, say 30 years ago (post-&#8220;civil rights&#8221; era, not 50 years ago (pre-&#8220;civil rights&#8221; era) in trying to claim the crime rate is &#8220;low.&#8221; The crime rate may fluctuate, but it never falls to the level of the pre-&#8220;civil rights&#8221; era. </p>

		<p>Same thing has been going on here, wilding flashmobs consisting of hundreds of blacks swarming the tourist and shopping areas. Wouldn&rsquo;t know it from the mainstream media, though; it&rsquo;s as if it never happened, or, if it makes it into the news it&rsquo;s minimized and attributed to &#8220;youths&#8221; or blamed on the weather. That&rsquo;s right, they actually blame the weather.<br>
It&rsquo;s a nationwide phenomenon; news has been coming out about all these race based attacks taking place all around the country. People are starting to take notice despite the news blackout.<br>
Lots of those who get arrested have charges dropped in court due to problems in identifying the specific perpetrators. When people get assaulted it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint the person when groups of 50-100 blacks dress identically, wearing oversized white T-shirts and droopy jeans. </p>

		<p>This black discontent might be feeding off of the Arab rebellion. The black version is crime and the Arab is political but there are common roots between the two paths. Something similar is happening on the Hispanic side where political movements originate in South America and enter the US via Latino immigration. You can think of other examples: From China, from Israel, from India, from Canada. This whirlwind of outside influences in the US (and Canada) presents the white indigenous people, (ie. those who used to take their culture for granted as the government supported norm) with unique challenges that only whites face. Debate and political action from the white side must be allowed, recognized, celebrated, enhanced, and taught.</p>

After I made my post here, I watched out local news and you&rsquo;re right. They insinuated all this violence took place DURING the NASCAR event Speed Street. They are now actually misleading the public to cover up black violence. Soon they will be telling outright lies just like Mr. Foxx.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been preaching this for well over three years-if one can afford to move out of Black areas, do so now.  The best areas? Probably Appalachia, parts of the midwest, Rocky Mountain states and the Pac NW.  Avoid, like the plague, any urban area, the southeast, northern Illinois, the mid atlantic, and the urbanized areas of the northeast.  Our cities are dominated by black stupidity. IMO, traveling through Atlanta, St Louis, Detroit, Charlotte, Oakland, New Orleans, Dallas and many others is dangerous. We live in southern Kentucky, and I will tell you guys, I will never leave this place-it&rsquo;s heaven on Earth. All of the surrounding counties are 97% or more White.  What&rsquo;s that mean?  It means peaceful swimming pools,lakes, libraries, parks. It means schools free of disruptive black punks. It also means very little in the way of crime, especially rape or murder. Even the large cities of Kentucky are nowhere near as bad as Nashville or Atlanta. </p>

<p><br>
Yeah, I&rsquo;ll bet they are. People like them have a lot at stake in what goes down in Charlotte next year. Like whether Obama gets his four more years or not. </p>
<p>The 2012 DNC in Charlotte has the potential to be MUCH more violent than the 1968 DNC in Chicago. The left-wing rioting in &#8216;68 is generally understood to have been a large contributing factor to the Dems&rsquo; defeat that November. The thinking goes that Mr. &amp; Mrs. Middle America, regardless of how they felt about the Vietnam war, saw those nightly newscasts of hippies, Yippies, etc, running amok and clashing with police   &mdash;   and the resulting fear of Democrat-driven anarchy turned them into Nixon voters by the millions. </p>
<p>Too much black wackiness at next year&rsquo;s Convention, and Charlotte might similarly just tip the balance of the vote against a second term for Obama. </p>

		<p>A number of comments mention the &#8220;city fathers&#8221; and other metaphores for black &#8220;leaders&#8221; Fact is, the &#8220;leaders&#8221; of Charlotte are BLACK! e.g. the same race as the criminals! in fact, they ARE criminals themselves just as all black politicians are.</p>

		<p>How more absurd can black people get? 100&rsquo;s of people around and nobody saw anything? The slain &#8220;peacemaker&rsquo;s&#8221; mother even wants a witness to step forward. Good luck with that, your &#8220;Stop Snitchin&#8221; ghetto culture is their own worst enemy. Stories like this happen everyday in the US, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!</p>

&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been preaching this for well over three years-if one can afford to move out of Black areas, do so now. The best areas? Probably Appalachia, parts of the midwest, Rocky Mountain states and the Pac NW. Avoid, like the plague, any urban area, the southeast, northern Illinois, the mid atlantic, and the urbanized areas of the northeast. Our cities are dominated by black stupidity. IMO, traveling through Atlanta, St Louis, Detroit, Charlotte, Oakland, New Orleans, Dallas and many others is dangerous. We live in southern Kentucky, and I will tell you guys, I will never leave this place-it&rsquo;s heaven on Earth. All of the surrounding counties are 97% or more White. What&rsquo;s that mean? It means peaceful swimming pools,lakes, libraries, parks. It means schools free of disruptive black punks. It also means very little in the way of crime, especially rape or murder. Even the large cities of Kentucky are nowhere near as bad as Nashville or Atlanta.&#8221;</p>

I hope that no one from the NAACP or SPLC is reading this! Kentucky will be the next target or at least the counties of which you speak. They are guilty of being too White. You may have unintentionally spelled the end for S. Kentucky. <br>
