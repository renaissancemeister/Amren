			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maxim Lott, FOX News, May 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This week, Maryland Gov. Martin O&rsquo;Malley signed a bill to require the state&rsquo;s public universities to give undocumented aliens  &mdash;  generally illegal  &mdash;  in-state tuition privileges.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the Dream Act, is already the law in ten other states, including California, New York, Texas and Illinois.</p>
<p>But critics argue that the bill will give illegal aliens better treatment than Americans and legal immigrants  &mdash;  thanks to existing diversity policies at universities.</p>
<p>University of Maryland (College Park) computer science Prof. James Purtilo told FoxNews.com that, during his time as an associate dean, he frequently saw admission officers favor students because of their &#8220;undocumented&#8221; status.</p>
<p>&#8220;They favor students with special circumstances. &#8216;Undocumented alien&rsquo; would be one of these special circumstances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They help fill out the diversity picture for the admissions office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just the norm,&#8221; Purtillo added, &#8220;that obviously we need more of these students [undocumented aliens] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#8216;this student has a real story to tell&rsquo; would be a common thing the admissions officers would say. Or that &#8216;they&rsquo;re enriching the College Park experience.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, which pushed for the bill, said he thought the concern over affirmative action was a non-issue. He noted that in the current system, undocumented immigrants are discriminated against in many ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see how [they could have an advantage.] Those kids don&rsquo;t qualify for anything at this point  &mdash;  their only benefit right now is in-state tuition. They can&rsquo;t get scholarships or anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics of the Dream acts say that affirmative action is simply built into the system for most illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost everyone who would benefit from the DREAM act would also benefit from affirmative action,&#8221; Steven Camarota, the research director for the think tank Center for Immigration Studies told FoxNews.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;A state school wouldn&rsquo;t say, well, you&rsquo;re a Dream Act kid, so you don&rsquo;t get affirmative action,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I worked in admissions at a small college for a while (at Juniata, Pa.) and the affirmative action stuff just runs on auto pilot. If you check the box, you get put in the [affirmative action] applicant pool. That&rsquo;s just how it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to ask the question: Can you have mass immigration and affirmative action? Does that lead to a just social policy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Affirmative action benefits can be substantial. A study of selective universities by Princeton sociologists Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford found that listing one&rsquo;s race as &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; instead of &#8216;White&#8221; increased the likelihood of being admitted by the same amount as scoring an extra 130 points on the SAT. Compared to Asians, the study found, Hispanics receive a 240-point advantage.</p>

		<p>And Maryland legislators can NOT figure out WHY on earth for the last 10 years that the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; (read WHITE people) have been fleeing the state. The sickening articles that have been written as to &ldquo;why&rdquo; the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; flight is occurring in Maryland is ludicrous. Like the idiots are really that stupid? I don&rsquo;t think so! </p>
<p>I mean after all White people are severely discriminated against in the state of Maryland. White people are FORCED to pay for their own replacement lest they be &ldquo;racist&rdquo; They are severely discriminated against in the job market in Maryland and DC for that matter, especially if the work is Federal or State employment. If your NOT black or foreign brown, they will NOT hire a white person, unless they are openly gay! </p>
<p>Maryland ranks in the 10 top most violent states. Gee, I wonder why? Tight gun control laws due to the fact of a high non-white population. Like that solves anything thing other than making more victims out of law abiding White people unable to defend themselves against the non-whites hordes that have guns. Oh Maryland makes me so ill. </p>
<p>White people are sick of being taxed to death to pay for the non-whites hordes and sick of their 2nd Amendment Constitutional unalienable rights being denied to them. <br>

		<p>The same thing in California, poster #1. It is truly sickening.</p>
<p> California used to be a great, safe and beautiful State full of White people when I was born and raised here. If I had the money I would be out of here yesterday!  I hate it more and more BECAUSE of what we gave it away to! Nothing but mexicans and blacks all over the place. Ever have to live among them?  Or take a bus with them on it? I feel so sorry for any White kid that has to live among, go to school with, or associate with any of these groups.</p>

		<p>I would be far more willing to accept this DREAM act law if it were reciprical with other countries.  For example, Portland Oregon (my city) has a &#8216;sister city&rsquo; arrangement with Guadalajara, Mexico.  I would be willing to let Mexican nationals who have graduated from local high schools attend Portland State University at in-state tution levels IF American nationals living in Guadalajara could go to University of G at the local tution levels.</p>
<p>  When I say this to people they assume that when I say Americans I&rsquo;m talking about blond, blue-eyed surfers looking for cheap rent and cheaper tution.  But actually I&rsquo;m referring to grown-up anchor babies who are all Mexican in every facet of their lives except citizenship and are living in Mexico.  These people face more discrimation from Mexican authorities than Mexican nationals do in the USA.</p>
<p>  Everything in international relations has to be reciprical.  We extend to their citizens living here exactly the benefits and legal protections that are extended to USA citizens living in their country.  That&rsquo;s the way that the world works.</p>

		<p>I am in the middle of this battle. Comrade O&rsquo;Malley is about to<br>
be taken down. The people are massively flocking to the petition <br>
tables to take this to referendum in 2012. In this process millions of<br>
white Americans are being forced to realize that there is a<br>
deliberate conspiracy to destroy them and their way of life.<br>
In this way..this bill has been a great blessing. We will<br>
defeat the bill via referendum and hopefully begin a larger<br>
political movement.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that any American, especially white, would agree with the DREAM Act. It is just another benefit for illegal aliens at the expense of white Americans.</p>
<p>Our country has sunk so low that illegal aliens are sought after by universities. </p>
<p>We have to remember: Illegal aliens will eventually replace our Western culture and our English language. We must fight to stop this.</p>

		<p>Have you ever been to Little Africa, er, Maryland eh? </p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been to The Peoples Republic of MD before. The Apparatchiks drink their chai every day at Red Emma&rsquo;s coffee shop, named after the much beloved-round-these-here-parts puerile Marxist revolutionary, Emma Goldman. <a href="http://www.redemmas.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.redemmas.org/</a> </p>
<p>Is this what the MD WWII Korea and Vietnam vets fought and died for? So that a particularly virulent strain of Maryland &#8216;Red Diaper&rsquo; communists could weild their overabundance of political power in the Annapolis assembly, and run roughshod over common sense.</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m here to tell them Their Dream Act has become a living nightmare for us unemployed white proles who toil (or as is becoming more frequent &#8216;used-to-toil&rsquo;) in Red Maryland. A Mestizo&rsquo;s dream, though. It&rsquo;s Mission Accomplished for Stalinists. One step closer to Mugabe -run government in the Mid Atlantic.</p>

I as a white, blue eyed, light brown haired American, I could care less how much &#8220;discrimination&#8221; grown Mexican anchor babies are facing in Mexico. </p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they&rsquo;re Mexican citizens and not our problem. I doubt most Americans (including myself) would ever consider making any concessions to illegal invaders squatting in our country, in order to make an anchor babies&rsquo; life  easier in Mexico. I&rsquo;m simply not interested! </p>

<p>An absolutely awful decision. Not only will this give Maryland&rsquo;s illegals less incentive to leave, it could act as a magnet that draws to Maryland illegals currently in other parts of the country. <br>

We&rsquo;re going to have to start calling the state &#8220;Marialand.&#8221; </p>

		<p>&#8220;Can you have mass immigration and affirmative action? Does that lead to a just social policy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a question! Why, of course you can. Any system that re-distributes wealth from up to down, with the liberal in charge of the redistribution, is a just policy by definition. </p>
