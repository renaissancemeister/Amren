			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pierre Thomas, Richard Esposito, and Lee Ferran, ABC News, May 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Osama bin Laden aspired to damage the United States not only through persistent terror attacks, but also by attempting to inflame race and class tensions in hopes of tearing down the country from the inside out, according to officials briefed on the evidence trove recovered from the al Qaeda leader&rsquo;s Pakistan compound.</p>
<p>According to materials in the cache of documents recovered in the U.S. Navy SEAL raid that brought down the terror leader, bin Laden planned to specifically recruit African-American Muslim converts to carry out attacks on the homeland. The goal was to not only kill and maim in the actual operations, but to create a divisiveness that would cause more damage than al Qaeda could ever hope to do on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there were many blacks in the U.S., he wanted to capitalize on them to further the jihadi cause,&#8221; one U.S. official told ABC News. &#8220;Al Qaeda sees the black convert community as ripe for recruiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also strategy that civil rights activist and President of the National Action Network Rev. Al Sharpton said was &#8220;radical&#8221; and outrageous.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be the most cynical abuse of African-Americans and America in general,&#8221; Sharpton told ABC News. &#8220;Remember, Osama bin Laden killed blacks, whites, Latinos, everyone on 9/11.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For him to use race relations in the U.S. in a way to support his terroristic barbarism is the absolute height of cynicism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
&#8220;I think the viewpoint reflects more of a Neo-Nazi, white supremacist outlook on American whites than anything based in reality,&#8221; he [Ibrahim Hooper, National Communications Director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations] said. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s fantasy based on a fundamental misunderstanding of American society.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials: Al Qaeda Considered 9/11 Anniversary Attack</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Analysts have yet to uncover any specific, imminent terror plots, but documents did reveal al Qaeda had considered an attack on the U.S. rail system on Sept. 11, the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
<p>A bulletin issued Thursday by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by ABC News describes the terror organization&rsquo;s chilling desire to derail a train on the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no information of any imminent terrorist threat to the U.S. rail sector, but wanted to make our partners aware of the alleged plotting,&#8221; said Chandler [DHS press secretary Matt Chandler].<br>

		<p>I have heard, but not yet been able to corroborate, that the real first big effort to spread Islam in American prisons to American black inmates, outside of the Nation of Islam, was largely financed by Libya and Col. Quadaffi.  Can anyone help me out there?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I think the viewpoint reflects more of a Neo-Nazi, white supremacist outlook on American whites than anything based in reality,&rdquo; he [Ibrahim Hooper, National Communications Director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations] said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fantasy based on a fundamental misunderstanding of American society.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Look for the SPLC to tow out this line in the next few weeks.  Right after 9/11, the SPLC&rsquo;s official party line was that AQ would try and destabilize the United States by means of pulling white right-wing extremists, utilizing their common contempt for Jews, on a string.  When next to no white right wing extremists could actually be found lauding 9/11 and AQ, save a few sad sacks in the middle of nowhere, the SPLC changed their tune and said that they were worried about &#8220;white right wing extremists&#8221; using 9/11 as an excuse to call for immigration restriction.  (Gee, where would anyone get a crazy idea like that?)  So within a matter of a month, the SPLC changed from WRWEs love AQ/OBL and were cheering 9/11 b/c of their common hatred of Jews, to WRWEs hated Muslims and therefore exploited 9/11 to call for immigration control because they hate Jews.  </p>
<p>In reality, to the extent that any white Americans run off and cavort with AQ, or the Taliban, or similar groups, they are  leftists like John Walker Lindh.</p>

I think the Bin Laden race stategy actually has some merit, whereas the Neo-Nazi&rsquo;s could care less what ideology Blacks or any non-White&rsquo;s might have.  Otherwise, Mr. Hooper is somewhat correct it that such a race based issue is a misunderstanding of the -FUNDAMENTAL- American society. His error here though, is that American society has been changed at the fundamental level through massive non-White immigration and will soon (already actually) be a fundamentally different nation&hellip; where race politics is more prevalent than ever before.</p>

		<p>What Bin Laden doesn&rsquo;t/didn&rsquo;t understand is that all black people can accomplish is mayhem. They can never be used in a coordinated plan. They just act out of instinct. They see an opportunity at a certain moment and act blindly. They can never be used for thought out plans.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; is close, but gets no cigar - with his partially accurate analysis.   The part that was moderately accurate is the portion which predicted the reaction of the $PLC and the despicably evil and always dependable spewer of anti-White hatred and venom, Mark Potok and his cabal of Marxist subversives.  </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a homework assignment for Mr. Question Diversity.   </p>
<p>Investigate the ideology known as &#8216;Cultural Marxism&rsquo; and spend a few highly productive hours reading about the history and predominant ethnicity of the  group of men who founded and organized the Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism.    Then, spend a little time researching the writings of one Leon Trotsky, one of the original Communists who was heavily involved in the overthrow of Russia in 1917 and the subsequent imposition of Bolshevik, totalitarian, brutal and murderous Communism upon the Russian people and about half of our fellow Europeans in Europe.  Here is a promise:  In that research, you will find countless references to the often repeated, expressed desire of Communists and Cultural Marxists to figure out a way to use non-white racial minorities inside the United States as weapons to divide, conquer and then to eventually bring down White Western &#8216;Christian&rsquo; Civilization.    Trotsky, in particular, wrote about this in many of his missives which outlined his ideas on how to best destroy the White West.  </p>
<p>Hence,  the Cultural Marxists who came to America and who&rsquo;ve implemented this Communist, Trotskyite blueprint for the slow, systematic destruction of America appear to now be trying to cook up another incredibly Big Lie and shift the blame for what they have done to the conveniently &#8216;dead&rsquo; and certainly fake, Osama Bin Laden - an impostor who happens to now sleep with the fishes and who can&rsquo;t dispute their line of baloney.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for this misdirection, fellow White Nationalists.  Know thy real enemy.<br>

		<p>After 9/11 Osama bin Laden said that the cost of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan bankrupted the Soviet Union, and lead to its fall. He said the American occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq would have the same effect for the United States. <br>
 <br>
So far it seems to be happening. Most pay checks buy less than when Bill Clinton left office. Millions of Americans face long term unemployment. This has polarized the country, because it leads to a perception that economic policy is a zero sum game, or perhaps a negative sum game.<br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, it did not have to be this way. The proper response to Islamic terrorism is not the occupation of hostile populations that are willing to fight back. <br>
     <br>
The proper response is the more effective law enforcement that might have prevented 9/11, the successful espionage that did locate Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s compound, occasional raids by special operations units, like the one that that killed bin Laden, and occasional strikes by precision guided munitions. </p>

		<p>In the Art of War Sun Tzu wrote, &#8220;If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.  Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant&hellip; Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.&#8221; This is what Osama bin Laden did to President Bush. <br>
 <br>
Sun Tzu also wrote, &#8220;Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.&#8221; President Bush made few calculations. He obviously expected the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to be quick and easy. He thought the people of Afghanistan and Iraq would greet American troops as liberators, and quickly establish pro American, pro capitalist democracies.<br>
 <br>
Finally Sun Tzu wrote, &#8220;There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.&#8221; That should be obvious by now. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s Anti-U.S. Strategy: Exploit Minority Converts&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what the Marxists are doing, and it is effective.</p>
<p>Since blacks can&rsquo;t compete in first world societies, even when they are generously awarded entry and positions in almost everything they can&rsquo;t qualify for, they love the concept of being promoted via Marxist policy of taking what they need, while those capable contribute according to their ability.  They absolutely love Castro and Cuba for those very reasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why US demagogues so eagerly bend to every unreasonable whine coming out of the black community.  They don&rsquo;t want them to create riots or an insurgency, because it will jeopardize they wealth, power and position.</p>
<p>Going so far as to force scientists into declaring there&rsquo;s no difference in humans but skin color or that IQ doesn&rsquo;t matter and if it does it can be improved upon by manipulating the environment, are but two of the atrocious lies they promote in order to placate blacks.</p>
<p>As the propaganda from without&hellip;like the influence Osama wanted to create&hellip;.or the propaganda from within&hellip;..that the white, self-appointed elites dish out on a daily basis&hellip;..continues on I&rsquo;m wondering if these US fools ever realized how much better off we would be as a homogeneous nation, not having to placate a portion of the population that is barely out of the hunter/gatherer stage.</p>
<p>One way or another&hellip;.eventually&hellip;the diversity nonsense will erupt into chaos, and, like any natural phenomenon, conditions will revert to their natural state.<br>

		<p>Converts to Islam, no matter what color, are treated as second class citizens to be used to advance Islam. Women converts (there are probably 10 female converts to 1 or 2 men who convert) are used as breeders and as outlets to receive permanent residency and citizenship. Male converts are often recruited for terrorist operations since they are not likely to raise suspicions for being &#8220;middle eastern looking&#8221;. Female converts (especially white women) are valued as a way to stay in the US or Europe and since a man can have several wives he is very likely to bring his arranged wife (possibly a close relative) from his home country after he has gotten permanent residency. Black converts tend to gather around other black converts and very few foriegn Muslims will want to marry a black convert- man or woman. </p>

		<p>I doubt if blacks are that self-sacrificing in the interests of a common cause to be honest.  Mass-Terrorism against a dominant population is an insurgent strategy that seeks group action based on mutually exclusive (common only to one side) ideals rather than coincidental racial identity.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t have the psychology for that and haven&rsquo;t had since MLK and particularly Malcom-X.  I think a few may even realize that when whites go, so does their existence.</p>
<p>If you look at such things as flash mob robbery and wilding (or the election of a President), you see very explicit &#8216;for me?!&rsquo; immediacy of low-vestment identity profiteerism if not -entertainment- value.  Not a deep political philosophy.</p>
<p>Yes, it may be a white who gets beaten or robbed but the joy is that of the individual who attacks power, impulsively, not the group whose aggrievances are long, bitter and thought out in terms of extracting deliberate like-vengeance.</p>
<p>Remember what the man said:  &#8216;Half devil, half child&hellip;&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Children have limited long term comprehension of the consequences of their actions and terrorism doesn&rsquo;t work if you aren&rsquo;t in it to win it to the bitter end.</p>

		<p>In fact there have been several attacks or attempted attacks carried out by black Muslims in U.S. since 9/11, and there is some reservoir of sympathy from more than a few blacks for any act seen as striking at white America.   But AQ makes the mistake, like most of the rest of the world, of believing the PC picture of blacks painted by the American media and academia, and so exaggerating the influence and potential of blacks.  They are mere tools of greater political forces, not a force for revolutionary change themselves.  They live off of the white population and any destruction of the current system would doom them to abject poverty, and they know it.   The vision of blacks as a force capable of being a real threat to the system is taken from the same media fantasies that portrays them as great scientists, judges, wise-men, and leaders.  </p>

		<p>No one concerned about the growing conversion of Mexican illegals to Islam?  As with all pertinent information to white survival, this phenomena has been craftily hidden in the MSM.  A Google search will uncover some 100,000 hits on this issue, thank God for the internet.  We must worry about the NOI and others that would stab us in the back but this is another reason to shut the border and one more reason why Obama is interested in keeping the border open.</p>

Ever heard of the black muslim village of Islamaberg New York? It&rsquo;s upstate, located near Hancock.  It&rsquo;s a no-go zone for local authorities.  Who knows what goes on there.  There are other such settlements in New york State.</p>
<p>The Zebra killings were run as part of a nation wide program by the black muslims.  The Chicago headquarters mosque organized it.<br>
Black muslim San Francisco police officers notified the killers and the local mosque of police efforts to prevent the killings. The arrests were delayed for months because San Francisco black muslim police officers kept the local mosque and the killers apprised of the investigation.</p>
<p>I think that the American black muslims are more suited for these hit and run murders of Whites rather than the organized arab muslim hijackings and bombings.</p>
<p>American black muslims are much too cowardly to do suicidal attacks.  They are too disfunctional and disorganized to do anything other than street crime pack attacks against individual Whites such as the Zebra killings.</p>
<p>The only way american black muslims could be used would be perhaps unleashing them in DC for a reign of rapes and random killings such as the DC snipers John Allen and Lee Malvo.</p>
<p>But suicide bombers?  Think any american black would sacrifice him or herself?  Never!  Building a bomb workable bomb? They would have to be able to follow directions.  Behaving themselves in public so as not to be noticed by security guards?  Impossible!</p>

		<p>Muslims would love to use black and Mexican converts against the white majority; however, blacks are difficult to organize. Muslims would need to use organizations like the black panthers and blacks in the Nation of Islam. Blacks are also dumb, so the Arabs would need to do all the planning and bomb-making. </p>
<p> Muslims so what find some blacks willing to work on their cause even if blacks screw up, they can still cause damage. White people, do not underestimate your enemy!</p>
