			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Caulfield, Daily News (New York), May 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three Arizona cops smuggled drugs and humans and laundered money for a vast narco-trafficking ring, all under the nose of the self-proclaimed &#8220;America&rsquo;s toughest sheriff,&#8221; authorities said.</p>
<p>One of the moles, a female corrections officer, was carrying the love child of a cartel capit√°n, and all three were accused of leaking sheriff&rsquo;s office tips to help the ring guide smugglers, drugs and cash through the area from Mexico, authorities said.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Deputy Alfredo Navarette, 37, and two corrections officers, Sylvia Najera, 25, and Marcella Hernandez, 28, were among 12 people rounded up in Tuesday&rsquo;s sting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Navarette, a 10-year veteran of Arpaio&rsquo;s anti-human smuggling unit, was arrested when he showed up for work, and a sweep of his apartment found two illegal immigrants hiding there.</p>
<p>Arpaio said Hernandez was eight-months pregnant with the child of Francisco Arce-Torres, the operation&rsquo;s ringleader, who has ties to Mexico&rsquo;s notorious Sinaloa cartel.</p>
<p>She and Najera were busted on their way to work at the county&rsquo;s largest jail, and cops said Hernandez had nearly $20,000 on her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The smuggling ring moved $56,000 of heroin into the area each week, cops said, and each of the dirty cops played a crucial role in keeping the operation underground.</p>

I get the feeling the reason the left is going after Sheriff Arpaio is because he&rsquo;s eating away at the profits of the drug trade.</p>

		<p>Our liberal political elites are under the fantasy that the second a foreigner steps across the border, they will immediately abandon all loyalty to their family, kin, ethnicity, or race, that remain back home.    </p>
<p>Thus, hiring Mexicans to protect our southern border against Mexicans is ludicrous.  Hiring foxes to guard the hen house.<br>

		<p>I knew from the title that they were all Mexicans, of course. I also believe that most Mexican/black cops and border patrol are on the drug take or are criminals and dealers themselves.</p>

		<p>You know, the first thought that came into my mind was &#8220;They must be Germans&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>On military posts, every officer is supposed to be a mentor to a given number of enlisteds underneath him, usually in his unit.</p>
<p>This gives him the right to make snap inspections of their quarters, check on their spending habits, make sure that their kids are doing alright in school.  etc. etc.</p>
<p>If they have -anything- in their jackets which corresponds to drug or gang affiliations as a function of past crimes (itself formerly a game ender for any aspirations to enter the military) you can add things like requirements for drug screenings, counseling, on/off base restrictions and lie detector tests.  Usually your security rating is much lower.</p>
<p>YOU WOULD THINK, that the idea of employing hispanics to prevent hispanics from entering an area where 20,000 dollars was a little more than pocket money would itself be considered a dumb idea.</p>
<p>But for pities sake, at least do yourself the dignity of vetting your staff through common polygraph and financials statements and the odd drive-by on their house to make sure they don&rsquo;t have a Ferrari in the driveway.</p>
<p>Trusting White Fools and their country, soon to be parted&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for officers to get bought off. I applaud Sheriff Arpaio for catching them and putting a stop to it. Great work!</p>

		<p>You mean that all of these cops that were smuggling were Hispanic?  Say it ain&rsquo;t so.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed near the borders or police the area due to conflict of interest in the first place.  </p>
<p>Come to think of it they probably shouldn&rsquo;t be in this country in the first place.</p>

		<p>Joe Arpaio will probably end up going to sensitivity training over this one!</p>
<p>How can he let Mexican officers get caught?&hellip;he must have protected the white cops doing the same thing!  It ain&rsquo;t fair!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put them in jail, I have a worse punishment. Send them to Mexico!  Worse yet, make them move to Detroit!</p>

		<p> Yes, the controlled media was crowing over this like a cocky rooster on a manure pile. Of course, they didn&rsquo;t mention that all the accused were Hispanic. They&rsquo;ve always hated Sheriff Joe for representing the people not the privileged elites.</p>

		<p>Hispanic cops or Hispanic border patrol agents should not be in charge of anything to do with immigration issues or dealings with Hispanic gangs.  It&rsquo;s very biased. It&rsquo;s an obvious conflict of interest. That&rsquo;s why in WWII we sent Japanese soldiers to fight in Europe and sent Italians to fight Germany or Japan, etc.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do prison time as a corrupt cop.  Can anyone here say &#8220;protective custody&#8221; and &#8220;23-hour lockdown&#8221;?  Since the charges are alien smuggling and drugs, this stuff will probably end up being federal, which also means straight time and no parole (the federal Bureau of Prisons abolished parole back in 1986.)  Doing a whole lot of time rotting in a 6&rsquo; by 8&rsquo; cell 23 hours a day would not be any fun at all.</p>

		<p>Arpaio refuses to recognize that we have a Mexican problem. He believes the problem is a mere issue of legality. Are the immigrants legal or not. These criminal immigrants are not going to become wonderful law abiding citizens simply because they may obtain a paper from the government. The problem is not immigration it is Mexicans.</p>
<p>If hundreds of illegal Irish or English came to America I would have zero problem with it. The country would probably be all the better for it. I am solely opposed to third world immigration that is the real problem. It is a race issue. Conservatives like Arpaio don&rsquo;t get it. </p>

<p>IN a nutshell!  ALL so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; will NEVER admit that it is a RACE issue.  They are running like scared rabbits from that word. Did you read about Bristol Palin dating that black guy and Sarah disapproving, not because he was black, but that Bristol split up with her last beau, and Sarah doesn&rsquo;t want her dating &#8220;man after man&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
