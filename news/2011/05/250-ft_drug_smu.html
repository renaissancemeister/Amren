			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Allen, Telegraph (London), May 10, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It stretched for 250ft under the border from an abandoned building in Nogales, Mexico, to another city also called Nogales in Arizona.</p>
<p>The tunnel, which was 15ft below the surface, was discovered by US Border Patrol agents and is the most elaborate of eight found in the area since October.</p>
<p>Chief Patrol Agent Randy Hill said: &#8220;This tunnel is more sophisticated than other recently discovered tunnels. They chiselled through solid rock and then installed electricity, lighting, water pumps, and ventilation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a prime example of the risks traffickers will take and the lengths they will go to smuggle contraband into our country.&#8221; Arizona is a popular destination for powerful Mexican cartels smuggling marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines north into the United States.</p>
<p>As security has been tightened along the border in recent years drug smugglers have increasingly gone underground to evade detection.</p>

		<p>These tunnels are dug by professional miners. And THEN after the tunnels are dug, the miners disappear. Are &#8220;offed&#8221; probably to conceal the existence of the tunnel.</p>

		<p>Note that it is a British newspaper that gives this story any kind of national airing.  The US press deems it not worthy enough to bring it to the country&rsquo;s attention, even though there is much evidence to suggest the dramatic increase in the advanced tunnel techniques by the cartels coincides with information from intelligence sources that say the cartels are partnering with Middle Eastern terrorist groups, who also sell them weapons.</p>
<p>Beheadings, car bombs, advanced improvised explosive devices, all very likely have been influenced by jihadists who have been in South and Central America, moving up into Mexico where OTM (Other than Mexicans)have been caught crossing over into the US.</p>
<p>If just one terror attack can be traced to entry from Mexico, Obama will be impeached for refusal to protect the southern border.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that this tunnel was built without anybody noticing. I&rsquo;m not an engineer, but wouldn&rsquo;t you need a heavy, loud machine in order to cut through rock for such a long distance? It should have gotten the attention of the border patrol, but of course, they&rsquo;re spread very thinly along the border.</p>

<p>He should be!  But is he any worse than the Republican in office before him?  And the one before him, etc, etc?</p>
<p><b>&#8220;I&rsquo;ll bet a year&rsquo;s salary there&rsquo;s another 500 tunnels they haven&rsquo;t discovered.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>They have been discovering these tunnels for years.  No doubt the border is honeycombed with them.</p>
<p>Tunnelling through rock requires explosives and heavy machinery. Couldn&rsquo;t seismographs  easily detect such activity?  Is anybody in our government REALLY TRYING?</p>

<p>Of course. Probably the CIA gave them the tools and helped them tunnel it. As for the border &#8220;patrol&#8221;, they are on the take also and been told to turn a blind eye.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the border patrol that would notice this.  The US has technology in the sky that can easily see and possibly hear what is going on in any house in the US.  Some people know about it but most do not.  It&rsquo;s one of those open secrets our government loves so much.  They don&rsquo;t really hide it, but you will never see it in a news story.</p>
<p>Our military probably watched the entire tunnel being built from start to finish.  And that&rsquo;s assuming they didn&rsquo;t actually pay for it and give the drug cartels all the equipment they would need to build it.</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;.Obama is THAT bad.</p>

		<p>UWB Impulse SAR.</p>
<p>Ultra Wide Band Impulse Synthetic Aperture Radar.</p>
<p>You take a specifically tailored radar wavelength to impedence load whatever target you are interested in (like taking a tuning fork to a crystal) and until resonant backscatter effect penetrates the object and creates a negative-image model of what lies behind.</p>
<p>It has uses in anti-stealth detection systems, in what are called &#8216;FOPEN&rsquo; or foliage penetration systems.  And in looking through dirt/rock/concrete for voids and even people (we used it in Iraq quite a bit).</p>
<p>The Swedes first used &#8216;Carabas&rsquo; to judge flow field conditions in glaciers and were shocked to find things like WWII airplanes hidden under the ice.  The CIA then used it from aircraft as small as Cessna 172s along the Bosnia/Serbia/Albania borders during Operation Deny Flight in the 1990s Balkans to find hidden cache`s of war material being used to support various guerilla factions.</p>
<p>Last I heard, they were now using it to look for Iranian buried nuclear facilities as part of targeting for a preemptive strike.</p>
<p>The point being that, yes, you can use seismic and acoustic sensors and they are cheap by the dozen _for small areas_ as traffic chokes.  City to city, like this for instance because nobody digs under the desert for it&rsquo;s own sake&hellip;</p>
<p>But if you want to sweep a wide swath along a much large border-urban swath, you use this UWB/Impulse system to look through the rock for cavity voids.</p>
<p>Did we want to, (i.e. were it not enormously profitable to select individuals in government and law enforcement at the highest levels) we could shut down the Mexicans _overnight_.</p>
<p>That we don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t, even by cleaning our own house of pushers and users, is a sign of what multiculturalism has actually b|r|ought us to, morally.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t it grand?</p>

		<p>People are asking how could the government not notice - remember the whole&rsquo; war&rsquo; on terror is just an excuse for more power, more globalization - both Obama and Bush let in record numbers of Muslims. We refuse to profile&hellip;</p>
<p>The thinking is probably something like this - it would be racist and prejudiced to look for tunnels from Mexico because then we&rsquo;d only arrest Mexicans and that would be racist and counter to our diversity goals. </p>

		<p>How about sending some TSA screeners to the border to check out the people moving through these tunnels? Oh wait, I forget, the TSA is too busy feeling up and shaking law abiding travelers within the USA to deal with an actual invasion. </p>
