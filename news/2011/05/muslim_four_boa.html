			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), May 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Akmol Hussein, 26, Sheikh Rashid, 27, Azad Hussain, 25, and Simon Alam, 19, discussed the plan to ambush Gary Smith outside his school nearly a month before attacking him in the street.</p>
<p>A bug, which could have been put in Akmol&rsquo;s car by the security services, captures the gang discussing the plot, then praising Allah as they drive from the scene of the attack. Excerpts of the recording played in Snaresbrook Crown Court disclose Hussein setting out the plan to ambush Mr Smith, the head of religious education at Central Foundation Girls&rsquo; School in Bow, east London.</p>
<p>Hussein says: &#8220;This is the dog we want to hit, to strike, to kill.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s mocking Islam and he&rsquo;s putting doubts in people&rsquo;s minds, How can somebody take a job to teach Islam when they&rsquo;re not even a Muslim?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah Whitehouse, prosecuting, said Mr Smith taught a &#8220;wide variety of topics such as abortion, euthanasia and the role of women&#8221;. Mr Smith was ambushed by the gang shortly after 8am as he walked to the school from nearby Mile End on July 12 last year. Miss Whitehouse said: &#8220;He was targeted as the victim of this attack simply because of his position as head of religious studies at the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court heard that moments before the gang attacked Mr Smith, Hussein can be heard saying: &#8220;Does everyone remember the drill? One time, bang, bang, bang, bang.&#8221; The recording is then silent for 10 minutes while the attack takes place.</p>
<p>Miss Whitehouse said Mr Smith was kicked and hit in the stomach, on the head and in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was smashed with a brick of some sort and a rod,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He pleaded with his attackers not to kick him.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the attack Mr Smith, 37, was slashed from the corner of his mouth to his right ear and he suffered a fractured skull and shattered jaw.</p>
<p>In a second series of excerpts played to the court, the four attackers can be heard boasting about the attack.</p>
<p>Miss Whitehouse said: &#8220;They rejoice and praise Allah for the successful execution of their plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bug was not found in the car until Aug 18 last year.</p>
<p>The court was told that a fifth man, Badruzzuha Uddin, 23, a mechanic, hid bloodstained clothing at the garage where he worked. Miss Whitehouse said: &#8220;The blood on the clothes was that of Gary Smith.&#8221; DNA testing found that the clothes belonged to Hussein and Alam. Traces of Mr Smith&rsquo;s blood were found in the car.</p>
<p>The five men were arrested in July and either refused to comment or denied being involved.</p>
<p>All five were arrested again in August after some of the material recorded in Hussein&rsquo;s car was transcribed. Hussein, of Bethnal Green, Rashid, of Shadwell, Hussain, of Wapping, and Alam, of Whitechapel, all from east London, have all admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Uddin, of Shadwell, admitted assisting an offender.</p>
<p>The court was told that Hussein. a devout Muslim, had a previous conviction for drink-driving.</p>
<p>Despite his horrific injuries, Mr Smith, of Chingford, east London, has pledged to return to teaching. He needed three operations to repair his face and was in hospital for 10 days.</p>
<p>His mother, Heather, who stayed at his bedside every day, said: &#8220;His injuries were so bad I didn&rsquo;t recognise him.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Muslims love to be &#8220;mocked.&#8221;  That way, they can justify assaulting or killing the &#8220;mocker&#8221;   &mdash;   self-fulfilling prophecy.  They are primitive narcissists, possessed of the emotions of six-year-olds. </p>

		<p>Look for more stories like these, but don&rsquo;t look for them to do any good for our White Humanity.  We&rsquo;ve gone too far down the road of doom.  A strong, capable, and enduring White Humanity wouldn&rsquo;t have invited such a dangerous Arab race and there violent religion into our borders.   We deserve all the horrors they can give us.  And since &#8220;educators&#8221; are liberal elites, let&rsquo;s celebrate the poetic justice.</p>

		<p> I wonder if this is a hate crime. I&rsquo;m sure the police will agree it is and charge the victim with discriminating against the muslim religion!!!!!!!!1</p>

		<p>More devout followers of the &#8220;world&rsquo;s most peaceful religion.&#8221;  After reading the article yesterday about the Labour government&rsquo;s attempts to flood the country with Moslems I have no doubt that an armed uprising by white English people is the only way that the UK can be saved.  </p>

<p>You mean he isn&rsquo;t going to even make a statement regarding how he hopes people won&rsquo;t judge all Muslims as being like his attackers, then apologizing for his ancestors?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll never fit in with the stiff upper lip crowd until he does.</p>

		<p>The people who need to go to jail are the security services personnel who undoubtedly recorded the conversation _one month ahead of time_ and still did NOTHING.  Either to preempt the attack or acknowledge the recording.</p>
<p>Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars, right into general population and if/when you survive and get out, a minimum of 4-6 YEARS later, you never work again in your chosen profession and 20% of your pay flipping burgers or cleaning toilets is docked to pay Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>That is _obscene_.  We cannot pay taxes for police and national law enforcement agencies to sit by and do NOTHING while we (whites, christians) are attacked.</p>
<p>They work for us.  They need to remember that.  Always.</p>

		<p>Islamics and their beliefs seem entirely at odds with the European, secular, democratic, humanistic societal approach. It confounds me that they wish to live among us- why don&rsquo;t they move to established Moslem countries and live under their Sharia law? Could it be because almost without exception, Moslem run countries are nasty corrupt dictatorships where human life is of little value? From what I can see, Islam is more a sickness of the mind than a religion. The Internet seems hell bent on showing us white people the reality of our world, in little vicious snippets of truth like this one. It&rsquo;s lucky we invented it.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t the cops arrest these men for conspiracy to murder before the assault occurred?  Are the British police not allowed to do that?  They nab terrorists before the bombs go off, so why wasn&rsquo;t this man protected when the danger was clear?</p>

<p>It sure doesn&rsquo;t seem to do us much good to be armed though.</p>
<p>The laws are so convoluted against US and getting worse by the day. What you are allowed to do in one State will not be allowed in others. Keeping a gun UNloaded and LOCKED up in ones own home is now the law in most states. What good is owning a gun if you cannot get at it in time?  It has become harder and harder to even get a CCW and they are working on curtailing our right to carry at all.</p>

		<p>Mr. Smith is the head of religious education at Central Foundation Girls&rsquo; School in Bow, East London. Smith was teaching at an all-girls school so the &#8220;righteous avengers&#8221; must have heard about his insulting Islam from their daughters, cousins or sisters. I wonder how long it will be before comparative religion will be removed from British University curriculums for fear of outraging fanatical Muslims?</p>

		<p>I once decided to do some meditation in a park near Miles End tube station, near this school (I didn&rsquo;t know the area).</p>
<p>I found myself surrounded by muslim youths. Reasoning with them proved to be useless. They said meditation is un-Islamic and started to punch me while I still had my legs crossed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I quickly scrambled to my feet and put my back to a rose patch (the park was very well tended). Despite there being at least 7 of them, they didn&rsquo;t dare to attack me once I was on my feet so I escaped with a black eye and lost my phone.</p>
<p>Since then, I remind myself; a muslim area is enemy territory. I took up kickboxing.</p>
<p>The thing is, I now have a position of responsibility in a media outlet that shall remain nameless. If there is an opportunity to expose the evilness of Islam in an objective and unemotional journalistic tone, I am sure to take it!</p>

<p>I have no doubt that you&rsquo;re being ironic, but it&rsquo;s amazing the number of people who don&rsquo;t understand (or won&rsquo;t admit to themselves) that Muslims as a group don&rsquo;t come to developed countries for any other purpose than displacement of (or absorption of) the indigenous populations, with a view to annexing our societies to the universal Islamic caliphate, ruled by Sharia, as ordained by the Koran. They are here to change (or obliterate) us; not the other way round. It&rsquo;s wake-up time, folks!</p>
