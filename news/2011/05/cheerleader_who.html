<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Texas high school cheerleader who was kicked off the squad for refusing to chant the name of a basketball player  &mdash;  the same athlete she said had raped her four months earlier  &mdash;  lost a U.S. Supreme Court appeal Monday.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court ruled in September that the cheerleader was speaking for the school, not herself, and had no right to remain silent when called on to cheer the athlete by name. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court denied review of the case Monday without comment.</p>
<p>The girl, identified by her initials H.S. [aka &#8220;Hillaire&#8221;], was 16 when she said she was raped at a party in her southeast Texas hometown of Silsbee in October 2008. She identified the assailant as Rakheem Bolton, a star on the Silsbee High School football team.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At a February 2009 basketball game in Huntsville, Texas, H.S. joined in leading cheers for the Silsbee team, which included Bolton. But when Bolton went to the foul line to shoot a free throw, H.S. folded her arms and was silent.</p>
<p>H.S. said the district superintendent, his assistant and the school principal told her she had to cheer for Bolton or go home. She refused and was dismissed from the squad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal courts have also ordered H.S. and her parents to reimburse the district more than $45,000 for the costs of defending against a frivolous suit.</p>

		<p>Stories like this help us so much, we almost wish we could manufacture them.  How many of this girl&rsquo;s White friends will be so easily convinced that Diversity is our Strength, or agree that she deserved what she got because she hadn&rsquo;t done enough to atone for the sins of segregation by holding herself accountable to the beloved community of color for her unearned White privilege?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t rape her, because social and restorative justice for Holder&rsquo;s &#8220;my people&#8221; allows that White skin is all the blacks need for &#8220;consent&#8221; to sexually brutalize and destroy sacred and pure White ladyhood.</p>
<p>But we should ask, what was she doing at a party that allowed a black to enter?  Shouldn&rsquo;t she have left immediately upon the party becoming integrated? Why hadn&rsquo;t her parents taught her to boycott integrated parties?  Maybe when they write that $45,000 check, they will reflect on the failures of White Parenthood.<br>

		<p>My heart is sick today. I teach freshman composition (a critical thinking course) at a college. We just finished discussing logical fallacies. </p>
<p>My heart is sick, and I can barely hold my head up. I am depressed, and it is right that I am so. </p>
<p>I cannot hear one more liberal White (especially female) tell me anything good about blacks (especially male). Blacks have been illogically deified in this nation, in all Western nations, and Whites have been demonized, and WE ALL KNOW this is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>While discussing logical fallacies with my students, we read Hans C. Andersen&rsquo;s &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes,&#8221; concerning the &#8220;bandwagon&#8221; appeal to see the emperor as clothed when WE ALL DAMNED WELL KNOW that he is naked. I did not voice what I was really thinking: Obama/Soetero is a liar, a racist and a nefarious louse, and blacks are contributing no good thing, and I mean no good thing, to the advancement of our culture; in fact, they are destroying it more quickly than responsible Whites can repair the damage they are doing. </p>
<p>I checked other sites on the web about the above rape story. Most bloggers blame the girl and say the Supreme Court is in the right. Most of these blogs appeared on CONSERVATIVE, RIGHT-LEANING SITES and were, ostensibly, composed by educated Whites. No one mentioned race. Most referred to the rapists as &#8220;boys&#8221;, while the THREE BLACK MEN who raped this underaged girl were not boys, but men, over the age of 18. The MSM, of course, won&rsquo;t cover this story at all, and if they did, they wouldn&rsquo;t mention race.</p>
<p>White Americans, understand this: if you are watching too much MTV and thinking it cool to place yourself in a situation in which you might be accosted by black males, you will find no sympathy from your fellow Whites, especially the notorious White liberal female, if you are molested. </p>
<p>I have to go teach a class on critical thinking right now at an American institution of higher learning. I am going to pray on the way there that God gives me the strength to hold my head up because right now I am damned depressed, and I feel like I belong to the weakest, most pathetic, invertebrate &#8220;race&#8221; on the planet. Our daughters think it fashionable to place themselves in situations with untrustworthy black males, and when they get raped, they will find no sympathy from the White liberals who will blame the victims while predictably celebrating the perpetrators.</p>
<p>One last thing: I have been teaching college composition for more than twenty years now, and I have never, never, never met a competent and talented black male student who could behave respectfully or properly in class or write above a fourth-grade level. NOT ONE.</p>
<p>But, damn, yo, dawg &hellip; they sho &#8216;nuff can shoot some hoops!</p>

		<p>This incident took place in 2009, plenty of time for Bolton to be in jail for any number of things.  Do the research and determine &#8220;where is he now?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Do the honorable thing and have fund raisers to offset the legal expense.  Appeal to white people who are tired of being second rated by our government and it&rsquo;s laws.  Raising money to show the blacks &#8220;up&#8221; shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult.</p>
<p>With merit you will win.  Without merit it would be shameful.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why we Indian immigrants chose not to participate in such frivolous activities such as cheerleading; our kids focus on math and science; therefore we stay out of such trouble. Cheerleading is such a demeaning thing- If your daughter has the coordination and flexibility, why not put her in a gymnastics club which provides a more &#8220;wholesome&#8221; environment than the cheerleading team?<br>
I would be okay and even proud of my daughter wanted to pursue gymnastics on the side (as long as she maintains straight A&rsquo;s) but I would absolutely forbid her from joining any cheerleading squad- EVER</p>

		<p>While I agree this probably isn&rsquo;t the best use of the courts&rsquo; resources, I have little doubt that if races are reversed (white male assailant and black female victim), the court would would consider the case less frivolous.  In fact, it wouldn&rsquo;t even get to the courts since there would be enough media saturation and pressure to remove the white athlete from the team (see: Duke lacrosse incident).</p>

		<p>This is much about a pea-brained obsession with sports as it is a willingness to throw a white girl under a bus, because the guy who raped her is both black and a star &#8216;aflete&rsquo;. I experienced this attitude firsthand when I was in High School. </p>
<p>The fact she&rsquo;s white obviously made it much easier to dismiss her in more ways than one. I would love to see the sort of convulsions they would&rsquo;ve gone through if it had been a black cheerleader:&#8221;which way to turn??&#8221; </p>
<p>Unfortunately I bet that all or most of the school officials were white men who won&rsquo;t risk the chance of their star thug being given a bad name. </p>
<p>The courts were as callous and indifferent as they usually are when it&rsquo;s black vs white.</p>

		<p>To say I&rsquo;m disgusted with this ruling is an understatement. I have slowly been losing respect for the U.S. Supreme Court and the rest of our judicial system for years now. This just accelerates it. This politically correct manure &#8220;jumped the shark&#8221; years ago and is fast approaching insanity, if not there already.</p>
<p>I feel so bad for Hillaire S. Rakheem pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and only received two years probation (Duh!,admission of guilt!) - and she was expected to cheer for this rapist clown? Guaranteed, if she were black, this would have had a completely different outcome. And to add insult to injury, the Supreme Court expects her parents to reimburse the district more than $45,000.00 because they labeled this a frivolous lawsuit? Insinuating that a person&rsquo;s safety and self-respect are frivolous? Or aren&rsquo;t worth as much as some criminal athlete performing in an over-hyped sport in a school that obviously has no respect for Hillaire? Oh, that&rsquo;s right. She&rsquo;s white and doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p>Well, this makes our Supreme Court really racist, huh? And greedy. As I&rsquo;m sure the school&rsquo;s reimbursement played a big part in this.</p>
<p>A very ignorant and heinous decision by the Supreme Court. But I&rsquo;m not surprised, considering who Obama appointed. They&rsquo;re just upholding the socialist party line.</p>

		<p>The ruling, or decision, is a pretty clear indication of how both the Supreme Court and the nation has descended into politically correct induced hell.  I&rsquo;d bet dollars to donuts that if the assailant were WHITE, the decision would be different.  With this decision, blacks will perceive it as a license to rape anybody they wish.  Sports trumps law, and blacks playing sports will be excused anything. And you can BET Obama&rsquo;s appointees swayed the decision.  It&rsquo;s ridiculous to compel a victim to cheer her attacker.  In a sane world, the perp would be in jail, not dribbling a basketball.<br>

		<p>This has got to be one of the single sickest running stories I have seen on AR in years! In a country where hyper &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; to all non-whites at all times is considered our greatest moral act, we can turn around and be so callously dismissive of a white, teenage rape victim&hellip;and not a peep of outrage is heard. </p>

		<p>Simply unbelievable.<br>
Given that feminism is rampant where it shouldn&rsquo;t be. Given that sexual assault is RIGHTLY taken seriously.<br>
Given that if the tables were reversed (a statistical near- imposibility, since white men almost never rape black women).<br>
Given that the rate of black on white rape is so astronomically high&hellip;</p>
<p>Folks, if this isn&rsquo;t clear proof that BRA has declared full- on WAR on whites .<br>
Wake up.<br>
Oh, I forgot, you&rsquo;re the choir, and the average white american can&rsquo;t be pried away from TV, or their cowardly PC grovelling&hellip;</p>

		<p>As with the Founding Fathers, enough is enough.  When a government and its laws no longer make sense, the people have a right to revolt against the tyranny.  The whites will eventually have to form another government and country that protect and represent their interest.  Presently, most whites have become passive and submissive in being forced to support third world peoples.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the rapist should be on the team, but rather in jail.  That would solve the chanting his name issue.  Still, my guess is some of the other team members are only slightly more savory.  I would want to quit cheerleading and get away from the whole lot.  If she just must jump around and do routines for fun maybe try gymnastics.</p>

		<p>In January of 2009, the grand jury returned a no-bill on Bolton and Rountree, clearing them of the charges. To the skeptics, that confirmed that Hillaire had voluntarily lost her virginity on a pool table&hellip;<br>
 <br>
More than a half-dozen witnesses – most Silsbee High students – said Bolton had threatened to shoot them&hellip;<br>
 <br>
In November 2009 a second grand jury reinstated the charges against Bolton and Rountree. A plea agreement reduced the charge to Class A misdemeanor assault. The case against Rountree is still pending, but Bolton pleaded guilty in September.</p>
<p>The end result: school officials may not have been telling Hillaire to cheer for her rapist. She was being told to cheer for her self-admitted assaulter.</p>
<p>Maybe the broken bathroom window or death threats should have given them a clue.</p>

		<p>If whites keep getting treated this way, then violent revolution, secession or both are inevitable. Vigilante justice on the part of whites will occur sooner than later. I feel that whites should start seceding as much as they can in every way from the non-white dominated larger society. Since non-whites feel they can rape our women and girls with impunity with the full blessing of the ruling elite, the only choice we have is to separate ourselves from both, by any means necessary.</p>

		<p>Her mistake was in assuming that the system is meant to work for her.  It is not her court, anymore than it is her high-school.  That a young white girl was recruited to cheer on a squad of black rapists and thugs should have been evidence of that.</p>
<p>I hope that this case and others like it are remembered when that time comes - and it will come - when the federal courts&rsquo; writ extends no further than the Beltway.</p>

		<p>If I had a daughter of that age, I would have encouraged her to quit cheerleading and, as SunnyvaleSal said, do gymnastics instead, where there are few if any people like that Bolton kid to worry about. </p>
<p>If I had a son of that age, I would have encouraged him not to play football or basketball, for the same reason. Hockey and soccer would be OK.</p>
<p>I would also encourage my kids of that age to take up, say, swimming, martial arts, golf, or cross-country for the same reason, not to mention that these sports are far more useful for their physical fitness after high school and college.</p>
<p>Not to get too off-topic, but our society&rsquo;s obsession with football and basketball goes a long way toward explaining things like this. </p>

		<p>There will be no justice by the courts until the justice is done without the permission of the courts.</p>
<p>THEN.</p>
<p>And only then, will the likes of the SCOTUS realize the mistake that they have made in refusing to deal with just and deserving &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; cases by essentially making whites a non-entity in their own country of majority.</p>
<p>The one thing that incumbent power cannot cede is the right to judge others for taking power on their own.  For self empowerment is the utimate proof that not just the agency but the system of power is itself _unnecessary_ to the pursuit of useful necessity.</p>
<p>This does not have to mean violence.  But it does mean Separation.  And Secession.</p>

		<p>This is why the public school systems need to be disestablished -the students in them are slaves who can be ordered to praise their rapists, or to praise abortion, or homosexuality, or the devil, or whatever strikes the fancy of the masters running the schools.  Also, we would get rid of these ridiculously elaborate and expensive so-called &#8220;sports&#8221; programs, including &#8220;football&#8221; and &#8220;cheerleading,&#8221; which have nothing at all to do with the educational mission of a school and therefore have no business being charged to the taxpayers.  The U.S. Supreme Court has almost never protected the right to free speech of public school students, so the Court&rsquo;s complicity in this poor girl&rsquo;s humiliation is not surprising, even though it is shocking in the extreme.  This country is a damn disgrace. </p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Flipping through the channels on TV today OPRAH, of course, has her whole show about the Freedom Riders 50 years ago. She said &#8220;whites&#8221; and blacks rode those buses together to fight against segregation and racism and injustice..  blah blah blah.</p>
<p>She has many of those old folks now in her audience and they all talk about their &#8220;experiences&#8221; and how the &#8220;hate&#8221; (from the White population, of course) was horrible. They were attacked and beaten, etc.  They didn&rsquo;t know if they would be killed but they &#8220;kept going&#8221;. The White audience applauded these blacks and &#8220;whites&#8221; for freeing the blacks to live among us&hellip;.complete morons.</p>
<p>This article here is just one example in a million of what these &#8220;freedom&#8221; riders did to White America with their desegregation movement and wanting &#8220;justice for blacks&#8221;!  Yeah, now where is our justice FROM blacks??? This White woman is just one more White victim out of millions at the hands of blacks, since the freedom riders got their way. Hey, WHERE is OUR FREEDOM to live apart from these blacks?  Maybe we need a NEW Freedom Ride of our own.</p>

		<p>I agree with the ruling. If Hillaire has a problem with cheering for someone (and she must have known whom she might be required to cheer for well in advance of the event), it is her choice to quit the cheerleading squad. She not being &#8216;forced&rsquo; to cheer for anyone. She joined the cheerleading squad voluntarily, and she can voluntarily quit it. If anyone here would care to explain how it is possible to construe this as her being &#8216;forced&rsquo; to do anything, I would like to hear the explanation. </p>

		<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s why we Indian immigrants chose not to participate in such frivolous activities such as cheerleading&#8221;</p>
<p>Whom do you think you&rsquo;re kidding? Everything you&rsquo;ve posted on these boards amounts to little more than cheerleading for your fellow Indian colonists.</p>

		<p>In response to Comment #25:  Why does Hillaire have to bend to the rapist?  Should not the school and the court be on her side instead of the rapist?  Would you even come close to Hillaire&rsquo;s courage and strong will to try to continue on with her life after being raped/assaulted AND then dare to stand up to the rapist?  This country has gone mad in its perpetual pandering to blacks, would you not agree?  This craziness has gone over the cliff in even catering to black criminals, would you not agree?  Have you even thought blacks are not capable of functioning in an advanced society?  Do you think Barry could have made it to the White House without affirmative action?  Of course, this would be difficult to answer as he has sealed all his school records and his past and he has been a product of affirmative action all his life.  Have you even give it one thought that most of the inventions have come from white brain power and perpetual hand outs to third world peoples (blacks) come mainly from the labors of whites?  Has it ever wandered into your brain, the easiest way to destroy this country and the Western world is to flood it with third world peoples and rampant corruption in its institutions?  In conclusion, a very corrupted court system decided to punish this young girl and her family for trying to assert their rights.</p>

		<p>A Texas high school cheerleader who was kicked off the squad for refusing to chant the name of a basketball player &mdash; the same athlete she said had raped her four months earlier &mdash; lost a U.S. Supreme Court appeal Monday&hellip;</p>
<p>The girl, identified by her initials H.S. [aka &ldquo;Hillaire&rdquo;], was 16 when she said she was raped at a party in her southeast Texas hometown of Silsbee in October 2008. She identified the assailant as Rakheem Bolton, a star on the Silsbee High School football team.<br>

If someone has football and/or basketball talent everything else will be taken care of and forgiven as long as he wins games. </p>

Simple reason would help you.</p>
<p>She was RAPED. No sane- let alone decent person would tell a girl she had to cheer her rapist. The rapist should be in prison, not playing ball at her school. She has a RIGHT to be a cheerleader, but no moral imperative to cheer a sick person that did her permanent harm.  It is not she who must quit. It is HE that should be led away in shackles, and taken to prison to be treated as rapists are&hellip;</p>
<p>YOU are putting shackles on the victim. And a white girl, who was unspeakably brutalized by an African thug.</p>
<p>I hope you have no daughters, for apparently they would get no sympathy or defense from you!</p>

		<p>In case anyone forgot, according to the Department of Justice, in 2005 there were 37,460 white women raped by black men and 0 black women raped by white men.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t that the story of the century? Where are the news stories and documentaries about this?</p>

<p>Well, I totally disagree with the ruling. Yes, she may have voluntarily joined the cheerleading squad or knew that she might have to cheer for individuals  but that is not the point. The point is that she is told that she must cheer for her rapist or quit the squad. She shouldn&rsquo;t have to make a choice to give up something she wants to be in because she won&rsquo;t cheer the guy who raped her.  That is insane. The rapist, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what race he is, should be the one having to give up football. She shouldn&rsquo;t have to give up anything. He shouldn&rsquo;t even be on the team. He should be in jail.</p>

<p>She doesn&rsquo;t. She can quit the squad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should not the school and the court be on her side instead of the rapist?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rape trial finished long ago. This is a separate trial which has nothing to do with Bolton. It is purely Hillaire vs her school.</p>
<p>The rest of your post was not relevant.</p>
<p>@29:</p>
<p>&#8220;No sane- let alone decent person would tell a girl she had to cheer her rapist.&#8221;</p>
<p>And no person did. She had a choice all along: she could cheer, or she could leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a RIGHT to be a cheerleader, but no moral imperative to cheer a sick person that did her permanent harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every right comes with attached obligations. She can be a cheerleader and fulfill the obligations of cheerleading, or she can not be a cheerleader and hence not be subject to the obligations of cheerleading. What she cannot do is both demand a right and demand not to fulfill the attached obligations.</p>
<p>@31:</p>
<p>&#8220;She shouldn&rsquo;t have to make a choice to give up something she wants to be in because she won&rsquo;t cheer the guy who raped her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should a firefighter be allowed to choose not to rescue people whom he doesn&rsquo;t like? How about a doctor? Or a police officer? When you associate yourself with an organization, you are expected to fulfill its obligations. If you disagree with its obligations, the way to express this is to boycott the organization. The point is, she had this choice all along, but never exercized it, but instead complained to the court after being put in a situation which she herself could have avoided by exercizing her choice. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>

<p>The school has the greater obligation and duty to her to give her a reasonable expectation of safety and security. They are responsible for her and the interaction she has with other students during school hours. A basketball game is a school function.</p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t so worried about damaging their baby boy&rsquo;s feelings(and their chances)they should have at least had him sit on the bench while they did their own sort of investigation. They certainly find ways of doing just that if a white student is even slightly suspected of slurring a black student; they&rsquo;ll hold the student responsible for that even when it&rsquo;s off school grounds. This doesn&rsquo;t merit as much attention?</p>
<p>Are you a sports fanatic, or merely black?</p>

<p>This is not about her &#8220;not liking someone&#8221; this is about someone who committed a violent crime against her and cheerleading has nothing to do with being a cop, doctor, etc. An organization has no right to demand that one of your obligations should be to cheer the person who raped you.</p>
<p> &#8220;If you disagree with its obligations, the way to express this is to boycott the organization.

That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I said, cheering her attacker should never have been part of her obligation and to expect otherwise is insane. As far as choice, she should NOT have to choose between not being in school activity she wants to be in or cheering her rapist. She should not have to make this choice. She was the victim so SHE should not have to give up anything, it&rsquo;s the rapist who should NOT be on the team. What part of this do you not understand? She had every right to go to court and the court should have sided with her.</p>

		<p>Texas: where white women are forced to cheer for their black rapists.</p>
<p>The last anonymous post is utterly foolish nonsense.  A large part of the problem with white people is that we are too legalistic.  What&rsquo;s good for the race must always trump any law, rule or regulation.  When we look at any political or legal issue, the first concern must always be how it affects our race.  We must never support any law or ruling which is harmful to our racial interests.</p>

		<p>It is an easily verifiable fact that blacks rape white females by the tens of thousand every year.</p>
<p>It is also a fact (See FBI Statistics) that the number of whites who rape black females is so low that it is reported as Zero.</p>
<p>My second conclusion is that of the whites as they choose to call them are actually (hispanics) being counted as white for crime statistics.</p>
<p>They are only Hispanic when they need some special help.</p>

		<p>A doctor would pass someone who committed a crime against him on to another doctor. In essence that&rsquo;s what she did, by not cheering while the others did.</p>
<p>To say she joined voluntarily makes no sense. as she had no idea when she joined that she would be expected to root for her rapist.</p>
<p>If it was once&hellip;.but everytime a black athlete acts like a thug he gets a slap on the wrist, doesn&rsquo;t he? Picked up by another team, whatever. No biggee.</p>
