<h1>NAACP to Monitor Myrtle Beach for Discriminatory Practices During Black Bike Week</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Exodus News, May 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the seventh consecutive year, the NAACP will conduct Operation Bike Week Justice to monitor discriminatory practices in Myrtle Beach during Black Bike Week, the annual Memorial Day weekend gathering of African American motorcycle enthusiasts. Throughout the weekend, NAACP teams will be observing police activity and treatment of black tourists, monitoring the practices of local businesses, watching traffic patterns and fielding calls via an incident hotline.  A press conference will be held at 11:00am on Thursday, May 26th at Myrtle Beach City Hall outlining the plan for the weekend and the strategy for monitoring the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any form of racial discrimination against Black Bike Week visitors will not be tolerated,&#8221; said NAACP Vice President of Stakeholder Relations Nelson B. Rivers, III, and a native South Carolinian.  &#8220;Closing businesses or refusing to provide equal services to Black Bike Week visitors that are provided to visitors at other times of the year, not only makes no economic sense, it is against the law.&#8221; </p>
<p>In 2009, the City enacted ordinances designed to eliminate the Harley Week and Black Bike Week.  The ordinances prohibit parking lot gatherings, landscape gatherings, loud mufflers and many special events.  Additionally, the City has implemented curfew laws.  The Association will be monitoring law enforcement to ensure the new ordinances are equally and fairly applied during Harley Week and Black Bike Week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent years, the NAACP and African Americans have filed and successfully settled federal discrimination lawsuits against the city of Myrtle Beach and area businesses for unequal treatment of Black Bike Week visitors compared to those who attend Harley Week, traditionally held one week earlier and a predominately white event. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Again this year, a complaint hotline will be activated for individuals to report closed restaurants, police misconduct or other unfair treatment. {snip}</p>

		<p>If they find Myrtle Beach not welcoming then let them go elsewhere&hellip;the ultimate power of any consumer&hellip;which is what this gang is. Unfortunately their reputations precede them so what do they expect. Maybe the NAACP could tell their black brethren to try and behave, pay fot the services they receive and to use the trash cans provided. No one likes them&hellip;they should stay away.</p>

		<p>Will the NAACP have a unit to monitor black criminality and misconduct during black biker week?  I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>BTW, I didn&rsquo;t know that not being open for business was a crime.  Then again, this is the same NAACP which has no problem with the President and the HHS Secretary and the Congressional Democrats who think that not having health insurance is a crime.</p>

		<p>Do these idiots think that white business won&rsquo;t accept black money?  Trust me, the NAACP knows that businesses LOSE money during black bike week.  They want to punish SC by pushing this carnival of ghetto behavior down their throat.</p>
<p>Everyone that knows better stays away while the black thugs on stretched out gaudy sportbikes run amok tearing the city up.  I have read horror stories of unknowing vacationers having their lives put in danger and their vacations ruined.  Thug blacks groping white women, assault, rape and multiple large brawls are the daily activities.  Restaurants being swarmed then the entire bunch does the dine and dash. </p>
<p>Daytona Beach has it right.  They don&rsquo;t want black anything after years of dealing with thug &#8220;students&#8221; showing up for black spring break.  They put a halt to it and now host another bike week called Biketoberfest.  They make so much money during those few weeks that business can turn a profit the entire year.  Whites bikers = good for business.  Blacks = bad for  business.  </p>

<p>Seriously, you can&rsquo;t make this stuff up! A racist organization is going to monitor a racist event for&hellip;RACISM! Obviously blacks and Hispanics cannot be so bone stupid as to not see the hypocrisy in these types of things. This can only mean one thing: They know. It&rsquo;s not about combating racism, it&rsquo;s about pushing their ethnic interests. White people better wake up and see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

		<p>The irony here is that the NAACP is still supposed to be boycotting tourism in South Carolina over that state&rsquo;s refusal to remove the Confederate flag from its statehouse grounds in Columbia.</p>
<p>But the NAACP is calling for Myrtle Beach to welcome all these particular &#8220;tourists&#8221; even though they ignore the boycott.  The organization even expects cultural sensitivity training for local police who will be on duty during the event.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that Myrtle Beach businesses dread this coming weekend and would rather close their doors than have all these black bikers descend upon them.  Apparently there&rsquo;s considerably more misbehavior among this group than among the white bikers who traditionally appear the previous weekend.</p>
<p>It sounds like almost everyone would be happier if these blacks would select a different location for their annual rendezvous, yet in spite of its own boycott, the NAACP insists that Myrtle Beach remain open and accessible for this one occasion.</p>

		<p>For those with half a brain and access to Google, after typing &#8220;Black Bike Week&#8221; and searching &#8220;Images&#8221; it becomes clear why these events are a problem in the first place. Disobeying traffic laws, openly smoking marijuana, open container violations, DUIS, and public indecency are the milder consequences of these get-togethers. Inevitably, there will also be some fights that will result in hospitalizations, a possible stabbing, and a shooting or two. Of course, to object to any one of the above behaviours would be racist.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that the idea of a &#8220;black bike week&#8221; meets the criteria for discrimination, so who are the real discriminators here? </p>
<p>Considering how blacks go out of their way to find offense, I can only expect that the &#8220;hotline&#8221; will be ringing off the hook.</p>

		<p>I agree with the previous posters. You can&rsquo;t tell a business that they HAVE to stay open. I would oblige and hire blacks to run my shop. That way the crimes would be black on black, and I, as the store owner, would have hidden cameras or tape recorders throughout my shop. Even if it would be illegal and/or inadmissable in court, I&rsquo;d go out of my way with&#8221;extreme prejudice&#8221; to retaliate against the violators, within moral means, of course. </p>

		<p>I have to agree with most everyone that made a comment.  Equal rights is for everyone not just for Blacks.  Blacks want to be treated equal than don&rsquo;t call it Black Bike Week.  What would happen if we decided to have White Bike Week?  Hummmm, not a bad thought.  People who force other people to accept them does not work.  All it does is cause more separation.  If they came here and acted like that had some sense people would be happy to have them.  They make it about color not the white people.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone on this board would have objection to a Black Biker Week if the bikers comported themselves in a civilized manner, but when has that happened?  On Pensacola Beach this weekend, there is a Gay celebration.  The gays spend a lot of money, create no havoc, never trash the beach, and businesses look forward to their return year after year.</p>

		<p>Another example of blacks desiring only to go to where whites are, and avail of what whites have created rather than develop their own opportunities.  What is particularly sickening is that the &#8220;monitoring&#8221; is done by the NAACP, a supporter of murderers, rapists and torturers.<br>
(See their arguments against the execution of the convicted Ogden Hi-Fi Shop killers Selby and Andrews, for example).</p>

		<p>There isn&rsquo;t a way to prove that businesses closed due to Black Bike Week. You may have to serve them if they walk into your store, but they can&rsquo;t dictate to people their times of operation. If everyone with a business decided to all go on vacation at the same time; who could prove they did it to refuse service to black bikers. </p>
<p>Off-topic:these guys really better hope they don&rsquo;t meet hardcore white bikers while exhibiting their haughty attitudes.</p>

		<p>I live there and know many black sport bike riders, generally a good group and well behaved people and even they dislike the happenings of black bike week which includes the usual dine and dash antics, shootings, knifings, the usual black women fighting in the streets over &#8220;dey man&#8221; and accosting white girls and out of town blacks accosting everyone!! The usual thing for black riders that live in MB is to BBQ and have parties in their own homes and stay away from the in town happenings. I would also mention that Myrtle Beach has a fine professional police force as too are the local sheriffs&rsquo; deputies and S.C. Highway patrol officers. I won&rsquo;t be there this year either since I am in the North West mountains of Afghanistan near the Iranian border, AGAIN!</p>

		<p>I am a biker that regularly attends motorcycle runs and rallies. I have never attended an event that was was not open to all people and motorcycle brands. The Black Hills Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota is the largest rally in the world and is open to anyone. While most of the attendees are white Harley Davidson riders, there are minorities at most venues, campgrounds and downtown shops. Last year there was even a concert by rapper Ice-T. Would most bikers like to attend a White Bike Week? That would be a resounding YES! Will that ever happen? Of course not because that would be racist in the US. Can blacks have their own rally that excludes other races? Yes, because&hellip;.(I sure would like the NAACP to finish that sentence)</p>

<p>And the city can also be responsible for payroll,overhead,and other operating costs,as well as picking up the tab for any inventory shrinkage that occurs. Not to mention damages caused by&hellip;oh&hellip;let&rsquo;s say a brawl on the business premises,for example.</p>
<p>An alternative plan would be to explain to the NAACP that since discrimination,to them,trumps the bottom line,then the NAACP ought to more than happy to pay for the items already mentioned,and any other costs that can be tied to this wonderful celebration of diversity.</p>

		<p>Philadelphia has a similar problem with what&rsquo;s ironically called the annual Greek Picnic.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Greek Picnic&#8221;   &mdash;   try to find a Mediterranian in the bunch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an event that draws huge crowds of Black college fraternity members, students, hangers on, and other assorted Africans.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the crowd reassembles on South Street, a well known Center City thorofare known for it&rsquo;s restuarants, bars, and funky shops that attracts large crowds of mostly white, mostly peaceful people.  </p>
<p>And so what happens year after year?  You guessed it.  Thousands of blacks swarm all over night time South Street bringing with them the inevitable crimes that must follow: fights, assaults, theft, robberies, and often wholesale riots with significant destruction of property.</p>
<p>So what did the wise store owners start to do?  You guessed it.  They simply closed up shop until the unwanted guests went home.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see any legal resason whatsoever that compels a business owner to open up his establishment to its potential destruction. </p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned the NAACP can take a long walk off a short pier.</p>

		<p>If I own a pizza parlor or small store and decide I want to take Memorial day weekend off to spend with my family, or on vacation, or just sleeping in, what right does the NAACP have to tell me that I have to stay open to serve black bikers?  What if I have a heart attack and my family closes the store for a bit, would I have to prove to the NAACP that I was too ill to serve them on May 20th?  Since when does a private organization or municipality have the right to tell me what hours I MUST be open?</p>
<p>Blue laws and ABC laws restricting hours that a business can be open or when they can sell alcohol have been around forever but now whites, who must do business with those they would rather not when open must now STAY open when they prefer to stay closed?  The NAACP is now Lord and Master in a new feudal society?</p>

		<p>- From what I´ve seen Harley riders are white, tattooed, overweight retired pimps and beatniks and their wilted though buxom hussies. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but they are not usually a problem. Heresaround the Hell´s Angels even do an annual toy run for children with cancer.</p>
<p>I have no idea what &#8220;black bikers&#8221; are like, but if they have to threaten businesses with lawsuits just to stay open, I think I get the picture.</p>

		<p>Interpretation:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to bolt the doors, shutter the windows and move the stock to the cellar. Hordes of bad-behaving blacks on motorcycles are headed your way. But protecting your livelihood and and your person against imminent danger is against the law. </p>
<p>When black bikers invade Myrtle Beach, SC, White business owners are forced to keep their doors opened and their shelves stocked. The racist abuse suffered by White business owners is the outcome of laws purported to end discrimination against blacks. Black Bike Week, May 26-28, is currently underway; a time to stay away form Myrle Beach. </p>
<p>and &hellip; </p>
<p>COLUMBIA   &mdash;   The NAACP on Friday sued a Myrtle Beach restaurant, claiming three black patrons were refused service during a biker rally last year in violation of their civil rights. </p>
<p>But the owner of the Pan American Pancake &amp; Omelet House said that his employees do not discriminate against anyone based on the color of their skin. &#8220;I highly doubt it,&#8221; said Constantine Leftis, 52, who immigrated to the U.S. from Greece in 1978 and has run the restaurant for 25 years. &#8220;&hellip; We&rsquo;ve never had an issue.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This must be a huge dilemma for the business owners in Myrtle Beach. Although it would be hard for the NAACP to file any lawsuits against those who close their businesses, the business owners who close their businesses run the risk of finding them vandalized and looted after Black Biker Week is over. On the other hand, it would be very dangerous and unpleasant to keep the business open with black bikers visiting from all over the country.</p>

		<p>Whites should give them a taste of their own medicine.  Video and document their public drunkeness, public urination, public indecency, vandalism, threats, intimidation, theft, etc.  Video the diners who won&rsquo;t pay their bills.  Call the police for every infraction, give them the videos.  Send videos to newspapers.  Post videos online.  Show videos to local politicians and business leaders.  Get license plate numbers.  Whites can and should monitor too.  Maybe they should hold the next event in Charlotte.</p>

<p>&#8220;In 2006, the NAACP claimed success in concluding every federal discrimination lawsuit they had filed in Myrtle Beach for complaints during bike week events from 1999–2003, against the City of Myrtle Beach, and restaurants that included Damon&rsquo;s Oceanfront and Barefoot Landing, J. Edward&rsquo;s Great Ribs, and Greg Norman&rsquo;s Australian Grill, as well as the Yachtsman Resort Hotel. In a settlement with the city, the police department was required to use the same traffic pattern on the city&rsquo;s main boulevard for Black Bike Week as they did for Harley Bike Week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, the problem shouldn&rsquo;t be insurmountable.  Maybe the restaurant owners could talk the city health department into temporarily shutting them down?  That should give them a bullet-proof defense against any lawsuit.</p>
<p>As for the black bikers, why do they insist on going where they know they&rsquo;re not welcome?  Why don&rsquo;t they try Detroit or East St. Louis, where they would fit right in and be treated like family?  </p>

		<p>When I was growing up in the old South, I think a black on a motorcycle would have been considered &#8220;uppity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that the system in place then may have kept decent blacks like #17 Skip mentions from enjoying cycling (thanks for an interesting post, Skip), but all in all there&rsquo;s a lot to be said for the old system.</p>
<p>It was a much better system for whites of course, and possibly even overall for blacks too, since blacks had much more stable families and communities then. They behaved themselves much better under that system, both to our advantage and to theirs.</p>
<p>I have a friend who lives in Biloxi, MIss., and that town has a problem similar to Myrtle Beach&rsquo;s with Black Spring Break, I think it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impediments I find to other whites accepting our views is their very understandable feeling that each individual should be accepted or rejected on the basis of their own individual character, and not rejected because they are of the same race as a large number of other persons whom anyone would choose to reject.</p>
<p>And so there is no receptivity to the notion of curbing the behavior of some blacks by curbing the behavior of all blacks, as was done in the old South.</p>
<p>When younger, I held that view very strongly myself, but over time I came to understand that as a practical view it just doesn&rsquo;t work. There seems to be no practical way of separating the good from the bad, of somehow devising a system that allows free rein to the decent blacks while curbing the troublemakers.</p>
<p>Why would anyone object to living in a neighborhood integrated with fine black families whose presence caused no increase in crime or incivility? (There are good reasons, having to do with humans&rsquo; natural preference to be with their own kind, but I don&rsquo;t want to get diverted at the moment).</p>
<p>Well, the fact is, there is no way the presence of such families in your neighborhood will NOT lead to increased crime and incivility, because their presence provides cover for other blacks to enter your neighborhood and do damage without being seen as intruders from the moment they enter the neighborhood.</p>
<p>And when push comes to shove, even the nicest of blacks will in large number feel attachment to the interests of their own race.</p>
<p>Whites today like to think of everyone as being an individual. But in the real world, all people except whites act not only as individuals but also as members of their group. We need to point out to other whites the various ways in which people of other races do this. (The overwhelming black vote for Obama is maybe the simplest illustration of the fact)</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I know it is outrageous, but restaurants have been successfully sued just for being closed when black folks wished them to be open.  The fact that they were closed to all would-be patrons (white as well as black) did not matter.  See this link:</p>
<p><a href="https://dawlegal.com/news.html?id=6" rel="nofollow">https://dawlegal.com/news.html?id=6</a></p>
<p>This paragraph from the article gives the essence of the plaintiffs&rsquo; case:</p>
<p>&#8220;Plaintiffs alleged that the defendants closed the restaurants during &#8216;Black Bike Week&rsquo;, but remained open during another May motorcycle event at Myrtle Beach attended by mostly white visitors and motorcyclists.&#8221; </p>
<p>Note that the restaurants were closed to everybody (not just blacks) during Black Bike Week.  The timing of the closure was cited as grounds for a lawsuit.    </p>

<p>You obviously don&rsquo;t have much experience with blacks. They ACTIVELY seek out places to disrupt White people, those &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; being a good example. You&rsquo;ll never hear of them happening in black areas of town. Besides, they know that if they  have their &#8220;black Bike Week&#8221; in Detroit, E. St. Louis or Oakland, their chances of winning a ghetto lottery go way down. Can you imagine the reaction of the blacks in those three cities if Whites decided to go there for a &#8220;White Bike Week&#8221;?     </p>

<p>July 4th traditionally was the top week for Myrtle Beach but that took a back seat to Memorial Day weekend festivities that have all been curtailed and now with the bogus lawsuits against eateries by the black male black mailers and naacp whites are staying away in droves.</p>
<p>This is clearly nothing but a premeditated deliberated wonton orchestrated attempt at damaging not only the state of SC who is despised as we know but also whites in general who vacation at this resort city that has millions on Memorial weekend and will suffer major losses that makes these Africans smile with delight. </p>

		<p>So according to that racist hate organization known as the NAACP the good people and business owners of Myrtle Beach must subject themselves to rape, murder, assault, theft, obscenity, skipping out of restaurants without paying, racial slurs, and all types of sickness and decrepitude at the hands of these black thugs and like every bit of it or get sued. This is supposed to be America, not some third world cess-pool that caters to criminals rather than honest citizens. However the hate mongers of the NAACP hate whites so bad that they would destroy America just to get even with whitey not even giving it one thought that they are also destroying themselves. I call this sickness (racism to the 20th power!) The NAACP is so racist that Webster must put a new word in the dictionary just to describe them. If the NAACP thinks actions like in the above article is going to stop racism they are really clueless. If anything! it&rsquo;s this kind of stupidity that will set blacks back 200 years.  So what,s next????  maybe the next time a black breaks into your house you will have to help him carry out your stolen goods to his stolen van or the NAACP will sue you,  or perhaps when a black rapes your wife you must hold her hands down to keep her from fighting back and assaulting the black thug or the NAACP will sue you.  Oops! I didn&rsquo;t mean to give the NAACP any ideas!    </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you are located, but I encourage you and everyone here to do some updating on the subject of motorcycle gangs in America (at least).  They are increasingly being filled by returned vets with their &#8220;enforcers&#8221; (really a kind of body guard troop) being made up for former special ops personnel.  </p>
<p>I am a rider and have been since I was a teen, born in 1952.  I am originally from Northern California, and I know the history of the clubs including the Hell&rsquo;s Angels.  The influence of London&rsquo;s Christian oriented 59 Club, with its original program of image softening via charitable work, has been adapted, sometimes, by varying degrees.  But I think what the overall trend is telling us is that the hard core groups are becoming more racially aware, and more militant.  But they also seem to be biding their time, taking a more defensive posture.  I have little doubt that they are students of Chittum&rsquo;s Civil War 2, since Chittum and they have a hard core military/mercenary background.<br>

		<p>Is there an annual gathering of whites for fun and meeting? It doesn&rsquo;t have to be about motorcycles although I guess many whites would consider riding to be part of the fun weekend. First, get whites to gather together, and then activities, speeches, parades, would develop over time. It could start small. I&rsquo;m sure many whites, especially locals who can drive home at the end of the day, would appreciate even just a few white contacts. Maybe all that&rsquo;s needed is for some respected person to announce the location.  </p>

Thanks for the link explaining the lawsuit re keeping businesses open.  Too many civil suits in this nation are settled, and thus terrible precedents are created concerning people&rsquo;s everyday rights.  Too many enterprises simply pay off plaintiffs to save the costs of a trial.  In this case, a judge may have found that the plaintiffs had no case.  Hopefully, some other party will push this issue into a courtroom.  And, hopefully, someday, some U.S. Supreme Court will find that private enterprise can discriminate in any way it wants, including racially!</p>

		<p>I moved to Myrtle Beach in 2008. I am married to a black man and have mixed children. We are amazed how this group acts. I feel the bikers get a sort of bad name. The real culprits of this weekend are the people who come by car. They are everywhere doing whatever they want. Your children either have to stay inside or see things that make you want to vomit. I have to say that this gathering does not represent Black people on a whole. It is disheartening to know that elsewhere there are upstanding black citizens some of whom we are honoring on this Memorial Day who have a bad name because of actions of a single weekend. I also think the NAACP is way out of line here. It does nothing to help its cause by supporting this rally.</p>

You ask whose idea was Black Bike Week.  I always assumed events like this, such as Freak Week, originated with the blacks themselves.  Surely any city knows full well what will happen when hordes of blacks pour in!  I don&rsquo;t know the details right now, but some cities have managed to make them feel so unwelcome that they&rsquo;ve scheduled the festivities elsewhere or disbanded a particular event.  And by unwelcome behavior, I mean things like strict curfews or closed establishments. </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;Compounding the organization&rsquo;s anger is that fights and skirmishes - including an armed confrontation between Myrtle Beach police and white biker gangs - have occurred during the Harley Week event, but not during Black Bike Week, yet businesses continue to cater to white bikers and refuse to serve black ones.<br>
     In 1994, one complaint states, a portion of Ocean Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in Myrtle Beach, was closed for an entire afternoon to control fighting between the Pagans and Hell&rsquo;s Angels motorcycle gangs.<br>
     &#8220;Despite these problems, resorts and business in the Myrtle Beach area, including Molly Darcy&rsquo;s on the Beach, have continued to offer service and cater to the bikers who attend Harley Week,&#8221; the complaint states.&#8221;</i></p>

According to simple justice, the Myrtle Beach restaurant bigots should be forced to serve our law-abiding and polite black motorcyclists.</p>

<p>Yeah, there are no confrontations between police and black bikers because the police walk on eggshells around them. They have a much wider range of behaviors that are tolerated. Many of their fights are probably underreported. </p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks will be blacks&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember hearing MB waitress saying that the black bikers were poor tippers, and rude and obnoxious customers. I think the restaurant owners are only interested in making money, not enemies. No other black customers are denied service the rest of the year. Restaurant owners close to only avoid problems and conflicts. Why should they be required to be open? What happened to freedom of association?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a girlfriend way back in the &rsquo;70s in Sacramento, CA.  She was pretty redhead, and a sweetheart.  She had given her black counselor a hug at graduation (I saw it).  She got a job at a restaurant nearby.  She used to come home angry, sometimes nearly crying due to the abuse the black female customers would heap upon her, and then hardly tip. Then, she had her purse stolen while shopping at a fabric store that got held up by some black guys.  I was just glad that she only lost her purse.  In a year of so, this little white idealist had been converted to a full on &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting what a little education in realism can do. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The NAACP will conduct black bike week justice&#8221; to oppress Whites in Myrtle beach. If I owned a business, I would close up shop and set cameras and guards on my place of business. I would then get in contact with a good lawyer and take NAACP to court if they sued me. They expect settlements, they expect intimidation tactics will scare business owners who think they will get less revenue if they are branded &#8220;raysi$$&#8221;. Resturaunts would hurt less from a board of health shutdown than from black bike week.<br>
 Someone mentioned that the NAACP Is supposed to be boycotting Businesses in south carolina. It may seem counter intuitive, but the NAACP Knows that letting blacks go into a store takes more money away from a business owner than simply boycotting it. The blacks that will enter a store will &#8220;boycott&#8221; by taking inventory and not paying.<br>
The NAACP Is using some truly fascist tactics in trying to oppress White people.<br>
 The words &#8220;tyrannical&#8221; and &#8220;draconian&#8221; only begin to describe this &#8220;discrimination&#8221; monitoring.</p>

Why would anyone object to living in a neighborhood integrated with fine black families whose presence caused no increase in crime or incivility?</p>
<p><br>
Problem is, no matter what the jobs or how high the income of the black families, crime always goes up no matter how many bishops, preachers, politicians, sports stars, musicians police chiefs, prison wardens, school superintendents and other high ranking black civil servants move into a neighborhood, whenever blacks move into a neighborhood, crime increases and the schools are destroyed.</p>
<p>Look at Pittsburgh, Lancaster and Palmdale Ca.  3 brandnew suburbs that were marketed to civil servants.  The majority, overwhelming majority of the residents of these cities are black civil servants.  The schools are dangerous he//holes. The crime<br>
rate, inmcluding the standard black domestic violence and child abuse is quite high compared to White suburbs where the income is substantially lower.</p>
<p>Black sports and entertainment people are nororious for their loud parties drug habits and crimes committed by both themselves and their guests in the most expensive neighborhoods in the country. </p>

		<p>South Carolina now has excellent &#8220;castle doctrine&#8221; and &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; self-defense laws. White business owners, employees and residents should arm themselves and invoke the 2nd Amendment whenever and wherever necessary.</p>

<p>Total nonsense! I was there, I have many friends in BOTH organizations and any fighting would have been on a personal basis and not on a club basis. In &#8216;84 a similar happening occured in MB and several thousand members of bike clubs showed up and the reason was that some &#8220;temp hires&#8221; police stopped, arrested and were totally out of line with several members of the HAs and Pagans and on release were told by these same fools that &#8220;we don&rsquo;t want your kind here&#8221; so mandatory calls to attend MB bike week the following May were made and it happened! also totally peaceful even though several thousand were wearing their colors though it did back up traffic to Conway as the various members lined Hwy 501 into MB sitting on their bikes with their backs to the road making a gigantic block as people took pictures, walked along taking pictures of members and their bikes, but no trouble. Blacks on the other hand, ARE trouble.</p>

Great video! Love the displays of &#8220;Christian&#8221; brotherhood for the Homies. Whenever I see a man bleeding and unconcious in the street my first instinct is ALWAYS to rifle through his pockets while laughing at him. PS - NOTE: THE ONLY PEOPLE WILLING TO TALK TO THE POLICE WERE AN OBVIOUSLY LOST WHITE COUPLE!</p>
