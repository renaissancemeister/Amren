<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Ohio woman convicted of killing her month-old baby daughter in a microwave oven was spared the death penalty and sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Arnold intentionally put 28-day-old Paris Talley in a microwave and turned it on after a fight with her boyfriend. The defense argued that someone else was likely responsible for the baby&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Medical experts testified that the baby died quickly after her temperature reached between 107 to 108 degrees Fahrenheit. They said she probably was in the microwave for more than two minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;She died because she was overheated,&#8221; said Dr. Marcella Fierro, retired chief medical examiner for Virginia. &#8220;She was cooked.&#8221;</p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.komonews.com/news/national/122698644.html">Pa. Mom Charged In Death of Baby Found in Suitcase</a></h2>
						<p><small><em>Komo News, May 26, 2011</em></small></p>
<p>An emaciated 14-month-old girl apparently died of &#8220;nutritional neglect&#8221; before she was stuffed into a suitcase and put in a neighbor&rsquo;s trash can, according to police who charged the mother with homicide.</p>
<p>Tania R. Coleman, 20, of Erie, was being held without bail Thursday after identifying herself as the mother as police canvassed the neighborhood. Coleman is pregnant and has two other girls, ages 2 and 3, authorities said.</p>
<p>The other children were examined and appear unharmed, authorities said. They were placed with Coleman&rsquo;s relatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The body was discovered by firefighters who noticed the suitcase while responding to a kitchen fire nearby.</p>
<p>Heavy rains Monday had washed the suitcase down the street after an unsuspecting neighbor removed it from the trash can, according to police and neighbors.</p>

		<p>I wonder if there is a social factor here.</p>
<p>Something like a failure to raise a child being such a stigma that a black woman refuses to acknowledge it and so goes into a &#8216;family annihilator&rsquo; mode as a kind of subconscious reset to a more childlike identity.</p>
<p>It would certainly help reinforce the WHITE concept that having kids before you are _mentally_ ready to do so is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Which brings up another point.  These two clearly aren&rsquo;t overfed but if the nation&rsquo;s diet is producing such extreme obesity in blacks and we know high fat/high protein diets drive puberty, could it be that controlling diet is a good way to keep blacks away from the breed-to-live approach to welfare existence by delaying the onset of hormonal changes?</p>
<p>As long as we have to pay for the incarceration, it is our problem&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s about the best &#8216;cure it before it strikes again&rsquo; face I can put on this kind of sickness.<br>

		<p>It seems amazing how many black women kill their children because they&rsquo;re mad at the baby daddies.  Is that the only way these women can think of to get back at these men?</p>

		<p>I have never seen data by race on who murders their children most or least often. I notice that the mainstream media is rife with stories of white women who murdered their children (Susan Smith, ad infinitum) but are blacks more pathologically likely to kill their children? Is there even a word for this phenomenon? We have patricide, fratricide, matricide. What do you even call this?</p>

		<p>Yes, but the very few times Whites do a similar crime &#8220;Susan Smith&#8221;, it is National news for years but these 2 will go away in a week, if even mentioned in the MSN. The blacks will continue bringing up Susan Smith and say how Whites kill all their babies. It will be &#8220;China and Tania&#8221; who?</p>

<p><i>I have never seen data by race on who murders their children most or least often.</i></p>
<p>Child Trends Databank, using CDC data reports: </p>
<p><i>Black infants are substantially more at risk for homicide than are other infants. In 2007, blacks had an infant homicide rate of 16.5 per 100,000, while Hispanics and whites had rates of 7.3 and 6.6 per 100,000, respectively.</i> </p>
<p>See Chart here:  https://goo.gl/MMtz9</p>
<p>And from Anon #1:</p>
<p><i>could it be that controlling diet is a good way to keep blacks away from the breed-to-live approach to welfare existence by delaying the onset of hormonal changes</i></p>
<p>The ONLY thing that will work in these cases is a requirement that ANY female dependent upon government assistance of any type be fitted with an IUD as a condition of receiving assistance.</p>
<p>As Jared Taylor himself has stated: </p>
<p><i>Those on welfare&hellip;who depends on your tax money simply to stay alive, do not have the right to bring yet more children into the world for you to house, to feed, to clothe, to try to educate&hellip;For as long as you are dependent on society&rsquo;s handouts you should not have the right to have three or four more children.</i></p>
<p>Hear, Hear, M. Taylor!</p>
<p>The progressive income tax discourages productive Whites from having children while welfare policies financially reward non Whites for having large broods   &mdash;   welfare policies financed by White American taxpayers.</p>

		<p>Side note: It took 3 trials to convict her.  </p>
<p>If Miss Arnold had simply aborted her child, no one would ever have known or cared.  That baby would be just as dead as it is now, but Arnold would be a free woman.  Could our laws, on a matter such as this, be any more hypocritical?  </p>

		<p>#3 &#8221; We have patricide, fratricide, matricide. What do you even call this?&#8221;<br>
It&rsquo;s called infanticide. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extant across all cultures and times for different reasons and at different frequencies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure these types of posts really make the point Amrenners want to make, that is separation of races. This is more an argument for making contraception and abortion services widely available. My own opinion is that we should pay low IQ women and men to get sterilized before they have children instead of paying them to reproduce as we do now.</p>

		<p>This used to be an apocrypha told about the hippie babysitter on LSD. Killed the baby by putting the child in a microwave oven. NOW it is known to be true that this is done. And done because she had: &#8220;a fight with her boyfriend.&#8221; A fight with her boyfriend so the response is to cook the baby in the microwave. Just a level of intelligence astounds me. </p>

		<p>Another point about the Susan Smith situation: The controlled Bolshevik media said she was a monster not because she killed her children, but because she accused a black man of kidnapping them. In their evil minds, &#8220;dissing&#8221; black people is worse than murdering white children.</p>

		<p>@18 Bon,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Me too!&hellip;.But just try not paying your federal/state taxes that support these hideous programs and the government&rsquo;s overseas wars and see what happens!<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Imagine what happens though when multiple municipalities start to fail and there is no money for basic civil services or a bailout because the Fed is broke too.</p>
<p>It will happen when the Chinese lambourghini flashes it&rsquo;s lights in the passing lane of the world economy, sometime around 2016-2018.</p>
<p>And the world oil standard switches to the RMB.</p>
<p>If you revert to a barter economy in white areas, _the doctor_ says whom they will treat and for what.  Because greenbacks will be fire lighting materal.  Which is why whites need to get together and be ready to break off.</p>
<p>I _so_ hope that Mexifornia and it&rsquo;s liberal plague go first.  Because what the feds _should_ do to make Cali come into line with any attempted bailout amounts to utter cutoff of all social entitlements and doubling of income taxes to around 70%.  That should be enough to send them over the edge into attempted withdrawal/realignment with Mexico, assuming the latter lasts another 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Any Federalist wrath will thus hit them first.</p>
<p>That will be our signal.</p>
<p>And if Obama is still in office, I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes that there are now -three- Americas, the middle of which owns 1/3 to 1/2 of our nuclear forces and 150,000 troops 10,000nm too far away in Korea, Europe and SWA to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be out West when it happens Bon.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback.  </p>
<p>Pity how few realize the condition and vulnerability of the US dollar, how utterly worthless it is, how close the American economy is to collapse.  A colleague told me the other day that she thought buying precious metals is for &#8220;fools.&#8221;  Believing in the strength of the American dollar is for fools.  </p>
<p>Yes, it shows the power of the media to lull us into thinking the economy is improving, the jobless rate is falling, gold will soon drop precipitously if not be &#8220;worthless.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is already a lot of bartering going on around here in S. California among Whites   &mdash;   cash talks as well.  We know that Asians, Armenians and Persians look for ways to rip us off and Mexicans do shoddy work.  I&rsquo;ve told my neighbors when asking for referrals that I only want WHITES on my property.  They understand completely.</p>
<p><i>Don&rsquo;t be out West when it happens Bon.</i></p>
<p>Thanks for your concern and don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t thought about this at great length.  This is very difficult for me as I am a Native Born Californian and love my state as much as others love Alabama, Idaho, the Carolinas or Delaware; but I am well aware of what is happening to us, as much as I despise it, and know that White Californians are becoming an endangered species surrounded by hostile, jealous, White-hating, non-Whites.  I often get the feeling they are waiting for the signal to attack; they are certainly being primed for it by the media, government and academia.</p>
<p>I also have elderly relatives that have no one else, I worry most about the elderly here, especially those living on small, limited pensions.  They are the most vulnerable.</p>

This is very difficult for me as I am a Native Born Californian and love my state as much as others love Alabama, Idaho, the Carolinas or Delaware; but I am well aware of what is happening to us, as much as I despise it, and know that White Californians are becoming an endangered species surrounded by hostile, jealous, White-hating, non-Whites. I often get the feeling they are waiting for the signal to attack; they are certainly being primed for it by the media, government and academia.</p>
<p>I also have elderly relatives that have no one else, I worry most about the elderly here, especially those living on small, limited pensions. They are the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>I agree with you, Bon..</p>
<p>I grew up in CA and still live here. I am one of those &#8220;elderly&#8221; who have to eke out a living on my SSA. I have nowhere to run to. My grown children also have to live here with their kids(to my dismay) They have nowhere to run to and couldn&rsquo;t afford to move, either. </p>
<p>I love the CA that USED to be when I was growing up. I love America the way it USED to be when I was growing up. It is no longer OUR State or Country and it is hard to comprehend how low we have sunk in just a short time span. But then, I have always known our race has an enemy that keeps chipping away, while we slumber.. I have always spoken out when I saw what was happening to our nation, whether it be the Civil Rights movement, desegregation, 1965 Immigration Act, Womens movement, etc.. It is all about demographic changes, or DELIBERATE race replacement as I call it.</p>

&#8220;Google Channon Christian. The MSM ignored her too.&#8221;</p>
<p>STARR,<br>
I&rsquo;m right with you. That has got to rank with the most horrible, vile atrocities in the annals of American Crime. I still haven&rsquo;t been able to forget her and Christopher. It&rsquo;s as though I knew them personally. <br>
I&rsquo;d love the opportunity to get to those savage bastards. I could think of tortures for them that would make Vlad the Impaler cringe. <br>

		<p>We have all heard of Casey Anthony, Susan Smith and Andrea Yates because they fit into the MSM&rsquo;s un-protected race category. But I bet you my last dollar that 95% of Americans have never heard of China Arnold or Tania Coleman. The MSM goes to great lengths to hide and down-play the acts of the most violent race on the planet. The MSM is our true enemy.</p>
