<p><cite>White Identity</cite> is Jared Taylor&rsquo;s first full-length solo opus since 1992&rsquo;s <cite>Paved With Good Intentions</cite> {snip}.</p>
<p>Taylor notes that by today&rsquo;s definition of what it has supposedly always meant to be an American, every US president up to JFK would be deemed a virulently hateful white supremacist merely for expressing the sort of group instincts that remain uncontested-even loudly encouraged-among nonwhites to this day. He says American society&rsquo;s downward slide was greatly enabled by {snip} Gunnar Myrdal&rsquo;s landmark sociological tome <cite>An American Dilemma,</cite> which posited that white racism was the primary (if not sole) cause of black poverty. Nearly ten years later came Gordon Allport&rsquo;s <cite>The Nature of Prejudice,</cite> which proposed the idea of &#8220;contact theory&#8221;-that racial and ethnic tension were caused by a <em>lack</em> of contact among divergent racial groups rather than, say, unwanted, coerced, and persistent contact in cramped quarters while competing for dwindling resources. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} [Taylor&rsquo;s] open challenge for anyone to explain what benefits diversity has brought us beyond a wider selection of restaurants remains unanswered. He presents a devastating case that forced integration has been a titanic failure as well as a direct cause of cultural Balkanization and national decline. In neighborhoods, churches, prisons, and school cafeterias-everywhere that they aren&rsquo;t forced by law to mingle-the seemingly intractable natural tendency is for ethnic groups to self-segregate.</p>
<p>Taylor cites the work of Finnish researcher Tatu Vanhanen, who posits that ethnically homogenous societies are far less conflict-prone than &#8220;diverse&#8221; ones, as well as Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, who, against his better wishes, concluded {snip} that individuals in &#8220;diverse&#8221; societies tend to be less happy, trusting, and far more alienated than those in societies founded on ethnic kinship.</p>
<p>Taylor spends several pages documenting a growing, and almost entirely unreported, violent race war between blacks and Mexicans in California {snip}.</p>
<p>Taylor argues that the stubborn persistence of ethnocentrism and a tendency to favor those who look like us are the result of deep-rooted natural tribal instincts rather than artificial racist indoctrination. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Taylor sees special danger in the severely unequal application of cultural taboos regarding racial pride. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Taylor relentlessly documents sickening heaps of hateful and genocidal anti-white rhetoric that in many cases not only goes unpunished but is instead rewarded by politicians. {snip}</p>
<p>The mainstream media is likewise criminally complicit in maintaining such dangerously unsustainable double standards, perhaps most profoundly when it comes to interracial violence. If white youth anywhere in America were doing anything along the lines of &#8220;polar bear hunting,&#8221; you&rsquo;d never hear the end of it. {snip}</p>
<p>For the time being, the majority of American whites have been terrified into silence by a single word that is wielded like a taser against any Caucasian American who refuses to submit to the program. The word &#8220;racist&#8221; is used exclusively against whites to immobilize any stirrings of group consciousness. It is swung like a hammer at the skull of any white person who still has the nerve to say they aren&rsquo;t profoundly ashamed of their own skin.</p>
<p>But if current trends continue and whites slip into despised-minority status as they most certainly will, the game will change. {snip} A tipping point will come where group consciousness will seem far less loathsome than group extinction.</p>
