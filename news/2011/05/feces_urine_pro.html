<h1>Feces &amp; Urine Problem in Downtown El Paso</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KTSM-TV (El Paso),  May 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s disgusting, unsanitary and it&rsquo;s going to leave you shaking your head. Migrant workers have turned a Downtown El Paso alley into a gigantic toilet.</p>
<p>Human urine stains the walls and feces is piled up in an alley that&rsquo;s just blocks away from the Convention Center and other tourist hotspots.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&rsquo;t let you go inside, you have to go anywhere. That&rsquo;s why El Paso is like that,&#8221; Roberto Miranda said.</p>
<p>Miranda is a migrant worker. He sleeps outside of the Farm Workers Center, like at-least one-hundred other people, and he waits for work in the early morning hours. The disgusting alley is around the corner from the center. Miranda admits the migrant workers us it as their personal toilet.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He told us the migrant workers have no choice but to use the restroom outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t want to do that, but all the time when we want to go inside they say &#8216;no,&rsquo;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>We questioned the Director of the Farm Workers Center. He told us the people that urinate and defecate in the alleys are not migrant workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the people in the street are homeless people,&#8221; Carlos Marentes said.</p>
<p>Marentes told us the alley isn&rsquo;t his problem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tonight we&rsquo;re still waiting for the City of El Paso to tell us who is responsible for the cleanup.<br>

		<p>El Paso is immediately across the rivulet mistakenly named the &#8220;Rio Grande&#8221; from Juarez. Irrigation has drained so much water from the river that it scarcely deserves the name nor does it serve as much of barrier between two nations (reclaimed land from the river bed has been turned into a Mexican park). Supposedly, the river is wider and deeper as one travels further Southeast. </p>
<p>El Paso is becoming a hot mess. During the recent college bowl season, visitors to the Sun Bowl game in El Paso were urged not to leave Texas to visit Mexico. With drug cartels out for blood in Juarez and human waste lining the streets of El Paso, it may be time to call out the military to beginning patrols along the US side of the border and sweeps throughout the city. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I hate New York, getting buzzed into a Mc Donald`s, then the lady wouldn`t let me back in the bathroom  after lunch before I walked out, knowing how tough the next one would be in that town&hellip;. Actually I wanted to start a law in my city that IF you have a business, Not home based, you must have a working and accessible restroom. </p>
<p> What I really really hate, is when you go into a national chain gas station and the (pick your ethnicity) clerk says &#8220;The bathrooms are out of order.&#8221;  He just doesn`t want to clean them!! So now I just walk into the &#8220;Non&rsquo; working bathroom and close the door, when they guy bangs on the door I flush the toilet and tell him I just &#8220;fixed it&#8221;  </p>
<p> I had one case in my twenties when I walked up and asked the 50ish White clerk to use the bathroom. He said it was for customers only. So I bought some motor oil. THEN, he still wouldn`t let me in because I was on foot and just &#8220;buying stuff to use the bathroom.&#8221; So I walked out back and started to urinate on the tire rack. He shouted at the 15 year old trainee to stop me. I told the kid, &#8220;Don`t come near me!!&#8221; The old man yelled at him again and the kid told the old guy, &#8220;YOU stop him!!&rsquo; That`s when I knew I had won and walked off laughing&hellip;</p>
<p> Moral of story? I don`t need &#8220;Your permission&#8221; to urinate, you can let me or suffer the consequences&hellip;</p>

		<p>I doubt even putting in outdoor toilets will clean the place up. They will soon end up being as dirty and smelly as the alleys are. I have seen a mexican (illegal) take a leak outside (in FULL VIEW) the apartment he was staying at as I was driving into my apartment complex down the alley.  These people live like they do in Mexico and they bring their &#8220;standards&#8221; and &#8220;culture&#8221; to us.</p>

		<p>We Are Better Than This-</p>
<p>Kibera (Nairobi) Slum Africa<br>
https://goo.gl/r9Cd5</p>
<p>Mexico City Slum<br>
https://goo.gl/MvDBp</p>
<p>Mumbai (India) Slum<br>
https://goo.gl/eSnL8</p>
<p>Do you get the theme here?  Where some races of people go, there too will you find certain types of environmental hazard.  They wallow in it.  ALL the biggest slums in the world are in the &#8216;developing&rsquo; part of it (IQ sub-80).</p>
<p>Because whites won&rsquo;t put up with such nonsense.  At least they didn&rsquo;t before they went stupid, like in El Paso.</p>
<p>So why is this dangerous?  Because bugs chase the smell of food and feces with equal abandon.  Dysentary, Typhus, Typhoid, Dengue.  A perfectly clean person can thus get infected because, miles away, because &#8216;flies believe in diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In North Africa, during WWII, the German Afrika Korps was _defeated_, at El Alamein, because they didn&rsquo;t know what the British had learned: you absolutely must cover and lye all latrines so that the flies don&rsquo;t get in and then come land on your food.  Result: When Monty sent his men through the minefields, more than half of the Germans were down with extreme diarrhea and dehydration in 110` heat.</p>
<p>Perfectly sanitary soldiers with otherwise great field discipline, flat-backed through simple carelessness in one area.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how whites would handle such a situation, if they were so unfortunate to be stuck living in these conditions.</p>
<p>Someone would be nominated leader.  All hands, aye.  Every man would then tithe a buck or three, every day, at the check cashing store, to either rent a porta potty or get a _plastic trash can_, some bungee cords and some garbage bags, maybe a 5 gallon paint can for a urinal.</p>
<p>Everyone would draw straws and once a day someone who hadn&rsquo;t pulled the duty the day before would empty the old and put in a new liner before taking the urine can to someone who was paid to let us pour it down a toilet.  The feces bag would be put in a dumpster.</p>
<p>All cans to be kept lids-on unless in use.</p>
<p>_There would be no drunks_ because we would not want them around us.</p>
<p>This is UNSAFE.</p>
<p>And if the Mayor of El Paso won&rsquo;t figure out a way to end it, he should be replaced.  We&rsquo;ve already had our bouts with endemic diseases people, no need to repeat the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>How about the illegal &#8220;migrants&#8221; themselves being the ones responsible for cleaning it up?? Make them ALL work on Sundays cleaning up their alley toilets! Don&rsquo;t we always hear about what hard workers these people are and will do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do? Well let them do this job NO America would or should do!</p>

<p>Real cute, Tim&hellip;.NOT! You cannot find a bathroom anywhere? I doubt your stories. What you claim sounds rather stupid on your part. I have been places where one has a hard time finding a restroom, but NEVER would I go on a tire rack, etc. just to get &#8220;revenge&#8221;.  At least find a hidden shrub or something out of view if you cannot hold it anylonger! Most businesses do NOT accomodate the PUBLIC for use of their bathrooms FOR A REASON! Get a grip!</p>

<p>Mike, I know what you&rsquo;re trying to say but these people aren&rsquo;t Spanish any more than we&rsquo;re English ( I know that YOU know that and I&rsquo;m not trying to be condescending). My students many of whom work part time in service businesses like restaurants will tell me about the &#8221; Spanish&#8221; guys with whom they work. I always ask them from what part of Spain are their co-workers. They always respond that they&rsquo;re from Mexico or El Salvador etc. Then I tell them that these people are no more &#8220;Spanish&#8221; than THEY are.<br>
 Believe me this country wouldn&rsquo;t be having any problems with immigrants who were truly &#8220;Spanish&#8221;. They&rsquo;d be Europeans and that&rsquo;s what we need more of.  I personally wouldn&rsquo;t mind a few hundred thousand women who look like Penelope Cruz walking around.</p>

		<p>Americans have no idea what the third world is like. When I was in Lima, Peru, you had to carry toilet paper with you. I was in the National Museum downtown and had to use the restroom. No toilet paper! Even in the clinics and hospitals, if I had to take a break and use the bathroom I&rsquo;d have to ask one of the staff for toilet paper. They&rsquo;d bring out the roll and I&rsquo;d take what I needed, then they&rsquo;d put the roll away. </p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re out in the boondocks, forget it! I learned quickly to cut back on the coffee and soft drinks until I was safely back at the hotel. I really had no desire to go running into the sugar cane fields to relieve myself.   <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no one has caught on to what this is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something.  If you lived in an apartment complex and this was the alleyway that was next to where you live, would you stay there?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Soon, the whites will leave that area.  Their property will be bought up for a fraction of what it is worth.  The alley will then be cleaned up (or not&hellip;.depending on who lives there afterward).  And these people will repeat the process somewhere else.</p>
<p>Two things to learn from this.</p>
<p>1) The real reason they are doing it.  Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the media lies presented above.</p>
<p>2) The real problem isn&rsquo;t them.  It&rsquo;s us.  Every normal place and time in history, this behavior would result in violence against those doing it.  But it doesn&rsquo;t here.  And too many whites feel smugly superior about that for some reason.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing but cowardice.  Cowards often face one groveling, degrading experience after another.  I&rsquo;d say being knee deep in feces qualifies.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He sleeps outside of the Farm Workers Center, like at-least one-hundred other people, and he waits for work in the early morning hours&#8221;</p>
<p>As a northerner, what struck me when I visited El Paso was the effect of a hot climate.  People could sleep outside year round.</p>
<p>This &#8216;day laborer&rsquo; problem stops at the snow belt.  Up here, we don&rsquo;t have a problem with itinerant, unemployed migrants.  Our economy runs fine without them, and wages are better by necessity.</p>

		<p>Parts of Los Angeles are reportedly much worse than this. Sidewalks in some parts of downtown LA are filthy with human waste, Cops and workers going there sometimes put on rubber overshoes or plastic bags to keep the filth off their shoes. And Trailer parks are worse; the conditions the inhabitants have recreated are identical to the Worlds worst slums. Anyone visiting those places can see for themselves half-naked Children who don&rsquo;t wash themselves, walking around with bloated frames from atrocious eating choices, not starvation, living amidst mounds of fetid trash and stagnant water. A picture the media absolutely never displays for US citizens to see how they&rsquo;re &#8216;adapting to society&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I`m heading out of town and sense an attack from someone on my policy of &#8220;When ya gotta, ya gotta&#8221; never mind where, so I thought a little clarification is in order. What I hate, what I`m REALLY rebelling against, is this.<br>
 I`m tired of being treated like a third world citizen in a first world country. Usually by third world citizens themselves who come from a country so over populated that they bring THEIR rules (no, You can`t) to my neighborhood. Where I come from, where I grew up, using the restroom was a simple courtesy extended to anyone who needed it. Now, because people can`t be expected to not pee on the floor right next to a toilet, no one gets to use it. Sorry I refuse to buy into that thinking. A couple of final thoughts. I posted recently on the explosion of &#8220;urine bombs&#8221; on highway roadsides. I said it was due to clerks who refused the legitimate use of their bathrooms under their charge.  And I remember an incident that happened when I was a kid. A charming little girl in my Catholic school class was soo brow beaten into the whole &#8220;the Nun decides when and where&#8221; routine that she wet herself rather than be subjected to the teachers scrutiny and derision. When I got home and told my mom about it she said, &#8220;You don`t have to ask permission, I`m giving it to you in advance&hellip;&#8221; you just raise your hand and TELL them you are going to the bathroom. I never forgot that&hellip;.</p>

<p>Gee, Doesn`t that just prove my point. You doubt I can`t find a restroon, you don`t believe my stories, then Validate my position with your own comments, &#8220;Most businesses DO NOT&hellip;)!! </p>
<p> I challenge anyone, especially You Anonymous,  to start keeping a record of how many times you are refused that courtesy&hellip; Or see a sign saying &#8220;Out of Order!&#8221; P.S. In that particular case, Yeah it was revenge, but it was also the only place of concealment on a major boulevard at a time when most other businesses were closed. AND It was a gas station where I had just paid for the privilege, and been refused for in the clerks words, &#8220;being on foot!!&#8221; </p>

		<p>I wish you would keep your discussions rational.  Fact is, we all have to &#8216;go&rsquo;. If I, a mature white woman, had to desperately go and there was no toilet to be found anywhere, I would use the alley too. And so would all of you, because you do not want to pee in your pants. Now to address the real problem. </p>
<p>Nobody is interested in doing that and finding real solutions. also, men are more pigs than women. A man will stand and pee against a wall.  My husband hated shaking a minister&rsquo;s hands who came out of the stall and never washed a hand. In a restaurant in Austria, males and females had to share a sink for washing hands. I noticed men coming out and never washing their hands. All women did.  If you do not want this mess you have to provide means for people to relief themselves. What in blazes do you expect them to do?  At least they are going into an alley that now is toilet alley. </p>
<p>I once took my daughter to the airport very early on a dark winter morning.  Driving through a residential area, she had an attack of diarrhea due to travel nerves. There was no business open, no restroom anywhere,we would not make it to the airport, it was getting desperate. I stopped and she darted beside somebody&rsquo;s garage.  I am sure the people were not pleased, probably cussed at the pig who did that, never realizing it was a desperate young girl. What should she have done? What would you have done? <br>
 <br>
So you have lots of people, no bathroom and hot climate. Awful, just awful.  </p>

<p>Maybe so, but it is usually out in the woods, not in downtown Charleston, WV. I have the occasion to drive through WV from time to time, but have never seen anyone openly using the john on Kanawha Blvd or Maccorkle Ave. (2 major roads in Charleston). </p>

		<p>Normally I would say that the city should build some public restrooms - businesses shouldn&rsquo;t have to shoulder the burden of providing places for people to go.</p>
<p>The problem is, these migrants would simply destroy the public restrooms in short order.</p>
<p>If you go to Mexico, you see why public facilities are so few and so bad. Anything public gets wrecked.</p>
<p>Here in Los Angeles, the second biggest city in the country, we have one of the biggest city parks in the country, Griffith Park. A wonderful city park in the second biggest city in one of the leading countries in the world - and the bathrooms are almost unusable. They&rsquo;re either flooded from clogged pipes or simply completely destroyed with broken toilets and stalls ripped out.</p>
<p>Why is this? Because most of LA&rsquo;s Mexican immigrant population lives in apartments. On weekends Griffith Park serves as their back yard. They don&rsquo;t seem to get that destroying public property only hurts themselves. Probably because they don&rsquo;t actually pay any taxes, so they have no sense of ownership.</p>

		<p>I read the memoires of a British soldier once.  He wrote of a training film that showed the travels of a fly from a piece of feces to containers of food.  The one fly flew all over an army camp and then the neighboring town infecting contaminating food that would be eaten by thousands.</p>

<p>As Varina said above, most Americans have simply no idea of what the third world is like. In many places, toilet paper (where there is any at all, and it&rsquo;s often newspaper) is simply thrown on the floor. This is customary.  I&rsquo;ve seen places which have planks on the floor so you don&rsquo;t have to wade through the urine which is several inches deep. And the stench would be enough to keep you from even going inside at all. </p>
<p>Also, in the third world, nothing seems to work.  Plumbing doesn&rsquo;t work, water doesn&rsquo;t run, toilets don&rsquo;t flush, and doors don&rsquo;t close. What&rsquo;s more, nobody seems to mind! They just accept it.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that they come here (or to Europe) and think they have found Paradise!  Some naive posters here advocate turning off the welfare and then the invaders will automatically go home.  No way!  Even without the welfare and benefits, this is still heaven compared to where they came from. They will never leave, except at gunpoint.<br>

<p>Gee, Doesn`t that just prove my point. You doubt I can`t find a restroon, you don`t believe my stories, then Validate my position with your own comments, &ldquo;Most businesses DO NOT&hellip;)!!</p>
<p>I challenge anyone, especially You Anonymous, to start keeping a record of how many times you are refused that courtesy&hellip; Or see a sign saying &ldquo;Out of Order!&rdquo; P.S. In that particular case, Yeah it was revenge, but it was also the only place of concealment on a major boulevard at a time when most other businesses were closed.

<p>Have you ever worked in a store, etc. where there is a bathroom for employees only?  Why is that, do you suppose? Why don&rsquo;t you ask the clerk or owner of such business?  They cannot afford to let customers into their bathrooms! They stuff the toilets with toilet paper, paper towels, flooding the whole bathroom and floors, urine and the &#8220;other&#8221; on the floor and in the sink, and that is just the beginning!  How would you like to be the one assigned to cleaning up other peoples nasty, sickening habits? </p>
<p>In most chain supermarkets here, they have to keep the bathrooms locked and you have to go to the service desk to ask for the key to use the bathroom. Do you have to ask why the stores have to do that?</p>

		<p>Human waste disposal is a significant part of the reason why medical/sanitary conditions are so much better in (most) of the US than in the third world. When waste is freely spread around, it is much easier for cholera, hepatitis, etc to spread.</p>
<p>The guys who keep harping about how superior Asians are, will be amazed to find out that in China, this sort of thing occurs everywhere, from rural farms to giant metropolises such as Shanghai and Beijing; in fact, children are encouraged by parents to just &#8220;go&#8221; outside if they are already outside, instead of seeking out a toilet. Even at supposedly national treasures, such as the Great Wall, and the Forbidden City.</p>

<p>No, I know why&hellip; What I am saying is I refuse to be treated like someone who can`t be trusted to not clog up a toilet instead of just using one. One other thing that annoys me, You know my name, but please don`t use it to address my directly unless you are willing to tell me yours. That puts me at a disadvantage.

		<p>I once was sitting in my car in a park of a large city that I use to live in, in S Ca. The park was located on the east side of the city, where I use to live and where there is a large population of Hispanic people. Two Mexicans in a car, in the row ahead of me suddenly got out of their car, unzipped the zippers on their pants, whipped out their peckers and both simultaneously took a leak right there on the parking lot asphalt right besides their car, all within 50 yards of the park restroom. I got out of my car and chastised the driver and pointed to the restroom. Also after every weekend when there were large gatherings of these Hispanic/Mexican people who would use the park, there was always, without fail, trash littered all over the park, even though there were numerous trash cans located around the park within easy walking distance from the park picnic benches. These people are not the cleanest people on earth. </p>

<p>I work with a lot of Chinese nationals here on temporary visas.  They have told me all I need to know about Chinese toilets.  </p>
<p>The reason Chinese children are afraid to use them is because they don&rsquo;t have water and the flush system.  They are basically latrines with huge mounds of feces.  The feces doesn&rsquo;t bother the children, but the enormous maggots covering the mounds of feces frighten them.  They are afraid the &#8220;monsters&#8221; will crawl up on them.</p>
<p>Sewers, pipes and water systems are expensive.  But covering the waste with earth has been known for thousands of years. I think lye is made from ashes.  Millions of Chinese still use coal and wood fires for cooking and heat.  The ashes could be used either to make lye or to cover the waste.</p>
<p>On the news today is a story about organic cucumbers from Spain being infected with e.coli.  Considering the vast numbers of Africans and Arabs working in Spanish fields, one can see exactly how the e.coli got into the cucumbers.</p>

-As someone who has been to a number of different cities of varying size in China over the past decade, spending 1-3 weeks each visit, I can tell you that not once did I see a toilet which lacked flushing water, and had maggots. The type you describe may well exist in some rural areas which probably rely on outhouses like we had in the US 100 yrs ago in our rural areas, but the most common toilet you see traveling China is a porcelain &#8220;squat toilet&#8221;, with flushing water. Many are even automatic flush toilets nowadays, and many restrooms have restroom attendants walking around cleaning floors, etc. In most hotels and other international-aspiring facilities, you will see common western toilets. </p>

		<p>Tim,  you should not take the owner&rsquo;s refusal as a judgement upon <i>you</i> personally.  To them, you are just a face, a mere stranger. They only know that the inconsiderate, slovenly,  (even malicious) public tends to make of mess of the washroom.</p>
<p>However, I DO agree that once you bought something, you were a customer (since that was the understanding to use the restroom). If they still denied you the restroom key, then you should have demanded an immediate refund! </p>
<p>That would have made them think twice. Whether you were a walk-in or a drive-in was an idiotic distinction for them to make. Your money was still green, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of amoebas swimming around in the excrement in that alley. (This is such a lovely thread).</p>
<p>I knew an illegal young Mexican who had been in this country about a year, and when she felt strangely low in energy for a few days, she headed to the Walgreens here to buy some medicine for amoebas, since that&rsquo;s what is customarily done in Mexico I assume. (She was disappointed to learn that a prescription is required here).</p>
<p>Every 6 months in Mexico the schools give the children a medicine that kills amoebas and some other parasites, and the rest of the family is encouraged to take the same medicine at the same time. At least that was what I was told by the family I was more or less living with, on the day they (and I) all took the medicine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the life cycle of amoebas and the various other intestinal parasites common in Mexico, so I don&rsquo;t know to what extent they may propagate in the environment up here.</p>

		<p>When I lived in San Francisco, using the airport ladies&rsquo; room was always an adventure.  It was clear how many of the new arrivals had never seen a toilet before &amp; weren&rsquo;t sure how to use it.</p>
<p>I think that alone has dampened any interest I may have had in traveling beyond Europe or the English-speaking countries.  Seriously, what is there to see in China that&rsquo;s worth squatting over a stinking hole several times a day&hellip;? </p>

<p>You have been in the tourist and business hotels set up specifically for visitors. Leave the tourist and business areas and go to where the Chinese actually live and you will find plenty of maggots.</p>
