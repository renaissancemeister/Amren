<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>With that being said, especially with the way guys are getting stabbed these days, I wouldn&rsquo;t publicly be quoted as saying you don&rsquo;t like a particular race of women.</p>
<p>{snip}<blockquote>With the waitress carrying a full load of dirty dishes, Haynesworth slid his credit card into her bra and fondled her according to court documents. A witness, per the report, said it looked like she submitted to it at first but then grew angry. What&rsquo;s interesting: Haynesworth&rsquo;s credit card was denied for a charge of $800.</p>
<p>Haynesworth denied touching the waitress when he spoke with a security official and said he doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;even like black girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what this is about, she is just upset I have a white girlfriend,&#8221; Haynesworth told police. &#8220;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the last time I dated a black girl. She was trying to get with me.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Wait, his credit card was declined?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the &#8220;black girl is mad I got a white girlfriend&#8221; defense will work in court, but I guess we will see. What we do know is that Haynesworth like having unprotected sex with strippers he just met at the Super Bowl.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hurts to say this but I hope the NFL continues their in-fighting and it goes down in flames. These semi-retarded players have had a &#8220;god-like&#8221; status for too long. In college they have a steady stream of co-eds for sex and to do their homework for them. Once in the NFL they think they are above the law and live by a different set of rules. No one dares says &#8220;no&#8221; to them so they act like spoiled over-sexed children. But that&rsquo;s ok, he will be broke with in 5 years of retirement, but that somehow won&rsquo;t be his fault.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a remark attributed to Jack Johnson, the black heavyweight champion of the early 20th century.  When asked why he always went with white women, he&rsquo;s said to have replied, &#8220;They&rsquo;re the only kind worthwhile.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He was alleged to have done the credit card swiping routine against a black woman, and he just admitted he hated black women.  That should be enough to add the bias element in a tortious sense to her civil suit against him or hate crimes riders to any criminal charges against him.</p>

		<p>Why any White woman would take up with a black man is beyond my comprehension.  It also does not speak well for our people.</p>
<p>I do understand why someone would not like black women. If we could only get them to stop breeding&hellip;..</p>

		<p>All sports that blacks participate in are degraded to the point of being grotesque freak shows.</p>
<p>I would not condescend to watch one second of any of them. </p>
<p>I was a competitive athlete year- round (four sports a year as a kid and young adult), but will never sit on my rear and watch scoundrels with no honor .</p>
<p>I am mad that at the gym, TVs blare in the locker room, as idiot sportscasters (diversity merchants)  scream at the top of their lungs all day long, championing the rapists, sodomists and gang thugs.</p>
<p>I do not watch TV, but it is shoved in my face everywhere.</p>
<p>Cripes, out on the gym floor, there are about TWENTY huge TVs in front of all the ellipticals and treadmills. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotten so you have to work out at home, or go hiking. Much better, for some, but those forms of exercise are not always practicable, so the gym is an evil necessity.<br>
So strange, how even self- care and fitness are now a racially charged, angering propaganda battle, where to participate, you gotta&rsquo; swallow images and talk from people like this guy, and his worshipers (the networks).</p>

<p>Maybe his looks, eh Sam? Hold on, I just saw the photo; this fellow is as ugly as sin. Brilliant mind maybe? I doubt it. Shaggy from Scooby Doo would have more up-stairs than this chap.<br>
It has to be the money he earns; either way his &#8216;white girlfriend&rsquo; needs her head examined. Makes a person wonder which one is the brains of the operation.</p>

<p> Having worked over thirty years in academia, I can verify what you said. At my football mad State Institution, black athletes are worshipped as demi-gods, and many have virtual harems of star-struck, liberal brainwashed white coeds. I&rsquo;ve met very few of these student athletes who are really capable of college level work. In today&rsquo;s dreadful economy too much emphasis is placed on &ldquo;bread and circuses.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>&#8220;White&#8221; girls who go with these black guys are no longer White. What took our parents and ancestors thousands of years to maintain,(our race) these &#8220;women&#8221; have spit in their and our faces. The contempt I feel for these types is beyond description. </p>

<p>Tell me about it.  Along with all of the above, all of my gym&rsquo;s treadmills had TVs in them, too, as if there weren&rsquo;t enough everywhere else.  Notice I said &#8220;had,&#8221; because it&rsquo;s in the process of swapping them out with new treadmills that have both TVs and are web-connected and have web browsers.  On the bright side, at least the moron sports propaganda on all the TVs can be countered by visiting AR or Caste Football or SBPDL, but I have this nasty habit of wanting to exercise while I&rsquo;m at the gym, not read websites.  I don&rsquo;t want to read websites, or watch TV, or tweet, or send text messages, or yap on the phone, when I&rsquo;m working out.  All I want to to is sweat my&hellip;well, you know.  It&rsquo;s almost the only time when my phone is nowhere near me, turned off and in locker.  Like yours, there are TVs in my gym&rsquo;s locker room, and I&rsquo;m surprised that nobody has gotten the bright idea to put a water-shielded TV in the showers.  That&rsquo;ll be next.  </p>
<p>Thankfully, it&rsquo;s finally warm around here, and when the it&rsquo;s not too warm or hot, I avoid the gym and work out outdoors.  Out of spite, I ordered some barbells online when I found out my gym was installing those web browser treadmills   &mdash;   The ones I ordered have no TV, no room for a flash drive for your MP3 files, nowhere to plug in your headphones.  Just simple molded cast iron, technology we&rsquo;ve been using for more than 3,000-plus years.  All you do is lift them regularly, and you get stronger.</p>

		<p>There once was a time when having a woman on your arm was a kind of insurance against this presumptive rakishness because no honorable man would dare do this in public with his lady present.</p>
<p>Whatever his private impulses.</p>
<p>I look at the arm of that athlete however and I see that it&rsquo;s as broad across as his skull.  Leading me to wonder how much his thought processes are degraded by steroids.</p>

I don&rsquo;t go to gyms so I didn&rsquo;t know about the tv problem, that is the sickets thing I heard. The sites like this one are likely to be blocked like at my local public library. I am glad I live in a predominantly White area, but the Hispanics have been appearing lately. Swimming is the best exercise, and combined with martial arts and firearm practice, we will survive the black &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; violent riots.<br>
I notice that many &#8220;liberals&#8221; just keep quiet about race and get to live in all wgite areas. Segregation is the solution but what if we moved around so that no black had another for a neighbor, they don&rsquo;t expect us to invade and &#8220;diversify&#8221; the ghetto, thus driving up property value evertwhere.<br>
Oops! My German Short-haired pointer ate my black neighbor!</p>

<p>Yes, swimming is great exercise.  I&rsquo;ll say that, then my gym will get the bright idea to install water-proof TVs in the pool, along the underwater walls on all sides.  It&rsquo;ll give a whole new meaning to television so compelling that you hold your breath.</p>

		<p>Buy a treadmill. Time flies by, and you get a great work-out for your body AND brain if you read a good book at the same time. </p>
