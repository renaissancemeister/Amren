<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42787476/ns/politics/">Is Conservative Student Group Preaching White Nationalism?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Johnson, MSNBC, May 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Youth for Western Civilization, which has chapters at only about 10 U.S. campuses, is just one of hundreds of conservative student organizations around the nation, far smaller than better-known college-based groups like Young Americans for Freedom and College Republicans.</p>
<p>But its influence is bigger than its size, drawing the attention of large numbers of admirers  &mdash;  and critics  &mdash;  since it began organizing three years ago. Thanks to its discipline in advocating a small number of simply stated positions and a new-media-savvy communications strategy, YWC may be radically refreshing the template for political organizing in American higher education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Preserving the &#8216;high culture of Europe&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>YWC&rsquo;s president, Kevin DeAnna, 28, a graduate student in political science at American University in Washington, vigorously denies that his organization is discriminatory in any way. He said characterizations of the groups at the Cologne rally as &#8220;suspected of extremist activities&#8221; had &#8220;a faint Orwellian ring that makes me fear the German government far more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad we have some contacts with European groups,&#8221; he said in an email interview. &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One of the absolutely critical things that separates us from any other conservative groups is that we consider what happens in Europe (and other Western nations such as Canada and Australia) to be just as important as what happens in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[YWC] has honed a strategy of provoking debate over three carefully cultivated but politically potent issues: illegal immigration, multiculturalism and preservation of America&rsquo;s European cultural heritage.</p>
<p>In doing so, it has provoked sometimes-heated debate:</p>
<p>The group first came to widespread attention two years ago, when it tried to host a speech at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill by former Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., who ran for president in 2008 on a platform that advocated overhauling U.S. immigration policy. Protesters, some of them shouting that Tancredo was a racist, blocked the speech; during the protest, a window was shattered and police used pepper spray to restore order.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Events like those  &mdash;  and the group&rsquo;s first national conference, scheduled next month in Washington  &mdash;  are designed to attract attention to YWC&rsquo;s defense of &#8220;Western culture,&#8221; which it defines as &#8220;the social norms, values, practices, and high culture of Europe and those places settled predominantly by the peoples from that area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberal groups like the SPLC contend that language like that is white nationalist code  &mdash;  rhetoric calibrated to sound non-controversial to potential mainstream conservative donors while sending a message of solidarity to right-wing extremists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Contrary to some media reports  &mdash;  and there have been many, because the group is very good at attracting media attention  &mdash;  the SPLC has not listed YWC in its compendium of &#8220;hate groups.&#8221; But Beirich said her organization does consider YWC to be &#8220;the most far-right college group&#8221; in America, &#8220;much more to the right than any other college conservative organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While acknowledging that YWC &#8220;focuses on the issues of racial preferences (and) extreme multiculturalism,&#8221; he rejected the idea that the group is racist. The group&rsquo;s website says students who share its beliefs are welcome to join without regard to race, religion or national origin. While some authors on the site complain about &#8220;privileges&#8221; afforded to illegal and even legal immigrants, others take pains to say they support equal rights for legal immigrants &#8220;who play by the rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeAnna also denies that he once wrote hard-right articles for a website published by the Michigan State University chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, which the SPLC listed as a hate group at the time.</p>
<p>The alleged articles are not on the Web, and while several groups critical of YWC have published what they say are copies from since-deleted archives, msnbc.com could not independently verify that they were authentic.</p>

<p>Only about 10 chapters. MSNBC and the MSM want to keep it that way by demeaning and condescending reporting. </p>
<p>The reference to the &#8216;German government&rsquo; was a nice touch. Get in the Hitler and Nazi association without saying either.<br>

		<p>And just what is wrong with White Nationalism?  Showing solidarity for one&rsquo;s race.  Isn&rsquo;t that what La Raza and others are all about?  So why is it that it&rsquo;s ok for them and not for me?  A conservative, christian, white, American male?  What about the NAACP???  My God they complain at the drop of a hat that things aren&rsquo;t totally in favor of everything black.  And then there is the SPLC.  Them calling someone a hate group is sort of like the pot calling the kettle black, you know?  But nobody holds their feet to the fire.  I am getting very tired of this one way street.  You can&rsquo;t stand up for your heritage if you are white but you can for every other race in America.   Asian-American,  Asian-Pacific American,  American Indian, Mexican-American,  African-American, etc.  etc.   blah blah blah.   What ever happened to just being AMERICAN????   My ancestors came here and were dang glad to be here.  They assimilated and loved (LOVED) being American.  Swelled with pride to see the American Flag in a parade down the street.  Now we have a generation that yanks down the American flag at their high school and runs up the mexican flag and it hardly makes the news.  That just infuriates me.  Anybody else????    It&rsquo;s long (LONG) past time that we white folks had an organization that promoted white values.  If every other race can have it and scream about &#8220;fair&#8221; then it&rsquo;s only fair for me too.</p>

		<p>I enjoy the Youth for Western Civilization website. They do very good work for the preservation of Western civilization. Kevin DeAnna and the other authors articulate their views very well. They deserve to be supported.</p>
<p>Notice that when YWC talks on behalf of white people the media assume that it is always white nationalist code. However, when black or hispanic &#8220;leaders&#8221; talk on behalf of their people, the media never assume that they are talking in black or hispanic nationalist code.</p>
<p>No person aware of the truth regarding racial issues should pay any attention to the SPLC.</p>

		<p>White students are becoming increasingly suspicious and outspoken about Diversity.  Thankfully, but a little late. But as time moves forward, more and more of our White youth will begin to realize that Diversity does nothing for them, except make them legitimate targets of racial discrimination. </p>
<p>Whites who suffer from anti-white hatred are less likely to &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges&#8221;.</p>
<p>More and more college students are seeing Diversity as an expensive burden, the cost of which falls all on us.</p>
<p>Transcend Diversity, Embrace Whiteness, Beware and Prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip; you see it in your nightmares, and you&rsquo;re right&hellip;<br>

		<p> A surprisingly even-handed exploration of the YWC, coming from a liberal-leaning media outlet like MSNBC. For once, leftist spokesmen were not automatically used to rebut everything conservative or race realist people said concerning their movement.</p>
<p> I do find it troubling, though, how the mainstream news media continue to quote the SPLC&rsquo;s attacks on conservative groups, and its labeling of them as &#8220;hate groups&#8221; and other non-sensical terms, as if the SPLC was spouting holy writ. Who, pray tell, ever appointed the SPLC as the final arbiter of whether a group and its beliefs are &#8220;acceptable&#8221; or &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221;? Of course, the answer is, &#8220;No one.&#8221; But so many MSM journalists share the SPLC&rsquo;s general world view, that perhaps they don&rsquo;t even realize how they&rsquo;re &#8220;taking sides&#8221; instead of doing a &#8220;fair and impartial&#8221; job of reporting.</p>
<p> I must say, however, that Alex Johnson is a refreshing change from that rule of thumb. A good report on an organization that we all hope continues to grow in influence.</p>

		<p>What matters is that Youth for Western Civilization find ways of being mentioned by the news media, and that it keep its image clean. <br>
 <br>
A mass movement will attract a certain number of neurotics and fanatics. It is the responsibility of the leadership of the movement to use what these people have to offer - which is a limitless capacity for self sacrifice - without allowing them to shape the public image of the movement. </p>

		<p>La Raza is Hispanic supremacy, not just nationalism. They are mainstream in US politics. Does MSNBC care?</p>
<p>There is a Black National Caucus. Why can&rsquo;t Whites have one? Does MSNBC care?</p>
<p>The ADL is uncritically accepted as the sole arbiter of what is &#8220;extreme&#8221;, &#8220;hateful&#8221;, and &#8220;acceptable&#8221; in US culture. They are plainly a Jewish organization that advocates for Jewish interests. Is MSNBC at all interested in this massive double standard?</p>
<p><br>
No, of course not. See, when Whites self-advocate, that&rsquo;s racism. When non-Whites self-advocate, we must all support it and use it to guide our lives. What do you mean, &#8220;that&rsquo;s not fair&#8221;? What are you, a White supremacist?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s over if this is what they advocate. NEVER allow the enemy inside the tent. In other words they seem to think any nonwhite or of a different religion is &#8220;going to share the same beliefs&#8221; then they are living on Fantasy Island. They don&rsquo;t want to appear &#8220;racist&#8221; so they lose before they even begin. Much like what the BNP did.</p>

		<p>There is nothing wrong with White nationalism.  What is wrong is the very existence of MSNBC.</p>
<p>Ever watched the &#8220;ED SHOW&#8221;?  100 Democratic party press releases.<br>
Even after Bin Laden was killed MSNBC hardly praised Pres Obama, mostly they just nattered on that the Republicans said the wrong things about the capture and execution.</p>
<p>I watched the news shows for a few days after Bin Laden was executed.  That&rsquo;s enough for the next decade.  </p>
<p>By the way, between 3 minutes of news show and 3 minutes of advertizing and the 3 minutes of news constantly interrupted by &#8220;what&rsquo;s up next&#8221; it is almost impossible to understand what they are talking, actually screeching about.</p>

		<p>Interesting this group gets so much negative publicity and is so &#8216;controversial&rsquo;. The group isn&rsquo;t even pro-white or a white interest group on campus. Could there be a hunger for such a group on campus? Considering so many of these groups are active for every other race, a white student group on campus is the only way to bring diversity there. For all we know, as much as I like this group, Youth for Western Civilization may be a consolation prize or a way to delay the formation of white student groups on campus. The longer it takes to bring white student groups to the diversity table, the longer the period of time we can claim we were &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; and &#8216;excluded&rsquo;, cause we certainly know we&rsquo;re officially discriminated against. </p>

		<p>He points out something that I&rsquo;ve been noticing. He says YWC considers what happens in Europe to be just as important as what happens in America. I&rsquo;ve noticed in Canada that the news media report on events in Europe just like it reports on events in Asia, Africa, or South America. These are all equally foreign countries. News media are working against any sense of a common bond between white countries as in western civilization or Christendom.</p>

		<p>The point made above about the offensiveness of having the SPLC set up as some kind of arbiter about what is and isn&rsquo;t acceptable is key. A central effort of any and all genuine-right organizations should be to discredit the SPLC and to expose its own fanatical extremism.</p>

<p>This line from Ms. Beirich should be used as a recruiting tool by YWC. If the SPLC considers them to be the &#8220;most far right student organization in the country&#8221; than they must be doing something right. </p>

		<p>I want to expand on what #9 said. It is absolutely counterproductive to attach the sycophantic statement &#8220;but I support legal immigration!&#8221; when declaring that one is opposed to illegal immigration. Of course illegal immigration must be stopped completely, but LEGAL immigration from the third world is every bit if not more pernicious. And I do not understand for a moment why people don&rsquo;t feel equipped to make an argument for a halt to legal immigration also. There are millions of American citizens without jobs and governments at all levels are under severe financial pressure. It&rsquo;s quite simple. And if anyone refers to that asinine poem on the Statue of Liberty, merely point out how different conditions are compared to the early part of the last century when there was a need for unskilled labor. There is nothing more frustrating than watching someone correctly denounce illegal immigration and then spend more time explaining that part of the reason why he opposes the illegal variety is because it&rsquo;s unfair to the hordes of legal third worlders who are nobly and patiently waiting in line to come here. If that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you oppose illegal immigration, then you&rsquo;re at least nearly and possibly completely clueless. </p>

		<p>So if a black man and myself were to arrive in the USA as legal immigrants, there would be available to him forms of representation and assistance - a Black National Caucus, for e.g. - that are not permitted for me on account of my skin colour? And that any similar organisation for White people - a White National Caucus - would actually be illegal and could see me prosecuted and punished/deported?</p>
<p>That would make me a second class citizen, and this would be anti-White Apartheid, would it not? </p>
<p>Does the Black National Caucus ever hire buses to it&rsquo;s meetings? Are Whites not permitted on said buses, except perhaps in a servile role as drivers? Perhaps this is why the South Africans wanted to stay separate?</p>

I doubt many non whites will join the Youth for Western Civilization. I am confident that any who do will not impede the purposes of the organization. Instead, they would provide cover. An official policy of excluding non whites would unnecessarily make Youth for Western Civilization politically vulnerable. </p>

The ADL is uncritically accepted as the sole arbiter of what is &ldquo;extreme&rdquo;, &ldquo;hateful&rdquo;, and &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; in US culture. They are plainly a Jewish organization that advocates for Jewish interests. Is MSNBC at all interested in this massive double standard?<br>
_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The ADL  advocates for all &#8220;minority&#8221; groups. It is only Whites that they see as a danger and a threat.  The SPLC is another one of their groups that targets Whites/heteros and Christians only. </p>
<p>Also as another poster pointed out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The group&rsquo;s website says students who share its beliefs are welcome to join without regard to race, religion or national origin. While some authors on the site complain about &ldquo;privileges&rdquo; afforded to illegal and even legal immigrants, others take pains to say they support equal rights for legal immigrants &ldquo;who play by the rules.&rdquo;<br>
______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>This will be the downfall of the YWC, just as it will be for the Tea Party. They are ripe for the infiltrators and those they want support from now will doom their cause.</p>
<p>WHY is it that EVERY TIME a White group comes along they ALWAYS are of the mindset of the &#8220;all inclusive&#8221; big tent that will destroy them from the get go? Look at what it has done to the GOP.  They can never go back now from that claim. Don&rsquo;t they know that those they want in their movement will hijack it and still call them &#8220;racist&#8221;? </p>
<p>PLEASE, just have a movement for like minded WHITES only and quit apologizing for it, by allowing the enemy inside of that movement to get their claws sharpened on our backs. </p>
<p>The YWC needs to read Amren among other White racialist sites to see what needs to be done.</p>

		<p>Why is it, blacks can have virtually anything they want? Whether it be their own TV channels, colleges, &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;, etc, Hispanics can have their own secessionist genocidal La Raza (which calls for the mass slaughter of Europeans) yet when whites so much as hint that we are even a legitimate ethnic group, people lose their marbles!<br>
I am hesitant about YWC. They are very Republican (which, in my opinion is not a good idea, since both parties are working against white interests) and as another poster has said, the YWC &ldquo;will welcome anyone who shares same beliefs regardless of race&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what whites have been saying for decades and now look! Chaos.<br>
If we want to form functional and productive pro-white groups, they have to be just that, white and only white. Our circumstances are too dire for anything else.</p>
<p><br>
I used to watch MSNBC all the time, and I can tell you it&rsquo;s mostly just people sitting there and agreeing with each other. Keith Olbermann is the worst, he never has anyone that actually disagrees with him, and rather he sits there and agrees with HIMSELF for an hour! After the Arizona Immigration debate, I stopped watching MSNBC. </p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not a fan of Fox News or CNN either.</p>

<p>Hey Morris, is that kind of like the &#8220;code&#8221; used in the 60&rsquo;s by liberals? We all knew the law meant nothing but a quota based system and more race based discrimination but it was called &#8220;Civil Rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for your &#8221; power in numbers&#8221; statement, that is like saying since blacks and hispanics are a growing demograhic in White America, that gives Whites &#8220;power in numbers&#8221; if we include them into our nation to destroy our EUROPEAN heritage and culture? Like they are doing now.</p>
<p>   <br>
And YES, WESTERN (White) civilization is comprised of ONLY those of a European HERITAGE and civilization! What does the word heritage even mean to you? What does a WESTERN civilization mean to you? It means those of the White race, otherwise it would not be a &#8220;heritage&#8221; or a Western civilization.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And if anyone refers to that asinine poem on the Statue of Liberty, merely point out how different conditions are compared to the early part of the last century when there was a need for unskilled labor&#8221;</p>
<p>You might also point out that her Father, Moses Lazarus was one of the largest slave owners in Louisiana.  They lived mostly in NYC but owned sugar plantations in Louisiana.  Before the civil war the state of Louisiana had some sort of labor regulations that protected slaves as well as free workers.</p>
<p>After the civil war the regulations continued.  Also after the civil war a federally directed black group monitored conditions of black laborers.  This was mostly an attempt to prevent the employers from bringing back slavery in the form of life long apprentice contracts.  But it also functioned as a labor relations board.</p>
<p>Moses Lazarus was often mentioned as one of the most abusive slave owners and after the war employers of black labor in the state.</p>
<p>Might also ask just why one of the richest sugar plantation owners in the country would advocate for the immigration of more and more of what Karl Marx very rightly called surplus labor.</p>

		<p>What we are seeing wordwide is the implementation of cultural Marxism. </p>
<p>Marxism&rsquo;s use is as an instrument of warfare and its objective is to subvert the enemy without going to war.</p>
<p>Classical Marxism or economic Marxism failed to spread to the West, as the white middle class proved to difficult to mobilize.</p>
<p>You cannot have a revolution without revolutionaries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Franfurt school of Marxism&#8221; (watch the Youtube videos please) thus created NEO Marxism or cultural Marxism, which states that all cultures are equal. The beauty of this was that revolutionaries could now be sourced from other cultures. This is why aid is given to African countries, as it enables them to breed. This is why black Africans are encouraged to immigrate to the US and Europe and why white Africans find it impossible to do the same, without having to go through a very lengthy, technical and costly procedure.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxism&rsquo;s main weapon is political correctness. As all cultures are equal extra care must be taken not to offend anyone.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxism masquerades today as liberalism.</p>
<p>Never forget that Marxism is an instrument of war. </p>
<p>Watch the Youtube videos of Yuri Bezmenov an KGB defector and educate yourself. The white world is in peril and is slow in waking up to this fact, because this fact is not politcally correct.</p>
<p>The MSM is the mouthpiece of the cultural Marixists.</p>
