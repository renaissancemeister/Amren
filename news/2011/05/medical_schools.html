<h1>Medical Schools&rsquo; Race Bar</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Retha Grobbelaar, Times Live (Johannesburg), May 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 18-year-old, who matriculated at Pretoria&rsquo;s Afrikaanse HoÃ«r Meisieskool, is still determined to become a doctor, despite her applications being rejected by the universities of Pretoria, Stellenbosch and the Free State.</p>
<p>Lubbe is one of many white matriculants who battle to gain acceptance to medical schools, where race still plays a large role.</p>
<p>Now, Lubbe and others like her are studying towards other degrees to try to increase their chances of acceptance by medical schools later during their studies.</p>
<p>Louise van Immerzeel, 24, a third-year medical student at Wits University, completed a BSc degree before being accepted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t explain how hard it is to get in. I have lots of people in my class with a master&rsquo;s degree. There are people with PhDs that didn&rsquo;t get in,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Medical school admission policies extend from a strict, race-based system in use by the University of Cape Town (UCT) to a &#8220;definite effort. to accommodate candidates from a disadvantaged academic background&#8221; at Free State University.</p>
<p>UCT is clear about its racial selection criteria, by which black students need to obtain 534 out of 900 points, whereas white and Indian candidates have to achieve 700 out of 900 marks to make their &#8220;admission probable&#8221;.</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s website also says that coloured pupils have to score 578 points and Chinese 660.</p>
<p>UCT vice-chancellor Max Price said one of the reasons for the rigid policy was the education system, which is &#8220;a mess&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The unfairness happens in schools and not in universities. These black students overcome enormous odds.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t have the internet and parents helping them with homework, and they have very poor teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all that, to get 60% you have to be close to a genius and highly motivated,&#8221; said Price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most white students who get 80% in matric have been to private schools or attended formerly model C schools and have educated parents who can help them with their homework. They have all those advantages that enable them to do well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Price, who admitted that he was generalising, added: &#8220;The playing field is not level. To look only at marks would be unfair to disadvantaged students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Price said the only equitable way of selection was to evaluate disadvantaged students against each other and not against those of other races. He said it did not matter whether the prospective black students came from a private school because their parents were not as well educated as those of their white counterparts.</p>
<p>Price said his university was &#8220;researching&#8221; other ways of selecting students that did not rely largely on race.</p>
<p>But at Walter Sisulu University&rsquo;s medical school, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, officials are battling to find enough white students.</p>
<p>The admission policy stipulates that of the first-year intake, 75% of students, has to be black, 15% Indian, 5% Coloured or white, and 5% from Lesotho.</p>
<p>The executive dean of the faculty of health sciences, Professor Khaya Mfenyana said: &#8220;We are struggling to get whites and coloureds and this is why we only have 5% for them. On the other hand we have too many Indians applying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lubbe said being rejected, even after scoring seven distinctions, was difficult. She is now studying for a BSc degree in biological sciences and has applied for a place at a medical school at the end of the first semester.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really hope I get in. If I get in, it&rsquo;s a dream. If I don&rsquo;t make it, I&rsquo;ll try again,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>Not much different from the US.  50 percent of med students must be female and 35 percent non White male.  That leaves only 15 percent White male.</p>
<p>The med schools will always pick a &#8216;diversity White&#8221;, Arab, Pakistani, Iranian etc over an American White male.  The female 50 percent is like government jobs, mostly minority.</p>
<p>Not much difference.</p>

<p>If Dr. Price feels so strongly about this, then wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have a separate medical school for the black students?  That way, during medical school they would not be competing against Asian or white students.</p>
<p>If you want an integrated med school, Dr. Price, then you should do it solely based on the marks, not racial quotas.  When Dr. Price needs medical care for his own family, I wonder if he chooses to visit a white or a black doctor.</p>

When I go to a doctor I want someone who had all the advantages because I want someone who knows what he is doing. <br>

<p>We can therefore expect blacks to outperform whites in all areas, since most blacks who become physicians under this program are geniuses.</p>
<p><br>
I also recommend that Mr/Mrs Price be treated only by black physicians, since they have overcome so much more than their undeserving, inferior white colleagues.</p>

		<p>They have it backwards. Black students should need better grades than White students simply because it is so much easier to get an &#8216;A&rsquo; at some ghetto school were the curriculum is dumbed down and the teachers bend over backwards to pass the students.  The White kids will have a much tougher time maintaining a &lsquo;4.0&rsquo; GPA at some elite private school.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s fairly tough for whites to emigrate from SA. This could be a ticket out, if done right. If a young white can get into a medical school abroad, once graduated he need never come back.</p>

		<p>This is insane. I&rsquo;ve yet to find a country that doesn&rsquo;t have a shortage of good doctors and this will only make things worse. If someone is capable of becoming a doctor they should be encouraged to become one.</p>

I trust these students are strongly advised that showering following sex with someone with AIDS is not a recognised preventative measure or, indeed, a cure, notwithstanding what the President of RSA says and does. &ldquo;After all that, to get 60% you have to be close to a genius and highly motivated,&rdquo; Or be president of the country.</p>

<p>And this is for a medical school? To train doctors, I presume? What happens when these substandard students start practicing medicine? It&rsquo;s one thing to hand out university AA admissions in soft degrees like black studies, but here we are talking about putting people&rsquo;s lives at risk. Not to mention the broader issue of public health. How do they plan to deal with epidemics?  And do they think this kind of admission policy is going to produce another Dr Christiaan Barnard?</p>
<p>Then again, this is what is to be expected in SA when Whites surrendered power. At best, Whites end up as second class citizens, assuming they do not get ethnically cleansed ala Zimbabwe. As usual, this point is lost on Western liberals. They have a delusion that the end of White rule means some kind of egalitarian paradise. But the reality is that it means the replacement of a White racial elite with a black racial elite. The difference is that Whites produce functional societies, while we can see the difference between, say, a Rhodesia under Smith and a Zimbabwe under Mugabe.</p>
<p>All I can say is this: if you get sick these days, make sure it is not in the rainbow nation of South Africa. </p>

		<p>I have worked in the same hospital for 9 years and I can tell you, blacks Do Not want to be seen by black doctors and they will tell you so. They say black doctors are not as good. Now they can say this but if they were white they would be called Racist.</p>

		<p>The average IQ of a South African black is around 72.</p>
<p>That means that only about 1% of South African blacks have IQs as high as the white average.</p>
<p>In other words, only a handful - if that â of South African blacks would qualify for medical school in Germany or France or the United States or Canada.</p>
<p>So-called black South African doctors are essentially glorified nurses aides - but unfortunately, without nurses or doctors to supervise them.</p>

Price, who admitted that he was generalising, added: &ldquo;The playing field is not level. To look only at marks would be unfair to disadvantaged students.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&#8216;Generalizing&rsquo; in the U.S. is called _racism_.</p>
<p>Whites will not hold high standards of ability to &#8216;unfairly&rsquo; teach their children to USE their 100+ IQs if they don&rsquo;t continue to get the kinds of jobs that give them the experience, mindset and wisdom to mentor.</p>
<p>This is why, constitution or no (Blacks are terrified of whites &#8216;moving out&rsquo; and leaving them a third world nation to be mocked for their genetic _stupidity_), the only way forwards is for whites to move out of South Africa to either a separate state of their own.</p>
<p>Or to other African nations where their superiority as society makers is acknowledged.  And rewarded.</p>
<p>All this proves is that Racism is Right because Racism _works_.  Which is why blacks have adopted it as their own repressive tool.</p>
<p>Blacks however -don&rsquo;t- work and so cannot sustain the society they have inherited.</p>
<p>As an example of how readily the alternative could play out, let me mention Messrs. Gerhard Wisser and Johan Meyer of Tradefin Inc.  Even 10+ years after the disaster of 1994, when the Libyans needed a nuclear pumping system to cycle UHF gas through centrifuges, they came to South Africa to make it work.  In less than 6 months, Mr. Meyer had 200 tons and 2 stories tall worth of complex plumbing up and ready for test runs.</p>
<p>If that kind of expertise exists, even in 2001-02, then South Africa or a Boer Independent State could become a nuclear power in _no time_.  Sufficient force will teach blacks to keep their fingers off white goodness while they squat in their growing squallor.</p>
