			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Turenne, Ottawa Sun, April 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Winnipeg man on trial for rape claims he was forced to have anal sex with his alleged victim against his will, accusing her of stealing his sperm so she could have a mixed-race baby.</p>
<p>When asked by the Crown whether he thought pregnancy could result from anal sex, the man replied: &#8220;I&rsquo;m not in the medical profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trial of Hilaire Ndyat, 42, wrapped up in Winnipeg Friday, with Justice Gerald Chartier reserving judgment on whether he will find the man guilty of one count of sex assault. His decision is expected next month.</p>
<p>Ndyat, a native of the Democratic Republic of Congo who moved to Winnipeg in 1996, is executive director of the Winnipeg Afro-Aboriginal Crosscultural Association and is also involved with numerous inner-city and cultural organizations and committees.</p>
<p>Ndyat is accused of raping a female acquaintance inside his West Broadway apartment in March 2008, with the Crown suggesting he may have drugged the woman&rsquo;s beer before raping her.</p>
<p>However, while testifying in French at his trial Tuesday, Ndyat claimed it was the woman who forced herself on him and that he didn&rsquo;t resist because women are revered in his culture and he didn&rsquo;t know how to react to her advances.</p>
<p>Ndyat testified that he only resisted when the woman removed his condom and tried to force anal penetration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found that disgusting. I pushed her away and ran to the bathroom to wash up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In my culture, anal sex is taboo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ndyat said he became concerned when he later discovered his used condom was missing and remembered the woman had told him of her fondness for mixed-race children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she wanted a black man&rsquo;s sperm as she mentioned earlier during the conversation that she&rsquo;d like to have a mixed child, (she was) using me as a sperm donor by stealing sperm from me,&#8221; he wrote in a 2008 statement to police and his employer.</p>
<p>When asked on the stand whether he knew that anal sex doesn&rsquo;t lead to pregnancy, Ndyat said he is not a doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;His version of the events insults our intelligence and defies common sense,&#8221; prosecutor Lisa Cupples told court during Friday&rsquo;s closing arguments. &#8220;His testimony makes no sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ndyat&rsquo;s counsel argued the woman&rsquo;s story is not credible and suggested Ndyat be acquitted.</p>

<p>People in the Congo don&rsquo;t just &#8220;move to Winnipeg&#8221; on a whim.  The tone of this sentence makes it sound like a natural exchange between equals.</p>
<p>In fact, the Canadian government warns against Canadians setting foot in the DRC. </p>
<p>Quote: &#8220;Humanitarian workers and UN personnel have been the object of armed and sometimes violent attacks, robbery, extortion and aggravated assault including sexual assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>If nothing else, the Congolese are experts at sexual assault, with sexual violence being described as &#8220;the worst in the world&#8221; due to &#8220;a generally callous attitude towards the female sex as well as the normalization of rape in the DRC.&#8221; <br>

		<p>The Black guy is lying. Anal sex taboo to Black men? I had a blond Polish friend who was dating a Filipina who only dated White men (like so many Asian women) and who was way out of his league in terms of money and she insisted on barebacking claiming she was on the pill. She dumped him after she got pregnant knowing he&rsquo;d want nothing to do with the miscegenated baby. Get it? It happens.</p>

		<p>Now I&rsquo;ve heard it all. Either the defendant is a total idiot, or he thinks HM Government is (and who knows, he may be right on that count).</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Honour, my fist was just minding its own business when her nose smashed into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is too goofy even for the former British Empire. If they acquit him, it will be obvious that the sun truly has set forever.</p>

		<p>Since she was going to have sexual relations with him anyway, why go to all the trouble of stealing sperm and all? Why not just have regular, unprotected sex and let nature take its course? As for Mr. Nydat, it defies belief that a 42-year-old man doesn&rsquo;t know the very basics of sex education. His story/excuse doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Even Africans from the Republic of Congo know better than that.</p>

		<p>Does anybody believe this stuff?</p>
<p>First &hellip; does anybody believe a woman would really want a mixed race child?</p>
<p>Hilaire Ndyat</p>
<p>Second &hellip;. How is this pertinent: <i> exec director of Winnipeg Afro-Aboriginal Crosscultural Association and is also involved with numerous inner-city and cultural organizations and committees.</i></p>
<p>Third: Rape is a regular thing for African men, women who don&rsquo;t get raped &hellip;. . <i> Ndyat claimed it was the woman who forced herself on him and that he didn&rsquo;t resist because women are revered in his culture and he didn&rsquo;t know how to react to her advances.</i></p>
<p>Forth, it might be taboo but when a Black is in the raping mode a Black will hit any hole &hellip;.: <i>Ndyat testified that he only resisted when the woman removed his condom and tried to force anal penetration. .. <br>
&ldquo;I found that disgusting. I pushed her away and ran to the bathroom to wash up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my culture, anal sex is taboo.&rdquo;</i></p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a real shame that Hilaire Ndyat is up in Canada, because he would be the perfect room mate for that black farm hand down in Alabama who got video taped helping himself to his employer&rsquo;s female hogs, who wound up catching an STD.</p>
<p>Is there anyway we can start up a special fund drive, and petition the Canadian government to extradite Ndyat to Alabama?</p>

You&rsquo;re being too conservative in your observation. Congolese, Zimbabwean, S. African, Tanzanian, Somali,Jamaican, Comptonese, South Side Chicagoan, North or West Philadlephian, Harlemite, Bedford Stuyvesantese, Over the Rhinese  etcetera- they&rsquo;re all experts at sexual assault.</p>

		<p>Disgraceful.  Rape is a normal activity for African men, and black American men rape at a much higher percentage than whites.  Why do we find ourselves in this situation?  Because white guilt has been the mindset for 50 years and more.  Too long.  It is time for white people to wake up and take back their country.  If hard times come in the event of an economic collapse, we will see craziness that rivals Katrina. If there is no food in the supermarkets people will begin to move into more affluent areas, white areas, and probably butcher them before moving into their homes.  Paranoia?  Craziness?  I dunno. People should make sure they have a plan.</p>

		<p>Black women have been doing this for decades.  They want light skinned kids and get pregnant from a non-blacks to accomplish that.  I saw a TV show concerning this.  The black women also want kids with &#8220;good hair&#8221; meaning not kinky African hair.  Lighter skin and good hair seem to be the order of the day.  </p>
<p>Oprah mentioned on her show the fact that her black grandmother preferred her lighter cousins over Oprah&rsquo;s darker skin.  </p>
<p>And then there is Michael Jackson&hellip;.I won&rsquo;t even bother with his skin bleaching or &#8220;his kids&#8221; who certainly are not his.    <br>

		<p>Hilaire said &#8221; &ldquo;In my culture, anal sex is taboo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is totally false in muslim countries. Women indulge in anal sex as a birth control program which also maintains their virginity for when their families sell them since no muslim man wants a non virgin woman. Muslim girls use oral and anal sex for their own gratification and that of their lovers/boyfriends/brothers/uncles/cousins (sometimes all in one) but this is true nontheless.</p>

		<p>Here is an article on Mr. Ndyat and all the wonderful things he&rsquo;s done for Canada. One must read between the lines to get the jist of what a parasite he&rsquo;s been, &#8220;expanding his education, etc&#8221; all on public expense, with no mention of him ever having any sort of job.</p>

<p>I did not ask for ANY non-White to be imported into the US, did you?  Do you know ANY white American who desires that his homeland be overtaken by refugees and destitute immigrants?</p>
<p>Your &#8220;we&#8221; does not include ME or the vast majority of the American people, so Can It!  A tiny minority that has a stranglehold on the US Government imported and continues to import nonwhites to dilute the white population.

		<p>If the woman is pregnant, abort/adopt out the child and give her the residuals of the court case/confinement, saved by not going the full route with a sentencing.  Make the man allocute to what really happened and give him time served plus probation with a 1,000hrs of charity and a permanent registry on the sex offender list.</p>
<p>If she doesn&rsquo;t want to get rid of the child, find the man innocent and close the case.</p>
<p>Women do crazy things when they are of a mind to have a child by whomever and I have little compassion for white women in a black man&rsquo;s apartments, whether they accept a DRD spiked drink or not.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to have 100-200,000 dollar court cases over idiot moves like this.</p>

<p>Everyone here is far too solicitous of the white &#8220;victim&#8221; here, who had no business in the black man&rsquo;s apartment. What did she think was going to happen?</p>
<p>These foolish, miscegenating white women should be held morally accountable for their actions, not treated as helpless children who have fallen prey to the big, bad, black wolf.</p>
