<h1>Hispanic GOP Group Urges Porsche to Build HQ Outside Georgia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Redmon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Hispanic Republican group opposed to Georgia&rsquo;s new immigration enforcement law is asking Porsche to reconsider building its new North American headquarters in the state.</p>
<p>Somos Republicans  &mdash;  an Arizona-based organization aimed at increasing the number of Latinos voting for Republican candidates  &mdash;  made the request in an open letter it issued Friday concerning Georgia&rsquo;s House Bill 87.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge Porsche to reconsider your choice of Georgia as the site of a new headquarters facility, as we don&rsquo;t believe Georgia has provided an accurate picture of Georgia&rsquo;s economy and the regression into a past era where Georgia experienced some of the worst bigotry in modern times.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Porsche spokesman said Monday that his company is proceeding with plans to move its North American headquarters and what could be hundreds of jobs from Sandy Springs to the site of a former Ford plant near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Porsche first announced those plans this month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Nathan Deal signed HB 87 into law this month. Much of it is scheduled to start taking effect July 1. Partly patterned after a law Arizona enacted last year, Georgia&rsquo;s measure punishes people who transport or harbor illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Georgia&rsquo;s law also penalizes people who use fake identification to get a job here. And it authorizes police to investigate the immigration status of suspects they believe have committed state or federal crimes and who cannot produce identification, such as a driver&rsquo;s license, or provide other information that could help police identify them.</p>
<p>Somos Republicans  &mdash;  or &#8220;We are Republicans&#8221;  &mdash;  issued its open letter on the same day other opponents of HB 87 revealed they are divided over how to respond to Georgia&rsquo;s new law.</p>
<p>The Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, the Latin American Chamber of Commerce of Georgia and the Latinos in Information Sciences &amp; Technology Association announced their opposition to economic boycotts Friday, saying they could hurt Hispanics who work in the state&rsquo;s tourism industry. On the other side, organizations that advocate for immigrants  &mdash;  including Cuentame and Southerners on New Ground  &mdash;  have encouraged businesses and conventioneers to cancel their trips to Georgia because of House Bill 87.</p>

		<p>Georgia failed to protect its borders from the invasion of illegal aliens, called &#8220;valuable and enriching migrants,&#8221; so we don&rsquo;t care what suffering Georgians get in consequence.  The situation is so bad for White Humanity, we are forced into the perverse, but very necessary, attitude that worse is better.  Those who embrace diversity should suffer for diversity, i.e. suffer &#8220;from&#8221; diversity.   Let the misery grow!<br>

<p>Set aside all of the open borders Hispanderers&rsquo; political posturing for a moment. No matter how you slice it, Porsche isn&rsquo;t going to be able to reliably and consistantly produce a quality high end car true to its namesake anywhere near Hartsfield International Airport. They might as well try to set up shop in Detroit. You&rsquo;d think that they would locate in a place like Greenville, SC. (BMW did and it seemed to work out well for them in terms of a quality driven, high work ethic labor force)  </p>

		<p>Somos Republicans.  Same deal as the Homo Republicans.  Liberals pretending to be conservatives, but pushing liberal agendas from within.  Call them Fifth Column, Fellow Travelers, snakes in the grass, whatever.  All amounts to the same thing.  Ever notice how many gay churches there are now?  Did you wonder why?  Well, for ten or 20 years they have been infiltrating Christian churches, joining, and then coming out of the closet.  Once their numbers were significant enough (I&rsquo;m guessing five to ten percent) they push their agenda.  Same with the political parties.  Join, grown in numbers, then undermine.  Not such a surprise.  Heck, when they have more than enough votes to win a primary or national election, they send a group to register as voters of the opposing party so they can tilt the primary to a liberal candidate in the opposing party.  There is NOTHING and I mean nothing sleazy, underhanded, radical or lawless the liberals and fags won&rsquo;t do for their cause.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s real rich coming from a race-based organization. You see Latino groups crying racism all the time, yet they are race-based organizations. Do they not see the hypocrisy in their actions? Personally, I think they do and they don&rsquo;t care as long as it works for them.<br>

		<p>My impression is that when the German automakers moved to the USA they generally set up plants well away from the social problems and attitudinal problems that helped ruin US car makers.  They may not have specifically avoided diversity but that was the side effect of their choices.  </p>
<p>Volkswaggon of course has substantial experience opperating in Sth America and Mexico. Exactly how onerous &#8216;racial quota&rsquo; laws are in these countries I am unsure of.  I immagine that in Mexico they employ anyone they wish to while in brazil they have their plant in Curitiba in the Eurpean South which is 76% White and 19% mixed race and only 2.8% black.</p>

<p>But we do. No racially aware (or even sane) person goes to &#8220;365Black&#8221; McDonalds any more. Didn&rsquo;t you get the memo?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t need some &#8220;organizer&#8221; to tell me who to boycott. If I am offended by the doings of a corporation, I just avoid them. </p>
<p>That avenue is open to you as well.</p>

		<p>For all this splendid, desireable diversity that&rsquo;s supposed to bring everyone together harmoniously into one joyous group, I&rsquo;ve never in my life seen so many separate, individual ethinic organizations sprouting up - all of them jumping up and demanding focused attention. Can we say &#8216;not working?&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Hey, white republicans.  Maybe you could pander to the whites who have been voting for you and who have put you in power?  Maybe you could stop pandering to people who hate you and who would never vote for you?  Just a thought.</p>
