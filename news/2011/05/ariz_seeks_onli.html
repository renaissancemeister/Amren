<h1>Ariz. Seeks Online Donations to Build Border Fence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Davenport, Yahoo! News, May 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arizona lawmakers want more fence along the border with Mexico  &mdash;  whether the federal government thinks it&rsquo;s necessary or not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a plan that could get a project started using online donations and prison labor. If they get enough money, all they would have to do is get cooperation from landowners and construction could begin as soon as this year.</p>
<p>Gov. Jan Brewer recently signed a bill that sets the state on a course that begins with launching a website to raise money for the work, said state Sen. Steve Smith, the bill&rsquo;s sponsor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to build this site as fast as we can, and promote it, and market the heck out of it,&#8221; said Smith, a first-term Republican senator from Maricopa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Part of the marketing pitch for donations could include providing certificates declaring that individual contributors &#8220;helped build the Arizona wall,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s going to be a really, really neat thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matthew Chandler said federal officials declined to comment on the Arizona legislation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith and other supporters of the border-fence legislation haven&rsquo;t produced any cost estimates for the state project, saying only that the state should be able to do it far more inexpensively than the federal government.</p>
<p>That still could be put the state&rsquo;s costs in the tens of millions of dollars  &mdash;  or more.</p>
<p>A 2009 report by Congress&rsquo; Government Accountability Office said costs of federal fencing work to keep out people on foot ranged from $400,000 to $15.1 million per mile, while costs for vehicle barriers ranged from $200,000 to $1.8 million. Costs varied by such things as types of fencing geography, land costs and labor expenses, the report said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During committee hearings and floor debates, Republicans said the state has a legal and moral obligation to take action because the federal government hasn&rsquo;t done enough to secure the border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Any type of fence would require approval of landowners, but Smith said he expects that to be forthcoming from the state and private land owners, including ranchers who have complained of break-ins and other trouble associated with smugglers and illegal crossings.</p>

		<p>I disagree. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Nothing will be done in Arizone or anywhere along the border. However, you WILL NEED MONEY to escape when the inevitable collapse of America occurs. Save that money now and begin to use it wisely. Gold? Maybe a little. Better uses are dual citizenship, a rural home or place overseas in an ethnically cohesive area, and trading those dollars in for UK Pounds. True, England is in trouble too. But at least all your eggs aren&rsquo;t in one rotten basket.</p>

		<p>I donated $100 online, and I don&rsquo;t care if the money will actually go toward the building of a fence or not. My donation was sent as my way of telling the feds that when a state asks for protection against invasion. it&rsquo;s the fed&rsquo;s responsibilty to provide it. But of course, Obummer and his illegal-loving cronies would rather abuse their &#8220;power&#8221; in an attempt to bully the State of Arizona into changing its perfectly Constitutional immigration laws. Shame on the federal government; it&rsquo;s neither fit nor worthy to govern a free and democratic people. It needs to be dissolved in favor of a new government that cares and respects the rule of law. God save the Constitution of the United States of America. </p>

D11T &amp; D11T CDThe current D11T was introduced in early 2008 and is also 850 hp (630 kW). This comes as a regular bulldozer and a Carrydozer like the previous model. As with the D11R, the D11T Carrydozer can push 57.9 yards (52.9 m) while the regular D11T can push 45 yards (41 m) of earth. A new D11T was on display at the Caterpillar display at Minexpo during the 22 to 24 September 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br>

<p>100 bulldozers, each digging 20 miles per year, equates to 2,030ft per week or 12ft per hour to go _2,000 miles_.</p>
<p>i.e. the entire border of the United States with Mexico.  </p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s longside is on the north/south axis so their border with Mexico is only 310 miles.</p>
<p>Take _15.5 dozers_ at 20 miles per year/2030ft per week/12ft per hour and you can dig a ditch, twenty feet wide and ten feet deep, filled with mines.</p>
<p>In.  One.  Year.</p>
<p>And the border traffic will stop, instantly.</p>
<p>People have no comprehension as to the scale of earthmoving capabilities inherent to modern engineering.  And the government gets away with lying, blatantly, to us based on our collective ignorance.</p>
<p>So that they can further their race replacement agenda, driving us to extinction in _our homeland_.</p>
