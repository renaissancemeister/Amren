			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i> Daily Mail (London), May 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mayor of New York City has sparked controversy by getting involved in the national immigration debate - declaring that all immigrants should all be sent to Detroit.</p>
<p>Mayor Bloomberg made the contentious comments while appearing on NBC&rsquo;s political talk show Meet the Press.</p>
<p>But while he sounds convinced by the idea, critics in Detroit are not quite so convinced.</p>
<p>&#8216;If I were the federal government,&rsquo; Bloomberg told David Gregory on NBC&rsquo;s Meet the Press Sunday morning, &#8216;assuming you could wave a magic wand and pull everybody together, you pass a law letting immigrants come in as long as they agree to go to Detroit and live there for five or ten years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bloomberg said under his proposals, immigrants would arrive in Detroit and &#8216;start businesses, take jobs, whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;You would populate Detroit over night because half the world wants to come here. You can use something like immigration policy, at no cost to the federal government, to fix a lot of the problems that we have,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>The Mayor&rsquo;s comments come after the 2010 census revealed that Detroit has suffered a devastating population loss in recent decades, losing 25 per cent of its citizens in ten years. Population figures in the city are now at their lowest since 1910.</p>
<p>Significantly, the automotive industry is now struggling in a place which was once known as the &#8216;Motor City&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the country continues to struggle to deal with the number of immigrants wanting to come live in the United States.</p>
<p>While Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s vision would be seen by some to hold some logic, his counterpart in Detroit is yet to be convinced.</p>
<p>&#8216;There are things that would have to be considered before we just open the flood gates and say everyone come in,&rsquo; Karen Dumas, spokeswoman for Detroit Mayor Dave Bing said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Certainly, we do have room for additional citizens. We certainly welcome those citizens but we would want to make sure that people who are here are able to enjoy a quality of life from an educational perspective, an employment perspective and a public safety perspective.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dumas suggested the immigration situation was not quite as simple as Bloomberg had suggested.</p>
<p>Detroit residents might not take too kindly to the sudden influx of thousands of immigrants competing for jobs, she said, and new immigrants would need assistance from the government to help them make the transition to the city.</p>
<p>When pressed on whether Mayor Bloomberg might care to deal with problems in his own city rather than offer pointers elsewhere, Dumas said: &#8216;Detroit is everyone&rsquo;s case study. Everybody has an idea or solution for Detroit but it&rsquo;s a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking and back-seat driving.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Really?  What a great idea.  I mean, the people he is talking about do such a great job of doing that in every country they are from, especially mexico.  Those countries all have shining examples of prosperous cities, just like detroit used to be.  Because, after all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what race they are.  Everyone copies the behavior of the whites who built detroit.</p>
<p>Oh wait a minute&hellip;.no they don&rsquo;t.  All the places these people are from are extreme hell holes.  And the limits of their desire to &#8220;start a business&#8221; is murder for hire, drug dealing and prostituting their sister to the first two.</p>
<p>Of course what Bloomberg really means is that the concentration of feral blacks in detroit is what has caused the extreme decay and he hopes that placing mexicans in the same neighborhood would spark a race war&hellip;.hopefully driving the blacks out of the city.  You know&hellip;.like what happened in LA the last decade or so&hellip;..a well covered event in the national media.  Oh wait a minute.  LA just magically turned from all black to all hispanic.  Nobody knows why.</p>

		<p>&lsquo;Send &rsquo;Em to Detroit&rsquo;: Mayor Bloomberg&rsquo;s Novel Solution to America&rsquo;s Immigration Problem,</p>
<p>This man is living proof you don&rsquo;t have to be smart to make money.  Since money begats money, Bloomberg, like many of his ilk, started off with a windfall amount of finances and did well via the people he hired.  He&rsquo;s a dunce, which is clearly illustrated by the kooky ideas he comes up with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also an embarassment to himself and his family.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Perhaps immigrants might actually start businesses and create jobs? And then gentrify the place? <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Mexican Gentrification&hellip;<br>
https://www.vdare.com/bevens/060209_maywood.htm</p>
<p>You import Mexicans and you bring Mexico.</p>
<p>Service cultures cannot exist as their own raison detre`.</p>
<p>If Mexico&rsquo;s lowest classes were qualified for heavy industrial work and we had a culture that realized, in the coming post-peak petrocrash of USD values, that we _needed_ home industry to offset the loss in purchasing power for Chinese goods (enough to be protectionist), we would be in a different position.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t they are by and large, dirt poor, rural, farm people.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be pretending that the best social engineering intentions can stand in for actual utility to our much diminished nation because &#8216;Motor City&rsquo; is _already gone_.</p>
<p>As is, this is just the elite&rsquo;s last desperate ploy to keep the races &#8216;together but separately&rsquo; in a consumer index way that may also be a means to directly compete black and hispanics in a fight to the death over social entitlements.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t work because Americans have all of California spread before them as an example of what &#8216;Sacramento Politics&rsquo; does to keep a welfare state on the way to bankruptcy under Mexification.  And furthermmore, we know who pays for crashed car companies and big banks.</p>
<p>But that only means that, through the government that they already own, those elites will go over our heads and do it arbitrarily &#8216;by mandate or international treaty&rsquo;, anway.</p>

		<p>Man! If Bloomberg brings in his Mexicans to Detroit, or his Somalis all he&rsquo;ll is going to break loose. The Mexicans and Somalis are going to run the bruthas out of their neighborhoods the way they have done across the USA. and their ain&rsquo;t going to be anything they can do about it. The gutless social-climbing Talented Tenth have made it clear they have not intention whatsoever to back their bruthas and sistahs up. The Talented Tenth tell their poor black brethren and sistren that they have to suck it up and give their jobs to Mexicans who are also white-oppressed people of color. Which works fine for the Talented Tenth, of course. They live in big houses in white folks neighborhoods and rally don&rsquo;t care how many poor black folks there are  &mdash;  as long as they can get the tony high paying jobs and university slots from the white folks. Poor black folks know this on one level; they call the NAACP the National Association for the Advancement of Certain People. </p>
<p>Yup. It was clear that poor black folks were taking it up the whatever when jobs were offshored, but their black betters know exactly what buttons to push to get them to go along with their disenfranchisement.</p>

<p>Bloomberg is one of the richest individuals in the United States.  Population growth directly benefits him, and he wants it subsidized by the least wealthy taxpayers.</p>
<p>Nothing warms a billionaire&rsquo;s heart like the thought of thousands of earnest immigrants on the public dole, spending and consuming tax-payer&rsquo;s money which might otherwise escape their voracious appetites.</p>

		<p>Right. And while we&rsquo;re fantasizing, why don&rsquo;t we just pass a law requiring a certain percentage of college graduates to move to Detroit for a specified period of time? Same principle: that of controlling people&rsquo;s freedom of movement.</p>
<p>It seems obvious to me that before you can discuss strategies for &#8220;saving&#8221; Detroit anyway, you have to determine the reasons for the huge flight of residents from the city in the first place, even more so than in other urban areas. Until you understand that, no workable strategy can ever be proposed. </p>
<p>Of course, the real reasons are off limits for discussion, so don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>
<p>This business of bringing in more nonwhites into Detroit to cure Detroit&rsquo;s problems is like a heroin addict demanding another fix to &#8220;cure&#8221; his withdrawal symptoms.</p>

		<p>Bloomberg is delusional.  Typical &#8220;solution&#8221; from the mind of a liberal.  Like we need a Tijuana North right in our midst.  Not to mention between the hispanic gangs and the black gangs, Detroit would be a real life version of New York City in Escape from New York, only the bad guys wouldn&rsquo;t be white (as Hollyweird always tries to convince us.  When a city descends into hell on earth, it is only a select &#8220;diversity&#8221; which causes the descent.<br>

		<p>Interesting solution by Mayor Bloomdumb.</p>
<p>Take a city, half-abandoned, with sky-high unemployment, a disintegrating infrastructure, fleeing businesses, filled with chronically unemployed minorities, and - ship thousands of new immigrants to it!</p>
<p>Now, why didn&rsquo;t anybody else think of this brilliant solution to Detroit&rsquo;s problems.  Millions of new citizens could create a vibrant economy by selling groceries to each other, doing one another&rsquo;s laundry, washing each other&rsquo;s cars, and performing maid service to each other.  It would be the embodiment of the all-new service economy!  We&rsquo;ve already shown that we don&rsquo;t need to make anything.  That&rsquo;s what the Chinese, Japanese, Germans, and other silly proletarians are for.  </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s job is to consume! </p>

		<p>Sounds good to me, Mayor. If we build a wall around Detroit first and cut off all public aid to the residents, then the arrival of large groups of immigrants will be viewed in the same way as the arrival of do-gooder supply trucks in Africa.
