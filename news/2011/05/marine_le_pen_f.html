<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/magazine/mag-01LePen-t.html?_r=1">Marine Le Pen, France&rsquo;s (Kinder, Gentler) Extremist</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Shorto, New York Times, April 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>[Marine Le Pen has] come to dominate French newspapers and chat shows, where she is depicted variously as the new face of European bigotry or a herald of a new European political realignment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When I asked Le Pen to identify something from her childhood that formed her, she said, &#8220;20 kilos of dynamite.&#8221; In 1976, when she was 8, a bomb tore off the front of the family&rsquo;s apartment building in Paris while they were asleep. &#8220;I realized politics could cost you your life,&#8221; she said flatly. As the daughters of a greatly reviled politician, she and her two sisters grew up in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation  &mdash;  taunted by other children and shunned by teachers. &#8220;Our childhood was marked by a sense of injustice concerning our father,&#8221; her sister Yann Marechal wrote me in an e-mail. &#8220;We were the victims of many forms of attack,&#8221; Le Pen told me, &#8220;of virulent press campaigns and a lot of reprobation from the elites. That forged my character, and it also strengthened me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Le Pen may not become president, but some would argue that she has already succeeded. &#8220;Even if she never wins an election, when you release this kind of thinking into society, modernizing the packaging of racism, the consequences go on and on,&#8221; Patrick Loz√®s says. </p>
<p>The advances made by the National Front and other parties in Europe today  &mdash;  the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party, the Northern League in Italy, Geert Wilders&rsquo; Freedom Party in the Netherlands  &mdash;  are all based on the combination of anti-immigrant stances plus economic populism and national patriotism. Mainstream parties across Europe have not found answers to this movement, for which the term &#8220;far right&#8221; seems increasingly inadequate. &#8220;We could be looking at a great realignment of the political positions in Europe,&#8221; Laurent Bouvet [a professor of political science at the University of Nice who studies France&rsquo;s far right] says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a new populism. Marine Le Pen could lead it.&#8221; {snip}<br>

		<p><i>Racist, Extremist, Bigotry</i>! These terms have no denotation, only a vague connotation. The NYT has always promoted Liberalism, but it used to maintain a fairly high intellectual level. Apparently the NYT has embraced crudeness and ignorance. This must reflect the NYT&rsquo;s opinion of their readership. </p>

<p>There will be the politics of the majority center, and then there will be the far-left extremists who favor immigration.</p>

<p>Just taking those lines at face value, you would have thought her father ordered a genocide, or ordered his soldiers to rape children en masse, or used his powers of food distribution to starve tens of millions of people to death.  France couldn&rsquo;t have &#8220;greatly reviled&#8221; her father too much, because he was the leading vote-getter in the 2002 Presidential election after the first ballot.</p>

<i>When I asked Le Pen to identify something from her childhood that formed her, she said, &ldquo;20 kilos of dynamite.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I suspect the reporter wasn&rsquo;t look for his response. Since the focus of this piece is about Conservative &#8216;extremism&rsquo;, I have to wonder if the reporter was hoping she would reveal an incident in her youth that caused her to become a &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;the new face of European bigotry &#8220;</i></p>
<p>A swift and pre-emptive attack to brand her a &#8216;bigot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These liberal reporters are certainly quick to the story. It&rsquo;s almost as if someone is directing their every article. That can&rsquo;t be true because we all know there&rsquo;s no liberal media. </p>

		<p>The New York Times promotes illegal immigration and every bit of &#8220;pro diversity&#8221; nonsense.  I have long since learned that being called a &#8220;racist&#8221; or a &#8220;bigot&#8221; simply means you have won the argument.</p>

<p>So it is bigotry to want France to be French? Then what does the NY Times call it when the Blacks expel, or simply kill, White Rhodesians, and Boer South Africans? They have no problem with that, obviously.  </p>

<p>In truth, the French &#8220;Pied-noirs&#8221; were thrown out of Algeria because the General De Gaulle (who was in fact a healthy &#8220;racist&#8221;) wanted a complete split between the Arab and French populations, so he sacrificed them. If he had not done that, there would not be 6 million Arabs in mainland France, but 20 millions in a French/Algerian state, and the French economy would resemble that of Turkey, plus rampant ethnic strife. But despite that split, we nevertheless still slowly head towards Turkey.</p>
<p>It would take decades of revolution and civil war, and a total collapse of the state to allow the repatriation of our &#8220;guests&#8221;. So unfortunately, I believe that France became a multiracial nation like the USA. The Front National could do little against that.</p>

		<p>Le Pen the father &amp; the daughter have always been friends of Orthodox Slavs &amp; secular nationalist Arabs. The father met regularly with Zhirinovski, Seselj, Saddam &amp; Gadhafi in the 90s. I dont see Wilders pursuing the same policy today.</p>

<p>Very true.</p>
<p>Americans need to do the same and get away from the same old, same old Libertarian, Constitutionalist legal hair splitting that has trapped our people in failure for over 50 years.</p>
<p>libertarianism, economic conservative programs of letting business hire and fire whoever they like and letting markets determine wages - this is a recipe for driving our White working class to Neo Communism, to groups like the SEU.</p>
<p>The Front National is successful now because they made the correct decision in the 1970s to target White French steel workers and move them out of the Communist camp and in to the nationalist camp. </p>
<p>American WN must now do the same - embrace folks like the Teamsters Union over Florida and California (White) agribusiness owners that flood our nation with sub minimum wage slave NWs.</p>

		<p>The face of white resistance to the Marxist-globalist agenda will adapt to local conditions&hellip;and has. I have a great deal of faith in the French to save France&hellip;albeit not without bloodshed. The English are still so tied up with class issues that they will not attend to their own racial survival. They are divided and will be conquered. England is doomed to be the object lesson for the rest of Mother-Europe. Fight or die. Vive La Belle France! Vive Le Pen!</p>

		<p> Anyone who objects to the privileged global elites flooding their respected countries with Third World immigrants is an &#8220;extremist&#8221; according to the New York Times. Marine Le Pen is a patriot trying to preserve what is left of old France for future generations. The violence and slow genocide of whites in South Africa is not a problem with the &#8220;respectable&#8221; New York Times, but any public doubts about diversity or &#8220;Eurabia&#8221; is pure bigotry to their editorial board.</p>

Your point is valid. The NYT of 60 years ago would have called her a racist, extremist and bigot, and then would have given the reasons why she should be so classified. Today&rsquo;s NYT simply quotes diverse sources which do call her these names. It also uses these terms and LePen in close proximity, implicitly linking her to racism, extemism, and bigotry, without actually stating: LePen is a bigot, a racist, or an extremist. </p>
<p>Sixty years ago the NYT readership was intelligent; today it is vapid. The NYT is following the old carnival rule: You got to work the crowd that shows up.</p>

<p>I sure hope that the old degenerate rapist is correct. He&rsquo;s just like the primitives whom he supports and lest we forget his name IS Khan.<br>
France needs Le Pen although she does resent what she perceives as US meddling, I fear that she&rsquo;s right. We need to clean our own house before proposing to lecture others. France needs to restore in Gallic pride amd nationalism . One assumes that they are recovering from their bout with &#8220;tolerance&#8221; now that they see the destructive nature of those with whom they exercise it.<br>

The family has a closeness, and a dedication to an iconic ideal of the French state, that seems almost cultish. All three girls became party stalwarts; all married within the party.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>What is it with &#8216;Family Affairs&rsquo; as a pro-woman label and the realities of politics?  You don&rsquo;t get -anywhere- in politics unless you can swing an administrative infrastructure into place to execute your policies through delegation, like an army or a business.</p>
<p>This delegation is usually purchased, as payola to other groups for coming onboard your political platform and seldom has anything at all to do with commonality of identity.  Or &#8216;family&rsquo; (the mob should be so ruthless&hellip;).</p>
<p>Indeed, anytime you bring a &#8216;family&rsquo; attitude of inner-circle friends and in-house expertise, you become vulnerable to accusations of croneyism in what is seen as a business venture before anything else, by everyone else.</p>
<p>&#8216;Insular and exclusive = royal&rsquo; and frightens the Elitists who have made their fortunes on being part of an organized scheme of commercial disenfranchisement as fraud, selling out national -and- popular interests.</p>
<p>Small-and-tight doesn&rsquo;t work in a world where &#8216;getting past WWII&rsquo; is only possible whenever the opposition decides not to mention that Hitler spent 5 years on the road, driving around Germany between nationalist rallies, with only a small entourage of friends and fellow believers to keep him from being shot by enemies both foreign and domestic (46 assassination attempts by the time he was &#8216;elected&rsquo;).</p>
<p>This will not end well.  The moneyed French snobs will either frame her for some faux pax or, as a last resort, elect her with great reluctance and then isolate her narrow power base with greater numbers so that it seems whatever she attempts is derailed and sabotaged into ineffectuality.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie (the father) &#8216;didn&rsquo;t want to rule&rsquo;.  But Marine Le Penn must have a cognizant and driving will to do exactly that if she is truly to make her mark.  Which means making promises that are vile to people she wouldn&rsquo;t want anywhere near her &#8216;family&rsquo;.  Lest they disown her, like she did her mother.</p>
<p>Wrapping herself in the flag of a dead Republique and naming her children after past kings and heroes is just fantasy fluff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that, with &#8216;untold millions&rsquo; (Dead Jewish Ghosts vs. Her Father as much as Muslims vs. Gallic French) against her, adoption of the autocratic solution to France&rsquo;s ethnic identity problem is impossible.  And without a common thread of enough-is-enough coming from other EU statesmen looking for an escape clause from &#8216;The Prisoner&rsquo; like EU subjugation of racial identity, there will never be a bloodless solution that any French politician, let alone an &#8216;all in the family&rsquo; woman, can achieve.</p>
<p>The alternative is longterm denial of services shutdown of ethnic privilege and a very hard shoulder turned against further attempted immigration, to include criminal charges, for those whose &#8216;point of origin&rsquo; exceeds that of EU borderless enforcement authority.</p>
<p>And Le Front Nationale will not survive such a war of attrition before the Elites find a way to embarrass them out of office.  Public opinion being like a goldfish&rsquo; memory: intense to any immediate stimulus but lacking in longterm recall of purpose.</p>

<p>I sure hope that the old degenerate rapist is correct. He&rsquo;s just like the primitives whom he supports and lest we forget his name IS Khan.<br>

		<p><b>It is Strauss-Khan.</b></p>
<p>We often read here about those vague, mysterious &#8220;elites&#8221;. They are like fictitious creatures you only read about, but never see. Fairies in the air, whose existence is doubtful.  Well, here is one of them, nabbed red-handed, and photographed while in police custody. Attempting to escape the country in his first class seat on Air France.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the Socialist Party&rsquo;s darling, please note! (He got his start as a Communist, btw.)  How&rsquo;s  that for a joke?</p>
<p>I do hope those toiling French workers back home  who support the Socialists are reading up carefully  on this story.  This man, known for his lavish tastes and  lifestyle was staying in a $3,000. a night suite in a luxury  NY hotel.  Yes, a true  representative of the working class!   </p>
<p>This shows how their workers&rsquo; movement has been subverted by cynical opportunists like him. Oh, and read up also on his wife, Ann &#8220;Sinclair&#8221;,  a very influential French-American journalist in France. That&rsquo;s not her real name by the way, and she is no more French or American than he is.  Neither one has a drop of French blood. (He grew up in Morocco, son of a Tunisian-Moroccan family. But I see that his Wiki biog has already been re-written since yesterday!!!) She grew up sort of here, sort of there, but not part of either.  Both come from wealth.</p>
<p>These are the people running the International Monetary Fund and regulating what French viewers see on TV; they are the people who determine what news we hear, what opions we have, and what our money is worth. These are the mysterious, un-elected, shadowy &#8220;elite&#8221; who control our destinies from behind the curtain. But sometimes they slip up, as he just did.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder why France is in the perilous shape that it is? At least Marine LePen is really  French and is representative of France and the French people. But that would be politically incorrect to mention, and probably illegal in France.</p>
