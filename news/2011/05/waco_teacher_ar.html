<h1>Waco Teacher Arrested After Student Attacked for Racial Slurs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Cuoco, ABC News (Waco), May 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roberta Buck, 58, was a teacher at Cesar Chavez Middle school.  She was arrested for endangering one of her students.</p>
<p>According to arrest warrant, Buck didn&rsquo;t allow her class to watch to watch a movie after one of her students complained about the film.</p>
<p>Waco ISD police said Buck had a private conversation, outside the classroom, with the student about the movie.</p>
<p>It was there that the student told Buck that he didn&rsquo;t like African Americans, but he referred to them using the &#8220;N-word&#8221; or something similar.</p>
<p>Buck then reportedly went back relayed that information to her predominantly African American class (78.26%).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The warrant goes on to say that Buck gave the class permission to hit the student who made the comment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what his classmates reportedly did in the hallway after class. Buck supposedly didn&rsquo;t stop her students from hitting the teen in head, back and shoulders. All while he covered his head and tried to protect himself.</p>

Comrade Buck has learned well. Whites are evil and they must be outed and punished for their thought crimes. She has proven herself a loyal citizen to the glorious new state!</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if she suffers some extra-judicial justice. In my opinion, she deserves it.</p>

		<p>This kid learned a hard, but important lesson.</p>
<p>Likely, he thought he was explaining to someone who knew why he was having problems at that school and didn&rsquo;t want to be there, because she had the exact same experiences as him.  A fellow victim of black vileness.</p>
<p>Little did he know that he was talking to a race traitor, who was actively involved in aiding and abetting the bad stuff that was happening to him.  It is not an accident that he is a minority white in a majority black school, likely subject to assault on a regular basis.  That situation was purposefully created by evil people in the hopes that he would be harmed, even killed.  One of them saw the opportunity to escalate this immediately to a murder, and took it.  Going just a little to far, her actions gained notice and made white people start to know that was being done is purposeful.</p>
<p>Make no mistake.  If one day, whites wake up to this and punish the guilty, she will stand trial for genocide&hellip;..and face execution.  Her intent was crystal clear.  A beating now, followed up by a murder later.  And where there is smoke, there is fire.  You will find a long list of similar behavior from her, and possibly several dead bodies, victims of unsolved &#8220;crime&#8221;, if any reasonable amount of scrutiny is applied to her career.</p>
<p>Take note of this.  Liberals are not well meaning, but clueless people.  They know what they are doing.  They are motivated by hate and their hands are drenched in blood.  They are accountable for millions of murders, rapes, assault, ethnic cleansing and genocide&hellip;.INTENTIONALLY.  That demands an appropriate response.  It demands justice.  Impossible under today&rsquo;s corrupt system, the future still remains a possibility.</p>
<p>The nazis, when they did what they did, did so with impunity.  It was unthinkable that they would ever be brought to justice.  But after all the time that has passed, they are still being found and being held to account.  And the nazis held germany in a grip far stronger than today&rsquo;s neo-communist liberals hold America.<br>

		<p>Thanks to the internet, many of us these days get to read crime stories from around the world.<br>
From this exposure and the shocked reactions of the accused, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that black and brown people are yet to realise that name calling is an inadequate defense for physical assault.<br>
Hollywood probably has something to do with that.</p>

		<p>If you ever find yourself in the precarious position of being publicly judged as a racist in front of a large racially mixed crowd, who deem your impending assault as justified. </p>
<p>Make it clear that the only racial prejudice you hold is regarding the violent nature of blacks or browns. </p>
<p>So at least the impending violent punishment that is about to be executed onto your person, will prove your apprehensions as self fulfilling. </p>
<p>This idea isn&rsquo;t very practical, but the irony makes me smile.<br>

		<p> Hopefully the young man&rsquo;s parents will sue the pants off both the school system and the teacher. And, by the way, if any of the black students who beat him can be identified, shouldn&rsquo;t they be arrested for battery? The story didn&rsquo;t even mention that.</p>

		<p>Hopefully, this blond bimbo will have a hard time finding another job.</p>
<p>The kid whose confidence she violated will be bullied, beaten,  and picked on by all the primitives at that school for as long as he&rsquo;s there&hellip;.or unless he&rsquo;s killed first.</p>
<p>Blacks swarm and mob, and my theory is that it is part of their psyche, just as it is part of the psyche of other primates on the African continent.</p>
<p>Personally, I think she should be charged with aiding and abetting felonious assault, and if the kid IS killed, she should be tried for aiding and abetting murder, no matter if it occurs a year from now.</p>

		<p>Remember folks, this teacher had a &#8220;private&#8221; conversation with this student, so we only have her word that he uttered the N word. After her actions, can we really believe what she said, or was she exaggerating to justify her actions somehow? Another question is, was this a white student or a different minority? The media usually tries to hide the fact that blacks and other minorties don&rsquo;t get along, to them it&rsquo;s always a black/white thing and whitey is ALWAYS at fault.</p>

		<p>1) If the conversation took place privately in the hallway then why is this story reported as if the student actually used a racial slur? Shouldn&rsquo;t the story say &#8220;alleged&#8221;? After all, are we to take the word of a teacher charged with endangering a student? And why wasn&rsquo;t she charged with inciting a hate crime?</p>
<p>2) I&rsquo;m curious to know some personal details regarding this teacher. Is she a bitter divorcee? Is she involved with a black man? Is she involved with a black <i>woman</i>? Does she have mixed children? Is she a left-wing radical? I&rsquo;m guessing that at least two of those apply.</p>
<p>3) I wonder how long it will take before Jane Elliot hires this woman as an assistant.</p>

I agree with both of you. While I am no fan of Black (or Hispanics or most Non-Whites) for that matter, I cannot believe the number of posters making excuses for this kid who had no business whatsoever using such language!</p>
<p>I agree the teacher needs to be disciplned for physically endangering a minor, there is no way that we can excuse this kids deplorable behavior.  <br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s say a Black Student told a Black teacher that he did not like &#8220;White trash&#8221; or &#8220;Crackers&#8221; or some racially loaded slur when the two of them had private conversation out in the hall. </p>
<p>Afterwards, she tells the predominately White class what he said. Afterwards, they immediately attack him and physically endanger his health while she turns the other way and pretends not to notice.  </p>
<p>Would many of you respond in the same manner that you have responded to this incident? I seriously doubt it. While promoting and advocating violence on anyone is unacceptable and th eacher in question was justly punished and imprisoned, many of you are making some lame excuses for this child who had no business uttering such disgusting language.</p>

<p>You guys just don&rsquo;t get it. He said it to ONLY a WHITE person and in a PRIVATE, PERSONAL CONVERSATION. Do you guys understand the meaning of the word PRIVATE? The blacks were ONLY AWARE of it because this evil woman BETRAYED his CONFIDENCE - a truly despicable thing to do.</p>
<p>By the way, what do you guys think blacks call us when we are not around? And frequently even when we are..</p>

		<p> Whites must come together as a solid group or run the risk of being made slaves seperately. <br>
 In some sense we are already slaves. Welfare, food stamps, section 8 housing, affirmative action and all the other &#8220;entitlements&#8221; are draining our bank accounts at a much accelerated rate with each passing year.<br>
 Black and Hispanic college professors openly call for the genocide of the white race, and not a word of dissent from anyone in the white race.<br>
 I fear for my children and grandchildren and all whites of the future as our numbers shrink and their hatred grows stronger. Their political clout continues to grow and their politicians are openly hostile to anyone who is not &#8220;their people&#8221;.<br>
 All this and much more, yet they still claim that they cannot be labeled racist. That&rsquo;s a derogatory term reserved for the hated whites.</p>

<p>You must have no experience with children-especially male children-and have no recollection of your own childhood. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to expect anything approaching consistently good judgment from anyone under 18.I would go older except for the fact that 19 year old platoon leaders in WW2 and Vietnam-and some of them might have had pretty good judgment. Especially the ones who conferred closely with their senior NCO&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>IN any case, nothing excuses a mature adult who incites a violent <br>
mob action against a minor in her charge. She should be charged   with a whole STRING of felonies. </p>

		<p>The white children I feel most sorry for, are those who attend predominately black public schools. Their hours in school are filled with nothing but torment, harassment, threats and actual violence. Their plight, is one largely ignored by the main stream media. I don&rsquo;t care how poor one is; if you are white, you simply must not enroll your children in a predominantly black school. One can live cheaply out in rural and small town America. The harm done to your children may be irreparable.</p>

<p><br>
The teacher needs to go to prison for incitement of an assault against one of her students. If the races were reversed (as we tediously have to keep repeating) she could be facing up to 10 years in federal custody. I&rsquo;m basing that on the case of a dumb cross-burner who received a 10-year sentence despite the fact that no one was injured and there was no property damage. Ron Smith (WBAL) mentioned the case on his radio show yesterday. </p>

		<p>Post #4 hits the nail on the head. I think I&rsquo;m more amazed at the constant political bantering and deductive reasoning being used to analyze these events. The seeds have been sown and the fruit is being beared. To rationalize or dissect all of this is irrelevant.  The problem for whites is that these people are amongst us, not with us, many of the woman lost to black or non-white interests and most of the rest turned into puppets of the new multicultural world order of things.</p>

<p>This teacher should be fired and attend sensitivity training and anger management class since this obviously made her angry enough to want to injure a child.                     </p>

<p>To heck with the N word! It has been banned simply for ONE reason! It &#8220;offends&#8221; blacks!  Why not ban Redneck and cracker? That is  truly demeaning words blacks call us? </p>
<p> Black professors call for KILLING Whites of the planet and most blacks call us all sorts of names and that is okay?   Yet, you worry about the stupid N word? </p>

		<p>The teacher is at fault here. She related what the other kid said to her in confidence- if he even said the n word to begin with- and allowed the beating. I have worked with kids and one of the first things we were told was that you could not allow a kid or group of kids to hit or beat up another kid based on what they did or said. This was considered punishment by extension and punished as if you beat the kid yourself.</p>

		<p>the student needs to be disciplined for his behavior as well. Using such a vile word is uncalled for.  &hellip;While I am no fan of Black (or Hispanics or most Non-Whites) for that matter, I cannot believe the number of posters making excuses for this kid who had no business whatsoever using such language!</p>
<p>I agree the teacher needs to be disciplned for physically endangering a minor, there is no way that we can excuse this kids deplorable behavior.    &mdash;  - John<br>
_____________________________</p>
<p>No, John.  I think you are taking this too far.   This is still the USA (isn&rsquo;t it?)   Since when do we have language crimes?</p>
<p>A kid that age only knows what he hears at home. Probably  that&rsquo;s the way his family speaks. How would he know any better?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if he&rsquo;s in a class that&rsquo;s nearly 4/5ths black, he must be accustomed to hearing that word all day long. Hundreds of times a day.  He may not be old enough to grasp the subtle distinction  that they can use it, but he can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I agree that use of that indelicate word was unwise and indiscrete, for an adult   &mdash;    but not illegal or punishable (especially in a private conversation).</p>

<p><i>How often do you think black students are punished for using the word cracker or calling the teacher a white bitch?</i></p>
<p>Alex:</p>
<p>Thank you for writing the most intelligent, succinct, pertinent comment on the entire thread.</p>
<p>You perfectly summed up the hypocrisy of the Reign of Terror we Whites, both students and teachers, are under in the educational system in BRA.</p>
<p>I worked in a black school for a number of years and was entirely defeated by the wretched experience.  Blacks both adults and youth, are allowed to spew the most vile invective at Whites every day   &mdash;   we are called &#8220;crackers&#8221;, &#8220;red necks&#8221;, &#8220;Nazis&#8221;   &mdash;  and those are the NICE terms.  </p>
<p>I was called this to my face day in and day out and these are only the names I can report.  I was called these hateful racist things by students AND parents.   I wrote up  and reported these incidents as racial and sexual, mostly both, with NOTHING ever happening to either the students or their parents.  EVER.  Nothing was ever done  &mdash;   and that includes by my lame &#8220;union&#8221; as well, which I am mandated to be a part of in California as we are a &#8220;closed shop&#8221; here.  (surprised?).</p>
<p>But, there were a few positives to come out of this life-changing experience:  I learned that blacks hate us Whites with every fiber of their being, down to their bone marrow.  They live White Hatred!!  Being forced to use White- hating textbooks and a mostly surly black &#8220;support&#8221; staff (clerks. etc.) didn&rsquo;t help, along with having to suffer through White-hating professional developments where I was told that White oppression and poverty are responsible for the black/White achievement gap.</p>
<p>I was extremely lucky to have escaped with the help of a very nervous, retiring White principal who used his connections to help the few White teachers that he liked.  I am forever grateful&hellip;</p>
<p>As for the incident above, the kid probably didn&rsquo;t use the N word, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe a word that idiot teacher said.  Not One Word. I also lean toward the kid most likely being Hispanic, especially at a school named after Cesar Chavez (who is about to have a naval ship named after him!!). And, hispanics do use this word, freely, as I&rsquo;ve heard around California.  Not surprising considering the harm inflicted upon hispanics by blacks before hispanic numbers allowed them to begin ethnically cleansing blacks out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I have no problem with this White-hating teacher losing her job, but not her pension since most (but not all) of it was extracted from her paycheck, at least that much should be returned.</p>
<p>But, as #5 states, she may be given a Diversity Award and honored for &#8220;rooting our insidious White racism.</p>
<p>And yes, read Michael C Scott&rsquo;s suggestion above and then DO IT!!  And, as I&rsquo;ve repeatedly said here:  Don&rsquo;t look back.  </p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>You must have no experience with children-especially male children-and have no recollection of your own childhood. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to expect anything approaching consistently good judgment from anyone under 18.I would go older except for the fact that 19 year old platoon leaders in WW2 and Vietnam-and some of them might have had pretty good judgment. Especially the ones who conferred closely with their senior NCO&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>IN any case, nothing excuses a mature adult who incites a violent <br>
mob action against a minor in her charge. She should be charged with a whole STRING of felonies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quite the contrary, I have considerable contact with young people. I run two college preparatory businesses. Moreover, I am the mother of three adult boys. In my sixteen years, of establishing my businesses, I have onyl had one student (yes, a male) use that disgusting word. I immedaitely asked him to leave and informed his parents that I would no longer have them as clients. In fact, his mother seemed to be genuinely shocked by his behavior.</p>
<p>As for my childhood, my parents (or grandparents for that matter)never uttered such a repulsive word around me or my three older siblings. I will admit, that I did hear some fellow students use the word, but very rarely. It just was not done. As for my sons, neither my ex-husband or I would ever tolerate such language in our home or raised our kids to use such langauge. </p>
<p>While we did let them know that we beleived that there were genuine differences between Whites and Non Whites and that many Blacks and other non-Whites were not worth too much of thier time, however, there are some good, decent, respectable ones. However, even in regards to the no good ones, we still did not refer to them as N**ge*s!!!  Again, I will say that such a word is unacceptable to use! Period.        </p>

To Ms. Conservative Manners:</p>
<p>One of the great lies of integration is that racism is the result of ignorance when the opposite is true. Racial awareness is the result of direct contact and experience. If blacks moved into white neighborhoods and they maintained the same standards of behavior, most whites wouldn&rsquo;t move out. It&rsquo;s the contact and experience with &#8216;authentic&rsquo; black behavior that causes whites to become racially aware.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that this young boy used that word because to him, it expressed his experience with blacks in his school. He didn&rsquo;t use the word out of ignorance, he used it because of his experience with blacks.</p>
<p>Should the boy have known better than to use such a word? According to the rules of political correctness, he should have.</p>
<p>The question you need to ask yourself is WHY did he use THAT particular word when he likely SHOULD have known better.</p>
<p>The answer is obvious. He experienced blacks as they really and he likely suffered long standing abuse from blacks.</p>
<p>Even if you believe he shouldn&rsquo;t have used that word, the teacher never, never never, should have revealed that to his black classmates. Not only did it put him in real physical danger, it was a breech of trust between a teacher and a student, an adult and a child, one human being to another.</p>
<p>What the teacher did is far more reprehensible than what this boy told the teacher in a PRIVATE conversation. </p>
<p>If your son used that word in anger to a teacher in a private conversation (and I know YOUR children would never do that), would you support the teacher in repeating his private conversation to anyone else? Would you support the teacher who then stood by and let your child be beaten by his fellow student?</p>
<p>There is NO justification for what this &#8216;teacher&rsquo; did. NONE! She not only violated a personal trust, she put this young boy in real danger.</p>
<p>If this teacher didn&rsquo;t like him using that word, she should have contacted the parent and spoken to them in private.</p>
<p>Whatever punishment this teacher gets will never be enough for me. If this boy was my child and she violated his trust, I would have been at that school first thing in the morning, likely with a baseball bat in my hand.</p>

		<p>Speaking of the N word, ever heard 2 or more blacks talking or rather screeching?  Every other word is the N word.  Most black school students use the N word as an term of address.</p>
<p>Hey N, wass up?  Hey N gown a sool aday?  That N is a MF hero.</p>
<p>I recently sat on a city bus.  There were only a few passengers.  A well dressed young black man was on his cell phone.  He was talking about his baby nephew, the &#8220;mos beautiful lil N I evah seen&#8221;  He only had about 4 sentences, but he endless repeated then for about 30 minutes until he got off, still yammering away.</p>
<p>He referred to his &#8220;beautiful&#8221; little nephew as a N at least 2 hundred times.  Ever been near a school, elementary, middle or high when the kids get out?  If there are more than 2 blacks in the whole crowd, you will hear them refer to themselves and other blacks as Ns.</p>
<p>If blacks can use the N word, why can&rsquo;t Whites?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve never taught any black kids or listened to any adult black men talking among themselves have you?  If you had in your 40 years or more, you would have heard the blacks repeat the N word endlessly.</p>
<p>Blacks often use the N word instead of a person&rsquo;s proper name when speaking with each other.  It&rsquo;s not, hey Bill, ain seen yoo roun, its hey N word ain seen yoo roun.</p>
<p>I bet the student who was beaten by the blacks was Hispanic.  They at least have courage, critical mass and backing of the liberal aristocrats.  So it is possible for Hispanics to stand up against blacks.</p>
<p>Whites who dare to stand up against blacks are lynched by the government.</p>
<p>Ever been threatened with losing your job because you refused to sleep with a disgusting lecher of a black man?  Ever been threatened with gang rape by disgusting black men with whom you have to work?  When that happens to you as it happened to me and thousands upon thousands of White women since 1964 you have the right to speak about racial matters.   I have.  And I have little liking for Whites like you and Roberta Buck.</p>
<p>I have to put up with Whites like you all the time Ms Conservative Manners. Amren is for race realists, not idiot intelligentsia liberals like you.  </p>
<p>You say you ran a college prep business.  Is that one of those counseling for parents businesses where you tell parents how to get their child into a good college?</p>
<p>If you actually do run such a business, you must be aware of the totally vicious discrimination against Whites in college admissions.</p>
<p>The easiest way for a White with an IQ of 105, GPA of 2.3 and mediocre SAT scores to get a full scholarship to the Ivy league is to dispense with all the community service and extra curricular activities and just check the box that says black or African American.</p>
<p>The way for a White with an IQ of 140, advanced placement GPA of 4. and perfect SAT and ACT scores to get turned down at every college he applies to is to check the White box.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any difference between MS Conservative Manners and Roberta Buck.</p>

		<p>Certain posters make it very clear that they would NEVER NEVER us the N-word.  Good for them.  One poster even goes to great lengths to show frequent dealings with youths of this age, and in her household one would NEVER use that word.  God for her.  Really.  Good for them.  But then their lofty view breaks down.  The kid used the N-word IN PRIVATE to what he thought was another white who would understand.  And, given the percentage of blacks in the class, I have NO doubt they were acting just like what he called them. That white race traitor then betrayed the kid and encouraged a pack attack on him.  You know, the kind of attack that when heard or seen, quite easily produces the N-word as a descriptor.</p>
<p>Look.  Used to be this was a country that had freedoms.  Now, we have none.  The blacks are defining what freedoms we may have, and they are getting fewer and fewer.  And the rationale becomes more ridiculous.  <br>

<p>Well, I guess Ms. Conservative manners told us all what is and isn&rsquo;t acceptable, right? Just like what blacks tell us what we can and cannot say or do? Do you even think that 95% of blacks even know the meaning of the word, manners? </p>
<p>Let me ask you something, &#8220;patting yourself on the back&#8221; Ms Conservative, have you or your family ever spoke out to black people who call us names, rape, beat murder Whites and you find the N word unacceptable?  Have you ever told THEM that it is unacceptable&#8221; as you feel free to tell  us the N word is? </p>
<p>Sorry, but I find your self righteous, higher than thou attitude, UNACCEPTABLE.  That White kid in a sea of black faces in that school more than likely has gotten fed up with the bullying, the downright propaganda he was being fed for years, so give HIM a break for using one simple little n word! </p>

<p>If you all are so horrified and shocked by the N word, I suggest that you go to the nearest middle or high school in your area that has a 10 percent or more black student body around 2/30 any week day afternoon. Park your car.</p>
<p>There are always bus stops in fron of schools.  Settle down on the bus bench with a soda and a book.  Stay there until 4/30.</p>
<p>You will hear the black students calling each other the N word thousands of times in those 2 hours.</p>
<p>Punish the student who uttered the N word?  Did they punish the students who beat him to a pulp?</p>
<p>Since you all are so articulate and intellectual and high level and above us racist trailer trash rednecks, I suggest you read 1984 and Animal Farm.</p>

<p>Blacks use the word N  &mdash;    &mdash;  - all the time. Get off your high horse. </p>
<p>As for that teacher she should be sued and imprisoned. If that was my child she did that too, and she didn&rsquo;t receive what I felt was adequate punishment from the criminal-justice system, I would settle the matter privately - old school.</p>

Just laugh it off? No matter that they call for killing ALL whites off the planet and their White cracker babies&hellip;It means nothing, right? Just don&rsquo;t dare utter the N word. </p>
<p>You sound like a PC lemming. Can&rsquo;t you think of many more words that are used daily that should really be banned in public? I can.</p>
<p>Whites get their panties in a bunch when it comes to some nonwhites and their &#8220;sensibilities&#8221;. Have you heard the new banned word to come about?  Mexican. Yes, Mexican! Yet some of these same Whites will never say or do anything when people of their OWN race are targeted for extinction, raped, murdered, assaulted, called bigots, racists, nazis, if they dare utter the stupid N word? </p>

That we have to resort to circumlocutions as &#8216;the N word&rsquo; is pathetic when that particular word aptly describes so many lumpen blacks.</p>
<p>Frankly for those folks it&rsquo;s not a derogatory adjective but a proper noun. It shouldn&rsquo;t be used casually but when it&rsquo;s appropriate it&rsquo;s appropriate. <br>
