			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Pearson, Chicago Times, May 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A coalition of ethnic and religious groups today proposed a legislative redistricting map that would create 11 new state House and Senate districts in which a majority of the voting-age population are racial or ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Currently, the state House has 32 so-called majority-minority districts and the Senate has 13 similar districts. The proposal from the United Congress of Community and Religious Organizations would result in 38 majority-minority districts in the House and 18 in the Senate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chicago lost about 200,000 residents over the past decade, primarily in the African-American community. At the same time, the Latino population grew by 33 percent, primarily in the suburbs.</p>
<p>With tensions developing over whether Latinos would potentially gain legislative seats at the expense of African-American majority districts, more than 20 organizations representing Hispanic, black and Asian groups signed onto the coalition map. Despite African American population declines, the map would preserve the existing 18 House and eight Senate districts on Chicago&rsquo;s West and South Sides that have a black majority population  &mdash;  and keep intact an African-American majority district in East St. Louis.</p>
<p>At the same time, the coalition proposal would create add another two House districts and a Senate district with majority Latino population on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side and add a Hispanic-majority district in Aurora. In addition, the map proposes another nine new majority-minority state House districts and five Senate districts outside Chicago  &mdash;  in Franklin Park, Evanston, Waukegan, Rockford, the Elgin-Carpentersville corridor, Schaumburg, West Chicago and Romeoville.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stand here today with our Latino brothers and sisters to say, &#8216;You&rsquo;re gain is not my loss  &mdash;  that the only way any of us will win is if we win together,&rsquo;&#8221; said Rev. Robin Hood, pastor of Redeemed Outreach Ministries in North Lawndale and executive director of a group of West Side pastors.</p>
<p>C.W. Chen, chairman of the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, said the map creates three districts in which the Asian population constitutes at least 20 percent. Chen successfully worked for a new law aimed at keeping the Chinatown area from being split into several districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;As minority communities, we have a shared destiny, a shared interest and a shared experience,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;Any equitable redistricting for one group should not have to be at the expense of another.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is good news, and we support its widespread approval.</p>
<p>Whites deserve to lose, because if it weren&rsquo;t for Whites, we wouldn&rsquo;t have Emancipation without Colonization, Integration without Safeguards, Civil Rights without Civil Society, Affirmative Action without Equal Treatment, Diversity without Security, Interfaith without Sharia, etc.</p>
<p>Whites allowed our politicans and elites to put us under the boot heels of our sworn enemies, so who are we to complain when we get stomped upon even harder?</p>

		<p>The Democrats run both the State House and Senate in Illinois with fairly comfortable majorities, even after Republican gains last November, including flipping the House district in which I lived for most of 2010.  However, these gerrymandered maps will help Republicans get close or turn one or both houses in the near future, perhaps sometime in this coming decade.</p>
<p>However, the Illinois Republicans are by and large a bunch of noxious RINOs, so it wouldn&rsquo;t matter anyway.  Almost all of them seem to take their cues from that most famous Illinois Republican.</p>

		<p>Non-white immigration is spawning ethnic autonomous zones. </p>
<p>By all means, voluntary segregation should be encouraged and supported. If they can&rsquo;t be expelled, this is the next best thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the best and the brightest will try to migrate to all-white areas to escape their less competent kin.</p>

		<p>Blacks in Illinois want to have their cake and eat it too. They don&rsquo;t understand simple math and don&rsquo;t understand the concept of democracy, obviously. </p>
<p>If Latinos grow in population, that means more Latino state Representatives will go to Springfield. If blacks decline in population, that means there will be less black state Representatives will go to Springfield. It&rsquo;s really simple. </p>
<p>You cannot expect to maintain the same number of seats in the state capitol when your numbers have declined. That is illogical and un-democratic. </p>
<p>The black community in Chicago, like the black community everywhere, have this entitlement mentality and believe that they are somehow entitled to be overrepresented because they are black and they are &#8220;special&#8221; and nobody should question it. </p>

Blacks constantly accuse and condemn Republicans for gerrymandering and yet minorities can create their own racial and ethnic enclaves with impunity.</p>

Oh, really? But it is okay for WHITES to lose out, right? Same ole story in a multiracial paradiise</p>
<p><br>
Well you, Mr Chen and your latino brothers and sisters spare us your &#8220;love&#8221; for one another at our expense, while we work on permanently separating ourselves from all this &#8220;rich diversity&#8221; that we have come to hate with a passion.</p>
<p>My White brothers and sisters, when are we going to say enough of this anti-White agenda against us in our own land? They have been playing the HATE card against us for a very long time and they say it to our faces, while we have to be silent and &#8220;pretend&#8221; we didn&rsquo;t notice their out and out hatred. We are being slapped silly time and again and it is time we slapped back.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes Mr. Chen. This is an environmental certainty that one group&rsquo;s loss is another&rsquo;s gain. And &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Robin Hood, aka, Jeremiah Wright. Now all of a sudden they are his &#8220;Latino brothers and sisters.&#8221; That will last for exactly 5 seconds after a rival gang shootout takes place between the two ethnic groups, and it will be a plea to chastise those same &#8220;Latino brothers and sisters.&#8221; As Whites let&rsquo;s watch it all play out. Even the Asians will play their hand to where it&rsquo;s advantageous to THEIR population.</p>

<p>Unless it is at the expense of the WHITE group, of course.   Redistricting has become the political equivalent of bussing for education and Block Busting in the realty world.<br>
It&rsquo;s ALL about invading, and replacing, the Whites.  In this particular case, it&rsquo;s about tilting future elections to always favor the &#8220;diversities&#8221; and their liberal plantation owners.<br>

		<p>If racial classifications (i.e. &#8216;Asian&rsquo;) are outdated then so too should any attempt to lump-sum gain political power by gerrymandering them when in fact what is meant is -national- classification: aka Chinese/Japanese/Korean etc..  Indeed I find it particularly ironic that-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
C.W. Chen, chairman of the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Has such a narrow view of race that he can honestly say-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;As minority communities, we have a shared destiny, a shared interest and a shared experience,&rdquo; Chen said. &ldquo;Any equitable redistricting for one group should not have to be at the expense of another.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When last I read, you dare not put a Chinese, Korean or Japanese in the same jail cell for fear of their killing each other.</p>
<p>OTOH, _whites_ whose &#8216;shared interest&rsquo; is that of having built the only functional nation state on the planet, who have indeed PROVEN that we can get along and create social progress, even with a history of unresolved civil war resentments.</p>
<p>Are the only ones being criticized and dispossessed for what we have done.</p>
<p>Mr./Mz. Chen:  Your shared destiny is that of the home nations you came from, where you are not a minority.  How dare you assume that your &#8216;shared destiny&rsquo; is to ruin what another race has created independently of your own efforts and which you now seek to openly sabotage.</p>
<p>Whites have to get away from these people.  We have to once more carve out a land that is our own and ours _to own_.  Or we will have nothing at all.</p>
<p>Look at the Diaspora for how long it takes to fix that mistake.</p>
