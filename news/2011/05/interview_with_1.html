<p>Because the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; today are as bad as the left is, when it comes to anything that may suggest Whites are on the endangered list and are blamed for all the worlds ills.  In fact, I think the &#8220;right&#8221; is as anti-White as the libs are. </p>
<p>They NEVER give our race as deserving of anything and would call each and every one of us, including Jared Taylor, a disgusting racist. I have heard it time after time about sites such as Amren and other WN sites as being hate sites and are repugnant to these &#8220;conservatives&#8221;.</p>
<p> But, they have no problem in lifting up blacks, &#8220;hispanics&#8221; or whatever. But let some White defend our race and speak about nonwhite violence, welfare dependency, IQ, unwed mothers, etc. and you will be in for a tongue lashing. This is why I am no longer a &#8220;conservative&#8221; and will not associate with those who praise them at every turn.</p>

<p>The fear factor.<br>
Today nobody can pretend that America will become a third world nation. Hence the cause of AmRen et al is so much the easier, hence the increased repression.</p>

		<p>Russia Today was the only part of the video media that interviewed Jared Taylor after the fascist &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; used death threats to shut down the 2010 American Renaissance conference.</p>
<p>Would they be willing to interview Jared Taylor about his latest book?</p>
<p>I just finished the book and it&rsquo;s every bit as good as I expected it to be.  Every page is crammed with facts that the powers that be would like to suppress. </p>

		<p>Very interesting interview and superb points made by Mr. Taylor as usual. </p>
<p>I particularly liked when a caller mentioned that he could celebrate his Irish heritage, and Mr. Taylor pointed out that it&rsquo;s allowable for whites to celebrate their individual ethnic heritage, but not to celebrate their greater European heritage. It&rsquo;s part of how our controllers keep the white masses divided. </p>
<p>I also liked how another caller mentioned how there really don&rsquo;t seem to be any ethnic slurs toward whites that have the same power as, say, the &#8220;n-word,&#8221; and Taylor pointed out that that&rsquo;s because whites aren&rsquo;t <i>allowed</i> to take offense, or at least the kind of offense that other races take at ethnic slurs.</p>
<p>As usual, Mr. Taylor made so many good points and what he said was so perfectly reasonable that the only way huge numbers of people wouldn&rsquo;t agree with him is that they don&rsquo;t get to hear his message (which is the very reason his message is suppressed).</p>

<p>National Review was the &#8220;baby&#8221; of Bill Buckley. Bill was born in Mexico, his first language was Spanish [?], he had a home staffed by Mexican servants to which he spoke only Spanish, etc.</p>

<p>As to slurs considered as bad as the N-word, we&rsquo;ve been told for decades that it&rsquo;s the worst possible racial epithet, so much more hideous than any other.  Why?  Because the PC people making that declaration apparently think there&rsquo;s something really, really wrong about being black and that black folks are helpless victims who must be accorded extra protection.  It&rsquo;s okay for blacks themselves to use the N-word because, seemingly, they&rsquo;re innocent pawns of vicious white racists who&rsquo;ve taught them the awful word!  IMO, these lefty whites are the most obvious racists of all.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care what ethnic slur people apply to me as long as I can equally apply one back.  But, of course, that can no longer be done publicly.  Thus, there is a commonly used slur at which I take offense because it&rsquo;s used so casually, and that&rsquo;s gringo.  The Hispanics tossing off this term could easily say Anglo.  It also has two syllables and is one of their own words.  Their hateful intent is obvious.</p>

<p>Jack replies.</p>
<p>yes, you are correct. But back in the early 1990s, the Neo Conservatives hadn&rsquo;t yet taken over establishment conservative magazines like National Review. Once the Neo Cons took over at NR and other establishment Conservative magazines and think tanks, they purged virtually any and all White writers who dared mention subjects like mass immigration, racial crime etc. The Neo Cons pushed the program of:</p>
<p>1) Invade the world<br>
2) Invite the world - mass immigration from everywhere except Europe<br>
3) In hoc to the world to pay for 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer and Peter Brimelow at Vdare have written extensively about this.</p>
<p>Most of the American &#8220;conservative&#8221; public falls for the Neo Con con job and is distracted by the endless foreign wars, and think Conservatives, RINOs like John McCain and Lindsey Graham really are tough on crime, strong on defending our borders etc.</p>

&#8220;&hellip;it&rsquo;s okay to celebrate one&rsquo;s individual White ethnic identity..&#8221; No it ain&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s only tolerated for the time being. First of all at the highest levels they&rsquo;re pushing, &#8220;there&rsquo;s no such thing as the White race&#8221; and &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221;. In this country they are targeting the unique culture of the Southern Whites (Colonial Williamsburg, Confederate heritage, Nascar, C&W;) and if we (the DWLs, liberals and RR Whites) pile on these Southerners the way which was done in the 1960s, they will move onto other high profile targets. Personally, I think the Irish and Saint Paddy are in for a rough ride. The blogosphere is full of blacks&rsquo; fear of &#8220;so many White people massing on one day&hellip;&#8221;    </p>

The Republican Party became the dominant party in the United States by default. Since 1979 after tax income for the bottom 80 percent of the United States has declined. After tax income for the richest 20 percent has increased. After tax income for the richest one percent has increased dramatically.<br>

 <br>
This is a Democrat issue. The Democrats have not been able to exploit it because most whites associate the Democrats with the defense of black interests, and blacks with crime. In addition, most whites believe the Democrats want to flood the United States with Hispanic immigrants.<br>
 <br>
Affluent Republicans want to believe that the working class whites who have become essential for Republican electoral victories share their economic concerns, and that they favor policies that will continue to benefit the rich. <br>
       <br>
For the National Review race realism is an embarrassment. Those who produce the magazine do not want to acknowledge that for Republican voters who make less than fifty thousand dollars a year with little or nothing in the way of benefits and job security life feels differently than it feels for them, and for most National Review readers. <br>
 <br>
The truth is that working class whites want a government that will protect their interests: not the interests of an increasingly predatory plutocracy, and not the interests of a dangerous and predominately black underclass.  </p>

		<p>I think Jared Taylor is being too pessimistic when he suggests in the interview that The Bell Curve could not be published today. Charles Murray remains a respected political commentator.  His articles continue to be published in publications like The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and Commentary. <br>
 <br>
Charles Murray&rsquo;s more recent book, Real Education: Four Simple Truths for Bringing American Schools Back to Reality, published in August 2008, delivers a frontal assault on liberal orthodoxy by maintaining that most Americans get more education than they are able to benefit from, and that fewer Americans should go to college. This book does not seem to have aroused any fury at all. <br>
 <br>
The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution, which is reviewed here:<br>
<a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2009/05/index.html</a> <br>
explains the evolution of racial differences that are documented in The Bell Curve. The 10,000 Year Explosion has received little of the invective that was directed against The Bell Curve when it was published in 1994. </p>

		<p><i>The Hispanics tossing off this term could easily say Anglo.</i></p>
<p>Anglo is a term of contempt, especially when used (as I commonly hear around S. California): &#8220;You Anglos&#8221;   &mdash;   followed by something derogatory.  Read on.</p>
<p>According to the wonderful site Resisting Defamation:</p>
<p><i>Anglo - This is an italicized Spanish-language epithet for diverse white Americans   &mdash;   not shorthand for the English-language ethnic name Anglo-Saxon.</i></p>
<p><i>Using this term is a claim to supremacy over, and an act of bullying, the diverse white American peoples by claiming a right to name and label them; an expression of hatred; and an attempt to smother European American diversity and nationality.</i></p>
<p>Put a stop to to these demeaning words. Anglo is as bad as &#8220;non-Hispanic White&#8221;   &mdash;   we are being defined by enemies who wish to erase any vestige of White ethnicity and culture, to render us powerless and insignificant.  This is being done on purpose and with malice.</p>
<p>More here:  <a href="https://www.resistingdefamation.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.resistingdefamation.org/</a></p>
<p>  &mdash;  also ideas as to how to attack back against White slander, stereotypes and caricatures used freely by the hypocritical media, anti-White politicians and White-hating activists, demeaning terms that would cost a White his job if he were to use same against non-Whites. </p>

<p>European ethnic heritage is OK as long it&rsquo;s non-racial. That means that you have to accept that being &#8220;Irish&#8221; -or any other European ethnic group-is something that anyone can be irrespective of physical appearance.  </p>

		<p>poster # 13-Bon..well stated..The Romans enslaved thousands of the early White inhabitants of Great Britain who were known as &#8220;Angles,&#8221; from which we derive the term &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; as a description of the English race.In the sixth century Pope Gregory the First witnessed blond-haired,blue-eyed English boys awaiting sale in a slave market in Rome.Inquiring of their origin,the Pope was told they were Angles.Gregory replied,&#8221;Non Angli, sed Angeli&#8221;(&#8220;Not Angles,but Angels&#8221;).</p>

		<p>Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;White Identity&#8221; is the alarm clock interrupting Martin Luther King&rsquo;s dream. There will still be black achievers who prefer the company of whites, and white bohemians who prefer the company of blacks. These should not face the color line which made their lives difficult in the past. Nevertheless, integration should be allowed; it should not be required. <br>
