<h1><a href="https://www.komonews.com/news/local/122063929.html">Woman Feels &#8216;Disrespected&rsquo; After Being Kicked off Train</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Sinovic, KATU-TV (Portland, Oregon), May 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lakeysha Beard of Tigard was accused of disorderly conduct after police said she got into a &#8220;verbal altercation&#8221; with train passengers on Sunday. Passengers had complained she refused to put down her cell phone. Conductors stopped the train in Salem, where police got involved.</p>
<p>Beard told KATU she was indeed talking on her phone, but said she didn&rsquo;t understand why she had to be escorted off the train.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An Amtrak official said a number of passengers complained that Beard was being disrespectful during her prolonged phone conversations on the train. Salem police reported she had been on the phone non-stop since the train pulled out of Oakland, Calif. 16 hours earlier.</p>
<p>When a passenger confronted her about her loud talking, police said Beard got aggressive. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amtrak does have a policy that riders can&rsquo;t use cell phones in designated &#8220;quiet cars,&#8221; like the one in which Beard was riding.</p>

		<p>Saw this article last week.  The fact that she was in the quiet car and &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; her fellow passengers had nothing to do with her eviction.  It is all about her.  It is always about them, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Errrr&hellip;  Could it be that it was they only way they could make you shut up, and Amtrak was terrified of a multimillion-dollar &#8220;civil rights&#8221; lawsuit when you eventually chimped out and required restraint?</p>
<p>Face it, if this obese, loudmouthed, inconsiderate, self-absorbed, ignorant slob had been <i>White</i>, this story would never even have made the local news.  It&rsquo;s only because she be a &#8220;disrespected&#8221; black that the Imperial governmedia decided the whole world needed to hear about it.<br>

		<p>Now is her name Lakeysha Beard  or did Lakeysha have a beard?</p>
<p>blacks are natural born disrupters I have even talked to people who have been in jail with them and they say blacks NEVER stop making some sort of racket, tapping loudly on tables, clicking their feet to make noise and I have been around enough blacks just in everyday life on the street, in the market and wherever thy are noise, racket, disruption is not far behind. Thomas Jefferson told us these blacks were not meant to live among us and we didn&rsquo;t listen. So at least we know enough Not to Blame Thomas..</p>

		<p>This last Sunday I heard a black man at an intersection on his cell phone one and a half blocks away.  The light changed and a city bus and 2 trucks roared through the intersection.</p>
<p>Even with the traffic noise I could still hear him loud and clear.  </p>
<p>When I walk along the side of our local post office I can hear the black workers screechiing away even though they are inside and I&rsquo;m ouside.</p>
<p>They are loud and nothing can stop them.</p>

		<p>Blacks are without question the LOUDEST people on the planet earth (when have you ever met a soft-spoken black?). They are LOUD in every possible sense of the word. New technological toys like cell phones have only added to their capacity for noise.</p>

		<p>For some stupid reason blacks seem to think we could EVER respect them in the first place. So how can we &#8220;disrespect&rsquo; them?</p>
<p>And what Matt #2 says&hellip;is very true. They are always loud, obnoxious and just downright unpleasant to be around. I leave when any are where I want to go. </p>

		<p>Does anyone know if, percentage-wise, they have more psychiatric problems like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc.  Such a huge percentage of them act so STRANGE, to say the least.  </p>

		<p>After working with the public for many years I have found that black women like &#8220;Lakeysha&#8221; are all too common. A lousy attitute along with being loud and inconsiderate are the hallmarks of their behavior. My theory is that it&rsquo;s hormonal. Black women have shorter menstrual cycles compared with women of other races(according to Phil Rushton) which means that their &#8220;time of the month&#8221; occurs with greater frequency. And moodyness is common around and during menstration.   </p>

		<p>Most blacks are unbelievably loud and show no consideration of others. They are oblivious to other people being annoyed by their inane and largely meaningless chatter. </p>
<p>It is hard to imagine new telephone technology being put to use for more meaningless and insignificant purposes. If you ever were placed in the position of overhearing one of their conversations, you know what I mean. </p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah, That&rsquo;s right, I tell you. uh huh, Awright&hellip;&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Blacks are DIFFERENT from us whites and all other races and groups. They are just WIRED differently. Their penchant for noise is just the tip of the iceberg. I also believe they have higher levels of mental illnesses too. I worked with this black woman whose voice was as loud as it was irritating. She never, ever, shut up, even though she never said anything that was interesting, profound, humourous or intelligent. I would cringe when she talked. Once she completely melted down on me. I never saw anything like it in my life&hellip;</p>

		<p>Last year, or perhaps the year before, there was a viral video of a black guy deliberately dancing into a busy street and being clobbered by an ice cream truck.  There were many comments about how blacks like to play &#8220;chicken&#8221; with authority figures or just regular folks, daring them to do something about their public misbehavior.  This story is in exactly the same vein.  Lakeysha was obviously daring the Amtrak staff to finally put their foot down, so she could win the ghetto lottery.  Any white in a position of keeping a place quiet without any real power to enforce it, knows exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

		<p>Of course she wanted to chat non-stop in the quiet car. Who wants to try to talk on the cell phone in the same car with other loud talking people with Bluetooth headgear or cell phones to their heads? It is much better to be the only one making a sound than to have to compete with even bigger mouths.</p>
<p>(I would be interested to know what phone battery will let you talk for 16 hours non-stop. Did she bring extra batteries? Are there recharging stations in the quiet cars? My phone is doing good to keep a charge for a day with no calls at all. I gotta get one of those 16 hour yak-time batteries!)<br>

		<p>My first experience with loud blacks was at the county fair. A friend and I where in the corn dog line when all of a sudden it sounded like a riot broke out. Nope, it was just 8 black girls about 12 walking and talking so loud you would have thought there was 50 of them. As other posters have stated, it&rsquo;s just babbling non-sense, nothing really worth saying and definitely not shouted.</p>

		<p>I can certainly attest to their rudeness/loudness.</p>
<p>Last week me &amp; my wife visted our daughter &amp; grandkids in Exeter township PA. On Thursday we took the kids to the Franklin institute in Philadelphia. An impressise, hands on science museum with &#8220;hands on&#8221; exhibits for curious minds&hellip;That day there were many school age children there for field trips, including MANY black kids.<br>
 <br>
The differences between the two races could not have possibly been more accutely exposed. The white children showed an insatiable curiosity for the science exhibits..The black kids?, I did not see one black child interact with ANY of the hands on exhibits. They just ran through the place just being as loud &amp; as obnoxious as humanly possible, using language that would make a drunken sailor blush!.</p>
<p>The looks of disgust on many a white face that day was palpable. The juxtaposition could NOT have been more stark..Right before we left, we went into the impressive, Roman style main atrium/cupola of the museum, there is an imposing seated statue of the great man Mr. Franklin there. There were many whites in there snapping photos, expressing an almost hushed awe and reverence. The blacks?, well, they were behaving like blacks, astonishingly rude, loud &amp; showing not a modicum of respect for anyone!.</p>

		<p>Last week, after posting my thoughts on the initial Lakeysha Beard article, I headed to the Gym.</p>
<p>I was working my Back, and was on the first of a row of five machines for that bodypart.  Just ahead of me was a seriously fine Scientist, from a distant country.  I like &#8216;em built and brainy, and watching this guy flex his magnificent Lats was some much-needed inspiration.  The music was off, the gym was almost empty, the fans were blasting cool air&hellip;just a perfect moment.</p>
<p>Then, as I finished my first set, three young Blacks plopped down, two rows over, and started yelling&hellip;apparently whatever they were screaming was side-splitting funny to them. However, I could not make out a single word of it, despite the surreal loudness. Their screeches overlapped each other, to the point that there was not so much as a millisecond&rsquo;s pause in the wave of sound coming from them.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the Lakeysha Beard article, wishing I could share a video clip of this illustrative moment with Amren Readers&hellip; and looked up to see the Scientist subtly trying to catch my eye.  He gave me this anguished look, like &#8220;Can you believe these creatures?  I can&rsquo;t take this!&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t take it either, and as much as I wanted to stay and watch Science Dude flexing, got up and went to finish in the Cybex Room, where maybe it was quieter.  I frequently have to move from room to room, and sometimes cannot find a space in that vast facility where the you-know-who are not yapping, or turning the Televisions up so loud they vibrate.  And we get the good, Church-going, NICE Blacks, who come to our gym to get away from the BAD Blacks.  One can only imagine what the others are like.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that Lakeysha may have preferred the Quiet Car, because it&rsquo;s surely where all the White People are.  Doubtless, she learned long ago, that Whites won&rsquo;t menace her as do the Hispanics and other nonwhites, who probably are to be found on the rest of the train. </p>
<p>Early in the fantastic book on the Rwandan Genocide, WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT TOMORROW WE WILL BE KILLED WITH OUR FAMILIES, the author describes the traditional way Rwandan Women have of summoning aid, while being raped&hellip;describing the way that their screams travel for long distances.  Maybe this is an evolutionary adaptation, allowing time for the implanting of the &#8216;seed&rsquo; (assuring that the most aggressive males can reproduce), but assuring that help will arrive before the Rapist has time to kill his &#8216;Love Object&rsquo;, as seems to be natural for males of a certain population, as an adjunct to the &#8216;Love Act&rsquo;.  Maybe that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so loud.  Just a half-baked theory of mine&hellip; </p>
<p>And #17, in my experience, Blacks may not need to know ANY WORDS AT ALL, to have long and satisfying phone calls.  I have wondered, for years, how they can spend so much time going &#8220;Mmmmmmuuuuuuuh&hellip;..buuuuzuuuuh&hellip;.daaaaaanghtitchaaaa&hellip;.&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve always assumed it was some sort of &#8216;Love Talk&rsquo;.  But maybe they&rsquo;re speaking in Tongues.</p>
