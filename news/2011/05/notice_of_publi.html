						<p>WASHINGTON, May 2, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/  &mdash;  Next week, on May 12, the State Department will host a public meeting on the appropriate size and scope of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for next year. This is an opportune time, then, to take a hard look at problems besetting this component of our immigration system.</p>
<p>To that end, the Center for Immigration Studies has published &#8220;Refugee Resettlement: A System Badly in Need of Review,&#8221; authored by CIS Fellow Don Barnett. He finds that our refugee resettlement system has failed refugees, both by diverting limited resources from overseas assistance and by the sheer neglect of those resettled in the United States by their &#8220;sponsors.&#8221; In addition, the program is rife with fraud, profitable for hundreds of &#8220;non-profit&#8221; organizations, and is a potential channel for terrorism into American communities.</p>
<p>The report is online at http://cis.org/refugee-system-needs-review. Among its findings:</p>
<p>* Security Matters. Meaningful background checks are difficult to obtain for refugees admitted from countries without reliable government records.</p>
<p>* U.S. Taxpayers Without Borders. The U.S. welfare system is a global magnet, which has been instrumentalized by the international refugee industry.</p>
<p>* Exploitation for Profit. Refugee resettlement is very profitable for some non-profits, who consistently refuse to commit any of their own resources for the resettlement effort.</p>
<p>* American Community Impact. Some American towns have been overwhelmed by the arrival of refugees. At no point are these communities consulted.</p>
<p>* Non-Assimilation. The USRAP is increasingly bringing in groups that have stated openly they do not intend to assimilate into American culture.</p>
<p>* Chain Immigration. The initial admission leads to exploitation of the chain immigration system.</p>
<p>* Abandonment upon Arrival. Despite PR about supporting refugees, NGOs routinely abandon their charges after four months or less, moving on to the next, more profitable, cycle of recent admissions.</p>
<p>* Globalized Disease. Refugees and those arriving on various &#8220;following-to-join&#8221; programs are bringing in HIV, hepatitis, TB, malaria, and other diseases.</p>

		<p>Rhetorical question for everyone:</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve killed OBL, and realizing that we have accepted almost 200,000 Muslim immigrants legally (and probably many more illegally, at first legally through temporary visas, but then they overstayed their visas and technically became illegals), under the pretense that extremist Muslim regimes and terrorist groups like AQ were persecuting them.  With OBL gone, we&rsquo;re told that AQ is going to fall apart.  Does this mean we can send them all back?</p>

<p>Yes, and as soon as your &#8220;views&#8221; arrive they&rsquo;re placed in a national security valut marked, &#8220;File 13.&#8221; <br>

		<p>Whoever and/or whatever continues to push this massive immigration into America must be desirous of fomenting civil war. It is ALWAYS the result of such policy. If it&rsquo;s a brain washed liberal or a neocon idiot pushing this policy then they may well be ignorant of history (although still not an excuse). My bet though, is that this is policy made by those who KNOW what the end result will be, and who desire the destruction of America.</p>

		<p>I might not have an Ivy League education like our &#8220;leaders&#8221;, but let me try to solve these puzzling dilemmas -</p>
<p> * Security Matters. Meaningful background checks are difficult to obtain for refugees admitted from countries without reliable government records.</p>
<p>So, don&rsquo;t admit them!</p>
<p>* U.S. Taxpayers Without Borders. The U.S. welfare system is a global magnet, which has been instrumentalized by the international refugee industry.</p>
<p>Make welfare available only to citizens who have paid in to the system.</p>
<p> * Exploitation for Profit. Refugee resettlement is very profitable for some non-profits, who consistently refuse to commit any of their own resources for the resettlement effort.</p>
<p>Force these organizations to support these &#8220;refugees&#8221; INDEFINITELY. When they show up to get welfare ask who brought them to this country, if they refuse, threaten them with deportation.</p>
<p>* American Community Impact. Some American towns have been overwhelmed by the arrival of refugees. At no point are these communities consulted.</p>
<p>Require a vote by the locals before any &#8220;refugees&#8221; are admitted.</p>
<p>* Non-Assimilation. The USRAP is increasingly bringing in groups that have stated openly they do not intend to assimilate into American culture.</p>
<p>Deport them IMMEDIATELY!</p>
<p>* Chain Immigration. The initial admission leads to exploitation of the chain immigration system.</p>
<p>No chain immigration allowed, everyone must apply separately.</p>
<p>* Abandonment upon Arrival. Despite PR about supporting refugees, NGOs routinely abandon their charges after four months or less, moving on to the next, more profitable, cycle of recent admissions.</p>
<p>As stated above, FORCE them to support them. Then jail\fine them $100,000 for everyone they try to dump on the taxpayers.</p>
<p> * Globalized Disease. Refugees and those arriving on various &ldquo;following-to-join&rdquo; programs are bringing in HIV, hepatitis, TB, malaria, and other diseases.</p>
<p>Deport all those found with diseases or showing up for treatment. Then jail\fine those harboring them.</p>
<p>There, all done. Next dilemma please!</p>

		<p>As Peter Brimelow once said, America cannot be the world&rsquo;s kleenex. We can&rsquo;t afford to take the increased risk of terrorism or the economic burden that most of them will no doubt place on taxpaying citizens. And with the exception of refugees from Iraq, no American, not a single one, is in any way, shape or form responsible for the plight of any of these refugees. To my knowledge, the US has never signed any treaty or agreement stipulating that it has to admit anyone. If our rulers actually cared about the &#8220;national interest,&#8221; then zero refugees from the third world would be allowed in. </p>

		<p>Our immigration policy, either dealing with refugees or not, has a life of its own. Political group think in the halls of government dictates more immigration, whether we like it or not. More of them are going to be coming it, that&rsquo;s a fact. </p>
<p>A meeting by the government - what a joke. It&rsquo;s already decided. They just want to make it look like they care about what you think. <br>

<p>The government has no intention of abandoning or lessening its refugee program because the refugee program is an integral part of the government&rsquo;s War on White Americans.</p>
<p>CIS has nicely highlighted what the government&rsquo;s primary goals are for this plan, not to &#8220;help&#8221; refugees, but to destroy White America:</p>
<p>*The U.S. welfare system as a global magnet [in order to Cloward-Piven more wealth from White American taxpayers].</p>
<p>* Refugee resettlement is very profitable</p>
<p>* Some [White] American towns have been overwhelmed</p>
<p>* Non-Assimilation. </p>
<p>* Chain Immigration. </p>
<p>* Abandonment upon Arrival. </p>
<p>*Refugees bring in HIV, hepatitis, TB, malaria, and other diseases.</p>
<p>There you have it!  </p>
<p>This is the government&rsquo;s goal, make no mistake, and it is squarely aimed at destroying White American communities, confiscating more wealth from White American taxpayers and exposing White Americans to &#8220;exotic&#8221; diseases like Brain Worm and Chagas.</p>

		<p>5 Tom S:  I think the CIS is on our side on this issue   &mdash;   Notice how their questions are loaded in our favor.  Still, you provide all the logical answers, but it seems our government has outwitted plain ole common sense.</p>
