<h1><a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/west/122446774.html">Muslim Rights Group Cries Foul Over MSP Security Drill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Walsh, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), May 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A national Muslim civil rights group is asking the head of Homeland Security to investigate the use of stereotypes after a man who appeared to be of Middle East descent was used in a recent security drill at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Monday renewed a request that Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano review &#8220;the use of outside trainers who offer hostile, stereotypical and grossly inaccurate information about Muslims and Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization has previously asked the Obama administration, the Department of Defense and Congress to provide oversight for apparent &#8220;widespread anti-Muslim bias in the training of law enforcement and security and military personnel nationwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to information released Monday by MSP airport police, the May 12 security test included a device in a shaving kit made to look like a bomb. It was a cylinder with wires connected to a wrist watch. The device was brought to a passenger security checkpoint, according to airport Police Sgt. Mark Ledbetter, one of the responding officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon arriving [at the checkpoint],&#8221; Ledbetter wrote in his report, &#8220;TSA [Transportation Security Administration] screeners were out with a male who appeared to be Middle Eastern in descent or Indian/Pakistani.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was wearing casual business attire and was calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&rsquo;s cover all the stereotypical bases,&#8221; Ibrahim Hooper, national spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Monday. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not surprising in the least that [federal authorities] would resort to anti-Muslim stereotypes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>TSA spokesman Greg Soule countered that his agency conducts &#8220;thousands of training tests each year, and the individuals carrying out the testing are [of] various ethnicities, ages and appearances, just like the traveling public.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When will somebody stand up for us when we are stereotyped for our mythical &#8220;White Privilege&#8221;.   </p>
<p>Somehow, our White Privilege doesn&rsquo;t protect us from robbery, rape, and murder, much less active and hostile anti-white bigotry and discrimination from all levels of government, religion, and education.</p>
<p>Muslims are always demanding that we &#8220;not jump to conclusions,&#8221; so isn&rsquo;t it legitimate that White Gentiles be given the same consideration?  Our White Skin isn&rsquo;t a Privilege- it&rsquo;s a liability that makes us targets for hostile and dangerously racist programs and crime. </p>

		<p>Maybe Homeland security used a middle eastern looking man in its drill because the vast, vast majority of terrorists who have attempted attacks with planes against the US fit this descpiption. All 19 of the Sept 11 hyjackers were Arab Muslim men; they were NOT eighty-two year old dementia patients in wheel chairs or white Catholic priests wearing clerical collars. If the shoe fits&hellip;  </p>

		<p>Two months after the incident in Beslan (the Russian school in North Ossetia where 380 kids were butchered), the brother in law of the man who owns the Al Jazeera television news network, wrote an oped piece in his own newspaper wherein he basically said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look you ruffians, the reason the world and the Americans in particular think we&rsquo;re -all- terrorists is because, since 1975, 90% of the terrorist incidents that have occured have had an islamic slant or participants.  Sit your young hoodlums down and talk to them or we will be permanent pariahs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did anyone listen?  No.</p>
<p>When the Muslims themselves know that there is something wrong with their reputation, the time to &#8216;intervene on behalf of misapplied stereotypes&rsquo; is -over-.</p>
<p>CAIR should realize that none of us who actually read history believe Bush&rsquo;s hooplah about &#8216;a religion of peace&rsquo; and never will.</p>
<p>3,000 people dead on 9/11 and 48,000 killed or injured since, fighting this bloody war, has basically made islam akin to social leprosy for the entire American population.</p>
<p>&#8216;No Offense&rsquo;, we just don&rsquo;t like you.</p>

		<p>Someday we&rsquo;ll get beyond complaining to each other about wild-eyed accusations against us, and begin complaining about slurs and stereotypes against us.</p>
<p>I think the problem lies in our unwillingness to rely on that old minority stand-by, &#8220;I&rsquo;m offended,&#8221; and rightfully so.  It is baby-talk and silly to claim an entirely subjective standard for a grievance.</p>
<p>It is better to verbally attack back in every venue possible, calling the remark vicious and the speaker a bully, a liar, a wannabe supremacist (for claiming the right to name the other), anti-white, white anti-white, and whatever kind of pathological flaw that comes to mind.  It appears to be the only way we&rsquo;ll make headway.</p>

		<p>&#8220;appeared to be of Middle East descent&#8221;</p>
<p>Appeared to be?  What&rsquo;s that, any White man with brown or black hair?  That&rsquo;s about 90 percent of all White men whether nordic, arab, turk, german, english whatever.</p>
<p>These stories remind me of the Princess and the Pea fairy story.<br/>
Such delicate sensititivy.  How can they bear to leave the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become a contest, who can be more delicate and sensitive and fragile?  Kind of contradicts the muslim machismo doesn&rsquo;t it?<br/>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;hostile, stereotypical and grossly inaccurate information about Muslims and Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muslims are the only ones trying to bomb us.  Muslims are the only ones suicide bombing us.  Muslims are the only ones trying to bring bombs on airplanes.  And muslims are the only ones flying airplanes into buildings.</p>
<p>How again is this stereotype grossly inaccurate?</p>
<p>And there is a bias against muslims for the reasons above.</p>
<p>They should have used Republican-looking people i.e. Whites with American flags and CCWs, then everyone would be happy.</p>
<p>If muslims don&rsquo;t want to be stereotyped in this way, than they should stop doing it.  Stereotypes are called stereotypes because they are mostly true.  If stereotypes weren&rsquo;t true at all they would call them lies.</p>

		<p>Good point, QD. Let&rsquo;s say they wanted to have a mock exercise where the targets were Timothy McVeigh types or some such group. Would the CAIR and assorted leftist enablers, or anybody indeed, question the TSA&rsquo;s use of a white male actor as the &#8220;mark&#8221;? Would they insist that a woman in a burqa should represent this alleged threat?</p>

		<p>Centuries of invasions, genocide and enslavement is the reason why most Slavs hate Islam and Muslims so passionately, they kill them every chance they get. That was why Russian troops shoot, bomb and bayonet Chechen civilians and soldiers without mercy. That was why all but one of the attackers behind the massacre of hundreds of children at Beslan was killed by angry parents with guns alongside Spetznatz troopers. That was why all of the Chechens who attacked a theater in Moscow were executed by Russian soldier by gunshots to the head, and these attackers were women. Slavs, and Greeks too suffered and died for centuries at the hands of Islam and Muslims, and many regard the only good Muslim is a Muslim dead by their hands.</p>

<p>Well, make up your mind! is it stereotypical or is it &#8220;grossly inaccurate?&#8221; it can&rsquo;t be both.</p>
