			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Kersey, SBPDL, May 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>May 10, 2011 Denver, Colorado  &mdash;  The author of the blog <em><a href="https://sbpdl.com/">Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like</a></em>, Paul Kersey, has published his second book, which is now available for purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Blackface-Black-Images-Living/dp/1460993128/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305036478&amp;sr=1-6">from Amazon.com for the price of $16.19</a>.  A Kindle version is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Blackface-Images-Living-ebook/dp/B004ZM92K8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1304950873&amp;sr=8-2">available for $7.99</a>, and the author is selling autographed copies upon request.</p>
<p>Entitled <em>Hollywood in Blackface:  Black Images in Film from Night of the Living Dead to Thor</em>, the book with over 300 pages and with a forward by <em>American Renaissance</em> contributor Gregory Hood, takes aim at Hollywood for doing all it can to ram black superiority down the throats of the American people.</p>
<p>Paul Kersey said, &#8220;In almost every film, you see a super smart and savvy Black computer wiz like in the <em>Mission:  Impossible</em> films or a technological genius as in <em>Terminator 2</em>, but the real-world doesn&rsquo;t seem to produce the same results that Hollywood continues to conjure up.&#8221; </p>
<p>May 6, 2011, was chosen for the release of <em>Hollywood in Blackface</em> so that the eye-opening book would coincide with the release of the new movie <em>Thor</em>.  In this film, the Norse god Heimdall  &mdash;  who is described as &#8220;the whitest of the gods&#8221; in <em>The Poetic Edda</em>  &mdash;  is played by Idris Elba, who is ironically and intentionally the blackest of the actors in that film.  A grassroots movement has called on people to <a href="https://boycott-thor.com/">boycott Thor</a> for mocking European culture.</p>
<p>Kersey also said that it is now as common today to cast &#8220;token&#8221; white actors like Paul Walker in <em>Fast Five</em> as it was for &#8220;token&#8221; black actors to be casted over a decade ago.  &#8220;Casting (Idris) Elba as Heimdall is like casting Brad Pitt or Christian Bale as some Zulu God,&#8221; Kersey added.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s first book, <em>SBPDL Year One</em>, has sold over 400 copies since its release and has climbed to being the #2 most-purchased book in Amazon.com&rsquo;s &#8220;Minority/African American Section.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In the theatrical world, racial casting is a big issue, but I don&rsquo;t think casting a black actor as Thor in a movie which is fantasy anyway is such a big deal.</p>
<p>I, myself, wrote a one-act play in which Babe Ruth appears as a character. I thought about the idea of a black man playing Babe Ruth and ultimately concluded that in my representation of him, Ruth was a costume character, whether in a baseball uniform or in street clothes. So he could be played by a non-white actor. But only if he wore a Babe Ruth wig LOL.</p>
<p>The play will never be produced however, not because Babe Ruth or the lead character are white men, but because the play promotes a civic theme and shows what was meant by the idea of &#8220;Americanism&#8221; in the era when that concept was current.</p>

		<p> If it&rsquo;s OK for Idris Elba to play Heimdall, a specifically White character (what other race would a Norse god be?!), then what if we start getting White actors wearing blackface to play Othello in the Shakespearean play of that name, as they used to do? Bet that idea would bring much wailing and gnashing of teeth on the Left!</p>
<p> In this, as in so many other things, what&rsquo;s sauce for the White goose, is NOT sauce for the black gander!</p>

		<p>Maybe Bristol Palin can star in the black movies?  Of course, she went to L.A  &#8220;doing charity work&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>I am ashamed of her and her MOTHER to allow her and her son to live with 2 black guys in L.A&hellip;.One she met on &#8220;Dancing With The Stars&#8221; Kyle Massey, who was also on that race mixing show. She acted so prim and proper on that show and now look at her.  Forget Sarah Palin as being even a smidgen of being pro-White! Just another race traitor. To allow her daughter and GRANDSON to do this is insane. Next Bristol will be in Africa and adopting African kids. Another Angelina and Madonna in the making.</p>

		<p>If more whites were like me, Hollywood couldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing to me that any white would be so stupid as to support these films, because they so obviously are anti-white and invariably they depict just the opposite of reality.</p>

		<p>Maybe whites of Nordic descent who are &#8220;traumatized&#8221; by the inaccurate depiction of a Norse god as a black man should set up &#8220;counseling centers&#8221; to deal with their grief. Do you think they would get a fair coverage by the MSM  &mdash;  or any coverage at all?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Why are so many people so focused on Heimdall when a JAPANESE had a much bigger role playing &ldquo;Hogun the Grimm&rdquo;, he had a much bigger part.&rdquo;<br>
I think because the average Japanese is far closer in similarities to the average white than any black. Had he been the only non-white amongst the Norse gods, I think people would still be upset, but not like they are when a black man plays a Norse god. <br>
Japanese aren&rsquo;t destroying our race, they aren&rsquo;t being forced down our throats, and they aren&rsquo;t raping and killing us at high rates.<br>

		<p>To Rap Lyrics Expert (post 6): Heimdall is a real god, &ldquo;Hogun the Grimm&rdquo; is purely fictional.  Sure <i><b>Thor</b></i> is based on a Marvel comic and not an Edda, but that is why people object.</p>

		<p>The film makers obviously don&rsquo;t know their history.</p>
<p>Before the Vikings converted to Christianity, and even long after they had stopped being called &#8220;Vikings&#8221;, the only non-white people they ever saw were Inuit and Beothuk and/or Micmac Indians.</p>
<p>Considering how their relationship with these people went, I doubt the Vikings would have envisioned any of them as a part of their pantheon.</p>

		<p>In my opinion, movies like Thor should not be supported because boycotts are the only way to get Hollywood to change its multicult ways.  I understand that young people want to go to the movies, and at least in this film there&rsquo;s a strong blonde hero.  And I feel sure that had black Idris Elba been cast as Thor instead of Heimdall, the movie would have bombed.  Young folks must be utterly numb to the token appearance of black characters and may even laugh at something as ridiculous as a black Norse god.  Anyway, it will be interesting to see how much staying power this movie has in the coming weeks.<br>
In Latin America, anti-black attitudes are openly expressed.  Black characters are usually buffoons, and criticisms are met with shrugs, even from black commentators who often state that complaints just bring more attention to the character.  <br>
Any black who slavishly supports Obama should remember this when he pushes for open borders.</p>

		<p>#1. You&rsquo;re a brainwashed fool. Besides, Thor was played by a White actor.</p>
<p>#3. Othello was a Moor. Moors are not black. White actors SHOULD play Othello.</p>

<p>It is as much a fantasy as Christianity is a fantasy.  How would you feel about a black Jesus in &#8220;King of Kings,&#8221; or a black replacing Charleton Heston in &#8220;The Ten Commandments,&#8221; or &#8220;Ben Hur.&#8221;  All Western religions can be described as mythology.  Just because you don&rsquo;t know or care about Nordic religion/mythology doesn&rsquo;t subtract from the issue.  It is even more so an issue here because Thor is a demi-god of a white, indigenous religion, whereas Christianity has always been universal.  The most popular rendering of Jesus is as a Northern European rather than the short, swarthy, middle-eastern man that DNA research has shown he would have been.</p>

		<p>Yet racist half- &#8220;black&#8221; playwright August Wilson, wrongly compared to Shakespeare and O&rsquo;Neill demanded that HIS black-centric plays be &#8220;culturally pure&#8221;, free of Whites and White influence.</p>
<p><i>Wilson  targeted the concept of &#8216;colorblind casting&rsquo; as &#8216;an aberrant idea.&rsquo; Wilson took the position that the very idea of an all-black production of `Death of a Salesman&rsquo; is &#8216;an assault on our [black] presence, an insult to our intelligence.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Agreed Mr. Wilson.  Attention Broadway and Hollywood!! We Whites want the same deal as the late Mr. Wilson:  no blacks or other non-Whites cast in our culturally iconic plays, movies or anywhere else!!  </p>
<p><i>We reject any attempt to blot us out, to reinvent history and ignore our presence&hellip;,&rsquo; &#8216;We want you to see us. We are black and beautiful. We have an honorable history in the world of men&hellip; We do not need colorblind casting; we need some theaters to develop our playwrights.</i></p>
<p>Yet you sucked up White taxpayer monies for yourself and your &#8220;African-American&#8221; Culture Center in Philadelphia (which may close without new sources of White money):</p>
<p><i>Debt, cost overruns and a shortfall in fundraising could eventually sink the sleek, ship-like August Wilson Center, Downtown.</i></p>

		<p>Expecting Hollywood films to conform to social reality is like expecting columnists E.J. Dionne or Eugene Robinson to write a non-propaganda column. </p>
<p>Like the MSM, Hollywood is overwhelmingly leftist in its &#8220;should be, could be, would be&#8221; socio-political moral posturing and myth making in its serious films - always presented as the American &#8220;norm&#8221;, of course.</p>
<p>And like the MSM, Hollywood is therefore simply another leftist propaganda noise machine consumed in their own shallow superciliousness while promoting far-left idiocy without a single serious thought to its actual consequences.   </p>

		<p>To poster #13:</p>
<p>I thought casting a white Nordic actor like Charlton Heston to play an olive brown skinned middle easter semitic character like Moses ( &#8220;Moshe&#8221; in Hebrew) was in bad taste. I see no difference in the idiocy of casting black actors to play traditional European characters vs white gentile Europeans playing Middle eastern brown skinned men - Charlton Heston as &#8220;Moses&#8221; - &#8220;Ten Commandments&#8221; and almost all the Nordic blonde blue eyed actors who have played Jesus Christ in various movies down the decades. Also, despite claims of accurate historicity Mel Gibson&rsquo;s POC (2004) potrayed a Jesus Christ who ended up looking more like an Irish Celtic Rock star from the 1980&rsquo;s ( think Dave Evans - &#8220;The Edge&#8221; lead guitarist of Irish rock band &#8220;U2&#8221;) rather than the actual dark complexioned Semite from the Bible. Its like the pot calling the kettle black!</p>
