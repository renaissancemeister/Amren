			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rich Abdill, Miami New Times, May 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Before at least seven people were injured or killed in multiple early-morning shootouts Monday, many were saying Sunday night that the scene at South Beach&rsquo;s Urban Beach Weekend didn&rsquo;t seem as bad as it had in the past.</p>
<p>The long weekend was expected to draw 300,000 visitors to South Beach this year, with clubs hosting popular hip-hop artists like Chris Brown, DJ Kahled and Rick Ross. The crowd has typically been almost exclusively African American, and Sunday night was no exception.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The weekend has been marked in past years by hundreds of arrests, mostly of black suspects, including more than 1,000 people arrested in the 2006 celebration alone.</p>
<p>But there were certainly crimes happening last night: Marijuana was pervasive and openly smoked on sidewalks, one man was spotted urinating on a Hialeah Police van and employees at a Collins-Street Subway Restaurant said customers had stolen drinks, sandwiches and about a dozen chairs from their store.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stripping and dancing in the perpetually congested traffic was also frequent  &mdash;  in addition to at least one van with transparent sides driving the streets with women dancing on poles inside, women stuck in traffic simply climbed on top of their cars and gyrated for onlookers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she got bored,&#8221; goodwill ambassador Nayheera Richard said of one traffic-dancer. &#8220;But that&rsquo;s it. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything out of the ordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these &#8220;ordinary&#8221; events, combined with Monday morning&rsquo;s gunfire that left one dead and seven  &mdash;  including three police officers  &mdash;  injured, according to the Miami Herald, have left many wondering if this was the final salvo of Urban Beach Weekend.</p>

		<p>Hmmmm&hellip;..</p>
<p>I wonder how many white officers will be sued by the NAACP for causing this?</p>
<p>Sounds like a Glock 9mm 17 round clip.  The NAACP should sue Glock for causing these shootings.  </p>
<p>Did J. Jackson or A. Sharpton have a comment?  </p>
<p>They closed Bob-lo park here in Michigan because of &#8220;youths&#8221; causing trouble.  </p>
<p>We HAD a nice ethnic festival all summer in Downtown Detroit.  Each weekend there was a different culture celebrated.  Youths forced them to move it to the burbs.  Too many whites were getting robbed and beaten while practicing diversity. </p>
<p>We have regular shootings and robberies at the local shopping mall.  I don&rsquo;t even go there anymore.   The youths ran me out&hellip;I shop WAY out in the country now. </p>
<p>This is what 400 years of oppression will do to the kings and queens of Egypt. </p>
<p>I was in Las Vegas for a business conference a few years ago.   It HAPPENED to  be at the same time as the NBA All Star game.  The &#8220;youths&#8221; tore the town to pieces.   Several shootings, fist fights in the long airport lines.  It was all over the news.  I felt like I was on safari in some 3rd world nation.  Having grown up in Detroit, I think I would be right home in South Africa.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a long hot summer!    <br>

<p>No, it won&rsquo;t be.  That would be Racist.  To cancel this glorious celebration of African-amerikan Culture would be to &#8220;disrespect&#8221; this noble and cultured people.  It will go on as always, perhaps with a more civilized-sounding change of name.  And any White businesses which close to prevent their stores from being looted will be threatened by the all-powerful NKVD  &mdash;  er, NAACP  &mdash;  with federal lawsuits.</p>

		<p> I believe that saying it was blacks responsible and not just saying &#8220;youths&#8221; could have an effect on White conciousness. By a media authority announcing it was blacks responsible, it may remove the stigma of speaking of such things in our daily conversations.<br>
 That would have helped me before I saw the light. Now I follow the light.</p>

		<p>Miami gays have demanded an end to &#8220;urban weekend&#8221; the Miami black thugfest that always results in crime, assaults, rapes, etc, the standard goings on when blacks gather whether for church or prison yard excercise.</p>
<p>Could this be a crack in the gay,black,hispanic, asian,jewish,animal lover, feminazi coalition against Whites?</p>
<p>Since Monday, more than 350,000 Gay South Florida readers have viewed Herb Sosa&rsquo;s open letter to Miami Beach Mayor Matti Herrera Bower, the Beach commission and &#8220;concerned citizens&#8221; about Urban Weekend.</p>
<p>Sosa says he&rsquo;s shocked that the blog post went viral, thanks in great part to it being a lead story on The Drudge Report.</p>
<p>&#8220;It went crazy,&#8221; Sosa said Tuesday morning. &#8220;People are pissed off. They&rsquo;re upset, What&rsquo;s the right way to take care of the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sosa, president of Unity Coalition, Miami-Dade County&rsquo;s leading Hispanic gay-rights group, said he&rsquo;s concerned some people have called him racist, after he demanded an end to Urban Weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has nothing to do with racism,&#8221; said Sosa, who lives in South Beach. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a lack of respect for the city they&rsquo;re visiting. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. This morning, there were six cars parked on my block with their mirrors ripped off, their antennas ripped off.</p>
<p>&#8220;The suggestion that this is a racist issue &hellip; is absolutely ridiculous. If anything, the city of Miami Beach as been more than accommodating to Urban Weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sosa, an activist who once was executive director of Miami Design Preservation League and the Art Deco Weekend Festival, has asked residents to attend Wednesday&rsquo;s Miami Beach Commission meeting to voice their opinions about Urban Weekend.</p>
<p>He may not be there, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not about me,&#8221; Sosa said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m going to go the commission meeting or not. &hellip; Yes, I&rsquo;m passionate about this but it&rsquo;s not my sole cause.&#8221;</p>

Miami Gay Activist Herb Sosa Wants To Do Away With &#8220;Urban&#8221; Weekend On South Beach<br>
 Author:<br>
Cindy Casares 31 May 2011   </p>
<p>Herb Sosa, president of Miami-Dade County&rsquo;s leading Hispanic gay-rights group, wrote an open letter to Miami Beach Mayor Matti Herrera Bower asking for an end to the city&rsquo;s annual Memorial Day &#8220;urban&#8221; weekend after two separate shootouts Monday morning left one person dead and several injured.</p>
<p>The annual event, earmarked for &#8220;urban&#8221; tourists, which, of course, is code for &#8220;black people&#8221;, has a reputation for attracting a hoard of poorly behaved revelers to the city. But when two separate shootings happened around 4 am Monday leaving three cops and four civilians wounded and another civilian dead, Sosa took to the internet to begin organizing citizens. He composed a letter that called for an end to the weekend, saying it had nothing to do with race and everything to do with safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not willing to wait another year to see how many more people will be killed; how many more hotel rooms will be trashed; how many more cars &amp; homes will be broken into; how many more residents need to leave in fear of hide in their homes for their safety; how much more police, fire rescue, sanitation &amp; additional security dollars need to be spent to try &amp; keep our city safe &amp; livable for all each Memorial Weekend? - a Hell of a way for Miami Beach to honor our soldiers. Every resident &amp; voter I speak to mentions Memorial/Urban Weekend as one of the top major problems our city has, when considering elections &amp; our leaders - PLEASE TAKE NOTE, make the difficult but correct decision to put an end to Urban Weekend in Miami Beach and help us SAVE OUR CITY.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I live on Ocean Drive and 15th Street. I work and live here year round have been on the beach since 1988. I have a business here and love our nightlife, parks, museums and community. Every year, I flee South Beach with my family for Urban Week and close my business for 4 days. I leave on Friday morning and return late Monday, sometimes early Tuesday morning. The disregard that this tourist group has for our community is disgusting, disheartening and sad. As a Miami Beach voter and high profile resident and business owner, I demand that Urban Week come to an end. It is not fair to me that I am forced to leave my home because for fear of violence to family.</p>

My wife and I took our brand new car to Miami on a little road trip. No one told me this event was going on. We would have left, but we could not get our deposit back. Unfortunately, the criminal thugs vandalized our car. Dents in the front and back where the Audi insignias are so you know it was purposeful. I will NEVER go back to Miami. Not sure what happpened, but it is a dirty ghetto now. Not at all what I remember as a kid.</p>

		<p>This event is three-day city sanctioned riot that the taxpayers have to clean up. Locals - Beach residents and others - shouldn&rsquo;t have to leave town or avoid the Beach for fear of their safety as most of us do. &#8220;Urban Weekend&#8221; is an embarrassment and a public nuisance to Miami residents.</p>

		<p>This so called urban weekend has become a total disaster and should become completely banned. I realize this has racial implications, but the security of the local citizens and their children has to be made top priority. Urban weekend has a significant economic influence yes, but this can be replaced with a new event&hellip;..<br>

		<p>We all know the majority RACE that is involved here. That said, there are good people in every race, just that one particular RACE (overall) behaves badly. Just look at the recent videos in fast food restaurants, or the European tourists killed, etc. What can we do about it? Time for some real punishment by the Police. Time to crack heads. If I were there, I&rsquo;d bring a weapon. Enough of these low life garbage thugs disrespecting society. There will come a point when the abiding law citizen will decide not to take it anymore and will blow there thug heads off! This is more than sad. There has to be ZERO TOLERANCE going forward. </p>

		<p>The last time I was in Miami/South Beach, my locked car (parked at a controlled lot) was broken into and everything cleaned out even as policemen on bicycles were patrolling the area. When the officers did respond, I was made to feel like a hayseed for thinking that a locked car was any safer than one left wide open. I will never return to this Third World country you lovingly refer to as South Beach again. The residents have surrendered it to the criminals. You deserve everything you get.</p>

		<p>The MOB that descends on the beach for Urban Weekend,as a mob and its attending mentality, AS A MOB are rude, crude, arrogant, slovenly and drunk. They are obviously dangerous; would you keep inviting that type of guest back into your home every year? Hey, maybe next year they&rsquo;ll burn a hotel down in our own little &#8220;Harlem Riviera&#8221;. Oh, boo hoo&hellip;I&rsquo;m a racist by that comment, right?!<br>

		<p>Okay I will say it. It&rsquo;s blacks.. not racist, just facts. if there is trouble (murders) at this type of event, cancel it. I was in Vegas during the NBA all star event. trouble and fights, shootings, all over town. they don&rsquo;t want the event back, neither does the community. </p>

		<p>Lets get real because there is no side stepping the obvious. It&rsquo;s not racism, it&rsquo;s the obvious. It&rsquo;s not profiling, it&rsquo;s minimally observing. Here in Sacramento there are 78 individuals on the most wanted list. Thirty seven of that 78 are black males. Sacramento&rsquo;s black population is 6.6%.  Blacks  commit 47 percent of the crimes in Sacramento Ca.</p>

		<p>From the chaotic reports, there were multiple shootings.The dummy driving the vehicle in the video appears to have attempted to run over a cop, who opened up, bringing the vehicle to a stop, then they opened up again with many rounds.</p>
<p>Funny, in almost every shooting in these cities, everyone interviewed by the news or taking the video is a foreigner speaking with heavy accents. In the southwest, it&rsquo;s funny watching the news teams try to get interviews near scenes as half the time no one speaks English or the crowd has a the combined education of a 2nd grader..It&rsquo;s getting difficult for news teams to find anyone to go on the air, that is capable of speaking in a coherent manner.</p>
<p>I think this is what the government wanted all along&hellip;Total chaos, all the way down to the language barriers..</p>
<p>Trashed cities, violence on parade, chaos, towers of babble..</p>

		<p>Ah &ldquo;Freaknik&rdquo;&hellip;.I had the pleasure of experiencing this &ldquo;festival&rdquo; for a number of years as my office was in the heart of Midtown Atlanta. We had to listen to the local paper and newsroom prattle on for years about how it was just a bunch of &ldquo;college kids&rdquo; having fun&hellip;.how it brought money into the economy&hellip;.and anybody oppossed to it was &ldquo;racist&rdquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t until it got so big and out of hand that they were peeing on our black mayor&rsquo;s lawn and doing sex acts on Peachtree that the tide finally turned against it. Restaurants in Midtown would literally close because their staff refused to come in&hellip;.no tips&hellip;people walking on their checks&hellip;constant complaints. People&rsquo;s weddings and other activities were ruined because the streets were gridlocked with blacks shouting racial epithets at any white who dared to be in &ldquo;their city&rdquo;&hellip;..good luck with all that South Beach.</p>

		<p>Similar problems in Rochester, New York last night from &#8220;youths.&#8221;  Inner city councilman blamed it on &#8220;gangs.&#8221;  There was no indication that gangs or any other organization was involved.  Just our usual out of control urban population acting like they do.<br>
At least one of the arrests was a 31 year old woman. Probably the chaperone.   </p>

		<p>Now tell me again how a liberal mindset isn&rsquo;t a mental illness when the media will defend &#8220;urban&#8221; get togethers or any other black gathering, with the inevitable outcomes of robbery, assaults, property damage, and shootings, but if AmRen wants to hold its annual conference, and there has never been any criminal behavior associated with their conferences, they are immediately attacked and vilified by the press?</p>
<p>Anti-white bias, racism, however the idiots of the press want to tag it, it&rsquo;s just WRONG. </p>

		<p>Anytime blacks gather in large numbers, violence and crime follow.  It&rsquo;s a proven fact, over and over and over. Blacks can scream racist and discrimination all they want over communities shutting down their events, but the bottom line is it&rsquo;s nothing but self preservation on the part of the communities and if the blacks didn&rsquo;t behave like animals it wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>

		<p>This is one of a number of similar stories fronted by Drudge Report today that all come down to out-of-control black misbehavior.</p>
<p>I think his point is to show that the MSM is lying when they report such barbaric, criminal activity as &#8220;an isolated event&#8221; or some one-off episode. He&rsquo;s showing a pattern, a common theme.</p>
<p>Many of us here have sadly known this for years. Currently, it often seems like I am living in Somalia or the Congo or some backwards, violent, illiterate tribal wasteland.</p>
<p>Again, and I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir, this destruction of America is the fault of whites who are either brainwashed or cowards or both, and who shudder at the fear the media has fed them.</p>
<p>This is white suicide by stupidity and fright. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fear of blacks, though. They are an incompetent and easily controllable group - average IQs of 85 (I suspect lower) and no impulse control or rational thought process means they are not an issue. With proper oversight and laws millions of blacks can lead separate, civilized lives with 1/20th the number of whites being in charge of all society (see: South Africa, c. 1955).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fear of a straw man named racism and of nebulous charges dreamed up by the MSM. Overcome that fear and you can save the white race and perhaps re-take America.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure we will get the same behavior from Whites who are attending a Car Show, a Business convention or the National Rhododendron growers society. If you have a reason to be in the Indianapolis area during the Black Expo, avoid downtown Indy like the plague. Except for sporting events and a few high end restaurants, you can have a great time in the doughnut counties. </p>
<p>&#8220;​Stripping and dancing in the perpetually congested traffic was also frequent   &mdash;   in addition to at least one van with transparent sides driving the streets with women dancing on poles inside, women stuck in traffic simply climbed on top of their cars and gyrated for onlookers.&#8221; </p>
<p>I was stuck behind an SUV once during the Expo and the owner had 3 flip down TV&rsquo;s inside his vehicle that were all playing porn. </p>

		<p>I`m guessing that the scene in &#8220;Clambake&#8221; with Shelley Fabrere and Elvis waterskiing was really them getting the Hell Outta Dodge via the safest and fastest route. Meanwhile. Arthur Godfrey and Jackie Gleason must be spinning in their graves&hellip;</p>

<p>I remember when Miami was mostly white, and you could go just about anywhere without fear. And that was only about 25 years ago when I was just a boy. My how things change.<br>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t just Miami or Florida, it is all over the USA!  BEFORE the dastardly &#8220;Civil&#8221; Rights Act, Brown vs Board Of Education, Immigration Act of 65, feminist movement, and desegregation,  this country was livable and for the most part, civil and safe and CLEAN! It was a WHITE America for the most part, and all I have left is my happiest memories of what America once was, and my worst nightmares have now come true, with the America we have been forced to live in now by our own government and all the traitors within and without who helped bring this about.</p>

		<p>I have always been thankful that black history month is February and MLK day is January when most of the country is in frozen winter and the southern areas are 60 degrees with cold rain.</p>
<p>Otherwise it would be murder and mayhem for 2 months.</p>

<p>&#8221; In the southwest, it&rsquo;s funny watching the news teams try to get interviews near scenes as half the time no one speaks English&#8221;</p>
<p>In southern California, I often see the news teams reduced to interviewing children under the age of 12 because they are the only English speakers in the neighborhood.  The news media was adamantly opposed to the English only proposistions passed a few years ago.  Had the schools been allowed to continue to teach Spanish speaking children in their own language the teams would have no one to interview.</p>
<p>Of course the first language fo these children is the language of their parents, various obscure pre literate indian languages.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;I guess she got bored,&rdquo; goodwill ambassador Nayheera Richard said of one traffic-dancer. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s it. I haven&rsquo;t seen anything out of the ordinary.&rdquo;</i><br>

<p>That sounds like my typical commute on the DC Beltway.  Every time I get bored in traffic, I climb on the roof of my minivan, take off my clothes and gyrate for onlookers.  My kids are always saying, &#8220;Mom, put your shirt on and get back in here!  We&rsquo;re going to be late for school!&#8221;  </p>
<p>Oh wait&hellip;no, I don&rsquo;t do that!  Weird, I almost fell for the MSM &#8220;it&rsquo;s perfectly normal&#8221; routine again.    <br>

		<p>South Beach, glamorized in the media, is actually more bizarre and amoral in reality as compared to media and movie depiction, such as the Robin Williams flick, The Bird Cage. Stoned and staggering nightlife creeps, gay prostitutes propositioning people as they eat in outdoor cafes,Wannabe Brazilian models riding motorcycles in thongs, open drug use, absurd prices for a simple beer, sky high STD rates, and on and on. Why not give the violent black thugs a piece of the action? They deserve a day. Miami Beach is the Lost City of America. As amoral as Hollywood and San Francisco, but without the class. Tourists should consider a real destination, not a community of addled phonies.</p>
