<h1>Soquel Students Suspended for White Supremacy Claims</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Azenith Smith, Central Coast News (Soquel), May 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students banned from a Central Coast school for wearing a white t-shirt. On Wednesday, Soquel High School suspended at least two students. The students say it&rsquo;s because of allegations, [that] they&rsquo;re part of a white supremacist group.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the girls wore pink, all the sports guys wore tank tops,&#8221; says Soquel High Senior Mikey Donnelly. &#8220;We were all going to wear white so that was the plan. Just wear white t-shirts to identify ourselves and look back and say that was our group of friends right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Donnelly said the school told him people were offended and intimidated by his group, claiming they&rsquo;re a white supremacist gang.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel disrespected,&#8221; says Soquel High Senior David Mine.</p>
<p>Mine also wore a white t-shirt and was also suspended. He&rsquo;s missing out on finals and that could jeopardize his graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m Asian,&#8221; says Mine. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t see how I can be a white supremacist. I&rsquo;m against it completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a pretty bad feeling to be labeled something you&rsquo;re not,&#8221; says Donnelly.</p>
<p>Donnelly said nobody&rsquo;s ever accused him of being a white supremacist before and plans on appealing the school&rsquo;s decision. He&rsquo;ll even take it to court if he needs to.</p>

		<p>Accusing whites of &#8220;racism&#8221; is just a means of paralyzing them while their country is stolen from them and totalitarianism imposed.</p>
<p>Anyone who accuses whites of &#8220;racism&#8221; has in effect declared that he himself is an evil political predator.</p>
<p>Does the desire of a people to preserve its unique and separate ethnic identity and cultural character constitute &#8220;racism&#8221;? Are the Uighurs and Tibetans &#8220;racists&#8221; because they want to end the colonization of their homelands by the Han Chinese?</p>

		<p>Ah, I see.  &#8220;White Pride&#8221; means that you&rsquo;re a white supremacist.  I am absolutely certain that no black student will ever get suspended for saying, &#8220;Black Pride&#8221; and no child of an illegal immigrant will ever get suspended for saying, &#8220;Hispanic Pride&#8221;.</p>
<p>The total hypocrisy of the entire political and media structure is sickening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even clear that any of the students even said &#8220;White Pride&#8221; outside of that interview with the reporter.  The sin was merely wearing a T-shirt with the most hated color in America   &mdash;   white.<br>

		<p>Apparently, an Asian is not even allowed to show support for white friends.  All any anti-white person has to say is that he&rsquo;s &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; with something, and it&rsquo;s banned.  Of course, whites are supposed to feel uncomfortable, to say the least.  We&rsquo;re supposed to feel so guilt-ridden over white success that we&rsquo;re willing to give up our entire society!  <br>
I wonder what would have happened if someone put a white shirt on a dog!</p>

<p>This caught my eye right off the bat&hellip;Maybe Donnelly should realize he may need us so-called &#8220;White Supremacists&#8221; one day.  He needs to wake up like most Whites need to do and realize as long as he denounces ANY White racialist he is sealing his fate of living in a &#8220;colored&#8221; world, since he doesn&rsquo;t like the other &#8220;label&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I suspect that the black students knew very well that this was not a white supremacist group. The problem is that black paranoia and low self-esteem means that if a group of white people do anything together some blacks will assume they are being left out because they are black, or are somehow being mocked and belittled for being black in a way they haven&rsquo;t understood. </p>
<p>Blacks prefer to label and describe such groups/incidents as &#8216;racist&rsquo; because to admit to themselves and others that they are simply jealous and suspicious of everything whites do would be embarrassing and humiliating for them. I&rsquo;m sure they have similar feelings just seeing groups of whites just playing frisbee together.</p>
<p>Rather than being racist, whites remain racially innocent and unaware of the effect they have on blacks. They will do insanely risky things like wearing the same colour t-shirts together, assuming no-one in their right mind could be bothered, not realising the seething resentment and suspicion they generate. Whites on the other hand could not care less if blacks were part of an all black group.</p>

		<p>This is certainly a clear demonstration of how insane PC has become in the US. The draconian school behavior/thought control has even trickled down now from Universities to grade school. Its clear that most of white America is against it, but feel they cannot say or do anything about it, due to a complicit government and the media, educational establishment, etc. spreading lies. The answer is to fight back, however you are able to, whenever you can. You still legally have rights, as these boys do, and can enforce those rights. Many an institution will back down when faced with a strong legal defense and clear evidence.</p>

		<p>It should not be a question that is asked.  And that epiphanic realization will never happen to whites until we live in an environment where those of other races -can&rsquo;t- question us.</p>
<p>Because there aren&rsquo;t any.</p>
<p>That gestaltic recombination of the existing facts is what we have to suffer through realizing before things get better.  We will be deliberately hunted and j&rsquo;accuse marginalized until it is _no longer possible_ for those who seek to persecute us to get at us.</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t happen in the present U.S..  It might happen in a followon ethnic state.  Balkanization or Extinction.  You choose.</p>

		<p>My Catholic elementary school had sports teams that played other schools, but no cheerleaders.</p>
<p>A group of us girls decided to be cheerleaders.  We decided on plain white sweatshirts and any fullish skirt we had in navy.  Everyone had a navy skirt full enough to jump around in.  We bought identical sweatshirts at the local Sears and we had a cheerleader uniform.</p>
<p>We had to take the city bus to the games though, as the nuns did not approve of cheerleaders.  </p>
<p>How racist of us.  Wonder what Abe Foxman and Time Wise would have made of the navy skirts?  Let&rsquo;s see, the Germans wore gray, green and black during WW2.  The Palestinian flag is red, black and green.  The Saudi flag is white with a green design.</p>
<p>Some people can be offended by anything.</p>
<p>I taught for a while in a horrible black school.  The 8th grade graduation featured royal blue graduation gowns.  The kids were told to wear white shirts and blouses so they would all look dressued up and uniform for the pictures.</p>
<p>The all black administration of the school must have been racist for suggesting the white shirts with the blue graduation gowns.</p>

<p>Asinine is correct! It is not mentioned where the whole thing about white supremacy came from? This was not meant to mean that but someone &#8220;thought&#8221; it was so. So that means it is so, because someone &#8220;thought&#8221; it? I guess that is what passes for brains nowadays. And the thought was in the mind of the beholder and not in the participants.</p>

		<p>Hm.  I&rsquo;m a white woman.  I tend to dress in black shirts and jeans as a personal affectation.  The exception to this are some brightly coloured Chinese dragon shirts I took a liking to just because.</p>
<p>If I need a hat, it&rsquo;s either a navy baseball cap (for fishing and stuff) or a black Stetson.</p>

		<p>The mind boggles when &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; really means only for non-whites. In the company i work for, one of the company policies is not to wear any political t-shirts of any kind no matter what side you are on. Even this is a biased rule as the blacks in the ANC in South Africa wear their ANC t-shirts with a pic of Jacob Zuma displayed and no one says a word. You dont need to be very intelligent to figure out what would happen if i wore a t-shirt displaying &#8220;AWB leader Terblanche was murdered by the ANC marxists&#8221; I would be jailed as a racist, even though i would be correct. Fact is that Chris Hani was killed on Easter weekend and so was Terblanche-figure it out its called payback even if the first leaders of the ANC terminated Hani as a threat to their greed for power. This really makes me laugh-they want to be like us but hate us? Again the mind boggles.</p>

		<p>As the man said &#8220;you can&rsquo;t fix stupid&#8221;. This is not surprising when we have &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; as a legal standard, that some bureaucrat sees a white T-shirt as a symbol of racism. In the 1950&rsquo;s, anti-communists were accused of seeing &#8220;reds under beds&#8221;. Anti-racists are beginning sound paranoid. Good, the more extreme that they sound and behave, the more they discredit themselves. Remember the wisdom of the fable of the boy who cried wolf.</p>

		<p>I think more and more that moving to the &#8220;American Redoubt&#8221; (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and eastern Washington and Oregon) is the way for whites to go.  It&rsquo;s not perfect, but non-whites don&rsquo;t yet have enough clout there and won&rsquo;t for a while.</p>

		<p>A view of the &#8216;hood this high school serves and the official edjukrat narrative of the academic profile of this high school does not suggest a place where &#8220;white racial identity awakening&#8221; would be<br>
occuring on such a level. </p>

<p>I once had a friend (early eighties) from Santa Cruz County and my impression of the place was that of a mecca for White &#8220;Kind Bud&#8221; smoking surfer slacker dudes who were very unexposed to blacks and were too busy partying to be &#8220;hatin&rsquo; on somebody&#8221;. </p>
<p>So this story is indeed interesting, and I hope someone here can provide some more insight.</p>

<p>I wish American schools had this policy!  It is worse here in S. California   &mdash;   students are allowed to freely wear T-shirts stating &#8220;Brown Power&#8221;, &#8220;Chicano Power&#8221;, &#8220;It&rsquo;s a Black Thang, You Wouldn&rsquo;t Understand&#8221;  (when actually I do understand:  It&rsquo;s about IQs of 80 struggling in a high tech world they little understand!), plus I&rsquo;m forced to look at  pictures of White enemies such as Che (looking like the banned Frito Bandito), Malcolm X (at his White-hating best), and misogynistic rap stars who call for the death of Whites, on T-shirts, backpacks, book bags and notebooks.  The murderous &#8220;Che&#8221; is all the rage at the moment.</p>
<p>And, no one says a word because the school curricula also honors these people-of-color &#8220;heroes&#8221;, along with their culture, traditions and holidays, at the expense of White culture, traditions and holidays!</p>
<p><i>You dont need to be very intelligent to figure out what would happen if i wore a t-shirt displaying &ldquo;AWB leader Terblanche was murdered by the ANC marxists&rdquo; I would be jailed as a racist, even though i would be correct.</i></p>
<p>If I were to wear a &#8220;White Power&#8221; or &#8220;Whites Rule&#8221; t-shirt or display photos of Robert E. Lee with a Confederate Flag on my roll book, display a Christmas tree or Easter Bunny in my classroom or rustle up a lesson about the efficacy and success of the Eisenhower-era &#8220;Operation Wetback&#8221; program, I may not end up in jail (not yet, but give it a few years!), but I&rsquo;d certainly be suspended (without pay), loudly labeled a Nazi and Hater, have my reputation ruined and most likely lose my state license. There is also the likely possibility that I would be physically attacked and beaten without anyone coming to my rescue and the school claiming it was my own fault for inciting a riot! </p>
<p>This is going on in all White homelands as we Whites are in the grips of state sponsored White oppression.</p>
<p>May this Reign of Terror implode in upon itself as Mr. Brimelow keeps repeating.  When, Mr. Brimelow, <i>WHEN?</i></p>

		<p>The students who wore the white T-shirts should have said that they were offended by the people that said they were offended by the white T-shirts.  Not only that!  calling the students who wore the offensive T-shirts white supremacists should not be considered offensive because they should be proud of their race just like the students who were originally offended.  For the administrator to take the word of one offended party over the word of the other offended party is extremely offensive and racist and thus he should be sued and lose his job. I hope nobody is offended by this post. Yes! this idiotic PC crap drives me crazy.       </p>

		<p>One thing that bothers me about all this is that everyone<br>
 seems to accept - without question - that being a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; (or whatever) is the most terrible thing you could be and an unpardonable crime.</p>
<p>Being pro-white has been  so demonized that it effectively has been  made into an unofficial &#8220;crime&#8221; that isn&rsquo;t even a real crime (on the books). Nonetheless, Everyone is terrified of the mere accusation&hellip; just like being called a &#8220;commie&#8221; in the 1950s, which would ruin you.</p>
<p>No one, absolutely NOBODY, stands up and says, &#8220;So what if I am?&#8221; The fact is that being a white supremacist or white racialist is NOT a crime (not yet, anyway), but I&rsquo;ll bet they don&rsquo;t know that. They find all kinds of ways to argue around it and make desperate excuses that they&rsquo;re really not evil racists and terrible  people like that. </p>
<p>But nobody says, &#8220;Yeah, I&rsquo;m pro-white! I support my own kind. So what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think more and more that moving to the &ldquo;American Redoubt&rdquo; (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and eastern Washington and Oregon) is the way for whites to go. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but non-whites don&rsquo;t yet have enough clout there and won&rsquo;t for a while.&#8221; &hellip;anonymous<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>And soon, as soon as you start to get it developed, they will be right behind you, following you whever you go    &mdash;    the blacks to collect the benefits and the browns to &#8220;do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221;.</p>
<p>And, capitalism being what it is,  there will always  be greedy businesses eager  to hire them. You can&rsquo;t keep them out without very  strict laws to do so.  But that will never be allowed in the USA&hellip; not so long as Washington has any say. Just look at the trouble Arizona is having.</p>
<p>Good luck with your daydream!</p>

		<p>The football jersey shown on #21&rsquo;s link is white.</p>
<p>The Asian guy looks half white.  Face has Europeon angularity.  Identifies with Asian though.</p>
<p>If whites could show solidarity they would all wear white every day.  Funding would suffer from absences.  Admin wouldn&rsquo;t suspend many for very long.  </p>
<p>The left has the teaching profession under its complete and absolute command and control. It will tolerate no breach of the party line, no matter how minor.  I&rsquo;ve talked to teachers who are unreachable, so thorough and severe is their indoctrination.  Even in private they will suspend disbelief and show militant obedience to their marching orders.  This absolute thought control seems to extend to the media as well.  Even Fox is always totally politically correct, without exception. There must be a way to break this iron grip, but nothing seems forthcoming at all.</p>

<p>PC is not &ldquo;insane,&rdquo; it is evil.</p>

		<p>We have to think. If it&rsquo;s like this now, what is it going to be like in the future if lunacy like this exists now?<br>
  Awakened</p>
<p> I wonder about this myself. What will happen to whites when the minorities become the majority? Will the grievances and unrelenting anti-white hostility suddenly stop? Feeble-minded Liberals say yes, but I doubt it, I really doubt it.</p>

Getting the mass of whites to understand that they live not in the Land of Freedom, but in a Cultural Marxist dictatorship, may be the first essential step. </p>
