<h1>Navy Names New Cargo Ship After Cesar Chavez, to Praise and Criticism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, May 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The newest cargo ship being built in San Diego will be named the USNS César Chávez after the late civil rights leader despite objections from a San Diego congressman.</p>
<p>Navy Secretary Ray Mabus confirmed the ship&rsquo;s name Wednesday during a visit to the NAASCO shipyard in Barrio Logan.</p>
<p>&#8220;César Chávez inspired young Americans to do what is right and what is necessary to protect our freedoms and our country,&#8221; Mabus said. &#8220;The César Chávez will sail hundreds of thousands of miles, and will bring support and assistance to thousands upon thousands of people. His example will live on in this great ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The naming drew criticism Tuesday from Rep. Duncan D. Hunter, R-El Cajon, who accused the Navy of being more interested in making a political statement than upholding its history and tradition.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this decision were about recognizing the Hispanic community&rsquo;s contribution to our nation, many other names come to mind, including Marine Corps Sgt. Rafael Peralta, who was nominated for the Medal of Honor for action in Iraq,&#8221; Hunter said. &#8220;Peralta is one of many Hispanic war heroes  &mdash;  some of whom are worthy of the same recognition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peralta, from Escondido, was killed in action in Fallujah, Iraq, and was eventually awarded the Navy Cross.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s next&hellip;naming a ship after Jane Fonda? Cesar Chavez was a communist. How much further can we fall? Our fighting ships should be named after men who did things like earn the Congressional Medal of Honor. This is an absolute travesty. Perhaps these same nut jobs are planning the USS Dennis Kucinich for our our next fighting vessel. Enough is enough.</p>

		<p>Name it after this brave marine of Hispanic ancestry who gave his life for his friends.</p>
<p>*GONSALVES, HAROLD</p>
<p>Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Born: 28 January 1926, Alameda, Calif. Accredited to: California. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as Acting Scout Sergeant with the 4th Battalion, 15th Marines, 6th Marine Division, during action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa Shima in the Ryukyu Chain, 15 April 1945. Undaunted by the powerfully organized opposition encountered on Motobu Peninsula during the fierce assault waged by his battalion against the Japanese stronghold at Mount Yaetake, Pfc. Gonsalves repeatedly braved the terrific enemy bombardment to aid his forward observation team in directing well-placed artillery fire. When his commanding officer determined to move into the front lines in order to register a more effective bombardment in the enemy&rsquo;s defensive position, he unhesitatingly advanced uphill with the officer and another Marine despite a slashing barrage of enemy mortar and rifle fire. As they reached the front and a Japanese grenade fell close within the group, instantly Pfc. Gonsalves dived on the deadly missile, absorbing the exploding charge in his own body and thereby protecting the others from serious and perhaps fatal wounds. Stouthearted and indomitable, Pfc. Gonsalves readily yielded his own chances of survival that his fellow marines might carry on the relentless battle against a fanatic enemy and his cool decision, prompt action and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice in the face of certain death reflect the highest credit upon himself and upon the U.S. Naval Service.</p>

		<p> &#8220;History and tradition&#8221;  This story brings to mind something I heard about the S.S. Lou Gerhig.  As they wallowed into the North Atlantic shipping lanes with 10,000 tons of powdered egg and T.N.T. aboard, the convoy commodore signal lamped   a message.  &#8220;Declare manifest for lane assignement&#8221;, it read. The tramp steamer`s signal bridge flashed back, &#8220;One nasty big omlette&hellip;&#8221;  </p>

		<p>I kept hearing it on conservative talk radio, and I was able to corroborate it later   &mdash;   In 1969, Cesar Chavez, Ralph Abernathy (MLK protege) and Walter Mondale jointly led a protest against illegal immigration at the California-Mexico border.  Chavez also saw to it that his brother led &#8220;Minuteman&#8221; style private patrols against illegal aliens, that actually led to the patrollers beating up the illegals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, by 1969, the definition of &#8220;legal&#8221; and &#8220;illegal&#8221; immigrant had already changed, because of the 1965 Immigration Act.  Today, Chavez&rsquo;s protege, Dolores Huerta, is as big of an open borders and amnesty talking head as one can find.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I also read that Chavez opposed illegal immigration.  Go figure.  However, he didn&rsquo;t get &#8220;young americans&#8221; to do courageous things.  He was a mexican man who rallied maexican workers to get some respect and safety regulations.  Last time I checked, there were not a lot of young &#8216;americans&rsquo; in his organization.  </p>

		<p>Hispanic-Americans are being insulted and demeaned. The Chavez will be a mere cargo ship, not a war ship. This is, in effect, stating that hispanics can only serve as servants and menials in America.  What a nation that was truly committed would do, is change the name of the carrier USS Reagan to USS Chávez, and name the new cargo ship USS Reagan. </p>

<p>Every major city in this country has a street named after him! If he needs any additional &#8220;honors,&#8221; then name a Border Patrol station after him. Seems more fitting&hellip;.</p>

<p><br>
You know, Ray, that&rsquo;s really, REALLY a stretch. You&rsquo;re grasping at straws here. You&rsquo;re just flailing. Your reasoning&rsquo;s laughable because you&rsquo;re desperately trying to rationalize irrational racial pandering. </p>
<p>So the USN is now naming ships after mestizo labor agitators. A guy whose main contribution to American society, so far as I know, was to march around with picket signs to get better wages for lettuce pickers. Which is all very nice and all   &mdash;   especially if you&rsquo;re a lettuce-picker   &mdash;   but hardly the sort of activity traditionally required to get a US Navy ship named after you. A collective farm in Venezuela, maybe, but NOT a US Navy ship. </p>
<p>Coming soon: the USNS Saul Alinsky. </p>

		<p>If they named the ship in honor of Chavez for his &#8220;contribution&#8221; to the US, that&rsquo;s one thing, but you know that&rsquo;s not why they did it. Face reality, America. Most young people who are supposed to be &#8220;inspired&#8221; by Chavez have no idea who he was, and couldn&rsquo;t care less if they did. How long do we have to play this game?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Name the ship after one of the Hispanic Medal of Honor Winners&#8221;- Just as a point of protocol, one does not &#8220;win&#8221; the Medal of Honor. That is for carnival boardwalk kewpie dolls.  It is &#8220;received&#8221; or &#8220;awarded&#8221;. I don`t know about the phraseology of &#8220;earned&#8221; but I think it is okay as it does not refer to a contest&hellip;<br>
 Off topic, but it reminds me of when I asked a handgun instructor how to know when to &#8220;brandish&#8221; the weapon. He told me to get that word out of my vocabulary in his class. He said, &#8220;Brandish means to wave about in a hostile, aggressive and dangerous manner! We &#8220;display&#8221; or &#8220;produce&#8221; the weapon&hellip;Hope this helped.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be be clear about what&rsquo;s going on here. By naming a US Navy ship the Ceasar Chavez, the Pentagon is openly appealing and promoting Hispanic racial identity&hellip;La Raza(The Race). That the Pentagon is on board with Republican-Democratic policy of race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites is obvious.</p>
<p>But keep this in mind:the Pentagons race-replacement enthusiasm is a direct consequence of Republican-Democratic policy of invading and inviting the World. If you want to seriously undermine the policy of race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority, you must oppose every Republican and Democratic invasion of other nations. Inviting the World serves two functions:1)it is a demonstration of the &#8220;noble&#8221; intentions of Republican-Democratic policy of invading and occupying  the rest of the World and 2)provides the White Liberal Greedy Cheating Class-the owners of the Republican and Democratic Parties-with an unlimited supply of nonwhite scab labor which enables the White Greedy Cheating Class to steal th wealth of millins of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>By the way, since Fox News has a Spanish speaking new service, no one here should have any doubt that Fox News is on board-100 percent-with the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority. </p>
<p>In a heartbeat, I would cut the Pentagon&rsquo;s budget by 3/4&hellip;.do this, and there will be no $$$$ to build and  name US Navy ships the USS Ceasar Chavez&hellip;the USS La Raza&hellip;and the USS Mohammad.</p>

		<p>To answer poster #15&rsquo;s question, lots of illegals are being hired to build these ships, you can take that to the bank. I have witnessed first hand how that will result in the deaths of whites due to substandard work and a total disregard for safety when one of them tried to pull a fuse out of an energized switch gear with a screwdriver. He shorted something out, and was damn lucky all he did was to nearly melt the screw driver in two, the equipment could have exploded in his face and killed him as well as started a huge electrical fire. Another one nearly electrocuted himself by sticking a steel tape measure into a 480-volt panel. I shudder to think what could happen aboard these ships built by these Hispanics who are not trained, educated or take their own safety and that of others on the job seriously. I can tell every one here that a ship can burn to the waterline in less than a minute, and they can sink even faster than that.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct. The use of the word &#8220;winner&#8221; is not appropriate. I wrote that post in haste and did not chose my words carefully enough. But I hope you got my point and that is if we are going to name a ship after someone who is Hispanic, then name it after someone who actions were extraordinarily brave. After reading the story of Harold Gonsalves, I think it or some other ship (perhaps a destroyer) should be named after him.</p>

		<p>Cesar Chavez was among the most vocal and active old-left critics of illegal immigration (as were most liberals of that era) because they knew illegal invasion suppressed wages. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he should have a ship named after him, but the humor is not lost on me reading about open borders types heralding this as a step in the right direction for honoring Hispanic Americans.  </p>

		<p>I can understand naming new ships after modern martial heroes so that we can gain some connection with the present generation of soldiers that serve.  WWII is dead to many of them and nearly all of modern civilian youth.</p>
<p>All of whom need a &#8216;See, the spirit is still alive, in your generation!&rsquo; example.</p>
<p>I cannot accept naming a ship for Chavez because his racial identity exceeded his stated goals-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&hellip;he called on _his people_ to &#8220;Make a solemn promise: to enjoy our rightful part of the riches of this land, to throw off the yoke of being considered as agricultural implements or slaves. We are free men and we demand justice.&#8221;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>And he remains so today, as a threat to the indigene white culture-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
After his death he became a major historical icon for the Latino community, and for liberals generally, symbolizing militant support for workers _and for Hispanic power_ based on grass roots organizing and his slogan &#8220;Sí, se puede&#8221; (Spanish for &#8220;Yes, it is possible&#8221; or, roughly, &#8220;Yes, it can be done&#8221;).<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot support using his name to christen a ship because-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Many parks, cultural centers, libraries, schools, and streets have been named in his honor in cities across the United States.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Note that no one in Mexico names ships after Winfield Scott who not only rid them of the despotic and cowardly Santa Anna but also restored order in Mexico city (after Santa Anna released 30,000 prisoners into their midst, with rampant looting and rioting the result).</p>
<p>Nor do they honor John A. Quitman whom they _asked to stay and take over Santa Anna&rsquo;s post_ because, hey, he got Mexico City up and running from the horrific squallor it had fallen into.</p>
<p>Why?  Because those two men, who conquered and administered Mexico _before leaving it to the Mexicans_, post Treaty Of Guadalupe, are not Mestizo.  Are not Mexican.  Your nation is your genes.</p>
<p>IMO, Chavez is not American (brother to five siblings).</p>
<p>At the time he &#8216;fought for their rights&rsquo; a huge number of the NFA/UFW were still migratory or illegal, nearly all were hispanic and the exclusivity of prejudice against outsiders in &#8216;their&rsquo; jobs has never changed.  Which is part of why Americans don&rsquo;t pick their own food.</p>
<p>Indeed, the fact that the farm worker unions have so ruined American Agro that only corporate mega farms can survive is also not mentioned.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t fight for the dominant majority of Americans and you don&rsquo;t help America, you don&rsquo;t deserve heroic privilege, as an American.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Will be a mere cargo ship, not a war ship&#8221;  In war time a cargo ship is a warship!! I apologize for being the know-it-all in class taking names on this post but&hellip; 1,554 Merchant ships were sunk by torpedo, mines and  surface or aerial attack in World War II. Thousands more were damaged, detained or captured. D.O.D. (Dear `Ol Dad) put it this way. &#8221; In the Battle of The Atlantic you had your lambs, your wolves and your sheepdogs. Your old man was a lamb.&#8221; or&hellip; &#8220;Nobody clinging to driftwood ever wanted not to  surrender&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lefties are such racists.  They don&rsquo;t actually know any Hispanics, and they don&rsquo;t know the names of any Hispanics except for Cesar Chavez. </p>
<p>Further, they can&rsquo;t imagine that any &#8220;minority&#8221; could be a military hero, or be known for anything other than agitating for the &#8220;rights&#8221; of their own group. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when, in their group-think, quota-loving minds, the Hispanics&rsquo; &#8220;turn&#8221; comes around to get something named for them (&#8220;wait, we named something for a black guy last time, it must be the Mexicans&rsquo; turn!&#8221;), Cesar Chavez is all they can come up with. </p>
<p>Actually, they probably think of Che Guevara first, and then have to be reminded that he wasn&rsquo;t an American. </p>
<p>Not to mention that it would never occur to them to name a military vessel after an actual military hero, because the military are never *their* heroes.  Jackwagons.</p>

<p>If you make any comments on foxnews.com that are even remotely contreversial, they will censor you. If you make a comment that is race related, even mild, they will censor you. You can bypass the filters for now by writing in double speak, or placing spaces within any controversial word. &#8220;White&#8221; is actually a contreversial word. That will actually trigger one of their filters. </p>
<p>The other day, I made a comment criticizing Hollywood&rsquo;s double standard. They banned a pseudo nazi at Cannes, which I agreed with, but celebrate a child rapist (Polanski). I simply stated they need to stand up for what is right, even when it&rsquo;s not convenient.  I said nothing about race, and I dutifully condemed the nazi. I was still censored!! </p>
<p>I believe Foxnews has gone the same direction as the Republican party. They have abandoned traditional American values in order to pander to the radical left. </p>

		<p>People, progress is being made. Someone actually criticized the naming of a ship after Cesar Chavez.</p>
<p>Ten or twelve years ago the only complaint would be that they were naming a lowly cargo ship after Chavez instead of an aircraft carrier or a battleship.</p>

		<p>As other people have pointed out, Ceasar Chavez was opposed to immigration. He was pro-labor. And for protesting the slave-like conditions of farm workers, he is called a communist by some people here. Well, if that&rsquo;s what a communist is, you might as well call me-Jupes- a communist. Some people here have the mindset of a slave owner. It&rsquo;s really despicable.</p>
<p>Ceaser Chavez&rsquo;s biggest mistake was his very strong opposition to the mechanization of American agriculture&hellip;this of course, had the effect of perpetuating very low wage farm work and the slave-like conditions that come with this kind of work.</p>

		<p>BamaJane, I should have had you just refer back to the article you posted. It had the appropriate terminology. But I was fascinated when I was corrected on it,  so I pass it on.  And yes, I agree 100% that their are other people more representitaive of the Navy and Marine Corps tradition&hellip; </p>

		<p>It was the Grapes Of Wrath Okies that did the HARD work under slave like (pennies on a dollar) conditions! Not the mexicans!  Call the ship &#8220;The Joads&#8221;! </p>
<p>When we were kids we ALL worked the fields yet we got no credit for it, my parents got no media attention, no accolades, they never even thought of it and most assuredly wouldn&rsquo;t approve of today&rsquo;s &#8220;poor me&#8221; we have to work the fields, etc! My parents only looked at that hard work as something simple, such as making a living for their family! Nothing more, nothing less. Had 4 brothers also that in fought WWll and Korea. Maybe name the ship after them? </p>

<p>Cesar Chavez dealt with violence as his UFW organizers often made use of strong-arm tactics against field workers in California&rsquo;s Central and Coachella Valleys.  One field organizer said he remembers seeing &#8216;loyal Chavez followers bash the heads of reluctant field laborers.&rsquo; He said the organizers &#8216;visited the fields, intimidating peasants with threats and violence.&rsquo;  Despite the public persona as a man of peace and nonviolence, Chavez did or said little to reign in the violence, which may explain why it&rsquo;s difficult to find farm workers who have anything good to say about him or the UFW.  In fact, labor leaders who lead non-UFW farm worker associations hotly dispute the notion that Chavez or the UFW ever represented their views and challenge what they see as &#8216;mythology&rsquo; surrounding Chavez.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Jupiter 7..is that how Ceasar Chavez exists in the popular mind.? No&hellip;exists as a Hispanic Power Advocate and that is why<br>
the ship was named the USS Caesar Chavez..as a sop to the<br>
Hispanic Identity folks. It is just more balkanization of the<br>
American identity. Furthermore it waas UNTHINKABLE to do<br>
this 20 years ago.</p>

<p>I agree with your post. The point that I am making is that some people who post on American Renaissance uses the term &#8220;communist&#8221; to mean any deviation from an ultra-reactionary labor policy. But it was these ultra-reactionary labor policies that were deeply rooted in Calfornia,Texas and Florida political culture that gave rise-directly-to decades of importing scab labor-and over time to a race-replacement immigration policy. It is no coincidence that these states are well on their way to being demographically nonwhite. The low wage labor policies of the Republican and Democratic Parties may very well end up being a death sentence for the Native Born White American Majority. The term &#8220;communist&#8221; is used in  way by some posters on American Renaissance  that evacuates it of all meaning.</p>

		<p><i>Most young people who are supposed to be &#8216;inspired&rsquo; by Chavez have no idea who he was, and couldn&rsquo;t care less if they did. How long do we have to play this game?</i></p>
<p>Not true.  </p>
<p>As a teacher who deals with high school level, state-issued textbooks on an daily basis and has an intimate familiarity with them, I can tell you that Cesar Chavez is shoved down the throats of school children almost every day.  Cesar Chavez permeates every facet of the K-12 indoctrination curricula!</p>
<p>Bill Clinton called Mr. Chavez &#8216;a Moses figure&rsquo; as he posthumously gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
<p>EVERY literature/history/social studies text, bar none, has  glowing accounts about <br>
social justice hero Cesar Chavez leading poor oppressed Mexicans in a &#8220;Struggle for Justice over White racism.&#8221;  He is a HERO and PATRON SAINT to the PC lefties who write today&rsquo;s textbooks! I understand math and even science textbooks have selections about Cesar Chavez as well.</p>
<p>This year, for the very first time, my school district added a new holiday  &mdash;   Cesar Chavez Day. I received a slew of &#8220;appropriate&#8221; lesson plans in the school mail to use in various ways to address ongoing social justice issues inspired by Old Cesar himself   &mdash;   which I promptly filed away   &mdash;   in the ROUND file, in the name of White Social Justice!</p>
<p>As for Cesar Chavez and illegal immigration:</p>
<p><i>When Chavez would lead a strike, the growers would send trucks across the Mexican border and load them up with scabs..Chavez offered his UFW staffers to the INS to serve as volunteer border guards to keep Mexicans from sneaking into California.  UFW  beat them as they attempted to cross.</i> </p>
<p><i>Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union he headed routinely reported suspected illegal immigrants to the INS for deportation</i></p>
<p>But later, in the 1980s, as the UFW declined into irrelevance, the aging Chavez backed mass immigration as he became a symbol of Latino identity politics.</p>

Naming a ship after a Communist is a blow to everything America stands for.</p>
<p>President Washington warned America in his farewell address about the consequences of submitting our freedoms to the corporation.</p>
<p>These corporate barons of industry have their own clans, private universities, and order, and wish nothing more than to see white mans demise.</p>
<p>They have long decided to see it through if they have to seduce you with every imaginable vice.</p>
