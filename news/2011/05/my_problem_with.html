			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Delingpole, Telegraph (London), May 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My problem with Barack Obama is that he&rsquo;s a white liberal.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ve cracked this joke at least twice before  &mdash;  once in Welcome To Obamaland and once in 365 Ways To Drive A Liberal Crazy  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s always worth repeating for at least two good reasons. 1. It&rsquo;s true. 2. It annoys the hell out of all those liberal-lefties who love to pretend that attacks on their pet president are racially motivated. As, predictably, many of them did below my last blog post O&rsquo;Bama? Oh puh-lease!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the paragraphs they found so offensive:<blockquote>Except, when he&rsquo;s in Africa, of course, when he disappears into the dry ice and re-emerges with a grass skirt and a bone through his nose and declares himself to be Mandingo, Prince of the Bloodline of the Bonga People, Drinker of Cattle Urine, Father of A Thousand Warrior Sons, Keeper of King Solomon&rsquo;s Mines, Barehanded Slayer of Lions, Undaunted Victim of the Evil Colonial British Empire.<br>
</blockquote>Is this racist? I&rsquo;d say not. I&rsquo;d call it satire. But then, one of the clever things about the term &#8220;racist&#8221; in its modern, catch-all sense is that it&rsquo;s a bit like witchcraft in the 17th century: denial just constitutes further proof of guilt. That&rsquo;s why liberals like Twitterer DCPlod  &mdash;  who branded me yesterday with the hashtag &#8220;racistpig&#8221;  &mdash;  so enjoy deploying the deadly &#8220;R&#8221; word against their ideological opponents. It enables them to play judge, jury and executioner without having to go through any of the tedium or intellectual challenge of offering their antagonists a fair trial.</p>
<p>For the record, though, I probably am a teeny bit racist. For example, I have to confess that I have a slight bias towards black conservatives and libertarians over white ones. It&rsquo;s harsh and unfair, I know. Poor Rush Limbaugh and Mark Steyn and Dennis Miller and G Gordon Liddy and PJ O&rsquo;Rourke and all the other right-wing whiteys I like are probably never going to get over the fact that I don&rsquo;t respect and admire them quite as much as I do, say, Thomas Sowell. But I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s just the way it is. Sowell is black and the fact that he is black makes him that little bit more impressive in my eyes because in order to become one of the world&rsquo;s greatest right-leaning economists and commentators he had so much more baggage to overcome. Any black person can be a liberal-leftie; indeed as we saw from voting patterns in the last US presidential election it&rsquo;s almost de rigueur. To be a black conservative, on the other hand, now that requires some cojones.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Pastor CL Bryant on fiery form in this video. As he admits in the course of his speech to a tiny audience, he could have been one of the great black contenders. After all, he had all the right credentials: 25 years ago he was radical leader of the America&rsquo;s most powerful race-based caucus groups  &mdash;  the National Association For The Advancement Of Colored People (NAACP). His rabble-rousing grievance-mongering, identity-politicking could have carried him to the top, perhaps even as high as the presidency itself. But then Bryant had a personal revelation: if he carried on playing that game he wouldn&rsquo;t really be advancing the cause of black people at all; rather he would be doing the work of their &#8220;slave masters&#8221;  &mdash;  white liberals.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s quite right, of course. I&rsquo;ll wager a good deal of money that the vast majority of those commenters who branded me with the &#8220;r&#8221; word yesterday were not black people who felt insulted by my obviously flippant pastiche version of Africa, but white liberals taking umbrage on their behalf, as white liberals so often do in it that superior, patronising way of theirs. It&rsquo;s as if they think black people are far too stupid and inarticulate and helpless to stick up for themselves, so they must therefore step in to help them and nurse them at every turn, be it through welfare handouts or affirmative action or special events directing them how best to celebrate their culture.</p>
<p>Take Black History Month: was there ever an event more patronising? &#8220;Black people&#8221; runs the subtext, &#8220;Are so dumb, so preoccupied by skin colour, so prejudiced and so hypersensitive that they cannot take their history served to them straight. It has to be adapted to their special needs. A whole month has to be put aside in order to big up a few minor-league historical players  &mdash;  not because what they achieved was necessarily that notable (if it were, they wouldn&rsquo;t be Black History, would they? They&rsquo;d just be History) but because they happened to come from the appropriate minority background.&#8221;</p>
<p>This approach is a nonsense. In fact it&rsquo;s so demeaning to black people I&rsquo;d say it qualifies as racism. It implies that they are not free-thinking individuals capable of a range of nuanced views, career options, intellectual achievements and lifestyle choices but a lumpen mass defined largely by their skin colour.</p>
<p>And this, disgracefully, is exactly the kind of game President Obama plays, and why I was inspired the other day to satirise his pathetic attempts at being the world&rsquo;s Great Race Chameleon, with his amazing ability to change his identity in accordance with the audience he&rsquo;s addressing: an Irishman for the Irish; an African for the Africans; a Muslim for the Muslims; and so on.</p>
<p>Can he really not see how much damage this does? Does he not get that this approach plays into the hands of some of the world&rsquo;s nastiest extremists: the Islamists who believe every single Muslim in the world should owe his loyalties not to his host culture but to the Umma; the white (and black) supremacists; the separatist terrorists from Ireland to the Basque country to Chechnya to Kashmir?</p>
<p>The truly great black people are not those who play the race card, as Obama so frequently does, but those who choose to forego the easy path of identity politics and strive after what is true rather than settle for what is expedient. I&rsquo;m thinking of people like the marvellous Allen West, who I hope one day will campaign for the White House, not on a ticket representing &#8220;black Americans&#8221; but simply &#8220;Americans&#8221;; and  &mdash;  on this side of the Atlantic  &mdash;  of people like Katharine Birbalsingh and Tony Sewell. And, of course, of Thomas Sowell  &mdash;  who transcended his humble beginnings to graduate magna cum laude from Harvard, not because anyone saw the colour of his skin and felt sorry for him but because he&rsquo;s a clever guy who works hard and knows how to use his brain.</p>

		<p>James Delingpole speaks a certain amount of truth, here, but he can keep his precious &#8220;black conservatives.&#8221;  Their idea of &#8220;conservatism&#8221; somehow always manages to remain race-centric, while their White counterparts are expected to put on blinders and pretend that Race Doesn&rsquo;t Exist.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s as if they think black people are far too stupid and inarticulate and helpless to stick up for themselves, so they must therefore step in to help them and nurse them at every turn, be it through welfare handouts or affirmative action or special events directing them how best to celebrate their culture.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Now, why would anyone ever think <i>that</i>, James?  Maybe because&hellip;it&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>Sorry, James, but my problem with Obongo <i>is</i> that he&rsquo;s black.  You&rsquo;re limping down the same tired, apologetic road as the liberals, it&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;re taking a more roundabout route to get there.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree.  I think it&rsquo;s an easy thing to do, because they recognize there&rsquo;s a sizable market of race pandering lamestream conservatives and neo-cons who will pave their paths with gold.  It&rsquo;s not beyond the realm of possibility that a lot of these black &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are faking it in order to receive such adulation.  </p>

		<p>I have grown suspicious of black conservatives, at least professional black conservatives (like talk show hosts or black republicans.)  They say what most whites are too afraid to say and have exploited that.  Remember when most &#8216;black republicans&rsquo; voted for Obama?  There&rsquo;s your answer.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no mind-reader but I think Delingpole is clever when he makes that quip about being racist in favor of <i>black</i> conservatives. No one could be as spot-on as he and think that. My hat is off to him for the shrewd game he&rsquo;s playing.</p>

<p>Thing of it is, sir, you are playing the race norming card too.  By using hyperbole and inciteful rhetoric -as a defense-, you avoid the _realities_ of dealing with blacks:</p>
<p>7X the violent crime rate.<br>
8X the property crime rate.<br>
52% of the U.S. homocides.<br>
36% of it&rsquo;s prison population from around 3% (black males, 18-44) of it&rsquo;s population.<br>
As much as 43% (within their own demographic of 36 million) on welfare.<br>
And an average 87IQ which I believe is actually _far lower_ than this, in the entitlement enclaves we call city centers aka urban ghettos.  Where IQ has an R=.72 correlate with achieved career satisfaction and from there, the wealth of the nation which is represented.</p>
<p>Until you abandon the &#8216;satire&rsquo; as a performance artist and start talking about the REALITIES of living with blacks, anywhere in the world, you can have no veracity of idealism with me because, in pretending not to be a racist because you like ONE MAN (this Thomas Sowell fellow), you are uplifting an entire people on the back of a single Atlas.</p>
<p>That is hateful to the rest of us who know the general character of the black from the many, not the one.</p>
<p>You are the one who needs to grow a pair.</p>

<p>QD you are correct.  I think black conservatives are much smarter.  Since there are fewer blacks, they get AA promotions even faster.  If any black had a brain and wanted to get into politics, they would go red because they will climb the ladder in half the time.  Remember Steele?</p>

		<p>Liberals believe that ALL white people are racists, including themselves if they are white.  Thus, they hate themselves and try really, really hard to emotionally self-flagellate and to advocate the tearing down of Western, white-created society  &mdash;  for which they naturally feel REALLY GUILTY for milking of every last drop of drop of privelege and perk.  Sometimes, they step into their own snare, like Ed Schultz did when he called Laura Ingraham a &#8220;right-wing slut&#8221;.  Apparently, this was construed as a sexist, anti-feminist remark, and that&rsquo;s what got Ed in trouble.  No one probably thought he meant she&rsquo;s morally loose, since to libs there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

Those Whites who &#8220;claim&#8221; they are not racist, are living in denial and have fallen for the propaganda (did you?) and want to &#8220;think&#8221; they are far superior than the rest of us.

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re a black man or woman in his or her mid-20s, recent college graduate, with political ambitions, but you&rsquo;re not really strongly ideological.  You live in a heavily black part of a major metropolitan area.  You look around   &mdash;   First, there&rsquo;s the Democrat Party   &mdash;   Almost all political figures in the black part of town are Democrats, and all Democrats in that part of town are black (for all intents and purposes).  Affirmative action is a moot point in such a group, because everyone is black.  You&rsquo;ll be waiting in line for a long time and pay a lot of dues before you truly become &#8220;somebody.&#8221;  Then you see the Republican Party.  Not much of anyone, and even fewer blacks, but it&rsquo;s the same party hooked into neo and lamer cons out in the suburbs who are covetous of a &#8220;great black Republican hope.&#8221;  You have a really short line, and you get to be &#8220;someone&#8221; in very short order.  Remember, you&rsquo;re not that ideological, and you&rsquo;re only thinking about a political career for your own self-aggrandizement.  It&rsquo;s not hard to memorize neo and lamer con talking points, then parrot them with all the fervor of an AME preacher.</p>
<p>Which line do you choose?</p>

		<p>I think the author made a valid point:  in terms of policy, Obama is indeed a white liberal.  Think blacks are better off now than they were before his election?  Not according to unemployment, food stamp, welfare and prison statistics.  Electing Obama did no single good thing for blacks in America.  They weren&rsquo;t any better off under Clinton, either.  White liberals never help blacks, they simply take their side in their hissy fits.  White liberals, not blacks, are the reason why the race card works.  White liberals have always been the enforcement arm of black indignation, otherwise who&rsquo;d care?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what Obama&rsquo;s policies are: an enforcement of white liberal politically correct racial thinking.  To wit, blacks can languish in their poverty and ignorance and turmoil all they want, and loot and kill and rob and rape all they can get away with, but if any person says anything negative about it, they will be banished from polite society.  It&rsquo;s the trade-off white liberals offer blacks in exchange for votes:  you can live that way, and we&rsquo;ll stop &#8220;racists&#8221; from pointing it out publicly.  Diversity!</p>
<p>Obama follows the script as perfectly as if he wrote it.  In that sense, I think Delingpole is very shrewd in his assessment.</p>

		<p>14:  I really don&rsquo;t consider Colin Powell to be a &#8220;traitor,&#8221; because I never considered him trustworthy to begin with.  The only kind of person who would consider him a &#8220;traitor&#8221; for having endorsed Obama over McCain is the kind of race pandering neo or lamer con Republican who invested so much (&#8220;great black&#8221;) hope in him to begin with.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear until 1996 that he was actually a Republican, and even when he did say he was one, he then followed with policy pronouncements that were three-fourths liberal, and most of the non-liberal positions were Kempite neo-liberal ideas.</p>

		<p>It is hard to discern what the actual salient biographical facts of life are for the President.  There is a troubling amount of<br>
&#8220;information&#8221; that exists mainly upon the strength of having gotten into print and having been accordingly reprinted over and over.  There is also a shortage of persons having interacted with him during his formative years that appear willing to speak out on their own or to be interviewed (other than appropriately by the Secret Service ) As far as I can sense, there is scant evidence that race was ever an important part of his day to day interactions with people.  The single exception, of course, was his smothering mother and her obsessions about race as part of her get-a-life commitment to neo-Marxism, herself having grown up with almost no contact with persons of a race other than her own  &mdash;  i.e., American mid-western whites with whom she had little social success.    </p>

		<p>I had to laugh when some posters said Blacks are always liberals. They could not be more wrong. Just because Blacks go along with some liberal Whites is only because they have a common goal. THE destruction of a White dominated society. Only Whites are liberals in this world. No other group is. This is ok if we are among ourselves however until that day, it is disaster for our people. Also so-called conservatives are our greatest enemies. Whites stop worrying about their dispossession during their administrations. Like the race traitor Reagan.if this site is indeed for Conservatives let me know because I am out of here pronto.<br>

		<p>When blacks usually vote 90 percent Democrat and then vote 96 percent Democrat when a black man is running for president, then logically there are alot of fake black conservatives in the Republican Party who are in there to promote their careers because there&rsquo;s just too many blacks on the liberal side to get ahead.  Some of them have even come out in the media and said they voted for Obama. Are they going to be against affirmative action?  Of course not.  That&rsquo;s how they got their jobs in the first place.   </p>
