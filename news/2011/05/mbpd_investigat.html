			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WMBF News (Myrtle Beach), May 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>During this busy Memorial Day weekend on the Grand Strand, police have seen a number of crime reports coming in.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 3:00 a.m. Saturday, police were told that a man was robbed at gun point on 11th Avenue South past Oak Street. Two Black males with semi-automatic pistols were reported to have held up a man, taking $40 and jewelry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 4:25 a.m. Sunday, authorities arrived to the scene of 3201 North Kings Highway in Myrtle Beach where a woman reported that she and her three male friends were robbed and carjacked at gunpoint behind the Bargain Beachwear by four Black males. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 4:30 a.m. Sunday, a man and his wife were riding back to their motel when they stopped at a stop sign and were allegedly assaulted and robbed on Yaupon Avenue between 13th and 17th Avenue South.  The man reported being stabbed in his side and his necklace taken.  EMS was called when he returned to the motel.  No suspect could be identified due to the large number of people around at the time.</p>
<p>Myrtle Beach Police are also investigating two people in area hospitals that came in with gunshot wounds.  A person treated at Grand Strand Regional and a patient at Waccamaw Hospital both reported being injured in the area of 9th Avenue and Ocean Boulevard.  Neither person knew the other, nor did they know who fired the shot or why. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 9:30 p.m. Sunday, three people coming out of the Bar Harbor Motel in Myrtle Beach notified police that they were robbed at gunpoint by three black males.  The victims told police the subjects were in one of the rooms. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> sBetween 2:30 and 3 a.m. Monday, Myrtle Beach Police responded to an armed robbery call on Yaupon Drive between 12th and 13th Avenue South.  The victim claims he and his friend were robbed at gunpoint by two black males wearing all black clothing with bandanas over their faces.  Approximately $40 and jewelry was reportedly taken. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At around 4 a.m. Monday at the beach access of 26th Avenue South, people told police they were robbed at gunpoint by two black males, who took money and jewelry and took off on foot.  No further description was given besides one wearing a white shirt, and one was wearing a black shirt.</p>
<p>Just before 4:30 Monday morning, a taxi driver for Beachside Cab said he was sleeping in his van at the Greyhound bus station on 7th Avenue North when two subjects hit him and demanded money.  They then allegedly pointed a handgun at the taxi driver and threatened him. The victim gave the subjects over $300 before being hit again. </p>
<p>The victim describes the first subject as a 6 foot very thin black male with tight corn rows, no facial hair and a pointy face.  He was said to be wearing a baggy white t-shirt and faded black denim jeans. The second subject was said to be a similar build wearing a green shirt.  The two subjects were last seen leaving on foot eastbound towards Kings Highway.</p>

		<p>Well imagine that.  Black crime. I&rsquo;m much more surpised at the honest reports given regarding the suspects&rsquo; descriptions.  Usually we are just told about the ever present &#8220;group of youths,&#8221; or &#8220;unidentified males&#8221; wearing &#8220;baggy pants, etc&#8221;.  We all know what&rsquo;s what anyway, regardless of the silly, nebulous attempts to minimize the impact of the great shock we would otherwise experience upon the disclosure that the perpetrators were black.</p>

		<p>Big Crowds = Big Herd, ripe for urban &#8216;youth&rsquo; to come and go among as they please.  Taking several victims and then disappearing like lions into the tall masses, with enough money to last for maybe a week.</p>
<p>And nobody dares say or do a thing because the obvious profiling cue would be &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to carry on a hot Memorial Day, not least because it shows and people will look at you like you&rsquo;re nuts while the obvious &#8216;bystanders nailed by stray rounds&rsquo; risk makes it even less palateable.</p>
<p>But the alternative is simply to avoid the studied attention of predators who will increasingly exploit situations like this, like lions on a game trail, by not partaking of large street crowd events.</p>
<p>Remember the 50s?  Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed -near- a white beach or on the boardwalk and crime was near ZERO as a result.</p>
<p>We could have those days again.  In our own nation.</p>
<p>7X the violent crime.<br>
8X the property crime.<br>
36% of the prison population.<br>
3% of the total population (black males, 18-44).</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t all this a given when blacks are around? We have seen it time and again and again. When will we finally wake up as a race and demand they all leave America? We have given these thugs way too much as it is and they OWE us! Now let us collect!</p>

<p>This reminded me of a story on A&E; where black youth (already in gangs, BTW) were joining the navy, &#8220;taking over&#8221; certain ships and stealing weapons to use in crimes once they finished their tour of duty. I was doubly surprised that this episode was aired during the latter half of the PC Clinton Administration. </p>

		<p>Every single day I read reports on AmRen, Drudge, etc. on verifiable crimes of extreme violence and inhumanity.</p>
<p>99% of the time I can see the criminals black face, even before I get to the words kids, or youths.</p>
<p>None of this ever appears in our local paper or TV reporting.</p>
<p>Even the horrific rape, torture and murder of those kids in Knoxville was Never Reported in our local news. Had it been a black who had his toe stepped on accidentally we would see be reading about our White Racism six months later.<br>
Thomas Jefferson warned us but we didn&rsquo;t listen, now we have the piper to pay. blacks are going to continue to get worse and worse in America and I say that based on every place they have ever been. They close Malls and Stores yet Many Liberal Whites will still call you a murderer? child molester? thief? No, much worse (&#8220;a racist&#8221;) if you verbalize the truth.</p>
<p>They need to change the dictionary to express the meaning of racism today..<br>
RACISM anything negative no matter how true or verifiable said about Any Minority but blacks in particular.<br>

		<p>Anon #5, you need to fire off an email to Myrtle Beach Chamber of Commerce and tell them exactly that.</p>
<p>And if I had a tourist related business anywhere near the attractions, I&rsquo;d close during black bike week regardless. Let them sue. It would take forever and a day.</p>

		<p>Blacks also look stupid and out of place on motorcycles. &#8220;black bike week&#8221;&hellip;what a farce&hellip;</p>
<p>The same with convertibles and cowboy hats and boots. The same thing goes for Mexicans. This is one of my biggest pet peeves and all that I named is strictly a WHITE thing and only Whites can pull it off and look good.</p>
<p>Blacks and mexicans NEVER look right riding or wearing any of the above mentioned.</p>

		<p>That article has changed.  I don&rsquo;t know which iteration of it I came across (via Drudge), but it differs from the current version in two important ways.</p>
<p>1. The first crime it outlined did NOT specify the race of the perpetrators, but eventually the author got tired of being politically correct - perhaps realizing the absurdity of describing suspects by clothing description only.</p>
<p>2. It talked about a white woman being raped by blacks.  It then said a white man pointed a shotgun at the blacks who ran off.  In the same paragraph it said something about a security guard having a weapon leveled at him.  It was very poorly written and did not say who did this&hellip;.or why.</p>
<p>I would like to know if the rape occurred, and if it did, why it was scrubbed.</p>
