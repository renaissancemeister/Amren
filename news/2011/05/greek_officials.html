<h1>Greek Officials Urge Calm After Racist Attacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Paphitis, Seattle Times, May 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Government officials appealed for calm Friday after three days of attacks by ultranationalist mobs on dark-skinned foreigners in Athens, sparked by the fatal mugging of a Greek man in the capital&rsquo;s crime-infested center.</p>
<p>The public order minister, Christos Papoutsis, said there was a &#8220;very high risk of hate crimes&#8221; amid rising social tension, and promised future action to address inner-city crime.</p>
<p>Greece is in the throes of a major financial crisis. It is also the main gateway to the European Union for tens of thousands of illegal migrants from Asia and Africa that have transformed the capital&rsquo;s ethnic makeup by moving into depressed central neighborhoods. The influx has helped fuel a nationalist backlash that reached a climax this week.</p>
<p>Greece&rsquo;s Pakistani community says more than 100 Asian and African immigrants were attacked Thursday by rampaging youths protesting the mugging, in a march organised by residents of the center that was quickly taken over by ultranationalists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several hundred youths, dressed in black and some wielding bats, were involved in the daytime violence, chasing immigrants through narrow streets before punching and kicking them to the ground.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There were racist attacks before, but Thursday&rsquo;s events were something else, really terrifying,&#8221; Mohammad said. &#8220;It all happened very suddenly, we didn&rsquo;t expect something that extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The police were everywhere, but neither did they offer us protection nor did they stop those who were attacking us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have a wife and three children. Should I leave Greece, or stay and maybe get killed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, you should leave! Go back to wherever you came from and tell your kinfolk to stay home too! </p>
<p>Please stop trying to come to our Western nations, ruin our cultures, change our way of living, steal jobs from our kids and take money that doesn&rsquo;t belong to you from our social programmes and benefits agencies! </p>
<p>Just stay away! </p>

		<p>The circumstances of the &#8220;fatal mugging&#8221; were especially odious, and accordingly this slanted MSM account needs to be supplemented with those gory facts.  A young native Greek father was walking on his way to a maternity hospital to video-record the birth of his child when he was set upon in the street by two North African &#8220;immigrants&#8221; who robbed him of his camera and stabbed the poor man to death into the bargain. Concerned by his tardiness, his family members went looking for him, and discovered his bloody corpse on the sidewalk.  The native people of Greece were already sick about how treasonous Euro-elites have allowed uncontrolled immigration to turn Athens in a seething Third World ghetto, but that vile &#8220;mugging&#8221; was obviously the last straw. And I can&rsquo;t find it in my heart to utter one world of condemnation for them.</p>

		<p>Dear &#8220;Mohammad&#8221; Who Is Mentioned In The Article: Indeed, GO HOME! You do not belong in Greece, you were not invited to Greece by The People, and you are not welcome in Greece. If you decide to inflict yourself on the people of Greece during this time of strained budgets, massive unemployment, and rising anger then you should not be surprised by what happens to you. I repeat, GO HOME to your multiple children and wife. I might add that the unemployed and rationed Greeks cannot themselves afford such luxuries as large families any longer. Your theft of Greek resources to enlarge your backwards brood will not be taken kindly by the populace of Athens. As one with compassion I say again, GO HOME. If you don&rsquo;t then don&rsquo;t be surprised when Greeks commit violence upon you. Personally, I do not condone violence, but I do understand it. This can be avoided easily. Once more, GO HOME. </p>

		<p>Good for the Greeks.  I saw a picture of refugees from Libya on the Italian island of Lampadeusa in the NYTimes recently.  More than 70 young men.  Only 3 looked like Arabs.  The rest were all black africans.  If things are so bad in Libya why don&rsquo;t they go back to that wonderful cradle of civilization?</p>

		<p>See how they refer to &#8220;Greece&rsquo;s Pakistani community&#8221; completely deadpan, as if no further explanation were necessary, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for a tiny country in Europe to have a &#8220;Pakistani community.&#8221; </p>
<p>And they say the mainstream media doesn&rsquo;t have a liberal bias. Look at the assumptions they make without even being aware of it.</p>

		<p>After reading the excellent article &#8220;The Battle For Athens&#8221; at Alternative Right, this is EXACTLY the kind of headline I would expect from an MSM source.</p>
<p>Of course, they neglect to mention the fact that the trouble erupted last Tuesday morning, when a 44-year-old Greek man, Manolis Kantaris, was killed by three Mahgrebs (Morrocan or Algerian according to the police), as they tried to rob him of a video camera he was carrying. The most shocking part, and that which infuriated Greek citizenry, was the fact that the victim carried the video camera because he was going to take his wife to the hospital where she was to give birth to their second child. </p>

<p>Sounds like the Greeks are rediscovering that they are Greek. They&rsquo;re relearning who they are   &mdash;   and who they aren&rsquo;t   &mdash;   and why that difference matters. Good for them!</p>
<p>Now if only white Americans could rediscover they are white Americans&hellip; </p>

		<p>Mohammed seems a little slow as he doesn&rsquo;t understand that the Greeks want him to leave. At the least the Greek police are quicker on the uptake and understand that the tax-paying Greeks who pay their salaries don&rsquo;t want them to protect the intruders. If the police can make this obvious deduction, it is strange that the Greek members of government, who rule the country where Aristotle established rules of logic, cannot make a similar deduction. </p>
<p>It is unfortunate in the extreme that the Greek patriots driving out the barbarian intruders find it necessary to wear masks. The Spartans at Thermopylae, the Thebans and Athenians at Plataea, and the Greeks at Marathon did not need to wear masks. </p>

		<p>Good for the Greeks.  If only other Westerners would have the courage and pride to do the same.  Unlike a previous poster I do condone violence if that is what it takes to stop the infestation of dusky Third Worlders polluting our nations.  Manolis Kantaris was simply the latest in a long line of victims that the treasonous left should be held directly responsible for.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>What is this nonsense  about  &#8220;Greece&rsquo;s Pakistani community&#8221;? </p>
<p>And Athens&rsquo; &#8220;crime-infested center&#8221;?</p>
<p>I was last in Athens about 10-12  years ago and walked everywhere<br>
 without fear of being bothered.   In that short a span it has been transformed! </p>
<p>There was no African-Asian community and rampant &#8220;minority&#8221; crime.  Now it seems to have become another third world hellhole. (As is always predictable wherever they go.)    No wonder the Greeks are outraged. I can&rsquo;t blame them.   It doesn&rsquo;t take long for civilization to be trampled under.</p>
<p>And, just the same as here and EVERYWHERE, their own  government does nothing to protect  them. It is much more concerned about protecting the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and preventing &#8220;hate&#8221; crimes against them. If you get murdered by an &#8220;immigrant&#8221;&hellip; well, tut tut. That&rsquo;s a shame.  But lashing back will NOT  be tolerated! That would be a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, the worst possible thing.</p>
<p>And the immigration will continue.</p>
<p>Can it be any more obvious that this is an organized, INTERNATIONAL movement that is directed against ALL  white countries?</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Oh, yes, and are murders now referred to,  casually, as merely &#8220;fatal muggings&#8221;?   Heavens! We don&rsquo;t want to insult  the immigrants, do we?   It wouldn&rsquo;t be nice to call them murderers. Somebody might take offense.  Mustn&rsquo;t have THAT!</p>

		<p>It made my day to hear that Greeks citizens are attacking these hostiles and making it clear to them that they must leave, or die. They invade a country where the native population is already under duress from a government who is starving them out, and attack people. Why shouldn&rsquo;t Greeks react with violence? These invaders are also doing what amounts to taking food out of Greek children&rsquo;s mouths. Moreover, I think this is going to spread to all formerly white nations, and here in the U.S., a lot of these illegals are going to find out they are not the only ones with guns and who know how to use them in co-ordinated attacks.</p>

		<p>NOTE THE PHRASING HERE</p>
<p>THOUGHT POLICE REMIND YOU: Correlation - &#8216;major increase in migrant numbers&rsquo; - does NOT equal Causation - &#8216;worsening crime rates&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You betcha. It&rsquo;s just an unfortunate coincidence that those 2 trends emerged in the same place at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past few years, the capital&rsquo;s center has seen a major increase in migrant numbers, which, combined with worsening crime rates, has prompted a far-right backlash.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Despite the disasters wrought on the UK, France, Netherlands etc, the Greek political class were determined to show north Europeans how &#8216;clever&rsquo; and &#8216;progressive&rsquo; they were by importing dark people all of their own.Like other policies pursued by Greek elitists it ended in catastrophe.<br>
  Mass third world immigration into Greece is still a recent phenomenom, so the Greeks still have the blessing of time to deal with it.The only remedy is an unforgiving, pitiless policy of repatriation combined with a cast-iron moratorium on all further immigration.Anything less will see the Greeks overrun just like France or England.<br>
  Rest assured, the Greeks won&rsquo;t have the brains or guts to do this, and they will be overrun.The Greek financial meltdown is a mere sideshow to the ramifications of the immigration disaster.</p>

		<p>I prefer the term &#8220;Hajjis&#8221;, to refer to these N. African undesirables. I thought the Arab Spring of change that swept through N. Africa was going to bring about positive change and make those 3rd world nations more livable. Even in a Western country that is going through a brutal economy, it&rsquo;s far better than Algeria or Morocco. But it&rsquo;s not Western civilization&rsquo;s responsibility to better the lives of 3rd worlders. It&rsquo;s the leaders of these indigenous dumping grounds to make changes to keep people there, and then tax them, take away their high earning jobs, distress the school systems, and expect to get their votes. Wait a minute! That is the current status of democracy.</p>

		<p>  Average Greeks resent their displacement by African and Muslim outsiders. It has been EU and Greek Government policy to &#8220;enrich&#8221; Greece, a small country with high unemployment among indigenous Greeks, with an endless stream of &#8220;asylum&#8221; seekers. Most of these immigrants are economic migrants seeking a better standard of living at Greek expense  &mdash;  they have no interest in Greek culture or history. </p>

		<p>Greece is being invaded (along with a good many other countries) by Third Worlders. Men and women who love their own country are likely to resist invasion, even if their government and elites are unwilling to take any action. Either Western Civilization will be preserved or it will be annexed to the Third World.</p>
<p>There is no place to run and no place to hide. Either we stay here alive or we stay here dead. Let the invader be inconvenienced by having to return to his own homeland.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Third World misunderstands that OUR country is FREE and that does not mean&hellip;..FREE FOR THE TAKING.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s  interesting to see the tone of approach, taken by  both the press and the authorities.</p>
<p>They are less  concerned about swarms of criminal aliens in their midst, but far more concerned about preventing &#8220;racist&#8221; attack&#8221; against  the poor refugees.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Pakistani community&#8221; must think that Greece is free for the taking. </p>
<p>Mohammed only seems to care about himself, but doesn&rsquo;t even seem to notice that a Greek father of two was murdered, nor does he like it that Greeks would value themselves over foreigners, he must believe that liberal media garbage about &#8221; enriching diversity &#8221; but only sees it one way: white Greeks are &#8220;multiculti poor&#8221; and he is supplying the &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here is an idea: how safe and tolerant is Pakistan? That country needs some White Colonial &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. So does Turkey,  American and Canadian Whites abandoning the sinking U.S.S. AMERICA to escape the hordes of immigrants, demand to be tolerated in Turkey and Pakistan, and northern Africa; as you build little Italy-America, little German-America, little English-America, etc. In segregated towns and streets named after states and historical figures. If &#8220;diversity&#8221; becomes a two way street, all multiculturalism will fall. </p>

		<p>I admire the Greeks. If a foreigner raped and murdered an ethnic Swede or German, what do you think other ethnic Swedes or Germans would do?  Absolutely nothing.   Northern Europe lets their foreigners rape and murder with virtual impunity&hellip;.no protests, no retaliation, and no sigficant punishment. </p>
<p>The government and liberals would actually rally for the foreign rapist or murderer. Anyone who even verbally protests would be legally attacked by government bullies. It&rsquo;s actually a crime to tell the truth. I don&rsquo;t think this is news to anyone on amren. I&rsquo;m thouroughly horrified and I&rsquo;m venting. The U.S. has similar policies, but not as bad. Fox news actually heavily censors their posts. I would not be able to post this on FNC without writing in double speak. I thought they were on our side.</p>

		<p>Comparative Areas</p>
<p>Alaska: 662,000 square miles.<br>
Pakistan: 308,000 square miles.<br>
Texas: 269,000 square miles.</p>
<p>Comparative Populations</p>
<p>Alaska: 710,000 residents.<br>
Pakistan: 170 million natives.<br>
Texas: 25 million residents.</p>
<p>&#8216;Knowing the demographics&rsquo;.  Which State is closer to Pakistan?  Both in terms of climate, available resources, crime and likely trends of population vs. civilized culture.</p>
<p>Now look at Greece.</p>
<p>Area:  51,000 square miles<br>
Population: 11 million.<br>
Extractions: 94% Greek, 4% Albanian, 2% Other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s closest U.S. equivalents in total area are Louisiana and Mississippi.  Both of roughly 3-5 million population.</p>
<p>After 5,000 years (known history) of being the worlds shortcut to Europe across the Bosporus, these people are lucky they have any genetic or cultural identity left at all.</p>
<p>But they do!</p>
<p>And are rightfully proud of it.</p>
<p>And they _have to_ be exceptionally protective of what they have.  Or they could lose it all.</p>
<p>Pakistan, in a similar geographic condition, has no culture, every town is it&rsquo;s own tribal enclave.  Being the gateway to India and hence the route-around the Himalayas for every invasion from Aryans to Alexander to Mohammed and Tamarlane, it has long since given in to it&rsquo;s own plundering.</p>
<p>And they gave up the fight to be their own people, long ago.</p>
<p>How do I know?  Because 170 million people in that (relatively) small a land space ONLY happens as a function of reproductive warfare between tribal primitives, each seeking to maximize their ethnic foothold strengths as an insurance policy in case of attempted annihilative genocide.</p>
<p>And it happens utterly instinctively, without consciousness of either immediately available or absolute ceiling (if we take everything) resource constraints.</p>
<p>It is the behavior of the stupid.</p>
<p>Hence Pakistan has 170,000,000 people and atomic bombs yet has no civil infrastructure worth mentioning and is generally a hole of a country.</p>
<p>And they fail to realize that the REASON they have nothing is because they have no &#8216;conception&rsquo; of the reasons for population control by ethnicity, religion and race.</p>
<p>So that at least -someone- lives well.</p>
<p>You see the same pattern in previously fairly sophisticated cultures overrun by racial and religious barbarism, the world over.</p>
<p>India herself for instance, despite her caste system is one giant squllor of no one having the determinative population demography to say NO, _the land_ belongs to OUR genetic future.  Not yours.</p>
<p>Hence they breed in competition with each other.  And so by 2060 there will be 1.52 BILLION-with-a-B Indians.  All wanting to come here.  To our debt broken but open spaces.</p>
<p>Avoiding this Malthusian calamity is, more than anything else, what made Europe and particularly America successful.  Low population overburden = many high class jobs and economic plenty for all.</p>
<p>Pakistanis have an average IQ of 84 and so have an excuse for their ignorance in the face of the evidence of their own, blatantly impoverished, condition.</p>
<p>At 100+ IQ, we do not.</p>
<p>For Pakistan is but one of multiple living cultural anachronisms (i.e. social evolutionary dead ends) from around the planet. Yet still we persist in making our &#8216;post racial, all are equal&rsquo; society _just like theirs_.  As the next gateway for the downtrodden masses to trample a native, successful, beautiful culture into oblivion with their own needy, greedy, instinct driven _cultural failure_.</p>
<p>And no one with a 120+ IQ will explain why.</p>
<p>Why we are making decisions that do not take account of what happens when there is so many &#8216;equals&rsquo; that we are _all_, universally and equally, poor.</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/KK8SV</p>
<p>Remember it well, for with modern globalist economics supporting utterly unnecessary and easily stoppable migratory population movements from the poorest lands to the richest, &#8216;one day, this too, once will have been yours&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m kidding?  Soylent Green came out in 1973.</p>
<p>This is the new version of &#8216;virtual environmentalism&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The Greeks struggled for centuries to shake off Turkish occupation and finally, in just this past century, disentangled themselves from the Turks. They finally had their own country for themselves.</p>
<p>Now, having  at last rid themselves of that plague of  Moslem Turks,  they are importing Moslem  Pakistanis instead!</p>
<p>(Personally, I think they would have been better off with the Turks, who are at least more like them.)</p>
<p>Not that the Greek people want this racial change.  They don&rsquo;t!  But the ruling elites in Athens and Brussels do. Generally, the ruling elites pay no attention to the masses.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>South Asia (India &amp; Pakistan), as well as Africa, were getting set for this Malthusian calamity, which is Nature&rsquo;s harsh solution when nobody has the sense to control their own unlimited breeding (the Chinese have shown some sense).  If you do not  control your numbers, Nature will.  And she will not be kind. Nature is indifferent to human suffering.</p>
<p>But these overpopulated places have found an escape hatch to this terrible soljution by exporting their excess millions to America and Europe. Let us take the burden off their shoulders!</p>
<p>By this strategy, they defer/delay the inevitable Malthusian solution by another century or two.  By that time, we will have to suffer it along with them.</p>

		<p>In a way this reminds me of China and the &#8220;African Universities&#8221; that were located in several places in Beijing.  The black students were housed, fed and cared for in hopes of making Africa communist.  One little problem, Africans were not above stealing from, raping, and killing their hosts.  Finally after one particular heinous beating and rape, riots broke out with the Chinese citizens attacking the blacks.  This went on for a couple of days when the police allowed the citizens to storm the universities with the intent on beating them through the streets towards the airport.  That is what happened, the police allowed tens of thousands of citizens to beat the black students to the airport where they were then placed under protective arrest by the army.  Planes were arranged to fly them all back home.  I don&rsquo;t know what has happened since and I find it interesting that one would need to really dig to find this story.  Food for thought,hmm.</p>

		<p>My sister recently visited Italy and as non-political as she is, couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder on the number of blacks she saw in Rome. She said they would sell cheap merchandise on the streets and their sullen and hostile demeanors made one uncomfortable and wary wherever they would congregate.</p>
<p>I could imagine the scenario must be the same in Greece. One&rsquo;s gut feeling would immediately surmise that the Greeks are fed-up of the alien-looking eyesores they see on a day to day basis and the reaction stated in the article is a manifestation of that. Coupled with the difficult times and the unbelievable affront of the crime against a fellow Greek, the result is not surprising. If only all white countries would react the same way.</p>

		<p>I visited Pireas and Athens in 1992.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember seeing Pakistanis there. Albanians, yes, and the Greeks warned me against them:  &#8220;Oh, you shouldn&rsquo;t have bought that pack of cigarettes off her&#8221;, my host explained politely.  &#8220;She is Albanian, they steal from the kiosks&#8221;.  I heeded his advice.</p>
<p>I saw Greek beggars there.  Well, not beggars, they sold trinkets like pens and lighters.  I did make a point of buying from them - I was told Greece had no welfare for its citizens.  I gave some coin to an old blind woman with nothing to sell, as well.</p>
<p>If Greece had no welfare for its own citizens, what are these people coming there for?  Was Greece giving to these immigrants what it denied to its own citizens?</p>
<p>As far as safety goes, I had no worries.  My friends there tried to encourage me to stay, even, and said I could get a job at the airport, just because I could speak English, they said it didn&rsquo;t matter if I was still learning Greek, they wanted someone fluent in English.</p>
<p>I often thought I made a mistake in coming back home to Canada - I chickened out, didn&rsquo;t have confidence in my ability to assimilate properly.  Now I see stuff like this, and I know that, well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have liked it there very much any more.<br>

		<p>Anon. #30: No, FOX News is not on our side, and any close observation of what they say, and how they say it will show you that they are no more Conservative than the Neo-Cons that ruined our Country. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is one Broadcast that has its share of Reporters that actually tells you how it really is; and it amazes me that this News Station is doing this. It is WPIX Channel 11 News in New York City, of all places. </p>
<p>So if you are in Connecticut, New Jersey, or in such areas as Westchester County, New York you will be able to view this News cast. </p>
<p>I recommend that you wait until 10:45 and 10:47 p.m. EST when a Commentator named Lionel, who is a former Prosecutor, states his observations in a very Conservative, Tea Party, Common-sense style. </p>
<p>You can also visit the WPIX-TV website, and see if Lionel has any video commentaries on the latest Civic and Social issues. </p>
