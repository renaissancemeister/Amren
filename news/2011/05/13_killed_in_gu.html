		<p>In October 2010 an American named David Hartley was murdered while jetskiing on this lake by Mexican drug smugglers.  The lake is notorious, more like Pancho Villa territory 100 years ago.</p>

		<p>The Mexican govt has long known and tolerated the piracy and drug smuggling in and around Falcon Lake.</p>
<p>They probably raised their protection rates.  In a few days the drug smugglers and the Mexican police will negotiate a new rate and all will be peaceful again.</p>

		<p>I partly blame this on America&rsquo;s ludicrous prohibition laws on drugs. Marijuana SHOULD be legal. This is Al Capone all over again.</p>

		<p>Good job Marines! My condolences for the one Marine lost in the battle. Twelve Zetas dead, thousands more to go (hopefully).</p>

		<p>The problem with this story is the line that the fight happened &#8220;on the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no border. It is simply a geographic fiction that only exists on maps.</p>

<p>NO LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS! Where do you draw the line? At meth, cocaine, etc? CLOSE the freakin border for once and shoot to kill! Death sentences to drug DEALERS!</p>
<p> We have never been hard on these people whatsoever. Drug use is the bane of WHITE youth and whole families and to White survival. I don&rsquo;t care about &#8220;minorities&#8221; and what they use, I just want them out of here and not living among us. We are far too lenient when it comes to drugs and that is why it has skyrocketed in the last few decades. Get tough for once and get TOUGH laws and enforce it!</p>

		<p>From the short article it seems that the smugglers have been in operation for sometime.<i>&hellip;..Zetas were smuggling marijuana from the camp into Texas by speedboat.</i> It seems the Zetas found a good location that offered little or no resistance from  the US area of the lake.</p>
<p>Surely the Border Patrol could easily hear and see any boats coming over. What about all the gadgets we have become accustomed to such as super duper-drones (not Janet Napolitano, night vision gear, see into buildings machines,and other stuff used by any self respecting US police force against us?</p>
<p>Come to think of it maybe the crotch grabbers from the TSA should be deployed to the border so they can setup their porno-scaners. </p>

<p>It would indeed have to be the Marines since most of the Army is black or hispanic and English is NOT the primary language of the U.S. Army!</p>

		<p>Reply to #6:</p>
<p>Sorry but your social engineering will be no more successful with drugs then it was with alcohol via the temperance societies. In a free country, people will not stop doing something, simply because you do not want them to do it. Banning drug use is like banning breathing air. Prohibition does not work. History shows this.</p>

		<p>#6 - If all recreational drug use is wrong, then they should ban Viagra.</p>
<p>And also nicotine, caffeine, and, oh, alcohol .. but we all know how well THAT went last time.</p>
