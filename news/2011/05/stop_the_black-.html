<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hopkins [Bernard Hopkins, a Philadelphia boxer], for reasons that aren&rsquo;t clear to me even now, decided to tee off on McNabb [Donovan McNapp, a pro football quarterback] before an audience of reporters. He called McNabb a house slave. Which is, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the lexicon of black insults, about as low as you can go.</p>
<p>Hopkins implied that McNabb&rsquo;s relatively privileged upbringing  &mdash;  McNabb grew up in the suburbs, attended Catholic school and later did well at a fine university  &mdash;  somehow set him up for disappointment later in life, especially when he was traded from his longtime team.</p>
<p>Hopkins said that McNabb felt betrayed because &#8220;McNabb is the guy in the house, while everybody else is on the field. He&rsquo;s the one who got the extra coat, the extra serving.&#8221; Hopkins went on to say that McNabb has &#8220;a suntan, that&rsquo;s all.&#8221; Which is to say that&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s not really black. Which is also, in the lexicon of black insults, about as low as you can go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set aside the idea that any slave, in the house or not, had any grand time of it. {snip} [It&rsquo;s] the second time in two months that a prominent black athlete has made headlines by teeing off on another one, questioning his racial identity because one was raised in a functional environment  &mdash;  the kind most Americans aspire to  &mdash;  while the other was not.</p>
<p>Two months ago, this black-on-black hateration went viral because of The Fab Five documentary on ESPN, in which former University of Michigan basketball star Jalen Rose said that back then he considered former Duke University star Grant Hill, along with other black Duke ballplayers, to be Uncle Toms.</p>
<p>This, too, was all over the sports media and the blogosphere, culminating in an elegant rebuttal by Hill in The New York Times, where he took Rose to task for implying that educated people raised in functional households are somehow sellouts, whatever that means.</p>
<p>{snip} [We] probably should not because African-American athletes, Barack Obama notwithstanding, are still such prominent symbols of black life that people like Hopkins cannot be allowed to perpetuate the myth that blackness equals dysfunction, poverty, lack of academic achievement and success.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Who are the people who finance these films that sprout at least once or twice a year where any black person with a college or  &mdash;  god forbid  &mdash;  professional degree is set up as the buffoon, only so that he or she can be taken down a notch or two by ostensibly more authentic blue-collar kin? {snip} And why does every kid TV show seem to have an overly loud, shucking and jiving black sidekick whose job seems to be to show the white kids the latest dance move? Who&rsquo;s greenlighting those? And while we&rsquo;re at it, how long are we all going to stand by while youth sports are corrupted by sports pimps who only care about kids as their meal tickets to the pros?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sure, the idea that you have to be a thug to be cool or to be respected has more currency in some places than others. But I guarantee you that that idea is coming to a schoolyard near you if it&rsquo;s not there already. {snip}</p>

						<p>JUST DAYS before a title bout that could eclipse the miracles of George Foreman, ageless phenomenon Bernard Hopkins addressed what really matters:</p>
<p>Questioning former Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb&rsquo;s blackness and mettle.</p>
<p>According to Hopkins, McNabb had a privileged childhood in suburban Chicago and, as a result, is not black enough or tough enough, at least compared with, say, himself, Michael Vick and Terrell Owens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget this,&#8221; Hopkins said, pointing to his own dark skin. &#8220;He&rsquo;s got a suntan. That&rsquo;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopkins also implied that, while Vick and Owens remained true to their roots, McNabb did not, and that McNabb was rudely awakened when the Eagles traded him to the Redskins last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think McNabb felt he was betrayed? Because McNabb is the guy in the house, while everybody else is on the field. He&rsquo;s the one who got the extra coat. The extra servings. &#8216;You&rsquo;re our boy,&rsquo; &#8221; Hopkins said, patting a reporter on the back in illustration. &#8220;He thought he was one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Replace &#8220;guy in the house&#8221; with &#8220;slave in the house,&#8221; then replace &#8220;on the field&#8221; with &#8220;in the field,&#8221; and Hopkins&rsquo; message is Uncle Tom-clear.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yesterday, unprovoked, Hopkins fired again and again, using as ammunition McNabb&rsquo;s 2007 interview with HBO&rsquo;s &#8220;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,&#8221; in which McNabb addressed the problems for black quarterbacks in the NFL.</p>
<p>&#8220;He goes on HBO and talks about [being] black. He was right, but it was the wrong messenger. He was right, but [he doesn&rsquo;t] represent that,&#8221; Hopkins said. &#8220;The only reason he spoke was because he felt betrayed: &#8216;I thought I was one of y&rsquo;all&rsquo;s guys. I thought I was the good one. Y&rsquo;all told me this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they did what they always do, kicked his ass right [out of] there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopkins&rsquo; time line is a bit skewed, since the Eagles traded McNabb three seasons after the HBO interview. But then, Hopkins has plenty on his mind.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Eagles traded McNabb to the Redskins last year. Vick eventually won the Eagles&rsquo; quarterback job. Owens had a rough relationship with McNabb in his two seasons as an Eagle.</p>
<p>&#8220;McNabb? Great. Skills? Throw the ball? Great. But there was something missing,&#8221; Hopkins said. &#8220;Vick? He understands. And T.O.  &mdash;  same cloth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Owens, said Hopkins, was taken aback at how assimilated McNabb was: &#8220;T.O. got [into] the boardroom and saw the way they talked to McNabb. Coming from where he [comes from]  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s strange to some white people, when a black man speaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here, Hopkins&rsquo; publicist, who is white, gasped a little. But he was not to be deterred:</p>
<p>&#8220;When T.O. walks in the boardroom with the Eagles suits, he&rsquo;s like, &#8216;What the heck? I ain&rsquo;t used to this language. I&rsquo;m used to speaking up.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>So, too, is Hopkins.</p>

		<p>Similar news, and this has a teachable moment for some of you:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/P6G4d" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/P6G4d</a></p>
<p>The back story to this is that a few months ago, Jalen Rose called Grant Hill a &#8220;Tom&#8221; (in all essence), and Hill responded with an op-ed in the New York Times, essentially calling Rose a &#8220;street thug&#8221; (in a New York Times-y sort of way).  </p>
<p>They sure kissed and made up in a a hurry.</p>
<p>After this happened, a lot of white SWPL-types and race pandering lamestream conservative types started sucking up to Grant Hill.  And how does he reward them?  As you can see, he&rsquo;s helping to fund his very &#8220;adversary&rsquo;s&#8221; charter fool (sic), which will probably teach Afrocentric lies/mumbo jumbo. </p>
<p>The lesson for the day?  Erudite or street, a black is a black is a black is a black is a black is a black.</p>
<p>Now tell me again why you want to go out and vote for Allen West or Herman Cain for President, the few of you here who have those inclinations.</p>
<p>One more thing:  Whenever I hear blacks try to keep other blacks from fighting, I am always suspicious that their real agenda is to get blacks to fight and terrorize white people.  Especially if the story is related to &#8220;gang truces.&#8221;</p>

<p>We resent the blacks are allow to speak our White language, earn our White money, benefit from our White schools, medicine, government without having to first pay a race penalty tax for not first availing themselves exclusively of the inventions from Africa.</p>

		<p>We have plenty of diversity in our State Patrol, but we don&rsquo;t yet know the racial categories of the trooper and his dirt napping suspect, but we do know that the murder of a White Ga. trooper recently by a very black thug has helped raise the &#8220;trigger potential&#8221; of all troopers. </p>

		<p>Yet another word enters the American lexicon; Hateration.</p>
<p><i>And why does every kid TV show seem to have an overly loud, shucking and jiving black sidekick whose job seems to be to show the white kids the latest dance move? Who&rsquo;s greenlighting those?</i></p>
<p>Blacks are by choosing to support these roles (see Tyler Perrys&rsquo; Medea). These stereotype roles will continue until blacks stop acting like stereotypes.</p>
<p>Blacks want to see themselves portrayed as &#8216;authentic&rsquo;; ie, stereotypes. Only blacks are cool enough to teach white kids how to dance. Only blacks can give ignorant white boys advice on women. Only blacks can teach important lessons on civil rights and tolerance.</p>
<p>As for blacks turning on blacks. Why does this woman believe blacks shouldn&rsquo;t criticize or ridicule other blacks? Is she afraid that the world might see that blacks aren&rsquo;t speaking with one voice? That all blacks don&rsquo;t love each other and aren&rsquo;t united in the black power struggle?</p>
<p>Maybe blacks really have nothing else to complain about other than each other.</p>

		<p>As a white man with many years of experience with blacks, I assert that verbal aggression (they call it &#8220;dissing&#8221;) is a vital part of black behaviour. Actually &#8220;house slave&#8221; is their polite way of implying that a black has insufficient hostility to white men.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how your PBS is using your tax money. </p>
<p>Note to Ms. Martin: <i>hateration</i> is not a word. Stick to black/standard English, leave clever verbal manipulation to whites. Blacks trying to use white English are as foolish as whites trying to use black English. </p>

		<p>Cassius Clay used to pretty much say the same things except he managed to come across as wittier than the crude Hopkins. As a result whites praised him to the skies as being &#8220;charismatic&#8221;, as some great poet and social critic.<br>
Same message, different messenger, that&rsquo;s all.<br>
Even today whites will rush to speak up for the mentally subnormal Clay (IQ of 78) because they think he was charming. He was a member of the Elijah Muhammed cult whose theology all his white supporters should check into to find out what his views about them really were.<br>
Hopkins and Clay together could start their own think tank. </p>

		<p>So Mohammad Ali has an IQ of 78.  I thought so back when he was a young boxer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when he was Cassius Clay, the handsome young boxer.  I noticed that must have taken ballet at some point  because of his excellent balance and ability to just dance around his opponents.</p>
<p>But I always thought that someone must have written those cute poems he recited.  It was copied from that famous scene in Cyrano De Bergerac where Cyrano made up a poem about his opponent in a duel.  Then there were his cute comments that seemed carefully scripted and memorized.</p>
<p>Then the sudden so called Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  I always wondered if is just a coverup for his near retardation.  And of course the disease or whatever it is keeps him isolated so the spin doctors can make anything of him they want.  He&rsquo;s got a wife to control him too.</p>
<p>Unlike Tiger Woods, Mohammad Ali&rsquo;s keepers don&rsquo;t let him out so he can&rsquo;t get into trouble.</p>
<p>Reminds me of various retarded monarchs who were fixed up with a capable  wife and privy council.  Most of the population thought that the King ruled when actually the wife and councilors ran the country.</p>
<p>George Washington once said that a political party with a good newspaper campaign could take a broom, dress it up in coat and breeches and run it for President.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I hear from these neocon types about how great those two are! Talk show hosts, Tea Party(we are all equal types), and all the rest of the WHITE &#8220;conservatives&#8221; can&rsquo;t get enough of them.</p>
<p> I said when the BO won that the Republicans will for sure find a &#8220;conservative&#8221; black to run so they can show everybody that they are not &#8220;racist&#8221; and are all inclusive. They HATE to be called a racist more than they care about their own race or about America. I have a feeling that America will never see a White POTUS again. We can thank the left and the right for that.</p>
<p>When was the last time either party ever pandered for the White vote? I sure don&rsquo;t remember a time.</p>

		<p>This is exactly why blacks tend to do poorly in life. A culture whicn values failure is bound to turn out many failures. If a black person comes from a good background, speaks standard English, and does well in school, he&rsquo;s condemned by other blacks. Yet if a white person was to insinuate that black people had a moral duty to come across as ignorant and rowdy, you can just hear the loud accusations of racism.  </p>

<p>  I get the impression that NPR thinks that blacks shouldn&rsquo;t hate each other, but unite to fight the common enemy  &mdash;   white racism, or white males. It&rsquo;s hard to think of a single All Things Considered or Morning Edition broadcast that doesn&rsquo;t largely focus on blacks, other minorities, or the joys of diversity. According to the air time devoted to black political, social, and cultural issues on NPR, you&rsquo;d think that blacks made up at least 60% of the United States population.</p>

		<p>Every one of these black athlete vs. black athlete dustups seems to involve dark-skinned men against light-skinned men.  Of course, the latter is almost always more intelligent than the former and thus more white acting, just as real house slaves were in contrast to field slaves.  And, of course, blacks have always favored lighter skin, so it all looks like nothing more than jealousy.  <br>
In many parts of the world, these light-skinned blacks would be considered colored, and they would see themselves as distinctly different  &mdash;  and superior to  &mdash;  blacks.  </p>

		<p>The &#8220;crabs in a barrel&#8221; mentality and behavior of blacks has done more to hold them back than anything the white man has ever done to them. Even the lowest American ghetto-rat is better off than his African &#8220;bro.&#8221; we should declare a &#8220;Thank the White Man Month&#8221; in which blacks should be required to thank us for getting them out of that cesspit and onto the federal teat.

		<p>nope, no interest in Tyler Perry&rsquo;s tranny Madea movie or anything else involving &#8216;african-american&rsquo; culture- of which, there is none. PC lefties try to expound on their culture, potential, intelligence, etc. Logic and any experience dictates the contrary. <br>
No, they can keep their culture, worn out, simplistic 4th world language - ebonics, isn&rsquo;t it ? -and the rest.<br>
I and my family and friends have no interest.<br>
HOWEVER, I guarantee THEY have an interst in YOU. Your money, your pretty white daughter. Your car and house.<br>
Always remember, if you turn our back on a rabid dog, be prepared to get bit.<br>
and if you walk into the jungle without a rifle for protection, you&rsquo;re a fool.</p>

<p>How will white people in law enforcement and the military respond when ordered to fire on rioting whites when the genocidal policies of this nation are no longer tolerated? <br>

<p>Law enforcement and OUR military will be comprised of mostly NONwhites and they will gladly exterminate the Whites for sure. </p>
<p>As for the majority of our race ever waking up to riot, I even have less hope of that ever happening.</p>
<p>The Tea Party, the neocon talk show hosts, Faux News, etc. will NEVER allow Whites to EVER riot for their own survival. They REMIND us all the time that WE are the &#8220;civil&#8221; ones and better than that. It is already too late, thanks to these traitors.  Have you ever heard them talk about the DELIBERATE White replacement or genocide in this country? They are BOUGHT and PAID for sell-outs of our race. </p>
<p>They all have black and brown friends, don&rsquo;t you know. They have them as sidekicks and as employees. They have them as listeners and callers.  They PROMOTE a multiracial America. They promote blacks. They promote Mexicans, etc. Don&rsquo;t forget these same types brought us the Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Immigration Act. Ever try to call those programs and even DARE mention White replacement going on in this country and in Europe? You will be called every name in the book. And you know what names those will be. </p>
<p>The dems and the repubs are one and the same.</p>
