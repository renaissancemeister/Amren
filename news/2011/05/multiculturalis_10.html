<h1>Multiculturalism Takes Centre Stage in Montreal</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marian Scott, The Gazette (Montreal), May 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Violent attacks against the Roma. The rise of far right parties. And declarations by the leaders of the UK, Germany and France that multiculturalism has failed.</p>
<p>What does Europe have to teach Quebec and English Canada about intercultural harmony?</p>
<p>Well, quite a bit, says Gérard Bouchard, organizer of this week&rsquo;s symposium on interculturalism, which has brought together experts from two continents to share wisdom on managing diversity.</p>
<p>The European experience could be instructive for Quebec, where Canadian multiculturalism is considered incompatible with the preservation of French language and culture, according to the organizer of the three-day conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mediate between different cultures in a way that ensures the future of the host society, in the sense of its history, values and profound aspirations, and at the same time respects individual rights?&#8221; asked Bouchard, a history and sociology professor at the Université du Québec in Chicoutimi.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all answer, Bouchard said. &#8220;Every nation must invent its own solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the UK, some of the most successful initiatives to promote intercultural harmony have been local rather than nationwide, said Ted Cantle, executive chair of the Institute of Community Cohesion in Coventry, England. As an example, he showed a poster encouraging volunteerism and cultural exchanges in Blackburn with Darwen, Lancashire, one of Britain&rsquo;s most multicultural areas. It pictures two volunteers  &mdash;  one of English origin and the other South Asian  &mdash;  with the caption: &#8220;Many lives &hellip;  many faces &hellip;  all belonging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cantle, author of a report on race riots in northern England in 2001, denounced the loss of cohesion and social capital in communities where minorities often live parallel lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new era of mass migration, of visible communities and an era of super-diversity,&#8221; said Cantle, pointing out that 300 languages are spoken in London.</p>
<p>Thanks to globalization and social networks, communities reach around the world and intersect with each other, creating new, complex relationships that transcend traditional definitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Identity is multi-dimensional,&#8221; he said, pointing to another poster of a character in the 2004 Ken Loach movie Ae Fond Kiss, where a character describes herself as &#8220;a Glaswegian Pakistani teenager of Muslim descent who supports Glasgow Rangers (a Protestant team) in a Catholic school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cantle warned that the rise of right-wing extremism in Europe threatens efforts to promote inclusion.</p>
<p>The UK helps immigrants to improve their English skills but also encourages them to retain their own language and culture, he said. Cantle said that while France has banned the niqab face veil and bars religious symbols like the hijab head scarf from schools, such a move would be an unthinkable invasion of personal choice in the UK.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, an anti-immigrant backlash has caused a rejection of multiculturalism policies promulgated in the 1980s, said Frank Lechner, a professor of sociology at Emory University in Atlanta. But he added that while many say newcomers should try harder to adopt Dutch values, the country remains quite multicultural, with 20 per cent of residents having non-Dutch ancestry.</p>
<p>&#8220;National policy has become tougher but at the local level there remains a good deal of goodwill towards cultural communities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Will Kymlicka, Canada Research Chair in political philosophy at Queen&rsquo;s University, said that multiculturalism continues to be a success story in English Canada. &#8220;Compared to other western democracies, immigrant integration seems to be going comparatively well in Canada,&#8221; he said. Immigrants to English Canada are more likely to vote, run for office, succeed in school and work and live in mixed neighbourhoods than elsewhere in the world, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems almost unthinkable to give up multiculturalism,&#8221; Kymlicka said.</p>

		<p>We need to dump the term &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; as well as this new label, &#8220;interculturalism,&#8221; for many reasons, the largest of which is that its proponents are insincere.  They do not, when they have a chance, genuinely promote each and every culture.  </p>
<p>When you can get close and personal, you will note that multiculturalism is designed to create a new culture, one that promotes The Anti-White Narrative, and seeks to name, label, define, and describe us (a supremacist trait when we do the naming).  The proponents of multiculturalism are multi-racialists, liars, bigots, haters, and bullies   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s call them those terms.</p>
<p>As a small bit of evidence, consider FGM and MGM.  Each practice stems from religious beliefs that Christians do not hold as religious beliefs, but two other religious cling to.  If multiculturalists believed their preachments, FGM (female genital mutilation) would not be frowned on in foreign countries or even in the USA, but it surely is.  </p>
<p>The so-called radical feminists were quick to rush to establish ways and means of ending FGM all over the globe.  So much for the idea that cultures, no matter what, should be upheld.  MGM, however, like religious taxes on food for all of us and unusual animal butchering practices, is part of a bundle of cultures by others that are successfully made part of our culture.</p>
<p>The reality that the label &#8220;multiculturalist&#8221; masks is simply &#8220;multi-racialism&#8221; and we ought to refer to it as such.  Sometimes it is fun and productive to use words and labels from the anti-whites, especially the white anti-whites, like deconstruction, hegemony, and essentialism, but multiculturalism is such a Big Lie that we need to really think about using multi-racialism in its place.</p>

But there are others like our Hispanic immigrants who retain their national loyalties. Most maintain dual citizenship, root for their national sports teams and proudly display their hatred for the US teams. They don&rsquo;t intend to become Americans. They demonstrate for open borders- to the south that is. They want to establish a colony and then a nation within a nation. Can you cite an example of legislation by LULAC or CBC which was designed to benefit this nation - not just their ethnic group?<br>

AR asks the question:</p>
<p><i>If diversity is a strength, why is it treated like a problem that needs a solution?</i></p>
<p>The cultists answer,</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It seems almost unthinkable to give up multiculturalism,&rdquo; Kymlicka said.</i></p>
<p>I could be that the cultists are becoming increasingly aware of a growing racial consciousness questioning multiCULTuralism. Those pushing this agenda have to get past the tipping point so there will be no unity or resistance. Hence their need to push harder.</p>
<p>Racial awareness is born of experience. The more people have multiCULTuralism forced on them, the more they will resist. </p>

The only rational policy is deportations and mass expulsions, followed by a rigid policy of &#8216;whites only&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You cannot be a white nationalist if you cling to the belief that other races can be assimilated into ours.  </p>
<p>No multiculturalism. No assimilation. No immigration. It is not a criticism of any race or creed that we must be exclusive. It is a precondition for our survival.</p>

		<p>2-Berin: &#8221; Immigrants who are willing to become participating citizens are often beneficial and are welcome.&#8221; - No they are not. Being displaced by &#8220;beneficial&#8221; non-Whites means we are still being displaced.  Would 500 million &#8220;beneficial&#8221; Chinese immigrants be of any benefit? How about 500 million &#8220;beneficial&#8221; Africans? I would think not. Your comment is one of being pro-multiculturalism or pro racial-mixing and in my view, is contrary to White ethnocentrism.  Whites can generally assimilate into other White cultures, but non-Whites, no matter how &#8220;White&#8221; they may walk, talk, and act, will never by White.</p>

		<p>Not a single word spoken about any &#8216;benefits&rsquo; of multiculturalism to native White people. Just endless nonsense about solving the problems that occurred after it was implemented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cantle warned that the rise of right-wing extremism in Europe threatens efforts to promote inclusion.&#8221;<br>
No, the policy of multiculturalism is what threatens inclusion.</p>
<p>And why does &#8216;inclusion&rsquo; need to be promoted at all if multiculturalism really is a strength? Inclusion doesn&rsquo;t need to be promoted in homogeneous areas.</p>

<p>No, the trick isn&rsquo;t &#8220;assimilation&#8221;. The trick is to deport them all. We cannot nor should we ever &#8220;assimilate&#8221; different races of people into this nation. It is impossible and we all see the results, don&rsquo;t we? No nation can or will survive a country full of different races and we all know it. </p>
<p>From your name I take it you are an &#8220;immigrant&#8221;. No disrespect, but it just isn&rsquo;t the Mexicans or La Raza, etc. that have dual citizenship and will defend their own homeland over ours. ALL races do the same thing. The truth is, non-whites will never be an &#8220;American&#8221; in my eyes. </p>
<p>Like I said no disrespect to you personally, but I am for my own race and my own country&rsquo;s survival over any misguided acceptance/tolerance for other races in my homeland. I am sure you would feel the same about your own homeland.</p>
<p>It (our nation) was never formed to even consider bringing in the different races, religions of the world. This was the concept put forth by the enemies within that it was a &#8220;good&#8221; thing to do. We all know their diabolical agenda. They want only to destroy the White race and their nations. </p>

		<p>One of the bigger failings of multiculturalism is that it breaks the promise that governments would not need to manage culture. It was claimed that all cultures are equal and that people are naturally tolerant of differences. There should be no need for government to get involved in culture. The promise is especially important because modern democratic governments are not well designed to manage culture and especially competing cultural groups. After a few decades the verdict is in and multiculturalism is a failure. Government is now required to get into culture management. How is this to be done, especially as the years go by and the problems get worse? We need theory from political philosophy professors, not denials and excuses.</p>

<p>EXACTLY!  I have always felt and said the same thing!  Assimilation of different races has NEVER worked and never will. It&rsquo;s genetics that binds us together. Separation is the only solution to our racial survival. A complete DIVORCE, under a CONTRACT that can never be broken. As for the White race traitors, they and their offspring, will have to live with their &#8220;other half&#8221; in their own &#8220;paradise&#8221;, otherwise they and their mindsets and offspring will pollute any White homeland, hence we will have the same mess we have now.</p>

		<p>It is foolish to think that the solution to multiculturalism is &#8220;multiculturalism lite.&#8221; Third Worlders cannot assimilate to American culture, and most of them don&rsquo;t even want to try. Activists on both the Left and the Right say (correctly) that America shouldn&rsquo;t be the world&rsquo;s policeman, but only very rarely do you hear one, from either side, say (correctly) that America shouldn&rsquo;t be the world&rsquo;s refugee camp. Talk about brown Third Worlders who are &#8220;oppressed&#8221; and &#8220;just want a better life&#8221; needs to be countered with the fact that the legitimate purpose of immigration is to benefit the host country. It is not America&rsquo;s responsibility to give the world&rsquo;s poor, who create the squalor they live in through their own self-destructive behavior, a &#8220;better life.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side, it is just as foolish to promote a 100% pure Aryan nation-state as the solution. The majority of WHITE people will always oppose this for many reasons, not the least of which is that a lot of good white people do not fall under the narrow definition of &#8220;Aryan.&#8221; Such a state would be neither feasible nor desirable. Absolute purity is unnecessary - does the small number of white people living in Japan (I&rsquo;ve seen some of them post on Amren, BTW) wreck Japan&rsquo;s national, cultural, and racial identity? Obviously not. A similarly small number of Japanese in our country will not destroy our identity either. (A small number - any number - of Somalis WILL. Absolutely no Somalis, Yemenis, Saudis, etc.) I was once asked by a race-denying faux-conservative what the difference was between race realists and white supremacists. Besides, of course, the fact that white supremacists want to dominate and control others while race realists just want to raise our children in peace without black ghetto thugs or brown Mexican invaders ruining our schools. I replied that white supremacists see all non-whites as evil and interchangeable, while race realists recognize that there are differences between the non-white races as well as between whites and non-whites. We recognize that Japanese and Somalis are not the same and treat them accordingly. In a rather hilarious irony, both the white supremacist and the race-denier would treat the Japanese and the Somali exactly the same!</p>
<p>What we need is an immigration policy that is pragmatic and pro-white. A simple repeal of the odious 1965 Immigration Act and a return to pre-1965 immigration policy, which was pro-white back when white people liking themselves was still considered natural, will do the trick. The &#8220;500 million Chinese immigrants&#8221; that one poster was worried about would never be allowed to flood America under this policy. We should be returning to 1940s American values and neither sticking with 21st century multiculturalism nor going to 1940s German values. There are liars and deceivers on both our side and the opposition who think that pro-white means pro-Nazi. They are wrong. Remember, Hitler, who was genuinely evil, was defeated and millions of lives were saved by a SEGREGATED Allied military where the WHITE MAN did virtually all the fighting.</p>
<p>No to the brown Third World invader - legal OR illegal - and the Newt Gingrich types who support him. No to Adolf Hitler. Yes to 1940s America, pragmatism, and white self-respect.</p>

<p> I was trying to formulate a response to expand your comment - but couldn&rsquo;t!  You said it all.  Excellent post.  My own family has both Aryan-looking, and swarthy types; but we are all/each 100% of European ancestry, and can trace ALL our ancestry back to Europe. (I know, I am the unofficial family historian.)  My mother (thank God still with us) has 21 descendants ranging from the olive-skinned to the blue-eyed and flaxen-haired, with everything (except redheads) in between.</p>

<p>Exactly.  And in the long run, there will be no difference.</p>
<p>Probably as a result of 1945,  in the political-philosophical context of today&rsquo;s world, language and culture are permissible subjects to discuss. These are recognized and allowed by Marxists as legitimate concerns.  But anything about race or genes is NOT. Race and genetics are absolutely taboo, and to bring them up is to be branded a nazi, a lunatic, a white supremecist, and someone who is completely beyond the pale of decent society&hellip; a reprobate, a pariah, a person whose views are not worthy of being heard.</p>
<p>Hence, preservation of their <i>language</i>  and <i>culture </i> were the only routes allowed for nationalists in Quebec. But in the end, all of that will go and will be meaningless. Without the PEOPLE who sustain the language, what good is it?  Will Quebec still be Quebec when it is populated with French-speaking Algerians, Congolese, and Haitians?</p>
<p>Or will &#8220;English Canada&#8221; still be the same when it is populated with Pakistanis, Somalis, Sudanese, and Jamaicans?</p>
<p>Such folly!</p>

		<p>14-Anon: &#8220;As for the White race traitors, they and their offspring, will have to live with their &ldquo;other half&rdquo; in their own &ldquo;paradise&rdquo;, otherwise they and their mindsets and offspring will pollute any White homeland, hence we will have the same mess we have now.&#8221;: Agree, but keep in mind though that liberalism will arise in any set of humans. We will need to keep our children informed of what liberalism is and explain to them just why it is such a bad thing for our future nation.  The prime example of course will be the failed United States, with multiculturalism and immigration being the primary causes of the failure.  As for 5-Anon and the idea of mass deportations and expulsions, such actions will come to pass.  Don&rsquo;t be too confident though, as at the current rate of immigration, those being deported or expelled may well be Whites being sent to some resevation in Northern Canada.

<p>&#8220;Racial awareness is born of experience. The more people have multiCULTuralism forced on them, the more they will resist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the irony of it all?</p>

<p>&#8220;No multiculturalism. No assimilation. No immigration. It is not a criticism of any race or creed that we must be exclusive. It is a precondition for our survival.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but I don&rsquo;t know if that is 100% possible.</p>
<p>What about diplomats? Trade? Secret Service? Etc?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It seems almost unthinkable to give up multiculturalism,&rdquo; Kymlicka said.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s referring to giving up multiculturism voluntarily, of course.  But he doesn&rsquo;t realize that neither he nor the elites will have any control over the breakdown in society caused primarily by multiculturalism itself, and that it won&rsquo;t be necessary to give it up at all, because diversity is doomed to fail.  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time.  Nobody has to do anything or &#8220;give up&#8221; anything.  The natural consequence of multiculturalism is self-destruction.</p>
<p>Somebody should let them know that nothing needs to be invoked or enacted regarding tribalism, because the chaos resulting from it causes a destruction of society which can&rsquo;t be stopped.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is a self destruct situation that will always reach a point that is unsustainable.  Always.</p>

		<p>15-SNAviatrix: &#8220;On the other side, it is just as foolish to promote a 100% pure Aryan nation-state as the solution.&#8221; Well, not if Aryan&rsquo;s would like to remain somewhere as a nation state, say Germany for example, and where they live in peace and don&rsquo;t forcefully immigrate to their neighbors lands. I agree though, that some future White ethno-state somewhere in North America would not be an Aryan state, but neither do I see any reason to include any non-Whites.  Why do so?  Want to have an &#8220;authentic&#8221; Chinese restaurant in your town? Fine, but disallow citizenship and if/when the restauranteurs have children, the whole family (mixed-race or not) is deported.  There are other solutions that are not dacronian but for which a White ethno-state can be allowed to have some sense of existence well into the future. &#8220;Mixed-race lite&#8221; may well provide the impetus to lead us back to where we are now with America.</p>

<p>I agree with most of what you said however, what do you consider to be a small amount of racial aliens living in the US? In the 1940s the US was 90 percent White, 9 percent black and the rest were mostly American Indians, mestizos and trace elements of orientals.  There are some people who claim to be White and nationalist but when it comes to orientals or other Asians they want them included in any renaissance of America.  Indians come from a society that is in most respects more squalid and poverty stricken than Mexico or anything outside of Africa.  I oppose large numbers of orientals because they compete with Americans for high skill labor and they are willing to work for less which is why companies hire them.  They are also very ethnocentric and we already see they form voting blocs with other minorities against the White majority.  We can also gather from the headlines that there are also large numbers of spies being employed in companies and the federal government that leak information back to the motherland. The oriental and the Somali are both threats only in different ways.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Compared to other western democracies, immigrant integration seems to be going comparatively well in Canada,&rdquo; - what nonsense. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect an honest position from a multiculturalist.</p>
<p>It amazes me how liberal do-gooder whites are willing to assist in destroying our superior cultures. Third world cultures and people are a burden on society, drain on welfare, more likely to commit crime and produce inter-tribal dramas.</p>
<p>In Sydney, the gangland tribalism is out of control. The Canterbury- Bankstown area in Western Sydney is the most diverse area in Australia and suffers from an unemployment rate of 49.5% - the highest in Australia. This area also tops the league in every crime category. Despite the statistics that prove multiculturalism is a total failure  Australian left wing politicians still paint the area as a success - derr!</p>

<p>Well sure. If you consider white people giving away and surrendering their country to alien black brown and yellow people &#8220;going well&#8221;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I consider it a crime and treason.</p>

		<p>Oh sure, immigrant immgration is going &#8220;comparatively well&#8221;, is it.  Look at this:</p>
