			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles A. Roberts, American Renaissance, January 2002</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> <span class="dropcap">O</span>n September 11, 2001, multiculturalism
 came to America in a firestorm of glass and steel. Air travel shut 
down, tall buildings were evacuated, the stock market collapsed, and our
 government briefly went into hiding. Now America is at war. The 
authorities tell us our enemy Osama bin Laden has terrorist cells in 
dozens of countries, including the United States. Muslim fanatics 
plotting the next attack may even be living in your neighborhood right 
now. </p>
        <p> How did this come to pass? When did Americans decide to live
 in a racial Tower of Babel instead of the House of their Fathers? The 
beginnings of what we now call multiculturalism go back even before <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i>
 but this poisonous thinking took on a particular flavor in the 1990s 
when the allegedly African proverb &#8220;It takes a village to raise a 
child,&#8221; became popular. This was soon shortened to &#8220;It takes a village,&#8221;
 not just to raise a child, but presumably to bring about all the other 
liberal happy endings towards which we are supposed to be working. Most 
intelligent people thought it a trendy, vacuous expression, and ignored 
it. But no one understood better than Hillary Clinton that with enough 
repetition people can be made to take an imbecile idea very seriously 
indeed. </p>
        <table class="boxleft">

            <td><img src="/ar/2002/01/c-osamasml.JPG" alt="Osama bin Laden" height="171" width="130" /> </td>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Mrs. Clinton even wrote a book about the village. Her 
&#8220;village&#8221; is the &#8220;global village&#8221; of the 21st century. It is a happy 
place, full of mixed religions, mixed races, and mixed cultures. It is a
 place where everyone belongs to everyone else, and everyone is the 
same. It is a place where &#8220;incorrect thinking&#8221; is a psychological 
disorder or a hate crime, and every Crayola box has only one color: 
brown. It is a feed-lot vision of humanity, in which the entire human 
race can be bred, fed, and processed. </p>
        <p> The multiculturalist does not see the world as a host of 
nations, each with its own culture and racial order. He sees it as a 
sociological problem. Indeed, human reality with all its foibles is 
abhorrent to the multiculturalist. For the multiculturalist, people are 
not really equal; they are merely the same. And it is sameness that he 
seeks to stamp upon the soul of every man. This is why the 
multiculturalist celebrates the &#8220;village&#8221; as the highest stage of 
mankind. Of course, in the real world, the village is filthy, poor and 
ignorant. It took mankind 10,000 years of tears and sorrow to escape 
from the village, but Mrs. Clinton wants to send everyone back. </p>
        <p> Her approach leads to the disappearance of the white race 
through amalgamation, a kind of genocide through race immersion, and 
there is a good chance this will happen. Whites are now perhaps 10 
percent of the world&rsquo;s population, whereas in 1900 they were 40 percent.
 </p>
        <p> Millions of Americans now believe that a multicultural 
world, full of harmony, euphoria, and brown-skinned dullards is the 
destiny of mankind   &mdash;   at least for whites. It does not occur to them that
 black and Asian countries, for example, are not turning brown but 
staying exactly as they were. This vision of brown-skinned 
multiculturalism took hold in full force only after the end of the Cold 
War, when it was widely believed that world conflict had come to an end.
 A new world order would emerge, in which there would be no more 
nationalism, racism, or war. </p>
        <p> Among the duped were several liberal historians, chief among
 them Francis Fukuyama. For him, the end of the cold war meant the &#8220;end 
of history.&#8221; &#8220;We may be witnessing,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;the end of history as 
such: that is, the endpoint of mankind&rsquo;s ideological evolution and the 
universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human
 government.&#8221; The &#8220;end of history&#8221; would signal the end of the &#8220;war of 
ideas&#8221; particularly those involving race, religion, culture and history.
 People around the world would no longer care about why they live, but 
only how well. Prof. Fukuyama, himself, found the prospect of living in 
such a world rather boring. </p>
        <p> But the giddy expectations that followed the collapse of the
 Berlin Wall were dissipated by the ethnic warfare that erupted all 
around the world. It was in the post-war period that the now familiar 
term &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; was first used, though it described a process as
 old as tribal warfare. Neo-communist, nationalist, irredentist, 
fascist, and religious fundamentalist groups began appearing, all 
apparently bent on keeping history from ending and destroying the new 
world order that had just been born. </p>
        <p> Of particular interest in this regard were the national and 
religious struggles in the Balkans. Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Macedonians
 and Albanians all wanted ethnic purity rather than diversity, and many 
were prepared to go to war to expand the borders of their ethnic 
enclaves. NATO and the United Nations were called in to enforce the 
desired &#8220;multicultural paradigm,&#8221; but the unsuccessful effort to make 
disparate peoples live together in harmony grinds on to this day. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Of course, multiculturalism not only raises up murderers 
abroad; it breeds them at home. Investigators now know that in the weeks
 preceding the attacks of Sept. 11, four suicide squads crisscrossed the
 country. They enrolled in flight schools, rented apartments, and bought
 cars without attracting attention. It appears that none of them feared a
 &#8220;tip-off&#8221; to police by any of their accomplices. In a multicultural 
country, competing loyalties are strong enough to ensure secrecy. </p>
        <p> At the same time it is extremely difficult for agents to 
infiltrate terrorist cells in ethnic enclaves, just as it is difficult 
to infiltrate Chinese Triads, Jamaican Posses, or Vietnamese &#8220;home 
invasion&#8221; gangs. The glaring racial and cultural differences make 
conventional police work largely ineffective. Suspects often have long, 
unpronounceable names, and lurk in dense ethnic neighborhoods, where 
they can mix with large numbers of rootless immigrants like themselves 
and remain invisible. </p>
        <p> Uniquely American racial hysteria adds another obstacle to 
penetrating ethnic ghettos in search of terrorists. If the police make 
an arrest, trouble soon follows. Radical civil-liberties lawyers drag 
entire police departments into court on so-called &#8220;profiling&#8221; charges. 
Detaining, questioning, and otherwise &#8220;suspecting&#8221; people of color is a 
delicate undertaking in today&rsquo;s America. Too many law enforcement 
agencies have already been ravaged by federal lawsuits for so-called 
&#8220;civil rights&#8221; violations, so that even in this time of &#8220;war,&#8221; we must 
be careful not to hurt the feelings of the communities in which the 
&#8220;enemy&#8221; hides. In the current multicultural hell, the police are 
fighting against almost impossible odds when it comes to crime of this 
kind. </p>
        <p> <b>Apart at the Multicultural Seams</b> </p>
        <p> In <i>The Clash of Civilizations,</i> Samuel Huntington 
concludes that if it does not quickly move to reclaim its Western 
European (read white, Christian) roots, America will soon become what he
 calls a &#8220;cleft&#8221; nation. Cleft nations are riven by chronic internal 
conflict and disunion. This happens when countries abandon the 
religious, cultural, racial, and historical structures on which they 
were founded, and on which their very survival depends. </p>
        <p> In the name of multiculturalism, racial minorities and 
anarcho-liberals have waged war on the historic identity of the United 
States, and the value of Western culture in general. They have 
resolutely denied that a common American culture even exists. At the 
same time they demand a universalist order that would impose their 
political and racial vision onto the entire world. These groups are 
supported by other subnational elements that include radical feminists, 
homosexuals, liberation theologians, and Hispanic groups that are 
already mapping out large portions of America for annexation. By 
steadily tearing at the cultural and institutional fabric of the United 
States, these groups are changing the very moral foundations of the 
nation. Some of the most obvious examples of decline include: </p>
        <ol><li> Open racial violence against whites. </li><li> Rejection of normative sexual and social behaviors. </li><li> Increased family decay, and the abdication of parental responsibility. </li><li> Dramatic decline in the willingness of young people to 
identify with the United States and to defend its political or cultural 
ideals. </li><li> Unwillingness to defend America&rsquo;s borders from millions of immigrants. </li><li> The increasing division of public choices   &mdash;   whether 
elections, curriculum choices, budget decisions, jury verdicts, cultural
 observances   &mdash;   along openly racial lines. </li></ol>
        <p> As Prof. Huntington explains, cleft societies lose the power
 to control their own destinies. They are only as culturally strong as 
their weakest cultural link. In America, multiculturalism has advanced 
the power and interests of every subclass   &mdash;   and subrace   &mdash;   over that of 
the white European, but it is the worst sort of folly to believe that 
once non-whites have reduced whites to a minority they will usher in the
 multicultural utopia. Multiculturalism advances always and only at the 
expense of whites. Non-whites will turn on each other once they have 
reduced the peoples and culture of the West to the status of one more 
squabbling minority. </p>

        <p> The inauguration of &#8220;diversity&#8221; as the new doctrine of 
national conformity was not just a dramatic break with the past; it was a
 rejection of the past. The Founding Fathers believed diversity lead to 
faction, disharmony and abuse of the law. Abraham Lincoln hoped to use 
the occasion of war to persuade all blacks to leave the United States. A
 half century later, Woodrow Wilson, fearing that too much diversity was
 arriving on American shores, almost completely shut off immigration. 
Theodore Roosevelt agreed, saying, &#8220;The one absolutely certain way of 
bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its 
continuing as a nation at all would be to permit it to become a tangle 
of squabbling nationalities.&#8221; </p>
        <p> In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the great wisdom evinced by
 the founders was set aside, and multiculturalism gradually became 
America&rsquo;s new guiding principle. Since then it has eaten away at 
American ideals and replaced common sense with a whole series of 
contradictions: We worship non-discrimination, and to achieve it we must
 discriminate against whites. We worship diversity of race, religion, 
and culture but despise diversity of opinion. We worship freedom of 
speech but must never hurt the feelings of non-whites. We worship 
democracy but ignore the majority&rsquo;s opposition to immigration, 
homosexuality, racial preferences, foreign aid, etc. We worship freedom 
and responsibility but believe the failures of non-whites are all caused
 by whites. We condemn racial stereotyping but assume that all whites 
are &#8220;racists.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Astonishingly, as whites dismantle their own institutions, 
they increasingly try to impose an unworkable and uniquely Western 
concept of pluralism on the rest of the world. The primary tools for 
this are economic success   &mdash;   and the envy and prestige this brings   &mdash;   and 
tremendous media power, but the West is also willing to kill people to 
teach them to live together in harmony. </p>
        <p> Regardless of whatever end-of-history illusions whites have 
crafted for themselves, in the 21st century, race and culture will 
determine the fate of nations. Ideology will hardly matter. The failed 
ideologies of the last era   &mdash;   Marxism, socialism, fascism   &mdash;   were all 
experiments against reality. Although its proponents are willfully blind
 to the evidence, multiculturalism is a similarly failed experiment. It 
is only whites who promote their own dispossession, and because it is 
only whites who refuse to defend themselves against alien people and 
cultures, it is only whites who face the prospect of oblivion. In the 
world that is rapidly taking shape, the races and cultures that prevail 
will be overwhelmingly non-western. Most will be anti-American. The 
powerhouses of the new century will be racist, xenophobic, and 
religiously dogmatic. They will not be multicultural. </p>
        <p> In America prevailing dogma flies in the face of this 
reality. Indeed, the events of September 11 are a chilling testament to 
the fact that history has not ended, that there are still people willing
 to die for what they believe. Moreover, these events show the awesome 
power of unity, of homogeneous peoplehood and vivid conviction. 
Americans speak of the &#8220;heroism&#8221; in us that the attacks have brought 
forth, as if it were somehow praiseworthy not to have let a few 
terrorists reduce the entire country to quivering helplessness. What if 
we were <i>really</i> tested? We are now a heterogeneous, 
conflict-ridden people with competing and incompatible loyalties. What 
could be more ludicrous than the prospect of such a people, smothered in
 platitudes about &#8220;tolerance,&#8221; &#8220;inclusion,&#8221; &#8220;sensitivity,&#8221; and 
&#8220;diversity,&#8221; trying to fight a real war of mass conscription and tens of
 thousands of casualties? Men fight for blood and soil, for the deepest 
of shared convictions, for the very opposite of &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and 
&#8220;diversity.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Despite the increasingly clear warnings of dangers ahead, 
the dark night of multiculturalism continues to envelop America. Given 
enough time, the acids of multiculturalism will burn out the very soul 
of America. Other nations in the world, friend and foe alike, will take 
note of this. In their own quiet way, they are already on the move.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" /> </p>

		<p>I disagree with his point number 4 showing evidence of our declining &#8220;Dramatic decline in the willingness of young people to identify with the United States and to defend its political or cultural ideals&#8221;. Young people are Extremely willing to defend our political and cultural ideals. The basic ideal seems to be &#8216;white = bad, color = good&rsquo; and no absurdity too low to stoop to in order to defend that ideal. The author gets to that in the rest of his very fine article. </p>
<p>He also writes, &#8220;Non-whites will turn on each other once they have reduced the peoples and culture of the West to the status of one more squabbling minority&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a pipe dream! There has been a precedent set concerning this issue. I don&rsquo;t believe Germans turned on each after successfully persecuting Jews in their country. They were united in support of their own equally hateful ideology till the very end and Germany&rsquo;s physical destruction.  </p>

		<p>I was thinking about the non-compatability of cultures just today.  I was walking in a high school - some non-white students (it&rsquo;s a 99.99% non-white school, of course) were walking by cursing loudly.  Every other word was the &#8220;F&#8221; curse.  A moment later, a couple of girls walked by and one of then was talking loudly about how h  &mdash;  rny she was.  (I am not kidding).</p>
<p>Then I walked to my hallway and saw at least 50-60 students milling about the hall, pushing, play-fighting, necking in every corner AFTER the bell had rung to get to class.  It took almost ten minutes for the hall to clear.  In the classes very little actual work gets done.  Shucking, jiving, emotional problems, outburts&hellip;  All us teachers complain about it all the time.</p>
<p>The students are basically all black and latino here.  They have their own cultural rythmn.  They love music to the point of excess (rap and bachata), they see no difference between telling a lie and telling the truth, they are so over sexualized that they will just talk about it out of nowhere, they are as a rule addicted to internet porn and social media sites, they steal and cheat in the school and don&rsquo;t even bother to hide it and they revel in their ignorance and wear it like a badge of honor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my kids to cuss and curse.  I don&rsquo;t want them to think having sex at age 12 or 13 is normal.  I don&rsquo;t want them to take the thug/gang/rapper life as normal.  I don&rsquo;t want them to keep an Ipod in the ear at all times.  I don&rsquo;t want them rapping stupidly or wearing their pants down to their knees or talking ghetto trash or thinking it&rsquo;s okay to kiss any random girl or guy and worse.  </p>
<p>Am I so wrong for saying I don&rsquo;t want these things for my children?  I know there are some good black and latino parents who don&rsquo;t want that stuff either, but like it or not those things are DEFINING characteristics of black and latino youth culture these days.  No one can tell me any differnetly because 90% of the latino youth I know and 99% of the black youth I know are following those things.  Years of teaching has revealed nothing different.  I try to keep the faith and influence my students to be something else, but then I realize I am asking them to be more like my white culture, and at the end of the day that&rsquo;s not THEIR culture.</p>
<p>I want a liberal to read these words and ask me why I have to sacrifice my culture for something that is so inferior.  Do they think latino machismo doesn&rsquo;t exist here?  Do they think latino cultures are so advanced?  Do they think that the gangsta&rsquo; rap lifestlye is conducive to being a savvy human rights pacifist?  </p>
<p>I want liberals to put their values on the line and take their kids out of private schools and lily white suburbs and throw them in the ghetto grinder.  No Sidwell Friends or Country Day schools!  They would never do these things though because they&rsquo;re hypocrites at heart.  But I wish they would just admit that they don&rsquo;t want their kids to become like the &#8216;youf&rsquo; of amerika.</p>

		<p>2 Jay and to other teachers:</p>
<p>Question, while I&rsquo;m thinking about something you said that might push this discussion a bit OT:  I saw a bunch of high school students on a field trip today, from several St. Louis area high schools, black and white.  As I saw them, I thought to myself, who does First Lady Michelle Obama think she&rsquo;s fooling when she says that all these teenagers are obese so they all have to get out and dance to a Beyonce song?  Most of the students I saw are so thin and skinny and emaciated that a good stiff breeze would knock them over&hellip;except for the black girls, a majority of whom were obviously overweight, a significant percentage were way overweight. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think that Michelle Obama is on this &#8220;obesity&#8221; kick precisely because it&rsquo;s young black women who are largely obese.  If that&rsquo;s the case, then it&rsquo;s no surprise, because she is a black woman, therefore she would notice the plight of black women first.  From what I saw, though, most of the white men, white women and black men needed a &#8220;let&rsquo;s move&#8221; campaign of their own   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s move to the weight room and get some muscle on our bones before we spontaneously disappear.  I know that a teenager isn&rsquo;t going to weigh as much as an adult in his or her 30s, and an adult man of 34 will generally have much more muscle mass than a teenage boy of 16.  But I never remember being that skinny when I was in high school.  Very few of the guys in my class or in my high school that matter were so skinny.</p>

		<p>The Germans were as united in their hateful ideology as today&rsquo;s Englishman is firmly behind the PC multiculturalism. The difference is that the Englishman of today has managed to put a small brake on it, dissenters are so far only ostracized, not as yet punished. On second thoughts a better analogy might be Soviet Russia, an institution hated above all others by the average Russian. The problem is once the party gets into power it has it and will not give it up. Once you have boarded the flight, you have little influence on the pilot even if it is 500 against 1.</p>

		<p>Good article, but I have to disagree with the comment about the village being poor, dirty etc and how it took us 10,000 years to escape it. In fact, the village, rural traditional European life embodied by the peasant, has been the bedrock of European civilization, the reservoir of traditions and rooted customs. That is why both the communists and the liberal globalists have tried their best to destroy it, to reduce it to insignificance.</p>

		<p>One lesson that seems obvious is that it&rsquo;s easy to repress whatever &#8216;sub culture&rsquo; you find offensive, from the top.</p>
<p>If you can assure that the best people with the most balanced education get _great salaries_ for being loyal to their own (no &#8216;campaign contributions&rsquo;, no vote shopping for in-state programs by Reps or Senators of that state), you can control the destiny of your country.</p>
<p>Anything else begs a plurality approach to universalism, sweeping the legs out from under the majority by effectively _ignoring it_ in favor of vote-tipper secondary ethnies.</p>
<p>In this, it&rsquo;s clear that Democracy doesn&rsquo;t work because it relies on the considered support of the wealthy classes to enable candidates to reach the voters&rsquo; hands at all.</p>
<p>And they simply make sure that they own both sides of the choice.  It&rsquo;s just two people.  It&rsquo;s _cheap_.</p>
<p>If all candidates are bought and paid for with secret (traitorous) vs. public (frivolous) platforms that support specific commercial and class interests, so are all votes.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The Society expanded its political control even further by earning the loyalty of the city&rsquo;s ever-expanding immigrant community, which functioned as a base of political capital. The Tammany Hall ward boss or ward heeler – &#8220;wards&#8221; were the city&rsquo;s smallest political units from 1686 to 1938 – served as the local vote gatherer and provider of patronage. Beginning in late 1845, Tammany power surged with the influx of millions of Irish immigrants to New York. From 1872, Tammany had an Irish &#8220;boss,&#8221; and in 1928 a Tammany hero, New York Governor Al Smith won the Democratic presidential nomination. However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for graft and political corruption, perhaps most infamously under William M. &#8220;Boss&#8221; Tweed in the mid-19th century.<br>
&gt;</p>

<p>Multicult is a divide and conquer modification of Tammany Hall politics where the agenda (pro immigrant, &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; = pro power) is internalized within the institution as an **untouchable** topic that divides the voter base and prevents effective election of opposition.</p>
<p>But rather than rely on the immigrants via block party alcohol and ward patronage &#8216;assistance&rsquo; (the many morons = the mega bucks = the obvious betrayal) you simply control the few candidates, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The Elite always control the most by owning (absolutely) the fewest.  They are cheap that way and it limits their exposure-</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/4nAjl</p>
<p>To those &#8216;inside the ring&rsquo;.  Who are just as compromised by it&rsquo;s actions as their profits.</p>
<p>We cannot get past this without having a new nation with a new political system.  The present one is corrupted, absolutely, by it&rsquo;s  profiteering control over the candidacies.</p>

		<p>I really enjoyed reading this article from Jan. 2002.  I wish I had been receptive to such clear thinking back then.  As a musician (for many decades) I was sort of apolitical, having to deal with so many knee-jerk far-leftists every day &amp; night.  That year sort of started my personal turnaround.  I listened daily on NPR to the Senate hearings later that year re: Iraq, &amp; told other players at my gigs, &#8220;They are definitely going to start a war &amp; take down Saddam&#8221;.  Blah or no response.  Then later when the big &#8220;anti-war&#8221; rallies started up, the same cats were trying to tell me all about it.  The end of my posing as a liberal started in that year.  Now the phoniness of it all overwhelms me.  I even like Ann Coulter!</p>

		<p>I could not agree more with #7&rsquo;s last statement. A new nation! I often comment to friends and family that we (humanity) is trying to become more advanced than we are ready to accomplish.<br>
Essentially we are still nomadic and agrarian entities trying to reject our past. Much like a rural youth who moves to the city then lies about where they came from. They are ashamed of their family and past. I understand that it is because of our &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; advances that I am able to communicate with you now, but these advances are not needed as much as a return to our past. <br>

		<p>Multiculturalism is a tool used by the NWO to break down and destroy Western Civilization which will lead the way for one world government.  Same with promoting mass immigration and miscegenation.  The populations must first be diluted with foreigners to water down the national character and virtually erase national borders.  I believe this massive unfettered immigration of illegals into the US is one stage in this plan.  You can&rsquo;t merge the US, Mexico and Canada into the North American Union unless they all share the same population characteristics.  Canada&rsquo;s immigrant mix is different from the US in that Indians, Chinese and other Asians make up a bigger percentage of their population than in the US.  Look for Canada to import more Africans and Mexican immigration while the US will take in more Asians to balance things out.  Notice the recent uptick in Indians in America?  </p>

		<p>Multicultural hell is coming to Ireland also! Celebrating African Day in Limmerick.  Does anyone here still think there is not an INTENTIONAL global war on Whites all over the world? </p>
<p>http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local/limerick_prepares_for_africa_day_1_2659213</p>
<p>    <br>
   </p>
<p>&#8220;Family fun days, an African bazaar, public debates, food-tasting and sports activities are among the events taking place in Dublin, Limerick and Galway over the coming weeks to celebrate Africa Day 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ireland has developed strong connections with Africa over many years, not least those forged by Irish missionaries and non- governmental organisation. More recently, we have seen an increase in trade and business links, while many African communities here are making an invaluable contribution to Irish society,&rdquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
