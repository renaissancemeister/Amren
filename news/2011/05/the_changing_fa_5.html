			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 27, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By the year 2040, the majority of Americans will be people of colour  &mdash;  the minorities will have become the majority.</p>
<p>A fascinating new time-lapse map shows the increase in the non-white population across the decades.</p>
<p>It starts with 1990 and then predicts up to 2020, 2030 and 2040.</p>
<p>The map, titled the Map of America&rsquo;s Tomorrow, was produced by PolicyLink, a national research agency dedicated to social equity.</p>
<p>It illustrates what theroot.com calls the decade-by-decade &#8216;browning&rsquo; of America.</p>
<p>It is said to be the first visual representation of its kind of the country&rsquo;s racial future.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive term is used to describe ther growth of the populations of blacks, Hispanics/Latinos and Asians.</p>
<p>Angela Glover Blackwell, the Founder &amp; CEO of PolicyLink, said: &#8216;This map makes crystal clear just how dramatically the face of America is changing  &mdash;  and how quickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Already, nearly half of all young people are of color, and by 2040, people of color will become our nation&rsquo;s majority. </p>
<p>&#8216;Clearly, this snapshot of our future has struck a chord, leaving no doubt that we must invest in and start building the foundation of tomorrow&rsquo;s America today. Let&rsquo;s start now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The map, however, is causing some controversy.</p>
<p>One commenter said: &#8216;What a joke! This does not compare population density. This does not differentiate between Native Indians, Blacks, Mexican&rsquo;s, Chinese etc &hellip;  etc &hellip;  This is just some few people&rsquo;s wild guess put out for what reason!</p>
<p>&#8216;This map appears to me to be a hate stimulator. Nothing more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another commentator added: &#8216;I am Chinese American and I objected to the grouping under Asian as coloured &hellip; Chinese, Japanese and Koreans are not coloured. Our complexion is white if not whiter than caucasians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Blackwell said: &#8216;Today, nearly half of all children are kids of color.</p>
<p>&#8216;By definition, if they don&rsquo;t succeed, the nation won&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>&#8216;Many in the still-majority white population and political establishment don&rsquo;t see themselves reflected in the faces of America&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are talking far more about slashing Medicaid and education funding than investing in the dreams and needs of our children.</p>
<p>&#8216;Too many who have achieved success for themselves now want to pull up the ladder behind them.</p>
<p>&#8216;The results are obvious  &mdash;  people of colour are disproportionately saddled with high poverty rates, failing schools, poor health, and under-invested communities.</p>
<p>&#8216;But these challenges don&rsquo;t only affect communities of colour.</p>
<p>&#8216;White families that rely on the public education system struggle with these nationwide school budget squeezes. White college students are graduating with six-figure debt. &#8216;That&rsquo;s no way to run a country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two months ago new census maps and data was released showing the stark geographical divide between America&rsquo;s black and Hispanic populations as they become increasingly concentrated on opposite ends of the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. black and Hispanic populations are mostly concentrated in the South  &mdash;  but whereas the black population is centred in the Southeast, Hispanics are mostly in the Southwest.</p>
<p>The biggest general population rises were in the Southwest and Southeast, but the largest falls came in the Midwest, according to 2010 Census Bureau data.</p>
<p>Although Hispanics are concentrated in the Southwest, other areas of the South such as Alabama have posted significant gains in Hispanic population share.</p>
<p>In many South states, the Hispanic population has doubled on ten years ago, with Hispanics outstripping whites for the first time in New Mexico  &mdash;  46 to 40 per cent.</p>
<p>The Census 2010 statistics showed the number of Hispanics in the U.S. reached 50million in 2010, with one in every six Americans now a Latino.</p>
<p>They now represent 16 per cent of the U.S. population of 309 million.</p>
<p>Minority groups were behind an unprecedented 90 per cent of total U.S. population growth since 2000, due to immigration and higher Latino birth rates.</p>

		<p>Looks like I stay in the upper Midwest, where we still have clean water, trees, and other resources.  NAM triumphalists should keep in mind that current trends are not guaranteed to continue into the future.  They are assuming that the EBT card will always work.  They are unaware that YT can get along without them better than they can get along without YT.</p>

		<p>And now for my class project, my own &#8216;time lapse&rsquo; historigraph:</p>
<p>2015, Hydraulic and steam pressure recovery proving to be inadequate and uneconomical, Saudi Arabia announces they have been LYING about their petro reserves and are now post peak.  Petroleum production from their fields will now begin to lower by 2%, annually.</p>
<p>2016, China passes the U.S. in GDP with another 10% rise in annual energy use to go with.</p>
<p>2018, Iran announces they are a nuclear power and begins to sell her oil exclusively in Euro and Yuan.  The U.S. can do nothing about it because there are atomic equipped Iranian suicide teams in all the major United States cities, brought over in the 20 years of our defenseless southern borders.  And the world laughs at our spluttering outrage.</p>
<p>2020, China announces they are unpinning the RMB, interest rates spiral, first to 6 and then to 9 and then to 11%  The Fed cannot suppress it through market controls.  The U.S. economy, debt laden with a crashing currency value and skyrocketing inflation, crumbles.  The global elites cheer because their investment capital can now make them money again.</p>
<p>2021, China announces she will buy up, at a 1.25:1 offset, U.S. silver gold and copper bonds as well as currency stores, in trade for the USDs replacement with the Renminbi as their primary trade currency.  Oh, and there&rsquo;s this little thing called world government.  States with large holdings of U.S. bonds the world over demand an accounting from the U.S. Reserve and don&rsquo;t get it.  They take China&rsquo;s offer with a sigh of collective relief.  The U.S. government defaults and individual States start to issue their own currencies.</p>
<p>2022, U.S. elites, with their moneys long since safely beyond U.S. monetary transfer controls in overseas hedge funds, flee the nation in a stream of private and leased jets.</p>
<p>2023, we are alone with our ever-burgeoning &#8216;people of color&rsquo; who have no real job skills and are anything up to 70% population-wide dependent on non-existent government welfare in a currency that is no longer useful as anything but toilet paper.  Food riots break out across the nation as &#8216;migrant workers&rsquo; numbering in the MILLIONS clog the nations highways and fall upon smaller, self sufficient, farm holdings in the Midwest.  </p>
<p>2024, The Chinese step in, with the UN, offering &#8216;stabilization forces&rsquo; in trade for trades of _real property_.  It&rsquo;s not a &#8216;real choice&rsquo;, as the PLA are already on the west coast, backing up Asian landholders in California and Washington and Oregon.  Having long since blown our strategic petroleum reserve distributing food, it&rsquo;s just a polite notification of NWO globalist invasion.  The Navy is tied up at piers.  Jets cannot fly.  Troops cannot move by land over ruined highway system.  There is _no fuel_.</p>
<p>The USA ceases to exist.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br>
The dates and order may change.  But the events won&rsquo;t.  What people fail to understand is that &#8216;growth for it&rsquo;s own sake&rsquo; (high fertility, low brow) as a population metric is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Because when you follow a distributionist economic model, any upset in the availability of the root commodities which drive a society (oil = plastic, power, propulsion or &#8216;P3&rsquo;) can seriously, terminally, interrupt that societies functioning.</p>
<p>Commercial consumer product delivery that comes through multiple refinement, manufacutring and packaging stops from overseas slave cultures adds enormously to costs compared to delivery to a single point manufacture/distribtion -at- destination.</p>
<p>Hence, whatever the real cost, if your currency is worthless, you cannot afford to sustain yourself.</p>
<p>This is offsettable (through stringent frugality measures) in a small (on a global scale) population of 300 million with a high occurence of intelligence and a dominant, non-competitive (black and hispanic), non-insular, racial demography (whites share).  </p>
<p>There is no hope when the population overburden is one of the stupid, criminal and dependent, preying on those they unfairly see as being &#8216;responsible&rsquo; for their pathetic genetics.</p>
<p>And there is _no excuse_ when the reason for all of this comes down to virtual profit value as 1s and 0s for our own hyper intelligent.</p>
<p>For without the U.S. as a homeland and it&rsquo;s loyal population base as an army to hide behind, our elites will have no hope of survival in the big wide, bad, world.  Their 1s and 0s will be wiped out as western controls over banking and genetics research simultaneously slip and East Asians (who are generally smarter to begin with) become dominantly so.  And no longer need our elites either.</p>
<p>&#8216;What goes around&rsquo; is a lousy epitaph for the white race and the United States.  Because the white middle and working class _never wanted this_.  We still don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>PolicyLink and groups allied with it continually exhort Americans (read:  white Americans) to &#8220;prepare&#8221; for the future envisioned by 2042.  Ah, yes&hellip;PREPARE!! </p>
<p>My response is this:   There is nothing inevitable about this demographic tectonic shift.  It is happening, and with increasing speed, because people like Angela Glover Blackwell are working overtime to make it happen.  America&rsquo;s white-minority future is a product of self-fulfilling prophecy.  Those who tell us about the wonderful future projected by the Census Bureau are the very persons and groups busily manufacturing it.    </p>
<p>Of course, as we here already know, there isn&rsquo;t much wonderful about what awaits us. </p>

		<p>When we&rsquo;re the minority, I somehow doubt that we will be the recipients of government freebies which were handed to them when they were the minority. No indeed.  I&rsquo;m sure that affirmative action in all its unjust manifestation will still be the status quo. Besides, they will not be content with our minority status, but only with our ultimate extinction. </p>

		<p> It could be my imagination   &mdash;   or perhaps I am a typical &#8220;White racist&#8221;   &mdash;   but doesn&rsquo;t Angela Glover Blackwell look suspiciously like one of those wonderful &#8220;people of color&#8221; she&rsquo;s assuring us we&rsquo;re going to turn into, as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow?</p>
<p> Yes, I thought so. And as such, isn&rsquo;t there just a teeny-weeny chance that what she&rsquo;s trying to feed us is not the smug certainty that it appears to be on the surface; but wishful thinking? She WANTS us to lose our majority status; she WANTS us to miscegenate our way into oblivion as a race; and therefore, in her mind, the wish is father to the deed.</p>
<p> Well, when the liberal Democrats of the disastrous 1965-66 Congress passed the laws opening the immigration floodgates to anyone who didn&rsquo;t have a White face, they assured us it would make very little difference in the actual numbers. They were oh, so wrong, as we all know, much to our dismay. Or perhaps they were lying to us, and laughing up their sleeve as they did so, which is more likely.</p>
<p> Who knows what might happen between now and 2042? Yes, the dark people may out-illegal immigrate and out-breed us enough to become the majority; but then again, maybe that won&rsquo;t happen. I, for one, am not prepared to follow the advice of some self-hating White liberals, which could be summed up as: &#8220;We&rsquo;re whipped, boys, so we might as well just lie down and let them walk all over us.&#8221; No, thank you; nobody&rsquo;s walking on me!</p>

		<p>The Naïve branch of the diversity lobby celebrates mathematics when it comes to population trends. This same group of people denies mathematics when it comes to economics.   But mathematics are far more applicable to economics than they are to population trends. </p>

		<p>I like what the Asian guy said. Basically, to this black girl, &#8216;doon&rsquo;t speak for me&rsquo;is what he&rsquo;s saying. Who could blame the guy? I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be lumped in with blacks, either. If I were Arabs, I would want my heritage mentioned. They identify with blacks much more than White. As for Hispanics, they will NEVER side with Glover Blackwell&rsquo;s ilk either. I have much more hope for the Spanish speakers than the ebonics speakers. </p>

		<p>If this simulation uses the US census definition of white its off, because the census includes a lot of non whites in the white numbers. The turn over point is actually happening right about now, and by 2042 whites - real native European only ancestry Americans - will be a 20-25% minority. </p>

		<p>#2 The USN submarine fleet is 100% nuclear powered. There will be no hard Chinese invasion of the USA in 2024. Sea denial is easier than sea control. The Chinese are pragmatic, why spend money on taking something when you can buy it for a much lower sum in the future from corrupt American officials and companies?</p>
<p>The American standard of living is artificially elevated way above where it should be by the status of the dollar. Remove that and USA becomes the third world economy it really is, and that&rsquo;s where the trends point. USA cannot afford an arms race with China, and if it tries to race anyway, it will just hasten its own downfall. </p>

		<p>The assumption is that white folks will remain placid little do gooders, aborting their  children for sport and sucking up yet more dope every day. They might just grow up, on the other hand, taking control from the liberal elite and turning the tide by inviting in all the Euro white folks who want to come here . It&rsquo;s up to us . <br>
It could look very different you see, if only we could wake the kids up from their slumber.</p>

		<p>If you want to read a real horror story, take a leisurely stroll through the UN population statistics and their projections. Also go back to your old high school studies and find John B. Calhoun&rsquo;s study on population stresses. What happens to people when the do-gooders of the world keep feeding them without stretching their countries to accommodate the extra masses.What happens in a country like Yemen, 1950 population 4.3 million, currently about 22 and projected to be 84.4 million in 2050. Libya, then 1 and now 7 million. Pakistan, Iraq, Iran,Syria have all quadrupled their populations since 1950, those millions that have flooded the West and tried to make that a home away from home are but a drop in the bucket from the ravening hordes left back at home. The current financial crisis has just shown them that their governments just cannot cope with that level of population. That is the cause of all this demand for &#8220;freedom&#8221;.<br>
They don&rsquo;t want democracy, they want food and shelter and jobs and they don&rsquo;t have it. The protests in Iran were not triggered by a desire for democracy, they were triggered by a 30% unemployment rate when the government is cutting down on subsidies. All these governments are subsidizing the basics of life, from cooking oil to to rice to gas and when they can&rsquo;t afford it the balloon goes up. The Saudis have announced a new government plan to give 100 billion, in houses, employment, anything, they are the only ones who can afford to stay in power.<br>
The problem in Yemen in not Saleh, the problem with Yemen is that their oil reserves are finished. According to the UN, apart from Russia and Eastern Europe the only countries without further population growth are North Korea and Zimbabwe. Two governments that have totally failed and whose starvation is managing to overcome the natural birth rate.</p>
<p>Europe is surrounded by countries whose main land mass is desert, incapable of supporting the populations they breed. They do not have enough money to cure that problem, they can put their foot down now or be trampled underfoot in the very near future.</p>
<p>In the same time that the states went from a population of 150  to 300 million, Mexico went from 27 to 120 million, and that&rsquo;s not counting the 10-15 million that are in the states. Mexico is about as close to failure as a state can get, what do you think will happen when the narcos take over the government they don&rsquo;t already own.<br>

		<p>America, or rather a majority White America is done for.  I have no doubt that the majority of the people in what is now the continental United States will be non-White by the year 2050.  I also have no doubt that the United States will cease to exist as a nation at around the same time, give or take a decade or so. I just do not see conservative, pro-American Whites living as a denigrated minority in any such majority-colored version of a future United States. With that in mind, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it is best if we enhance racial separatism in the minds of Hispanics or Black Americans, as the sooner the nation breaks apart along ethno/race lines, the better it will be for us.</p>

<p> As I suspected and been saying since the 70&rsquo;s. New England and upper Great Lake states will afford a sense of reprieve for whites outside the metros. It&rsquo;s comforting to know that whites will continue to dominate, percentage wise, the ex-urban and rural demograhics just like present.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t underestimate the effectiveness the snowbelt has on keeping black and brown numbers in check. If it wasn&rsquo;t for liberal and minority urban enclaves like Minneapolis, Detroit or Buffalo and their bleeding heart welfare systems. From Maine to Minnesota, our cities would once again, have a racial composition much more reflective of these regions as a whole.<br>
 <br>
The south and southwest is a lost cause unfortunately. Proximity to Mexico and a historically black region has dealt whites down there a raw deal.</p>

		<p>Call it what it is&hellip; The third worlding of America, brought to you by the two major political parties, both looking for cheap labor and one looking for cheap votes.   </p>
<p>The first symptoms are already here, the degradation of our schools, the faltering of the rule of law, the space program being cancelled, never to return.   The hope of mankind&rsquo;s future is being snuffed out of existence by a group of fools who won&rsquo;t be happy until every single person on the planet has black hair, brown skin, brown eyes, and a two digit IQ.  And until every country is run by a psychotic, arrogant tyrants who will kill anybody with an original thought. </p>

<p>Indeed, Miss Blackwell!!! But what you and your fellow cheerleaders of minority population growth fail to realize is the fact that the failure of so many blacks and browns is rooted in their genetics. The evidence supporting this is voluminous; if you have any doubt I suggest you consult Herrnstein and Murray&rsquo;s &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; or the Phillipe Rushton and Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s article &#8220;Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I guess the liberals figure that if they just wish hard enough for this, it will all come to pass!  And, to them, one drop of non-white blood designates a person of color, regardless of how that person sees himself.  No matter if the non-whites become completely subsumed in a sea of white, we&rsquo;ll still have one big mass of people of color who will vote Democratic  &mdash;  or better yet Socialist or Communist.  <br>
I grew up in WV with a lot of folks who had some Native American ancestry  &mdash;  Cherokee mostly.  Sometimes one couldn&rsquo;t tell by looking, and sometimes it was obvious.  But they still identified as white, and no one disputed them.  It occurred to no one that I ever knew that this little bit of native ancestry made a person non-white.  <br>
Yesterday, while grocery shopping, I observed a married couple and their two little kids.  The husband was clearly white and the wife a light-skinned black woman.  The children were almost white.  Now, is it a good chance that these kids will grow up to marry white people and have offspring that will definitely &#8220;pass&#8221;?  Both parents appeared attentive and loving, so will their children hate whites and love blacks or vice versa?  They will likely become subsumed in a sea of white people.  <br>
All these theories about increasing brown and black folks always assume that there will be no assimilation of any kind, whether it&rsquo;s genetic or cultural.  They never observe the fact that blacks are not growing, percentage-wise, in any significant number or that browns may change their attitudes concerning large families.  Laws are already beginning to turn against illegals, and it&rsquo;s likely that lack of jobs  &mdash;  either due to such laws or a worsening economy  &mdash;  will discourage more immigration.  Money is also growing scarcer for welfare.<br>
The left wants all of us to intermarry, of course.  But don&rsquo;t they see what this would result in?</p>

<p>When Whites are in the minority, there will be even MORE discrimination against and open hostility toward Whites.  The term &#8220;minority&#8221; is and always has been just another euphemism for &#8220;lesser achieving race.&#8221;  It really means nothing in terms of who receives &#8220;extra-help.&#8221;  Asians are minorities, yet they (for the most part) do not require preferences for jobs, loans, or college admissions.  They often have so many highly qualified applicants among their ranks that they are actually discriminated against (along w/ whites) in areas where they are numerous.  In fact, in the news recently was an elite NYC high school criticized for a lack &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;minority participation&#8221;, despite half the enrollment being Asian.   </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think many Whites, even those disposed to agree with us, fully appreciate what is in store for us when we get past the tipping point.  See South Africa for a relevant preview.</p>

		<p>There are many scenarios which a multicultural America will face.  This country (America) was given to us (European Americans/Europeans) by our Founding Fathers (European Americans/Europeans); this IS our country.  However, the government is not ours; the regime has mutated into an anti-European American/European evil menace.  </p>
<p>When the 1965 Immigration and Nationalization Act was passed by the politicians, the coffin lid began to descend upon us.  Alas, the time to betray a people is when times are good.  In 1965 European Americans/Europeans were busy making money, raising families, barbequing in the back yard, etc.  In 1965 European Americans/Europeans trusted that their government would do what is best for them; however, this same government stabbed them in the back with this infamous, treasonous act (the 1965 Immigration and Nationalization Act).  Read the books by the White Nationalist Doug Eiderzen.  They are good, solid books that do show a direction and plan for the European American/European.</p>
<p>What is taking place in America is also taking place in all Caucasian lands and areas (Europe, Canada, Australia, etc.).  What is certain reality follows: we have people of color flooding into our country unhindered by a complacent government; we have invaders in our country determined to take revenge on all European Americans/Europeans; and we have a government that is quite against the European American/European.  Make no mistake about it, the above is a catalyst for our annihilation.                <br>

		<p>Poster #18 mentiones how cold weather keeps black/brown numbers down.  I work around a LOT of latinos.  They hate the winters Here in the northeast.  Every last one of them talks about moving to Florida or California or Texas in the near future.</p>
<p>Another poster mentioned they have hope for latinos over ebonics speakers.  I know and work around latinos all day long.  10% of them are white or nearly so, and they do a great job of learning english and assimilating.  As for the Dominicans, I would send 95% of them back to their island in a heartbeat.  South Americans tend to be much better.  Mexicans are 50/50 good or bad.  They may provide us a great buffer zone to keep the blacks out, but not all of them assimilate.  </p>

<p>First, high yella mulattoes are still mulattoes. White mental traits appears to be recessive judging by the first generation half breeds I have seen. These kids will want to act black even if they almost can pass for white. </p>
<p>Second, while some blacks and browns may adjust their family size downwards, others wont, and their kids will carry on the family legacy in the next generation, and swamp their slower breeding brethren. </p>
<p>African blacks live incredibly impoverished and violent lives and they still have tons of children. They have been darwinistically selected for having the ability to quickly expand their numbers even in adverse conditions. The only thing that will stop them is a total absence of food. And if it becomes that bad in USA, then its pretty much game over for american society. </p>
<p>By the way, you have a misconception about the numbers of black people. While their numbers havent grown measured as a percentage of total population, the total population has grown by about 50% since the 50s, and therefore the amount of blacks will have grown as much just to keep up. The amount of actual non racially mixed, european ancestry only white people has been slowly declining since the 50&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>The real problem in all of this is that this is exactly what the Federal government wants. Since the 1965 immigration act, it has been getting more clear by the day that the federal government wants the white race to disappear; completely, totally and with absolutely no chane of ever coming together again. <br>
 The white &#8220;elites&#8221; think that they will be spared and sit at the top of the food chain. This is the major flaw in their plan. When the white race is cut down to small enough numbers, the &#8220;people of color&#8221; will turn on them as well.</p>

I&rsquo;m aware that many people disagree with my assessments regarding demographic forecasts.  However, I think the bare numbers regarding IQ and race are very clear.  Pure blacks have an average IQ of 70.  Mulattoes (designated &#8220;coloreds&#8221; in Africa) have an average of 85.  <br>
I agree that American blacks have increased their numbers per se, but so have American whites.  We still make up a large majority percentage-wise and should not just throw up our hands in despair.</p>

Haven&rsquo;t you noticed that mulatto&rsquo;s (like Obama) ALWAYS go with and side with their black part? ALWAYS! 90% of them always hate their White side and turn on the White parent that raised them for heaven&rsquo;s sake!</p>
<p>BTW, percentage wise the black population is growing FASTER than the White population. Just because the White population consists of MORE people right now means nothing. How many White kids do you see born compared to black kids being born?</p>
<p>You honestly think the browns will quit having large families and quit coming here because of the lack of jobs??? </p>
<p>BTW, most of us do not want ASSIMILATION of these people, period. Have you not noticed that most LEGAL hispanics are all for their OWN race and not for what is good for us or our country?  We want them out of our country. </p>

Olewhitelady, you must have a very limited experience up there in West Virginia!  Gawd! Do you advocate miscegenation as the solution to the race problem?  That is EXACTLY what the extreme left advocates too.  You cannot be a white nationalist if you cling to the belief that other races can be assimilated into ours, and we sill still be white. </p>
<p>As anon.#33 said (very correctly), &#8220;high yeller mulattoes are still mulattoes.&#8221; They are not white. </p>
<p>And, &#8220;you have a misconception about the numbers of black people. While their numbers haven&rsquo;t grown as a percentage of the total population, the total population itself <b>has grown by about 50% </b>since the 50s;  therefore the number of blacks has grown just as much in order to keep up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, it has grown massively, while the number of true whites has been declining.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s the stupidest argument I&rsquo;ve ever heard.  White means European not skin tone.  Just because you can bleach out your yellow skin tone doesn&rsquo;t make you Europeans.  What bothers me the most is that the people that are pouring in here from non-European countries come from places that have a lower standard of excellence.  It&rsquo;s so obvious when you&rsquo;ve lived in an overwhelmingly White area and drive into a majority minority area.  I had never been to California before and I was visiting Los Angeles about 10 years ago and got off the freeway downtown to get some gas and I was shocked at the landscape of the area.  The neighborhoods were shabby and surreal and I never would have guessed I was looking at an area inside the US if someone had shown me a picture of it.  I&rsquo;ve seen this pattern in every place I&rsquo;ve ever been in this country and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what part of the country it&rsquo;s in, West, Southwest, the Deep South, etc., it all looks the same.  Black areas are by far the worst and at least Mexicans can still run a nominally functioning society but make no mistake it&rsquo;s several notches down from Western standards. When America was 90 percent White it could easily manage the black population but now were being dragged down with all the third worlders living here.  </p>

<p>Have you ever been out of West Virginia?    W. Va. is NOT typical of the USA!  Take a trip to California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Florida.   That&rsquo;s where the population is.   Do you honestly think whites &#8220;make up a large majority percentage-wise&#8221; THERE? </p>
<p>No, I definitely do not advocate throwing up our hands in despair. But I do advocate being realistic (which you are not).<br>

		<p>Anonymous #2. That is perhaps one of the most depressing things I&rsquo;ve ever read. But it&rsquo;s really not too far fetched. China, for all of its incompatabilities with Western Civilization, understands that dealing with society&rsquo;s troublemakers strictly &amp; swiftly, is the only way for the greater society to succeed. Also, China will be much more obligatory towards European blood than African blood. And you see how China deals with their Muslim population. If they become a threat to the Han majority, they &#8220;disappear&#8221;. When was the last time that the White majority in the good ol&rsquo; USA was prtected by the people voted in wgho are supposed to be looking out for our best interests. </p>
<p>And to the poster who claims that blacks &amp; Mestizos do not like cold weather. That is true up here in Ohio, a Great Lake state. Here in Cleveland, the police blotter is through the roof May thru September. The cold months are a little more civilized. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that the ruling class elites of both parties turned on N.England &amp; the Great Lake states because we have the most segregated neighborhoods in the country. For 30+ years our good-paying jobs have been leaving for warmer climes &amp; cheaper labor of the Southeast. Well, I&rsquo;ll always take my chances on finding a decent paying job and living separate from blacks any day. It&rsquo;s not personal. It&rsquo;s genetic. It&rsquo;s common sense.</p>

<p>you can rant all you want to, how many people agree with you? <br>
I just did a google search on the stand of all major christian denominations on diversity and interracial marriage. They all think it is wonderful. The only one not coming out crystal clear was the Pentecostal church. <br>
Interracial mixing is pushed on all sides, and God is all in favor of it. According to them. You and I are getting older and the young people are so brainwashed, it will take some major pain for them to wake up and what are they going to do then?  They are so dumbed down and clueless already. When I last went to town, a small town that is, I saw three mixed couples in Wal-Mart, several at Golden Corral. One older white woman had all she could do fawning over a mixed baby.  <br>
If nobody teaches the white kids some real history there is little chance that they are going to see the light. </p>

<p>&ldquo;2022, U.S. elites, with their fortunes long since safely beyond U.S. monetary transfer controls in overseas hedge funds, flee the nation in a stream of private jets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>*I also agree with post #34, the non-Whites WILL turn on these useful idiot elites. By 2022 probably EVERY White nation will be over run and/or controlled by non-Whites, you can see it taking shape right now not only here but in Europe, Australia and Canada. So where will they run to? Just who do you think will be controling those overseas hedge funds? As the elite disembark their private jets, the non-White rulers will just inform them that their fortunes now belong to &#8220;the people&#8221; and, if not shot on the spot, will be handed a hoe and told to go work the fields.     </p>

<p>Ah excuse me Comrade Blackwell, but isn&rsquo;t it fair to say that those who have built the ladder, are entitled to do whatever they like with it? What a pity that they don&rsquo;t want you swinging from the bottom of the thing, hooting and chirping about how many rungs of the ladder you &ldquo;be owed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I give this country of ours about 2 decades before it either breaks apart into a northern confederation of states that is mostly to all white, and a southern region that is a &ldquo;paradise of color;&rdquo; or we just have an outright race war, that the whites eventually win but lose about 10 to 15 percent of our population in the process. Of course, the liberal elites and Wall Street sharks will be fleeing the carnage for Australia or New Zeeland (just like most of the rich white traitors in South Africa did) yammering and mewling about, &ldquo;what went wrong.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In the end, I remain optimistic that whites will overcome this crisis, in one of these two ways. The larger question is, will we have the guts and brains to never repeat this mistake again in the future generations to come?</p>

<p>I live in Buffalo and I often wonder why Puerto Ricans are flooding New York. Yes, it has a great deal to do with liberal welfare benefits but I have yet to see or hear any Hispanics complain about the weather any more than the native whites.</p>
<p>The same with the Somalians they&rsquo;re bringing in and other Hispanic groups.</p>
<p>I wish weather was the answer but it isn&rsquo;t. Non-whites will move to anywhere whites are regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>If whites cut off their money, some would leave but even without welfare, the benefits of living with whites far out weighs weather and welfare.<br>

		<p>@13,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
#2 The USN submarine fleet is 100% nuclear powered.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Try putting together a cruise crew and 60 days of rations plus 20 Mk.48s and AGM-84 or, if you&rsquo;re really desperate, Tridents as well as all the spares and maintenance on _no gas_.  Try getting reliable ASST to sort the sheep from the goats as the Chinese come in on standard container shipments.</p>
<p>And the Chinese will be there too.  The incident with the Battle Cat and the Song class was just the opening shot in the &#8216;look what we can do!&rsquo; shifting of power.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
There will be no hard Chinese invasion of the USA in 2024.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>They will be welcomed in by a nation which looks at it&rsquo;s 350 million starving neighbors and decides that it&rsquo;s better to be owned than dead.</p>
<p>And with the control over STRATCOM/NORCOMs nuclears up in the air (no longer on the boat or in the silo) it will be hard to say &#8216;no&rsquo; if the globalists have decided that &#8216;World Control&rsquo; over nuclear forces is a better ideal to follow.</p>
<p>Not to mention the unknowable damage being done to our electronic infrastructure from the vast and ever increasing sophistication of &#8216;overseas&rsquo; IW attacks.</p>
<p>Out with a whimper.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Sea denial is easier than sea control.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Without doubt.  But if you are doing urban pacification, there is no need for heavy mechanized forces which means you can get away with air transfer and mateup with light mech, in theater.  Especially if your currency owns all the POL.</p>
<p>A post-oil USN would have a _very hard_ time &#8216;denying&rsquo; all Western Port access, From Canada to Venezuela, especially if the threat came in on civilian traffic, as it did in Norway in 1940.</p>
<p>And again, we might be begging them to come.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The Chinese are pragmatic, why spend money on taking something when you can buy it for a much lower sum in the future from corrupt American officials and companies?<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Because the Chinese know when to jump in to be first.  Think squatters rights and Oklahoma in 1889.  The Chinese know that if they want to have open access to the American interior as a means to alleviate population mass and control real property in the U.S., they have to have a coast and several ports under their thumb to make it a fait de accompli.  Especially as the nation fragments, ethnically, they will buy their way in.<br>
 <br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
The American standard of living is artificially elevated way above where it should be by the status of the dollar. Remove that and USA becomes the third world economy it really is, and that&rsquo;s where the trends point.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Even third world nations do business.  In fact, if you look at Africa, that&rsquo;s the way the Chinese prefer it.  Buy ONE man, give him enough money to own his own elites (eliminate the competition through inclusiveness) and then let them do whatever they need to to &#8216;secure and stabilize&rsquo; their own population without you&rsquo;re having to be part of the mess.  All while creating no-go zones as Chinese Enclaves around specific asset resources they want to control.</p>
<p>The notion that the Chinese want blacks to &#8216;help them&rsquo; in their exploitation of African lumber and mineral resources is laughable.  Just read what African workers have to say about their new master&rsquo;s habits.</p>
<p>It will be no different here.  Which is why _being white and being close together_ is so important.  Because blacks and hispanics will sell each other right into a noose.  But whites will hold.  If we have control over the heartland and a reason to hope.  The gulf states and the Great Lakes will be our outlet to the world.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
USA cannot afford an arms race with China, and if it tries to race anyway, it will just hasten its own downfall.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>We certainly cannot afford a conventional arms race with a threat that has ASBMs, OTH-B and Surface Wave naval targeting and the will to nuclear armed systems on CVSFs 1,000nm or more out to sea.  Not least because China&rsquo;s interior is 4,500 miles deep and they can afford a direct exchange on coastal facilities.</p>
<p>However; this does not mean we can afford to yield even parity with the Chinese while our R&D; is sold off and our force metrics decline.</p>
<p>U.S. innovation (HTV-2 Falcon/Blackswift) is the right direction to go because if properly synergized as a theater strategic (no Mach-20 shapes out of CONUS) weapons sytem it can hostage China&rsquo;s inner industrial cities from very oblique flyby conditions.  And be untouchable with as few as 50 airframes for the same program cost as a single CVN-78 Ford.</p>
<p>Slinging rods from god like skipped stones off a TAV puts all conventional ideals of &#8216;air defense&rsquo; on their heels.</p>
<p>And forcing the Chinese to match the new paradigm also forces the Chinese to spend money they could otherwise direct towards their own conventional force posture.  Which I agree, we can no longer attempt to match.</p>

<p>Although, I don&rsquo;t think the Asians will in fact take over. They&rsquo;re going into a demographic death spiral even worse than most whites. They&rsquo;re just a few decades behind us. East Asian fertility of 1.4 vs. white American fertility of 1.8 will eventually show.</p>

		<p>These numbers are based on Census data that counts anyone physically in the country regardless of their status. The numbers are greatly skewed by a large number of illegals that range, if you can believe our own government, 11 million to independent estimates of 20 or 30 million.  If a foreign student comes to the US from some third world dump in Asia or Africa and studies at one of our universities they are counted in the population. If someone is here on a temporary visa and the Census conducts the census during their stay they are added to the population.  There are too many variables about what will happen in the future to know the outcome. It depends whether the government gets serious about cracking down on illegals and doing something about birthright citizenship, the likelihood of foreign students returning to their countries of origin after graduation, a possible reduction in legal immigration, the number of immigrants who leave the country or retire back home where the cost of living is cheaper and a whole lot of other variables.  I will say this.  When you subtract the illegals and green card holders that don&rsquo;t have US citizenship your left with an American citizen White population percentage that is hovering somewhere in the range of 75-77 percent. So you see the problem can be taken care of quite easily by getting the right people in government and it can be done nice and constitutional like without a fascist government in power.     </p>

Asians do not hate whites&hellip;&hellip; they are similar to us. they know there are good and bad whites. My wife is Korean and her family accepts me as one of them&hellip;&hellip;. they have a mistrust of blacks, but usually give everyone a chance to prove whether they are fools or not.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Oh, come on! Your wife&rsquo;s family may accept you because YOU are married to her! That does not mean they accept WHITES as a whole! <br>
BTW, I am sick of those of you who have a different race spouse who ALWAYS tries to make the rest of us think their race is on OUR side! NO, THEY ARE NOT AND NEVER WILL BE. Which side will YOU be on when the time comes? Make no mistake, because that is one problem a mixed race couple will have in the near future. You will more than likely have to choose the Asian side, if there will even be a &#8220;choice&#8221; left open to you. </p>
<p>Sorry to say it, but you should have known this before marrying someone of another race. Most of us, not all, are against interracial relationships as it dilutes the White race. That is my concern and only concern when it comes to my race.</p>

<p>&#8220;you forget 2 important things :</p>
<p>1. Russia and the US are still &amp; will always be the biggest enemies despite race. Plus Russia is weak economically and as a Russian myself, we cannot afford a war.</p>
<p>2. China has enough Nuke arsenal&hellip;add to the fact that they are economically stronger than either nation ( Russia &amp; USA) plus they know all the military secrets of the US. They got the best spy network and technology agencies.</p>
<p>The factor of economics is very important in war. A weak balkanized bankrupt Russia is incompetent infront of China. Also, America is growing weaker by the day. In a few decades China &amp; Nuclear India could easily conquer the west. Infact, I would&rsquo;nt be surprised if Russia actually takes their side to enable the fall of the west. Thats what the soviets and Bolsheviks wanted from so long. &#8220;</p>
<p>Valuable insights, without a doubt.  Just one thing I want to toss in;  Although both sides give much credit to the idea that the U.S. and Russia are big enemies, we have never fought a war against the other.  There are many Russians in the U.S., and long have been - my grandparents were from Russia.  I question whether Russia would really want to kill so many of their own or of Russian descent.</p>
<p>Assessing the true basic Russian hatred of the West is important.  But Russia historically seems to have wished to emulate the West, not destroy it.  In fact, China currently seems to wish to emulate the West.  Chinese women are getting surgeries to look more white.  IF they hate us, it is out of jealousy, which is a pretty childish reason to destroy something.</p>

They are poor, hungry and thirsty, so for them, pretty much anywhere is better than wherever they are now.  The White world accepts such refugees and we pay to bring them in.  They will continue to come even if we suffer economic disaster as just having hope for a consistent supply of food and water is enough for many to want to be here.</p>

<p>Of course it will happen.  That is the threat. And that is exactly why we need separation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it not only WILL happen, but it iS happening, and HAS BEEN happening for centuries already.  Left uncontrolled,  <br>
we will end up looking like a mulatto nation such as the Dominican republic. Would you want that?  Do you consider them &#8220;white&#8221;?</p>

<p>I consider them <i>predominantly </i> white (since you ask). But Amerindians are a long way (genetically)  from African blacks, and their numbers are very small; they would make a small genetic dent.  No one here has been mentioning them but you. They cannot be taken as analogous to blacks.</p>

<p>I doubt it. Russia and the USA have never actually been at war. And, while it is true there is still some residual distrust from the Soviet years, as they recede into history, most white Americans (especially younger ones) are coming to view Russia as just another large European country, like Britain, France, or Germany.</p>

		<p>Jared Taylor, having grown up in Japan, (and speaking their language) may know a thing or two about Asian culture. I have never heard him allude to the fact that Asians &#8220;hate&#8221; the white race. If anyone should be considered an expert on this topic it would be him. Sure the Japanese are probably different than the Chinese or other Eastern Asian groups, but probably not enough to radically alter the basic premise.</p>
<p>With that being said and as a white man, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m in any hurry to make babies with them or welcome them into our country in vast numbers. They have their race/culture and we have ours. I think they for the most part accept this and we should as well.</p>

		<p>The notion that East Asians &#8216;hate&rsquo; whites is ridicolous. East Asians are probably pretty indifferent to our fate, they neither hate nor love us.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t invade and &#8216;clean up&rsquo; America, and why would they want America? The Chinese are pragmatic. They will see America as a country that needs to be managed and kept stable, like North Korea, rather than go in and commit genocide like some loons here are advocating.</p>
<p>Nontheless, the true face of American whites are probably already down to 50 % in the general population. If you discount arabs, central asians who are counted as &#8216;white&rsquo; in the census, as well as add the 20-30 million illegals according to independent estimates, then you get 52-53 %. But this is the entire population.</p>
<p>If you look at under 18, the picture is around 35 %.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already a minority in America. The question now is the end game, &#8216;turning it around&rsquo; is already too late. Will we have racial partition, a Brazilian-like society(which I find unlikely) or civil war?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually leaning towards civil war(which won&rsquo;t be started by whites), but will come after an economic shock paired with an ecological shock(oil production, google &#8216;Peak Oil&rsquo;).</p>
<p>In the end, a lot of whites may flee but most have family here and even white liberals love this country a lot. And a lot of them will either despair in private at how their delusions failed to materialise, and the rest will probably be buthered by blacks/latinos or used as pawns by them, and the others will probably be subdued or buthered by white patriots.</p>
<p>Still, Whites hold all the cards. If you discount AA generals, the army is overwhelmingly white and Christian. America has loads of guns, and a highly militarised population. America has been in near constant war for the last 6 decades and there&rsquo;s plenty of army experience and genuine bonding between white men because of this. There are loads of veterans too.</p>
<p>And furthermore, all the agriculture, most of the major companies(aside from financial one&rsquo;s, perhaps, but who cares about investestment banking when the country&rsquo;s in flames?) and just about all the experts on matters such as nuclear power to boatbuilding are all white. We have still a big population, the establishment is saturated of us, we have all the experts on all the major areas to run a society.</p>
<p>And for all the &#8216;asian scare&rsquo;, they are still only 5 % of the population and most of them will side with whites(for survival if for nothing else) and hardly with blacks. Remember the LA race riots in the early 1990s? Koreans and Blacks had quite a few encounters there. There is a similar situation in Paris, where there is a big minority of Chinese people, who are demonstrating against the violence and thuggery of african and arab behaviour(and they got attacked during their demonstration too).</p>
<p>The asians will side with us in the dark hour, some out of genuine affection, other&rsquo;s because they view us much more favourably compared to blacks or latinos, even if they don&rsquo;t hold a genuine affection they are still pragmatic.</p>
<p>The problem will not be the awakening, the problem will be the end game. How will you solve the problem of America, and increasingly Europe and Australia too? Expel 20-50 % of the population? They will never accept that, nor will countries like Somalia take them in. </p>
<p>The only way to solve the problem will be partition, or if you want to have the whole of America, some sort of apartheid(which will be unsustainable). A permanent solution will be genocide, but is anyone actually advocating that? Good luck with agenda.</p>
<p>The Western world&rsquo;s decline will be gradual, even if we fight back, simply because we are outnumbered and they have much higher birth rates. And the only real way to solve this is to do unspeakable things. So no matter how you put it, from on here the time of harmony is over and we are only left with options ranging from bad to worse.</p>

<p>Perhaps it appears to you to be that way.  At the moment, most whites have an escape hatch:  An American, British or Canadian passport and a modicum of protection from their respective governments.  When those passports become worthless pieces of paper and whites are unwelcome in the US,  any white that finds himself under Asian rule, will learn quickly as to how &#8220;kind&#8221; and &#8220;gentle&#8221; those Asians are.</p>

<p>what have you been doing in Asia?  Why should they have been disdainful to you? You come with money in hand and they bow and smile and take it, or whatever it is you bring that they need and want. <br>
WHAT are Chinese children learning in school about us, like about the late 19th century and on?  We, like Ron Paul said, forget what we have done to them, but they don&rsquo;t forget. <br>
How many of you here have had an attitude that because it is the wonderful Americans, they have the right to march into any country and throw their military weight around?  You should have stayed home and taken care of your own problems, instead of creating a pile big enough that you won&rsquo;t be able to handle it. <br>
A nation that disregards the wisdom of their founders, who were among the greatest thinkers of the world, does not deserve any better. <br>
They learn Bible verses by heart, but not the Constitution. I helped with summer Bible school a couple of years ago and the children  learned about Queen Esther!!!!.   Who decides things like that? who decides what gets put into little children&rsquo;s minds?  <br>
Between the liberals and the Christians this country is between a rock and a hard place. Except nobody says anything about the detrimental effect churches have on this land.  <br>

		<p>I think whites in this country  are going to have to prepare for a Yugoslavia type situation that is going to happen before 2040. People had better prepare themselves mentally for bloodshed and loosing everything they worked for and starting over. New borders will be formed and new nations. What was once an experiment in liberty and freedom is now a long failed egalitarian state. Racial conscious whites will have their state with the laws designed to preserve a white majority perpetually and a multicultural egalitarian state where everyone in the third world will have a right to be there.  Nature will assert itself not any government. It will happen. This country is not exempt from what goes on in the rest of the world.</p>

		<p>As the East Asian juggernaut continues the ethnocentric ethos will deepen its hold on the psyches of multicultural states in decline. The victors always write the histories. Those states on the way to victory tend to be more influential than others. People notice &#8220;winners&#8221; as the great American philosopher Charlie Sheen said.<br>
The Chinese won&rsquo;t invade America, for obvious reasons only those addicted to Tom Clancy can&rsquo;t figure out. They are entering the colonial phase; colonizing powers seek out underdeveloped, weak  areas. That means Africa. What the world will see over the next century is biowarfare on a very large and frightening scale&hellip; if the media can figure out it really is intentional and not just an outbreak of a new naturally occurring virus or bacterial plague. Otherwise it simply goes down as another bad disease.<br>
 China really needs the land and resources and native Africans simply cannot muster the defenses to keep them out.</p>

<p>No, they will demand proportional repesentation. If whites are 25% of the population, no more than 25% of all employees may be whites, so that society is accurately mirrored. The census will then understate the amount of whites as much as it overstates it now. </p>

<p><br>
We can stop this projected trend, if we wanted to, by repealing the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, and then by deporting all of those here Illegally from Mexico, and other points around the world. </p>
<p>It would be refreshing to have a Government that respected and worked within the framework of our Constitution, and abided by their duty to protect our coasts and borders from Illegal invasions. </p>
<p>English should be recognized formally, as our National language, and all Goverment business, from the local Town Hall, to the Halls of Congress, shall only operate in English. </p>
