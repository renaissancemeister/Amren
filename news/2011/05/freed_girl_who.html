<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lorraine Mbulawa was found not guilty of attempted murder but was charged with the lesser offence of unlawful wounding</p>
<p>A young woman who repeatedly stabbed her mother as she slept has walked free from court after a judge accepted she believed she was acting on the instructions of evil spirits.</p>
<p>Lorraine Mbulawa, 20, donned dark clothes, gloves and a home-made balaclava and attacked her mother with a kitchen knife in Braunstone Firth, Leicester.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old victim saved herself by grabbing the weapon, but suffered serious face and arm injuries.</p>
<p>Mbulawa, who was 18 at the time, was cleared of attempted murder at her trial at Leicester Crown Court earlier this year but convicted of unlawful wounding.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists said she was not mad and the jury agreed that she knew what she was doing.</p>
<p>However, the A-level student, who was born in Zimbabwe, escaped with a 12-month suspended prison sentence and was ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work.</p>
<p>Passing sentence on Monday, Mr Justice Keith said he accepted the defendant had strong beliefs in witchcraft and thought she was possessed by the spirit of her dead grandmother at the time of the attack in May 2009.</p>
<p>He told Leeds Crown Court: &#8216;She believed spirits can enter the body and make you do things that otherwise you would not have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He praised Mbulawa as &#8216;unusually confident and assured, also not unintelligent with a degree of charm and poise&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Family members were in court and her mother Sisbsisiwe gave Mbulawa an emotional hug as she was released from the dock. She will now be able to move back in with her mother in Braunstone Frith, Leicester, after living apart for two years.</p>
<p>Mr Justice Keith told Mbulawa: &#8216;I hope that you and your mother can come to terms with what has happened. I wish you all the best for the future.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mr Justice Keith allowed Lorraine Mbulawa to walk free from court</p>
<p>The court heard a psychiatrist who assessed Mbulawa said she was still a risk because she believed the spirits could possess her again and she has no control over them.</p>
<p>Describing the attack, Mrs Mbulawa, a nurse, told the jury: &#8216;I saw this figure in my room and a shiny object was in the air. I was petrified. I thought it was an intruder.&rsquo; </p>
<p>She turned the light on, pulled off the mask and discovered the attacker was her daughter, who screamed: &#8216;Mummy, people are after us. They want to kill us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Mbulawa said her husband collapsed and died suddenly in 2000 and she moved to the UK with her daughter two years later.</p>
<p>In her evidence Mbulawa told the court: &#8216;My grandmother said my mother was responsible for the death of my father and I had to do the honourable thing to my father by killing my mother.&rsquo; </p>
<p>A policewoman who arrived at the house said Mbulawa was sitting on the stairs in a trance-like state, crying, shaking and hyper-ventilating, while her mother, who was bleeding heavily, was trying to comfort her.</p>
<p>PC Patricia Lutz said Mbulawa was co-operative and appeared to calm down on the journey to the police station and then seemed &#8216;like a different person&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After the case Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, said the case was an example of a trend in soft sentencing. He said: &#8216;It is cases like this that make people lose faith in the criminal justice system and in politicians as well.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Everyone can use that defense now.  After all, belief in witchcraft persisted in Britain well into the 19th century.  Wasn&rsquo;t there an Irish/ Scots thing that dead people&rsquo;s souls migrate into the bodies of seals and hang around bays near their old home?</p>
<p>Then too, with Wicca, Glastonbury, the Druids, the various Stonehenge ceremonies and all the interest in  folk lore,natural healing, crystal therapy etc it should be easy for anyone of any race, educational, economic level whatever to claim a belief in witchcraft.</p>
<p>One assumes that the daughter has obtained her own council home and no longer has to share with her Mother.</p>
<p>An attorney I know that people sometimes attack and even shoot and kill family members or roommates who they thought was an intruder.  But seldom do they don black masks to do it. </p>

		<p>To think of all those elite intellectuals and sociologists who sneer at the &#8220;working class&#8221; who have superstitious beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working class&#8221; is code for White.  Gypsies, hindus, asians, blacks all non White groups can believe in the most insane nonsense an the elites consider it wonderful diversity.  But a White who believes in some supersistion is a sub human redneck cracker etc.</p>
<p>Asians can cut down every tree in town because trees on streets in front of buildings are &#8220;bad luck&#8221; and the sociologists will go to war with the environmentalists to defend the tree cutting.  As the song says, anything goes.</p>
<p>A friend is a nurse&rsquo;s aid.  She used to work in a hospital in a chinese suburb that had many chinese patients.  There were a jillion ridiculous asian supersistions that had to be observed.</p>
<p>Specially for the nurse&rsquo;s aides who have to make the beds, asian patients relatives tuck all sorts of charms away in the bedclothes.  If they are lost the aides have to spend hours sorting through dirty laundry to find the things.</p>
<p>Dealing with the charms every time she had to make a bed took so much time she quit and went to another hospital.  Before she applied, she walked through the hospital checking to see if there were many asian patients.</p>

		<p>Britain has, for some time now, lost the right to call itself a democracy with the rule of law.  It&rsquo;s neither of these.</p>
<p>But that is not the real problem.  The REAL problem is white britains (the ONLY real britains) don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is harsh but there is simply no way such a situation could exist unless the majority of people wanted it this way, especially considering the very low level of jackboot style enforcement.  Yes, it does happen.  But nowhere near the levels of say, the old soviet union.</p>
<p>What I am saying is, at least the russians had to be forced&hellip;.terrorized and beaten into submission.  The british had none of these things happen on any scale worth mentioning.  An isolated incident here or there but nothing approaching any level of real threat to the average person.</p>
<p>So what excuse to white british males have?  And I use the term &#8220;male&#8221; on purpose&hellip;..because they certainly aren&rsquo;t men.  They aren&rsquo;t even slaves.  A slave is one who cannot speak their thoughts.  But the average brit, although there is some risk involved, could&hellip;..and CHOOSE NOT TO.</p>
<p>Quite frankly I am tired of hearing, oh the elites think this, the elites did that.  I haven&rsquo;t seen a true example that the elites have any power to bring any meaningful consequences to bear on anyone, in a long, long time now.  The elites are not the problem.</p>

		<p>I know what my defense will be. I used to be a Liberal, and Wiccan, then Athiest. &#8220;Oh no! The spirits of Witchcraft are forcing me to shoot illigal aliens as punishment for turning away from Wicca!&#8221; It might work&hellip;LOL</p>

		<p>Why is it that so many in the West still do not understand that most Africans (the black ones) believe in evil spirits and the like?  When I lived there even our maids would put bricks under their bed supports so that the evil spirits called &#8220;Tokoloshes&#8221; could not get onto the beds.  And these had been educated in proper schools.  I suppose with such stories as written by J K Rowling (Harry Potter books) and filmed showing witches, etc we can expect a generation of our youth to also believe in such rubbish.<br>
But Africa will change when China has fully colonised it and China will ignore the propaganda and make sure that it becomes more civilised, Chinese style.  I wonder how the Western history books will be written then?</p>

<p>He praised Mbulawa as &lsquo;unusually confident and assured, also not unintelligent with a degree of charm and poise&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
I have no doubt that this young Zimbabwean is &#8220;unusually confident and assured&#8221;: confident enough to take a knife and slash up her own mother. An aggressively violent unprovoked attack like this is not the work of a shy wallflower. I&rsquo;m equally sure the judge is correct that the stabber possesses &#8220;a degree of charm and poise.&#8221; We&rsquo;re all familiar with the notion of &#8220;the charming psychopath.&#8221; Many serial killers have been quite charming; indeed, it&rsquo;s often how they lure their prey. </p>
<p>Confidence, self-assurance, and charm are all nice qualities for a person to have   &mdash;   but they are not enough to excuse attempted murder (matricide, no less!). And in a gruesome case like this, such personal traits as whether the accused is a pleasant conversationalist or not, should be ENTIRELY IRRELEVANT to sentencing. The fact that this judge is countenancing and legitimizing them in a British courtroom, is a disgrace to Britain&rsquo;s noble legal history. </p>
<p>He is also, of course, countenancing and legitimizing ignorant African witchcraft and &#8220;stupor-stition&#8221; as well, but I expect other commenters will deal with that aspect of the case. </p>

		<p>At least she didn&rsquo;t try to blame her actions on white people.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe black Africans can be possessed by evil spirits. If you believe in anything enough then it does become real to you. </p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t care how many Africans kill other Africans or what the reasons are. Never look a gift horse in the mouth. </p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t try to kill white people or blame their actions on whites I&rsquo;m happy with whatever they do. I would be even happier if they would do it in Africa. </p>

		<p>Can the prosecutor appeal?  Is there nothing like a mandatory minimum sentencing rule for violent, premeditated, homocidal attacks here?</p>
<p>Did the cops not even -attempt- to do a background check to see if she might have alternative (boyfriend, abortion, wants a car and can&rsquo;t get one herself&hellip;) motives, mentioned casually to friends?</p>
<p>What about a polygraph?  It&rsquo;s one thing to admit you tried to kill someone.  It&rsquo;s another to &#8216;with poise&rsquo; deny that your motive for it was not X/Y/Z _illegal as hell_.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like this is yet another case of the black perpetrator being labeled a victim because she is a refugee.</p>
<p>Having said that, I would not waste a single shilling on the lot of them.  If they have problems with &#8216;spirits&rsquo; in England, they should go back to Zimbabwe to deal with them.</p>
<p>First convicted offense.  Lose you green card and go home.  </p>

Do you really expect that the Chinese takeover in Africa will drive out superstition?? Good grief.. it will expand it! I bet you have never lived in Hong Kong or anywhere in Asia-Pacific where the Chinese have lived for centuries. Superstition dominates their entire lives from birth to death and beyond. Not as though I am criticizing these customs, far from it, as most predate Christianity by a couple of thousand years and I found the majority of these ways very civilized compared to Africa, at least they don&rsquo;t chop up albinos as a cure for AIDS whilst eating tiger balls to promote a healthy sex life!! This doesn&rsquo;t happen in Africa&hellip; no tigers!! Meantime, Mbulawa&rsquo;s actions wouldn&rsquo;t go down at all well in Chinese society as they have a healthy respect for their elders, living or dead. Another black from Zimbabwe has just been delivered into continual expensive welfare care in UK by one of our enlightened judges as he will probably be tortured if he returns home. All he did was rip out peoples teeth with pliers. What&rsquo;s with these people??</p>

<p>I doubt many kids of any stripe (unless prompted to do so by their parents) will find the Harry Potter story any more of a convincing proof of magic than we found AD&D; to be proof of magic and dragons a generation or so ago.</p>
<p>The fact that some, if not many, people DO hold similar beliefs, however, is more of a general failure in applying logic, reason, evidence and scientific methodology outside of Western society.  Many inside of it even have problems with those concepts, but at least they&rsquo;re still mentioned here once in a while, and I think they do sort of still teach the sciences, don&rsquo;t they?<br>
