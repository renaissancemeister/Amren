			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), May 7 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A protest by hundreds of Osama Bin Laden supporters sparked fury outside the US Embassy in London today as they staged a mock &#8216;funeral service&rsquo; for the terror leader.</p>
<p>Police stepped in to separate the protesters and members of the English Defence League amid threats of violence from both sides.</p>
<p>Radicals carrying placards proclaiming &#8216;Islam will dominate the world&rsquo; branded US leaders &#8216;murderers&rsquo; and warned vengeance attacks were &#8216;guaranteed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>For many, it was a shock that the protest was allowed to go ahead in the first place as it came shortly after the verdict into the 7/7 inquest was released by Lady Justice Heather Hallett.</p>
<p>She recorded that the 52 victims had been &#8216;unlawfully&rsquo; killed when four terrorists attacked three London Underground trains and a bus in 2005. </p>
<p>Lady Justice Hallett made a string of recommendations to both MI5 to prevent further atrocities and to 999 workers to react more effectively to major events.</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims wept openly as the judge announced her verdict and she paid tribute to their &#8216;quiet dignity&rsquo; before reading the name of each person who died.</p>
<p>However just three miles from the Royal Court of Justice, Muslim protester Abu Muaz, 28, from east London claimed &#8216;it is only a matter of time&rsquo; before another attack and that the &#8216;West is the enemy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The capital has seen heightened security in recent days over fears of a revenge attacks by Al-Qaeda members.</p>
<p>The protest against Bin Laden&rsquo;s death was organised by controversial preacher Anjem Choudary  &mdash;  who praised both 7/7 and the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>The former UK leader of the outlawed al-Muhajiroun and member of the &#8216;poppy-burning&rsquo; Muslims Against Crusades extremist group called on the U.S. to return bin Laden&rsquo;s body to relatives.</p>
<p>He has already warned of another 7/7-style terror attack in the wake of Bin Laden&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Britain has followed the US in placing its embassies, diplomatic missions and military bases around the world on heightened alert in recent days.</p>
<p>An EDL member did manage to slip through police lines to unveil an effigy of Bin Laden in the middle of the 300-strong group of extremist Muslims.</p>
<p>It prompted screams of &#8216;USA, burn in hell&rsquo; and &#8216;Obama, burn in hell&rsquo; from angry protesters.</p>
<p>The protests from both sides left onlookers in Grosvenor Square unimpressed.</p>
<p>Mary Smythe, 38, from Croydon, south London, said: &#8216;I think both sides are pathetic, quite frankly.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s disappointing and horrible to listen to the threats. They are all an embarrassment to this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bin Laden, who masterminded the attack in 2001 on the Twin Towers in New York, was killed on Monday by U.S. forces in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The CIA spied on Osama Bin Laden for months from its own top-secret safehouse in Abbottabad, it has since been revealed.</p>
<p>In one of the most intricate intelligence operations in CIA history, spies moved in to a property next door to Bin Laden&rsquo;s fortified compound to establish his &#8216;pattern of life&rsquo;. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama yesterday visited New York to place a wreath at Ground Zero.<br>

		<p>&#8220;It prompted screams of &lsquo;USA, burn in hell&rsquo; and &lsquo;Obama, burn in hell&rsquo; from angry protesters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama is now a lock for a second term. </p>
<p>The more the Arab street condemns him, the tighter American voters   &mdash;   whites included   &mdash;   will get with him. </p>
<p>And if the Bin Laden clan manages to get Obama put up on charges in the international criminal court he might even get a third term. </p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s got to be grinning from ear-to-ear about this. He may have needed AA to get into Harvard Law School, but he is certainly not a stupid man. </p>

		<p>&#8220;UK Muslim protesters: It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before another July 7-type attack&#8221;</p>
<p>And after it occurs the white weenies will be screeching hysterically for people to be more tolerant of Islam.</p>
<p>These would be the same cowards who would allow sharia law to rule their lives and who advocate for more immigration from third world countries even though they don&rsquo;t have enough work for their own people.</p>

		<p>And no doubt any Englishman who speaks out against this insanity in their country would be roundly condemned by their nation&rsquo;s &#8220;leaders&#8221; and probably brought-up on charges of inciting some kind of &#8220;racial hatred&#8221; or other Orwellian baloney, and end up fined and/or tossed in prison!!   </p>

		<p>These Islamic radicals are just so damn weird.  Looking at the photos can you imagine any one of them with a girlfriend?  How can these cretins not be shunned by their own people?  And the threats about another 7/7 attack.  Don&rsquo;t they know that they could all be wiped out of Britain as well as Europe if the natives finally had enough?  It&rsquo;s going to come to a head at some point and these nutjobs will not like the outcome.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Unlawfully&#8221; killed! Is that like &#8220;unlawfully&#8221; mugged, &#8220;unlawfully&#8221; raped, &#8220;unlawfully&#8221; car-jacked? They were SLAUGHTERED lady!!! <br>
It&rsquo;s idiots like her that BROUGHT ABOUT the &#8220;unlawful&#8221; deaths of the 52 victims! The blood is on THEIR hands!</p>
<p>*Muslim protester Abu Muaz, 28, from east London claimed &lsquo;it is only a matter of time&rsquo; before another attack and that the &lsquo;West is the enemy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In a sane world the response to that would be - &#8220;yes and when you start bombing, you&rsquo;re homeland will become a sheet of glass!&#8221;</p>

<p>No my dear, YOU are the &#8220;pathetic embarrassment to the country&#8221; by not JOINING your fellow Whites in the English Defence League! They are trying to save YOUR neck but you&rsquo;re too blinded by P\C to see it. </p>

		<p>Eric wrote&hellip;&#8221;Looking at the photos can you imagine any one of them with a girlfriend&#8221;?</p>
<p>Using Obama Bin Laden as an example, you know he was one of 54(!) children <br>
sired by his father Mohammed bin Laden with his 22(!!) wives.<br>
Incidentally Bin Laden Snr died at the age of 59 in a plane crash, meaning he could have spawned even more.  OBL himself had six wives that we know about in the West, fathering between 20-26(!!!) children.</p>
<p>Okay money and prominence surely plays a factor with these big numbers, but its still mind boggling to think of the potential exponential population growth from one Muslim family alone.</p>
<p>I remember thinking a few weeks back when it was reported that one of Gaddafi&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s was killed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s got to hurt&rdquo;, but then it was reported that he was one of ten Gaddafi children (eight of which were biological), still depressingly &#8216;ten&rsquo; is a low no. compared to the Bin&rsquo;s.<br>
 <br>
Made me think of the whole equality conundrum again, in that if you have one to two children as us Westerner&rsquo;s seem to, and then we tragically lose one, how could you equate that pain to someone who has lost one of 10-20 children, it just doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>Sure losing any child has got to hurt, but if you have 10+ &lsquo;spares&rsquo;, your life would not be potentially over as it would if you lost your only child.</p>

<p>The Infowars/Alex Jones conspiracy types who are deeper down the rabbit hole than I prefer to be, are saying to watch out for (another?) false flag attack between now and the 2012 election, they&rsquo;re only really paranoid until it happens. <br>

		<p>Pakistanis holding British passports are out in the streets openly, explicitly and unashamedly calling for terrorist attacks on British soil.<br>
 By any measure this is treason.<br>
Of course, the British govenment (C0nservative lead), does absolutely nothing whatsoever.<br>
 Compare and contrast with the state persecution of the BNP, when BNP leaders happen to utter the most trivial and harmless of &#8216;forbidden words&rsquo;.</p>

Not that I wish suffering on ANYONE, but in a sane nation that also respected itself, and the sanctity of it&rsquo;s survival, it would be settled as cheaply as a single bullet in the back of the head, and kicking the dead body of the mortal enemy into a ditch. <br>
But then again, as long as Westerners keep inflaming Muslims by occupying their homelands (thus making freedom fighters who justly hate westerners), this is not a sane world at all, is it?<br>
The equation is simple. Islam is awful, but let Muslims practice it, as they wish. As long as we &#8220;spread Democracy&#8221; they will hate us. As long as we allow insane immigration from such misfits, they will likewise hate us.<br>
Thus we have a prescription for permanent war, which the MIC loves. <br>
WOOHOO!</p>

Good point, Eric: though I have NO doubt that such irrational behavior is closer to the norm in the third world than in the white world, I would guess that these protesters (ever notice the protests are small?) are LOSERS!<br>
I mean that. Probably sexless losers, unless they rape their women. (Also, unfortunately more accepted in the third world).<br>
As for them being swept out of the host countries they feed on, well, it will take an EPIC change of political tide.</p>

		<p>A year after the July 7 attacks a memorial service was held for the victims.  It was a major event.</p>
<p>Red Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London at the time, wanted to include the bombers in the service as &#8220;victims&#8221; of the bombings. He planned for their veiled and shrouded Mothers to be chief mourners, not the families of the English victims of the bombing.</p>
<p>That is the mind set of the English ruling class.  </p>
<p>Most of the population of England is on some sort of welfare, whether it is housing, child benefit whatever.  The Whites continue to vote labor bacause of the welfare and class hatred of the so called &#8220;elite&#8221; conservative Tories.  </p>
<p>With affirmative action so prevalent, Whites are pretty much forced into the welfare system because of the affirmative action laws which are as bad as ours.  For Whites, it is either lifelong welfare or leave the country to make a living.</p>

<p>Yeah right! that&rsquo;ll help fend off 20 million Muslims the UK has allowed in already, probably more like 40 million there now and they are starting to flex their muscle and voting power. Muslims are beginning to flex those same powers in the U.S. now too, in Detroit and later in other cities as they take total control of Detroit and have a serious beach head, they will send troops to other cities to help them take over.</p>
