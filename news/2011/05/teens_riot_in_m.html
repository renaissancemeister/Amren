	<p>{snip} Security footage from a Manhattan Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts shows a group of youths climbing on counters, throwing chairs and throwing tables in a violent attack on workers.</p>
<p>It happened at the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. A $2,000 hot chocolate machine was reportedly destroyed in the attack.</p>
<p>Similar attacks have targeted other stores in the neighborhood in the previous weeks.</p>
<p>The video shows one of the teens throwing a chair and then running up to grab a donut.</p>
<p>A few of the attackers also grabbed drinks out of a refrigerator near the door, and they all quickly ran from the store.</p>
<p>Some businesses and even residents recently have complained about violence in the area. Most of the business owners didn&rsquo;t want to give their names for fear of retribution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The NYPD said it was examining the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts security footage but has not made any arrests.</p>

		<p>This story has two problems:</p>
<p>1. The civil rights &#8220;community&#8221; isn&rsquo;t demanding that surveillance camera footage be censored so that the racists won&rsquo;t have bigoted and stereotyping images of African &#8220;Americans&#8221; that are broadcast on the Internet (invented by Whiteys) with the sole purpose to &#8220;reflect poorly upon the community of color&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. The local White Humanity isn&rsquo;t demanding that the civil rights &#8220;community&#8221; reach out to their &#8220;community of color&#8221; and encourage &#8220;their people&#8221; to &#8220;increase the intensity&#8221; at identifying who these violent criminals are and turning in the names to the police.</p>
<p>These two failures are always present in weekly stories about &#8220;youth and teens just acting out in perhaps inappropriate ways as they struggle with the enduring and painful legacy of slavery and racism and lynching and the hurt caused when Whiteys don&rsquo;t do enough to atone for the sins of segregation by holding themselves accountable to people of color for their unearned White privileges&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Black mob flashings and violent interracial attacks are getting worse with each passing year.</p>
<p>I wonder if the people who voted for Obama, thinking they would placate blacks into behaving, realize that the situation has gotten far worse even though trillions of dollars have been directed toward all things black by this corrupt administration?</p>
<p>Giving blacks privileges and money makes them even worse.  There&rsquo;s ample evidence to prove that point.</p>

		<p>This is why there should be &#8220;No Blacks Allowed&#8221; signs posted where the colored people misbehave, and restricted covenants for towns to bar them from living/terrorising good communities. </p>
<p>You really can&rsquo;t change blacks in general, therefore segregation is important to implement. Unfortunately because of the civil rights laws, we can&rsquo;t do that, and have to put up with this crap.</p>

		<p>80% of the 2000+ comments posted on the FoxNY article would not pass the decency filter at AmRen (guards!).  19.9% of the comments limit themselves to factual information, omitting the color commentary and/or suggested corrective actions.

		<p> Round up the usual &#8220;youffs.&#8221; Even though it&rsquo;s crystal clear from the video that all the perps are black, heaven forbid that the news media should state the obvious. Might get called &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p> And the usual sad conclusion to the story: By the time the police finally arrived, all the &#8220;youffs&#8221; had gone on their merry way.</p>
<p> Folks, as long as we stand helplessly by, watching things like this happen, and hoping that the police will get here soon, these thugs will continue their brazen assaults. But, trust me on this: Two or three highly publicized cases of a major hurt being put on these hoodlums while they are in the process of trashing a place of business, and the incidents will stop, as if by magic. We&rsquo;re going to have to start learning to stand up for ourselves again.</p>

<p>Christopher Street is where the gay rights movement was born (the 1969 Stonewall Riots). These students may actually be from nearby Harvey Milk High School- America&rsquo;s first all-gay high school.</p>
<p>The school is filled with gay black thugs who are regularly arrested for &#8220;wilding&#8221; in the rich white liberal West Village neighborhood. </p>

		<p>Thank you Amren!</p>
<p>This is exactly the reason I never go to Dunkin Donuts anywhere these days. you just made my trip to Manhatten NY next month a safer one. You showed me one place I must avoid in order to keep this vacation a good one. I have a list of places to avoid, and I&rsquo;ll surely mark Dunkin Donuts as a not-so hotspot! </p>
<p>We have a donut store next to the interstate that has a classic 50&rsquo;s Ford vehicle in the front, and there&rsquo;s always elderly people in there, I&rsquo;ve been in there nearly a hundred times and not one &#8220;teen&#8221;, it&rsquo;s mostly baby boomers and elderly veterans. </p>
<p>My city for some reason, all the dunkin donuts stores have had either robberies, shootings, and even one possibly confirmed sexual assualt in or just outside them&hellip;but it wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;Teens&#8221;&hellip;except they all were the &#8220;Teen Grown-ups&#8221; lets just put it as.<br>
Dunkin Donuts used to be my favorite place to get long johns and sprinkle donuts. But now, it&rsquo;s a favorite place for &#8220;Teens&#8221; to run wild in their own jungle!</p>

This happened at a DD in Greenwich Village, one of the most notorious white liberal neighborhoods in the world.</p>
<p><br>
The West Village is not just liberal,it is also extremely GAY. And Christopher Street, where this latest chimp-out happened, is Gay Ground Zero; the East Coast&rsquo;s equivalent of San Fran&rsquo;s Castro St. </p>
<p>So this attack   &mdash;   like the recent beating of the white she-male (or &#8220;transgendered individual&#8221; or whatever) at the McDonalds in Maryland   &mdash;   may also have a sexual-politics angle in addition to the obvious racial one. </p>
<p>FWIW, Christopher Street is also just around the corner from some public basketball courts, which act as a magnet for blacks from Harlem   &mdash;   despite the fact that Harlem is 120 blocks north. I had a friend who lived on nearby W4th St, a transplanted &#8220;New Southerner&#8221;, who generally took an ultraliberal line re minorities. But even he would complain about the noise and other problems (like this one) that inevitably resulted when Uptown came Downtown. &#8220;Don&rsquo;t they have any basketball courts up in Harlem?&#8221; my friend would wonder aloud. &#8220;Why do they have to come all the way down here to the Village to shoot some hoops? Why can&rsquo;t they just stay in their own neighborhoods?&#8221;</p>
<p>Why, indeed. </p>

<p>Yes, I agree this video is pretty bad. But according to the news people, we can all rest assured that these rampagers were merely &#8220;teens.&#8221; Which presumably means they&rsquo;ll all grow out of this anti-social behavior immediately upon reaching their 20th birthdays. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprized that the NAACP hasn&rsquo;t deemed surveillance cameras to be a racist instrument yet.</p>
<p>When you think about it what is more &#8216;racist&rsquo;, the action or the reaction?<br>
 <br>
Observing the original action as a reaction, should not be a crime in itself. <br>
Nor should being discerning in one&rsquo;s judgements, be a way of transferring criminal culpability to the innocent.</p>

		<p>Now imagine teaching these &#8216;youths&rsquo; in a school.  </p>
<p>Any of you who have jumped on the &#8216;blame teachers&rsquo; bandwagon because drop out rates and low scores are epidemic, please reconsider your position by scouring youtube for examples of how these types of &#8216;youths&rsquo; behave.</p>
<p>It is no different in the classrooms, and every teacher who has more than 10% of such &#8216;youths&rsquo; in a room hopes and prays everyday that darling little Shaniqua and Dequan won&rsquo;t have a blowout and start a riot.</p>
<p>You also notice that there are both male AND female &#8216;youths&rsquo; in the video.  Their girls are just as bad.</p>

		<p>This is nothing new.  This has been going on for years.</p>
<p>Whoever these black youffs  are, they are NOT from the neighborhood.  There is no black population in Greenwich Village. These youfs  come down from Harlem or over from Nwears to look for some excitement, some sex, or something to steal. Then they go back home again. Pickings are better there than in Harlem. And the population is liberal and tolerant of them.</p>
<p>I worked in the 10th Precinct (Greenwich Village)  for seven years and I can attest that there is hardly any internally-generated crime there. It all comes in from OUTSIDE the area to prey on the locals. The precinct is considered a very desireable, low-crime, choice assignment for cops and is  hard to get.There are also a lot of monied and famous people who live there.You&rsquo;d be surprised, as they are walking around in jeans, without make-up, and looking sloppy. There is also the large  NYU student/faculty crowd. And also many gullible tourists too.  These locals are not the people committing the crimes. But they make prime targets for outsider youfs.</p>

		<p>Glenn Beck just showed this video, as well as two other recent fast-food restaurant episodes featuring black teens.  Of course, he&rsquo;s also been showing maybe the only incident featuring whites, the two women fighting over pancake syrup.  I know that Beck and other &#8220;conservatives&#8221; would never mention the common denominator in practically all of these cases but we have eyes.  All the teens and their &#8220;communities&#8221; need are tax cuts and enterprise zones, right?</p>

		<p>In the early 1990&rsquo;s black yout used to take the subway down to Greenwich Village with their drums and pound away all night long just to harass the Whites. The police were told to do absolutely nothing about the boom boxes and drums pounding away all night long.</p>
<p>It stopped about a week after Guiliani took office.</p>
<p>I agree that it could not have happened in a more appropriate neighborhood.  The gay White male against other White males is proof of insanity.  The job discrimination alone should keep gay White men away from the liberal coalition.  Are the New York gays doing anything about the gay bashing?  </p>
<p>San Francisco gay White men took control of their neighborhoods decades ago.  In fact, one San Francisco neighborhood, Fillmore was reclaimed by the White male gays starting about 1975.  Fillmore was all White and Japanese until about 1950 when the blacks who had been brought to the shipyards during WW2 drove out the Whites in just a few years by force, fear, pillage, murder and rape.</p>
<p>San Francisco gay men do however, allow the gay establishment to hide the racial identity of the gay bashers and just plain robbers and thugs who attack gay men.  The official gay community always pretends it is evil White boys from the suburbs who drove miles into the city to abuse gays.</p>
<p>Gay bashing by the way, is just more lying liberal propaganda.  When ever a gay is robbed or assaulted it is classified as gay bashing hate crime.  Men are robbed and assaulted more than women.  Urban people are robbed and assaulted more that rural people.  People who are out at night are robbed and assaulted more than people who go home and stay home right after worl</p>
<p>Male, urban, out at night, that describes the majority of victims of robbery and assault.  That also fits gays.</p>
<p>Women are not victims of robbery as much as men because women, knowing they are vulnerable are not out alone, at night as much as men.</p>
<p>It was because the official gay spokesmen went along with black thugs robbing and gang beating gays that the gay men took matters into their own hands instituted neighborhood watch groups and agressively defended them selves against the blacks.</p>
<p>There is no difference between a gay neighborhood watch group and the old KKK.  Both organizations made communities safe for Whites.</p>
<p>When ever liberals mention the klan I tell them loud and clear that they were a neighborhood watch group.  They are agast.  So I just cite crime statistics until they shut up.  Crime rates in the south went up very high when the KKK was defeated by the unspeakable SPLC.</p>

		<p>Poster 30 mentioned basketball courts.</p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles.  The White Americans tend to be the Greenwich Village types, very rich and extremely liberal and very anti all Whites except themselves.  I don&rsquo;t think I have seen one Republican bumper sticker or lawn sign in 20 years.</p>
<p>Luckily those Whites got old, retired and moved.  Their place has been taken by White immigrants who detest blacks.  A store was bought by the city, torn down and a small park installed in the lot.</p>
<p>I served on a neighborhood committee that made suggestions about what was to be in the park.  It was unanamous that there not be a basketball court because it would attract &#8221; a criminal element.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White immigrants own most of the retail stores. As soon as they arrived they took care of the occasional black predators who got off the freeway and roamed the neighborhood looking for victims.</p>
<p>There was a purse snatch on the local business street.  The White immigrant store owners got together and reviewed all their securtity cameras.  They got good pictures of the black thugs and their car.  They printed up a lot of pictures and posted them all over the neighborhood.</p>
<p>They described the predators as black!!  Now when was the last time a criminal was described as black?  1965?</p>
<p>Much as I dislike being shoved out of jobs because of immigrants, I have to admit that the immigrants of all races are improving the lot of Whites vis a vis blacks.</p>

		<p>Young thugs are induced to rob Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts because shops like these feature a synthesis between cheap quality and high cost in their marketing campaigns and layout.</p>
<p>Thugs try and destroy small shops because they know that citizens and non-citizens look down on broken unkempt businesses which create mature targets for consistent robberies.</p>
<p>A few years ago a Puerto Rican bus driver attempted to intimidate an elderly hotel patron inside a shuttle bus by raising a filthy broom against the shuttles driver side window.</p>
<p>The bus driver wanted to show the rider that the bus was cheaper than it looked and only needed filth to provoke a confrontation.<br>

		<p>City life must suck, blacks in the rural south are not that brave. The employees at my local stores are predominantly White, with some of the hispanic females of class sometimes, like at mcdonalds. My local Quiznos is all White. The nearby walmart has a lot of blacks and darkie mestizos wandering around, but not employed.</p>

		<p>If there are enough of these wildings and robberies, the inevitable result will the the disappearance of this type of store  (where you can go in, wander around, and help yourself). </p>
<p>There will be, instead, everything kept  behind thick bulletproof plastic, and you will have to ask for it, through a little window   &mdash;    just like liquor stores in the ghetto today. </p>
<p>Because ofr our racial dilemma, everything just gets worse. And nobody dares to say so or to deal with it,  so we just keep backing down.</p>

		<p>Those sanity-challenged teens should be jailed. No less than fifteen years, and if that&rsquo;s not enough to chasten them then they should be behind bars for good. Anyone who has put up a business knows the amount of effort to not only put up one but to keep it afloat. And to have it trashed by subnormals just out for a kick is unforgivable.</p>

They&rsquo;re just as bad as &#8220;urban youths&#8221; used to be.   <br>
(Anything to avoid calling them what they are.)</p>
<p>Well, this comes from the same people who call criminal foreign invaders &#8220;immigrants&#8221; or &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221;.  So what else could we expect?</p>

<p>Yes, the White immigrants in Los Angeles are iranians, armenians, russians, arabs, egyptians, indians etc.  They all absolutely despise blacks and liberals as so many have come from the former soviet union or countries like Iran and Turkey, menaced by the soviet union so beloved by American liberals over the years.</p>
