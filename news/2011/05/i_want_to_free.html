<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_qYKa1n8Es">I Want to Free France From EU Straitjacket  &mdash;  Far-Right Party Leader</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While the EU forces France to accept more and more immigrants, the country has already had enough, with anti-ethnic sentiments growing every year, believes Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right party National Front. Marine follows the political line of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, who is famous in France and all over the world for his conservative and anti-immigration views. In her interview to RT, Le Pen claims the EU is expanding at France&rsquo;s expense. &#8220;We no longer control our own territory, our currency or our laws. We don&rsquo;t decide who comes in, or stays in our country. They impose directives on us without even consulting people. All this is hurting our economy and discouraging foreign investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Le Pen, the European Union wants to force 150 million immigrants on France over the next 30 years, explaining it by low birth rate. &#8220;Well let&rsquo;s encourage people to have kids, as they do elsewhere in the world, rather than wave in the immigrants,&#8221; argues Le Pen. She believes the problem is also that French people should be liberated from the inside, freed of the &#8220;guilt that their leaders have placed in them for so many years&#8221;. &#8220;Immigration is an organized replacement of our population. This threatens our very survival. We don&rsquo;t have the means to integrate those who are already here. The result is endless cultural conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having worked as a lawyer who defended immigrants, Marine Le Pen claims she does not hate immigrants themselves, she is only against ceaseless immigration. &#8220;You can be against immigration, fight immigration, suspend all immigration, but not hate immigrants as individuals. I understand immigrants want a better future here. But I honestly say to them  &mdash;  &rsquo;you can&rsquo;t find a better future here.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re finding it hard to give a better future to our own people as it is.&#8221; Le Pen insists that no community should shut itself off from the state, having its own laws or rights. Everyone must submit to the French way of life, its practices, traditions and rights, with no exceptions.</p>
<p>Le Pen calls the National Front &#8220;a party of patriots&#8221; and says it is understandable why the current French government does not like them. &#8220;Since we defend our country and give power back to our people, so a nation can be sovereign and people can make their own decisions, the political elite see us as a threat.&#8221; She believes that France should stop &#8220;bowing to America&rsquo;s decisions&#8221; and strengthen its ties with Russia instead. &#8220;I believe we should turn to Russia for economic and energy partnerships. I think very objectively this &#8216;Cold War&rsquo; imposed by America on relations with Russia is a huge political error.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As long as it serves as a pretext for Islamization, the EU is not worth being in unless member states opt to de-Islamize, ie: repatriate most of their imported 3rdWorlders &amp; their unmixed progeny. That said, France should stay in the EU and help Russia effect de-Islamization as an example for Holland &amp; Italy in particular and the rest of the EU in general.</p>

		<p>Calling her &#8220;far-right&#8221; is a way to try to make her and her party seem to be extreme and on the fringe. Her party, when looked at, is just center-right. Perhaps there are those who consider that looking out for the best interests of the majority of citizens of a country is an extreme position; most people don&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>The Le Pen&rsquo;s have always been very anti-American.  I understand it to a point, the point being that our &#8220;melting pot&#8221; policy is not one they wish to imitate (but seem to do better than us).  However, this idea that our &#8220;Cold War&#8221; with Russia is imposed on them seems to me to be pure fantasy.  If Marine Le Pen doesn&rsquo;t see the Marxism of the EU as France&rsquo;s primary problem, I fear that she and the party will fail out of crossed purposes and sheer incompetence.  </p>

<p>Not hate immigrants as individuals? What does that even mean? Of course you can! It is them as each individual that make up the MILLIONS!  It is the individual(times a million) that commits crimes, rapes our women, goes on the dole, steals our land and resources, demands freebies, blatant hate crimes against Whites which are never called as such, and on and on and on&hellip;</p>
<p>We read about them everyday right here on Amren and on other news media.  We have to live among them, our kids have to go to school with them, yet we should &#8220;love the individual&#8221; immigrant because they want a &#8220;better life&#8221; while they make our life a living hell? </p>

		<p>I love her stance on immigration.  Get back to &#8220;France for the French&#8221; - dump the pain in the rear Muslims and others who don&rsquo;t want to assimilate.  I don&rsquo;t know about strengthening ties with Russia; their ideas certainly proved a major failure when the USSR broke up, and I haven&rsquo;t seen any signs that they have improved any in the time since.  But, experience is the best teacher; this lady is young, and &#8220;OJT&#8221; is often the best way to figure out your folly.</p>

		<p> Marine Le Pen mentions the privileged elites &#8220;organized replacment&#8221; of the indigenous population of France. She, along with Geert Wilders and others remain the last best hope for old Europe. I&rsquo;m more hopeful for Europe than the United States, where no current politican is bold enough to stand up to our &#8220;replacement&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>From a political standpoint, Marine LePen is interesting. 75% of her so-called &#8220;far-right&#8221; platform is actually Leftist. She wants to strengthen the French Welfare State, return to strict regulation of industry and preserve France&rsquo;s liberal academic and artistic culture. She moves to the right on immigration and multiculturalism, but I would say that these are more sensible approaches rather than simple &#8220;right wing&#8221;. She is a bit of a nationalist and anti-E.U., but that is a good thing because France desperately needs a healthy dose of patriotism and pride now. I would classify Marine, not as &#8220;far-right&#8221;, but probably more along the lines of Nationalist Left. </p>
<p>Islam has been given the chance to integrate, modernize, democratize and Europeanize itself for 20 years now and it has failed to do so. The rise of the nationalist Left (in the form of Marine Le Pen) can be attributed to Islamic failure to adapt. </p>

What is all this blather here lately about finding a great and &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221;?    &mdash;   History shows us that followers of &#8220;Fearless Leaders&#8221;  usually are the first ones to get &#8220;disappeared&#8221;   &mdash;   along with about 60 million others!!</p>
<p>History repeats, especially for the dumb and obedient followers.</p>
<p><br>
PS.  Does Switzerland have a great and fearless LEADER?  Oh, no? Why not?  They seem to have done quite well without one. In fact, they&rsquo;ve done better than ALL the others.  </p>
<p><br>
Gee, how to they manage without a great leader? </p>
<p>Their neighboring countries, to north and south, that had &#8220;great and fearless leaders&#8221; within the past century, all crashed and burned. The  happy Swiss came through unscathed.</p>
<p>Can someone even tell us who is the president of Switzerland? Do they even have a president? A king?  A fuhrer?  A what?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell you. I can only tell you that it is a very prosperous, healthy, safe, well administered,  and law-abiding country, and the rest of the world (even their own neighbors) want to go and live there. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s mind-boggling that the EU is concerned about the welfare of third world immigrants yet won&rsquo;t even think of allowing the Boers of South Africa to return to their ancestral homelands in Europe. The Boers are facing extermination and are living in terror.The wide open spaces of America and Australia are also denied to the Boers, and the &#8220;liberals&#8221; seem happy to see them suffer horrible deaths.<br>
Yet white people are slowly waking up to the realities of this multiculturalist paradise in which we are all marked for extinction. With Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders leading the way, hopefully we are on our way to reclaim our rights.</p>

		<p>On May 3, 2011, around 2:00 p.m.,in Daly City, California, just south of San Francisco, directly in front of a parked taxicab, I saw a man kneeling on a rug, facing east.  I could not hear what he was saying as I walked by him on the adjacent sidewalk.  There were no other cars parked nearby, and what he was doing interfered with no one.  I immediately flashed on the behavior of Muslims in Paris, where, en masse, they just take over streets and sidewalks to pray.  Muslims frighten me, whether or not dressed in customary Islamic robes [pace Juan Williams].  I cannot believe that Ms. Le Pen believes that Muslims will actually assimilate.  What then is Plan B, if as she states, the very survival of France is at stake, which I think is an accurate assessment.     </p>

I can understand excluding oneself from the totalitarian<br>

a country whose entire history has been conflict with<br>

<p>This is France!  She&rsquo;s probably playing it safe,keeping within the law,  and has learned from her father&rsquo;s many past sorrows. She would doubtless be brought up on Hate Crimes or racial incitement  charges if she got too specific, and she would be  at 10:05 PM on May 4jailed heavily fined,  as her father was many times. They lost much money and even lost their headquaters building because of this. </p>
<p>This is, after all, the new France, and old-fashioned  patriots are out of favor   &mdash;   as in all of Europe.  Being patriotic and concerned for your own people is the newest hate crime.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that they would LOVE to jail her at a point like this, so close to an election,  in order to remove her from the political scene. The European Marxist left are utterly unscrupulous and will stop at NOTHING  to achieve their ends.  Principles, honor, and justice have nothing to do with it. They are only concerned with winning.  They believe that the Right deserves no rights.</p>

<p>  Regrettably, one of America&rsquo;s major exports is multiculturalism and a celebration of our &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  Russia, which still has some healthy racial nationalism, is seen as a European counterweight to America&rsquo;s cultural influence. We must also remember that France has laws prohibiting &#8220;hate speech&#8221; so that Marine Le Pen must tread very carefully in her comments. As &#8220;ghw&#8221; mentions, she would not be allowed, under current legislation, to call for the outright expulsion of French Muslims.</p>

		<p>Commenter #4- I think I understand what you are trying to say. But too much of this kind of talk derails our message, and we let the Marxists get the best of us when we utter these things. There are some positive immigrants out there. Most of them are of the legal variety, and get adjusted to the host Western nation&rsquo;s way of life. Alot of the &#8220;invading&#8221; immigrants have no such intention of this, and usually they are brazen enough to put themselves in the spolight of a police lineup before too long. Our &#8220;justice&#8221; system is one of the world in the Fiest World, here in America, because the laws are slanted in favor of the assailants &amp; their bleeding-heart lawyers. </p>

		<p>While I applaud the intentions of FN to rid France of the 3rd world hordes which pollute it&rsquo;s nation, the FN has a history steeped in association with fascism and Vichy leadership.  Le Pen&rsquo;s father was a fervent believer in sophomoric Jew and Masonic conspiracy theories, and Marine even now promotes the idea of turning away from American to Russia for trade and energy partnerships while attacking free trade policies.  They have the same &#8220;blame America&#8221; narrative which they apply with comical absurdity to nearly every issue Europe is facing.   Despite these huge flaws in the FN platform I can&rsquo;t say that I wouldn&rsquo;t vote for them if I were in France, being that they are the only party who can be trusted to actually do something about the immigration epidemic. </p>
