<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A clip from a TV show called &#8220;Without Prejudice?&#8221; which was on GSN a couple of years ago. l think this video will help people to start an important dialog. ***** UPDATE E-MAIL FROM MICHAEL (Contestant on the show): Awesome man. This is so random but i am so glad you put this up. Folks are talking. The show won awards in the UK and so they made a US version. This was the pilot episode and the most popular. it was such a success that they got a full season from it. it is an hour long show and we were all randomly chosen. The judges and the contestants. So they wanted to see if the judges could &#8220;judge&#8221; without prejudice. They would go on to award the winner 25K. I was the winner. Myself and the other finalist were the only 2 contestants that got to actually meet the judges and when i met them, the polynesian guy had a change of heart and actually voted FOR me. The edits don&rsquo;t show that he came from his seat and hugged me. It was a very interesting experience. We had no idea what the judges were saying or doing or who they even were, for that matter. so i had no idea that he was racist when i went out and met the judges. It ended well though. I talked to that guy over a meal and he said that he had a change of heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<i>[From Wikipedia: Without Prejudice? is a game show created and produced by 12 Yard that aired in the UK on Channel 4 from 4 January 2003 to 16 April 2004 and ran for 2 series.

		<p>Currently, I hold no ill-will towards Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, whoever, but the world needs to understand that there is a segment of the White population who believe that maintaining the status quo ensures the death of the White race.  The world will allow for Whites-only homelands of sufficient area (all of Europe and segments of the Americas would be nice, but we&rsquo;ll probably get Iceland and North Western Montana) or the ensuing conflict will either destroy the White race forever or destroy most of humanity for the considerable future (and possibly forever as well).  I imagine WWII but on a global scale and with the use of nuclear weapons.  Otherwise though, I have little hope that the greed of the enemies of the White race will move towards a peaceful solution, and I think of the European push into the America&rsquo;s as an example of greed-gone-wild. I guess I would just prefer separate-and-relate as compared to integrate-and-hate.</p>

		<p>It is interesting what happens when a person breaks a taboo and says what isn&rsquo;t allowed to be said.  People really freak out.  If you have had bad experiences with any ethnic group, it is easy to understand your having a bias against them.  This guy clearly has such a bias, and he was brave (or foolish) enough to state that bias.  And in doing so, he broke the Great Taboo and shocked the world. </p>

		<p>That was a great clip! Note how the Whites, who seemed to not remember or have no impression of the Black guy(you know they all look alike!), were too cowardly to express such honest opinions. This Polynesian laid it right out without blinking. I think I might borrow his final line &#8220;Get a grip on how the world really works.&#8221;</p>

<p>I loved the shocked reactions, hidden smiles and the then delayed reaction (from the non Africans) of &#8220;we must argue this guy down&#8221;.</p>
<p>A fellow minority, saying that he resents African&rsquo;s protected status and that they need to stand on their own two feet, is a hard argument to counter, which is probably why the protagonist&rsquo;s had to settle on the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re ignorant&rdquo;slur.<br>
For the record, Hawaii I believe has the most &#8216;mixed race&rsquo; individuals of all States in the union (21-24%), thus ought to be a Marxist utopia. </p>
<p>Imagine how different the reaction would have been if it was a White guy saying the same stuff, shows you how conditioned we all really are, and how each racial group has its own free speech boundaries (with Whites on the bottom) . </p>

		<p>Media savvy, I read once about this episode in Keith Olbermann&rsquo;s seminal &#8220;Fifty Ways to Pick Up Chicks  &mdash;  with a forward by Rachel Maddow&#8221; (2008).  As long as he avoids the taboo of race  &mdash;  that subject of overwhelming importance in our daily lives  &mdash;  and refrains from playing with his nose, a television personality can say and do pretty much whatever he wants.  In fact, the more histrionic the better.  Actors have a hard time with their hands as they tend to hang like clods.  That is why players in soap opera are always drinking tea and coffee or, in the old days, lighting up a smoke.  Hence, &#8220;I loathe Lucy&#8221; may the anchor on MSNBC utter with impunity as he fondles himself with the vigor of a Detroit school board member.  The idea is to create a sense of movement (even so-called serious news broadcasts will feature panning cameras, soundtracks and shifting backgrounds), to present the illusion that something is happening when, in fact, the only thing occurring is maintenance of the status quo.  And all this may reporters do without cease as long as they commit not the cardinal sin of looking as stolid, inert and witless as their viewers.    </p>

		<p>Speaking of the media stirring up racial issues, our own PBS has been running a &#8220;Blacks in Latin America&#8221; program recently.  It features blacks whining about how they have been absorbed into S. American cultures without seperatism.</p>
<p>It looks like PBS is trying to stir up trouble in Latin America by creating black seperatists.  I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the black awareness movements of the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s.  The PBS program is much like the various black awareness propaganda in America.</p>

		<p>I think the only reason the guy could get away with saying what he did is because he is brown himself. It sounded as if he was pissed off that he was not as black as the other guy and therefore cannot take advantage of his blackness quite to the extent of the person he feels disdain for. </p>

I&rsquo;m more than a bit confused on the premise of this game show. </p>
<p>The comment on the main piece seems to suggest (to me) that the writer is the black man: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;I was the winner. Myself and the other finalist were the only 2 contestants that got to actually meet the judges and when i met them, the Polynesian guy had a change of heart and actually voted FOR me.&#8221;<i></i></i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very odd situation and I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it without more context.</p>
<p>Maybe this was actually designed to test the contestants and the Polynesian guy was in on it. I don&rsquo;t know, it just seem odd and I&rsquo;m trying to understand how this is a &#8216;game show&rsquo;. It looks more like a social experiment and they were testing bias and/or conformity, and group pressure. I mean it REALLY seems odd that the minority Polynesian guy would be the one with strong bias. It&rsquo;s as if they were testing the white participants to judge their reaction or to see if the comments of the Polynesian would spur them to expose their racism. If a white guy made those comments, it would be easy to denounce him as a racist. The twist is that the comments were made by a minority. Since a minority made the comment, they might be testing if white people would feel safe in exposing their &#8216;racism&rsquo;.<br>
 <br>
Without more details, I&rsquo;m skeptical.</p>

		<p>This clip really doesn&rsquo;t pass the sniff test.  The show is called &#8220;Without Prejudice?&#8221; so of course something like this will be staged to give the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; whites and minorities a chance to grandstand.  Just like most &#8220;reality TV&#8221;, it&rsquo;s out-of-work actors trying to get attention and/or work.

		<p>Anon #9 - I agree, the whole scene stank of some kind of semi-scripted &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; to show us all yet another side of the &#8220;evils&#8221; of &#8220;racism&#8221; or some such. What is notable, however, is whether scripted or not, how nauseatingly blinded the White characters appeared to be, the worst being the women, who could hardly conceal their affected adoration of the noble Black.  </p>

<p>  Yes, it&rsquo;s interesting that Dr. Henry Louis Gates is &#8220;unmasking&#8221; racism in Latin America. Professor Gates came out strongly in favor of affirmative action in Brazil because both he and President Obama benefited from it. Blacks are universally portrayed as innocent victims in this superficial series. Moreover, He uncovers resentment against blacks in almost every South American country, and yet Gates never considers that there may be reasons for the almost universal resentment. Despite his admiration for blacks, Dr. Gates is married to a white woman and lives in a predominately white neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p> Osama den Laden was not a racist and was using the old tactic of divide and conquer in stirring up trouble between the races. Of course, Dr. Gates would never dream of doing anything like that. </p>

It just goes to show you that blacks in america are not americans, they are blacks first, they call themselves &#8220;african americans&#8221; which means they put africa first. &#8220;African&#8221; is who they are, &#8220;america&#8221; is just where they happen to live now. The people make the country so anywhere inhabited by large numbers of these africans, is africa. <br>
Liberalism is a curse.</p>

		<p>I agree with those who say something doesn&rsquo;t smell right about this moment in TV history. Shows like these are all taped ahead of time and the liberal whites who oversee these show&rsquo;s would have never allowed such an honest opinion to get on the air. It had to be contrived in an attempt to grab ratings. </p>

		<p>There is nothign wrong with wanting exclusivity for your endo group in terms of legal access to resources and sharing of compassion and kindness solely amongst your racial kindred.</p>
<p>It is called conservation of empathy aka Survival Of The Fittest.</p>
<p>In fact, given that 90% of the population growth is coming from the 70-80% of the planet which is third world primitive, racial awareness could be a clear means for us to be emancipated from the guilt and the dedication to unappreciated charity that is dooming them to a Malthusian outcome at least as bad as ours.</p>
<p>Of course, everytime a Westernized Black gets the happy happy joy joy treatment, it &#8216;inspires&rsquo; someone to forget the 30%-from-2.3% of our nation&rsquo;s prison population.  And the raging idiocracy that rules a sinking ship called Africa.</p>

		<p>Well this would be refreshing were it not contrived.</p>
<p>One thing that does seem genuine though is the under-40 PC white crowd practically climbing up the back of the black guy to admonish the polynesian for his horrendous racial transgressions.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this pathetic race-to-the-bottom of racial pandering way too many times and it still disgusts me every time.  I get it personally quite often, most recently when my sister wrung her hands over poor women in Africa who have to carry 75 pounds of water from the river to the village.  She organized an assembly in the school at which she teaches so the &#8220;spoiled rich white kids&#8221; could see how much better they have it than the people they &#8220;steal resources from&#8221; and would then shoulder their rightful share of the burden of white guilt.  I wondered aloud why these poor Africans haven&rsquo;t yet figured out wells and canals to carry water when the Romans built massive aqueducts thousands of years ago, you know so the pregnant African women don&rsquo;t have to carry jars of water on their heads for miles anymore.  </p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s because of the unequal distribution of resources and oppressive legacy of colonialism you heartless racist!  Oh of course I forgot about that.  That and they don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure, machinery, and various other implements required.  That was my grandfather&rsquo;s contribution.  </p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have an answer though when I asked him who built the infrastructure and construction implements for the Romans so they could then build their aqueducts.  None of the white-guilt types ever have an answer for this questions, this is usually where these discussions end, with me being backward, unenlightened, and all kinds of four-letter words.  And the mystery of how some people are able to create civilization and others are not remains chalked up to racism, the legacy of slavery, lack of equality in the world, generally just the evil machinations of THE MAN, logic and evidence to the contrary be damned.</p>

		<p>Interesting, but the Polynesian was correct. Blacks get more hand outs than any other race in the United States other then the hispanics. One thing should be mentioned is that Polynisians, Filipino&rsquo;s, and other asians will not work with blacks. the Filipino&rsquo;s hate blacks. There is more racism amongst blacks, hispanics, and hybrid races than among white people. In fact, white people are the least racist.</p>

		<p>The black guy was caught off guard. Remember, they (blacks) really haven&rsquo;t been challenged in so long that it&rsquo;s hard for them to react to honestly about their race.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not just the whites who avoid them, all races do. Even races that have grievances against whites know that blacks are just different than other people. </p>

		<p>Only a non white would dare say something like this. The thing that really gets me though is that before the Asian guy spoke the White gals seemed to be tying them selves into knot&rsquo;s trying to say something nice about the black guy. This is something that White people seem to have a knack for, bending over backward and forward to be plesant toward black&rsquo;s. I think their biggest regret was that a non white person made these remark&rsquo;s, they would have had a field day if they came from a White guy.</p>

<p>As if on que, all those white women immediately towing the line in defense of the black. </p>
<p>A combination of suseptibility to political correctness and biological differences(thought,reasoning), have turned untold numbers of white women into willing agents against white men.</p>
<p>Suppose this guy was acctually white and had the nads to say what the Polynesian said. Would these same white women have filed personal lawsuits on the grounds they became emotionally distraught? Would this have been made into a hate crime?</p>

		<p> Put out the lantern of Diogenes! We have found a sure enough honest man! I&rsquo;d have preferred that he be White instead of Polynesian, but I guess that&rsquo;s too much to hope for in this politically correct day and age.</p>
<p> Kudos to the young Polynesian man for saying what he thought, honestly and truthfully. Shame on the others on the panel for jumping all over him for uttering the P.C. unacceptable. It&rsquo;s obvious that none of the others on the panel   &mdash;   White and black alike   &mdash;   wanted to give serious consideration to what he said, but only to gang up on him and try to make him &#8220;recant.&#8221; He refused to. But, I am disappointed to hear that he supposedly &#8220;voted for&#8221; the black contestant, then came out of his seat and &#8220;hugged him.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Regular readers of AMREN would have had a ready answer when asked why he disliked being with black people. He would have said, &ldquo;have you ever heard of the Knoxville Horror? The Wichita Massacre? The Pearcy Massacre? Denver blacks attacking whites and videotaping it? Have you looked at the many YouTube videos of black and white attacks on buses, in schools, in sandwich shops that are becoming more common every day. There is a race war going on but, Shhhhhh!

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m too cynical to believe that Polynesian guy was &#8216;being real&rsquo;. That whole piece smelled of a set-up. More likely this whole thing was staged, or at least the Polynesian was an agent provocateur sent to &#8216;stir things up&rsquo; as we watched all the Whites on that show trip over themselves to prove &#8216;I&rsquo;m not prejudiced!&rsquo; Pathetic!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I am thinking, especially if he caved in the end, anyway.  He seemed too stubborn to be shamed into doing a damned thing.  So, I think you are correct in believing that he was an agent provocateur.  Candid Camera situations aren&rsquo;t played for laughs anymore, like back in the innocent days.  There is this heavy-handed show called &#8220;What Would YOU Do?&#8221; on ABC which consists of the show using actors to stage loud, blatantly racist situations in the presence of White people, to film their reactions.  If they don&rsquo;t do anything, the show tries to guess what they are thinking, if they looked shocked or uncomfortable or offended and then if one of the Whites intervenes and scolds the &#8220;wrongdoers,&#8221; the camera crew tracks them down and praises them.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame any White person with a lot to lose for being scared these days.  These shows illustrate that we are living in a panoptic society and that yes indeed, &#8220;Big Brother is watching YOU.&#8221; </p>

		<p>While whites have been intimidated into silence regarding blacks, they speak volumes about how they really feel about them while their feet do the talking as they move away from blacks into the suburbs.</p>
<p>The Polynesian guy did well, and I seriously doubt he had an immediate change of heart&hellip;&hellip;more likely than not he was only placating a bunch of mind-controlled bigots by changing his mind until he could get away from them&hellip;&hellip;but he should have blasted the flat-nosed, gapped-toothed black into submission with an attack describing black conduct and stupidity.</p>
<p>The white monitor should never have allowed the black to make a scurrilous attack.  It was disgusting.</p>
<p>I wonder how everyone of these whites would feel living in the midst of the average black neighborhood&hellip;I mean after they had been subjected to robberies and beatings because they were white?</p>

		<p>I am disgusted with how sissy the whites were and how rude the black guy was interrupting him and getting emotional.  They asked him to explain himself, which he did (all he said was he disliked blacks because many of them had a chip on the shoulder), but all they were doing was just saying &#8220;you&rsquo;re ignorant&#8221; or &#8220;you don&rsquo;t know many black people&#8221; (Um, how can you hate someone or something when you know nothing about them?)</p>

		<p>  Speaking of the media stirring up racial issues, our own PBS has been running a &ldquo;Blacks in Latin America&rdquo; program recently. It features blacks whining about how they have been absorbed into S. American cultures without seperatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that blacks as depicted in Dr. Gates, &#8220;Blacks in Latin America&#8221;, almost always represent the poorest, the most degraded and the most backward parts of their respected countries. Professor Gates would have us believe this is due to racism and the legacy of slavery, but the condition of blacks is the same even in countries like Brazil and Mexico where the populations are overwhelmingly of mixed racial origins. I see strong evidence here that racial mixture, the dream of many liberals, doesn&rsquo;t end the &#8220;problem&#8221; of racism.</p>

The black panelist with his speech about &#8220;brotherhood and needing to get along in this world&#8221; sounded like he had the whole thing planned out and rehearsed in advance. The claim that they were riding in the car together is just too &#8220;perfect&#8221; as was the fact that not a single panelist even respected his right to have an opinion. The icing on the cake was the fact that he hugged the guy in question and had a &#8220;change of heart&#8221; at the end. A &#8220;happy (and and phoney) ending.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This guy said it! He is a credit to his race. He is white as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. In just a few minutes he has done more for white people than all the pissed-off whites who post all day on the internet and don&rsquo;t ever speak their mind in public or knuckle-up to defend a white brother/sister being assaulted. If all Polynesians are like him let me just say Welcome to America! Come on in, there&rsquo;s plenty of room for you here! I come from a prison-yard Aryan background (Connors Correction in Okla) but I would stand next to this guy in a knife-fight any day! He is honorary Aryan, same as Japanese and other Asians. I know a lot of Polynesians and Micronesians feel the same way. They are fed up with the special privileges given to blacks and all their whining and their dependence on other races to support them and feed them. We need to build solidarity with Polynesians because many of them are good and decent, civilized people just like hard-working whites.</p>

		<p>Gotta say I disagree with some of the postings here. The Polynesian guy saying what he did is not profound bravery because he is not white. He can get away with that with a scolding, because he is automatically immune (in modern day thought) from being a racist. At worst, by current conventions, he is &#8220;ignorant&#8221;. Assuming bravery is to view it from the eyes of a white envisioning themselves saying the same thing. Despite that, it is an encouraging breath of fresh air to hear anyone say their mind and speak the truth about racial issues on TV.</p>
<p>In terms of posters scolding the whites, I think they are not being realistic. Think about what you REALLY would have done in their shoes. Its fine to post an anonymous posting of what they should have said, but in reality, we&rsquo;ve all seen that whites who dare speak out are cast out of jobs, harassed and sued, issued death threats, etc. Multiply those problems for someone who has a family to support. We have to first remove the constraints against speaking out, before people realistically can do so.</p>

I just quit a job where I got to interview actors and directors, and all my friends said it was awesome. What they didn&rsquo;t know was that my boss was a jack-ass and that he skimped on paying me. If this Polynesian man has the guts to say this on T.V it must have come from somewhere. </p>
