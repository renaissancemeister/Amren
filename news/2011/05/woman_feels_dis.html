<h1>Woman Feels &#8216;Disrespected&rsquo; After Being Kicked Off Train</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Emily Sinovic, KATU News (Portland), May 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman who got pulled of an Amtrak train by police after passengers complained she was speaking too loudly on a cell phone said she felt &#8220;disrespected&#8221; by the entire incident.</p>
<p>Lakeysha Beard of Tigard was charged with disorderly conduct after police said she got into a &#8220;verbal altercation&#8221; with train passengers on Sunday. Passengers complained she refused to put down her cell phone and conductors had to stop the train in Salem, where police got involved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An Amtrak official said a number of passengers complained Beard was being disrespectful during her prolonged phone conversations on the train. Salem police reported she had been on the phone non-stop since the train pulled out of Oakland, Calif. 16 hours earlier.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amtrak does have a policy that riders can&rsquo;t use cell phones in designated &#8220;quiet cars,&#8221; like the one in which Beard was riding.</p>

		<p>Their current favorite word is &#8216;desrespected&rsquo;.  They use it so much - incorrectly, by the way - that the meaning of the word has actually changed in main stream America. It has now become a verb.</p>
<p>However, we should be proud - after all, it IS 4 syllables. And odd; they can&rsquo;t even pronounce &#8216;ask&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s worth watching the Video, just to see which part of Lakeysha first comes into view.</p>
<p>I have to admire her Operatic build, and have no doubt she can produce some awesome decibels, when inspired to do so.  And this is a fashion tip worth noting: the white-on-white outfit certainly accentuates her curves.</p>

		<p>What is it with blacks and screaming over the telephone? Black women are the worst, I have had several years of customer service experiance and have had black women yell so loud at me that I could have probably heard them without the phone. Obviously this cretin did not understand that she was in a &#8220;quiet car&#8221; and could not be bothered to move to a car where she could have used her phone without being &#8220;disrespected&#8221; by being told to shut up or at least keep the conversation to a lower tone. I cant stand this &#8220;respect&#8221; thing that blacks keep throwing up too- respect is earned not demanded. </p>

		<p>Blacks are the first to show disrespect to others yet they&rsquo;re the ones who claim they&rsquo;re being disrespected.  Their attitude is basically &#8220;I can be as much of a jerk as I want and if you all say anything you&rsquo;re being disrespectful.&#8221; </p>

		<p>That sounds like a close shave.</p>
<p>Believe me, the aggressive, swaggering behaviour of these hyper-masculined ladies knows no bounds.</p>
<p>All too often, even on the London busses, we get the gum-snapping swagger and insouciant arrogance, not to mention the grossly inflated (yes, attitudinally grossly inflated arrogance, among other things), and overweening sense of entitlement not to mention the enormously swollen grandiose sense of self-worth that seems, on the face of it, to be wholly unwarranted on the basis of historical antecedent, not to mention contemporaneous performance.</p>
<p>Even on a train from Orpington to Victoria, the entitled pushiness makes itself apparent when disembarking at Brixton, when they start shouldering and pushing as soon as the train pulls away from Herne Hill.</p>

		<p>Hey, whitey has been sending blacks messages that they can do just about anything they damn well please for the past 45 years, so why complain now?  I guess white folks reach the tipping point at about 15 consecutive hours.  Or, they&rsquo;ve reached the tipping point period.  I hope it&rsquo;s the latter.<br>

		<p>An incident I witnessed yesterday:</p>
<p>One large black she-beast at the front of the lunch line.  Two &#8220;no-speeke-da-Inglise&#8221; workers behind counter.  The black orders a turkey burger, which is not on the menu.  The 2 workers make her a beef hamburger.  She complains that they don&rsquo;t offer her &#8220;vegetarian stuff,&#8221; and then bulls her way to the front of the line for a &#8220;refun.&#8221;  All the while, yelling into her cell phone.</p>
<p>Technology is supposed to make life easier.  But with blacks, you just can&rsquo;t win again.  </p>

		<p> Why, pray tell, did it take Amtrak officials 16 hours to decide to do something about this loudmouth? Were they intimidated by her race? &#8220;Racism,&#8221; &#8220;bias,&#8221; and all the other tiresome accusations which are always trotted out in cases like this?</p>
<p> In such situations, officials need to, as Shakespeare once said, &#8220;screw their courage to the sticking place,&#8221; and do what they have to do. If this woman wasn&rsquo;t a slob and an inconsiderate jerk to start with, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been talking on her cell phone in such stentorian tones, in a public place. She got what she deserved. Next case, please!</p>

		<p>Quite frankly, I hate loud cellphone users regardless of race. We had a simialr sitaution here in Kansaas City where a young White female who was riding on an amtrack train here was practically screaming into the phone laughing and saying things like &#8220;oh my God!&#8221; &#8221; I&rsquo;m flipping out!&#8221; etc&hellip; </p>
<p>Several passengers asked her to calm down and she gave us looks as if we were invading her privacy!!! The lack of civility in our society has all but dissappeared. </p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve always thought that there is nothing harder to find on this planet than a black woman not talking on a cell phone!<br>
If I tried, I couldn&rsquo;t be funny. I live in an Atlanta suburb and my job requires me to drive more than 30,000 miles a year in and out of the &#8220;Black Mecca!&#8221; I should have made a filmography of my travels over the last 20 years. Your typical egalitarian would not believe the things I have seen! Reality is twisted and conformed to the &#8220;African&#8221; standard in this &#8220;living Hell!&#8221; <br>
You must remain cautious wherever you go and you must always remember that you will not be given quarter if you are in a situation where you are &#8220;perceived&#8221; as the intruder. Pray that you are not involved in a traffic accident with one of the locals, never stop for gas, and do not try to get food in this area! Only the naive venture into these areas with their &#8220;Do-Good&#8221; mentality. And, we know what usually happens to &#8220;Do-Gooders!&#8221;   </p>

		<p>This is very common behavior on public transportation in the Bay Area. Blacks talk on their cellphones as loudly as possible and of course cursing, vulgar language and the n-word are the majority of the conversation. The policy of &#8220;quiet cars&#8221; and showing respect to other passengers only applies to certain people. No doubt this woman will claim racism as soon as court is in session. Maybe I have lived here too long, somehow I knew as soon as I started to read the article that it would be a very fat black woman.</p>

		<p>Obviously she is the sort of person that belongs in Oakland, so they should send her back. Oregon doesn&rsquo;t need people like that around. Not just because blacks are so loud anyway, but I would venture the other passengers were probably offended by her likely vulgarity on the phone all that time. That aside, some people just don&rsquo;t get it that most other folks are not interested in hearing other peoples&rsquo; meaningless drivel when they start yakking on their cell phones. Proper phone courtesy dictates that one should not be talking on the phone any place where one would not pass wind in public, but most people are too unsophisticated to grasp that idea.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that a bunch of passengers would get together to make a complaint about a loud Black woman   &mdash;   unless THEY were Black.  I know Portland is not a majority Black city, but I still find it difficult to believe a group of Whites would have the courage to complain about a Black.  You should live in NYC where I live.  If a White complained about a loud Black, you can bet your last dollar another White or Whites would come to their aid - that is - the aid of the loud Black.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t read any comments regarding the talkativeness of blacks in general, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that blacks are rarely at a loss for words, but their BIG handicap is with the fact that it&rsquo;s all primitive jabber.  </p>
<p>What they have to say regarding debate or discussion is limited only to what they can see, feel and taste. Logic and abstract thinking are not part of their make-up, which is why they are still in the hunter/gatherer stage of evolution.</p>

		<p>Blacks are LOUD! No matter talking at work, in a store, in a house down the street, or wherever!  Cell phones should be banned in all travel,stores, etc.  simply because the blacks have no class, no self control, and no consideration of others, period!  They will NEVER change.</p>
<p> I am beginning to HATE cell phones and much of the new technology we have today. People no longer write letters, visit and have coffee, talk over the dinner table, play board games, cards, etc. They are either on their computers, cell phones, texting and no time for anyone else in their own family.</p>
<p>We did just fine back in the 50&rsquo;s,60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s without all this tech distractions and addictions. I only get on my computer for one hour in the morning and one hour in the late afternoon. No cell phone for me, either.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Disrespected&#8221; is a battle cry fighting word for the blacks.</p>
<p>Just by saying it, blacks assume the authority to commit violence against their disrespector.  Better that the defendant is a Whitey, because then just by shouting &#8220;Ise done been disrespected,&#8221; the Civil Rights Militia will come running and do all they can to beat some more White Privilege out of the offending Whitey.</p>
<p>We are soon approaching the total collapse of our White Privielge. What will they do to us when we have none left to beat out of us.  Well, there&rsquo;s always White Slavery.   Certainly they could make a moral case that restorative justice allows them to enslave us as we enslaved them.  We support the idea. We&rsquo;d like to see our Whitey liberal elites become work and sex slaves to their afrovoodoo pets.  Poetic Justice Is God&rsquo;s Justice through His Iron Laws of Nature.</p>

And yet has the ignorance and chutpah to claim she was disrespected. Typical childish mentality. I&rsquo;m glad Amtrak took action.

<p><i>Salem police reported she had been on the phone non-stop since the train pulled out of Oakland, Calif. 16 hours earlier.</i></p>

<p>Amtrak does have a policy that riders can&rsquo;t use cell phones in designated &ldquo;quiet cars,&rdquo; like the one in which Beard was riding.</p>

If Lakeysha had been doing the Cell Yell for SIXTEEN HOURS   &mdash;   in a &#8220;quiet car&#8221;, yet   &mdash;   then it seems to me the train&rsquo;s other passengers must have been extremely tolerant for a very long time, before finally getting into that &ldquo;verbal altercation&rdquo; with her. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to go ahead and assume that the term &ldquo;verbal altercation&rdquo; was some white person&rsquo;s description of the event, and not Lakeysha&rsquo;s. </p>

		<p>The part that&rsquo;s hardest for a rational person to understand is not that she engaged in the original loud, inconsiderate phoning - after all, THAT behavior was annoying and offensive only to other people, about whom she obviously cares nothing.  </p>
<p>What mystifies me is why she felt compelled to persist in her behavior after it began adversely affecting HER - until the train actually had to stop to allow police to board and escort her off.  What made it impossible for her to just put down the blasted phone, or simply move to another car that wasn&rsquo;t a designated &#8220;quiet&#8221; car?  Why did she prefer to be arrested and publicly humiliated?  It&rsquo;s a level of self-destructive stupidity that&rsquo;s just incomprehensible.    </p>

		<p>Not only does typical black behavior like this acquit and vindicate Jim Crow segregation, it also is how God calls us into deeper contemplation of the consequences of organ donation.</p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t donate my organs, because I&rsquo;m afraid that I might save the life of some black who will just go on to make life miserable for my White community.  I would donate if I knew that I would only help a Race Realist White who practices random acts of segregation on a regular basis, but if I tried to put that in my Will, the black Affirmative Action or White liberal elite probate judge would nullify that portion because I would be deemed a &#8220;racist&#8221; by the court, thus my organ donation restrictions have no merit.  They would then actually seek out a black for my organs.  </p>
<p>Remember the Vanderbilt Confederate Memorial Dormitory case?  The black judge invalidated the contract because it was signed when segregation was legal and thus interfered with Vanderbilt&rsquo;s mission of tolerance, inclusion, and diversity.    Judges will do the same to your Will if you are race conscious in your wishes and express intent.  You can&rsquo;t trust our justice system to give you equal treatment- you&rsquo;re White, therefore, you deserve nothing but more reconstruction.</p>
<p>Face if folks, our White American experiment is over.  Where to you see any hope of pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness in an America that become increasingly and intentionally less White? One day soon, Russia, even with all its hideous and incompetent dysfunction and corruption, will be our hero nation of White Humanity.</p>
<p>What good do you possibly see in the future, unless vengeance against the White unmentionables who did this to us?<br>

		<p>We know somebody who carries ear plugs with them. When they are sitting near blacks who are talking loudly, which means talking, he performs an elaborate ritual of taking out the earplugs, acting like he doesn&rsquo;t really want to use them, then give up in exasperation and inserts them into his ears while staring directly at the offending African &#8220;Americans&#8221;.  It hasn&rsquo;t gotten him killed yet, but it will. No self-respecting, dignified, offended Whitey is allowed to &#8220;disrespect&#8221; a black without eventually paying the ultimate penalty.</p>

		<p>I live in a city with a very small black population. The few blacks I pass on the street or in a car are ALWAYS on a cellphone. Its absolutely uncanny that 95% of the blacks out in public have a cellphone to their heads. I suspect that many are speaking to nobody, only appearing they are to look important. <br>
  *true story*<br>
 My sister knew a black guy 25 yrs ago who drove around a local park in his POS ford pinto that smoked more than Jackie Gleason, holding a phone receiver to his ear pretending he was having a business conversation. The receiver was a plastic Barbie phone painted black (original color pink) with an electrical cord fixed to the bottom. He would drive around very slowly with the windows down saying things like &#8220;buy 2500 shares immediately&#8221; and &#8220;have the contracts on my desk within the hour&#8221; all in his stupid ghetto black accent. Absolutely hilarious. </p>

		<p>I was at a graduation ceremony at a major university last Sunday.  At the beginning of the ceremony the incredibly awesome university band played the national anthem.  During the anthem I heard talking from our section.  How udderly inappropriate I thought.  I took my eyes off of the flag to see who this rude person was.  It was a black man in a classy suit and sun glasses talking on his cell phone.  I scanned the area.  I saw a few more blacks on phones and many more joking and laughing and talking.  I saw one with I-pod speakers in his ears head bobbing with the blankest stare I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  Everyone else was respecting the flag, most with hands on hearts, many were singing.  I say a few morons disrespected the audience of 15,000, 1000 graduates, the flag, and our country.  If anybody called them out on it, they would say they were &#8220;dissssed&#8221; and would have made a colossal scene.  How much longer is this behavior going to be tolerated?  How much longer can the attitudes of 20 idiots be more important than the values and morals of 20,000?</p>

<p>This is an area where we are having some solid, limited success:</p>
<p>Using shame, higher culture to make the worst of the NWs back down, go away.</p>
<p>NWs don&rsquo;t like to live in, be in situations where people are looking down on them, trying to change them, improve them.  We saw this in Chicago where residents of the notorious Cabrini Green housing project were offered very low rent homes in new townhouses going up in the gentrifying Gold Coast neighborhood. But the NW residents didn&rsquo;t want to live there because they felt their rich neighbors would look down on them (which they would).</p>
<p>So instead of chasing out the worst NW thugs, trouble makers with bombs and bats (worked well in the past) we need to put them down, move them away by acting like high class librarians. </p>

<p>Only thing worse than hearing one black screeching and squalling on a cell phone is 2 or more howling and yowling together.</p>
<p>Ever notice how they can repeat the same sentence over and over for 15 or more minutes?  Ever notice when talking to another they don&rsquo;t really respond to what the other says, just go on yipping and yapping and repeating themselves?</p>

		<p>Long before cell phones blacks babbled and yammered on public transportation.  I use my excellent suburban bus system, especially to go work in the city.  My employee ID is a free bus pass.  My employer charges $2,800 per year to park so the choice of the bus is obvious.</p>
<p>Blacks have a habit of getting on a bus and standing over the driver the entire trip and yapping away.  It is not that they already know the driver.  It&rsquo;s not that they have become friendly with the driver because they take that bus often.  The driver is just a captive ear.</p>
<p>There is always a black planted next to the driver, blocking the passage just screeching away.  They repeat themselves endlessly.  They ask questions and answer the questions themselves.  They have about 5 topics.</p>
<p>1.  Latest personal family dramas and squabbles<br>
2.  Latest work dramas and squabbles<br>
3.  Latest criminal court and parole dramas and squabbles<br>
4.  Some nonsensical black history fantasy and idiocy</p>

		<p>A black man named Larry converted to Islam in prison.  He was recently released, came home to Chicago and ordered his family to convert to Islam.  They refused.</p>
<p>Mr. Larry got a gun, invaded the home at night and killed his wife and 4 other family members.  A tenant in an in-law apt in the building escaped death because Mr. Larry&rsquo;s gun had run out of bullets by the time Mr. Larry kicked down the tenant&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Mr.Larry told police investigators and his defense attorney that the family had &#8220;disrespected&#8221; him by refusing to become muslims.</p>

		<p>Number 73:  Many years ago I took a Greyhound, and one black guy was behind the bus driver yakking and yakking, hour after hour&hellip;also, when they get started on Jesus, look out. The driver<br>
was really annoyed, and finally told him to be quiet. No deal. At the next stop, the cops took the noisemaker off the bus. <br>
The driver was black.</p>
<p>Yes, I notice I can hear blacks a block away. I find their voices<br>
annoying, and I hate seeing a lot of plays with blacks in parts now, and I have to hear that low bass rumble.</p>
<p>This woman was an example why I&rsquo;m happy to use my car and not public transit.</p>

		<p>There must have been a lot more to this story than is reported. Two squad cars!  Four cops and a police dog as well?  That meant they were prepared for trouble.</p>
<p>The conductor would have asked her to put away the phone or else please move to another area.  Something must have happened.  Did she assault the conductor, or some of the passengers?  Was there a fight?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t call the police and stop a train for someone just talking on the phone.<br>

		<p>Blacks kill people who &#8220;disrespect&#8221; them. I guess the truth hurts.</p>
