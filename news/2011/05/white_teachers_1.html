			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Philly (Philadelphia), May 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four white Philadelphia teachers filed federal race-bias lawsuits that accuse a black principal of creating a hostile work environment and suggesting they were unfit to teach black children.</p>
<p>The teachers work at a predominantly black elementary school that has a recent history of racial tension. Their lawsuits say that a former principal had them read an article that said &#8220;white teachers do not have the ability to teach African-American students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teachers also allege that the principal, Charles Ray III, and others undermined their work by reprimanding them, randomly changing their room assignments and letting black teachers ignore rules that their white counterparts had to follow. Ray also retaliated when they filed union grievances, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial tensions among staff at Thomas Mifflin Elementary School have simmered before.</p>
<p>A white principal left about four years ago amid a chorus of complaints from black parents. One mother testified at a City Council meeting in December 2007 that she had heard the administrator say Muslim students looked like &#8220;flying nuns,&#8221; according to news reports.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mifflin currently has about 270 students, 86 percent of them black and 85 percent of them poor, according to school district data.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;black principal of creating a hostile work environment and suggesting they were unfit to teach black children.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Really, I thought blacks wanted to be integrated so darn bad and that is what Brown vs. Board of Education was all about? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confused? </p>
<p>Looks to me blacks only want to be &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s convenient for them.</p>
<p>However, I think the principal is on to something here. I think blacks should ONLY teach blacks. And when they complain that NO black teachers are being hired to teach White children and are NOT qualified (and there not) and then this situation would be pointed out. And this will free OUR White Children of blacks. </p>
<p>YOU CAN&rsquo;T have it both ways. </p>
<p>Enough already. </p>
<p>Aside from that, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. I hope the White teachers SUE the hell out of them, win millions and never have to be around racist blacks again! The Principal needs to be named, shamed and FIRED. <br>

		<p>I would tend to agree from experience that white teachers cannot teach black students.  Once that one simple fact is agreed upon by all parties, the solution is obvious and easy to remedy.  </p>

<p>Right he is. Yaweh himself couldn&rsquo;t teach Black &#8220;students&#8221;(what a joke!!!!). So lets go back a few years to segregation. It was the right formula you incompetent, idiotic, hypocritical self loathing White social engineers who send your kids to private sans noir schools  ( unless there are African students whose parents are diplomats, doctors etc.). <br>
I hope that your own children see you for the phonies that you are but I pray that they don&rsquo;t have to learn the hard way as did Eve Carson.</p>

The notion that white teachers can&rsquo;t teach black students (which is why black kids do so poorly in school), is openly discussed and promoted in Buffalo.</p>
<p>Blacks have been pushing to strengthen the residency rule so that white, suburban teachers won&rsquo;t be allowed to teach in Buffalo public schools. No white teachers because only black teachers can teach black kids. This is now the predominate working thesis in improving black achievement (even though black failure rates have increased under our current black school superintendent). </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how the segregationists were right after all.<br>

		<p>The black principal may be onto something there.  I disapprove of his rude, unprofessional methods, however.  I can imagine white teachers being perceived by black students (and their parents) as being either racist by discriminating against black students or being racist by being condescending to them.  Either way, blacks will accuse whites of being racist.</p>
<p>My question is why would white teachers want to teach in a predominately black school in the first place.  I know many new teachers fresh out of university start in the inner-city schools but a lot of them move to the (white) suburbs first chance they get.</p>

		<p>Why would they WANT to &#8220;teach&#8221; black students in the first place?  The White teachers I have known couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out of the school where they had black students. We need and want SEGREGATION in all areas of our lives. Now that is what I call FREEDOM.</p>

		<p>Decent looking, clean, school at least, from the LINK photo.</p>
<p>I always worry about hidden agendas inherent to demographic invasions of &#8216;surrounding communities&rsquo; (which are largely white and somewhat wealthy according to the article).</p>
<p>Where are these black students coming from?  What would happen if you -did- turn a white taught school into a black taught one?  Would there only be bussing or would there be followon black-friendly adjustments in tax codes and residencies?</p>
<p>If the school goes south under black-only instruction (assuming they can find enough teachers to fill all positions), will there be demands that private schools admit certain &#8216;race equalizing percentages&rsquo; of the collapsed public school system?</p>
<p>What is the status of the public school system?  Is it already near collapse, well funded by whites who would move away with their kids if they were taught by black teachers?</p>
<p>I still say that if we don&rsquo;t reach some opportune moment of separation into a unique white homeland, we are ultimately going to look like South Africa in terms of festung laagers with barbed wire and security patrols around protected communities.</p>
<p>At that point, my last question is going to be: &#8220;Why?  Why do you want to be -there- when the moment happens and we are no longer a nation of whites with minorities but a dystopic polyethnic confederation of independent racial interests?&#8221;</p>
<p>Get these three teachers jobs in a poor white neighborhood.  Give them 2-3 adjoining houses and let them run grade-leveled homeschooling from each so that the kids who want to have a chance, can.  Only by making these kinds of conciliatory preparations can we hope to stand up a followon island society within the sea of chaos that is coming.</p>

<p>The only jobs available to college grads are either ghetto school teaching or enlistment in the military.  Flipping hamburgers and the other survival jobs are reserved for illegal hispanics.  Engineering and IT jobs are reserved for Indian and Asian foreigners.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes to get a few years experience and move on to the suburbs.  But there are very few jobs in the suburbs because no one leaves.  Many Whites are stuck in these horrble situations with savage black children in the classroom and vicious black teachers and administrators in the office and teachers lounge.  Being an escort girl is better emotionally than going through the horrors of a black environment.</p>

		<p>   I&rsquo;m an older white woman, teaching in a mostly black high school. No matter what I say or do,I am a racist. My nasty black students say, &#8220;You gettin smart wif me?&#8221; if I ask them to pick up a pencil and get to work. Disrespect, rudeness, cultivated ignorance and vile, foul spew are all aimed at me every day. The badgering and sniping go on and on for an hour and fifteen minutes at a time. Administration is feckless. <br>
   The principal has a point: nice old white ladies (who remember such things as manners)should not have to put up with sub-par behavior from little thuglings and eighteen-year-old ninth-graders. Please let me go teach white kids. Oh, heck. At this point, let me teach anyone who isn&rsquo;t black.  </p>

<p>The problem is not an inability to teach, but an inability to learn.  </p>
<p>Blacks are several years behind ALL other races including mestizos in every subject, and the reason for it is because, on average, blacks are the least intelligent racial group in the world, with the possible exception of Australian Aborigines, but even that is in dispute.</p>
<p>Their group I.Q. average in the US at 85 is an inflated figure in all likelihood, because they don&rsquo;t really have much mental ability at all in anything, but mindless chatter.  They have no business trying to compete in a first world nation.  Enough excuses can&rsquo;t be manufactured to justify their failures.</p>

		<p>I was a teacher in Detroit.  In my first interview the black Principal asked if I had any experience working with black children&hellip;.as if to suggest that they are different from white kids.  Of course they are different but I was not allowed to bring that fact up, only he was.  </p>
<p>I worked there until I found  a better job in the burbs.  Years later a former colleague told me that the same black Principal was caught have sex with a teacher in his office.   I was not surprised and of course he is still on the job.   <br>

		<p>I taught for almost 50 years and the only Afro American student whom I couldn&rsquo;t teach were the ones who didn&rsquo;t want to be taught. Of course they comprised the majority of the unteachables with a few notable exceptions. Those exceptions were generally kids who had names like Tiffany, Angela, Karin and boys named James and Lawrence as opposed to Shaneekwa, Laronda, Rontay,Keshawn &amp; A-A (dah dash don&rsquo;t be silent).</p>

<p>Dear White Guy in Japan,<br>
Obviously you&rsquo;ve been in Japan long enough to have forgotten what rude and unprofessional is. That is just typical behavior for Blacks who have been put into positions for which they are totally unqualified and in which they now have a degree of power over White subordinates. Now it&rsquo;s their time for paybacks for slavery and Jim Crow; none of which they&rsquo;ve ever personally experienced.<br>
Over my long career as a teacher I&rsquo;ve had several Hungarian exchange students in the high school in which I taught. I never had the temptation to treat them badly in order to punish them for the invasion and slaughter perpetrated by Attila against my Italian ancestors in the 5th century A.D.<br>

		<p>I would think that any teacher except the most naive, liberally deluded person would prefer not to work in a mostly black school.  These teachers who are victims of bigotry were probably assigned to ghetto schools because someone would cry foul if only black teachers were (the latter most likely!).<br>
School systems should move to quickly accomodate blacks who want all-black student/teacher schools.  Let them teach Afrocentric nonsense or whatever they want.  Sensible black parents will send their children elsewhere.  </p>

		<p>     I agree that white teachers in most cases cannot teach black <br>
students who have been empowered by U S law to be disruptive,disrespectful and at least 50 % have below average I Q .This type of behavior is reinforced in the home and rewarded with praise in the community by there peers.The irony is black teachers cant teach them either.In the end the kids lose,grow up ignorant,end up in jail, or dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;white teachers do not have the ability to teach African-American students.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Might be closer to the truth to say white teachers have TOO MUCH ability. The white teachers come into the classroom with higher standards and expectations, than the black students are able to maintain. Consequently, there is a serious quality gap between the performance expectations of the able teachers and performance realities of their less-able students&hellip; </p>
<p>Which at report-card time manifests itself in low grades for minority students&hellip; </p>
<p>Which then gets the white teachers in trouble with their school&rsquo;s black principal, black politicians, the media, etc. </p>
<p>Makes me very, VERY glad I never took up teaching. My heartfelt sympathies to those on here, like Comments #9 and #12, who did. </p>

		<p>To rjp:</p>
<p>You got Harris?!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. He was a clown.</p>
<p>Regardless of their failure records, black superintendents are in high demand and get the highest salaries because it&rsquo;s believed that black superintendents will serve as a role model to young black males.</p>
<p>Our current black superintendent is defended by blacks regardless of the increasing black failure rates during his few years in Buffalo. Of course, it&rsquo;s all about the money, according to him. NY state and the federal government aren&rsquo;t giving him the resources he needs to do his job.</p>
<p>PS: The Buffalo News reported that he has an entourage of 26 or 28 assistants who apparently do nothing other than accompany him to visit schools. More black role models for young black males.<br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s It Like Teaching Black Students: A Case for Immediate Racial Separation</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vaticanassassins.org/2010/07/whats-it-like-teaching-black-students-a-case-for-immediate-racial-separation/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vaticanassassins.org/2010/07/whats-it-like-teaching-black-students-a-case-for-immediate-racial-separation/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most immediately striking things about my students was that they were loud. They had little conception of ordinary decorum.  It was not unusual for five students to be screaming at me at once. It did no good to try to quiet them and white women were particularly inept at trying. I sat in on one woman&rsquo;s class as she begged the children to pipe down. They just yelled louder so their voices would carry over hers. They seemed to have no conception of waiting for an appropriate time to say something. They would get ideas in their heads and simply had to shout them out. I might be leading a discussion on government and suddenly be interrupted: &ldquo;We gotta get more Democrats! Clinton, she good!&rdquo; The student may seem content with that outburst but two minutes later, he would suddenly start yelling again: &ldquo;Clinton good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>  Generally, you&rsquo;re right in what you&rsquo;ve said. However, there are some teaching jobs available in remote rural areas in States like the Dakotas, New Hampshire, Montana, Alaska, etc. I would spend a few years teaching in these out-of-the-way white communities rather than an awful urban ghetto to get the necessary teaching experience. </p>

		<p>Fine-let blacks teach other blacks-in the mean time let&rsquo;s just stop paying taxes for their &#8220;learning&#8221; since, as at least one other poster pointed out, blacks generally have lower IQ&rsquo;s anyway.  Of course this article is another example of how stupid blacks can be in their anti-white outlooks:  the day is coming when many whites out of sheer disgust with their nonstop demands and trying to blame other groups for their deficiencies and failings will simply derail their gravy train.  It&rsquo;s also about time.</p>
