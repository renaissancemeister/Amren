<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Emigrants&rsquo; remittances to Mexico increased 5.48 percent between January and March over the same period in 2010, Mexico&rsquo;s central bank said Monday.</p>
<p>In the first three months of the year, remittances from outside the country rose to nearly $5.1 billion, a jump from the $4.83 billion in the first three months of 2010.</p>
<p>In the first quarter there were 15.7 million transfers, 1.9 percent more than in the same period the year before.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s central bank said that remittances in March totaled $2.05 billion, significantly ahead of the $1.65 billion in February.</p>

		<p>The United States is Mexico&rsquo;s welfare system. With figures like that, you can see why Mexico is in no hurry to keep their illiterate peasants on their side of the wall.</p>

		<p>In an earlier era, transfers from COUNTRY A to COUNTRY B were in gold and silver. Gold was exported in vast quantities from Mexico and, later, silver from China.</p>
<p>Transfers in US dollars are different [now, these days, they are on paper or on computer screens and not in raw folding cash in a suitcase] in the sense that a dollar can be traded between Mexico and Cambodia and then to China and then to Greece but ultimately the value of a dollar is determined by the Fed.</p>
<p>Every dollar exported benefits the USA sooner or later.</p>
<p>It is, politically, disgraceful that immigrant or sojourner Mexicans are doing jobs which low-skilled Americans ought to be doing, but the dollar value of currency leaving the country actually benefits 95+% of Americans.</p>
<p>The other 5% are voiceless; they neither read much nor vote significantly.</p>

		<p>Which is why we need to make a pair of choices:</p>
<p>1.  Will we wait for the failed Mexican narco kleptocracy to collapse into total anarchy before denying any further transfer payments through our welfare system -to- the &#8216;emigrant&rsquo; Mexicans.</p>
<p>2.  Will we stop allowing the use of transfer remittances -after- those billions begin to empower druglord politics (assuming they are not already as part of a protection racket&hellip;)?</p>
<p>Either way works but the point is that if Mexicans have the means to send &#8216;southern relatives&rsquo; some 15,700,000 remittances in a 3 month period worth 5,100,000,000 dollars (always more stark with all the zeroes in place, yes?), they have more money than they need to stay off welfare up here.</p>
<p>And what they are sending is doing _no good_ down there.</p>

		<p>Remember, that mexican pushing her triple wide stroller down the street, with one in the oven is the same one receiving welfare, section 8, WIC, food stamps, and a host of other benefits on behalf of her anchor babies. </p>
<p>With all that assistance, (as well as her &ldquo;husbands&rdquo; under the table job)it&rsquo;s no wonder they have enough left over to send billions back to their beloved mexico every year. </p>
<p>America is mexico&rsquo;s welfare system!<br/>
