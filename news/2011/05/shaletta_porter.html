			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philip Caulfield, Daily News (New York), May 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shaletta Porterfield, who was set to appear as Miss Wisconsin USA, resigned from the beauty contest on Friday after being charged with three counts of stealing someone&rsquo;s identity for financial gain.</p>
<p>The Madison beauty told investigators she had forged signatures of business owners on advertising contracts while working for a marketing company last year, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.</p>
<p>But business owners got wind of the scheme when the marketing company asked them to proof some ads they hadn&rsquo;t agreed to buy.</p>
<p>Robert Nagel, Porterfield&rsquo;s lawyer, said the beauty queen hatched the bogus plot because she was under a lot of pressure from the company to hit her commission goals.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nagel said Porterfield will probably resolve the charges with an agreement that would allow her to pay fines or fulfill other requirements in order to avoid prosecution.</p>
<p>First runner-up Jordan Morkin, of Green Bay, will represent Wisconsin at the Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas in June.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2010 winner, Rima Fakih, embarrassed pageant officials after a local radio station in her hometown in Michigan reveled her pole-dancing past.</p>
<p>Fakih, the first-ever Arab-American Miss USA, had won the radio station&rsquo;s &#8220;Stripper 101&#8221; contest by sexing it up on a stripper pole at a Detroit gentleman&rsquo;s club in 2007.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t personally find Jordan to be anything special. But I&rsquo;d gnaw off my own arm to get away from Shaletta. This is just more proof that the judges were politically motivated hacks.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;former&#8221; Miss Wisconsin won the prize for the same reason that Obama won the Presidency and the Nobel Prize. Affirmative Action affects everything.</p>
<p>And about all that Affirmative Action, may I add that the emperor wears no clothes. Anyone with eyes can see who the hottie is. The true beauty queen is now rightly wearing the crown.</p>

		<p>Even the crown on the former Miss Wisconsin&rsquo;s head is of an African style.  Did they decide that the crown ought to be African in style, or did they already know a black would win?  Wisconsin; Explored by the French, settled by Scandinavians, Germans, and then Slavs, now bow to your black beauty queen.  The state is so liberal, with such a love for wallowing in liberal race politics that I am surprised they did not jump with white runner-up with the next non-white down the line.</p>

		<p>No surprise why the one on the left won.  No, hardly because she&rsquo;s more beautiful.<br>
Must be another reason.  Perhaps it was her answer to the question &#8220;what&rsquo;s your greatest achievement to date&#8221;.  Answer: &#8220;Well Bob, I have many achievements but perhaps the one I&rsquo;m most proud of is being awarded the Top Seller of ads at my employer!&#8221;</p>

		<p>What a BEAUTIFUL White woman!  What a stark contrast to the one next to her&hellip;no other race of women can ever compare to a BEAUTIFUL White woman. I don&rsquo;t care what the media, etc. that likes to tell us differently. We KNOW who they are. There is something, sort of an aura, about a beautiful White person. We have to keep that INTACT. </p>
<p> How did that black one ever win any &#8220;beauty&#8221; contest to begin with? I think we all know why by now. Shouldn&rsquo;t she have been in the Miss Black America contest?  Time to have a Miss White America contest.</p>
<p>I just pray the White one has some beautiful WHITE babies WITH a White husband and that she is racially aware. For we all know the black man will target her as their next fallen victim.</p>

		<p>Although Shaletta is not my type, I can say this:  She is clearly much more beautiful than the majority of her peers I have ever seen.  But she doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle to Jordan.</p>
<p>Almost all these minority beauty queens are just more affirmative action.  Did you ever notice that the black women in the beauty competitions are from liberal predominantly white states?  Case in point, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see a black Miss Mississippi you see black Miss Vermont, normally.</p>

		<p>Interesting that the Black Miss (name of state) always seem to come from the liberal white-dominant statres.  </p>
<p>Perhaps that is the reason why the states with the highest percentages of Black population, South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana all rejected Barack Obama by overwhelming margins - as White citizens know the scam pulled by the Democrat-enslaved national Obama media enablers due to decades of watching the Second Reconstruction i their states. Corrupt and incometent Black Mayors and superintendents and legislators and the like - Too much too closely witnessed not to believe their eyes.  </p>
<p>The useful White idiot voters still think they elected the Black President that was organ Freeman from an Asteroid movie.  Whites in heavily Black states like La., Miss. and S.C. know that we elected a Black President that about as competent as Ray Nagin, Harvey Gantt, or General David Dinkins &hellip;. These useful idiots will learn wayyyyyy tooooooo late, when our country is all but destroyed.</p>

		<p>Did you ever notice the first thing a black male does if he finds a little success is Find A White Female.<br>
Now in many ways I don&rsquo;t blame him because I am well aware of their nature and IQ levels, but even more noteworthy is when you look at the bulk of their females its not that hard to understand why even their own men don&rsquo;t want them.<br>
The white female is a different story, she should be outcast by any decent person who has any pride in their race.<br>
Oh heck, I am white is it legal to have pride in our race or to say it?</p>

		<p>Many blacks believe that lying, cheating and outright theft is OK for them because of slavery and Jim Crow laws. They are &#8220;owed&#8221; money, from whites, and it matters little how they get it. Look for black criminals like Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton to rally in support of her, and attempt to portray her as the victim.</p>

  Yes, we have lived with blacks for hundreds of years in the South and know them intimately. We know both their good and bad points. Political corruption is generally not one of their good points.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;racist&#8221; is used to silence White advocacy and put us in a weak, groveling position.</p>
<p>Excoriate and humiliate any nonwhite who challenges your right to show racial pride.  I ask them why it&rsquo;s OK for them to advocate for their people, but I can&rsquo;t for mine, especially as I am now a small minority in S. California.</p>
<p>Whites who do this to other Whites are beneath contempt and deserve nothing but scorn.</p>
<p>I have reached the boiling point from this onslaught of anti-White hatred, to the point where my retort is:  &#8220;You say that because I&rsquo;m White!&#8221;    &mdash;   and I work at PC ground zero!!  Amazing what that statement does to non-Whites who think it&rsquo;s cute to excoriate Whites with me standing within ear shot.  I now say: &#8220;If I said that about YOU, I&rsquo;d lose my job and you know it.&#8221;  Or, simply:   &#8220;You hate Whites!&#8221;   &mdash;  none of them ever expects a White to fight back and it leaves them speechless.  </p>
<p>Non-Whites and White self-haters are 100% used to bashing Whites without repercussion and have gotten away with this atrocity for decades.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to put a stop to this!  Turn the tables, when anti-Whites mock Whites   &mdash;   which is really a form of contempt and White Hatred say:  &#8220;You are a racist against Whites!&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect any Whites to come to your defense.</p>
<p>And, as always, be ever careful around blacks   &mdash;   their answer to a challenge is often a sucker punch!!</p>

		<p>Beauty pagents are all about politics. Political correctness is rampant. Anyone remember sandra bullock in miss congeniality? that movie sucked.<br>
Sardonicus and I know, living in the South can make it hard to stay asleep. Nagin and his ilk make black incompetence all too visible, and the PC croud is very uncomfortable.<br>
 18_Bon, great comment!<br>
(On an unrelated note an incompetent black bank teller at my bank screwed up my deposit. She is usually not there, it is usually young White women there.)</p>
