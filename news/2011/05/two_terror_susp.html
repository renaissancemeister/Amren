<h1><a href="http://www.examiner.com/law-enforcement-in-national/two-terror-suspects-nailed-by-nypd">Two Terror Suspects Arrested by NYPD</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Kouri, Examiner, May 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New York City undercover detectives arrested two male suspects who purchased weapons as part of an alleged terror plot to impersonate Jewish worshippers in synagogues and then randomly murder members of the congregations by planting an improvised explosive device (IED), a police source told the Law Enforcement Examiner.</p>
<p>The suspects were identified as 26-year old Ahmed Ferhan and 21-year old Mohamed Mamdouh both of North African. They were alleged to have said they planned to attack the Empire State Building, as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the men  &mdash;  one naturalized citizen and the other a legal immigrant  &mdash;  were arrested Wednesday immediately after purchasing weapons from an undercover detective.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New York City is no stranger to terrorist attacks. The city has been victim to radical Hispanic terrorists (FALN), radical leftists such as the Weather Underground, and the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. The largest terrorist attack in U.S. history on September 11, 2001 occurred in Manhattan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials described the pair as Islamist extremists, but said they were &#8220;lone wolves&#8221; not connected to any formal group such as al-Qaeda.</p>

		<p>The media is absolutely doing this &#8220;lone wolf&#8221; thing to death!  Now, two men working in concert are lone wolves!  Huh?!  Anything to try to deny that such people are Moslem terrorists!  If an immediate, direct link cannot be made to Al Quaida, then such men are declared to be working alone in an isolated incident, unrelated to any previous incident or terror group.  <br>
Note that the article DOES try to forge a link between Islamic terrorism and that done by a Hispanic group and the Weather Underground, as though to lose all significance in the shuffle. And the mention of 9/11 as though it were just another inconvenient car bombing in NYC!   </p>

		<p>Back before we abandoned all sense as reason (oil rich Iraq for hole AfG), I proposed on a couple military forums a strict &#8216;certificated supplier&rsquo; equivalent system wherein all (predominantly Saudi at the time) volunteer suicidists who came from a given passport issuing state would be covered under a mandatory insurance policy of not less than 1 million dollars per terrorist, per victim or agency (oil, water, electrical etc.) that was damaged.  _Even if they were subsequently naturalized as citizens of other states_.</p>
<p>The country of origin would also be responsible for issuing a public apology in the name of the ruling group or administration for the issuance of a passport &#8216;to a terrorist operative&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fines would double if the terrorist was a &#8216;known operative&rsquo; on a Watch List.</p>
<p>Any refusal would result in a shut down of ALL export/import trade to that country, until they redressed the balance.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a lot easier when you have fixed border entry points for legitimate traffic and vastly fewer travelers than the thousands who daily penetrate to the heart of NYC on flying bombs.</p>
<p>But with the right (48hr passenger preclear notification before international flights) infrastructure, the principle should work the same and would go a _long ways_ towards encouraging even back of beyond republics like &#8216;Sweden&rsquo; to reconsider sending their sociopaths to our country under state passports.</p>
<p>I mean _seriously_ people!</p>
<p>Sometimes public embarrassment -and- punitive reparations are necessary to make the right people at the right policy-execution level create a system that prevents their own wallets from being lightened as passive terrorist supporters.</p>
<p>Pair of &#8216;kronjons&rsquo; not withstanding, someday, this kind of &#8220;Two men and a suitcase nuke&hellip;&#8221; operation will really hurt us.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but chuckle at the thought of these two characters outfitting themselves in false eye glasses fitted with large plastic noses and huge moustaches then trying to &#8220;infiltrate&#8221; a synagogue while loudly saying &#8220;Oy vey!,&#8221; &#8220;my brother can get it for you wholesale,&#8221; &#8220;Such a deal,&#8221; or &#8220;stop kvetching.&#8221;</p>
<p>Truly, Al Queda terrorists at their finest.</p>

<p>I see that there are radical left-wings groups listed, but no right-wing groups.  Hmm&hellip;and conservatives are the extremists?  Yeah, right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Officials described the pair as Islamist extremists, but said they were &ldquo;lone wolves&rdquo; not connected to any formal group such as al-Qaeda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every time this happens, whether its one or a hundred, they are always &#8220;lone wolves&#8221;.  But, they ARE connected to one group&hellip;&hellip;..Islam.</p>

		<p>The leftist airport security guidelines maybe called for a blonde 8-year-old from Georgia to be searched, while these human roaches walked through with a wink from the PC squad.</p>
<p>Just a guess.</p>
<p>Searching them wouldn&rsquo;t help anyway as they probably got their presumed lethality from their fellows already here.</p>

		<p>These two lone wolves bought a gun and planned to attack the Empire State Building? Good thing they were stopped. Obama is doing his job, like W used to. Our future looks bright. Oh yeah, baby! </p>
