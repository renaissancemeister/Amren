			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, May 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Muslim mothers have been arrested after allegedly killing their daughters for dishonoring the family by eloping with Hindu men, police in northern India said Sunday.</p>
<p>Newlyweds Zahida, 19, and Husna, 26, were strangled when they returned home after getting married to men of their choice, said Anil Kumar Kusan, a police officer.</p>
<p>Marriages between Hindus and Muslims are not common in India and are frowned upon by both communities, although there are more instances of inter-religious marriages among the educated urban population.</p>
<p>Across India, many marriages are still arranged by families. But with the booming economy and more women entering the work force, such traditions are slowly giving way to love marriages.</p>
<p>However, centuries-old caste and community barriers still come into play, and there has been a spurt in &#8220;honor killings&#8221; in recent years across northern India.</p>
<p>Zahida and Husna were neighbors in Baghpat, a town in India&rsquo;s Uttar Pradesh state, when they fell in love with two construction workers. They eloped and got married last week before returning home to make peace with their families, Kusan said.</p>
<p><b>Shame</b></p>
<p>The girls belonged to Muslim families and their mothers, both widows, were furious, Kusan said.</p>
<p>Police believe that the mothers helped each other to strangle the girls.</p>
<p>The mothers were unrepentant saying the girls had brought shame and dishonor to their families, police said.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s that &#8220;Religion of Peace(tm)&#8221; again. What other religion regards killing their own children as the normal response to family discord? It is true that here in the U.S.A. we have an occasional loser that wipes out his whole family, but I&rsquo;ve generally not heard of a religious justification for these tragic crimes. It also seems that killing is an acceptable response to almost any problem for some Muslims. Someone draws a picture of Mohammed-Kill, your daughter dresses in western fashions-kill, your wife wants a divorce-kill. Kill,kill,kill.</p>

		<p>But Bush told us Islam was a &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;. I wonder what sort of &#8220;religion&#8221; induces people to murder their own adult daughters? <br>
Also in the news regarding this &#8220;religion&#8221;, now that the Egyptians have gotten some freedom they&rsquo;ve immediately begun to launch large scale attacks on the Christian community. Freedom for muslims apparently means a green light to attack all non-muslims with the goal of wiping them out.<br>
The pattern repeats everywhere. Pick up a non-PC history book and take a look at what Islam is really like.   </p>

		<p>What Mulims and Hindus do to each other is of little concern to me.  This is, however, proof of the old saying &#8220;Diversity equals death&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is nonsense!  If you are trying to make a point, then please express it so others can understand.  This single question that you ask makes sense to no one but you.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter was an idiot, and possibly evil. But as far as I know, he never murdered his daughter.</p>
<p>I also think we should never call these kind of killings &#8220;honor killings&#8221;. They are premeditated, cold blooded murder.</p>

		<p>There are many people who argue that Islam&rsquo;s treatment of women is a good reason for the wars against the Middle East, as the West will be able to liberate the women. But this case is a good example of the fact that many Muslim women support Islam&rsquo;s views on women. In India, these women are at least being prosecuted for the murders. If they lived in a country that practiced the Sharia, they&rsquo;d probably get away with it, and enjoy a lot of support from the community. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;Religion of peace&#8221; strikes again. Where are all the libs now that the daughters of a &#8220;loving&#8221; Muslim family are killed by their MUSLIM mothers? Not a mainstream friendly story, so it will be buried, unless one seeks to find it on the internet. If they call you a &#8220;racist&#8221; embrace this. </p>

		<p>This is unbelievable and reaches far beyond a premeditated, cold murder. There is no tighter bond than that of a mother and a child. For a woman to murder her own child is simply not human. It tells me everything i need to know about this evil, satanic cult called islam.</p>

		<p>I recently watched &#8216;The Stoning of Saroya M&rsquo;. Magnificent film technically but so disturbing, I needed 3 sessions to watch it. <br>
Father vs daughter; husband vs wife; brother vs sister; son vs mother! Hard to accept from a western point of view. These Muslim customs just can&rsquo;t be justified IMHO.</p>

		<p>Jimmy Carter is a religious fanatic who, as President, allowed Castro to send many of his criminals and lunatics to America.  Some of these &#8220;refugees&#8221; killed Americans.  Carter was willing to allow this to happen because of his Christian beliefs.</p>

<p>I remember reading accounts by Phyllis Chesler and Betty Mahmoody about their lives in Islamic countries that they received the worst treatment at the hands of other women.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling said it almost 150 years ago: </p>

		<p>STUPID girls is all I can say, they KNEW what might and likely would happen and yet they returned home &#8220;to make peace&#8221; with their families&hellip;This happens often in muslim families, the girls want to make everything ok with their families and end up murdered.</p>

<p><br>
As I said, Jimmy Carter was an idiot.  I don&rsquo;t think he was really a Christian.  He was and still is, an egotistical self-serving politician, who grew up in a &#8220;social church tradition&#8221;.  He learned to use &#8216;church words&rsquo; when they were of benefit to him. Most people like this are fooled by their self-righteousness, and will usually do whatever they choose. But to call him a fanatic is to stretch the word out of shape and cause it to loose it&rsquo;s meaning.</p>
<p>I believe you would be better calling him either a communist/socialist or a puppet of someone else.</p>

<p>Why not <b>all of the above</b>?</p>
<p>I fully agree with Tom in MI.  Jimmy Carter was a spaced-out, zonked-out, wide-eyed fanatic   &mdash;   just as was his mother, Miz Lilian before him. (Remember her going off to  &#8220;do good&#8221; in India?)  He behaved (and still does) as if he is not of this world.  As a president, he was a disaster to the USA.</p>

		<p>Re: 15 Browser</p>
<p>I agree with your assessment of Carter. (As a president, he was a disaster to the USA.)</p>
<p>Perhaps I am guilty of the same thing I was critical about. I haven&rsquo;t made myself clear.</p>
<p>I am trying to separate Carter from Christianity. Many people do many things in the name of Christianity, when it is not commanded by the Bible. Just because someone calls themselves a christian, or wants to be a do-gooder, does not mean they are truly christian, or that their actions are christian. And as best as I can judge from Carter&rsquo;s actions, he is no christian.</p>
<p>I am not trying to start an argument, but I am attempting to defend Christianity.</p>

		<p>Probably had a lot more to do with the dowry payments demanded by the grooms and their families than ire at marrying outside their religion.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised to find that the muslim families have a lot more money than the hindu families and the girls were seduced and eloped with to get big dowries.</p>
<p>There are many traditions of girls being either seduced or kidnapped into marriage by men who want their families to come up with generous dowries.</p>
<p>The muslim families didn&rsquo;t want to pay the dowries so they killed the brides.  It is a lot more merciful than the hindu custom of burning the brides to death when the dowry payments fall behind.</p>
<p>The hindus are more clever about it.  The wife murders are always classified as kitchen fires by the authorities.  The muslims can&rsquo;t explain away the knife wounds.</p>
<p>These are the cultures the feminazis extoll and praise while denouncing Christianity and Western civilization.</p>
