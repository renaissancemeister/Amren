			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, May 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of albinos are thought to have been killed for black magic purposes in Tanzania and albino girls are being raped because of a belief they offer a cure for AIDS, a Canadian rights group said on Thursday.</p>
<p>At least 63 albinos, including children, are known to have been killed, mostly in the remote northwest of the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is belief that if you have relations with a girl with albinism, you will cure AIDS. So there are many girls with albinism who are being raped in this country because of this belief, which is a false belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around 1.4 million Tanzanians among a population of 40.7 million have the HIV virus that leads to AIDS.</p>
<p>Albino hunters kill their victims and harvest their blood, hair, genitals and other body parts for potions that witchdoctors say bring luck in love, life and business.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Activists last week reported three murders of teenage albino boys from the same family in northern Tanzania, who were poisoned and their bones later robbed from their graves.</p>
<p>The Tanzanian government says it is determined to halt the macabre killings, but has been widely criticized for inaction.</p>

		<p>I truly feel sorry for these Africans Albinos. </p>
<p>The sad irony is that skin color is the only reason why they are being slaughtered and discriminated against. It is hard enough that many will become deaf, blind, or die due to no melanin and existing in one of the hottest regions of the world, Africa. There is a reason why dark skin evolved there.</p>
<p>Fake victims (African Americans) always cry for attention while true victims get none (African Albinos).</p>

HIV/AIDS, the stats, the virgin cure and infant rape </p>
<p>http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm</p>
<p><br/>
21,000 child rapes, and some 37,000 adult rapes, were reported in South Africa last year (2001). According to the South African Police Service, only one in 35 are actually reported. The actual incidence of rape could well be in excess of a million per year. It can only be speculated and extrapolated then that the actual incidence of child/infant rape has reached alarming and phenomenal proportions that should signal urgent intervention from the highest levels of government, and society-at-large.</p>

<p>Yes, but not in South Africa where they&rsquo;re more scientifically advanced.  They believe raping a virgin&hellip;even if it&rsquo;s an infant&hellip;will cure aids.</p>
<p>Africans, however, are even more advanced regarding their economic concepts, for example, many believe if they pour a concrete runway the white man will fly his plane in with a briefcase full of money, and, of course their monetary policy is based on that.</p>
<p>And, their air force is also advanced.  If you lift the hood on one of their airplane engines, you&rsquo;ll note that each one has a rubber band twisted super-tight, because they believe in constructing only the best.</p>

		<p>Juju or muti, depending on where you are located. Even in the modern age, witchcraft is an integral and important part of African life. Always has been, always will be.</p>

<p>So rape is now called &#8216;having relations?&rsquo; Or is that just the new African definition of rape according to this &#8216;Canadian Rights Group?&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The hate of anything WHITE. </p>
<p>Cant you see? </p>
<p>Thats why hell is the dark side or black side as the WHITE man religion says who represents the WHITE race where everything good is WHITE.</p>
<p>White ropes? White crosses? White robes? White house? </p>
<p>If the nergroids had been hanged with black ropes it would be a non-event. <br/>
Had black crosses been burned it would be a non-even and same with black robes.</p>
<p>Why were ropes made white anyway since they get dirty? Hemp is dark not white.</p>
<p>Why are crosses white since the peasant messiah cross was certainly not but probably black? </p>
<p>Regardless its white white white that is hated.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re after &#8220;the white man&rsquo;s juju&#8221; yet again. Because it doesn&rsquo;t get much whiter than albino, now does it?<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I think Tanzania should issue a Travel Advisory for Johnny and Edgar Winter. </p>

		<p>I think this is just an excuse to rape someone with white skin.  If there aren&rsquo;t Caucasians around, this is the next &#8220;best&#8221; thing.  Scary to think what the result might be if our loose immigration policies were followed to their natural conclusion&hellip;.wait&hellip;.that scenario is already being played out. Never mind.  </p>
<p>I do feel terribly sorry for these victims, however.</p>
