<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2011/05/racial_incident_in_texas_schoo.html">&#8216;Racial Incident&rsquo; in Texas School Plunges City into Turmoil</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Paulin, American Thinker, May 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s being called an ugly &#8220;racial incident.&#8221; As a consequence, Bastrop, Texas, a city of about 8,000 near the capital of Austin, is in turmoil. And a school principal&rsquo;s career is in jeopardy. </p>
<p>[The] well-intentioned principal of Bastrop Middle School, Teri Watson, did what liberal lawmakers and government bureaucrats have done for years. She tried to help some of her students by identifying them as members of an underachieving racial group  &mdash;  rather than as underachieving individuals.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Watson became alarmed upon noticing a troubling trend: Black students as a group were doing far worse academically than other racial and ethnic groups at Bastrop Middle School. Watson, to be sure, had a very good reason for analyzing academic achievement and underachievement based on racial and ethnic groups. That&rsquo;s one way the state itself defines how public schools are performing. Indeed, under the state&rsquo;s own criteria, all racial and ethnic groups must be performing above a certain level. And if one groups falls below acceptable levels, then the entire school&rsquo;s certification and funding are put in jeopardy.</p>
<p>What to do about her badly performing black students whose poor grades posed potentially negative consequences for her school&rsquo;s accreditation? One day last February, Watson took action. Over the school&rsquo;s intercom, a number of eighth grade students were summoned by name to the library. All had one thing in common: They were black.</p>
<p>Facing the group, Watson, who is white, reportedly gave them something of a pep talk. She said &#8220;they need to pull together and help each other study to improve their schools,&#8221; said Catina White-Higgins, a parent whose daughter Felicity was in the group. Watson &#8220;had a chart to show them where their scores were low.  &hellip;   [My daughter] said it made her feel like she was nothing, that she was in trouble. It made her feel bad,&#8221; she told the Austin American-Statesman, a daily newspaper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
The day after Watson&rsquo;s pep talk, the school sent letters to parents apologizing for her conduct. In addition, the school district&rsquo;s superintendent wrote a letter of apology to the community, published in The Bastrop Advertiser, which said Watson had acted improperly, had &#8220;apologized profusely,&#8221; and he indicated that black students were doing poorly due to the &#8220;school&rsquo;s academic shortcomings.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough for aggrieved black parents and students in Bastrop. The city is now experiencing the sort of turmoil that inevitably arises when such &#8220;racial incidents&#8221; occur in post-racial America. </p>
<p>Responding to angry black parents, the school board is implementing a &#8220;diversity plan&#8221; that among other things will affect future hiring and training.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>Watson, a veteran educator, is a native of Bastrop and active in community affairs. Yet the hurt she inflicted upon her black students  &mdash;  all for telling them the truth  &mdash;  may prove her undoing. Some black parents are calling for Watson&rsquo;s head. {snip}</p>
<p>Last Tuesday evening, black parents and their children held a protest march, walking from a local church to a school board meeting, with some repeating calls for Watson&rsquo;s dismissal. She remains on the job, however.</p>
<p>Would there have been any black outrage if Watson had not been white but black? Better still, what if somebody else had taken Bastrop&rsquo;s black students to task for their lousy grades  &mdash;  say Bill Cosby, Henry Louis &#8220;Skip&#8221; Gates, or even President Obama? {snip}</p>
<p>One wonders what new &#8220;diversity&#8221; programs Bastrop&rsquo;s school district will implement. If they&rsquo;re anything like the social engineering programs created by liberal lawmakers and bureaucrats over the years, they may end up creating more problems than they solve.</p>

		<p> - and he indicated that black students were doing poorly due to the &ldquo;school&rsquo;s academic shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then how would that explain why black students as a group were doing FAR WORSE academically than other racial and ethnic groups at this school? If the school had &#8220;academic shortcomings&#8221;, wouldn&rsquo;t ALL the others be doing poorly also?</p>
<p>My advice to the school district&rsquo;s superintendent - grow a pair and stop apologizing to these idiot black parents, they&rsquo;re the ones with the &#8220;academic shortcomings&#8221;, not your school!    </p>

My sister was teaching third grade. On the day of the test, one black boy was absent. When he came in the next day, my sister had him take the test. Across the hall was a second grade classroom. The room was empty so my sister let the black boy take the test in the empty second grade classroom. My sister did this because in her own white mind, she was helping the boy by letting him take the test without distraction.</p>
<p>Can you guess what happened next?</p>
<p>My sister gets a call at home from the angry parent. &#8216;How DARE you HUMILIATE MY SON by putting him in a second grade classroom?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A parent-teacher meeting was held where my sister was made to apologize.</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicion that black parents are grilling their children about what happened at school to find something to file a complaint about or better yet a lawsuit.</p>

<p>If all students were doing poorly then perhaps there would be some justification for talking about the &#8220;school&rsquo;s academic shortcomings.&#8221;  But if whites are doing well and blacks are doing badly just how is it the fault of the school?  Quite obviously it is the fault of the black students and their parents.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s considered to be a wicked thing, and indeed a offense that can cause one to be fired from one&rsquo;s job, to tell a black person the truth if it makes him feel bad.  That is why we are now a society of official lies and truth is buried behind closed doors.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a &#8220;trend.&#8221; It&rsquo;s a fact of life. </p>
<p>The word &#8220;trend&#8221; implies that it will somehow be magically changed in the future, whereas in reality, it&rsquo;s the same everywhere, in all school districts, in all parts of the world, throughout all of history and for all time. </p>
<p>The claim that black underachievement is just a temporary &#8220;trend&#8221; is the Big Lie that the left has foisted upon the public for decades now. Right, and the world is going to end tomorrow. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why leftism is a lot like religion: no matter how many predictions fail, new ones can always be promulgated.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m outraged! That racist principal should know that IT&rsquo;S ALWAYS THE SCHOOL&rsquo;S FAULT when black students do poorly. All the teachers of the black kids should be fired, and maybe burned at the stake along with the principal. Then, bring in Wendy Kopp and her Teach for America Ivy League Superstar Do-gooders. Before you know it, they will have raised those black kids achievement levels by two, maybe even three three percent!</p>

<p>These people and especially their parents don&rsquo;t understand it when someone does something to try to help them if it involves anything other than praising their sick, black egos.</p>
<p>This foolish white principal gullibly bought into the leftist mantra that blacks are equal, mentally, to all the other races.</p>
<p>It is those same radical leftists who are mandating minimums on grading, which are impossible to meet unless a lot of cheating is done, as in the Atlanta and DC school districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;No Child Left Behind&#8221; will work only if the standard is dumbed down to the black average.  And, since education has already been dumbed down to the point where the US went from the top of the list in most every subject to last or near the bottom right now, any further slippage in requirements would mean US students would be on a par with Sub-Saharan Africans.  </p>
<p>It is as the Japanese PM said a while back, in essence: &#8220;The US will not be able to compete in the 21st century, because it has too many blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there anybody left out there, except the fairies in LaLa land, who still think we are not heading toward a totally dysfunctional society and probable breakup?</p>

		<p>What few mention about diversity is that it causes total distrust among all people involved. If you&rsquo;re white, you&rsquo;re wondering if the black guy over there is going to treat you differently because you&rsquo;re white; if you&rsquo;re black, you&rsquo;re wondering if the white people over there are going to treat you differently because you&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>As a result, black parents tend to over-react to white corrections at school (white parents are too brainwashed to do the same). Was my son singled out because he&rsquo;s an academic failure, or from white racism? Since just about every movie, news report and public interview blames white racism, they assume that &#8220;has to&#8221; factor in.</p>
<p>Diversity cannot work for this reason and about ten thousand other reasons. Obviously, it&rsquo;s not working for these black kids. Their scores are still terrible and the school&rsquo;s just covering up the problem.</p>

		<p>There is one thing to note:</p>
<p>If and when the Marxists succeed in taking over this country, this kind of PC silliness will stop immediately.  The only reason this is happening now is because it facilitates what the left is trying to do.</p>
<p>Once the left is in power, the blacks will be stripped of their privileges and put in their place as serfs.  Guaranteed.  And I think it will serve them right for their arrogance.</p>

		<p>I had an occasion to be at a middle school for a day. It is one of the better schools in my area. What I witnessed was black boys and black girls who were totally out of control. Teachers were spending up to 70 percent of their time trying to restore order in their classrooms. It was so bad I told one teacher I would shed a tear for her when I got home.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even the fault of the black students or their parents.  It&rsquo;s the fault of the misguided, liberal, educational  establishment that can&rsquo;t acknowledge the obvious: that Black students will not &#8220;catch-up&#8221; under any model of education.  I do believe that it&rsquo;s within the realm of possibility that Black students could perform better in school and grow into adults who, for the most part, perform useful jobs in the economy and stay out of serious trouble.  I do not believe it&rsquo;s possible to close the racial achievement gap in academic subjects that require the races to have substantially equal intelligence.  The failure is on the part of society as whole (this group excluded) to accept reality and make the best of it. </p>

		<p>If this was a group of under-performing white students nothing would appear in the press. But poor beleaguered black students who, for some reason, cannot perform academically need to be coddled or their feelings are hurt!! Aw shucks! no worry as affirmative action, the lowering of entrance standards and the like, will ensure their progression unabated by such trivialities as being able to read and do basic math. Let the extreme dumbing down continue.</p>

		<p>As a former and future teacher of black students I have learned this.  They are the hardest working, most intelligent, and overall outstanding students that could ever exist.  Any failings on their part are directly the fault of institutional racism or that teacher.  Deviate from that group thinking that and you are in big trouble and probably on the way out.</p>

		<p>Expecting blacks or other non-whites to behave and perform at the standards of Western (i.e. White) Civilization is the very definition of modern racism.  So, yes, this principle is indeed racist.  Since it&rsquo;s socially unacceptable or outright illegal to hold blacks or non-whites accountable there is only one logical solution:  lower or remove all together the standards of Western civilization.   Globalist Banksters have been the driving impetus behind the entire forced integration/&#8221;civil rights&#8221; movement and the erasure of Western civilization has been their goal. </p>

		<p>Look, everyone, I am as patriotic as the next and maybe more. But really, this country is ridiculous. I know times are tough, but they are going to get tougher. Whether it&rsquo;s $25 or $250 a month, we all need to begin putting some cash away because sooner or later we are going to have to run for our lives. Probably sooner rather than later. I know a lot of you think it will turn itself around, that our time is coming. It isn&rsquo;t. It didn&rsquo;t for South Africans. They had to run, or be raped and robbed, and sometimes all of the above. It may seen &#8220;off topic&#8221; but it isn&rsquo;t. The point being that minorities will take anything to be &#8220;racist&#8221; and use it to chuck you from your job and make you unemployable. Getting another good job will be onerous. So save while you have time. As much as you are able. Don&rsquo;t look to gold or survival gear or a mountaintop somewhere in Wyoming. This whole country is a madhouse waiting to erupt. Start looking at foreign options. Some places are still viable. East Europe, (oddly) Argentina (which has a huge white population but no organized anti-white legislation), maybe others. None of us have much time left. Get busy preparing for it.</p>

		<p>As a teacher of 20 years I can tell you that blacks only perform worse than whites because their whole lives they have had no black role models. Everything they learn is about brilliant white philosophers, brilliant white explorers, brilliant white scientists and inventors. We need to rebuild their self esteem so they can overcome the legacy of slavery and racism in this country. Affirmative action is just a small start all blacks should get automatic A grades in every class and test, free admission to any college they wish, and all tuition paid for by the state. Then they should have their choice of job and not have to go through any interviews, simply claim it. Finally once employed, it should be impossible to fire them even if they do no work whatsoever. Its worked for the American automotive workers and it will work for other types of business as well. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m amused when people such as Ms Watson get themselves into a pickle of their own making. As a matter of fact, I hope she&rsquo;s fired. But whether or not she&rsquo;s fired isn&rsquo;t the point. I think such people as Ms Watson are beyond redemption. She&rsquo;s probably deluded beyond and help. But her problem will definitely be helpful to those White people who might not be so brainwashed.<br>
All in all, this type of thing is good for our cause.</p>

		<p>Two years ago, while counseling at an all-minority high school in a crime-ridden Eastern city, I was sent a freshman boy with a virulent stomach virus. (We had no school nurse.)Once inside my office, this boy proceeded to vomit all over my carpet - and then my pants and my shoes. I quickly grabbed a wastepaper basket for this black child to puke in, and then I held his head while he threw up. When his mother refused to come and pick the boy up, I drove him home. (He vomited into a paper bag the whole way.)It took her 20 minutes to answer the front door (It was 11:45 and she&rsquo;d been sleeping). She was NOT pleased to see either her son OR me. But guess what? (Yep, you guessed it!) The next morning, both she and her baby-daddy of the moment were in the principal&rsquo;s office, screaming that I had disrespected her black child by &#8220;sticking his head in a trashcan.&#8221; She demanded an apology (and, I suspect, a lawsuit.) To her credit, the principal did NOT make me apologize &#8220;except to say that it would make my job much easier.&#8221; I finally told the boy&rsquo;s mother, &#8220;I am sorrier than I can say that I did what I did for your son. I can assure you that if it ever happens again, I won&rsquo;t go anywhere near him.&#8221; The moron was somewhat mollified by this veiled insult and went away grumbling loudly about white teachers who think they can disrespect poor black children and get away with it.</p>
<p>I quit that afternoon.</p>

		<p>Allowing non-whites to go to school with Whites in the first place was the main mistake. It has been downhill ever since and will continue to further degrade.</p>
<p>But the sad truth is, not enough Whites cared enough to fight against it back in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. The majority of Whites had other things on their mind which were of higher priority. And certainly most would have never done what it would have taken to stop it. So then to ease their mind that they had failed their children in their duty to them, they believed the propaganda that it would all work out for the best in the end.</p>
<p>Everything the &#8220;evil racists&#8221; said would happen back in the 60/70&rsquo;s if we allowed the non-whites into the schools has now come to pass.</p>
<p>And now we reap what we sow.</p>

		<p>The only way to put a stop to these kinds of &#8220;racial incidents&#8221; is for a group of us to band together and financially support the attorney&rsquo;s fees that will go with a lawsuit when someone &#8220;grows a pair and stands up&#8221;. We all know the Rosa Parks incident was planned, staged, and executed by a group to achieve a specific goal. A minority of blacks continue to work together to financially support their agenda but even WE, the racially conscious whites on this site, do not band together- we just complain. If I were the principal, I&rsquo;d do the same thing because no one would support me either.</p>

		<p>Start looking at foreign options. Some places are still viable. East Europe, (oddly) Argentina (which has a huge white population but no organized anti-white legislation), maybe others. None of us have much time left. Get busy preparing for it.says poster 21.<br>

<p>I agree with most of your post. Things are never going to get better for Whites here OR all over the world. </p>
<p>Europe is as bad as America. Many of us barely survive now. Many of us are trying to live off our SSA income after working 40 years. There is no way we can move across the street and be able to pay the rent, let alone come up with deposits etc.</p>
<p>Moving out of the country is impossible and counter productive, but what really irks me is that many think we SHOULD give up our land without a fight and concede to these nonwhites (aliens to our race) everything that our ancestors WORKED for and built what WE worked for and built! NO WAY! This is our land and to turn tail and run is not in our blood and never should be.</p>
<p>Jose nor Jamal is never going to make me give it all away to their selfish, racist and hateful race!  We all know what is coming soon and we will die or survive on our feet or stay on our knees and beg for mercy. Which is it, people? We no longer have a choice but to survive! </p>
<p>As for all the traitors of our race and the race mixers, they will surely pay dearly for all the blood on their own hands. Either from OUR own &#8220;court&#8221; or from God&rsquo;s court. I will bank on God&rsquo;s court.</p>

		<p>My 50th high school reunion will be celebrated in September, this year.  Of the blacks who graduated with from my school none attend the reunion&hellip;why?  </p>
<p>We were integrated and thought nothing of it, and we all did the same studies, same teachers, same requirements, but that was fifty years ago&hellip;back before the government passed laws about blacks and other minorities being dumb.  Needing special attention and needing one trillion dollars to make them less useful.</p>
<p>By design your government has denegrated this country in every respect, and all the people within have become less than before.</p>

<p>Anonymous, how old are you? It actually got started in the 50&rsquo;s. <br>
Whites weren&rsquo;t complacent, they didn&rsquo;t have things of a higher priority on their minds, they were bullied and brainwashed by the press. </p>
<p>Night after night on the TV, pictures of &#8220;evil&#8221; screaming  Southerners, well dressed Black people marching for their &#8220;rights,&#8221; and on and on. It was all propaganda. No internet back then. </p>
<p>I think one the traits we Whites have is that generally we want to be nice and do the right thing. That can work if we&rsquo;re dealing with one another, but not with other races and cultures alien to us. </p>
<p>Anyway, the Northern city I was born in is gone, the town I was raised in is gone, and soon the whole state will be pretty much gone, too. In case you&rsquo;re wondering, it&rsquo;s New Jersey. It used to be a nice civilized place to live and raise children.   </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s insane to think that the school had &#8220;immediately apologized for Watson&rsquo;s conduct&#8221; A teacher apologized for giving a pep talk to students?  We are really living in a backwards world.  When I was young you didn&rsquo;t even look at the teacher with any type of face.  It&rsquo;s all the result of cultural marxism here, and as a white person I feel disgusted to see fellow whites groveling, bowing and scraping to this insanity.  The needy, indigent group directing, berating, and manipulating the group that utterly supports them, children more respected than parents and ruling their parents, women turning away from their children and husbands towards careerism (many times against their inclination), and the law turned on it&rsquo;s head - caring more for the criminals than the injured party.  If that is not a society turned totally on it&rsquo;s head, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

		<p>Withhold the truth that someone has a terrible, fatal, but -treatable- disease and you are guilty of negligence.  Withhold the truth that people with a mean IQ of 87 cannot talk on a level with those of a mean IQ of 100 and you are exercising common sense.<br>
The sad part is that refusing to discuss genetics in black failings at everything (crime, poverty, family life) is what the rabid social engineers and globalists use as a &#8216;racist&rsquo; excuse to keep us from moving up the ladder as well.  Because it creates docile, stupid, herd populations that can be stampeded one way and then another without any real awareness of what is being engineered.<br>
If we want to avoid being &#8216;talked down to&rsquo; by leadership who continually lie to and manipulate us, we need to talk about a 120 IQ -for everyone-.</p>
<p>And getting there is possible.  Only with applied genetics.</p>

		<p>In part, this is the result of 100IQs (or better) talking down to 87IQs who naturally assume that every criticism is a threat to their status as something and is overtly hostile because of that.  They do not believe in a therapeutic or remedial reason to apply criticism.</p>
<p>However; the majority of what is going on is nothing more than Blacks for Blacks.  In this, I see blacks the same way I see unions.</p>
<p>Anything and everything that &#8216;hurts the Local&rsquo; is going to be attacked and reviled for any and all possible reasons (and some that are just plain silly&hellip;).  Hoping to saturate the attacker and derail or distract the original intent of the perceived affront.</p>
<p>This is a standard tribalist defense mechanism where the benefits of the individual lie with supporting a group that in turn defends it&rsquo;s &#8216;honor&rsquo; as their own.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen with socially altruistic whites who have been taught, ceaselessly, to always look for balanced views in defending or opposing a given point of view and particularly one which is racial.</p>
<p>This is to our betterment amongst our own because it allows us to take the wider view of what&rsquo;s good for all and improve, incrementally, by adopting elements of outside views.  The &#8216;nobody is ever completely right or wrong&rsquo; psychology is really killing us however in contact with tribalist races (including Asian and Hispanic ones as well).</p>
<p>The problem obviously comes when the outsiders have absolutely nothing to offer and yet demand the same integrative welcome and rewards.</p>
<p>This would not happen in an all white school within an all white nation.  Parents would look at the actions of their children as pupils first, individuals last and race never.</p>
<p>We will never escape this kind of deliberate ignorance in an integrated America.  Racial Politics rules every response.</p>
