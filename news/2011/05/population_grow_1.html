			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Harry Wallop, Telegraph (London), May 18, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Figures published by the Office for National Statistics have shown that between 2001 and 2009 the population of England and Wales increased by 2.45 million to 54.8 million. </p>
<p>However, the numbers of white British people actually fell by 36,000 in that period, while the group of people the ONS classify as non-&#8216;white British&rsquo;, increased from 6.64 million to 9.13 million. This group includes everyone from Chinese, black African, Pakistani, mixed white and black Caribbean as well as Australian, Canadian and European. </p>
<p>The proportion of the population in England and Wales that is from an ethnic minority group has increased from 13 per cent in 2001 to 17 per cent in 2009. </p>
<p>The figures have once again opened up the debate over whether levels of immigration were too high over the last decade. Of the 2.45 million extra people in the country, 1.75 million came from net migration, while 733,900 came from births. </p>
<p>The net migration figure would have been far higher had the white British population not suffered from a net migration fall, with 396,000 more white Britons leaving the country than returning. </p>
<p>David Green, the chief executive of the think tank Civitas, said: &#8220;There are a number of reasons why these figures demonstrate why we should never again allow such a big influx in such a short period of time. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are a crowded country. If you bring in people at a greater rate than the number of jobs created you will drive down wage growth, and that tends to hit salaries at the lower end of the income scale. </p>
<p>&#8220;And our infrastructure has just failed to adjust quickly enough. Most immigrants are young, many with children. This is one of the reasons why schools and midwives have been under pressure in recent years.&#8221; </p>
<p>However, other experts said the growing number of immigrants would play a crucial role in helping to fund Britain&rsquo;s ageing population. Omar Khan, head of policy research at The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said: &#8220;Other European nations, such as Germany and Italy, are now seeing their populations fall as they age, which is a worry for the future of their economies. Given these trends, Britain&rsquo;s increasing diversity should be viewed as a success, because it means that we will have enough younger workers to ensure our older population has a dignified retirement. </p>
<p>&#8220;We may yet find that these ethnic minority Britons also move to Spain or Australia when they retire, but for the medium to long term, they are a vital and contributing part of our society. Let&rsquo;s not forget that Tesco, Marks and Spencer and easyJet were all founded by migrants or their children.&#8221; </p>
<p>The fastest growing ethnic minority group, in percentage terms, was Chinese, which jumped from 233,000 to 451,000 over the period. </p>
<p>London, whose population was already made up of 40.4 per cent ethnic minorities in 2001, hardly changed its composition in the last decade with 40.5 per cent eight years later. In contrast, nearly all areas outside of London saw a dramatic change in ethnic mix. The south east, for instance, went from being compose of 8.8 per cent ethnic minorities to 14.3 per cent during the period. <br>

		<p><b>Another member of Republic, Joan Smith, says that as a white, upper-class family, Britain&rsquo;s royals are unrepresentative of modern Britain. </b></p>
<p>&#8220;I live in a country where no black person is going to be head of state, no Jewish person, certainly no openly gay person,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that&rsquo;s absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is absurd is that an Englishwoman would want a non-white Head of State.  But Tony Blair and his treasonous cohorts may have ensured that this silly woaman may well get her wish.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s over and I think the best course is to focus on what can be done for Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia.</p>

		<p>What astounds me, is where did the Brits move to? <br>
The USA? OK, maybe to escape a sick socialist government, but were they unaware that the USA is on a ROCKET RIDE to white minority?<br>
Did they not know two million mestizos trapse our border every year?<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know about other Whites, but as an American, I&rsquo;m making plans to learn Russian and relocate to Eastern Europe as soon as school is over.  We still have a chance out there, and we can educate the masses about what our countries have turned into thanks to disasterous &#8220;diversity&#8221; policies.  Plus Russia has a declining birthrate as well, and we could help them out a bit and bring something to their table..</p>

All attempts to discover the race of those entering the UK under the freedom of information act is met with the same response.. &#8220;we do not have the means to record these details..&#8221; Yeah, right!!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a horrendous figure for a European country and a continent that is the home of the White race.  Those percentages won&rsquo;t say at 83 percent either.  Whites have always been a minority in South Africa.  I think the most they ever got up to was 25 percent of the population.<br>

		<p>Patrick, I hear you, but you may want to actually visit Russia first. It has a high poverty rate, and violent gangs control almost every aspect of their economy.  It is not even safe to drive a car around. Living in Los Angeles would actually be safer than living in a Russian city.  Hopefully it will be better in the future, but right now it is very dangerous and unpleasant.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Notice that everything is valued in &#8216;economic terms&rsquo; in a world which will be on the backside of peak oil by 2015 as China becomes the dominant economic force the next year.</p>
<p>&#8216;Economies&rsquo; then will change utterly as the value of junk consumerism by a huge and largely poor, immigrant class will sink along with the value of western currencies.  _Only_ nationality (Latin: &#8216;Nascere&rsquo;, to be born) and pride in our cultural heritage has any hope of permanency.  And then only so long as we actually have a unified, homogenous, culture which holds true to it&rsquo;s values, art and integrity.  Do not expect Chinese, Pakistani or Blacks from the Caribbean or Africa to give a damn.</p>

		<p>Bear in mind that these are &#8220;official&#8221; figures - i.e. lies. The real figures, whatever they are (since nobody currently knows, including the Home Office and the ONS), are far, far higher (the evidence of your eyes tells you this in the major cities and large towns), and rapidly increasing.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between non-white British and non-&#8216;white British.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t specify it, but the non-&#8216;white British&rsquo; population includes non-indigenous Whites in Britain/UK. I&rsquo;ve looked at the UK&rsquo;s 2001 census data on ethnicity many a time, and that census, like the latest one from this year I presume, had as part of its response choices under the question asking for the respondent&rsquo;s ethnicity &#8220;White British,&#8221; &#8220;White Irish,&#8221; and &#8220;White (other);&#8221; by the census 2001 numbers, the UK had a population that was 92.1% White, but broken down, the self-identification specifically showed they were 85.67% White British, 5.27% White other, and 1.2% White Irish; in conclusion, the English, Welsh, Scottish, Manx, and Cornish population of England and Wales may be about 83% per their 2011 census, but combined with the populations in England and Wales that are Polish, Latvian, Italian, American, etc. and/or whose ancestors were all or nearly all phenotypically European, including the Irish there, the White figure is likely closer to around 88%.</p>
<p>I guess so much bad news makes you assume the worse.</p>
