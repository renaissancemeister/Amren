<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>THE face of Britain has &#8220;changed forever&#8221; after mass immigration fuelled a 40 per cent increase in the nation&rsquo;s ethnic minority population.</p>
<p>The huge rise over just eight years means more than nine million people in England and Wales  &mdash;  equivalent to one in six of the population  &mdash;  are now from a &#8220;non-white&#8221; background. The figures from the Office for National Statistics will add to criticism of Labour&rsquo;s flawed immigration policies.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, of lobby group MigrationWatch UK, said: &#8220;This rise is part of Labour&rsquo;s legacy. Whether they meant to or not, they changed the face of Britain forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if immigration continues at this rate our population will hit 70 million within 20 years and immigrants will account for half of new households. We are already feeling the pressures on maternity units and schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ONS figures show that the number of people from an ethnic minority living in Britain rose from 6.6 million in 2001 to 9.1 million in 2009 due to a rise in immigration and birth rates.</p>
<p>In contrast, the number of white Britons has remained static over the same period.</p>
<p>The largest ethnic groups in the country are Indians, who account for more than 1.4 million people living here, and Pakistanis, who represent a further one million residents.</p>
<p>The statisticians say the rise in the UK&rsquo;s Indian population, which is 380,000 up on 2001, is &#8220;primarily due&#8221; to international migration, while high birth rates are a key factor behind the combined 390,000 growth in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi populations.</p>
<p>Among the sharpest increases was the Chinese ethnic group, whose numbers have increased by 8.6 per cent a year to 450,000.</p>
<p>The number of black Africans has also rocketed since 2001, up by 300,000 or 6.2 per cent a year. This is largely attributed to people seeking asylum from Zimbabwe, Somalia, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The biggest increase over the period  &mdash;  a total of 553,000 people  &mdash;  is among the &#8220;other white&#8221; group which includes people from Eastern Europe, as well as citizens of New Zealand, Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: &#8220;The data reflects the consequences of Labour&rsquo;s &#8216;open-door&rsquo; immigration policy. </p>
<p>&#8220;Unchecked immigration has the potential to upset community cohesion and puts terrific pressure on the public purse.&#8221;</p>
<p>His point was echoed by Helen Barnard, of social affairs charity Joseph Rowntree Foundation. She pointed out that ethnic minorities often lived in poverty and relied on benefits to pull them back from the breadline. She said: &#8220;The statistics highlight the need to ensure the disproportionate number of ethnic minorities living in poverty is not allowed to grow even further.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across England, Leicester has the highest proportion of Asian Indians at 19 per cent, Bradford is next with 13 per cent of Asian Pakistani people, and 21 per cent of the residents of Tower Hamlets in London are Asian Bangladeshi.</p>
<p>The highest proportion of black Caribbean people are found in Lewisham, south-east London, followed by Birmingham. MigrationWatch UK claims that British whites will become a minority in Leicester, Birmingham, Bradford and Oldham &#8220;perhaps by 2016&#8221;.</p>
<p>The campaign group estimates that three million immigrants have arrived in Britain since 1997.<br>

								<h2><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1388472/UK-immigration-boosted-population-1-75m-8-years.html">Immigration &lsquo;Boosted the UK Population by 1.75m in Just Eight Years&rsquo;</a></h2>
						<p>The number of people from minority backgrounds who live in England and Wales went up by 2.5million in eight years, figures revealed yesterday.</p>
<p>Estimates said that 1.75million of the rise came about because of immigration, while 734,000 was the result of rising birthrates.</p>
<p>The increases meant the minority population increased by 37 per cent between 2001 and 2009.</p>
<p>According to the Office for National Statistics, one in six of the population is now from an ethnic minority or white non-British background.</p>
<p>In the eight year period studied, the population of white foreigners rose by 550,000 as Eastern Europeans and migrants from Commonwealth countries poured in. </p>
<p>Numbers grew by a further two million with people from black and Asian backgrounds thanks to immigration, rising birthrates, and asylum seeking.</p>
<p>The ONS said its figures, based on immigration counts, census data and birth and death records, had been found to tally with its existing population estimates.</p>
<p>The figures cast new light on the last Labour government&rsquo;s immigration policies, which added three million to the population between 1997 and last year.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said: &#8216;This is the legacy of Labour&rsquo;s mass immigration policy now appearing in the official figures. They have, whether deliberately or not, changed the face of Britain.</p>
<p>&#8216;If immigration continues on anything like this scale, we are heading for a population of 70million in 20 years&rsquo; time, absolutely contrary to the frequently expressed wishes of the British people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The breakdown showed a rise of just under 553,000 in the white non-British population, of which 514,000 were people who came to England and Wales as migrants. </p>
<p>These were &#8216;particularly people born elsewhere in Europe&rsquo; but there was also a large inflow from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>
<p>Much of the increase was driven by numbers from Eastern Europe, especially Poland, who arrived after Britain opened its borders when their countries joined the European Union in 2004.</p>
<p>Among black and Asian groups, the Indian population rose by 380,000 to 1.43million and the Pakistani population went up from 728,000 to top one million.</p>
<p>Because of comparatively young age profiles and higher fertility rates than among other groups, Pakistani and Bangladeshi populations were driven up by high numbers of births. </p>
<p>Numbers of black Africans in the population went up by more than 300,000 to reach nearly 800,000.</p>
<p>The ONS said one reason for this was high numbers of African asylum seekers. Its report pointed to the effect of &#8216;international migration, in particular of people from African Commonwealth countries, and from citizens of African countries, notably Zimbabwe, Somalia, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo, seeking asylum&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The fastest-growing ethnic group was of Chinese people, whose population nearly doubled to reach 452,000 in 2009.</p>
<p>The greatest concentration of black and Asian numbers was in London, where in several areas &#8216;minority&rsquo; populations make up a majority. </p>
<p>However the share of ethnic minority and white non-British in the capital stayed roughly the same, at about 40 per cent, over the eight years.</p>
<p>This is because while large numbers of immigrants arrived, many minority families joined the growing flight to suburban towns in the Home Counties.<br>

		<p>The article notes that the increase in African residents of the UK is due in part to &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; from Zimbabwe. I take that to mean *black* &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; from Zimbabwe.<br>
Britain, like the U.S., does not accept white refugees from any African country. I think that tells us all we need to know about what our politicians think of us and our culture.</p>

		<p>I do not agree that the &#8220;face of Britain has changed forever&#8221;. I would not be an active nationalist if I did believe that. It is unlikely that many of the recent arrivals have deep roots in Britain (white Commonwealth citizens are a welcome exception) and a shift in the economic or political climate would soon see them heading for greener pastures.</p>
<p>Determined attempts to enforce the law on the employment of illegal immigrants would help. Repealing the Human Rights Act which prevents the expulsion of illegal immigrants, criminal immigrants and bogus refugees would help. A change in Britain&rsquo;s absurdly generous welfare benefits to remove them from foreigners would help enormously - as the BNP chairman, Nick Griffin, said very recently &#8220;take away the jam and the wasps will go&#8221;. </p>
<p>These are just a few of the very many perfectly sensible things which a government, and not necessarily a government of the &#8220;far right&#8221;, could easily do without attracting hostile criticism from abroad, because these are the sorts of things which sensible governments do in fact implement.</p>
<p>So no need even for a nationalist government, just a moderate conservative one, and millions would flow out of the departure lounges. A nationalist government would be better because it would tackle the minorities which have been here for decades, but a moderate conservative government (not the left-of-centre liberal coalition we have at present) is much more likely in the short to medium term and then, perhaps, if it can face down the liberal press and the BBC, the face of Britain will begin to look a little more familiar again.</p>

		<p>Please, no more Great Britain! England is done, finished, stick a fork in her. She is now Muslim territory. The combination of UMC white self-hatred, NWO-BBC prop and Labour-driven prolo welfare dependency has tipped the scales. Keep investing huge amounts of emotion into your stupid local soccer games, while you move into dhimmitude (as if he Americans are any better, entranced by &#8220;bread and circuses&#8221; of non-whites capering around onscreen).

		<p>I&rsquo;ve posted here before that Britain will be the first country to go.  Events there will eventually become so bad that the country will literally fall apart at the seams.  This is why Britain is such a good example of what&rsquo;s in store for us here in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Britain is simply a larger version of Canada, Sweden, and Norway. But, hopefully, now that Labour has been thrown out, the influx will slow down. If the non-white immigrants&rsquo; birth rates are crushed lower below white Brits (easiest to do with East Asians, but Caribbean blacks are doable too) and others persuaded to leave, the problem can solve itself.</p>

		<p>How Britain Was Transformed: The Two Main Drivers(from a February article in American Renaissance):</p>
<p>&#8220;The population [of Britain] was almost entirely European until the middle of the 20th century, but that changed because of two developments. The first was the British Nationality Act of 1948, which conferred citizenship and the right to live in Britain on all members of the Commonwealth and Empire. The Commonwealth comprised Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, while the Empire consisted of the Indian sub-continent, Hong Kong, Malaysia, most of the Caribbean islands, about one third of sub-Saharan Africa, and a number of smaller territories. This act meant that huge numbers of non-Europeans &mdash; some 800 million &mdash; had the right to live and work in Britain. Curiously, the probable consequences of this act were not much debated in the House of Commons. Clement Atlee&rsquo;s Labour government simply assumed very few British subjects would take advantage of this opportunity. It was, of course, wrong. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;The second development was Britain&rsquo;s adherence to the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which allowed entry of a large number of asylum seekers. The number of non-Europeans (of all races) living in Britain recorded in the census of 1951 was 138,000. By 1971, that number had increased to 751,000, and in 2001 it was a staggering 3,450,000.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Six months ago, our new government announced a &#8216;crack-down&rsquo; on non EU immigrants. They start by &#8216;capping&rsquo; the number of highly skilled engineers who are required by UK companies who have been unable to fill their requirements due to a lack of &#8216;domestic&rsquo; applicants. What they do NOT do is start at the bottom of the pile by eradicating the tens of thousands of totally useless, uneducated, non-English speaking immigrants, most of whom remain unemployed, unemployable and totally reliant on welfare to support them from the day of arrival. Most of these are family members of those from Pakistan and Bangladesh who simply join the queue for free housing and cash hand-outs. Because they tend to have very large families, most of whom are aged, sick from TB or suffer from the many hereditary diseases caused by successive &#8216;first-cousin&rsquo; marriages demanded by their 7th century way of life, we are required to treat them, at no cost to them, through our National Health Service. The NHS is paid for by working English people by mandatory deductions from weekly pay. These immigrants pay nothing and demand everything. Human rights rears it&rsquo;s ugly head once more. 85% of muslim males in UK are unemployed. Benefit claimants are typically non-White, non-English residents who live their miserable lives moaning and groaning about their self imposed living conditions. When English people are accused of &#8216;racism&rsquo;, this is a typical example of why we think in this way. Many &#8216;african asylum seeker immigrant&rsquo; children, now in care, cost about £1400 each per week to house, clothe, feed and educate, and, because they are black, no-one wants to adopt them, especially other africans. Records prove that 85% of them will have committed serious crimes by the age of 18, costing us more in policing, court time and prison than they will ever contribute to society. But I am certain that AMREN readers will know exactly what I am describing. The UK left-wing, mainly communistic labour party, totally committed to their &#8216;rich multicultural diversity&rsquo; programme, are responsible for this chronic anti-white immigration policy and had twelve long catastrophic years to implement it. How we can resolve it without instigating drastic expulsion measures is impossible to predict&hellip;. <br>

		<p>&#8220;The only remedy is an unforgiving, pitiless policy of repatriation combined with a cast-iron moratorium on all further immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was less than one hundred years ago that the Greeks and Turks settled their differences this way.  Post World War 1, millions were repatriated from both sides. After World War 2, Dutch, Belgians, Frenchmen and numerous colonial Europeans around the globe did the repatriating, as their hosts in India, Africa and China wanted them gone.</p>
<p>It is the only serious remedy.  2 million Pakistanis and Indians can leave Britain immediately, as a start.</p>

		<p>The Labour Party&rsquo;s eternal and enduring legacy to Britain.</p>
<p>The statistics are shocking enough within themselves, the number of non-Whites in Britain is now greater than the number of Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish combined.It is also larger than the entire population of the Greater London area with the peripheral towns of the London basin thrown in (eg Reading, Watford, Dartford, Slough, Basildon etc).Britain&rsquo;s population is very heavily weighted towards the London conurbation.<br>
   The growth rate of the non-White population can only be described as phenonemal.Such a rate if continued (and there is no sign anything will change), will double the non-White population in around 15 years.Within 25 years, non-Whites will form the majority of Britain&rsquo;s population.So Britain will actually beat the USA to this much vaunted honor!</p>
<p>On another note, those of us old enough well remember the 1960s when disquiet about non-White immigration was first raised.The &#8216;official&rsquo; response was &#8220;they&rsquo;re less than 1% of the population, nothing to worry about, hardly enough to fill Wembley Stadium, old boy&#8221;.This should serve as a very grave warning to those who are lectured by the EU elitists that the north African boat-invaders are &#8216;only&rsquo; 25,000 strong.The moral is that immigration ALWAYS proceeds exponentially from a very small seed and usurps the native population in a surprisingly small time.Governments can be relied upon to lie, lie and lie all the way through.</p>

		<p>Hauntingly sad. Britain is too small a country to have to deal with such a reality. What the article doesn&rsquo;t mention is the millions of Britons who have left the country due to unchecked immigration. If such a process continues the country will look like Pakistan or Africa with a Northern European backdrop.</p>
<p>And the unbelievable reality is that most of those immigrants hate and envy Britain and whites and will do their utmost to destroy the country and what it stands for while trying to replace it with their own inferior culture. It&rsquo;s all about making money, looking for a white fool to interbreed with ( hoping they&rsquo;ll have blonde/blue-eyed offspring - &#8220;To improve our genes&#8221; ) while trying hard to proudly call themselves &#8220;British&#8221;. One of those moments in history where a great country is destroyed by pathology.</p>

		<p>&#8220;MigrationWatch UK claims that British whites will become a minority in Leicester, Birmingham, Bradford and Oldham &ldquo;perhaps by 2016&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Birmingham already exposed several years ago as being the first city in England to become majority non-white?</p>

		<p>The deal breaker (nation breaker) isn&rsquo;t the overall numbers, it is the fact that most of the &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are muslims and muslim blacks from N. Africa or just plain black trouble makers from Jamaica, Trinidad, Haiti and such. Stop the freebies and see what happens and you should believe that the result WILL NOT BE SELF DEPORTATION!!! it will be riot, mayhem, murder, robberies, rapes, looting, burning and the usual by the usual suspects. It is to late to &#8220;throw them out&#8221; no government has the balls to try and only overt, ruthless, pitiless and merciless violence is gonna get results or have any effect on these people at all&hellip;and be warned, those muslims are all to ready to inflict the previous mentioned mayhem on White British citizens and the muslims KNOW you are unarmed!</p>

		<p>Many people miss the point.</p>
<p>There is an attempt to blend all races, all nations and all religions into a &#8220;peaceful&#8221; new tan everyman.</p>
<p>That one sentence immediately above completely defines and describes what is going on.  </p>
<p>If you think I&rsquo;m right (and I am) feel free to use the terms I use. I don&rsquo;t own the terms.  I get no glory from them.  Make them yours and if enough of us speak out in the same simple and clear terms, maybe we can stop this mad genocide.</p>

		<p>I recently saw a video clip of Nick Griffin. He was making an official public appearance and trying to speak his mind. As usual, he is always well-spoken and level headed. An angry crowd surrounded him, shoulted him down, and pelted eggs at his head. Most of the crowd appeared to be white. They were not foreign thugs, but appeared to be mostly well-dressed, white collar, white people. The BBC, who covered the story, was not concered about this horrifying violation of free speech but warned that this crowd may have made Griffin a martyr. What is wrong with Britain? Why do so many white British hate themselves, and want to destroy their own country? I believe that the BNP has about 1.9% of the vote. Why not 60%? Why would you vote down your only chance at salvation?</p>

<p>If this policy of genocide doesn&rsquo;t cause a change of government, what will?  What will it take for you people to defend yourselves?  Where are the men of Britain?</p>
<p>Wake up, you&rsquo;re being colonized.  Turn off your television.  You&rsquo;re being invaded.  Right now!  Wars have been fought for so much less.  What will your grandchildren say of your inaction?</p>
<p>A nation is more than a place to make money.  A citizen is more than a piece of paper and a stamp of nationality.  Your heritage is your bloodline.  Your progeny your future.  Why import hostile alien groups to compete with your descendants?  Why give your country away?  Your ancestors bled rivers over centuries to leave this land in your hands.  Why break the chain of inheritance?</p>

		<p>Britain WILL be a majority non-White country in 30 years minimum.<br>
 Of that there is no doubt.<br>
The non-White population has reached such a magnitude that the &#8216;law of big numbers&rsquo; (ie exponential growth of a large population), is starting to kick-in.You don&rsquo;t need to be a demographer to understand that over 4% growth per annum of a baseline population of at least 10 million will reach astronomical proportions very quickly.<br>
 Alas, Great Britain a nation that shook the World for 200 years - and gave the World so much is gone, no more, finished.Not even Lazarus can raise it from the dead.</p>
<p>All this was a *DELIBERATE, MALICIOUS AND PLANNED OUTCOME* of Labour Party policies.If you don&rsquo;t believe read the famous &#8216;Andrew Neather&rsquo; article, in which that stupid man was silly enough to spill the beans on what was secret Labour Party doctrine (only for the eyes and ears of select ministers and apparatchiks, you see).The policy (ie to irreversible and irretrievably destroy White Britain for foul reasons of their own), was never, ever announced officially or in any Party manifesto - but thanks to Andrew Neather we have incontrovertible proof that such a policy did exist. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is the essence of modern British poltics.The dearest and secret wish of the politicians is to genocide the people who put them into power.</p>

		<p>Why is this freedom of immigration only present to White countries and not other countries?  Isn&rsquo;t that a little bit of a double standard?</p>

		<p><i>THE face of Britain has &ldquo;changed forever&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Racism.  Britain STOLE all these wonderful, vibrant people, and they will have to give them back to the countries to which they rightfully belong.  No amount of racist &#8220;fait accompli&#8221; thinking will change that; that would be like pretending a thief should be allowed to keep his ill-gotten gain even after he&rsquo;s been caught.</p>

		<p>I am a white born in Zimbabwe and with dual citizenship of both there and South Africa. When things got to bad I came to South Africa claiming citizenship by descent with my grandparents having been born there. As I trace my heritage my most dominant bloodline would be Dutch descent. So now I&rsquo;m juggling between countries and trying to make the best of a bad situation with no light in site at the end of the tunnel, as blacks are in charge everywhere. Here&rsquo;s the clincher. I cannot get in to Holland, the UK, France, absolutely nowhere. There&rsquo;s something very wrong with that picture while dark races inhabit all those lands and I am not allowed in! Our own have turned against us and they should be the first to be moved out of our way. Deadly serious.</p>
