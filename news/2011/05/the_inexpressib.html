<p>I have just read Jared Taylor&rsquo;s new book, <cite>White Identity.</cite> The title might lead one to expect racial ranting, but there is none. It is a good read. Jared deals thoughtfully with America&rsquo;s changing racial and ethnic make-up and the probable consequences. He is usually painted as a hate-monger who regards his bed sheets as evening wear, wants (as Lincoln did) to send blacks back to Africa, shoot Hispanics, and blame Jews for sun spots and loose fillings. Alas, he fails to perform. The book is no more extreme than Pat Buchanan, well documented, and utterly incorrect politically. His crime is asking questions one mustn&rsquo;t because the answers come up wrong.</p>
<p>For example, he doubts the existence, and the desirability, of racial integration, as very distinct from desegregation. It hasn&rsquo;t worked, he says.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this obvious? I ask my readers, most of whom are white, how many close black friends do you have? When did you last have them over for dinner? We talk mixing. We don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I lived a couple of decades in Washington, DC, a city mostly black, and had many white liberal friends. They believed they believed in multiculturalism, but they  &mdash;  we  &mdash;  lived in an overwhelmingly white world: white restaurants, friends, bars, clubs, dances. I can&rsquo;t remember even once being in an establishment in which the majority, or anything close to it, were black. Whites associate with whites, blacks with blacks. That&rsquo;s how it is.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The book is a curious one in that most of it is obvious though one mustn&rsquo;t say it. Does not diversity just cause trouble, almost everywhere? As much as one might want it to lead to comity, it doesn&rsquo;t. Consider: Shiites and Sunnis, Irish Protestants and Catholics, Hutus and Tutsis; blacks, whites and Hispanics in the US; Turks and Kurds; Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, Turks and Armenians; Indians and Ugandans; Turks and Germans; Moslems and the French; Moslems and Dutch; Jews in many places; Christians and Moslems in Sudan; Chinese and Indonesians, and so on for pages. None of these groups is evil, but none mix well. Usually they kill each other.</p>
<p>A staple of political correctness is that groups eventually merge into happy indistinguishable citizens. Occasionally, yes, if the groups are similar and want to assimilate: The Irish and Italians in the US did. Jared points out that, whatever one might wish, it usually doesn&rsquo;t happen. Sunnis and Shiites have been around since the seventh century. They celebrate diversity by exchanging car bombs. In the US, neither blacks nor Amerindians have assimilated to the dominant European culture, nor have the cultures blended.</p>
<p>Jared notes that the US now has fifty million Hispanics, or sixteen percent of the population, expected to rise soon to twice that, as well as thirteen percent of blacks. {snip}</p>
<p>Aggravating the problem is that the people who most believe that we will eventually be one big happy family are those with the least experience. They have never been in the huge, hopeless, festering slums of Detroit, Chicago, Newark, Washington, on and on and on. These are awful, culturally isolated, and not getting better. If there is an answer, no one has found it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We are what we are, a mixed nation, but need we make things worse? Unrestricted immigration may let us feel good about ourselves, but does it really have a happy ending? One may well wonder what will follow when half of the country is either black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>Further, when some groups are economically and academically way below the dominant culture, hostility and separatism become almost assured. As Jared points out, blacks and Hispanics are on average scholastic disasters. In the schools the gap in achievement is large between white and black, and has proven resistant to everything: {snip} If the shortfall doesn&rsquo;t change, it won&rsquo;t matter whether it is genetic or cultural in origin.</p>
<p>The implications, discussion of which is verboten, are not trivial. The US depends on and rewards deployable intelligence, particularly on IQs bordering on the scary, as in 180 and up. The clearest examples are in Silicon Valley, many of them from the physics department at Stanford or Harvard. These men  &mdash;  almost all are men  &mdash;  have given the US its dominance in technology. They are not just bright, like the valedictorian in your high school. They are off-scale, almost another species.</p>
<p>If you follow the computer/internet racket, you know that they are overwhelmingly white, Jewish (a subset of white, granted), Chinese, Asian Indian, Korean. The black and Hispanic proportion is close to zero if not actually zero. This isn&rsquo;t because of racial discrimination. {snip}.</p>
<p>Jared will disappoint many by not making exterminationist recommendations. But if you want a clear exposition of what is happening, he&rsquo;s worth a read.<br>

		<p>Jared Taylor covers a very serious topic and because he alert to the dos and don&rsquo;ts of the PC world he cannot appear as an alarmist&hellip; but&hellip;</p>
<p>In my estimation America is being set up for a very bloody Communist revolution.</p>
<p>The whites will be the bad kulaks and the non whites will be the good cadres struggling for class equality.</p>
<p>I have come to this conclusion after many years of working around sweat shops and living near the poor side of town.  The low whites and non whites are siding against the rich white people who play golf, have boats and stuff like that.</p>
<p>When America finishes its fall, the results will probably look like &hellip;. and the nice white people who love Jesus will no longer be collecting food for the poor.</p>

It occurred to me that this will be a great book to help White parents a generation or two in the future explain to their children why they have to live in bunkers and carry guns when they leave the fenced and heavily guarded enclave.</p>

<p>makes you believe in Karma.  Who helped finance the communist revolution in Russia?  Who handed Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and the Baltic states to the Communists on a silver platter? Your turn now.

		<p>Karma indeed.</p>
<p>Some of the answers lie in: The Naked Communist &<br>
The Naked Capitalist (W. Cleo Skousen).  Remember George Marshall&rsquo;s words &#8220;With the stroke of a pen, I disarm the nationalist Chinese army.&#8221;  Yes, the Americans destroyed the nationalist Chinese and willingly helped the Communists come into power.  That alone tells you there has been something screwy going on in Washington for a long, long time.</p>

<p>And so it is!</p>
<p>Oil does not mix with water, nor sand with orange juice!</p>
<p>Most here have accepted two issues as primary, for saving ourselves and our race. These are: All majority white countries must, at all costs, preserver and enlarge the white majorities they have; and, what happens to nonwhites, in those parts of the world they &ldquo;control&rdquo; is none of our business. This,  &ldquo;none of our business&rdquo; phrase meaning, we cannot save them and continue on a multicultural path as well. Moreover, we need not feel obligated to &ldquo;save them,&rdquo; as they are our enemies and openly crave our destruction, brazenly and endlessly!</p>
<p>So much for the, &ldquo;multicultural path!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or put another way, we must accept that freedom for nonwhites, means total economic and political separation from whites, period!</p>
<p>Until that day, they must be quarantined and forever removed from that which they hate, the West (that which they seek to infiltrate and destroy.) They must forever be reminded, that the West is and always will be greater than they are, or ever can be: You do not &ldquo;enrich it,&rdquo; you corrode it! You do not &ldquo;energize it,&rdquo; you  make an endless coma of civilization, or even what it means to be human!</p>
<p>Enough said, other than and of course, God Help Us All!!!!</p>

The implications, discussion of which is verboten, are not trivial.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>The biggest one of which is that if you do nothing but &#8216;allow differences to continue&rsquo; the unequal population blooms will leave you awash in a sea of human locusts with an elite that cannot be ingenious enough to innovate a solution to Malthusian conditions which lead to millions-on-millions meltdowns.</p>
<p>When the food can&rsquo;t be distributed.  When no electricity means no lights.  Or refrigeration.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The US depends on and rewards deployable intelligence, particularly on IQs bordering on the scary, as in 180 and up.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Someone should do a study.  When (and in what groups) specifically &#8216;scary&rsquo; IQs started developing.  If blacks can go from 67 to 87 in 300 years, what about 100+ IQs that have been getting the best Flynn Effect advantage from the time whites were hunter gatherers, 15-20,000 years ago.</p>
<p>IMO, it is beyond likely that those we consider Elites are in fact not &#8216;thinking&rsquo; on our level at all.  We may be writeoffs for reasons that we don&rsquo;t even see.  Because we are no longer operating on the same species-level.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The clearest examples are in Silicon Valley, many of them from the physics department at Stanford or Harvard. These men &mdash; almost all are men &mdash; have given the US its dominance in technology. They are not just bright, like the valedictorian in your high school. They are off-scale, almost another species.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Einstein could barely tie his shoes.  Didn&rsquo;t think of atomic weapons until after the idea was presented by &#8216;lesser beings&rsquo; and was notoriously, libidenously, unfaithful.  High IQ brings penalties that are hard to accomodate, socially, in ways that benefit the group as a whole.</p>
<p>The group in turn can exceed the superior mind, simply by acting together.</p>
<p>The ones you have to be careful of are those who have enough experience of having their agendas squashed by the masses that they switch tactics to getting the masses to &#8216;believe&rsquo; what will, directly or by fallout consequence, achieve their goals anyway.</p>
<p>This is the truth behind globalism, universalism, the takeover of the media and academia and the rolling-pebble-becomes-avalanche impetus to worship the most vile of our culture.  Because they -seem- to expound our views.</p>
<p>Michael King becomes Jesse Jackson becomes Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>The progression is denigrative and accelerative until the inability to believe in moral truths equates to a forced belief in &#8216;individualist&rsquo; _amorality_ which denies any hope of collective action by sensible, isolated, common folk.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
If you follow the computer/internet racket, you know that they are overwhelmingly white, Jewish (a subset of white, granted), Chinese, Asian Indian, Korean. The black and Hispanic proportion is close to zero if not actually zero. This isn&rsquo;t because of racial discrimination. {snip}.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Evolution favors those who are driven by randomness of threat and advantage in a highly dangerous environment to succeed or starve as hunter gatherers.  Women didn&rsquo;t face that constant pursuit-as-selective Darwinism.  Hence they have a 4 point deficit of performance in key areas of spatial/math ability to align concepts and explore options (they have overall a more even distribution of intelligence however so their norm is better than many males).</p>
<p>The problem here of course is that nobody sees the Z factor of TIME as horizoning.</p>
<p>It took us millennia of high protein hunter rewards to develop the white mental faculties as genetic maximums which gave us some really brilliant 135-160 IQs in an era (1200-1700) when normal cognitive function was probably no better in Europe than it was in other primitive societies.</p>
<p>We could lose that supreme gift, in the span of a century, due to the deliberate ignorement of Darwinian meritocracy as a muddying of genelines.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Jared will disappoint many by not making exterminationist recommendations. But if you want a clear exposition of what is happening, he&rsquo;s worth a read.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because, we are still a dominant cultural demographic.  It&rsquo;s not until you are a minority and any million-on-million war of annihilation between R and K breeding racial subgroups can truly destroy us that we will become cognizant of any mortal limitations as vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Here, you are also looking at the differential between pulling back into segregated communities which are isolated and alone.  Vs. remaining a cultural continuum of at least state level enclaves with access to survivable populations and useful resources.</p>
<p>And that IS something we need to consider.  Because Jared&rsquo;s idea of reinstituting the 1950s levels of racial segregation will ONLY work when there are enough whites to execute the policy whether our dependent cultures will it or nil it.</p>
<p>It is an indication of their terror at this separation and hence the lengths to which they would go, that this action is not seen by blacks and hispanics as being equally amenable.</p>
<p>That is their secret conceit.  They need us.  Our history in the hell of Ice Age Europe and beyond shows that we were better off when we did _not_ have knowledge or association with ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>And no one will doubt this, because the obvious counter to any &#8216;we need each other&rsquo; argument is: &#8220;You&rsquo;re telling me that you accept slavery for the chance to asphyxiate us in a death hug of dependence?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of this review.  To make it succinct, it reads something like this:</p>
<p><i>Jared Taylor is not a K-person who believes in slavery and genocide, unlike all those other white nationalists and/or racial realists.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the premise that WN/RR is the province of mindless retrogrades and that JT is the rare human exception.  That&rsquo;s a construct of the media and certain poverty and defamation groups.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I received a book I ordered from the US Naval Institute Press - about this very subject.</p>
<p>The title: The Dragon&rsquo;s War / Allied Operations and the Fate of China 1937-1947    by Maochun Yu.</p>
<p>It was on sale for eight or nine dollars.  The inner leaf reads (first para):</p>
<p>Making full use of significant new sources in Chinese-language materials, U.S. Naval Academy professor Maochun Yu provides Western readers with the first detailed account of military and intelligence operations conducted inside China by foreign powers between 1937 and 1947.  He also addresses the profound impact of these operations upon China&rsquo;s nationalism, wartime politics, and overall military campaigns.  Arguing that operations by the USSR, the United States, Britain and France, in particular, challenged the authority and legitimacy of the Chinese nationalist government, he illustrates how the failure of the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-shek to control these operations contributed to its demise following world War II.</p>
<p>I am sure this is not the only book dealing with this subject.  There is another book I read while in Viet Nam 45 years ago that I am intending to get.  I haven&rsquo;t found but three copies on Abebooks, so after I have mine, I will let you know the title:}.</p>
<p>Also listed on the back inside is another USNI title styled: &#8220;Soldier Slaves:  Abandoned by the White House, Courts and Congress&#8221; by James W. Parkinson.  That is probably the GI&rsquo;s left behind in SEA.  But don&rsquo;t know for sure. Check out the USNI website.</p>

<p>Please tell me you are being sarcastic. I don&rsquo;t know South America but worked and lived in various countries in Asia for almost 10 years. One of them in particular comes to mind, Malaysia. The three ethnic groups, Malays, Indians and Chinese hate each other. It takes a strong police force to keep them from killing each other.<br>

		<p>Commenter #7- thank you for bring globalism into this. Also #15; thanks. I&rsquo;ve been saying for the last ten years (around the time I got sober&hellip; Coincidence?that globalization is nothing but &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; for the elite corporate extremists. This has been due, in part, to many people on the moderate right &amp; center blaming the Democrats for all that ails us. All the while the right and Wall Street Repubs sold us to China, India, Mexico and many other third World societies they could hit with a dart on an Atlas. My Dad has family in Slovakia, a very poor nation in Eastern Europe. Those people would work if given the opportunity. But guess what? It&rsquo;s a White nation of mainly Slavic origin, so they are ignored like many other White enclaves. In a sense the Marxists know that w/o interference the Whites can take care of themselves. But subconsciously, they realize that Africa, parts of Islamic Asia, and large portions of S. America will never be able to do it w/o the &#8220;Industrialized&#8221; (see White or Asian) world to help out. Hypocrites.</p>

		<p>Does anyone see the irony of all this? The American Indian lived here in peace(except occaisional disputes with another tribe)until the White man came and destroyed their world and put them on reservations. Now, the same thing the White man did to the Indians,is happening to them. It won&rsquo;t be long before the minority is the majority and the White&rsquo;s will be put to death or put on a reservation. Kind of ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I lived a couple of decades in Washington, DC, a city mostly black, and had many white liberal friends. They believed they believed in multiculturalism, but they &mdash; we &mdash; lived in an overwhelmingly white world: white restaurants, friends, bars, clubs, dances. I can&rsquo;t remember even once being in an establishment in which the majority, or anything close to it, were black. Whites associate with whites, blacks with blacks. That&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Maybe in Washington. I live out in the boonies.  I mean, really out in the sticks where you would only expect racist rednecks. </p>
<p>Down our not even black topped country road lives a family, I stopped by and met the son&rsquo;s girlfriend. She is black.  One of the young women in the country church we go to has a half black kid.  One of the older women had a black kid along and introduced it as her grandchild.  A welfare white trash type used to come with four children, three of them were black.  Yesterday I talked to an older lady whose 17 year old granddaughter had some problem with another student.She has to appear in court.  I said, if she were black she would not have a thing to worry about. Well, I put my foot in there, the kid IS  black.  This is in a radius of a couple of miles around me. <br>
The nice elderly gentleman down the road has a new girlfriend, she is black. And the live in girlfriend, almost daughter in law  of a friend of mine who really lives out in the sticks is really black.  I figure if this is how it is around here, will it be different anywhere else?  The little countryschool with not a black child in it from miles around, hired a black teacher.  Must have been a while since Fred lived in Washington. </p>

		<p>Of course &#8216;Diversity is our strength&rsquo; is a stupid myth propagated by stupid liberals. The happiest people on earth are those who lack racial diversity. The most peacful communities are those with fewest blacks. When my community became diversified (i.e.less white), property values fell 50%. Now we have the following benefits: crime, vandalism, littering, illegal dumping and noise. Even a lousy $10 garden hose left out overnight was stolen. Reality contradicts just about all liberal myths.</p>

The American Indian lived here in peace</p>

<p>nothing against them, I wish everybody well.  They were as peaceful amongst themselves as the tribes in Africa. How peaceful they were shows how they sided with different factions of the &#8216;invaders&rsquo; instead of uniting against them. </p>
<p>One of Anerica&rsquo;s biggest problems is, they believe in historic fairytales. And don&rsquo;t try to tell them different.<br>

<p>The mass graves that predate the arrival of the Europeans suggest otherwise, that they were just as violent as Europeans were, if not more so.</p>

<p>To Anonymous 17. You miss the point. What you say is not the irony. The American Indian was beaten fair and square in brutal wars and THEN put on reservations. The white man is committing suicide by allowing people he can BEAT easily to put him on reservations without firing a shot simply using words like racism,bigotry etc. THAT is the irony.</p>

		<p>@21  I wrote #17. This certainly was not meant to be an&#8221;in your face.&#8221; I apologize if it seemed that way. I&rsquo;m a White male in my fifties and have seen this once great country go down so quickly in the last 15 or 20 years that it scares me. The analogy wasn&rsquo;t about Indian culture but a way of looking at what are ancestors did by running out the Indians, and now it seems that we are being run out.The race that made this country and the soldiers who fought for this country are no longer important. Citizenship was something to be proud of, and now our president wants to give it away and to people who do not care about our country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;makes you believe in Karma. Who helped finance the communist revolution in Russia? Who handed Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and the Baltic states to the Communists on a silver platter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Churchill was equally guilty in that.</p>

		<p>I admire the American Indians.  They fought back as best they could.  They did not cave in like Whites do now.</p>
<p>One thought about the hispanic invasion.  Looking at labor statistics, most of the jobs presently and in the future are security guards, cleaners, gardeners, nurses aides and food workers.  These are all low IQ jobs.  The people who do best in these jobs have little ambition and are content with welfare level wages.</p>
<p>There was an article in the WSJ today.  The average starting salary for new BA graduates this year is $27,000, only $7,000 more than a security guard with no high school diploma.</p>
<p>From about 1400 to 1970 the great need was for intelligent innovative workers at whatever level.  Now the need is for low level workers who don&rsquo;t need to think.  Occasionally I read a woman&rsquo;s magazine with its idiotic &#8220;How to advance in your job&#8221; articles.  Most of these articles advise the reader to be innovative, make suggestions and make improvements.  It is so obvious that the writers have never actually worked in the real world.  In the real world, employees are expected to be robotic drones.</p>
<p>That is what employers want.  That is what employers are importing from Mexico, S America and Asia.  As far as the science and technology men go, the Whites invent, the asians copy.  </p>
<p>We are competing with China, Korea and Japan.  Since the Asians don&rsquo;t invent, only copy, we don&rsquo;t need to invent to compete with them.</p>

		<p>The communists won&rsquo;t put us on reservations. They would be afraid of keeping us together for fear we would re conquer the land.  Also, they truly hate us, like the Nazis hated the Jews.</p>
<p>They need to eliminate us because unlike the Indians, they can never be sure we will stay on our reservations.</p>
<p>Of course George Soros &amp; co are probably stockpiling the sperm and eggs of tall, thin beautiful blonds with the object of creating Blade Runner type sex toys.</p>
