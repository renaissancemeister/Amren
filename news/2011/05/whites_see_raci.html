	<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>Although some have heralded recent political and cultural developments as signaling the arrival of a postracial era in America, several legal and social controversies regarding &#8220;reverse racism&#8221; highlight Whites&rsquo; increasing concern about anti-White bias. We show that this emerging belief reflects Whites&rsquo; view of racism as a zero-sum game, such that decreases in perceived bias against Blacks over the past six decades are associated with increases in perceived bias against Whites  &mdash;  a relationship not observed in Blacks&rsquo; perceptions. Moreover, these changes in Whites&rsquo; conceptions of racism are extreme enough that Whites have now come to view anti-White bias as a bigger societal problem than anti-Black bias.</p>

		<p>The theme of this article is true.</p>
<p>I deal with Puerto Ricans periodically.  They bristle and are quick to correct you if you assume they are Mexican, as most people do in my neck of the woods.  They don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans come in many racial variations; Mexicans, for the most part, do not.  They are ninety percent Mestizo, tending to be short, squat, dark haired, and brown skinned.</p>
<p>One young Puerto Rican I talked to recently said to me, regarding Mexicans, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like the way they look.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Good news indeed if true. Now if we can only get the Academics to see it. I mean it&rsquo;s not like Blacks are creating their own companies or towns. They are taking over private and public jobs previously held by Whites. How is this not a zero sum game? </p>

<p>Today I heard about LOOTING in N. Minneapolis after the tornado there.</p>
<p>I found a tiny article about it around 2:00 PM  CSDST</p>
<p>I wanted to read it again and it was gone at 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Does this seem kind of strange to you too?<br>
I bet it was those pesky (white) looter again?<br>
Whites just can&rsquo;t seem to miss an opportunity to steal?</p>

		<p> Leave it to two Eastern professors   &mdash;   one from Hahvahd, naturally   &mdash;   to express astonishment that Whites believe government-mandated preferences for blacks mean a &#8220;zero-sum game,&#8221; taking jobs, seats in university classrooms, etc., away from Whites. Of course that&rsquo;s exactly what they mean. And of course, blacks are unlikely to see it that way, because they&rsquo;re the ones who are benefiting, at our expense. If you rob Peter to pay Paul, you&rsquo;ll get Paul&rsquo;s vote   &mdash;   but not Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p> And if anti-White bias had not become a big societal problem   &mdash;   bigger now than any alleged anti-black bias   &mdash;   then there wouldn&rsquo;t be all this bad feeling about affirmative action and the like, among Whites; and all of these legal challenges to racial preferences for blacks wouldn&rsquo;t have been filed.</p>
<p> If these two top-lofty sachems from the Groves of Academe believe that this is a uniquely American problem, and that White Americans are uniquely, and unjustifiably, upset about it, they should read the history of Malaysia since it became independent to see how &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; has caused many more problems than it&rsquo;s solved in that Southeast Asian country.</p>

Oh No I can&rsquo;t believe I said that.. Am I a RACIST because I did?</p>
<p>N. MINNEAPOLIS (TORNADO AFTERMATH 5/23/11</p>
<p>Soon after a tornado ripped through North Minneapolis pm Sunday afternoon, an estimated 20 looters ripped off Broadway Liquor Outlet. </p>
<p>The high winds that downed trees and tore off roofs in the area also smashed the glass storefront of the liquor store at 2201 W. Broadway Ave., which was closed. </p>
<p>The looters stole liquor, cigarettes and cash, said owner Dean Rose. The store had plywood boards nailed to its exterior by 7:30 p.m., but broken glass and cases of beer could be seen scattered on the floor inside. Rose said Sunday night he didn&rsquo;t know the extent of the theft. </p>
<p>Minneapolis Police on Sunday night could not confirm reports of looting. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s devastating,&#8221; said Rose, the third generation of his family to run the store. &#8220;It puts us out of business.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s an unfortunate disaster,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The whole community has been hit hard.&#8221; </p>
<p>Asia Harris, 26, of Minneapolis said she saw the looters as the storm struck. Debris hit the Honda Accord she was driving, but she took notice of the thefts. </p>
<p>&#8220;Once it hit, they (?) started taking things out,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>I think this belated enlightenment has a lot to do with Whites seeing more and more first hand, how Blacks handle power where they have achieved it.  It&rsquo;s beginning to sink in that Blacks want fairness when they&rsquo;re in the minority and revenge when they&rsquo;re not.  Back in the 50s/60s integration was just a noble theory.  Now most Whites are seeing exactly how this integration stuff works in the real world and they don&rsquo;t much like it and they don&rsquo;t have a clue how to deal with it.</p>

		<p>What did they expect, that ever elusive perfect world where we all love each other and live forever?  You see, it was never about racism, it was all about power, prestige, and money.  The tides turned a while ago and whites are just seeing it now.  Too late!  Go ahead, try and stop it with your ever decreasing power, prestige, and dwindling demographic numbers.</p>
<p>Redistribution of wealth is the end game and it has already started.  The saddest part is that many whites agreed to it, they just didn&rsquo;t know it.  Like I&rsquo;ve said before, our own people are our biggest problem and until we tackle our biggest problem, the bottom will draw nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>And, if whites think a solution lies with either of the major political parties, they&rsquo;ll be sealing their doom.<br>

		<p>This is great! WNs should talk openly about anti-White racism and instead of rejecting multiculturalism outright or stating the dangers of miscegenation overtly, talk instead of how multiculturalism really means different groups living together &amp; keeping their distinctiveness rather than mixing &amp; merging into a cultureless raceless mass. Then later upon such sentiment becoming common, can we talk openly about segregation &amp; IQ. Good luck!</p>

<p>As always, let us translate this multicultural doublespeak into real and easily understood English!</p>
<p>Moreover, these changes in Whites&rsquo; conceptions of multiculturalism are extreme enough that Whites have now come to view the genocidal prerogatives of their ruling class, as a bigger societal problem, than allowing that ruling class to &ldquo;appease&rdquo; their nonwhite aggressors as a viable function of &ldquo;politics as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, they may have awakened to a treason so shameless and monstrous, that nationalistic social and Eurocentric cultural revolution is no longer a possibility in the USA, but an inevitability!</p>

		<p>Notice the phrase &#8220;perceived&#8221; bias against whites. It is not perceived. It just is. Main stream media is doing all they can to hide the ethnicity of people committing crimes who are black, but not hispanic or white. In my newspaper, no picture is given with the article when the perpatrator(s)are black. And it&rsquo;s really a joke when a crime has occurred and the BOLO (be on the lookout) description given to the public does not include the race, unless white or hispanic. The race of a subject is a decriptor only. Everyone comes in different colors - so do white people. These dolts would rather compromise the safety of everyone for the sake of being what they believe is politically correct - it is not PC to completely abdicate common sense, it&rsquo;s insanity. And there is non reporting and stonewalling by the media if it is a particularly heinous black on white crime. And don&rsquo;t get me started on Affirmative Action Quotas or most of the garbage coming out of Hollywood.</p>
<p>But I have noticed a growing awakening and resentment to these and other anti-White bias incidents that the MSM is having a hard time containing. And articles like this are further proof - anti-White bias is being seen and recognized for what it is, a slow marginalizing of the White race. Let the dolts try and trivialize it by calling it &#8220;perceived&#8221; all they want. We know it&rsquo;s a reality.</p>
<p>It takes a very childish mentality to call racism a &#8220;game&#8221;. We are far from a postracial era when ANY race is targeted for potential genocide. THAT is a very dangerous game to play, where there will be no &#8220;winners&#8221; or &#8220;losers&#8221;. Just losers. </p>

		<p>Maybe some liberal white voters are now feeling the pain? It&rsquo;s about time they wake up and stand up for for their own interests.<br>
I think part of the reason is that a lot of non-traditional groups like Asians, Indians and visa holders are affecting their prospects for medical, technical and teaching opportunities. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, Blacks and Hispanics really get the lion&rsquo;s share of the government jobs. </p>
<p>This all facts affect many traditional liberal families as well. </p>
<p>Love to hear some liberal&rsquo;s son/daughter complaining to dad/mom how he/she was kicked to the end of the opportunity line to placate some minority. <br>

		<p>Of COURSE it&rsquo;s a &#8220;zero-sum game!&#8221; When two groups have mutually exclusive desires, one will win and the other will lose. It&rsquo;s common sense. </p>
<p>Whites want to live among themselves in mostly-white communities, places with reasonably low crime rates, nice parks, museums and theaters, clean streets, etc. </p>
<p>Blacks want the nice amenities that whites create, but that they are unable to create or maintain themselves. This obviously leads to conflict and displacement, Detroit being the classic example. </p>
<p>Add to this the fact that the various racial groups&rsquo; voting patterns differ quite markedly from each other, the mess of Affirmative Action, the racial grievance industry, differing crime rates and intelligence levels among the races, etc. etc. etc and it could be nothing else but a &#8220;zero-sum game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although these findings certainly come belatedly (credit it to the human tendency for wishful thinking and self-delusion, perhaps these are the first glimmerings of a reawakening of white consciousness. Let us hope so.</p>

		<p>I work for a transportation co. and get to talk to alot of different people evey day. I usually have Rush, Hannity, Bork, Beck ( I know, not IDEAL conservatives! ) on the radio and use their comments to start conversations. If they&rsquo;re talking about Obama ( which is always ), I&rsquo;ll usually say &#8220;I can&rsquo;t believe he went to that racist black church for 20yrs. and claims he doesn&rsquo;t believe what &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright preaches, who in their right mind would go to a church for TWENTY YEARS and not believe what his Rev. was preaching?&#8221; To the majority of my passengers it seems to open up the floodgates ( like they were waiting for someone else make the first move ) and they&rsquo;ll talk VERY openly about race that it would make Amren blush. The others need alittle more &#8220;prodding&#8221; - which I gleefully provide! But it does seem Whites are waking up.  </p>

		<p># 13 wrote &#8220;And don&rsquo;t get me started on Affirmative Action Quotas&#8221;</p>
<p>What quotas?  There are numerous, actually most government agencies that have no White quota at all.  The White quota was eliminated back in 1968.   No government Whites have been hired since then.  Now that all the pre 1968 Whites have retired, government is as much a no Whites need apply  zone as was English government work from 1535 to 1832 when it was illegal to even be a Catholic in England.</p>
<p>I well remember a meeting held at my government agency back in 1973 to orient us to a promotional exam coming up.  Someone asked what about the affirmative action quotas?  The speaker said no problem, we ran the numbers and found that the 1970 census showed blacks 6 percent of the population.  The positions for which the exam is being given are 18 percent black.  So there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Wrong!!!!!!!</p>
<p>No Whites were promoted from that exam.  </p>
<p>No Whites were hired at any level after 1973.  Within a year the Whites were abused and harassed by not just black employees but numerous marxist radicals foisted on us by the federal government in the name of the Johnson Nixon war on poverty, LEAP, CETA, EEOA and the rest of Nixon&rsquo;s anti White moves.  </p>
<p>The White radical marxists didn&rsquo;t actually work for the county agency.  They were given office space paid for by the feds and along with the blacks went on search and destroy missions against the White county employees.  At the same time the feminazis among them were crusading against rape, the same feminazis and their radical men cohorts were trying to get every White woman fired because we turned down the sexual approaches of the black men the EEOC dumped on us.</p>
<p>Whenever liberals talk about the justice of the quota system I ask them how many Whites work at our local Post Office, ITS,Library, DMV, community center, clean the parks, drive buses drive police cars, etc.</p>
<p>Even the most bigoted liberal has to concede the point.  But of course then I get &#8220;Well, Whites are so rich and privileged they wouldn&rsquo;t want to have some boring clerical job with the DMV, IRS or walk around in summer heat and winter snow to deliver the mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>It cracks me up to know that those White liberals often have 27 year old children living at home because they can&rsquo;t find jobs. And they will never admit that their kids did not get admitted to the college of their choice because they are White.</p>

		<p>I disagree with #6. I think the internet is the main factor in white men becoming aware of their situation. Personal observation is definitely a factor*, but the internet bypasses the MSM. White men can now mass communicate directly, with relevant and uncensored information and commentary.  </p>
<p><br>
*The internet makes personal observation even more important, because personal observations can now be communicated to a massive audience. </p>

 I suspect that this sentiment was a factor in the<br>
Congrssional election of last November. Not only<br>
did Democrats lose the white male vote by a margin<br>
of 2-1, but they lost the white female vote by the<br>
landslide majority of 3-2!</p>

		<p>I have to say this may be the SINGLE positive piece of news I ever saw on Am Ren.</p>
<p>And please read folks, because if you haven&rsquo;t had a turning point moment like this, you will, one day.<br>
Today, driving home, in the last three blocks before I reached my house, I took notice of the faces of all I saw. <br>
I saw nine people. <br>
Eight were Latin American, or black. All were very recent arrivals. <br>
Out of nine people, ONE was white. twenty years ago in this area, you&rsquo;d have been unfortunate if you saw ONE third worlder in nine.</p>
<p>I realized, as I sat in my driveway&hellip;&#8221;It&rsquo;s time to get out&hellip;AGAIN.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a refugee of Miami (it was once a great American town). My parents spirited the family away, up to Central Florida when I was about five. Bless them for that. It bought us a beautiful upbringing. <br>
I moved to Colorado as a very young man, never guessing that all of Florida, including my beloved beachside town would one day be a foreign country.</p>
<p>Now my adopted home of Colorado- truly a jewel, and God&rsquo;s country, is becoming the third world at an unbelievable pace. And I don&rsquo;t live in Denver. That rat&rsquo;s nest is just like Los Angeles was 20 years ago. Truly a slimehole. <br>
Now the medium-sized towns of Colorado are so &#8220;diverse&#8221;, it&rsquo;s just heartbreaking. </p>
<p>All one can do is move into the mountains, where third worlders would rarely go. But as soon as a wal- mart plunks down, and some apartments are built- say goodbye to America there, too.  They&rsquo;ll relocate African &#8220;refugees&#8221; out in the middle of nowhere&hellip;nothing would surprise me now.<br>
What to do?<br>
I&rsquo;m bewildered.</p>

<p>Anti-White Bias a Problem?<br>
A new study says whites think discrimination against them is a bigger problem than anti-black bias. Is this surprising?<br>
When Prejudice Is So Malleable<br>
Updated May 23, 2011, 12:10 PM</p>
<p>Patricia J. Williams is the James L. Dohr Professor of Law at Columbia University. She writes the column &#8220;Diary of a Mad Law Professor,&#8221; which appears monthly in The Nation.</p>
<p>The finding that white Americans see blacks&rsquo; progress as an insult or a diminishment of their status is not entirely surprising. Zero-sum formulations of prejudice tend to emerge in lean economic times, fueling cultural or historical rivalries of all sorts. </p>
<p>As blacks have made greater symbolic strides, pity has turned into resentment and projected fear. I have a hunch that if the study had included questions about whether whites feel threatened by &ldquo;reverse racism&rdquo; among Asians, Latinos and immigrants, the results would be much the same. Those perceptions notwithstanding, data show that white Americans remain the most privileged human beings on the planet. </p>
<p>The world is changing, however, and the realignment of wealth, power, jobs and resources has been deeply challenging to the notion of American exceptionalism. That exceptionalism, consciously or unconsciously, is infused with racialized hierarchies   &mdash;   normative whiteness and masculinity still marking the &ldquo;worthiest&rdquo; inheritors of the American dream. </p>
<p>Moreover, the downturn in all our fortunes has been relentlessly and poisonously exploited by certain segments of the media. The language of &ldquo;us&rdquo; versus &ldquo;them&rdquo; dominates far too much of our radio and television discourse. The litany of scapegoats who are supposedly fouling &ldquo;our&rdquo; trough includes not just blacks but those of Mexican, Japanese, Korean or Hawaiian descent, non-born-again Christians, the entire People&rsquo;s Republic of China, Canadians, the French, liberal elites and the elderly. </p>
<p>The trickiest thing about prejudice is that it is so malleable, so capable of reinvention. Susan Fiske, a professor of psychology at Princeton, has documented the varied and fluctuating presentations of social biases like race, class, disability, gender. She points out that there are nuanced differences in how prejudice is expressed against the disabled as opposed to Asian-Americans, or as against high-status blacks versus poor blacks, or the homeless or those with low-status accents. Elements like pity, resentment, competition, revulsion, paternalism, or fear play against one another in complicated ways.</p>
<p>Fiske employs a grid to predict how social groups will be ranked, using attributed vectors of warmth/coldness and competence/incompetence. In the simplest terms, her metric is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Those stereotyped as high competence and high warmth are met with pride and admiration (like most white people). <br>
2. Groups who rank as high warmth and low competence are treated with pity, sympathy, paternalism (like the elderly). <br>
3. Those stereotyped as high competence and low warmth are met with envy (like Jews and Asians). <br>
4. Those perceived as low competence and low warmth are greeted with contempt, anger and resentment (like the homeless). </p>
<p>Through much of American history, blacks have been viewed as low on the competence index (negative feelings), but warm enough to be pitied (which is usually felt not as a negative but a protective, &ldquo;pro-black&rdquo; fuzzy emotion). As blacks have made greater symbolic strides in the last few decades, that ranking seems to have shifted: there is envy, suspicion, resentment  &mdash;  despite numbers, despite empirical documentation to the contrary  &mdash;  that blacks are &ldquo;taking over&rdquo; as the recipients not of due process but of undue &ldquo;favoritism.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This projected fear is a danger to the nation. For all the gains of the civil rights movement, blacks remain among the poorest, most segregated and most unemployed of all Americans. There can be no commonweal when such grim reality is invisible to white fellow citizens who are driven instead by fantasies of competitive victimhood. A house divided cannot stand.<br>

		<p>Anonymous # 20 brings up the usual list of black problems.  Here&rsquo;s the thing, none of those are the result of &#8220;white racism.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s not whites fault that blacks cannot compete in an advanced society like the US.  Their problems are the same no matter where they are.  Here, Europe, South America. Bringing the entire country down to their level, hence the &#8220;equality of outcome&#8221; that the elites now push for is no solution unless you seek the destruction of our society.  Whites cannot save blacks from themselves and we&rsquo;d better stop trying.</p>

		<p>Yes anti-white discrimination exits. It&rsquo;s real. The way the law and societal rules work it, is alright to discriminate against whites, especially white males. As AA programs take more and more away from whites they will have to fight back. The best way to start is over jobs. Sue the b**tards. Don&rsquo;t except their premise that asking to be judge on individual merit is racist. Remember almost all of these race hustlers are Marxist at their core. Don&rsquo;t except the premise that black dysfunctionally is the fault of whites. Say so, politely, but say it. Go on saying it. Your grandchildren will thank you.</p>

		<p><i>  You see, it was never about racism, it was all about power, prestige, and money. The tides turned a while ago and whites are just seeing it now. Too late! Go ahead, try and stop it with your ever decreasing power, prestige, and dwindling demographic numbers.<br>
</i></p>
<p>Interesting point. The civil rights movement posed as being about equality, but it gave power  to a new class of social managers, bureaucrats and race hustlers. In one sense, race was just the excuse. The old order was displaced, along with Whites who today lack the organization to fight for their rights. </p>
<p>For that matter, your average black really is not seeing much in the way of power these days (given the numbers in jail or dropping out of school). But it is the Sharptons, the diversity educators, the Kennedy clan, and others who can make a living out of claiming the mantle of the fight for racial equality. <br>
 <br>
This is why is it nonsensical to talk about a post-racial America. Race has to be kept alive by the race hustlers in order to maintain their power and keep the cash flowing. </p>

		<p>when I came to this country I had the usual &#8220;blue eyed&#8221; meaning naive, attitude towards blacks.  Here is this nice, honest, taken advantage of black guy  by the river side fishing, singing gospel songs, and the white sneaking up, hitting him over the head. <br>
Later I read a few things by MLK, (Martin Luther would turn in his grave) and there was one thing that  made all the difference to me. He lamented that on a trip, I forgot from where, Selma probably, he had to sleep in the car because he was not allowed in any of the white motels. I read that again, and not being from this country, I said:&#8221; why didn&rsquo;t he stay in a black motel&#8221;?  Nobody thought of starting one along the road?  What were they thinking? Don&rsquo;t tell me whites kept them from putting up even a shack by the road and making a bit of cash by renting rooms. But whining about not getting to use the white drinking fountain. Did a white get to use the colored drinking fountain?  <br>
I doubt that whites will &#8220;wake up&#8221;.  They have been too brainwashed, especially the women. Your women will be your downfall. I agree with Fred Reed on American women. <br>
The white man, hardworking, innovative,generous, has taken so much crap and let it turn him wimpier and wimpier. It started with the women, the children, and now the blacks and sundry minorities. He is becoming afraid of his own shadow. Yea,join the military and go to foreign lands and shoot the locals. Then come home and be a wimp. <br>
Excuse the rant.  </p>

		<p> &#8220;I think the internet is the main factor in white men becoming aware of their situation. Personal observation is definitely a factor*, but the internet bypasses the MSM. White men can now mass communicate directly, with relevant and uncensored information and commentary&#8221;</p>
<p>This is absolutely the truth- the fact that so much raw information is available in real time on the web is a game changer- more and more it&rsquo;s obvious the amount of anti-white bias that exists, not only in non-white countries, but also in the liberal, left wing, politically correct media in predominantly white societies. . Thanks to the Internet, pulling the wool over peoples eyes is less and less easy- the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; being a perfect example. My own realization that something was wrong was a direct result of the Internet. I am proud of being white- (and rightly so, my race has given birth to the modern world), and feel no need to put anyone else down because they aren&rsquo;t. This cuts both ways, however. </p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen you post for a long time.  If you are the same Margaret, that is.  But welcome back.  I have always enjoyed your posts.</p>
<p>All of these people, including the researchers providing the stats and interpretations you listed, have a problem with whites as the accepted host, majority population as an automatic determiner of privilege.  If a nation is established and remains over 90% white for say, 200 years, it is natural that whites would have the advantage.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to be seen as something inherently unfair, unless one applies Marxist theory that is wielded by those who want to take the place of those whites.  The remnant of the white dominated American culture that still remains in position is being attacked for their rightful heritage and the sons and daughters of revolutionaries and pioneers, people who bleed the ground red to bring us into the modern age.  Yet these descendants are constantly vilified and prodded relentlessly to forget their own history and value to the nation.  Indeed, the house is crumbling.</p>

		<p>All societies are run by elites. <br>
Most of the brilliant marxist revolutionaries like Herbert Marcuse simply understood that the plebs(meant in jest) were never going to &#8216;rise up&rsquo; because they didn&rsquo;t have the capacity, the mental capacity, to lead. The overwhelming number of people of all creeds and races are followers. They do what they are told, even if it&rsquo;s against their instincts.</p>
<p>In the end, the failure was not the common man&rsquo;s, but by our elites. They saw the writing on the wall and failed us, cowered and fell. Equal rights irregardless if you were a woman or a black man, was never the issue. But it quickly went beyond equal rights, especially if you look at the 1965 immigration act(and those who were the principal backers behind it).</p>
<p>Those are the culprits, and those of us who failed to stop it or even encouraged it(like the Kennedys).</p>
<p>By the time people get it in full, we&rsquo;ll have a South Africa situation, by time it&rsquo;ll be too late. In fact, it is already. </p>
<p>The only thing that can restore our majority now are unspeakable things. And those would come not by command but by surprise, like a full(or perhaps even partial) collapse of the nation&rsquo;s economy, and hence, the full effect of anarchy and race war busting open for all to see.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we&rsquo;ll make ends meet and we&rsquo;ll limper on, but our fall from grace was spectacular. In the end, however, remember that were attacked from within, and nullified a response. Our weakness was extraordinary and our humiliation complete. Whatever happens in the future, even if it&rsquo;s bad, it will never be as bad as this.</p>
<p>We may be reduced in 20 years from now, but we will be free.</p>
<p>Never again.</p>

		<p>What is news about this? It&rsquo;s a zero-sum game because of scarce resources that enable you to move up the economic ladder. A seat in a restaurant is not the same as a seat in a classroom of a top university. If there are no seats in the restaurant you choose, it&rsquo;s a simple matter of going to the next one down the block. Getting into a university is a six-month process, and you have to apply to at least three to have a chance at one acceptance. If you don&rsquo;t get accepted, you&rsquo;re SOL.</p>
<p>If a minority with lower scores got a seat and you didn&rsquo;t with higher scores, there is only one seat &hellip; zero sum.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Forwarded Message  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>From a chain email:</p>
<p>Russell K. Nieli recently brought to light a new study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and his colleague Alexandria Radford that shows that lower-income European Americans (poor whites) are the most discriminated against group of people in college admissions.</p>
<p>Nieli writes:  &#8220;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely. These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get that?  Not African Americans, not Mestizo Americans   &mdash;  - but European Americans are the most discriminated against group in college admissions.</p>
<p>This widespread discrimination against European Americans should be unsurprising. And immigration is making it worse, as more non-whites immigrate here their &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; status makes them prime affirmative action candidates.</p>
<p>All other racial groups have powers lobbying on their behalf. Blacks have the NAACP, mestizos have La Raza, Asians have the 80-20 Initiative, Indians have USINPAC, etc. What do European Americans have?</p>
<p>When other groups lobby on behalf of their ethnic interests and whites do nothing, whites are bound to receive the short end of the stick.  And all the while this is taking place, many whites pursue the &ldquo;ostrich strategy&rdquo;. They stick their heads in the sand and wish it were otherwise.</p>
<p>Time to take your heads out of the sand, white people.</p>

<p>This reminds me of Napoleon&rsquo;s words to one of his generals at Waterloo; &#8220;Pursue them, keep them dispersed, and never, never, allow them to regroup, NEVER!&#8221;  Of course, his general failed him and allowed the Prussians to regroup and rejoin the battle, giving Wellington the victory and setting France on a losing streak that hasn&rsquo;t ended to this day.  In fact, that trend allowed Marxism an early foothold in Paris and the rise of the infamous Left Bank, which later infected the U.S. through its Ivy League obsession with Left Bank Political Chic.</p>

		<p>I HAVE BEEN A VICTIM of anti-white racism.  So I know what I&rsquo;m talking about.  </p>
<p>Where I work, the supervisors are all black or latino (public institution, so you know how they got their jobs - and you can bet that it ain&rsquo;t from merit, as my experiences daily prove to me!)</p>
<p>The menial workers are also all black and latino save for one working class irish grunt.  Security is 100% non-white.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous bias against white (anglo-saxon) males where I&rsquo;m at.  The only white faces you ever see in authority are members of the &#8216;tribe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What are anglo saxon (and irish, scottish, scandanavian and other northern, founding stock americans) to do?  We are lampooned on TV.  Insulted by rappers.  Denigrated by feminists and constantly pushed out to make room for latinos, asians, and other non-whites being shipped in here by the boatloads.</p>
<p>Now we find out that white males are a MINORITY in colleges now and falling fast.  Time magazine recently did a story celebrating the recession-caused downfall of the middle-aged white male, and I mean it was exultant in tone!</p>
<p>Are we doomed to extinction?</p>

<p>Your place of employment sounds EXACTLY what mine was before I retired. It was, of course, a government job. </p>
<p>As for your question, I would say yes. The majority of Whites are either delusional, apathetic, afraid, and most certainly the most &#8220;forgiving&#8221; race on the planet. They are so afraid of being &#8220;mean spirited&#8221;, thereby they will go happily to their own graves, saying, &#8220;at least God will save me since I was so nice and did &#8220;good&#8221; works by making my &#8220;evil, bigoted&#8221; race disappear&#8221;. THAT is their mindset. </p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t they be shocked when God tells them, Depart from ME, I never knew you&#8221;..</p>

		<p>Poster #45 said:</p>
<p>Once they wimped out their White men, they headed for the controlling, &ldquo;strong protectors&rdquo; with dark men who are everything that they spoke out against during the Feminist movement, when they directed their anger towards White men ONLY.</p>
<p>They said they wanted &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; men..look where it ended up after White men became &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; as they demanded. Now they go with those(hordes)who rape, murder and use force(and kill the bloodline)and aren&rsquo;t very &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; in the least&hellip; Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;   You know, I think about this all the time.  I am around mostly non-whites due to my job  (blacks and latinos) and the way they treat their women is horrible.  Both groups routinely sexually harass any female they choose at any time.  I have seen Latino men on the street striking their women, right in the face, and no one says anything.  Just today I saw a Latino teenager grab a Latino girl by the head and force her to the ground in a frightening display of dominance.  The girl said nothing and the other Latinos standing around were not even fazed.</p>
<p>Where are all the feminists with this growing machismo culture around, and the objectification of women, especially in black culture with the B&rsquo;s and Ho&rsquo;s culture?</p>
<p>The feminists are silent.  Can I write that again.  Silent.</p>
<p>They destroyed the archetype of the chivalrous white male (&#8220;Don&rsquo;t hold that door open for me like I&rsquo;m helpless!&#8221;) and then they give non-white men a free pass to be worse than any white men ever were.  Now feminists generally have embraced the hoochi culture of objectification and say that this &#8216;empowers&rsquo; them.  They are so deluded.</p>

		<p>When I was disabled I had to deal with a great many government agencies on a routine basis. Affirmative action made those encounters with Social Security, the Department of Health, Social Services, Family Support Division, DCSE, and even the county courts absolutely miserable. Obama&rsquo;s reorganization of financial aid also made that process miserable to deal with, and delayed payment for nearly a year. AA made my last years of undergrad far less pleasant, and enjoyable than they would have been otherwise. </p>
<p>I dealt with outright racist behavior, comments, and discrimination in services from black, and most commonly female employees of those agencies on a routine basis. The overt encounters were one thing, but other encounters made me wonder whether I was dealing with racism, or incompetence, but almost always there was this thread of &#8220;we are going to do the minimum possible for you&#8221;. When I encountered a black, female employee of these agencies that was not openly hostile, racist, and actually competent at their jobs it was an exception; I made a note of them, and tried to do my business with them if no white employee was available. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to drive an extra 20-30 miles west, and do business with government agencies in St Charles County versus St Louis County simply due to the degree of AA hiring in St Louis County, and St Louis city proper. The relative pleasantness of government offices on the other side of the bridge will not last, but for the moment the difference is night &amp; day. </p>

<p>Exact same thing happened to me.  I was disabled due to being stabbed and robbed by 3 blacks.  I actually got nothing even though I was absolutely eligile for the victims of crime, disability payments etc.</p>
<p>Although it was a crime with extensive documentation the black female harridan run victims of crime agency did not even pay the dr bills as they were required by law.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Main stream media is doing all they can to hide the ethnicity of people committing crimes who are black, but not hispanic or white. In my newspaper, no picture is given with the article when the perpatrator(s)are black. And it&rsquo;s really a joke when a crime has occurred and the BOLO (be on the lookout) description given to the public does not include the race, unless white or hispanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Father of a friend worked for the St. Louis Post Dispatch.<br>
He can home one day outraged at a memo he and the other reporters received.  </p>
<p>It said that from now on the race and skin color of criminal suspects shall not be mentioned.  From now on the race and skin color of those indicted and on trial for crime may shall not be mentioned.  From now on the race and skin color of convicted criminals, parolees etc shall not be mentioned.</p>

<p>I had to deal with horrible black female government employees who denied me everything possible that to which I was absolutely entitled.</p>
<p>Then within about 5 years all the vicious blacks were replaced by competent hispanics and everything was done promptly and correctly.  It wasn&rsquo;t hard, every bit was done on a computer and it was only a matter of dates and figures on the computer.</p>
<p>I even got $29,000 all the back benefits I had been wrongly denied by the vicious blacks.</p>
<p>There are advantages to immigration. Whites are denied employment,but at least the vicious blacks rulers have been replaced by competent hispanics and asians.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before: Serving in the U.S. Army in Europe, I see that blacks have taken over 90% of the civilian workforce in almost every garrison, and the combat support and combat service support units are 50-60% black soldiers, including the officers. Somehow, I do not think a black-majority military will share the same desire to protect the American People and their homelands as White soldiers generally do. Especially considering that during the recent playing of the Star Spangled Banner at a military ceremony on my installation, half of the black soldiers in my unit refused to stand and salute the flag. Liberal America is in for one hell of a rude awakening.</p>

		<p>The social sciences have long been in the pocket of the left. They are just now waking up to what whites have known for many years, and are simply trying to devise ways to reframe and talk away the hypocrisy, blatant bigotry, and double standards that occur towards whites. I say, respond to their &#8220;expert&#8221; propaganda just like you do to the news ramblings of &#8220;experts&#8221; like Keith Olbermann, turn it off.</p>

		<p>How is it that the many institutions and industry, we the whites created, has ended up in the hands of dark races? They didn&rsquo;t invent it, they didn&rsquo;t build it, they just sat and watched with typical laziness now its becoming theirs. The reason is very simple, some traitors amongst us sold us out because they are wimps and made a deal to benefit themselves whilst we are throw aside like garbage. This is a state of affairs i no longer want any part of and some more like minded people need to stand together and very quickly. They divided us now they will conquer us. Our ingenuity should be able to formulate a plan, i mean we ruled the world before.  In South Africa we are going through some rough times with this affirmative action and the dumbest are now running various departments of government and the corruption is rife. A black said to me that it was the same in the apartheid years which is certainly not true except for De Klerks bribery acceptance to hand the country over to majority rule. This is the brainwashing we are up against and dim minds that cannot think for them selves are hard to change so I fear the final out come as the End Game gains momentum. Very frustrating when we stand so divided.</p>
