			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aislinn Laing, Telegraph, May 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mr Malema said that the government&rsquo;s attempts to return land to black South Africans through negotiations with white farmers had failed, and called for Zimbabwe-style land seizures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to take the land without payment, because the whites took our land without paying and transformed them into game farms. The system of willing seller, willing buyer has failed,&#8221; he told a rally ahead of local elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all agree they stole the land. They are criminals, they should be treated like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>His comments will generate concern among South Africa&rsquo;s white farmers ahead of May 18 elections in which the ANC is expected to lose ground.</p>
<p>Mr Malema, 30, is already facing a race hate trial for singing the protest song Shoot the Boer.</p>
<p>Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe said: &#8220;It can&rsquo;t be correct to generalise like that. It is not scientific or healing,&#8221; Mr Motlanthe said.</p>
<p>Theo de Jager, of AGRI SA which represents South Africa&rsquo;s commercial farmers, said Mr Malema made no distinction between white settlers who came to South Africa 360 years ago and individual farmers today.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they say land has been stolen, they must show us a farmer who has not paid for his land,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst thing that could happen for current landowners is that the governing party do so badly at the polls that they need to do irresponsible things to establish themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Pieter Le Roux, Director of the Institute for Social Development at the University of the Western Cape, said Mr Malema would never have been given a platform by Nelson Mandela or Thabo Mbeki but is now a useful tool for the ANC to mobilise the radical youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s for short-term political gain but does create long-term political concerns,&#8221; he said.<br>

<p>Simply classify everyone who remains productive as a &#8216;criminal&rsquo; so that you can loot their stuff.</p>

		<p>Can you produce some centuries old deeds to prove that it was once &#8220;your land,&#8221; Mr. Malema?  Until then, I&rsquo;ll have to believe that the whites merely took possession of empty land on which very few people lived, and could not successfully cultivate or utilize anyway even if there were more people there.</p>

		<p>When whites settled the land it was all but vacant and uninhabited.</p>
<p>Their big mistake was allowing all the black freeloaders to come in and do their menial work.</p>
<p>As in the US with mestizos, soon the blacks were more numerous and claimed the land as theirs, when all of them migrated from outside the area in order to live off the white man&rsquo;s ingenuity, just as the Mestizos do in the Southwest US.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of stories about South African whites. Indeed, I&rsquo;m sick of stories about whites anywhere in Africa; they don&rsquo;t help our cause in the least.</p>
<p>Now hear me out, before you judge me too harshly; I&rsquo;m not abandoning anyone. How would we feel if they did it to us? Surely if the tables were turned and blacks had forcibly and militarily taken control of parts of Europe, wouldn&rsquo;t we be claiming that they stole the land, and would we not be furious? Wouldn&rsquo;t this be true even if Europeans had by and large deserted this region and it bore but a small rural population of whites? </p>
<p>Europe is our home, Africa is theirs. It&rsquo;s time to accept it, and stop prattling on about poor, sorry Boers. They are not where they are meant to be, regardless of their objections; Africa is not the home of white men. We went there for the sake of power and treasure; the same reasons they now come here. Yes, I realize that the situation in South Africa shows a disparity of treatment; but are we that small, to point and say &#8220;poor us, look how we are treated in their countries!&#8221;?</p>
<p>We will never get anywhere in this struggle appealing to our fellow whites sense of fairness, especially liberals. As far as they are concerned, their own race doesn&rsquo;t count in the first place as a distinct people of worth, so how can any doctrine of fairness apply to a non-entity?</p>
<p>We have to focus on stoking feelings of group worth and dependence. If the group has value, then considering oneself part confers status   &mdash;   humans love status. Status is the entire purpose of latte suburban liberalism. Dependence is obvious; if whites can depend on organizations of racial solidarity, especially for financial and legal purposes, they are much more likely to consider themselves a part, and to contribute to white causes.</p>

		<p>White South Africans need to stand up and say enough is enough.</p>
<p>How can nomadic tribes lay claim to land to which they once used but moved on from. Whites moved in and improved land that was not in use. It is now worth something and the race hustler in charge want it (so the can effectively ruin it before moving on).</p>
<p>This leads into my belief that blacks moving into a nice white neighborhood are essentially commit theft by destroying property values.</p>

		<p>The Julius Malema type is the inevitable final destination of all Black Run governments and schools. As the failure of black government mounts..the desperation sets in..and the return to the only <br>
answer blacks have for everything,..its colonialism, its <br>
slavery, its Jim Crow, its the white man. As blacks spiral down they find ever more debased, more corrupt leaders to give them the lies they need to hear. It always ends in a Malema or a Zuma, or a Mugabe, or a Aristide, a Charles Taylor, a Marion Barry or a Kwame Kilpatrick..always.</p>

		<p>The vast majority of blacks in SA are descended from migrants who came in from further north, seeking to earn some money. The whites needed cheap labor. Sound familiar?<br>
The whites made largely unused lands productive. The blacks will end up destroying everything that has been built up. </p>

<p>Maybe you need some real history lessons about South Africa and WHO built it and settled that land and produced all the food!</p>
<p>Much like America.  There was NOTHING here, (but warring tribes stripping the rivers and lands and then moving on to do the same somewhere else) until the WHITE man came and settled and cleared the land and created a whole civilization, government and laws. </p>

		<p>And the criminal blacks stole the land from the Khoi-san peoples, so they must all go back to the Niger delta where they all originated from. And if they want the whites to go back to Europe, then they must get all their black bruddas and sistas out of Europe so that we can go back. There are more blacks in Europe than there are whites on the whole continent of Africa.</p>

		<p>At the turn of the previous century, there were equal numbers of whites and blacks in SA. The whites kept their families sizes down to what they could afford - the blacks kept breeding indiscriminately and with the white man&rsquo;s medicine, diet, technology, and general ultruism they multiplied their numbers by 12. Now they &#8220;own&#8221; a country that was built in spite of their presence - they contributed zero.</p>

<p>If we follow your logic, whites would have to leave South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Hawaii, etc, etc because all those places were occupied before we got there.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it used to belong to the blacks or anyone else.  We can take it so we did.  All this logic and reasoning is something we use only if it suits our cause.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;the whites took our land without paying&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is one of those &#8220;lies that are repeated until believed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Zulu and all the rest were migrating from points further north into South Africa around the time that the dutch were settling the extreme south and pushing north.</p>
<p>Point is: the lands of south africa were largely EMPTY.  There were a few tiny roving bands of nomads here and there, but no real permanent settlement of any kind in most of the land.</p>
<p>The blacks and whites met and clashed in what is extreme north south africa.  The british came in and were able to hold the migrating blacks at bay with their military muscle.</p>
<p>No one &#8220;stole&#8221; the land from this or that black tribe.  It was empty land.  That south africa brought in cheap african labor from the north is no claim for migrants on the land.</p>
<p>However, this is the pattern.  When poor, illiterate migrants who have the power of youth, vigor and greed on their side enter a more developed land that is tired and decaying from political corruption, they eventually take over.</p>
<p>The germans in the roman empire.  The latinos in the U.S. (who just proposed the splitting of arizona into two states- and so it begins.)  The zulus and others of south africa (who succeeded in taking over and banishing the more civilized nad productive whites.)</p>
<p>Personally, I think the whites of south africa need to abandon the entire eastern half of the land and declare a new country in the western half or third before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>#6 Your whining and ignorance does not help anyone.</p>
<p>We are whites, and although Europe was once our ancient home this is no longer the case. There is signicant white population on almost every continent now, so this is not about borders or propeties, but about our people. Just because they live in Africa does not mean that blacks can treat them like slaves to be killed and their land to be stolen from them. A blatant genocidal racist needs to be stopped. Besides, Africa has natural resources. We should support the whites in SA and in the future, once the complete fall of PC/MC dies down, we can proceed to do what we must in order to save our people and that means saving every single one of them.</p>
<p>Defeatists like you would gladly let a total genocide on them happen, murdering millions, because you cannot stomach what needs to be done. Europe is not our home, since we are now everywhere, like the Jews. Nationalism is a dead concept, we have to think globally now. </p>

<p>Both black and White moved into today&rsquo;s South Africa at about the same time, the aboriginal inhabitants were the Xoi-San people, which would be now as exinct as they are now in Angola, Mosambique, Rhodesia, etc. (where they were all ethnically cleansed by the Bantus) were it not for the White man.</p>

		<p>I note that a few of our posters have noted that SA was first settled by white Europeans; blacks migrated there to take advantage of the opportunies created by these pioneering whites.</p>
<p>The myth that the whites &#8220;stole&#8221; the land from black Africans is one of the most pernicious and durable falsehoods in modern history.  In fact this wild but fertile land was tamed, cultivated, and developed by whites, just as was the North American continent. At least the claims of our Native Americans have some legitimacy in pointing out that they were here first; unfortunately for them, there weren&rsquo;t enough of them to develop this vast continent, and for a variety of reasons they&rsquo;ve been, by and large, unable to adapt to our culture and be fully assimilated.</p>
<p>South African blacks, however, contributed little but manual labor to SA&rsquo;s development, and like black Africans everywhere have shown no capacity for economic, technological, political, and cultural development.  Our nation is filled with examples of once vibrant urban centers, including, perversely, our nation&rsquo;s capital, reduced to crime-ridden, lawless, and decrepit ruins.</p>

		<p>On Censorbugbear there is an interesting report on the proceedings of the Malema hate speech - Kill The Boer - case</p>
<p>In the evidence Malema is once again trotting out the lie that;<br>
&#8220;Blacks (i.e. 80% of the population) only occupy 13% of the land, and that the minority whites (9%) own, control and occupy the remaining 80%. This is simply not true.</p>
<p>To understand the truth behind this lie one must take a look at history and other facts, not just the %s which get trotted out for expediency and to suit a specific agenda. </p>
<p>Here is a brief summary.</p>
<p>The original inhabitants of South Africa were the Khoi (Hottentots) and the San (Bushmen) - small brown people.</p>
<p>They were located in the dry western regions of what is now SA and were hunter gatherers.</p>
<p>After stand-offs with the white settlers (Dutch) they moved north up the west coast.<br>
The San moved into the interior into what is today Namibia and Botswana</p>
<p>The 9 black tribes migrated down from the north from west and central Africa along the eastern side.</p>
<p>They were pastoralists, maintaining cattle and grew limited subsistence crops on a slash and burn basis.</p>
<p>When an area of settlement was denuded they moved on.</p>
<p>White settlers entered SA from the south starting at present day Cape Town<br>
As the white population grew they started expanding eastwards up the Indian Ocean coast</p>
<p>Whites first encountered Blacks c1770 a full 120 years after settling in Africa in 1652.  They met at the Great Fish River which is just east of current day Port Elizabeth</p>
<p>It is clear that historically blacks did not occupy western SA.  It was simply too dry for them to maintain their way of life.  All black tribes were located east of the 40&#8221; isohyet</p>
<p>In 1910 Britain created the Union of South Africa by consolidating the Cape, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State.  In the territories you had: </p>
<p>the 9 black tribes in the east; </p>
<p>whites - 60% Afrikaners &amp; 40% English - spread across all 4 provinces<br>
Coloureds/Mulattos/Mixed Race - in the Western Cape <br>
Indians - in Natal</p>
<p>In 1913 The Land Act was promulgated which identified and reserved the black territories for their exclusive occupation - identical to the Indian Reservations in the USA.</p>
<p>Some of this land had been lost to white settlement but most of it remained intact.<br>
These territories were called Native Reserves by the English Governments from 1910 to 1948</p>
<p>When the predominantly Afrikaner National party came to power in 1948 they were renamed.</p>
<p>First they were called Bantustans and later this was changed to Homelands<br>
White people were not allowed to settle in these territories other than in the established villages and towns.</p>
<p>The countryside was exclusively for the tribes and their traditional way of life.</p>
<p>If you study the geography/topography of SA you will see mountain ranges along the south and east.</p>
<p>They are too steep for habitation and cultivation, besides the soil being unsuitable for cultivation.</p>
<p>These mountains take up a large chunk of space in the east</p>
<p>All of this information brings us to the distorted &#8220;fact&#8221; trotted out by the anti apartheid movements and blacks that they only occupy 13% of the land of South Africa. </p>
<p>The truthful fact is that they probably occupy 80% of the land that they have always lived on.</p>
<p>Now factor in their population explosion made possible through white benevolence and the statistics distort the picture even further.</p>
<p>This &#8220;13% black land&#8221; is now &#8220;the truth&#8221; that the western media and blacks constantly quote - knowing full well it is a lie . </p>
<p>Furthermore in the UK there is the belief that SA blacks had fully developed and functioning societies on a  par with Europe at the time. The white settlers &#8220;stole&#8221; these developed societies and placed the blacks in bondage and reduced them to serfs. </p>
<p>This is simply not true. </p>
<p>There were no roads, bridges, water ways, wheel, horses, architecture beyond  huts, woven apparel, reading, writing, christianity, democracy etc. i.e. none of the developments of technologically and socially advanced Europe. </p>
<p>So nothing was &#8220;stolen&#8221; from black, brown and coloured South Africans. <br>
The exact opposite is true. </p>
<p>Their entire uplift to what these people are today is thanks to the arrival of the white man and his technology, administration, legal system and Christianity</p>
<p>In closing I extract the following quote from Censorbugbear&rsquo;s article:</p>
<p>Tuesday, 10 May 2011<br>
ANC LED BY MALEMA - ON REVOLUTIONARY ROAD</p>
<p>LAND OCCUPATION</p>
<p>One integral part of the NDR (National Democratic Revolution) is land ownership, and this aspect was highlighted by Malema during his evidence. As is the ANC&rsquo;s wont, </p>
<p>Malema repeated the falsity that only 13% of the land is in black hands. [TAU SA (Transvaal Agriculture Union of SA) and others have time and again quoted the 2001 Development Bank showing that 54% of SA&rsquo;s land is in the hands of blacks, coloureds and Indians. Add to this the land that has already been given to blacks under the ANC&rsquo;s restitution legislation, and the figure is more like 65%.]</p>

<p>Their big mistake was allowing all the black freeloaders to come in and do their menial work.</p>
<p>As in the US with mestizos, soon the blacks were more numerous and claimed the land as theirs, when all of them migrated from outside the area in order to live off the white man&rsquo;s ingenuity, just as the Mestizos do in the Southwest US.&#8221;</p>
<p>In every case, from Columbus, to American slavery, to British Imperialism, a large part of the excuse for recruiting natives into laboring for largely private interests was the mission to convert them to Christianity.  That may have had a double effect of somewhat civilizing them, but it has certainly &#8220;boomeranged&#8221; and now Christian values are forcing Westerners to accept them into their homes.  Like Rome, the West will fall as a result and a long, horrid, period of a new Dark Age will ensue. </p>

<p>Geert Wilders has his hands full in The Netherlands. Typically, when people have their home in order, they venture out to help others.  What you are suggesting is the very mechanism that has allowed non-Euros to invade Europe; when eyes are elsewhere the blind-spot is near.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t figure out whether it is blindness or conceit that allows Westerners to think that they can appropriate and assimilate non-Westerners into their nations.  Either way, it is certainly foolishness.</p>

<p>At least the claims of our Native Americans have some legitimacy in pointing out that they were here first; unfortunately for them, there weren&rsquo;t enough of them to develop this vast continent, and for a variety of reasons they&rsquo;ve been, by and large, unable to adapt to our culture and be fully assimilated.<br>

<p>No, there is no &#8220;legitimacy&#8221; with the Indians claims that they were here first.  </p>
<p>Maybe you can watch this series on the first Americans&hellip;.we have been told for so long that the Indians are the &#8220;native&#8221; Americans that most believe it. What is tat saying, tell a lie long enough and it will become a truth&#8221;?</p>

Simply classify everyone who remains productive as a &lsquo;criminal&rsquo; so that you can loot their stuff.<br>
Is this where anarcho-tyranny ultimately leads a society?&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is completely within the rule of multiculturalism. As MC is about having several groups of people in the same state, who maybe dont agree about essential matters, democracy becomes a tool where you in legal manners can actually rob minor or unaware groups.<br>
It is also possible in homogeneous states, as the fairness of taxes and redistribution wealth is ALWAYS a debatable matter. Most of the time this redistribution does not cause much stir, so its possible to say its fair and just. But it should never be taken for granted that it will be.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t some of you posters ever read the real history of South Africa or of Africa? There is NO double standard here! Who built and created South Africa from scratch?  Black Africans? Were they even in South Africa BEFORE the Boers came and made it a prosperous part of Africa and THEN the blacks poured in to take the spoils?   </p>

		<p>Exclusive: How Malema made his millions<br>
Sunday, 21 February 2010 00:00<br>
Written by Times Live by BUDDY NAIDU and SIMPIWE PILISO<br>
ANC Youth League president Julius Malema&rsquo;s millionaire lifestyle is being bank-rolled by lucrative government contracts awarded to his companies.</p>
<p><br>
A Sunday Times investigation has found that, despite his claims to the contrary, Malema has benefited substantially from several tenders - and that most of them stem from his home province Limpopo, where he wields significant influence.</p>
<p>One of Malema&rsquo;s businesses, a small engineering firm, has profited from more than R130-million worth of tenders in just two years.</p>
<p>Malema&rsquo;s lavish lifestyle - from his luxury homes, Gucci suits, Breitling watches and parties where his guests are served R700 bottles of whisky and Moët&Chandon; champagne - flies in the face of a politician who claims to earn a &#8220;middle income&#8221; salary.</p>
<p>Malema has often warned ANC supporters to be wary of individuals who cannot explain the source of their fortune.</p>
<p>But when asked about his business dealings yesterday, Malema said: &#8220;That is none of your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sunday Times has seen documents which show that SGL Engineering Projects and its subsidiaries, which Malema co-owns with Lesiba Gwangwa, have been awarded dozens of contracts since 2003 - often from cash-strapped municipalities in Limpopo.</p>
<p>The projects range from road and pavement construction to bulk water supply and upgrading cemeteries.</p>
<p>Asked about his involvement in SGL and its subsidiaries, and the string of tenders awarded to them, Malema responded: &#8220;What gives you the power to ask me that question? Let me tell you, I do not owe you any answer, to be honest. I am not accountable to you &hellip; I am accountable to the ANCYL and ANC. My organisations have never raised any concerns about those things.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no law that says politicians can&rsquo;t be businessmen. The problem with you is that when an African child is emerging and becoming successful, that is when you have a problem. That is your major problem that causes you sleepless nights.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to see us dying in poverty. That is what you are committed to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Official tender and government documents show that Malema - who has been dubbed a &#8220;tenderpreneur&#8221; (someone politically well-connected who has got rich through the government tendering system) - was involved in more than 20 contracts, each worth between R500000 and R39-million between 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>Malema&rsquo;s share funded his two luxury homes, worth about R4.6-million.</p>
<p>While he has been seen driving a fleet of cars from a C63 Mercedes-Benz AMG, to an Aston Martin and a Range Rover, none of them is registered in his name. The only car registered in his name is a 2005 Audi A4.</p>
<p>Malema, the son of a former domestic worker, matriculated in 2001. Now, as co-owner of SGL, Malema is worth millions.</p>
<p>But yesterday Malema repeatedly refused to discuss his involvement in SGL.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing to do with their operations. I know nothing about what is happening in SGL, where are they making their money, where do they get tenders. I know nothing about that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Attempts to contact Gwangwa were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Besides being listed as a consultant for the Waterberg District Municipality, Gwangwa also sits on the board of Magalies Water, a state-owned water board which provides a range of related water and sanitation services to Gauteng, Limpopo, North West and Mpumalanga.</p>
<p>Although the Sunday Times could not establish whether SGL and its subsidiaries have cashed in on Magalies Water contracts, the firm was involved in a R2.1-million sewerage upgrade project, which was awarded by the Waterberg District Municipality and completed in July last year.</p>
<p>Other projects awarded to SGL between 2007 and 2008, include:</p>
<p>•    A R39.3-million sewer reticulation project awarded by the Mopani District Municipality;<br>
•    A R27.9-million street paving and drainage contract allocated by the Greater Letaba Local Municipality; and<br>
•    A R28-million tender for several municipal infrastructure projects from the Tzaneen Municipality.<br>
While the public documents reveal that some of the projects were completed on schedule, the majority of projects were not.</p>
<p>Other municipalities that have given contracts to SGL include Lepelle-Nkumpi, Bojanala Platinum District Municipality, Vhembe District Municipality, Mutale, Makhado, and Tzaneen District Municipality.</p>
<p>SGL was also awarded a tender by Roads Agency Limpopo (RAL), which has a budget of over R2-billion, and which is headed by Sello Rasethaba, a close friend of Malema.</p>
<p>Rasethaba was appointed last year shortly after Malema&rsquo;s ally, Limpopo premier Cassel Mathale, took office.</p>
<p>Another company that has boosted Malema&rsquo;s bank balance is Ever Roaring Investments, which made millions from managing and organising the state-funded annual Mapungubwe Jazz Festival in Polokwane.</p>
<p>According to government officials and politicians who oversaw the awarding of the multi-million-rand contract, it never went out to tender - until recently.</p>
<p>Last year the contract was awarded by tender to Ziyaphenduka Promotions.</p>
<p>Government officials in Limpopo painted a detailed picture of how the ANCYL president&rsquo;s businesses secured repeated tenders.</p>
<p>While Malema&rsquo;s companies often bid for the tenders, some of the contracts are awarded to contractors closely linked to him, who then subcontract his company.</p>
<p>Malema, through SGL, was recently selected as a service provider for government projects including the &#8220;implementation of roads and storm-water projects&#8221; for the current financial year.</p>
<p>SGL would therefore be a frontrunner in the rush to benefit from the Limpopo government&rsquo;s request for a R5-billion loan from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), to build and upgrade roads in the province.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times has established that Limpopo province has applied for the loan, but the development bank&rsquo;s Rosemary Mangope declined to comment.</p>
<p>The SA Communist Party and trade union federation Cosatu have repeatedly warned against &#8220;a culture of tenderpreneurship&#8221;.</p>
<p>SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande described tenderpreneurs as the &#8220;biggest threat to our revolution&#8221;, and Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has called for a &#8220;lifestyle audit&#8221; of politicians &#8221;living in expensive houses and throwing lavish parties&#8221;.</p>
<p>Malema said he would welcome such an audit. &#8220;All of us need to be audited. We are agreeing with Cosatu, as the youth league. We are saying that anyone high profile in politics must be audited.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are prepared to go for a lifestyle audit, conducted by the democratic institutions of our government - if that (process) is well arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finance minister Pravin Gordhan this week announced that a task team would investigate corruption in tender and tender and procurement processes in all nine provincial governments</p>
<p>•    Malema&rsquo;s businesses all share an office bought and registered under Segwalo Consulting Engineers in Limpopo&rsquo;s capital, Polokwane.<br>
The office, in Fauna Park, was bought for R1-million in August 2006, with a bond registered for R950000 with First National Bank. Besides SGL and Ever Roaring Investments, Malema is also a director of Blue Nightingale Trading 61 and 101 Junjus Trading.</p>
<p>In his own words<br>
•    &#8220;We are the elite that has been deliberately produced by the ANC as part of its policy to close the gap between blacks and whites in this country. It was the ANC that made it possible that, as part of that elite, some of us are now able to live in the suburbs.&#8221; - Explaining in December 2008 that the salary he receives from the party makes him part of the black middle class.<br>
•    &#8220;People go to the township and boast about drinking imported, expensive liquor and the German sedans they drive. This is an insult to the people. What type of message are you sending when you change cars like you are changing shirts?&#8221; - Speaking at Esselen Park, where the ANC held its three-day election manifesto conference in December 2008.<br>
•    &#8220;Being involved in business compromises the independence of the ANCYL because every time you open your mouth, you must check if business will be happy or not.&#8221; - Following Malema&rsquo;s decision to close down the ANCYL&rsquo;s investment arm, Lembede Investments, which was fraught with allegations of corruption.<br>
•    &#8220;Never be scared to iron out problems with your mayors and municipal managers because they are your servants. We voted them into power so that they can serve us and not enrich themselves or those close to them.&#8221; - Speaking at the Peter Mokaba memorial lecture in Vereeniging in September last year.<br>
•    &#8220;The rich keep getting richer and it is white males who continue to own the means of production in the country. Not even Tokyo (Sexwale), who is the minister of human settlements, is an owner. Tokyo is owing the white baas because he wants to borrow from the banks. Who owns the banks? Tokyo is a rich man, but he doesn&rsquo;t own.&#8221; - Speaking at the 16th national congress of the South African Students&rsquo; Congress in Durban in December last year.<br>
