	<p>Hidden video cameras caught Shantaniqua Scott placing a blanket over her four-month-old son&rsquo;s mouth</p>
<p>This is the shocking moment a teenage mother attempts to smother her baby in a hospital.</p>
<p>Hidden video cameras caught 18-year-old Shantaniqua Scott placing a blanket over her four-month-old son&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Moments later she clamps her hand over his face and mouth as the newborn baby kicks and struggles for life.</p>
<p>By the time the single mother removes her hand her son Raymond&rsquo;s body appears limp.</p>
<p>Seconds later, with alarms going off indicating the baby had stopped breathing, doctors and nurses rush in to resuscitate him.</p>
<p>The footage was played to a shocked courtroom in Texas where Scott is on trial for attempting to kill her newborn son.</p>
<p>Jurors sat in rapt silence as the video tape recorded at the Cook Children&rsquo;s Medical Center in July 2010 was played in a Fort Worth courtroom.</p>
<p>They had heard how Scott&rsquo;s son had been taken into hospital after he was reported to have suddenly stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Doctors who examined him at first thought he suffered from severe acid reflux.</p>
<p>He underwent surgery to correct the condition  &mdash;  when acid from the stomach backs up into the oesophagus  &mdash;  and was released from hospital.</p>
<p>But two days later he was back in the emergency unit after he mysteriously stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Staff suspected he was the victim of abuse and set up a hidden camera on the ward where the baby was recovering.</p>
<p>Scott is seen peering into her son&rsquo;s cot and placing a blanket over his face for up to 20 seconds.</p>
<p>When a nurse briefly enters the room Scott paces the floor and appears to check her cell phone.</p>
<p>Then, when left alone she reaches into the cot and with her bare hand clamps it over her baby son&rsquo;s mouth and nose.</p>
<p>The video records her trying to suffocate her son for one minute and 14 seconds.</p>
<p>Heart and lung specialist Dr Sami Heed said the baby would have died but for the intervention of staff when his monitors sounded an alarm.</p>
<p>He told the court: &#8216;I still get emotional. I get night sweats when I think about it. I take care of the sickest of the sick. His life was being put in danger by someone who was supposed to take care of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jurors were told that Scott confessed to police she no longer wanted to care for her son and in a taped confession admitting smothering him.</p>
<p>Sgt Pedro Criado of the Fort Worth Police Department said Scott told detectives she didn&rsquo;t want her child anymore.</p>
<p>&#8216;She just basically stated that she wanted to go back to that carefree attitude she had before she had the child,&rsquo; Sgt Criado said.</p>
<p>She also said it was hard being a teenage mother, complained that the baby&rsquo;s father didn&rsquo;t help and added that she didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the stress anymore.</p>
<p>Doctors said it is not known if the child will have any lasting injuries from the lack of oxygen. He is being looked after by social workers.</p>
<p>Scott faces life imprisonment if convicted of two counts of causing serious bodily injury to a child.</p>

								<h2>Baby Found in Trash </h2>
						<p><i>Andrew Grossman, Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2011</i></p>
<p>Police pulled a newborn baby boy with his umbilical cord still attached out of a trash compactor in a Fort Greene housing project Sunday morning, according to a law-enforcement official familiar with the case.</p>
<p>Police arrested a woman they believe to be his mother, 18-year-old Laquasia Wright, and charged her with attempted murder and endangering the welfare of a child. {snip}<br/>

		<p>I am going to be quite evil here but I simply do not care what Shantaquisha does to her child.  The public will just end up support him for the rest of his life.  From the medicaid that paid for his birth and his subsequent hospital stays to the TANF his mother collected before going to prison to the Foster care payments and SSI he&rsquo;ll get now right up to the TANF and medicaid his illigimate off-spring will collect and then his prison costs when he finally gets caught.  NO, sorry, I have no sympathy left in me.  None.  My only sympathy is for the white children who will have to go to school with him and be subject to his brutality.</p>

		<p>Note that White people were taxed to pay for this birth, the subsequent operation, and the hospital room.  White people will stop at nothing to make sure that the demographic tide of Third World Peoples continues to increase, and eventually replace White people.  No amount of our money is enough to assure our demise.</p>

<p>You aren&rsquo;t being &#8220;evil&#8221; whatsoever. We have been conditioned to think what is good is really evil. I believe the Bibles even says something about that&hellip;We are now living in that world. </p>
<p>I have felt the same way as you do for years now. There is far too much misguided (stupid) empathy among our folks for far to long.<br/>

		<p>I agree completely with 2-Istvan. I no longer care what the Shantaniquas of the world do to their children. The unbridled birth rate of black and brown people the world over more than makes up for their deaths. All they do is breed with no thought as to what conditions their children will be subjected to or whether they can afford to feed or clothe them. Just let society pay for it! Like the world has limitless resources of clean water and food. Isn&rsquo;t it funny with all the talk about recycling and &#8220;going green&#8221;, you never hear a peep about the unchecked birth rate.</p>

<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>18 is only technically a teen ager. 18 year olds are adults who should be working, in the military, in college or caring for their children.  The world is full of 18 year old and younger Mothers caring for their children, especially in Shqaqss Scott&rsquo;s mileu.</p>

		<p>The only reason the poor child exists is because it&rsquo;s mother was too ignorant to use birth control and too lazy to get an abortion.</p>
<p>I do feel sorry for the poor child.  Which is more cruel, an abortion to end his life or a life in special education, prison, poverty and welfare?  I really wonder. </p>
<p>And Republicans are generally against abortion!  They need to get real.   </p>

<p>Well actually you did several years back but it was directed only at White people. That goal has already been achieved with the help of all the White sheep.<br/>
Shanitiqua or whatever her name is should be given a revolver with one round in the cylinder and instructed to do the right thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I have to respond to this comment.  This sort of attitude is absolutely not acceptable to me and I&rsquo;m sure this is not acceptable to most of the people who visit this site.  I believe firmly in the principles that this site stands for, but one of those principles is NOT letting defenseless children die at the hands of monsters!</p>
<p>We are not going to advance the principles of this movement by leaving vile and evil comments on this site.  I&rsquo;m not for censorship but I am for the right to respond.  We are about asserting and affirming our European principles.  Yes, we can fight and inflict damage in DEFENSE of our homes and heritage.  But to say innocent children of any race dying is something to be viewed as a relief is simply not virtuous.</p>
<p>Please examine your conscience before you post your comments please.<br/>

<p>I hear many white women who say they don&rsquo;t want kids because they are enjoying their &#8220;childfree&#8221; freedom. It&rsquo;s the Asian and Indian moms who have the strong family values to have babies and the Asian and Indian fathers who work hard and support their babies without relying on white taxpayers. Our kids are studious, disciplined and make great assets in white societies. Too bad whites aren&rsquo;t have as many kids as they used to. The smartest whites are the ones who decide not to have kids and that&rsquo;s why the tech industry is being taken over by brainy Indians and Chinese. </p>
<p>When we become the primary tax base in America in 30 years or so, we promise to end welfare and mollycoddlying of low IQ thugs.</p>

		<p>Dear Cape to Cairo: Post #11,</p>
<p>You are a hypocrite!  I challenge you to stand by your beliefs, by sending Shantaquisha 1/2 of your paycheck from now on, or by adopting her baby (and the 3-6 additional babies she will have over the next 15 years).  You are a morally superior person.  Go ahead, I dare you.</p>
<p>For me and my wife (who work 95 hrs/week and who struggle to support our children), I am tired of having to also support Black patholologies, including Shantaquisha, through our oppressive tax burden.  I am tired at having to deny MY children, in order to pay for Shantaquish&rsquo;s children.  If you want to supoport Shantaquish and her kind, that&rsquo;s fine; just don&rsquo;t ask ME to do it any more.<br/>

<p>I&rsquo;m poster #7., and I have MORE compassion and conscience than a lot of people in this country.</p>
<p>What is unacceptable to me is the indiscriminant breeding of these people and the lack of caring by their own parents. But more disgusting are the bleeding hearts like you who would cry over their children without any concern for the white children who are being ignored and brutilized by these brown children when they grow up. </p>
<p>Because, like most easily manipulated people who don&rsquo;t question our mass media outlets, all they have to do is show the pictures of how cute these little babies are and they know you people will be like putty in their hands. Your above post proves it.</p>
<p>And like most easily manipulated people, you missed the point. Myself and others are no longer going to waste our precious sympathectic feelings on a situation that, after 40 years, is still there and getting worse, overly funded with OUR money by our corrupt government.</p>
<p>Oh, and those cute little babies? They grow up. Either permentantly damaged by the abuse which our taxes will have to support them for the rest of their lives, or most will turn out to be the future criminals in this country.</p>
<p>I used to think like you. Until I woke up and shook off the mass brainwashing by the liberal elites who could care less about hard working, law abiding citizens like myself.  </p>

<p>  I&rsquo;m afraid there is more to it than that. Indians and Chinese are given Affirmative Action preference and are frequently hired at a lower salary than Native born white Americans. Some Firms like Microsoft and Intel seem to go out of their way to bring in labor from abroad. It&rsquo;s called the H1B Visa racket: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaofpy3D-oE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uaofpy3D-oE</a></p>

They get government loans &#8220;for minorities only&#8221;, they put their old folks on SSA right away, they cheat and commit FRAUD all the time. They sure know how to work the system, if that is what you mean.

<p>When a lot of your income goes to taxes, it&rsquo;s a bit hard to support a large family.  My husband and I are white high-school graduates.  We have only one child because that is all we can afford to raise.  And we live in a shoebox of an apartment (though at least it&rsquo;s in a nice neighborhood).</p>
<p>And no doubt what&rsquo;s taken from us goes to support children of other races.  It&rsquo;s almost like a genocide by taxes!</p>

<p> The fact is, these &#8216;brainy&rsquo; Asians are merely browbeaten and compliant, work by rote, have almost zero creativity and are eager to take the fall for know-nothing management.<br/>
 Asians might take over the day to day workings of IT, but for innovation and creativity outside of a structured, micromanaged, daily grind, results driven environment you&rsquo;ll find little else but the archetypical Asian stagnation.<br/>

Based upon thousands of years of endeavors in the quest for knowledge, we white people have figured some stuff out. It will be of no avail to people of color. As this tidal wave of humanity crashes towards us we will see much more of their depredations that insult us to the very core of our sensibilities. </p>

<p>These people don&rsquo;t read and they don&rsquo;t know these things. Remember: their average IQ is 80; an IQ of 85 is retarded.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, I was just watching one of those &#8216;caught on camera&rsquo;<br/>
shows the other day,the show was at least an hour long and it was the same as all the others I have seen.<br/>
There was not one I repeat,not one, NON - BLACK invovled in any of the crimes being shown.<br/>
We are  called racist if we tell the truth about what is &#8216;still&rsquo;one of our countries mager problems.<br/>
Another isssue we need to wake up to is that &#8220;white people&#8221; are being attacked by our own government. They must summit us,take away our ability to fight back, (this is done by taking our weapons,food,homes  and jobs to make us DEPENDENT UPON THEM.<br/>
Sound familar. Buy what is needed to protect you nad your family and  prepare. No I am not crazy,I am awake and aware.</p>

		<p>Poster 13 mentioned asian owned retail stores in black negihborhoods.</p>
<p>The American government gave the asians and indians those stores.<br/>
It is some sort of urban renewal program that has been going on about 45 years. At one time it was called minority set aside. The name changes but the program remains the same.</p>
<p> The original idea was to give blacks businesses in black ghettoes.  The small black businesses would thrive and provide employment.  The neighborhood would become better.  At the time the program started Jackson and the rest of the non profit pimps were screeching about black ownership of business.</p>
<p>So the program started.  Instead of using the word black, the word minority was used.  Blacks prefered do nothing government jobs to a small business where they would have to work and horror of horrors actually have to conform to the franchisors standards or go out of business.</p>
<p>So the businesses were given to non white asian, arab and indian immigrants.  They get SBA loans to buy the businesses.  They get tax exemptions for 5 years.  They are never inspected for zoning and industrial violations.  They can evade sales taxes with impunity.  Every 5 years they transfer ownership to another family member to avoid federal, state and local taxes, espeially sales tax. The loans get rolled over every 5 years and are never repaid.</p>
<p>Many do not even bother to renew their city business license.  They may have employees but they deduct the payroll taxes and keep the money rather than sending it in to the government every 3 months.  </p>
<p>They bring in older relatives, and get them on SSI while working full time in the business.  Many of the asians run massage parlor/brothels with slave labor as well as the business the SBA gave them.</p>
<p>That is why there are so many asian, arab and indians businesses in the ghettoes.  Our government put and keeps them there with our tax money.</p>

<p>I so agree with you.  Every time I see one of those christian or commie save the children ads I want to retch.  I look at those kids and I have no desire to help them.  All I can think is that they will grow up, immigrate to America and get an affirmative action job.</p>
<p>When I look at one of the boys, I picture him in a few years toting a gun as big as he is rampaging and raping through one of the standard african upheavals.  When I see the cute little girls I see an arrogant black sow of a government worker making it impossible to do business with her agency due to her incompetence and hatred of her customers.</p>
<p>I am a woman and I have unusually strong maternal instincts. But I feel no desire to help the blacks of this world because of what blacks have done and will continuing doing to Whites.</p>
