	<span class="dropcap">T</span>he events of Sept. 11 
temporarily pushed reparations for slavery back from their position 
halfway into the mainstream. At a time of national crisis it would have 
seemed piggish to demand even justified entitlements. Still, reparations
 were hardly gone for good, and as normalcy returns, blacks and their 
allies are renewing their demands for vast sums to compensate for 
misdeeds real and imaginary. In March, chairman of the US Commission on 
Civil Rights, Mary Francis Berry, said reparations are the &#8220;unfinished 
business of the civil rights movement,&#8221; and even the New York City 
Council recently voted to &#8220;study&#8221; the reparations question. Blacks will 
soon be back demanding payment, and whites must be prepared to respond.

        <p> To be sure, to judge from polls, most whites oppose 
reparations. But they must oppose them for the right reasons, not 
because they are inopportune or overblown, but because they are an 
outrageous expression of ingratitude and gall. Unless whites can 
articulate the right case against reparations, they will end up watching
 in bewildered impotence the adoption of measures they know to be wrong,
 just as they did in the case of affirmative action. </p>
        <p> Replies to the demand for reparations may be graded by their power to shock. Some might be heard on <i>60 Minutes,</i>
 some would raise eyebrows, and others would call down execration as 
racist. Unfortunately, all the publicly permitted arguments concede too 
much, which means only the forbidden ones are worth raising. </p>
        <p> Let us divide objections into the polite, the impolite, the 
rude and the shocking. The commonest polite argument is that reparations
 would cost too much   &mdash;   a sound enough point as far as it goes, given the
 rapacity of the civil rights lobby. Some claimants put the debt to 
American and African blacks at several trillion dollars. One ever-handy 
yardstick that yields these remarkable figures are race differences in 
economic outcomes   &mdash;   there are many   &mdash;   which are automatically ascribed to
 &#8220;discrimination&#8221; rather than differences in ability. Thus <i>Ebony</i> 
bases reparations on &#8220;A study out of the University of California at 
Berkeley [that] showed that the value of the income lost as a 
consequence of racial discrimination between 1929 and 1969 alone comes 
to about $1.6 trillion.&#8221; (Whites of course beg for such finger-pointing 
by obsessively rehearsing their past sins.) A second type of estimate 
looks to precedents, notably the $20,000 paid by the US government to 
each Japanese relocated during the Second World War. That amount paid to
 40 million blacks   &mdash;   and they would certainly want far more   &mdash;   would come
 to $800 billion. Similar calculations cite German payments to Jewish 
Holocaust survivors, whose dominance in the victim sweepstakes irks many
 blacks greatly. </p>
        <p> A third formula treats the average price of a slave 200 
years ago   &mdash;   about $14,000 in current dollars   &mdash;   as stolen human capital 
on which interest has steadily been compounding. Given a modest three 
percent average annual interest rate corresponding to economic growth   &mdash;   
in this one case reparationists will doubtless be generous in their 
estimates of the productive capacity of capitalism   &mdash;   each slave&rsquo;s estate
 is $2.8 million short. For every million Africans enslaved, their 
current descendents are thereby collectively owed $2.8 trillion. </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th>Perhaps each white could work for blacks two weeks annually for 25 years, in shifts. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> The alleged debt to the continent of Africa runs higher 
still, and must cover not only the labor of an estimated fifteen to a 
wildly exaggerated one hundred million abductees, but the removal of 
natural resources. People making this calculation never mention the 
involvement of Africans in the slave trade who, to be consistent, should
 also be asked to pay, or the fact that natural resources like oil and 
diamonds were of no use to Africans and could not be extracted by 
technology indigenous to Africa. Notwithstanding these objections, white
 depredations are said to have cost Africa $7 trillion, for a total bill
 typically greater than $10 trillion. </p>
        <p> Bear in mind that all the goods produced in the US last year
 were worth roughly $9 trillion, which in turn represented nearly one 
fourth of total world output. Reparationists thus in effect demand that 
American whites work solely for blacks for a year or more, or that the 
whole white race carry that burden for a good part of a year. My wife 
once proposed this bargain: Whites should give blacks a large lump sum 
in exchange for a promise never to ask for more or say one more word 
about whites, racism, slavery or all the rest. I explain below why the 
black end of this deal would be hard to keep, and anyway no society 
could survive the diversion of so much energy at one go. </p>
        <p> Of course, to object to reparations only because of the cost prompts an obvious question: What if whites <i>could</i>
 afford it? If whites insist on citing poverty as their excuse, then if 
future productivity some day makes it possible to pay, pay they must. To
 plead only poverty admits the debt, and once the reparations principle 
is granted, all that remains to be discussed is the payment schedule. 
Perhaps each white could work for blacks two weeks annually for 25 
years, in shifts so as to minimize the economic shock. Perhaps blacks 
could be exempted from taxation for a few centuries. Clearly, whites 
simply disarm themselves by whining that they are short on cash, 
although respectable white opinion may be counted on to fall into this 
trap, for fear of saying anything more offensive. We had better turn to 
less polite objections. </p>
        <p> Under this heading fall requests for specifics where 
reparationists are vague   &mdash;   chiefly about who is going to pay, and for 
what. Is it to be the federal government, state governments, 
corporations, individuals, or someone else? There are vast problems with
 assessing individuals, particularly those whose ancestors owned no 
slaves. How have blacks been harmed by a New Englander whose family had 
always promoted &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; or by anyone whose grandparents didn&rsquo;t 
come to America until 1930? </p>
        <p> It is impossible to calculate the gains even of indirect 
beneficiaries of slavery. Take a man whose great-grandfather clerked in a
 store that sold shirts made with cotton harvested by slaves; surely he 
owes less than descendents of the people who owned the slaves, but how 
much less? Suppose it were somehow determined that half of 
great-grandpa&rsquo;s salary was tainted by slavery, but that wise investments
 increased his wealth twenty-fold. Do his heirs owe half their holdings 
to blacks, or just one-fortieth? </p>
        <p> Reparationists must answer these difficult questions because
 the damages they demand are compensatory, not punitive. Slaveholders 
and other wrongdoers are no longer alive to be punished; a present-day 
white, having harmed no one, owes at most what he has gained from wrongs
 done by others, so tallying his debt demands detailed knowledge of what
 he actually gained. No one has this information, and the further in the
 past the wrongs were done, the less accessible it becomes. </p>

          <tbody><tr>
            <th> <b> Black slums receive a &#8220;Marshal Plan&#8221; about once 
every three years, a rate that every few decades amounts to another 
trillion dollars.</b> </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Because individual fault is incalculable, reparationists 
tend to look to &#8220;government&#8221; to pay. But which government(s)? The states
 seem the natural targets, since their laws regulated slavery and, 
subsequently, segregation. Indeed, the federal government ended slavery,
 overrode state segregation, and eventually came to require favoritism 
for blacks, so it hardly seems fair to foist a bill for damages on the 
party that tried hardest to stop them. To be sure there were federal 
fugitive slave laws, and the federal judiciary upheld slavery in Dred 
Scott. Still, on balance, the national government was instrumental in 
relieving the conditions reparationists decry. But if the states are to 
pay, then which states? Surely not those that banned slavery or entered 
the Union after it ended. (Further complications are raised by 
territories that became states: Are states responsible for their 
territorial history, or are they new entities? Reparationists must make 
this clear.) The best candidates are the members of the old Confederacy,
 but, apart from the shallowness of their pockets, once again, many of 
their current residents   &mdash;   the taxpayers who would foot the bill   &mdash;   have 
no connection to past wrongs. For these reasons, one may expect the 
claimants to discover sooner or later that the debt is a &#8220;national&#8221; 
problem, which &#8220;all Americans&#8221; have to solve together. </p>
        <p> But however the scope issue is resolved, there is a second: 
Is a government   &mdash;   local, state or federal   &mdash;   responsible only for what it
 does, or also for what it merely permits by failing to outlaw? The 
distinction is important because most of the practices for which 
repayment is demanded, particularly slavery and discrimination in jobs 
and housing, were private. Antebellum governments neither owned slaves 
nor forced anyone to buy them; they simply allowed ownership. Likewise, 
while some states did segregate some of their own institutions (schools,
 for example) and require some private segregation (on trains, for 
example) much of the discrimination reparationists complain of was 
undertaken by private individuals using their property in ways 
consistent with but not required by law. </p>
        <p> One might defend a wider view of government responsibility 
on the grounds that government must protect rights actively, not only by
 respecting them itself but by preventing others from breaching them. 
There is something to the idea that permitting great wrongs is state 
negligence, but it can be taken too far. </p>
        <p> To begin with, there is a general presumption against <i>post facto </i>judgment.
 Normally, no entity is held to account for something that was legal 
when it was done, as were slavery and discrimination. What would 
reparationists say if states a century from now were fined for once 
having allowed private corporations to discriminate against whites via 
quotas? Likewise, if blacks are entitled to <i>post facto </i>compensation
 for acts that were legal when committed, why not everyone else? Should 
women sue because, in the past, they could not vote? Should workers sue 
because their ancestors had to work more than 40 hours a week and did 
not get maternity leave? </p>
        <table class="boxleft">

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Even waiving the general case against post facto guilt, not 
every private misdeed can be laid at the feet of government: Vandals, 
not the city, are responsible for defacing a neighbor&rsquo;s wall, although 
stationing police on every corner would have stopped them. A line must 
be drawn somewhere, beyond which governments are innocent of the abuses 
of the freedoms they allow. </p>
        <p> Finally, even if states are held to absurdly strict 
standards today for what happened in the past, they may still be 
innocent of many acts for which they are retrospectively scolded, 
because these acts themselves were innocent. Slavery, discrimination in 
jobs, housing and service, and social stigma are usually lumped together
 in one ugly pile to which &#8220;government&#8221; turned a blind eye, but they are
 quite different. Slavery does infringe rights that any government 
should protect (although, to repeat, back pay for manumitted slaves 
would be owed only by former owners). But it is hard to see the right 
violated by, say, refusing to hire blacks. An employer&rsquo;s hiring choices 
are covered by his right to free association. The blacks he refuses to 
hire are no worse off than they would have been had he never existed, so
 how does he harm them? Since laws against private discrimination may 
well themselves be wrong, governments were hardly to blame for not 
passing them sooner. </p>
        <p> Still another precept reparationists ignore is that not 
every beneficiary of an injury must help repair the victim. Let us grant
 for now   &mdash;   lest we be rude   &mdash;   that today&rsquo;s whites are richer than today&rsquo;s
 blacks because of slavery. It still does not follow that all of today&rsquo;s
 whites owe today&rsquo;s blacks anything. Suppose Smith and Jones own the 
only two restaurants in town; a firebug burns down Smith&rsquo;s place, 
causing Jones&rsquo;s business to improve. So long as Jones had no hand in the
 arson, he owes Smith nothing. The recent terrorist attack on New York 
prompted some businesses to move to New Jersey, yet no one thinks New 
Jersey owes New York reparations even though New Jersey is now richer. 
As far as Jones is concerned, Smith&rsquo;s fire might as well have been a 
kitchen accident. Note that the arsonist&rsquo;s motives do not matter: 
Whether he did it from psychosis, a desire for gain, admiration of 
Jones, hatred of Smith, or hatred of Smith&rsquo;s race, Jones is not guilty. 
Assuming that contemporary whites have benefited from racial wrongs, 
white beneficiaries, to be liable, must have abetted these wrongs, 
failed to stop them, or at least culpably ignored them. It is impossible
 to show this since the disputed wrongs, particularly slavery, took 
place before any whites living today were born. </p>

        <p> <em>A propos</em> whites&rsquo; supposed enjoyment of the un-or 
undercompensated fruits of black labor, reparationists frequently claim 
that &#8220;blacks built America.&#8221; This is patently untrue. At no time have 
blacks been a substantial part of the US population, and until the 
Second World War they lived largely in the rural South; they were a part
 of southern agriculture but played virtually no role in the development
 of the large cities, industrial complexes, universities and public 
projects that support American prosperity. In fact, it is precisely 
those parts of the country with the largest proportion of blacks that 
have traditionally been the poorest, which is the reverse of what we 
would expect if blacks were the source of American prosperity. Canada, 
Australia, and New Zealand were English colonies that developed during 
the same period as the United States. If slavery was the basis of 
American prosperity, how did these countries achieve comparable levels 
of prosperity without it? Blacks did not contribute significantly to 
science, medicine or technology. America would have been different 
without blacks, but not poorer. </p>
        <p> There is a final point about compensatory justice that 
sounds abstruse but is worth mentioning. If not for slavery, blacks 
living in America today, the ones who supposedly deserve reparations, 
would not exist. Their great-great-grandparents would never have met, 
and they would never have been born. It is obvious that a person cannot 
be harmed by an action that accounts for his existence. You harm Smith 
by making him worse off than he would have been had you not done 
whatever you did; if what you did helped bring Smith into existence (for
 instance if it involved introducing his parents to each other), he can 
hardly say he would have been better off if you had not done it, since 
in that case there would have been no Smith at all. (This is why 
&#8220;wrongful birth&#8221; suits brought by unhappy children against their parents
 seem ludicrous.) A committed black reparationist might say his life in 
America is so dreadful he would prefer never to have been born at all, 
but otherwise he has no reply. </p>
        <p> Aside from these historical and philosophical points, the 
demand for payments to blacks calls to mind a larger issue that arose 
about quotas: It seemed unfair to pass over young whites in favor of 
less-qualified blacks who allegedly would have been more qualified in a 
just world, when the whites were not themselves to blame for the black&rsquo;s
 substandard abilities. Indeed the whole reparations debate 
recapitulates the affirmative action debate. And this leads to rude 
questions: Weren&rsquo;t quotas supposed to be reparations? Didn&rsquo;t Jimmy 
Carter call affirmative action &#8220;compensatory discrimination&#8221; back in 
1975? Wasn&rsquo;t that what quotas were all about? Didn&rsquo;t we have this 
conversation almost forty years ago? </p>
        <p> Reparationists suffer from convenient historical myopia. Compare these words of Lyndon Johnson in 1964  &hellip; </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> &#8220;You do not take a person who has been hobbled by chains 
and liberate him, bring him to the starting line of a race and then say:
 &#8216;You are free to compete with all the others.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> &hellip; with these of Randall Robinson in 2000: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> &#8220;No nation can enslave a group of people for hundreds of 
years, set them free   &mdash;   bedraggled and penniless   &mdash;   pit them, without 
assistance, in a hostile environment against privileged victimizers, and
 then reasonably expect the gap between the heirs of the two groups to 
narrow.&#8221; </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Verbosity aside, Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s metaphor is the same. 
Affirmative action was to make blacks whole by restoring the position 
they should have had at life&rsquo;s starting line   &mdash;   just what reparations are
 supposed to do now. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Because quotas became the order of the day, blacks have 
largely gotten whatever compensation they might have been owed. Peter 
Brimelow, writing in <i>Forbes </i> on Feb. 15, 1993, estimated that by 
the early 1990s racial preferences cost $350 billion a year, and they 
have no doubt become more expensive with further entrenchment. Some 
portion of this cost is the sheer inefficiency of finding, training and 
tolerating the errors of inept blacks, but much income is transferred. 
For instance, there are more than one million blacks enrolled in 
American colleges, and to judge by data that have emerged from reverse 
discrimination cases at the University of Texas, the University of 
Michigan, and elsewhere, virtually all black students hold places that 
were denied to abler whites. In this way, the life prospects of whites 
forced to attend inferior institutions have been exchanged for those of 
the blacks admitted ahead of them (although one must adjust for the 
probable failure of blacks to exploit these opportunities as well as the
 abler whites would have). Giving a black a better job than any 
equally-qualified white could obtain has a similar effect. Reasonable 
assumptions about the value of a college degree and the relative value 
of degrees from more and less prestigious institutions suggest that 
quotas could be transferring as much as billions of dollars annually. 
There have been quotas for more than thirty years, so if estimates of 
the cost of affirmative action are correct, it has already accounted for
 a good chunk of any reparations that might be owed. </p>
        <p> Growing ruder still, one may also subtract from any debt the
 cost to whites of black crime. Blacks commit about two thirds of all 
robberies in the US   &mdash;   half of which, or about 300,000 at current rates   &mdash;  
 victimize whites (white-on-black crime is rare). These crimes give 
blacks resources properly belonging to whites. Blacks commit felonies of
 all kinds at three to ten times the white rate, and even when their 
victims are not white, their crimes are a burden that would be 
considerably lighter in an all-white society. </p>
        <p> Public relief or &#8220;welfare&#8221; can be seen in the same light. 
Blacks fall below the threshold that triggers it three to four times 
more often than whites. White taxpayers therefore give blacks tens of 
billions of dollars every year; in my book <i>Why Race Matters</i> I 
note that black slums receive a &#8220;Marshal Plan&#8221; about once every three 
years, a rate that every few decades amounts to another trillion 
dollars. For reasons explained below, however, the case for counting 
this expenditure as paying off &#8220;debt&#8221; is more complex than I earlier 
thought. </p>
        <p> First, though, we should deal with a bad reason for arguing 
that welfare and robbery are not forms of redress, namely that they were
 never intended as such. This is true, but insofar as they shrink the 
gap between whatever blacks presumably deserve and what they actually 
have, they tend to balance the scales of justice. Suppose I smash your 
Ming vase. Soon after, but out of generosity rather than a desire to 
make you whole, I give you an equally valuable Ming vase for your 
birthday. Surely you could not demand another one, on the grounds that I
 still hadn&rsquo;t paid for the one I broke. This resolution of my debt may 
be emotionally unsatisfying, since the thought counts in personal 
relations, and you would like an admission of fault; nonetheless, I owe 
you nothing more. You are as you were at the outset, and I am relieved 
of any debt. </p>
        <p> There is a difficulty, however, in describing welfare as 
compensation. One might argue, for example, that once society decides 
(perhaps unwisely) that everyone deserves an education, and thereupon 
creates public schools, education ceases to be a gift to those who could
 not otherwise afford it. Given a right to education, American blacks 
deserve it independently of any debt or of the fact that they come from 
societies unable to provide public education. </p>
        <table class="boxright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2002/05/RUNAWAYsml.JPG" alt="" height="267" width="211" /> </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Likewise for welfare: By promising (perhaps unwisely) to 
help any citizen in danger of starving, our largely white society 
obligates itself to help blacks disproportionately if disproportionately
 more blacks need help. On the other hand, white society is certainly 
not obliged to create a legal right to welfare for anybody so the 
creation of universal legal welfare entitlements may still be thought of
 as indirect debt-canceling gifts to blacks. And whatever the rights of 
the case, reparationists should have the decency to acknowledge the 
great luck of American blacks to be living among inventive, productive 
whites. At the least, it is incumbent on reparationists to make the case
 that welfare <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a counterweight to slavery, and this they have never done. </p>
        <p> Although rude, these reminders of the obscurity of who did 
what to whom, the difference between good luck and compensatory 
liability, and the flow of wealth from whites to blacks   &mdash;   even the fact 
that today&rsquo;s blacks wouldn&rsquo;t exist but for slavery, a fact somebody is 
sure to find &#8220;insensitive&#8221;   &mdash;   are likely to fall on deaf ears. 
Reparations, as noted, cover the same ground as quotas and racial 
preferences, and none of the arguments so far raised, apt though they 
were and remain, has had the appropriate impact. Why? Because they seem 
mere quibbles in the face of stark, overwhelming race difference in 
wealth. Blacks here and in Africa are so thoroughly behind whites 
anywhere that there must be a reason, and what can that reason be but 
white theft? So many people find this inference obvious   &mdash;   or say they do
   &mdash;   that the <i>fact</i> of white guilt usually goes without saying. And 
once white guilt is assumed, the only open question is how whites should
 expunge it   &mdash;   via quotas, monetary payments or both. </p>
        <p> <b>The Essential Question of IQ</b> </p>
        <p> The issue of black poverty must be faced squarely, for given
 whites&rsquo; strong sense of duty, no subtleties about fault or 
responsibility will save whites from themselves if they believe 
themselves to be in the wrong. Hence the need to shock, by bringing up 
the race differences that were likewise verboten in the quota debate. We
 must make it clear that blacks are known to be on average less 
intelligent than whites, and that this almost certainly explains why 
they are on average poorer. As Richard Lynn has recently documented in <i>IQ and The Wealth of Nations</i>,national
 wealth tracks national IQ just as individual wealth tracks individual 
IQ. There is no mystery here. Things people want sometimes occur 
naturally, but most wealth is created by transforming nature. The 
ability to transform nature requires insight into how it works, and a 
higher IQ affords greater insight. That is why whites&rsquo; higher IQs allow 
them to produce a greater quantity and variety of more desirable things.
 </p>
        <p> As all AR readers know, the evidence is now overwhelming 
that racial IQ differences are primarily genetic in origin. Even people 
who don&rsquo;t read AR have an uneasy sense of this. The key point is to 
bring this fact to bear on the reparations debate. This is why David 
Horowitz&rsquo;s celebrated anti-reparations ad, trenchant enough to rouse the
 left on campuses everywhere, did not go far enough because it failed to
 mention biological race differences. Reparationists will continue to 
wave the bloody shirt of poverty, presenting whites with a stark 
intellectual choice: Agree that black poverty is caused by white sin 
(and pay up), or find a better explanation. Biology is the better 
explanation, and whites must learn to deploy it without hesitation. </p>
        <p> That whites will do anything to deny home truths about race 
is not news. But I believe that a desire to avoid these same truths 
about race difference also plays an important but ill-understood role in
 the minds of reparationists themselves, who will be misunderstood if 
glibly dismissed as mere &#8220;racial racketeers.&#8221; </p>

        <p> I suspect reparationists and other racial partisans invert 
the order of injury and compensation so as to avoid accepting 
responsibility for their own failings. In the real world injury is the 
basis, the cause, of liability. B hurts A; as a consequence B owes A 
compensation. Now imagine long-suffering Jones in an ambiguous 
situation. He is not doing well. He is not sure why, but he fears the 
cause may be an intrinsic defect. In this state of mind he may try to 
shift the blame, and claim someone owes him reparations as evidence that
 he was harmed, and therefore not defective. He reasons: &#8220;I&rsquo;m owed 
compensation, so someone must have hurt me; my sorry state is someone 
else&rsquo;s fault, so I&rsquo;m OK.&#8221; I suggest this may be the mechanism behind the
 odd intensification of blacks demands in the face of constant white 
concessions. To avoid the unpleasant conclusion that there is something 
wrong with them, blacks keep convincing themselves their failures are 
someone else&rsquo;s fault; and to convince themselves their failures are 
someone else&rsquo;s fault, they convince themselves that someone owes them 
compensation for past wrongs. </p>
        <p> This is why concessions are never enough. If every racial 
claim were met and every grievance were satisfied, what excuse would 
black apologists have for the fact that blacks still did not do as was 
well as whites? Unpleasant conclusions about inferior abilities would be
 unavoidable. To allay this fearful possibility, racial apologists 
invent ever-new grievances, ever-new unmet claims, whose existence 
proves that the plight of blacks is due to the wickedness of others and 
cannot be due to internal defects. </p>
        <p> This is why the facts about race and IQ <i>must</i> be part 
of the reparations debate. Until whites are prepared to make tough 
arguments about IQ, they will not fully convince either themselves or 
the reparationists that blacks have no claim on them. Ironically, an 
open airing of the IQ question would be an essential part of any 
decision to <i>pay</i> reparations, because no level of payments will 
eliminate black/white differences in outcomes. Even if whites handed 
over trillions of dollars in the name of compensation, the mechanism I 
have described   &mdash;   the need to blame whites for black failure   &mdash;   would 
bring blacks back to the table with yet more unmet grievances and unpaid
 debts. This process will not end until enough people of both races 
recognize the biological basis for racial differences in achievement. </p>
        <p> The demand for reparations is only the latest hedge. 
Opposition to it will be ineffective unless it takes into account the 
powerful symbolic and rationalizing purpose of all black demands on 
white society. </p>

              <p> <span class="dropcap2">B</span>lacks have thought of a
 new approach to reparations, and are suing companies that did not even 
own slaves but may have profited in some way from the existence of 
slavery. In March, black activist Deadria Farmer-Paellmann brought a 
class action suit in a Brooklyn federal court naming three defendants   &mdash;   
Aetna Inc., CSX Corp. and FleetBoston Financial   &mdash;   and promises to go 
after many more in the future. </p>

              </tbody></table>
              <p> Miss Farmer-Paellmann charges that one of the 
predecessor companies of Aetna, the largest insurer in the country, 
wrote policies on slaves against accidental death, just as it wrote 
policies on freemen. She says the profits from this business were 
immoral, and the successor company must pay punitive damages. The claims
 against the other companies are similar. FleetBoston is the successor 
to Providence Bank, founded by a Rhode Island businessman who reportedly
 trafficked in slaves. Providence Bank financed the slave-trading 
business and presumably profited from it. CSX, a railroad conglomerate 
that was established in 1980, had a predecessor company that reportedly 
used slaves to help build and perhaps run one of its rail lines. The 
company itself probably never owned slaves; it rented them from owners. </p>
              <p> Although all the companies say the alleged wrongs took
 place so long ago they cannot be settled in court, Aetna announced in 
early March that it was considering making a public apology for insuring
 slaves, and might make restitution payments from the profits. Of all 
the reparationist charges, those against Aetna would appear to be the 
most preposterous. Slave owners took out insurance policies on people 
and property they valued: houses, cargo ships, and loved ones. Aetna was
 doing business with owners who were unlikely to mistreat the property 
whose value they clearly recognized. </p>
              <p> If the three companies Miss Farmer-Paellmann has sued 
&#8220;profited from slavery,&#8221; it would probably be hard to find many that did
 not. Any company that manufactured anything used or consumed by slaves   &mdash;  
 clothes, tools, food, etc.   &mdash;   &#8220;profited from slavery.&#8221; Printers who 
printed handbills for slave auctions, companies that provided 
transportation for slaves, doctors who treated them, publishers that 
printed books about slaves   &mdash;   all are guilty of the crime that actually 
motivates these suits: the crime of being white.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" /> </p></td>

								<h2><a href="/ar/2002/05/index.html#article1">Reparations and the Law</a></h2>
						<p><i>Stephen Kershnar, American Renaissance, May 2002</i></p>
         <span class="dropcap"></span><span class="dropcap">C</span>laims for reparations raise 
several legal issues. Given that slavery ended in 1865, there is some 
question as to whether such claims are allowed by the statute of 
limitations, which limits the period during which a suit may be brought.
 In New York, where activists recently filed a class-action suit against
 companies that allegedly profited from slavery, the statute of 
limitations depends on the type of suit. In this case, the plaintiffs 
allege that the defendants&rsquo; predecessor companies misappropriated the 
value of slave labor and the profits that resulted from it. Any 
reparations suit is also likely to claim that forced labor, torture, 
rape, starvation, etc. were part of a system from which whites knowingly
 benefited. 
        <p> If a suit is for replevin (the return of personal property 
wrongfully taken) then New York has a three-year statute of limitations 
that begins when the owner demands that the property be returned. If a 
suit is for wrongful death the statute of limitations is generally two 
years from the date of death. If the suit is brought for an intentional 
tort, such as assault, battery, or false imprisonment, the statute of 
limitations is one year. The statute of limitations would appear to have
 expired on reparations claims of this kind, though a plaintiff may 
appeal for suspension of the statute, claiming that time was needed to 
research family or corporate records. </p>
        <table class="boxright">

            <td><img src="/ar/2002/05/FLIGHTsml.JPG" alt="" height="116" width="216" /> </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> As Prof. Levin has pointed out in the main article, today&rsquo;s 
blacks do not have standing to sue for compensation because they were 
not, themselves, harmed by slavery. A person has a compensatory-justice 
claim only if he has been unjustly harmed. The notion of harm involves a
 comparison of the claimant&rsquo;s condition in the actual world in which the
 injustice occurred, with what his condition would have been had the 
injustice not occurred. No such comparison can be made in the case of 
the descendants of slaves, because if there had never been slavery, the 
reproduction pattern among blacks would have been far different, and 
today&rsquo;s descendants would not exist. They can hardly claim to be harmed 
by slavery, since it caused them to exist. </p>
        <p> There is another obstacle to reparations suits, in that 
redress is sought not for slaves themselves but for descendants many 
generations removed. The descendants might claim to have inherited 
slaves&rsquo; claims to compensation, but claims do not automatically pass 
from one generation to another. They have to be recognized to exist, and
 must be formally passed on just like an uncollected debt. If slaves or 
their children thought they had a valid claim for compensation they 
could have sold it at a discount like a bond in default, donated it to 
the Baptist Church, or used it to pay rent. The current descendants have
 no substantiated claims in a legal sense, so inheritance is a weak 
basis on which to ask for compensation years later. In any case, while 
these inherited claims could conceivably give rise to a moral obligation
 to pay damages, it is doubtful they could be a legal obligation. This 
is why claims of this kind should be thrown out of court and handled   &mdash;   
if at all   &mdash;   in the political arena. </p>
        <p> These legal claims are likely to fail. They probably run 
afoul of statute-of-limitations requirements. More important, the 
descendents lack standing by which to bring suit since they were not 
harmed by slavery, and were probably not denied their inheritance. Their
 case ought to fare no better in the political arena, but given the 
widespread black support for reparations (55 percent support it 
according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll taken in February) and the 
importance of blacks to the Democratic Party, reparations proposals are 
likely to reappear in Congress and state legislatures.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" /> </p>

		<p>&#8220;One ever-handy yardstick that yields these remarkable figures are race differences in economic outcomes&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the difference between the average black in Africa as an indication of where they would have been, had slavery not intervened, and the average black in the US. Then let&rsquo;s multiply that difference by the years between to estimate the amount that blacks should pay whites for the opportunity given to them.</p>

		<p>If a slave cost $14,000 in today&rsquo;s money, that&rsquo;s further proof that very few white people owned slaves. If slavery was still legal, only a small number of people would be able to afford $14,000 to buy a slave, let alone the additional costs of housing and feeding the slave. The huge slave plantations must have been rare for that reason alone.</p>

		<p>You already paid your Blacks reparations for enslaving them by giving them Jesus Christ, civilizing them, teaching them agriculture, a now squandered work ethic, increasing their longevity with free health care, providing work for life, retirement care to the grave and a drug/alcohol-free environment. And that was just under Slavery. Then you taught them to read, sent them to school, taught them commerce, gave them food stamps and made them politicians, athletes &amp; entertainers. It&rsquo;s true</p>

		<p>Blacks are never satisfied.  They scream racism as a means to get more money and power from whites.  Plain and simple. &#8220;Reparations&#8221;  Excuse me, black people.  What do you call the billions that have been paid recently as &#8216;black farmers discrimination lawsuit&rsquo;?  What about the billions we&rsquo;ve wasted on Section 8, welfare, blacks suing the government with &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; claims, corporations forking over millions everytime someone screams racism, all the black on white crimes, etc?  </p>

		<p>The real problem with the reparations debate (problem for them, not us) is that it relies on a basic assumption that the US, not to mention the rest of the western world, has treated as the exact opposite, for the last several hundred years.</p>
<p>Are blacks, of us, or are they not of us.  Are they kith, kine and kindred, or are they strangers.</p>
<p>Think about this.  All welfare.  All rights.  Everything they have access to, relies on us assuming they are part of our society, and deserving of access to collective resources and a place and position in our lands.</p>
<p>However, the concept of being &#8220;owed&#8221; something by a people, has, as an a priori assumption being a separate people.</p>
<p>So which is it.  Are they Americans or are they Blacks.  If they are Blacks, perhaps they deserve their pound of flesh.  And along with it, a giant boot out of our lands to anywhere else but here.</p>

		<p>If we didn&rsquo;t agree to Mr. Levin&rsquo;s cultural-genetic analysis of debt as a financial matter but a purely racial one, we would be given vastly more respect on the tribalist scale of &#8220;You and what army?&#8221;.  Even by blacks.</p>
<p>That said, if blacks want a trillion dollars, give it to them.</p>
<p>Require that it be paid to _family_ groups of not less than 4 individuals.  And make it 10 million per group.</p>
<p>Then tell them that it is conditional upon their leaving this nation and never returning.  Ever.</p>
<p>Make sure that a line of whites is present, every day, at the international concourses at whatever airport is mandated as an exit point &#8216;to get your check&rsquo;.  And let them see the undisguised contempt we have for them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, go for a barter trade in &#8216;equivalencies&rsquo;.  We will give you the East Coast as a black homeland.  But you must consider all debts paid and you must take -every- black with you.</p>
<p>Again, never to return.</p>
<p>I would hurt, a lot, to lose the monuments in Washington D.C. and places like Boston and Philadelphia where so much of our history was made.</p>
<p>But it would be worth it.  And if you&rsquo;ve been to these &#8216;wonderfully enriched&rsquo; cities, it is a fait d&rsquo;accompli thing anyway.</p>
<p>Again, make sure there is a long line of white Americans to stare with utter contempt and hatred as they leave.</p>
<p>The real question would then come down to how we would compensate whites who had to leave their homes and jobs to give blacks their own place.</p>

		<p> If interstellar travel were possible; white people would make the ultimate white flight. After the civilization was established,all the hard work done and there was a thriving white human civilization on a different planet, blacks would demand their &#8220;fair share&#8221;.<br>
 I totally agree that if paid reperations, they should agree to leave and never return. Of course that would be racist.<br>
 With blacks you&rsquo;re wrong if you do; wrong if you don&rsquo;t and either way you go; you lose. Why bother trying anymore?</p>

		<p>I will agree to the very weak claim of reparations for the descendents of black slaves and former slaves&hellip;&hellip;on the same day that each one of the supporters of reparations agree to the much stronger claim of compensation to the descendents of former owners of slaves for their loss of lawful property.</p>
<p>The slaves were not unlawfully obtained and the human property was completely supported by the Federal Fugitive Slave Act. No law of the United States or any state prohibited the buying, selling, transporting, or act of ownership of said slaves, nor was any crime committed by the use of such slaves.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States forbids the taking of private property without due compensation AND that compensation has been delayed an average of one hundred and fifty years, which would indicate the usual interest and penalty for delayed payment would also apply.</p>
<p>No matter what is paid to the descendents of slaves and former slaves, the rights to compensation by the decendents of former slave owners is primary to the secondary claim of the former slaves. The claim of the former owners is against the United States Government, who deprived them of their lawful and legal property, and is not dependent on any correlary claim by the former slaves themselves, but since they (the black slaves) arrived in this country already as slaves, their claim would be against those who forced them into the state of slavery in their home countries of Africa and not against the United States Government. None of the former American slave owners enslaved any of their property, unless it can be shown otherwise, and therefore their payment for said slaves in an open market or auction was legal payment for property lawfully imported (and taxed) to the United States and consistent with the legal requirements in the individual states, which retain jurisdiction over these matters.</p>

<p>Any response to the Merry-Melodies-level-of-absurdity &#8220;reparations&#8221; nonsense should begin and end with this point:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reparations&#8221; for blacks is the idea that blacks should be <i>compensated</i> for the best thing to ever happen to them.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is brimming with blacks who wish they could share in black &#8220;America&rsquo;s&#8221; &#8220;misfortune.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since the slaves were provided with, and since everyone requires about the same quantity of necessities, the average inheritance of black children of sets of parents of legitimate family units and then divided by the number of bastards of their kind would be more realistic for example reparation for each black person than would wages not recieived plus interest.</p>

Blaxs took the seperate seating too personally (&#8220;because of what color I am&#8221;) and instead of wanting to be around their own, they seem to prefer the company of whites. I wonder why, would they not want to be among their own kind? Or was the complaining about how seperate seating made it harder to steal things from whites or pick pockets? Anyhow, we owe them no reparations they already have AA preference in welfare, college, and jobs. Enough already!</p>
