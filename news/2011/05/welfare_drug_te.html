			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jodie Tillman, Miami Herald, May 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A measure requiring the tests passed the [Florida] Senate on Thursday and is headed to Gov. Rick Scott, who called it one of his legislative priorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scott already signed an executive order requiring random drug testing of state workers.</p>
<p>HB 353 requires all adult recipients of federal cash benefits  &mdash;  the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program  &mdash;  to pay for the tests, which are typically around $35. The screen would be for all controlled substances and applicants would have to disclose any legal prescriptions.</p>
<p>Recipients who test positive for drugs would lose their benefits for a year. If they fail a second time, they lose the benefits for three years. Parents who test positive must designate another adult to receive benefits on behalf of their children.</p>
<p>Those who pass would be reimbursed by having their benefits increased by the cost of the test.</p>

		<p>I like the general trend of this legislation (welfare fuels the illicit drug industry), but it won&rsquo;t do any good.  The reason is that it only applies to TANF recipients (the time limited replacement for AFDC in the 1996 Welfare Reform), and the ghetto crowd has largely shifted from TANF to SSI, which no state can control in any way, because it&rsquo;s part of Federal Social Security.  As a matter of fact, being &#8220;drug addicted&#8221; as a result of a forced test to receive TANF would probably be grounds for &#8220;disability&#8221; for such people to get SSI.</p>

		<p>Who put the handouts in the budget in the first place? Shouldn&rsquo;t welfare be paid work?  We wouldn&rsquo;t need illegals if the govt. didn&rsquo;t give our money away to blacks. Oh, wait, politicians give our money to the blacks and the blacks vote for them. Makes sense.  Now they encourage the illegals to come and &#8220;help revive America&#8221;.  Then, when so many illegals are here that they can strike in mass and shut EVERYTHING down until we give them amnesty and the vote, the pols will &#8220;lead us to do the right thing&#8221; and give our America away to the Mexicans.</p>
<p>Then they can go on welfare too, and we will be White slaves to the black-brown coalition of power.  Will we know how to hold those Whitey pols accountable? Will we just accept it all as &#8220;the right side of history&#8221;?  Haven&rsquo;t enough Whiteys done that already with integration and civil rights that we have no hope of meaningful resistance?</p>
<p>Any answers? Any solutions?  Remember, those in control pay the police to enforce their edicts.</p>

		<p>This will be declared unconstitutional, guaranteed.  The diversity mongers would never let us cut off their income redistribution scheme to this degree.  Liberals and their pet judges are well aware that an uncomfortably large percentage of welfare moms use illegal drugs and have no self control.</p>

		<p>Oh, puleeze! Welfare is so 1970s with all those pesky social workers coming around. Today&rsquo;s modern tax dollar consumer is a lot more hip. They have entitlements. Many have &#8220;disabilities&#8221; like being bipolar. There is housing assistance like Section 8 and Food Stamps (whatever the sins of the parents are we going to starve their multiple children?) And as to the children, parents are getting hip to the idea of having the children diagnosed as having some disability- I think over $600 per month per child. Five kids can add up to some money. Then we have Earned Income Tax Credit. All sorts of entitlements that cannot, in my understanding, be drug tested for. I like Gov. Scott, but he has a rough road ahead of him on this one. I wish him good luck. </p>

		<p>This law will quickly be overturned by the Judiciary on the grounds of its &#8216;adverse impact&#8221; on blacks.  The suit against the law will be filed by the usual suspects, ACLU/NOW/ADL/AJC/SPLC etc.  The NAACP won&rsquo;t even bother as it has so many rich and skillful White allies.</p>
<p>Blacks flunk a civil service test?  Abolish it!  Blacks can&rsquo;t get into college?  Let them in even if they can&rsquo;t read!</p>
<p>Whatever blacks want the Judiciary gives them, including permission to murder, rape and pillage Whites and to destroy entire cities.</p>

		<p>This law will be in court the day it is passed. It will be an attack on &#8220;Black Culture&#8221; and blacks chosen lifestyle. Forcing welfare recipients to pay for a drug test will be a violation of their rights against self-incrimination. The other main problem will be not offering treatment to welfare drug addicts. Nice try Florida, I hope it will stand up in court, but it is doubtful.</p>

		<p>This is one of those laws that has good intent behind it, but will fail in the implementation. <br>
First of all it will be administered by the government with all the ways the government usually screws up everything.<br>
Second, the workers involved in every aspect of testing and tracking, enforcement and recording, even if personally honest, will be under intense pressure from their own families and others to alter the results so they can keep getting their checks.<br>
Third, food stamps and the other subsidies are supposed to be for the children. Children don&rsquo;t quit eating for a month just because mama smoked a blunt and it showed up on the test. The idea of sending the check to an alternate person is totally impossible in many cases, leading to a bureaucratic nightmare of Orwellian proportions. </p>

		<p>I think David Duke tried to pass this type of law in Louisiana when he was in the legislature.  It was considered a pretty radical, and of course racist idea back then.  As others have mentioned, the likelihood of of it not getting overturned by the courts is pretty slim. </p>

		<p>EVEN IF they fail, they can still designate another to get he same benefits for their children.  There is no savings here, people. Read the entire article before rushing to a conclusion. yikes people are simple these days.<br>
For failures, oops, I mean people who fail the drugs test, they will assign a buddy to get the cash, who will likely - yes, this may be reality for SOME- they will likely take a percentage- or steal it, in order to be the middle man.<br>
Again, no savings. They will just scream for more money and the liberal nazis that run this country will pay them- with OUR checkbook.<br>
After a year of working with the handicapped, I know that the disabled can get as much as $3,000 PER MONTH from the government. Remember, they&rsquo;re doing all they can to destroy us and this once great country from the top down and the bottom up. Guess who&rsquo;s going to get caught in the middle ? again.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct!  I know, I used to work where I saw this happen all the time. Also these drug mommies (mainly black or brown) get arrested for some crime and their children get taken for a little while by social workers, given to &#8220;grandma&#8221; or &#8220;auntie&#8221; who makes a killing off the money she now gets, then mama gets out of jail, and lives with grandma and the kids (because she is still &#8220;addicted&#8221;, then gets pregnant AGAIN) and they get ten times the money that welfare alone pays. Foster Care for these kids pays a heck of a lot more. They have all figured this out to beat the system. If that doesn&rsquo;t work for long then they go sign up for SSI for all those kids!  Try getting SSI if you are a WHITE adult and really cannot work any longer!</p>
<p>Have you been in a social security office in the last 20 to 30 years? NOTHING but NONwhites! Many cannot even speak English, of course. I feel sorry for the few ELDERLY Whites who have to sit and wait in that office among all those foreigners.</p>

		<p>Gee, they sure make people who WORK take drug tests, don&rsquo;t they? But not welfare queens? </p>
<p> We all know why that is. Whites work and pay the taxes. Blacks, etc. DO NOT work and get welfare so we cannot test them because that would be discrimination. Right?</p>

Parents who test positive must designate another adult to receive benefits on behalf of their children.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Just another built in corruption metric, guaranteed to put TANF/AFDC credit cards in the wrong hands for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>If you are that worried about the children, force the parent to be sterilized to get the benefit and when-not-if they fail the drug test (which should be forced, every 2-3 months, at the payees expense) strip their parental custody and reestablish state orphanages to put the little wonders into.<br>

		<p>Correct, these programs should have never been started to begin with; and the supposed &#8220;conservatives&#8221; that agreed to these Marxist/Communist programs back in the 1970&rsquo;s, should have made it mandatory from the get-go. Unfortunately I also think this will be overturned; this will never stand. Welfare receipients being tested for illegal drugs, are you kidding me?! The ACLU will be ALL OVER this, guaranteed.</p>

		<p>This SSI has got to stop. Kudos to the first poster who hit the nail on the head. I work in the inner city and it&rsquo;s gotten to the point that I ask how much they receive in SSI because I just assume they have it and they mostly do. They have their kids diagnosed with ADHD and receive it. They receive it themselves for Depression and Bipolar Disorder-they just say that they are unable to work because of their &#8220;problems&#8221;. BTW they are just lazy and shiftless people who stay home and cause problems. </p>

		<p>As it has been pointed out, the Social Security System has been corrupted to the point where white people almost automatically are discriminated against in obtaining a fair share of the system.  Increasing numbers of blacks and other minorities as SS workers will see to that.  I have a close friend who worked for me in an agency before she transferred to SS.  In six months she was looking to return to her old position since she had to work with almost all black workers and clients.  Many were high- both workers and clients and she was frightened to leave work and walk in the parking lot to her car.  While there she was horrified at the shenanigans, stories that would make you wretch.  Now Gov. Scott is a courageous man who will try to stop the deepening debt in Florida due to welfare issues but once the numbers of electorate tip the scales towards payout the conservatives will be run out of office.  And this is happening as we speak.  One just needs to look to the banana republic of South Florida where english is no longer spoken.</p>

<p>I agree completely with your post. &#8220;Bi-polar&#8221; and ADHD are two of the biggest scams out there for claiming &#8220;disability&#8221; and blacks have it down to a science. I worked with several black males and they were all lazy and couldn&rsquo;t care less about their jobs. They eventually all did the &#8220;disability&#8221; thing too. </p>
