<h1>Racism to Blame for Obama&rsquo;s Problems, Key Democrat Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Rosen, McClatchy Newspapers, May 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>House Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, on Wednesday blamed most of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s political problems on racism. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I&rsquo;m 70 years old,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I can tell you; people don&rsquo;t like to deal with it, but the fact of the matter is, the president&rsquo;s problems are in large measure because of the color of his skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clyburn noted that he himself got hate mail, racist phone calls and offensive faxes on a regular basis. Asked how that relates to the president, Clyburn retorted: &#8220;We have the same skin color; that&rsquo;s how it relates to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clyburn described a recent racist image of Obama that received widespread news coverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he sees his face being put on a chimpanzee&rsquo;s body; do you think he didn&rsquo;t see that?&#8221; Clyburn said. &#8220;And I suspect they send the same faxes to his office they send to mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Clyburn suggested that the &#8220;birther&#8221; movement of Americans who say Obama wasn&rsquo;t born in the United States is fueled by racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know why anybody didn&rsquo;t ask for John McCain&rsquo;s&#8221; birth certificate, Clyburn said. {snip}<br>

		<p> Blacks will continue to play the race card until they see that it isn&rsquo;t working any more. Clyburn&rsquo;s comments won&rsquo;t be treated with the scorn they deserve except on this website and a few other race realist blogs.</p>
<p> Of course most blacks will agree with Clyburn because as usual it gives them a perfect &#8220;out&#8221;: &#8220;We failed because of White racism.&#8221; But all too many liberal, self-delusional Whites will nod their heads sagely (they think) and say, &#8220;You know, he&rsquo;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p> We Caucasians need to start working toward re-establishing some racial solidarity. It won&rsquo;t be easy, but our survival is at stake.</p>

		<p>This is Jim Clyburn.  He thinks racism is to blame for everything.  Ordinarily, I wouldn&rsquo;t feed the troll, but a few things need to be pointed out.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;When he sees his face being put on a chimpanzee&rsquo;s body; do you think he didn&rsquo;t see that?</i></p>
<p>Answer:  <a href="https://goo.gl/JnoUb" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/JnoUb</a></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why anybody didn&rsquo;t ask for John McCain&rsquo;s&rdquo; birth certificate, Clyburn said.</i></p>
<p>Actually there was a bit of a &#8220;birther&#8221; controversy around McCain, too, because he was born on an American military base in Panama.  The issue of the definition of &#8220;natural born citizen&#8221; has never really been pushed, but I suspect that the Federal courts would in no way tell a man with two American parents born on an American military base, his father and grandfather, both having the same name as himself, both being four-star Naval admirals, that he&rsquo;s not a &#8220;natural born citizen.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;president&rsquo;s problems are in large measure because of the color of his skin.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Obama is the first person republicans have ever opposed.</p>
<p>Back to reality, I would suggest the president&rsquo;s problems are due to him not being a superb choice for that office.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why anybody didn&rsquo;t ask for John McCain&rsquo;s&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>It might have been because there is a clear idea of where McCain was born. Newpapers have reported Kenya as Obama&rsquo;s birthplace before this became important.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;When he sees his face being put on a chimpanzee&rsquo;s body; do you think he didn&rsquo;t see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s ok to do it to George Bush, right? The one you guys call Chimpy McBushHitler, that&rsquo;s not racist, is it? It&rsquo;s only racist to criticize your team.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like his policies that is for sure. He is a FAR lefty.</p>
<p>I also do not like nor want a man with his &#8220;skin color&#8221; (RACE) as POTUS. Racist? So what? I could care less about that word. No nonwhite should ever be in government positions In America to begin with. Remember blacks were not allowed on juries before either and now we can surely see why that was. The same for those in government.</p>

		<p>These articles are great for our cause! Relatively few Americans - White Americans in particular - still buy into this clap-trap about &#8220;racism&#8221; being the reason for every black failure, every negative opinion of a black, and indeed, every disagreement with a black(s). This just makes blacks look whiney and weak - always playing the perpetual victim role to the hilt&hellip;most people have had enough of it.   </p>

House Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, on Wednesday blamed most of President Barack Obama&rsquo;s political problems on racism. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t make him an expert on racism, the position of president or the native opinions of those he doesn&rsquo;t know among the millions of the rest of us.  What, were his faxes signed and investigated by the Secret Service?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&#8220;You know, I&rsquo;m 70 years old,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I can tell you; people don&rsquo;t like to deal with it, but the fact of the matter is, the president&rsquo;s problems are in large measure because of the color of his skin.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Being old doesn&rsquo;t make you wise sir.  It makes you stuck in your Civil Rights Era ways, trying to live on the spent inertia of something that wasn&rsquo;t wrong to begin with.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not interested in your claptrap excuses for why WE&rsquo;RE &#8216;racist&rsquo;.  How about-</p>
<p>1.  An Economic Stimulus that wasn&rsquo;t anything but a handout <br>
    system for low-run minorities and which has succeeded in <br>
    furthering undermining nations teeterin debt rating.<br>
2.  Failure to extricate us from rebuilding a muslim society <br>
    that is not ours to save.<br>
3.  Appointments to SCOTUS that have everything to do with <br>
    ethnic prestige and nothing to do with proven judicial <br>
    opinions or written papers?<br>
4.  Bailing out companies that didn&rsquo;t deserve to be and failing <br>
    to deal _specifically_ with the massive issue of black <br>
    largesse in the housing and loans fields?<br>
5.  No comment on the outright idiocy and utter corruption of <br>
    such major CBC members as Maxine Waters and CB Rangel. <br>
6.  No action whatsoever to close our southern borders and <br>
    secure the state from &#8216;threats both domestic and abroad&rsquo;.<br>
7.  Jumping to conclusions over Professor Louis Gates rather <br>
    than taking an unbiased position or better yet _letting the <br>
    local cops do their jobs_.<br>
8.  Screwing up KORUS.<br>
9.  Bowing to the King of Saudi Arabia.  Or for that matter <br>
    _any_ King.<br>
10. An utter failure to hold BP at financial risk for their <br>
    poor management of the gulf oil problem.  And then signing <br>
    legislation which closed down off shore drilling.<br>
11. Doing everything you can to sabotage and undermine this <br>
    nations&rsquo; military preparedness and specifically it&rsquo;s <br>
    development and acquisition process.  Wrong ships, planes, <br>
    tanks.  Wrong manpower fraction to run them.  Wrong <br>
    attitudes about gays serving.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Clyburn noted that he himself got hate mail, racist phone calls and offensive faxes on a regular basis. Asked how that relates to the president, Clyburn retorted: &ldquo;We have the same skin color; that&rsquo;s how it relates to him.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>You sir are a public official, that means your image gets the scorn as well as the laudates of anyone in the spotlight.  Grow a thicker skin.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Clyburn described a recent racist image of Obama that received widespread news coverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he sees his face being put on a chimpanzee&rsquo;s body; do you think he didn&rsquo;t see that?&rdquo; Clyburn said. &ldquo;And I suspect they send the same faxes to his office they send to mine.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Care to talk about the article that went with the image?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Clyburn suggested that the &ldquo;birther&rdquo; movement of Americans who say Obama wasn&rsquo;t born in the United States is fueled by racism.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t promise to have the most open administration &#8216;evuh&rsquo; and then hold back something which should have been a slam dunk and onto business _easy reveal_.  Also don&rsquo;t CONTINUE to withhold the college transcripts and papers by which we can judge your intelligence and philosophies of goverment.  In other words: you too are in the spotlight Mr. Obama.  Stay clean breasted and we will have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why anybody didn&rsquo;t ask for John McCain&rsquo;s&rdquo; birth certificate, Clyburn said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Because he wouldn&rsquo;t have refused to provide it and the MSM were too busy brown-nosing to provide anything like a realistic CV/resume of ALL Presidential Candidates.  Any other dumb questions sir?</p>
<p>Let it be said: John McCain would have been little better, IMO.  But I will never vote for a black when they have so much standing against them, racially.  And Mr. Obama has done _nothing_ to improve my opinion.</p>

<p>Precisely, Congressman.  &#8220;Racism&#8221; is key. How&rsquo;d you guess?</p>
<p>Recall when George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, Reagan, Carter, et al were President, there was never any opposition towards a single one of their policies from anyone  &mdash;  -not even the opposing parties.  No, instead there was not only a uniformity and unanimity, but there was a national cohesiveness, without a dissenting voice to be heard in all the halls of Congress. Before Obama, not a single President had ever once been caricatured by anyone, especially not the press.    </p>
<p>When Obama became President, for the first time in US history  &mdash;  -never before, mind you,  &mdash;  -all of a sudden there was opposition, debate, and political discord.  Caricatures are now envogue.  Again, this is a uniquely 21st century phenomena to be studied and remedied at the cost of (mainly white) taxpayers, of course.</p>
<p>Perhaps, Congressman, Obama naively thought he could achieve even greater unity, because being biracial (he is half-white, too  &mdash;  -don&rsquo;t forget that), he could navigate between and unify not only politicians, but also the &#8220;masses&#8221;.  Alas, to no avail.</p>
<p>The ONLY possible explanation for this is &#8220;racism&#8221;.  You are a genius for figuring that out, Congressman.  Really, you are:  Because &#8220;racism&#8221; is an accusation rarely made by black congressmen, much less the black population.  And when it is made, to argue against it, only proves the point at hand.  Circular reasoning, yes, I admit, but this is racial politics: who can be bothered with logic, common sense and fairness?</p>
<p>We should be taxed even more to reward your perspicacity and unique insight as also all the other Congressmen (and women) who agree with you.  </p>
<p>Of course, to oppose this would be &#8220;racist&#8221;, too, so it might be an uphill battle.  On second thought, maybe not, since most Congressmen are white.  And afterall, it is money.  </p>
<p>Those &#8220;racist&#8221; whites are always looking to thwart our Messiah!</p>

		<p>Clyburn gets &#8220;hate mail, racist phone calls and offensive faxes on a regular basis.&#8221; Really? Who sends faxes any more?  I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s lying, but&hellip;he&rsquo;s lying.  The respectable media will never, never never call him out on this because (as the original news story said) he spent a night in jail in 1960.</p>
<p>Remember too that Jim Clyburn tried to reenact Selma during the enactment of Obamacare. He sees racism everywhere because he is a race man.</p>
<p>Oh, and his kinship with Obama is literally skin deep. Ironic that this came out while Obama was in Ireland searching for the missing apostrophe in his last name. Soothing that Jim Clyburn could never do. </p>

<p>Very true. Those with his skin color more often than not have bad judgement, a lack of self control, a propensity for violence and racist, self-promoting views along with the belief that the gubment owes his kind (and his kind only) a guaranteed handout their entire lives. That view tends to result in problems.</p>

<p> That along with the The Defense Authorization Act or H.R. 1540, aka The Forever War Act of 2012, was overwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives earlier today on a vote of 322 to 96. This bill is going to be used to IMPRISON us White so-called &#8220;terrorists&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Anonymous Number 8 poster you made one entirely incorrect comment. Obama like all Democrats is very pro-military. </p>
<p>That Big Neoconman Lie of Democrats being anti-military intervention goes back to Carter and Reagan&rsquo;s lies about the Soviets being ten feet tall. JFK did the same in 1960 with the phony missile gap. Nor is Obama a Muslim as other posters here have asserted.</p>

		<p>The President&rsquo;s problem is not the color of his skin but the<br>
troubling indication that the President  &mdash;  whatever his pigmentation  &mdash;  is, in fact, only skin deep and very enthusiastically so.  His posturings suggest he feels that he is<br>
whatever he can seem to be ?  His efforts to portray himself as<br>
a &#8220;take charge&#8221; Leader in the endless PR exploitation of the Osama<br>
finale, and more recently in the boomerang effort to dictate that<br>
the 1967 boundaries would be the parameters for a Middle East<br>
peace  &mdash;  these efforts may serve to suggest that folks back off from him not because of his skin hue but because he probably wouldn&rsquo;t<br>
last three months as a used car salesman.  </p>

		<p>Democrats call people &#8220;racist&#8221; for the same reasons that four year olds call each other &#8220;pootyhead.&#8221;  Whenever they don&rsquo;t get their way, better watch out&hellip; You&rsquo;re a &#8220;racist!&#8221;.</p>

<p><i>Anonymous Number 8 poster you made one entirely incorrect comment. Obama like all Democrats is very pro-military.</i></p>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out.  0bama IS pro-military, as were all other Democrats before him, and has indeed expanded the useless, treasury-busting wars in the Middle East and beyond.</p>
<p>Reminds me of when Clinton was elected and (as Rush tell it):</p>
<p><i>Remember at the weeklong festivities prior to Bill Clinton&rsquo;s inauguration they were practicing flybys with US military jets and Ron Silver got mad, &#8216;What the hell are those jets doing here at our inauguration?&rsquo; Somebody jabbed him and said, &#8216;Ron, those are our jets now.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>This is, of course, before Ron Silver became &#8220;Ron the Neo-Con&#8221; after 9/11   &mdash;   a Bush-supporting Neo-Con&hellip; just like old Rush himself!</p>

		<p>Sorry Jim Clyburn! That color of skin garbage is all used up and people with a brain just don&rsquo;t buy it anymore.  If America is as racist as you say then how did Obama get elected?  It must mean that he got elected by voter fraud, voter intimidation, total control of the news media, and George Soros&rsquo;s money.   </p>
