<h1>Activist Battles Kenyan Tradition of Rape &#8216;Beading&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David McKenzie, CNN, May 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>Intricate beaded necklaces are a symbol of the Kenyan nation. But to young Samburu girls, the necklaces are a symbol not of national pride, but something much darker, that can lead to rape, unwanted pregnancies  &mdash;  and even the deaths of newborns, according to activist Josephine Kulea and the Samburu tribe itself.</p>
<p>In &#8220;beading,&#8221; a close family relative will approach a girl&rsquo;s parents with red Samburu beads and place the necklace around the girl&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Effectively he has booked her,&#8221; says Kulea, a member of the Samburu herself. &#8220;It is like a (temporary) engagement, and he can then have sex with her.&#8221; Girls are also &#8220;beaded&#8221; as an early marriage promise by non-relatives.</p>
<p>Some girls who are &#8220;beaded&#8221; are no more than 6 years old. {snip}</p>
<p>Samburu culture dictates that girls be engaged to a relative, she says, and they are allowed to have sex with him. But &#8220;they are not allowed to get pregnant and there is no preventative measures,&#8221; she says. &#8220;At the end of the day, most girls get pregnant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and these (infants) end up dying or being killed or being given away.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reach adulthood, Samburu girls will marry outside of their village, but taboo dictates the girls will never be able to marry if they keep their babies resulting from beading.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Philip Lemantile, the father of 14-year-old Nasuto, says beading is aimed at stopping promiscuity among young girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our culture,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is part of us. And we have been practicing it, and we accept that these girls should be beaded, and sometimes the girls just get pregnant.&#8221;</p>

<p>And incest is supposedly so much better than promiscuity?  Why not worry about &#8220;promiscuity&#8221; among young men?  You can&rsquo;t have a promiscuous young woman without a promiscuous young man.</p>
<p><i>Samburu culture dictates that girls be engaged to a relative, she says, and they are allowed to have sex with him. But &ldquo;they are not allowed to get pregnant and there is no preventative measures,&rdquo; she says.</i></p>
<p>The implication from this is that the Samburu people still don&rsquo;t fully grok that sex causes pregnancy.</p>

		<p>This is on CNN.  It may or may not be true. Probably some grant hustler, non profit pimp, activist feminazi is trying for a grant and a $100,000 per year salary as executive director to deal with this.</p>
<p>She will also need a complete housing allowance, new car leased every year, cell phone, clothing allowance etc etc.</p>
<p>Her solution is probably to bring all these girls to the US and give them affirmative action jobs in the federal government.</p>

<p>From the nation that gave us Pres. Obama&rsquo;s sperm-donor Barack Senior, ladies and gentlemen! </p>
<p>The logic in this section is brain-damaged even by African standards: <br/>
 <br/>
<i>Samburu culture dictates that girls be engaged to a relative, she says, and they are allowed to have sex with him. But &#8220;they are not allowed to get pregnant and there is no preventative measures,&#8221;</i> <br/>
 <br/>
So: Kenyan girls MUST have sex   &mdash;   with a relative, yet   &mdash;   from a shockingly early age&hellip; </p>
<p>But must NOT use pregnancy prevention&hellip; </p>
<p>And yet must somehow NOT become pregnant. </p>
<p>Got that, everybody? </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This is our culture,&rdquo; he says.</i></p>
<p>Yes it is. That&rsquo;s why the entire world doesn&rsquo;t like you. </p>

<p>So now we have to be &#8220;good Americans&#8221; and bring all these girls and their customs here to try to &#8220;save&#8221; them, while they  continue their customs here and turn us even further down the road to destruction? That is what this is all about, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>
<p>Do these boo hoo stories try to instill even more White guilt (because we have it so good) and they know how stupid we are, we will become even bigger suckers of the world to further our own racial and national demise? Did not God set up boundries (borders) for us just for this reason alone?</p>
<p>Maybe someone needs to point that verse out to the Pope and other Christian leaders who are intent on mixing us all up.</p>

In other words, being sold as slaves.  Our forefathers were truly stupid men for bringing these people to our country as slaves.  They never bother to examine the process by which the slaves became available for sale and the implications of that.</p>
<p>Slavery, prior to the modern generation was basically a form of welfare&hellip;.at least in the white world.  One group would win a battle and kill off most of the men.  You had two choices as to what to do with the women and children.  Leave them to die slowly and horribly to starvation&hellip;.or worse, survive and breed a new generation of enemies.  Or put them to the sword.</p>
<p>Our ancestors invented a third option&hellip;..mercy.  The survivors were brought into society under controlled conditions and given second class citizen status.  If they proved themselves, they were absorbed, normalized and adopted&hellip;..intermarried with.  Enemies became family and mercy was rewarded with peace.  But this was only possible because whites, in general, are good.  Individuals who were not were given a swift hanging.  But the vast majority were good, decent people no matter the conditions.  It was an inherent trait.</p>
<p>Blacks are almost the inverse.  And slavery to them means something far different and sinister.  The cost of not realizing this difference has been enormous and threatens civilization itself.</p>

		<p>Poster # 7 is on to something.  Slavery is rampant in Africa.  Sounds very much like the old slave breeding programs the blacks used for producing slaves first to the Arabs and later to the Europeans. </p>
