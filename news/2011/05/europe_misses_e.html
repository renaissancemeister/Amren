			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), May 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The European Commission has apologised for printing more than three million school diaries containing no reference to Easter or Christmas.</p>
<p> The diaries  &mdash;  330,000 of which were delivered to UK schools  &mdash;  note Sikh, Hindu, Muslim and Chinese festivals, as well as highlighting &#8220;Europe Day&#8221; which falls on May 9.</p>
<p>But the lack of any acknowledgement of Easter, Christmas or any other Christian holiday angered church leaders and politicians.</p>
<p>Earlier this year a Commission official admitted the omission was a &#8220;blunder&#8221;.</p>
<p>But a formal complaint by an Irish priest prompted an inquiry by the EU Ombudsman into the 2010/2011 edition of the &#8220;Europa Diary&#8221;, issued to secondary schools every year by Brussels.</p>
<p>Today the Ombudsman, P Nikiforos Diamandouros, dismissed calls for the entire run to be recalled, saying the Commission&rsquo;s apology for the &#8220;regrettable&#8221; error, coupled with a one-page correction sent out to all schools showing the main public holidays in every EU member state, was sufficient.</p>
<p>An inquiry report today said: &#8220;In the Ombudsman&rsquo;s view, the actions which the Commission took to rectify the error were reasonable. He further considered that it would be disproportionate to reprint the 2010/2011 edition. Accordingly, the Ombudsman closed the case without further inquiries.&#8221;<br>

<p>When this scandal   &mdash;   for which the EUSSR is only NOW &#8220;apologizing   &mdash;   first broke several months back, I commented here on AmRen about it. What I said was, as a person with extensive experience in writing, editing, and proofreading, I can assure everyone that there is NO WAY that omitting BOTH the most important Christian holidays, while everyone else&rsquo;s holidays remain correct, would be possible without planning, without subterfuge. The odds against BOTH of these days being left out purely by accident   &mdash;   in a document otherwise correct   &mdash;   are so astronomical as to be impossible. </p>
<p>Before any print-run of THREE MILLION actually goes to press, many MANY eyes have to pass over it. Many, MANY individuals have to sign off on it. At least SOME of those lower-placed individuals MUST have noticed the &#8220;errors,&#8221; and duly alerted their superiors to the situation&hellip; to which their superiors MUST have replied, &#8220;Yes, we&rsquo;re aware of this, it&rsquo;s not a mistake, just don&rsquo;t worry about it.&#8221; </p>
<p>IOW, this deleting of the continent&rsquo;s founding religion could ONLY have been intentional. And this belated &#8220;apology&#8221; for the &#8220;blunder&#8221; is merely the next stage in the scheme. First they planned the &#8220;mistake&#8221;; then they scheduled the &#8220;apology.&#8221; </p>
<p>And the next stage after this? Who knows? Presumably, it&rsquo;s that future editions of this calendar will also be missing the Christian holidays&hellip; only in a few years&rsquo; time, they will be able to claim that leaving out Christmas and Easter &#8220;is a well-established tradition stretching back many years.&#8221; The EU elites will claim it &#8220;has always been this way,&#8221; in much the same way that the elites in Orwell&rsquo;s &#8220;1984&#8221; claim &#8220;Eurasia has always been at war with Eastasia&#8221;&hellip; even though many can remember when the opposite was true. </p>
<p>They are setting a precedent. Later, they will cite this precedent as justification. </p>
<p>This is worse than a &#8220;War on Christmas.&#8221; This is the godless EUSSR&rsquo;s &#8220;War on Christianity.&#8221; Attacking Christianity is merely another stage in the European Superstate&rsquo;s psy-ops campaign against Europe itself. </p>

<p>This is disgraceful! It proves that the EU is run by a bunch of self-hating  Marxists, and some others, all  hell-bent on destroying the old Europe, its culture, religion, nationalities and race   &mdash;  -  and that Brussels has become the new Moscow. Moscow has simply picked up and moved west.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this was a &#8220;mistake&#8221; at all. Has the person responsible been identified? That factoid  would be very interesting to know.</p>
<p>Myself,  I am not a practicing Christian, and really  no longer any kind of Christian at all.  But I don&rsquo;t hate Christianity either.  It is the religion that we came out of. Like it or not, even those of us who are not Christians were formed within that mold.  We cannot help being influenced by it.</p>
<p>In the interest of simple justice, it is obvious that if you list the holidays of some, you must list them all.</p>
<p>And no, I won&rsquo;t even say that you should list them equally. Why not?  Because they are NOT  equal.  Christianity is the historical religion of Europe and has been  for many centuries. You cannot equate it with Sikhism or Hinduism or  Islam, which are recent foreign intrusions, held by exotic  minorities, generally very tiny minorities. They simply are not the same as the religion which has formed  the cornerstone  and identifying mark of European culture for nearly two thousand years. </p>

<p>Therein lies the fault, if time of occupation is the only qualifier, then Islam, or any other religion only need put in time.  Many Muslims regard much of Spain as part of the Islamic world, and guess why - time of occupation.  In this way, it might be argued that Europe has long been a place where successive religions have swept over and occupied the geographical and then cultural landscape.  The wars concerned with settling the Christian occupation in Europe lasted at least a thousand years.</p>
<p>Christianity is 50% pre-Christian &#8220;paganism&#8221; (it&rsquo;s a mix of polytheism and patriarchal Judaism).  The New Testament is useful to any enemy as it disarms the host of resistance while seeking include through conversion - the world.  This puts it automatically at odds with Islam which seeks to do the same.  It may have assisted the various European empires in the past, but it is used against the West now. Perhaps more Euros will begin to understand that it was and is their earlier indigenous religions that justified their defense of their lands and people.</p>
<p>The Gothic Arches in all those cathedrals were designed to make it easier for the indigenous Europeans to be lured into the buildings, since they resembled the oak groves that their fathers had worshiped among and held sacred.  Once the &#8220;Christians&#8221; are forced to meet outdoors, under the cover of oak forests, due to the churches being closed or converted to mosques, perhaps then they will rediscover their real spiritual roots - and their true identity.</p>

		<p>So what is the specific reaction of the Catholic church?</p>
<p>While I am leery of letting any specific religion headline in a nation devoted to secular rule of law, what particularly disturbs me is the notion that these &#8216;politicians and church leaders&rsquo; have no biting retort or party policy as to what happens when the Islamists and Sikhs and and and take over.</p>
<p>Whatever the short term shock effect (driving people back to religion by denying it&rsquo;s validity?), you cannot exclude and ignore one religion on a constant basis while leaving others to be proselytized and supported, both privately and officially, and not begin to cause people to abandon hope in or even awareness of the issue as to which is the least harmful to it&rsquo;s social body.</p>
<p>Given the history that these secondary religions have, even in the post 1990 histories of the EU (crime, corruption, &#8216;cultural issues&rsquo;), why is it that nobody dares ask the key question:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by uplifting these barbaric cults?&#8221;</p>

<p>*****************************</p>
<p>Just as there are Jews who do not practice Judaism (or even believe in it), but who are still &#8220;culturally Jewish&#8221;,  I can see that there would  be non-practicing, or even un-believing, Christians who are still culturally Christian.  It is unavoidable if you grow up in a Christian society. How could a fish live in an ocean without getting wet?</p>

At least today&rsquo;s marxist are panty- waists, and should they EVER have the insanity to &#8220;Come Down&#8221;, it would be from their heroin or pot high. &#8216;Should they &#8220;Come Down&#8221; on a right- thinking white man, they&rsquo;d get crushed.<br>

		<p>Perhaps this was three or four years ago&hellip; TABCO (Teachers Association of Baltimore County) publilshed a calendar for its members with Christmas falling on the wrong date(if I recall, they had it on the 27th  &mdash;  not on the 25th). But, I blame it on stupidity, not mean-spiritedness. When I called to complain, the receptionist told me that very few calls about the &#8220;error&#8221; had come in. </p>

		<p>Is the Church of England becoming Islamic to Muslims? (Islam means subservient).<br>
 I agree it is just like in 1984 by George Orwell: you keep up the lie and people become afraid to disbelieve. Marxist$ are gradually phasing out Christian religious and cultural symbols so that they can make everyone forget about them because they really do believe the walrus-crap in the communist manifesto, and they want to be the number 1 party from &#8220;1984&#8221;.</p>
