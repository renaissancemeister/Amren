<h1>Obama to Use Political Capital From Osama&rsquo;s Killing to Push Amnesty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Tancredo, E-Blast, May 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the last few weeks, President Obama has been meeting behind closed doors to push for amnesty. On Tuesday, Obama met with the Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus and promised to promote amnesty.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of his &#8220;stakeholders&#8221; meeting to have a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; on immigration. The problem with this &#8220;dialogue&#8221; was that every single person he met with supported amnesty. The coalition included a number of sanctuary city mayors and police chiefs, CEOs of businesses convicted of hiring illegal aliens, far left George Soros funded groups like the Center for American Progress, and race hustlers like Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Obama celebrated Cinco De Mayo with a Hispanic movie stars like Eva Longoria and Rosario Dawson and told them we need to &#8220;fix this broken system,&#8221; which like &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; is another code word for amnesty.</p>
<p>Now today, the Whitehouse announced that the president will make a major immigration speech on Tuesday. According to Obama&rsquo;s press secretary Jay Carney, &#8220;What I can say is that the speech will reflect the President&rsquo;s continued commitment to find a bipartisan way to create comprehensive immigration reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to USA Today, the timing of the speech makes clear that &#8220;he will use his newly earned political capital [from killing Osama] to push his version of immigration reform, including potential citizenship for illegal immigrants who are already in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>This shows exactly where Obama&rsquo;s priorities are.</p>
<p>It will be very difficult for any amnesty to pass the Republican controlled House, but we cannot be complacent. The GOP establishment still responds to the cheap labor lobby, and it is us  &mdash;  the conservative grassroots of the party  &mdash;  to stand up against the open borders RINOs.</p>
<p>Bay and I are going to consult with leaders in Washington and across the country to stop Obama&rsquo;s latest amnesty scheme cold.</p>
<p>Keep the faith.</p>

		<p>The GOP establishment still responds to the cheap labor lobby</p>
<p>There is no &#8220;cheap labor lobby&#8221;.  It became quite clear, in the very earliest days of NAFTA that mexican labor is essentially worthless.  Where a white person might give you 10 hypothetical units of production, a mexican, working for half the cost, would only give you 1 or 2&hellip;..then start lumping in all sorts of costs as he interferes with the productivity of others.  An example.  Say you have ten guys on the production line, each with a specific task to do before sending a unit down the line.  Now imagine what would happen if, on any given day, only half the workers even bothered to show up.  Many were constantly being arrested for drug crimes.  Fights were common at work, with the occassional gunshot murder.</p>
<p>Does that sound like a situation conducive to profit via cheap labor?  Of course not.  That&rsquo;s ludicrous.  But it is the reality of hiring mexicans.  NOBODY in business who is out to make a profit hires anyone but white people.</p>
<p>Trouble is, large numbers of corporations are controlled by radical leftists who use their positions to seek &#8220;social justice&#8221;, not profit.  And they really don&rsquo;t care when the business goes belly up.  They are EMPLOYEES.  But employees who control the corporation as if they built and own it.  While they are there they leech the company for a fat salary as they cause as much damage as possible to &#8220;bring down the system&#8221;, then open a golden parachute when the company goes bankrupt and investor stock becomes worthless.  Not that these radical leftists I am talking about are republicans.</p>
<p>Very important to understand.  Why?  Because you can&rsquo;t negotiate with these people in terms of mutual best self interest.  They aren&rsquo;t in it for the money.</p>
<p>The republican &#8220;grass roots&#8221;, in other words, the part of the republican party that isn&rsquo;t communist, must understand that the basis of the corruption, betrayal and sabotage of the conservative agenda comes from anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-American sentiment.  Not greed.</p>

		<p>Not to be hysterical, but really, if Barry Soetoro does this he risks setting off a race war.</p>
<p>Even &#8220;on the fence&#8221; Whites understand that mass amnesty of 20-30 million mestizos means a permanent Democratic voting bloc and the permanent minority status of Whites, in their own nation.</p>
<p>BTW: &#8220;Path to the citizenship.&#8221;  There already IS a path to citizenship!  But the criminal mestizo fraudsters, forgers, sneaksters, and trespassers have violated this path to citizenship!  Paging Dr. Orwell&hellip;</p>
<p>Mass amnesty = anti-White</p>
<p>Mass amnesty = White genocide</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only in WHITE nations where everyone cries out for millions of non-Whites to flood the place.  That&rsquo;s a directed effort to get rid of the White race.  This is not a radical idea, and judging from Yahoo News comments, more people are picking up on the White genocide meme.</p>
<p>Myself, I thought it was a bit much until I thought about it.  Are there any non-White nations where they cry for more diversity (less White people)?  They want White genocide because a mongrelized brown population will be servile and never revolt or complain.</p>

		<p>Makes sense to me. Guess what drove me to suscribe to AMREN . It happened ten years ago when thanks to our open borders policy 3000 americans died. I so I guess the death of Osama Bin Laden has brought them all back.</p>

		<p>Just some years ago, Americans repelled the largest scale push for Amnesty since Reagen&rsquo;s success in the 80&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>It was a great, if restrained victory. In a time where our situation seemed hopeless, we came through and thwarted what would&rsquo;ve been the largest smack to the face of American citizens in all of Bush&rsquo;s 8 years of presidency. </p>
<p>Just some months ago the &#8216;DREAM&rsquo; Act, a smaller &#8216;foot in the door&rsquo; Amnesty made to pave the way for a broader Amnesty, nearly made its way into law; Barely shot down by the fury of grassroots whites, sick and tired of the government ignoring their calls for enforcement and deportation.</p>
<p>Now again the usual suspects are ramping up their artillery for another assault on the desires of the American people. Again we will find ourselves having to confront a destructive force hell bent on legalizing millions of law breakers. Many of which will bring and have brought nothing to this nation besides an excessive burden on our welfare state, a foreign culture creating division and alienation, and ofcourse, crime on our streets. </p>
<p>Like the Hydra of legend, it keeps coming back. We dice off its head, and another takes its place.</p>
<p>The old guard will no doubt rise to the challenge of again putting down this vile appeasement of invaders. But regardless of our success, or lack-thereof, we should note these onslaughts will only continue for as long as the enablers remain in power.</p>
<p>For as long as the beast can keep sprouting its heads. </p>

2  &mdash;  Anonymous simply does not want to acknowledge that white American employees are being pauperized by white American employers because of greed. <br>
 <br>
High placed corporate executives are not only employees, but major stock holders in their companies. They are often liberal on issues like gay marriage. They do not fly the American flag in front of their pricey homes. Nevertheless, on economic issues they are thoroughly right wing, and enthusiastically Republican. <br>
 <br>
If Mexican labor was as worthless as 2  &mdash;  Anonymous wants to believe the employer - investor class in the United States would not be lobbying Congress to ease restrictions on Mexican immigration. It would not be closing factories in the United States and moving production to Mexico.  <br>
 <br>
Calling those people &#8220;communist&#8221; is just plain silly. They are cold hearted capitalists. They would run their foreign built limousines over a dozen American flags to make a profit. </p>

By this I hope he means the broken border fence. There are ares of America that are dangerous &#8220;no go zones&#8221;. The Buenos Airs National Park in AZ is a drug smuggling pipeline into the US. Falcon Lake in TX is constantly in the news with gun battles and murdering American citizens. How has our government gotten so weak that we can&rsquo;t even control our borders? These are acts of war against America and anyone who condones this silent war is guilty of sedition and should be tried like a traitor. The only good thing to come from this is their covert war against America isn&rsquo;t so silent anymore. Remember this article and the 100&rsquo;s of others just like it come November 2012.</p>

		<p>Forget amnesty and Jimmy Obama&rsquo;s pandering to mestizos for votes. He already gets almost 70% of them now, including the illegals that vote. The republican house and the senators that need to pander to independents and whites to get re-elected won&rsquo;t be voting on amnesty any time soon. Jimmy Obama should look to spend his &#8220;political capital&#8221; on other things. I really don&rsquo;t think Jimmy O &#8220;killed&#8221; bin Laden. When a player hits a home run, he usually gets most of the credit, not the peanut vendor in the stands. Jimmy&rsquo;s going to need all the capital he&rsquo;s got, with unemployment at 9%, the trade deficit now at a record level, huge debt, ever increasing inflation, gas prices, Libya, etc. Detroit elected and re-elected black mayors that cut the population by more than half and sent the city into ruin. Looks like we&rsquo;re on the same path as a country. The whites moved out of Detroit. Where do we all move to after Jimmy Obama&rsquo;s done?</p>

<p>This is a very important point, and I&rsquo;m glad you brought it up.  Too many amerikan rightists are still clinging to the old mantra that &#8220;Democrats want open borders because mestizos vote Democratic, and Republicans want open borders because they want cheap labor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry folks, but it just ain&rsquo;t true any more  &mdash;  if it ever was.  The corporate establishment in this country is controlled by the same hard-left mentality as the liberals.  In fact, they <i>are</i> liberals.  Oh, sure, the corporate interests will support a few hand-picked &#8220;conservative&#8221; fiscal issues, when it&rsquo;s to their advantage.  But by and large, they&rsquo;re staffed by the same left-leaning diversicrats, grown up in the Sixties and educated in the Seventies, who run the Democratic party.</p>
<p>There simply <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> any Corporate Right any more.  It&rsquo;s time to break out of the &#8220;unlimited immigration is bad for economic reasons&#8221; trap into which so many of the racially-aware have fallen.  The corporations  &mdash;  and the Republican Party  &mdash;  could care less about how bad open borders are for the economy.</p>

I agree with you that the corporations and the Republican Party do not care about white American employees, but I wonder how you define &#8220;left-leaning.&#8221; I can guarantee you that those who own and run the United States are more influenced by the writings of Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand than Karl Marx. </p>

		<p>Obama is an open anti-White manipulator. Not a surprise here because his mother was a self-hating White revolutionary who associated and dated only Blacks and other non-Whites.</p>
<p>Come November 2012 this Obama will have to be thrown out of office by the voters and the next White President,a nationalist, will have to declare a state of emergency,stop forever all non-White immigration and begin a long deportation process of all those who have faked their way in here and those who pose a danger to the present and future existence of Whites.</p>
