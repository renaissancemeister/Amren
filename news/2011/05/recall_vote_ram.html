			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cindy Horswell, Houston Chronicle, May 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mood in this East Texas timber town [Cleveland, Texas] is tense as the City Council meets tonight to review the recall election that removes three black members in a community already simmering over 19 other black residents being charged with gang-raping an 11-year-old Hispanic girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people want to think this election was not based on race, but it is,&#8221; said Delores Terry, the only black member left on the six-member council who was not targeted for recall. &#8220;It wiped my heart out to see the cruel, ugly, nasty hate. I&rsquo;d never dealt with it before in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, a leader of the recall effort, Stan Jones, a dentist and former mayor, said he&rsquo;s tired of recall opponents playing the &#8220;race card&#8221; to camouflage their mismanagement as they &#8220;spent money like inebriated sailors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones&rsquo; group was forced to obtain an appellate court order to compel the council to call Saturday&rsquo;s recall election, as the four black members refused to recognize the 340-signature recall petition that they felt was racially motivated and possibly had forged signatures.</p>
<p>The fight grew so intense that the black mayor pro-tem, Barbara McIntyre, sent out cards urging supporters to mount a letter-writing campaign attacking the local newspaper for printing &#8220;half truths&#8221; and sent a letter asking the IRS to investigate the tax-exempt status of the First United Methodist Church, whose pastor had supported the recall.</p>
<p>In the prelude to the recall effort, the four black members had ignited a firestorm of controversy by banding together to fire longtime City Manager Philip Cook, whom they thought was unresponsive to their questions. This also led to the exodus of three key employees  &mdash;  the city&rsquo;s technology director, grant writer and finance director. The trio had been constantly peppered with questions that left them feeling that they, too, stood on shaky ground, Jones said.</p>
<p>The recall election drew more than 1,000 voters  &mdash;  twice as many as usual in this town of 8,000. </p>
<p>By the end of the night, McIntyre, a real estate agent and six-year incumbent; Durlene Davis, a retired clerk who had held office for five years; and Cedric McDuffie, a policeman and one-year incumbent, had been kicked off the council by about 58 percent of the voters.</p>
<p><b>Interim members</b></p>
<p>The black council members afterward gathered together, held hands and prayed. The three who were recalled declined any comment on the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ll be rejoicing in their wrongdoing when they come to see the big show (tonight&rsquo;s vote canvassing),&#8221; said Terry, a day care operator, who believes she was spared from the recall for appearances in order to keep &#8220;someone of color&#8221; on the council.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Taint of gang-rape case</b></p>
<p>The mayor said the recall had nothing to do with race: &#8220;It was just poor decision-making. The main thing started during the budget process. They did not understand the numbers given to them, and then there was the dismissal of the city manager without cause, which cost the city $45,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said it was unfortunate that the recall comes on the heels of the rape case that drew community activist Quanell X to their town months ago. Flanked by personal security guards, Quanell chastised the four black council members for being too afraid to attend a meeting in which he addressed the possibility of the town &#8220;losing an entire generation&#8221; of young black men when the 19 suspects in the rape case go to trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Three barred for 2 years</b></p>
<p>Kirkonis praised the recalled members for their &#8220;courage&#8221; in not feeling pressured into attending the meeting that attacked the city&rsquo;s police department.</p>
<p>As a council member, Terry said she cannot discuss the rape charges.</p>
<p>However, she believes the voters were &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; by Kirkonis and others, who objected to a black majority running their town. The mayor votes only in case of a tie.</p>

		<p>District voting for Stuporvisors in San Francisco really made things worse here, it started about 10 years ago,and it assured that the most left wing, communist Stuporvisors are elected.  And the reason why we have it is &hellip;&hellip; Willie Brown.</p>

		<p>There are two reasons why I would not want my town to be governed by a black majority:</p>
<p>1.  The high probability of even less competent or fiscally sound government that I get from the usual white pinhead politicians.</p>
<p>2.  The certainty that race will be dragged into <i>every<i> issue.<br>
</i></i></p>

		<p>*&ldquo;Some people want to think this election was not based on race, but it is,&rdquo; said Delores Terry,-</p>
<p>Of course its about race Delores, if it wasn&rsquo;t, why are you so upset?</p>
<p> *They did not understand the numbers given to them, and then there was the dismissal of the city manager without cause, which cost the city $45,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there was a &#8220;cause&#8221; for dismissing the city mamager - he\she was White and was on their trail.</p>
<p>*However, she believes the voters were &ldquo;brainwashed&rdquo; by Kirkonis and others, who objected to a black majority running their town-</p>
<p>No they were &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; by images of Detroit, Oakland, E. St Louis, Newark and everywhere else theres a black majority running things. THATS why they recalled the three black members that were spending money like &#8220;inebriated sailors&#8221;. If they weren&rsquo;t so obsessed with racial hatred against Whites they&rsquo;d understand that. Blacks must also object to a black majority running things because as soon as they can, they go to where Whites are running the show. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take the race card off the table entirely by halting all pretensions that blacks are as smart as everbody else when it isn&rsquo;t true at all.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s break it to them gently that their group I.Q. average of 85 disqualifies them for leadership positions, and that their propensities for crime and violence further disqualify them for much of anything else as well.</p>
<p>And somebody tell Quanell X that if blacks kill and rape people they&rsquo;re going to pay the price and, if sending them to the slammer is going to reduce the black male population in that city, it is a good thing, and tell him also he doesn&rsquo;t understand that because he&rsquo;s black and really can&rsquo;t understand much of anything anyway.  And somebody whisper in his ear that people think blacks lack intellect and are prone to crime and violence, because they are that way.</p>
<p>And, do I think that will help?  Of course not. They wouldn&rsquo;t understand a word of it.</p>

We have a black, former city councilman, Brian Davis, who resigned and is under indictment for sitting on boards of community projects for which he voted money to while on the city council and then he paid himself the money.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, he was arrested with his drug dealing half-brother in his half-brothers house with crack.  </p>
<p>When will racism end?</p>

Black congregations have always openly mingled politics with their preaching, yet get a free pass from the IRS. White congregations on the other hand are under tight scrutiny. </p>
<p>The USA that we remember is finished and if we&rsquo;re lucky, balkanization is out future. We have mishandled the issue of race in this country the minute after the last shot was fired during the revolution.</p>

<p>District voting in San Francisco was started to create special mini districts for the gays, feminazis and other marxists.  They were also created to save money since a district election is so much cheaper than a city wide one.</p>
<p>This meant that any marxist weirdo new comer could get elected for less money and with just a few votes.  That&rsquo;s why the Feds want district city council elections in Compton and even tiny little rural towns of 10,000 in California.</p>

&#8220;They did not understand the numbers given to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Blacks are handed everything from birth it is disinegnuous of us to expect them to understand numbers. We give them a free ride, we give them power, then expect them to behave responsibly.</p>
<p>This is the way every city will eventually die.</p>

		<p>Many communities lost entire generations of young men who serving in the same regiments were killed in battle, some for the lost cause and some for the prevailing cause.</p>
<p>I doubt Quanell X knows anything about real history, or would acknowledge any truth which didn&rsquo;t elevate his dismal philosophy, of black victimhood, black excuses for constant failures, and complete subjugation of the white race for blacks.</p>
<p>This is a blueprint for the entire country and it&rsquo;s in motion.</p>

<p>Actually, they are WORSE than &#8220;inebriated sailors.&#8221; Sailors only spend money they&rsquo;ve earned. If they spend it foolishly, it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s problem but their own. </p>
<p>But these black politicians were being reckless with OTHER PEOPLE&rsquo;S tax money   &mdash;   and therein lies all the difference in the world. </p>

		<p>Reduce black male population equals reduced crime.</p>
<p>The world over the statistics don&rsquo;t lie.  Crime has gone way done in Los Angeles since the hispanics moved into black areas and the blacks moved to the far flung suburbs.</p>

<p>Counterpoint would be most people probably think child rapists should just be executed. These 19 black rapists will probably all be out of jail before they are 30 and back out raping.</p>

		<p>This-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The recall election drew more than 1,000 voters &mdash; twice as many as usual in this town of 8,000. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Is the key issue.  Even if fully 40% of these people are underage or otherwise unable to get to a voting station, that only 1,000 voted is&hellip;illuminating.</p>
<p>Either this town has a huge minority who just want the handouts, thanks.  Or they have a huge silent (white) majority who have been so buffaloed that the &#8216;natural actors&rsquo; are able to shuck and jive their way into office and there do what comes naturally in terms of corruption and misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>I also find it interesting that all the technical positions (high IQ, high math skills in particular) were wiped out in a single go.  Were all the of the following:</p>
<p>City Manager,<br>
technology director,<br>
grant writer,<br>
finance director.</p>
<p>White?</p>
<p>If so, then whites have a perfectly good reason to be suspicious that the people _who know_ how the money is being spent and what kinds of business investment it is drawing in to the community all chose to walk due to a perceived lack of &#8216;commitment&rsquo; by the black council members.</p>
<p>I would also like to know what the other remaining council members racial make up is and why they remained silent on matters regarding &#8216;misunderstood numbers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whites don&rsquo;t vote out whites unless there is a reason.  Blacks have only one reason: being black.</p>
