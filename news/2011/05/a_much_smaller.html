<h1><a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mayday-20110502,0,6590167.story">A Much Smaller May Day March</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Quinones, Los Angeles Times, May 1, 2011, 6:08</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only a few thousand people showed up for the nine-block march that started early and ended quickly. Los Angeles police declined to issue a crowd estimate, but marchers didn&rsquo;t even fill the intersection of Broadway and 1st Street, where the demonstration ended.</p>
<p>It marked a steep drop-off for a movement that prided itself for bringing hundreds of thousands onto the streets of downtown in 2006, and a million nationwide, to rally for legislation that would legalize the nation&rsquo;s 11 million illegal immigrants. Last year, galvanized by Arizona&rsquo;s controversial anti-illegal-immigration law, about 60,000 marchers participated in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>But six years with no significant legislative reform &#8220;has started to chip away at the spirit of the community,&#8221; said Pedro Reyes, a former L.A. resident who recently moved to Santa Maria, Calif., where he teaches English to migrant farm workers. &#8220;It&rsquo;s definitely causing a toll.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} And instead of young couples pushing strollers, most marchers were union members  &mdash;  particularly from the Service Employees International Union, which turned out hundreds of people  &mdash;  or members of a socialist or communist group.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re here because Obama is a liar,&#8221; said Carlos Escorcia, a member of the Nicaraguan socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front. &#8220;He promised legalization. When he could have done it, he didn&rsquo;t. This government&rsquo;s worse than Bush&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many expressed disappointment with the Obama administration&rsquo;s aggressive enforcement of immigration laws and increase in deportations  &mdash;  a strategy aimed in part at winning support for comprehensive reform from political moderates who believe the government has failed in past enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One [Obama supporter] was Luis Serrano, 23, a history student at Los Angeles Valley College who hopes to attend a four-year college and get his teaching credential.</p>
<p>The chances for real reform, he said, seem &#8220;very slim&#8221; these days. The Sylmar High School graduate saw this as the reason for the march&rsquo;s low turnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people are starting to lose hope,&#8221; he said.<br>

<p>That goes to show you the sorts of fruits and nuts that showed up to rally for open borders this year.  They&rsquo;re so whacked out that they think what Obama is doing is aggressively enforcing immigration laws.  Or maybe too many people smoked too many of those funny cigarettes.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that I think the turnout is way down for these May Day style events because the Hispanics think they&rsquo;ve won   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s clear sailing for them in Southern California demographics, they know that Governor Jerry Brown is on their side, they know that Governor-in-Waiting Gavin Newsom is on their side, they know that Attorney General Kamala Harris is on their side, and in spite of the far left whining about supposed Obama &#8220;immigration enforcement,&#8221; they know that Obama and Eric Holder are on their side.  Even if California weren&rsquo;t about to become a sanctuary state again, what good would reporting them to Obama/Holder ICE do, when ICE usually instructs you to let them go?</p>

		<p>The highest hopes of the far left and its illegal fellow travelers rested in Obama, the great black hope, the man who would secure reparations for blacks and reconquista for Mexicans.  Now, he&rsquo;s turned out to be just another wishy-washy politician, and about the only people the left can turn out for these events are communists and union minority folks who are bused in. </p>

		<p> They have won as far as I can see. The Feds. still are half stepping after them and we have been painted as racists for daring to demand enforcement. We are just going to have to relise that electing either of the duopoly parties  is getting us nowhere and we need to look at third parties not to stop immigration but simply to try to defend our right to exist and hope they don&rsquo;t sell us out as soon as they are elected if that.</p>

		<p>May Day in 2006 was primarily an announcement of a secessionist movement for three or four states to be split off into a Mexican-like country.  It also featured immigration agitation and labor unionization, but its number one issue as shown by speeches, signs, flags, and taunts was to kick off a secession movement in favor of Spanish-language culture.</p>
<p>Local daily newspapers have now revised history to characterize the May Day, 2006, marches as pro-labor union, and I see that some here saw the event as pro-unlimited immigration.</p>
<p>However, it really was a huge secessionist campaign that was embodied in the May Day, 2006, marches, speeches, and symbols.</p>

		<p>@1 Question Diversity,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The truth of the matter is that I think the turnout is way down for these May Day style events because the Hispanics think they&rsquo;ve won&hellip;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No QD, they&rsquo;ve been told to shut up and let the bet ride.</p>
<p>The apparency of contestment -between- the Obama administration and the Hispanic commmunity is what is the engineered condition.  Perhaps they are cutting ropes for a better bet, later.  Perhaps Obama needs to be given some just-me time to build back some political gravitasse of his own.</p>
<p>Whatever is happening, there are too many forces coming together at the same time for it to not be a case of putting some pots at the back of the stove and front burnering what makes the room smell good.</p>
<p>The one thing that Democrats have down better than Republicans is an ability to _functionally achieve something_ when they hold their little convocations.</p>
<p>Even if that goal is pure disinformation.</p>
<p>The Hispanics came to the White House and the word was to scale back and hunker down because bigger things were coming that would change the game.</p>
<p>Proof?  Don&rsquo;t have any, beyond gut feelings.  But I think this-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
And instead of young couples pushing strollers,&hellip;<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Is indicative of the type of population that &#8216;got the word&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you want to clean up your image, distance yourself from the &#8216;communists, socialists and unionists&rsquo; (how long has it been since we have seen party affiliation be specifically mentioned like that, even on May Day?).</p>
<p>My only question is how many Republicans are also onboard with this as a bipartisan effort to undercut the conservative right popular opinion.</p>

Sandinista National Liberation Front? Why in the hell would this country ever legalize someone like this or even consider doing so? </p>

		<p>One problem is that Latino population growth is stalling as immigration has dropped due to the recession. Another is that because of this, the smarter half of the Latino population is assimilating into the white population faster than it was during the Bush years.</p>

		<p>Right, I had thought this to myself. Much smaller crowds, much smaller. NO signing the national anthem in Span-lish and adding words, etc.</p>
<p>Yet the march in LA they were flying high the Mex flag and pronouncing the name of COO-ba so fastidiously. But six years now and yet &#8220;May Day&#8221; celebrations are so much smaller. &#8220;NO we cannot!&#8221; Hopefully so.</p>

		<p>I agree with QD.  They only come out in the tens and hundreds of thousands when they feel under threat.  If this is the smallest turnout, then they feel the safest at this time more than any other in the past.  But if you look at who the die hards are, the commies, the SEIU (largest contributor apparently) and socialist groups, you can see who the rabble rousers are.  The ones who will always mob - er I mean march - for the dispossession of Whites and treason against the country itself.  There is the enemy core.  By a fluke, it has identified itself for all to see.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct Carlos. Obama is terrible. I think you&rsquo;ll be a lot better off going back to Nicaragua. Please take your family and friends with you.</p>

		<p>Ah! I think I am going to cry. Aa bunch of cry babies who can&rsquo;t get their way are going to lose their Dream amnesty again. Go back to your home country and try bitching there and see what happens. We as Americans do not want or need these left wing nuts and their Communist nonsense. Go home illegals.</p>
