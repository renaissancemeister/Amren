<h1>Lessons From the Ivory Coast</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Plaut, Front Page (Sherman Oaks, Caifornia), April 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The crisis in the Ivory Coast has important lessons for Europe, Israel and the United States. And none of these lessons is being conveyed by the Western media.</p>
<p>The most important aspects of the crisis in the Ivory Coast are being overlooked or deliberately disguised by the Western media. One can read media report after media report without discovering the basic fact that the Northern Ivory Coast &#8220;rebels&#8221; are Muslims. Indeed they are Muslims who by and large entered the Ivory Coast as infiltrators, through borders that are poorly patrolled, from neighboring countries. A better advertisement for stronger border control cannot be found. At least four million illegal immigrants, mostly Muslim, entered the Ivory Coast during the past two decades, tilting the demographic balance there.</p>
<p>And these Muslim infiltrators and interlopers, increasingly backed by African, French and Western powers, are challenging the control by Ivory Coast natives over their own country. The sufferings and violence in the Ivory Coast may well illustrate what awaits Europe if it continues its own demographic suicide and if it continues to flood itself with Muslim immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p><br>
The Ivory Coast of today, or CÃ´te d&rsquo;Ivoire, is essentially a bi-national state, although each &#8220;nation&#8221; is in fact a collection of tribes. The northern &#8220;nation&#8221; is Muslim; the southern &#8220;nation&#8221; consists of Christians and other Non-Muslims. {snip}</p>
<p>The background to the civil war and the current constitutional crisis is the massive in-migration of Muslims from the countries neighboring the Ivory Coast, mainly from Burkina Faso. The infiltrators settled in the northern half of the country, and also in pockets in the south, including in some neighborhoods inside the country&rsquo;s largest city, Abidjan. Today Muslims, including illegals, are almost 40% of the population of the country (although Muslim and other sources claim they are really considerably higher), the remainder being a mixture of Christians (mainly Roman Catholics) and animists.</p>
<p>Tensions between the immigrant population and the indigenous Ivorians goes back to the 1960s. Successive governments there have regarded the immigrants to be &#8220;circumstantial Ivorians&#8221; (their term), as opposed to the &#8220;pure Ivorians,&#8221; who are the natives. The illegal &#8220;aliens&#8221; constitute more than a quarter of the current population of the country. {snip}</p>
<p>The current political standoff in the Ivory Coast is largely a Muslim-Christian confrontation. The &#8220;rebels&#8221; represent the Muslims of the country, especially of the north, and in particular the &#8220;aliens.&#8221; {snip}<br>

		<p>At least someone in Europe spotted the implications.  Good post:</p>

		<p>The same thing WILL occur in Europe.  It&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion.  Just like the Muslims who rioted in Britain and declared they were taking over after more urban bombings,  there will be the same occurrences in France and other countries.</p>
<p>And who could be more deserving of them than the radical white leftists who are STILL promoting Muslim inundation?</p>
<p>That the US and Europe see fit to allow these types to control or influence immigration is a reflection of how cowardly whites have become.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Cowardly, well yes. Thats&rsquo;s part of it.  But it also reveals  how infiltrated  and internally weakened we are by those alien  elements who view European Civilization as intrinsically hostile to their own particular ethnic interests. They are very influential and they have determined that Western Civ. must go.  </p>
<p>We are further  weakened by those many foolish  dupes  (useful idiots)  within our own kind who have been propagandized and sold on an ideology which is hostile to European Civilization (Western Culture, Christianity,  or whatever you want to call it). Whole countries, such as those in Scandinavia, have fallen under to this  pernicious influence. It teaches  them self-hate and turns them ihnto robotic lemmings gladly participating in their own suicide (and determined to drag us  along with them).  </p>
<p>These  self-haters are mentally sick people, but I would not necessarily say they are all &#8220;cowards&#8221;. Indeed, they can be very militant and vociferous about promoting their own  cult-like anti-western agenda.  Being a brainwashed fanatic is quite different from being a coward.  </p>
<p>But, yes, many ordinary whites are simply cowards and will not stand up to them. The frightening intensity of these  obsessed fanatics can be daunting. Most people don&rsquo;t want to deal with it.</p>

		<p>Islam is today the only good weapon for warfare and attack of other nations. Regular armies and attacks will be noticed at once and retaliated against immediately by united nations, while the unofficial armies of Islam can gather in their mosques to be inflamed and receive instructions, and by way of muslim Brotherhood receive armed training or by Saudis get dollars. If this continues, they can decide to outnumber France, and by democracy put in sharia and then move on to the next European country.</p>
<p>Also the lack of mentioning Islam in other African matters have helped to cloak these thinly veiled actions and kept the western opinion passive. Sudan, Somalia and you know where. The western press is guilty! </p>
<p>The practice of accepting refugees without ID, has surely helped in letting the muslim hordes into Europe. And that to such an extent that those who first fled from the tyranny now must flee further. If just European countries accepted that they could not help every refugee in the world, they could reject those without IDs. In that way they could could stop muslim invaders.</p>
<p>Instead they have made the policies of refugees a travesty.</p>
