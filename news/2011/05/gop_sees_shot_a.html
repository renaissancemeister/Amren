<p>The numbers of Latinos are ballooning in battleground states such as New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado and remaking the U.S. political map, political consultants say, arguing that the Hispanic vote also helped defeat Senate Republican candidates Sharron Angle in Nevada and Ken Buck in Colorado.</p>
<p>Mr. Barajas [Hector Barajas, who led Latino outreach for Meg Whitman&rsquo;s gubernatorial campaign,] said Republicans who don&rsquo;t consider Latinos in crafting their campaigns may risk &#8220;political suicide.&#8221; But the party has a big challenge, Mr. Wilson said: &#8220;[Latino] folks don&rsquo;t like us very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One key target: Hispanic small business owners, who are the fastest growing segment of the small business sector, according to the Labor Department. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a coalition that we&rsquo;re going to fight for this next cycle,&#8221; said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.</p>
<p>In 2010, 60% of Latino voters supported Democrats in U.S. House races, compared with 38% supporting Republicans, according to exit-poll data reviewed by the nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center, a research organization.</p>
<p>A big reason was immigration. A Pew survey found that 51% of Latinos expressed more confidence in the Democratic Party&rsquo;s immigration agenda than in the GOP&rsquo;s. Only 19% preferred the Republican approach.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the record number of deportations under the Obama administration, and his failure so far to kick-start an immigration-law overhaul, have helped lower Hispanic support for the Democratic Party, said Matt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions LLC, a nonpartisan research firm in Seattle.</p>
<p>That has some Republicans pointing to an opening for their candidates. Mr. Barajas, now a partner at Revolvis Consulting, a political-consulting firm with offices in Washington, Sacramento and San Diego, has advised the GOP to train Spanish-speaking representatives to woo Latino voters by talking about Republican ideas for improving the economy through easing regulations and lowering taxes as well as promoting charter schools, areas where GOP views may be likelier to resonate with Latinos.</p>
<p>Other consultants say many Latinos have conservative views on issues such as gay marriage and abortion that may align more closely with GOP views.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, managing partner at Wilson-Miller Communications Inc. in Sacramento, said that if the topic of immigration arises, Republicans should avoid anti-immigration rhetoric meant to stir up the conservative base. &#8220;We&rsquo;re on safe ground when we say, &#8216;We have to secure our borders and get a guest-worker program, then work on a pathway for citizenship for people who are already here&rsquo;  &mdash;  and then quickly pivot off of that and talk about [other] issues important to Latinos,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Political observers say, though, that more immigration-friendly policies, such as giving citizenship to undocumented workers, could alienate the conservative Republican base.</p>

<p>I would strongly advise any GOP politicians who want to pander to the Hispanic vote, to hurry up and get it done before they decide to act on one of their pet aims, which is to take over the Southwest&hellip;.by force if necessary, if we believe what they are advocating.</p>

<p>Boy oh boy, am I sick of seeing this headline (or minor variations on it). </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet AmRen could compile dozens if not hundreds of such idiotic admonishments for the GOP to go chasing after ethnic voters who don&rsquo;t want them   &mdash;   and probably close to HALF of all those articles would be from the WSJ!</p>

Under federal statute, namely, Title 8 of the United States Code, they are called &#8220;aliens&#8221;.  You are either a lawfully admitted permanent resident alien or an &#8220;illegal alien&#8221;. </p>

		<p>This article confirms what I said to a Republican operative: When your party works for something beside electing Republicans, I will consider voting for Republicans. Until then, I will vote for minor party candidates or no candidate. As long as the Republicans can rely on most non-liberal whites voting for them, the Republicans will feel free to betray them. Wilson&rsquo;s comments manifest this contemptuous attitude.</p>

		<p>Only about 30% of hispanics (excluding the older Cuban immigrants) at the most are conservatives and probably many of those landed some time ago.  Pandering to the other 70% who are not going to vote conservative or Republican by offering amnesty as the WSJ suggested is lunacy.  It has (the 2006/2008 elections), and will &#8220;alienate&#8221; the conservative base that would have brought in the contributions and the votes for the election.</p>
<p>Assuming the Republicans do pass an amnesty bill in a futile attempt to obtain more hispanic votes the net effect on the electorate for them will be negative.  Specifically, 75% to 80% of the new hispanic voters will vote for &hellip; surprise&hellip; the Democrats!!!  If there is a stupider political strategy than this one I have not heard of it!!!</p>
<p>Furthermore, anytime an article such as this WSJ one starts mentioning hispanics and &#8220;family values&#8221; together in the same sentence they are covering for another agenda.  Hispanics in the United States are only behind blacks in every statistically reportable social pathology.  Yet, the propaganda machine of the WSJ, the RINO&rsquo;s, and the neo-cons continuously tries to con the mainstream conservatives in believing this falsehood in an attempt to sell the amnesty legislation.<br>

		<p>Passing amnesties do not endear illegal invading Hispanics to the GOP. If this were the case, every mestizo would vote GOP after Reagan signed amnesty into law back in 1986. We all know that didn&rsquo;t happen. The fact is, Hispanics are dependent upon big government for the generous social entitlements that are awarded them by the donkey party. </p>

<p>Seriously, I urge everybody here to start using these kinds of absurd/ humorous euphemisms at EVERY opportunity. Do it without any winks or chuckles.<br>
Spout them as if they flowed from Webster  himself.<br>
You will get quizical, and often annoyed looks from Libtards. They will eventually ask you why you&rsquo;re torturing language. You should make no excuses. Just say this is the way things are, and you are naming people and situations fairly and without prejudice.<br>
Just bash them mercilessly with their own 2x4. </p>
<p>It is likely to cause them to wake up, or at least to be tortured by their own pernicious abuse of logic reality and truth. That alone is worth it!</p>

<p>Not even close to 30% are &#8220;conservatives&#8221;. There has NEVER been 30% of Hispanics ever voting Republican. Maybe 2% is all the republicans will ever get. So they will sell out their White base to pander to these &#8220;NO FAMILY VALUES HISPANICS!  The WSJ is one stupid rag.  The RINOS have definitely taken over the Republican Party. This why we Whites need a whole new Party that pander and cater to US!</p>

		<p>Hispanics enjoy government handouts and respond to politicians that pander to them. Democrats know how to divide people and conquer - they are really good at it, even while denying so. Hispanics look at the republican party as the white people&rsquo;s party, and most wouldn&rsquo;t dare vote republican, regardless of the real long term benefits they would enjoy having conservative politicians in charge. </p>
<p>In a broader scope, the democrats are the stronger of the two parties because of the minority vote. They like to focus on how they&rsquo;re been victimised and discriminated against rather than use individual effort in improving their life. </p>

		<p>Well, what if the majority of Hispanics voted for the Republican Party. Native Born White Americans still end up being race-replaced street by street, town by town,  county by county, and state by state.  So what would be the point of voting for the Republican Party?  </p>
<p>It is 2011 and the Republican Party promotes the hard-core racial politics of high-fertility post-1965 Hispanics.  Any Native Born White American who votes Republican at election time is voting for death of Native Born White America.</p>
<p>Either Native Born White Americans become highly racialized in their politics or they will experience enormous pain and suffering in the near future&hellip;lots of tears in the future.</p>

		<p>The Hispanic/Latino communities&rsquo; vulnerability is their very organization.</p>
<p>May Day comes and goes without a triple seat stroller and Mexican flag waiving illegal in sight and nobody questions _why_?!  Come on&hellip;</p>
<p>They are a lot better organized than you think.</p>
<p>NOT Republicans.  But &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; (PRBS thing).  That&rsquo;s how you sell it.  You just make sure that the items on the list of &#8216;conservative&rsquo; include things like _recognition_ and _honor_ as public terms for payola, to continue being paid.</p>
<p>The other thing you need to understand is that Hispanics make no promises and do no work before they are paid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their version of dominance theory control of work ethics (think union) and it is highly linked to a machismo driven male understanding of who wears the pants in any business deal as social ladder condition.</p>
<p>So, if Republicans want Hispanic votes they need to give them Amnesty and -then- they need to beat the Democrats &#8216;And now for the rest of the handouts and freebies&rsquo; too.  Amnesty is like virginity here, it can only be yielded once and so is a fleeting gift.</p>
<p>And make no mistake: Amnesty is only the beginning of a bought loyalty.</p>
<p>The hispanics will want more and they will be -paid- before they next vote and the next.  Unendingly.  The least of which will be a large, fixed, &#8216;national allotment&rsquo; of yearly immigration for hispanics alone (call it a &#8216;guest worker program&rsquo; if it makes the racial lie more palateable&hellip;).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is ultimately what will cost the Republicans their shirts as their skirts.</p>
<p>Because while they -might- get away with a single betrayal of Amnesty as bipartisan necessity of staying-in-the-game politics.  They will NOT be forgiven (as whites, by whites) for doubling up on more social entitlements to essentially outbid the Democrats, afterwards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re slow but we&rsquo;re not stupid.</p>
<p>Since the working whites know what real hispanics are like and know that the reason they want uncontrolled immigration is to gain eventual dominant population status through birth rate, there is no hope of both holding the white base and extending a meaningful hand to the hispanic population to come aboard with.</p>
<p>One or the other, but not both.</p>
<p>And Republicans, knowing this, are only sticking with the aging white base until they can safely jump ship to the S.S. Demographic Change.</p>
<p>They are in a race to retain political authenticity until then, not with the Democrats nor even with the faddish but ineffectual Tea Party.  But rather with the political awareness of the white conservative working classes who could still form a viable third party alternative for whites explicitly.</p>
<p>Since that is what our government is racial-divide forcing us to do.</p>
<p>It is the Republican&rsquo;s refusal to admit their ultimate goal is to abandon whites completely.  Along with the white working classes embarrassment at adopting a White Nationalist rhetoric when they can continue to hope that the Republican Party is not as evil as it really is, that continues to drive this train of deluded self interests towards the cliff edge of another Dark Age.</p>
<p>With a liar&rsquo;s agenda as forcing agency, we MUST be honest with ourselves, accept the racist radical label and begin to separate and secede.  Or we will lose it all, as our leaders give it away, legally.</p>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
Those who favor more restrictions on immigration should look beyond the rhetoric of each party to see what it actually does. <br>
 <br>
The Republican Party exists to advance the economic interests of the richest ten percent of the American electorate. The employer - investor class gets richer by exporting good jobs, while importing cheap labor. <br>
 <br>
The Republican Party leadership plays the anti immigrant constituency the same way it plays the religious right: plenty of lip service, but very little action. Meanwhile, Republicans campaign for Hispanic voters with clandestine promises to keep the border open. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Immigration is an intensely painful topic for a liberal like myself, because it places basic principles in conflict. Should migration from Mexico to the United States be celebrated, because it helps very poor people find a better life? Or should it be condemned, because it drives down the wages of working Americans and threatens to undermine the welfare state? &hellip; <br>
 <br>
&#8220;immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants. That&rsquo;s just supply and demand: we&rsquo;re talking about large increases in the number of low-skill workers relative to other inputs into production, so it&rsquo;s inevitable that this means a fall in wages&hellip;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Finally, the fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear&hellip; I think that you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find any set of assumptions under which Mexican immigrants are a net fiscal plus.&#8221;<br>
