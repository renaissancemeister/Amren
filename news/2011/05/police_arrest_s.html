			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Rubin and Hector Becerra, Los Angeles Times, May 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After hundreds of dead-end leads and bogus tips from reward seekers, it was a routine meeting between an ex-con and his parole agent that may have cracked open the case of Bryan Stow&rsquo;s beating.</p>
<p>Shortly before 7 on Sunday morning, a SWAT team from the Los Angeles Police Department crept into the courtyard of a dreary, run-down apartment building on Mariposa Avenue in East Hollywood. With weapons drawn, the officers made their way toward apartment 25  &mdash;  the rear unit on the second floor.</p>
<p>Snapping the quiet of the morning, they announced themselves with a loudspeaker and ordered the people inside the apartment to come out with their arms raised. Among those who emerged was Giovanni Ramirez, a stocky 31-year-old with a head shaved bald.</p>
<p>Ramirez was taken into custody without incident and arrested on suspicion that he was one of two men who blindsided Stow, a San Francisco Giants fan, in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium on March 31 following the season opener between the rival teams. Stow, 42, suffered brain damage in the attack and remains hospitalized.</p>
<p>Ramirez was booked on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on $1 million bail. Because he is accused of kicking Stow while he was unconscious on the ground, police consider Ramirez&rsquo;s foot a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>Police were searching for a second attacker as well as the woman who witnesses said drove the men from the stadium. Police said it appeared there was a young boy in the car.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ramirez, who police said is a documented member of the Varrio Nuevo Estrada street gang, has at least three prior felony convictions. According to police sources, he was convicted of attempted robbery in 1998, robbery in 1999, and firing a weapon in a public place in 2005.</p>
<p>With the attack garnering intense national scrutiny, Los Angeles police officials put 20 detectives on the case  &mdash;  an extraordinary amount of resources. Together, they worked over 6,000 hours on the case and chased nearly 650 tips, Beck said. Police detained several people for questioning, only to determine they weren&rsquo;t involved. The $200,000 reward motivated many people. At least one man showed up at a police station and tried to confess to the crime, asking officers if his family would receive the money if he turned himself in, according to a police official.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the break in the case came from Ramirez&rsquo;s parole agent, said multiple police sources who requested their names not be used because of the ongoing investigation. {snip}</p>
<p>According to a source with knowledge of the investigation, the parole agent met with Ramirez for a mandatory check-in meeting shortly after the attack. By then, the LAPD had released sketches of the two assailants, and the agent noticed that Ramirez bore a resemblance to one of the men.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute. Because he kicked Stow in the head while Stow was unconscious on the ground, he is charged with assault with a deadly weapon? This sounds vaguely familiar. Hmmm. Now I remember! This is what happened to the Jena Six. The black protestors there thought it was ridiculous and clear evidence of racism for the Jena youths to be charged with assault with a deadly weapon just for kicking someone in the head. Clearly, this Dodger fan is a victim of racist and over-zealous prosecutors. Call Rev. Jackson and Rev. Sharpton immediately!</p>

		<p> Ah, yes, the glories of multiculturalism! Notice how the Times article carefully avoids mentioning words like &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; or &#8220;illegal immigrant.&#8221; Of course we can tell he was two of these things, and probably the third, too, by his name, but a more honest report would have noted it, at least in passing.</p>
<p> Now that this perp has been collared, and hopefully his partner in crime will be soon, look for &#8220;La Raza&#8221; or some other Hispanic activist group to claim that if the victim hadn&rsquo;t been White, the police wouldn&rsquo;t have worked nearly as hard to find his assailants. Wait for it &hellip; Wait for it &hellip;</p>

<p>Expect a lot more of this in the future in California because of a SCOTUS ruling today:</p>
<p><b>Supreme Court Rules California Must Free Tens of Thousands of Inmates</b></p>
<p> May 23, 2011</p>
<p><i>A sharply divided Supreme Court Monday affirmed a controversial prisoner reduction plan forced on California prison administrators that requires the state to reduce its inmate population by tens-of-thousands to ease overcrowding.</i></p>
<p><i>The 5-4 decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a California native, is a wholesale acceptance of a ruling by a special three-judge panel tasked with resolving chronic overcrowding in the state&rsquo;s penal system&hellip; Approximately 37,000 to 46,000 inmates will have to be released in order for the state to comply with the ruling.</i></p>

I would say that many professional White men under 45 are either effeminate wimps or oversexed, masculine brutes. There seems to be no middle ground anyomre.<br>

There are indications that Ramirez tried to use the Mariposa apartment to keep a low profile after the beating. The building manager said Ramirez wasn&rsquo;t a longtime resident and had been seen coming and going only in the last few months. The manager said a woman, her husband, their two adult children, and the woman&rsquo;s brother lived in the two-bedroom unit. It was not immediately known what relationship Ramirez has to the family.<br>

		<p>I too am surprised that the police put so much effort into this case especially as the force is 47 percent hispanic.  I live in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>the real shocker is that as far as I know there has been not one, not one editorial defending the criminals on the grounds that they just could not help attacking a White man because of <br>
&#8220;historic injustice and racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder if Tim Wise and the Museum of Tolerance and Holocaust remembrance where he has his headquarters defended the criminals in private?</p>

<p><i>I too am surprised that the police put so much effort into this case especially as the force is 47 percent hispanic.</i></p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t much reaction at first   &mdash;    slow responses from the LAPD and the Dodger&rsquo;s organization.  I think talk radio helped this cause tremendously   &mdash;   allowing an open forum for the parents and doctors of Brian Stow, LAPD Detectives as well, calling out the LAPD and Dodgers for their inaction, excoriating those who called this a &#8220;parking lot fight&#8221; and allowing caller after caller to speak about the fact that Dodger Stadium is now Hispanic Gang Territory where Whites are assaulted, spat at and called every vile name imaginable.  </p>
<p>Almost every caller I heard, for three days straight, on three different stations (two talk, one sports) claimed they&rsquo;ll never set food in the stadium again.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this wouldn&rsquo;t have gone anywhere.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s local paper reports that the crowds at the stadium have thinned out by half.</p>
<p>Did you notice that LAs idiot mayor was FRONT AND CENTER when the arrest announcement was made?  He doesn&rsquo;t give a * about White victims as they don&rsquo;t fit his LaRaza agenda.  He is a low IQd publicity hound, nothing more!</p>
<p>I did hear a sort of interview with the murderer&rsquo;s mother who said her son &#8220;couldn&rsquo;t have did it!&#8221;   &#8220;He never goes out!&#8221;  &#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t even like sports!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the criminal son SHE RAISED has a Dodger&rsquo;s tat on his face, a long criminal record and is on parole   &mdash;   meaning he has already been in prison.</p>
<p>She said the &#8220;PO officer got the wrong guy and mistook her son for someone that looks just like him, the police rushed to judgement, rushed to action!&#8221;</p>
<p>Several people in the apartment building have stated that the criminal was home all day on March 31st the day of the beating and was &#8220;nowhere near the stadium!&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sickening&hellip;.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>the real shocker is that as far as I know there has been not one, not one editorial defending the criminals on the grounds that they just could not help attacking a White man because of &ldquo;historic injustice and racism.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s coming! I suspect hispanics advocates are already planning a defense centered around&hellip;oh, I don&rsquo;t know, how about any and all of the following POLICE BRUTALITY, POLICE RACISM, ENTRENCHED RACISM, RUSH TO JUDGEMENT and RACIST WHITES.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t even begun yet&hellip;If the Stow&rsquo;s forgive the assailants of their son, there will be no hope AFAIC.</p>

<p>Exactly.  I still remember a liberal white woman on TV who thought it was absurd that the &#8220;victims&#8221; were being prosecuted with assault with a deadly weapon for kicking the kid as they &#8220;had no weapons.&#8221;  I thought to myself, she should allow yourself to be kicked in the head by 6 strong men and then decide if she still thinks the poor black victims were being overcharged.  </p>

		<p>Is Mr. Ramirez &#8220;undocumented?&#8221;  If so, he should have been deported after his first crime in 1998.  Los Angeles&rsquo;s Special Order 40 is directly to blame for Bryan Stow&rsquo;s near-murder.  And the fact that the Federal government hardly deports anyone.</p>

		<p>Ramirez is being held on a million dollar bond?  This is crazy; he should be on a no-bond parole-hold, as he was still on parole for the 2005 weapons conviction.  Moreover, with three separate felony convictions, why was he out on parole at all?  I&rsquo;d think that would get him sentenced to life as a career criminal (an armed career criminal at that); in a rational state he probably would have been.  If the California state department of corrections was doing its public safety job at all - instead of existing to provide makework jobs for incompetant nonwhite staff and guards - Ramirez would not have been on the streets kicking an innocent man into a coma.<br>

<p>Your analysis is spot on. And in fact, Mr. Ramirez has a $1 million dollar bond for this alleged offense, and a no bail hold for his parole violation.  So, there&rsquo;s no bail.  The jails will sometimes place bail first, and then they determine that the inmate has a parole or probation violation, in which case a no-bail hold is subsequently added.</p>

<p>Yes.  Mr. Stow was finally stabilized enough to be moved to a hospital nearer to home in N. California:</p>
<p>May 23:</p>
<p><i>Nearly seven weeks after a brutal beating outside Dodger Stadium, a San Francisco Giants fan still in critical condition with brain injuries was jetted Monday to Northern California for more medical care and to be closer to his loved ones.</i></p>
<p>From Brian&rsquo;s family, May 19th:</p>
<p><i>The doctors took Bryan off his fifth seizure medicine and he has been doing well. There have been no seizures and he still has been having involuntary eye opening, mouth movements and body movements.</i></p>
<p>Now that he&rsquo;s been moved north, I expect we in S. California will receive even less news   &mdash;   all the news here has been via talk radio, this story died in the papers and local media a long time ago, not unexpected from the local White-hating media.</p>
