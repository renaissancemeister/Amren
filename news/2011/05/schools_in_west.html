<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>PUBLIC schools across Sydney are experiencing a &#8220;white flight&#8221; of students. </p>
<p>Anglo-Australian parents are choosing to enrol their children in private schools over public because there are less children from migrant backgrounds, a new report by the University of Technology Sydney, based on data from the My School website, claims.</p>
<p>The western suburbs has the lowest number of Anglo-Australian students, accounting for as little as 2 per cent of enrolments in some schools.</p>
<p>Dr Christina Ho, a UTS researcher in multiculturalism, said public schools had become increasingly viewed as being &#8220;ghettoes&#8221; by many Anglo-Australian families.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a school that is 98 per cent or 97 per cent migrant-background kids, and hardly any background Anglo-Australians there, then that is a ghetto that doesn&rsquo;t reflect the diversity of the society we live in,&#8221; Dr Ho said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to enough parents about choosing schools for their kids, and sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll hear one express concern about the local public school having too many Asians, or Lebanese, or Muslims, or Aborigines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minority groups change, but there is a growing creed among many Australians that a good school for their children is one where minorities are in the minority. They may not use the word [ghetto] publicly  &hellip;   but it&rsquo;s the sentiment going on in their minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Auburn Girls High, only 15 of the 782 students enrolled are Anglo-Australian despite there being a larger Anglo-Australian population living in the suburb of Auburn.</p>
<p>Anglo-Australians make up as little as 2 or 3 per cent of students at schools in Punchbowl, Canley Vale, Granville, Wiley Park, Bankstown, Belmore and Cabramatta. In Sydney&rsquo;s wealthier north shore, about 67 per cent of students at Chatswood High come from a non-English speaking background.</p>
<p>By comparison, migrant-background students at nearby St Ignatius College in Lane Cove make up just 8 per cent.Dr Ho said students had begun to jokingly play &#8220;spot the whitey&#8221; at public schools, with the &#8220;white flight&#8221; trend having accelerated over the past 20 years across Sydney.</p>
<p>Migrant-background students make up 37 per cent of Catholic school students and 22 per cent of independents.<br>

		<p>Look for failure.</p>
<p>Nobody had as much chance of fighting against Integration and Race Mixing as did the South in the late 1950&rsquo;s, and we failed to sustain our Massive Resistance.  Our White liberal elite politicians sold out, and then our resistance collapsed, because we no longer had anyone in power who would fight for us.  All our leaders became instant traitors, then the machine kept them in power.</p>
<p>The time has come for Whites to accept the inevitable, and also to constantly plan how they can push our White liberal elite leaders to be on the first receiving end of the Diversity Curse.  </p>
<p>When a Whitey complains about the &#8220;burden of my White Privilege,&#8221; we need to find transformative tactics of making sure they surrender their White Privilege by never working again, or if work, only working under multiple African &#8220;American&#8221; bosses.  <br>

<p>WHERE will we run to when there is no place LEFT to run to? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Schools in West Facing &lsquo;White Flight&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a joke if about 70% of whites in the West found some way to home school?</p>
<p>What would the snobbish elites do if their decisions only affected mostly non-whites in the public school system.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that the white snobs would be replaced 100% by non-whites&hellip;by demand.</p>

		<p>What is surprising to me is that there are any white people with white children left in Sydney at all.  Story after story I read is about how real estate values and rents have shot so stratospherically high in Sydney, because of tight supply and Asian money bidding the market up, that native born white Australians can&rsquo;t afford to live there anymore, and many, especially from below the middle classes, are out and out right homeless.</p>

		<p> Western Governments are determined to back whites into a corner where the only option will be to fight a revolution, overthrw the government and then the aliens or to be completely subdued by their own government. The politicians don&rsquo;t realise they are being used as &#8220;useful idiots&#8221; and when they&rsquo;ve completely taken over then they will be disposed of like garbage </p>

<p>And you can make the joke really, really funny by having every white family have 3 or 4 kids, learned to love their race, and set them to work re-building a white&rsquo;s only nation on each continent.</p>

<p>Race never changes. If the &#8220;minority group&#8221; is Greek or Italian or Polish, there is no real problem. These are future white Australians, distinguishable only by their surnames. Tamil, Chinese, black, etc, are always a minority group - until whites themselves become the minority. </p>

		<p>Gee, we would never know that Australia had a problem with NONWHITES in their country&hellip;I remember watching Oprah ( no, I do not watch her show) just happened across it as she took many of her audience to Australia, Sydney as one of those places. Never saw a NONwhite in all the crowds during those episodes. Wonder why? She made it look like Australia was a WHITE nation so as to tell us all, see, you White folk have your own lands. Don&rsquo;t worry, be happy.</p>

		<p>Well, the first flaw in this idiocy is having anyone named &#8216;Ho&rsquo; in a multiculturalism position.  This is particularly laughable, given that Dr. Ho is likely from a nation which itself is 91% _Han Chinese_ and has absolutely no intention of changing their own socio-political position on that.</p>
<p>Next, while I admire the sentiment, it&rsquo;s only going to be a short while before either:</p>
<p>1.  Private Schools are seen as &#8216;racist&rsquo; and forced to accept a given number of (albeit higher performing) minority racial groups.</p>
<p>2.  Whites are paying for public education for people who are not themselves in any way capable of contributing to white society, even if they were wanted.</p>
<p>3.  White children, functionally (educationally) elite but by-class, middle-Australian, are forced to compete with existing, wealthy, elites and _lose_.  Because they are snubbed of positions while also facing a rising racial/ethnic tide of underclass, swallowing their own, previous, positions.</p>
<p>Australia needs no new immigrants from anywhere but perhaps Boer South Africa.  They get by on resources which they sell to the ethnically homogenous Chinese.  Relative to their arable land area, they are not a large manufacturing or agro nation so they can ONLY find limited numbers of positions for these outsiders.</p>
<p>If Australians don&rsquo;t get off their economic high horse and SQUASH this invidious multicult contagion, they will look like America.  Or England.</p>
<p>Shifting your kids around is not the answer.  Those kids will grow up to inherit the society you PLAN for them.</p>

		<p>See how these academics still cling to the religion of multiculturalism even when it&rsquo;s clearly being rejected by the people? If the white, liberal left simply sent their children to these schools then the ethnic ghettos would dissolve and the &#8216;problem&rsquo; would be solved tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a school that is 98 per cent or 97 per cent migrant-background kids, and hardly any background Anglo-Australians there, then that is a ghetto that doesn&rsquo;t reflect the diversity of the society we live in,&rdquo; Dr Ho said.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way enforced &#8216;diversity&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t reflect the society that Australians WANT to live in. Will Anglo groups and clubs be encouraged at these schools the same way they are for other races? Why doesn&rsquo;t the concept of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; reflect white children as well?</p>
<p>Chatswood is a Chinese middle class town just north of Sydney city. The schools there are Asian because that&rsquo;s what the Asians want - they reject whites, Arabs and Indians. But that&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault&hellip;<br>

		<p> As a concerned parent in a major Australian city I can tell you this has been  going on for awhile..any school with a  significant<br>
minority poplualtion,esp African,Middle Eastern,Pacific Islander<br>
is a breeding ground for gangs,low academic performance,<br>
poor teacher morale etc .And thats taken from the viewpoint of<br>
someone who has done some teaching in inner city schools with<br>
a significant number of minority students. </p>
<p> Actually several years ago I  thought of enrolling my<br>
daughter in a innercity high school with a good academic reputation.I thought I better go and visit (wisely not on Open Day)and after witnessing all teachers struggling to control classes we wandered over to the library and watched a few young African `scholars` taking a rather boisterous break from their `studies`<br>
 That clinched it for me.I enrolled my daughter in a Catholic<br>
girls school near the very own Catholic school I went to .Right decision  and peace of mind for  father and daughter .<br>
 Any parent with a realistic mindset that doesnt take a good look at the type of school and schooling for their child is letting down their child big time to put it mildly          </p>

		<p>Leftists are no doubt plotting non-stop to find ways to outlaw private schools and home schooling.  Of course, they will still find ways to ensure their own kids go only to elite white institutions by creating exempted districts.</p>

<p>We need to quit using that generic term, leftists, marxists, etc&hellip;It is so overused and the &#8220;right&#8221; uses it all the time. These terms tell us nothing about ALL those involved in destroying our nations. BOTH sides are one and the same when it comes to diversity and multiculturalism. We see it every day.</p>
<p>The neocons (there is no such thing as a true Republican any longer) are no better in terms of racial issues or our survival. In fact, they are worse.  They avoid any talk of what Whites are going through or our dramatic, INTENTIONAL, demographic replacement and could care less. You think they don&rsquo;t KNOW this is happening and why? It&rsquo;s all a mystery to them? Hardly.</p>
<p>Just try calling in to one of their shows (Beck, Hannity, Rush, Levin, O&rsquo;Reilly, etc) and mention RACE and WHY there is White flight and how we have become the minority race in our own country. Ask them what kind of neighborhood THEY live in. Where their kids go to school?</p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget to mention all the HATE crimes against Whites and the real reason our schools and our country is in a complete mess and you will be cut off, pronto.</p>
<p>Ever hear them talk about how immigration needs to be stopped and the borders closed down (and mean it)? They only talk about &#8220;doing it the legal way&#8221; referring to illegals, while at the same time, they have been pouring across our border EVERYDAY by the tens of thousands for decades!</p>
<p>Now they are promoting another Black POTUS, Herman Cain. WHY do you think that is?</p>
<p>I had a call from the GOP wanting me to contribute to the &#8220;cause&#8221; and I told them I no longer support their party and WHY! I told them they abandoned me and the White voting base a long time ago and to take me off their &#8220;call list&#8221;.</p>

Western nations outside the US have, for decades, been bombarded by images and articles about our pre and post civil rights movement. All of them were fed the same message about racial intolerance in the US. They came to believe that &#8216;we are not like them&rsquo;. They have worked to disprove American racial awareness by being accepting and tolerant of minorities. What they never factored into the equations is that maybe racial and ethnic segregation was rooted in reality and not hate. Consequently, they strove to eliminate hate and racial intolerance.</p>
<p>Now that they have had real world experiences with minorities being different and demanding change and inclusion, they are beginning to pick up on the fact that integration is more of a problem than a solution.</p>
<p>Whites everywhere are beginning to have their doubts, even if those doubts are subconscious and not spoken.</p>
<p>White flight is universal because minority behavior is universal.</p>

		<p>Funny Comeuppance Story:</p>
<p>A couple of years back, I accidentally became Youtube Friends with an Australian woman.  Very bright Advertising exec&hellip;we loved the same obscure films, etc&hellip;really saw eye-to-eye on things. She had a wildly popular channel, but it was me she was messaging every day.  How nice to find someone so similarly enculturated, at the opposite corner of the Globe. Had things continued, the family probably would have come for a visit, and used our home (in the whitest/richest/safest burb in the whole Deep South) as a base for exploring the mythic land of Miasma.  I don&rsquo;t have time for schlepping around the Outback: but was thinking maybe in a decade or so, it might be nice to have chums down there, to show us around.</p>
<p>But then, one day when she was all upset about some ecological disaster near me, I let it slip that I don&rsquo;t give a hoot about &#8220;saving the planet&#8221; anymore, since I am a member of a race slated for extinction&hellip;and that as soon as we Whites are gone, the rest of &#8216;Humanity&rsquo; will finish killing the Planet&hellip;So why bother?</p>
<p>(oh, and that we&rsquo;d just bought the biggest Lexus SUV, and had ordered the Long Wheelbase Sedan in the deepest blue&hellip;the gas guzzler, not the Hybrid)</p>
<p>Well, my suddenly prissy &#8216;friend&rsquo; began obliquely slinging insults my way, all but calling me an &#8216;ignorant racist&rsquo;, and putting up background pics of happy multi-culti-all-the-colors-of-the-rainbow-children being multicultural together&hellip;.stopping just short of having &#8220;Buy the World a Coke&#8221; as her Lead Video.  Nauseating.  We obviously &#8216;lost contact&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Went to her channel, a month or two back, and saw a paragraph explaining that she doesn&rsquo;t have time to youtube much, anymore, because all her time goes, now, to HOMESCHOOLING HER KIDS.  They live in an Australian city sorely afflicted with immigrants, and my guess is that all those sweet little multicolored children have been terrorizing her white ones.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Take THAT, Miss Superior Liberal&#8221; is what I say.</p>

		<p>A comparable development in Germany: I read about the trend in some German regions, where parents send their children to explicitly Christian schools - guess why - (there are close to 100% European students) AND (nobody really knows why, right?  ;) &hellip; no violence, clean schools, a much higher percentage of students moving on to the universities etc.</p>
<p>Now, the hypocritical side to the story was that even left-wing people - you would call them liberals - tended to send their children there - in spite of all the multicult/diversity enrichment which could be &#8220;benefitted&#8221; from in regular schools. Those liberals &#8220;even tolerated&#8221; the religious lessons, which in a part of the regular schools have been replaced with &#8220;ethic teaching&#8221; - which seems to be some kind of multicult education. Great substitute for hearing God&rsquo;s word, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>I feel sorry for Australia. Didn&rsquo;t know the problems was that bad. From what I read they are going through what we did some years ago here in the US. Here, multiculturalism is the gospel and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any turning back now that they are superior in numbers.  Let&rsquo;s hope Australia can turn it around and demand much less immigration. I don&rsquo;t think it will, but we can just hope. </p>
<p>Just wondering, how many more we&rsquo;d have here in the US if Australia didn&rsquo;t take &#8216;em? Oriental Asia is much interested in getting rid of their excess millions of people, and we are the suckers. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a white minority at a university in South Korea and then later in Sydney in a work environment.</p>
<p>Both times I was really unhappy and aware of being &#8216;white&rsquo;.  In Korea a lot of Korean Americans there is &#8216;discover their roots&rsquo; would give whites a hard time to retaliate for supposed racism that they experienced in America. In some cases I think these people had just found it really hard having a root culture so different from the host culture. </p>
<p>But it was vicious and cruel, and backed up by the university I was studying at because &#8216;of all the racial harrassment&rsquo; the poor dears had experienced in the West&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ve was constantly reminded of how racist Australians were. I actually believe these people are very racist themselves, especially toward Caucasian women and hide behind white racism to conceal it. </p>
<p>In Sydney I worked in a multicultural office and felt that I was constantly apologising for being white.</p>
<p>If I was a parent I wouldn&rsquo;t let my child be a minority at school.  Some reasons are that the attitude is punishing from the minorities and that the opportunities will go to minorities as well. Also a lot of cultures have funny ideas about Caucasian girls so I wouldn&rsquo;t want my daughter to be a minority at school; after living in Korea for a while I know what they think about white girls.</p>

		<p>Too bad the politicians in white western countries weren&rsquo;t saying this, say, 20 or 30 years ago.  It&rsquo;s almost too late now.  </p>

		<p>Poster 1 said:  &#8220;The time has come for Whites to accept the inevitable, and also to constantly plan how they can push our White liberal elite leaders to be on the first receiving end of the Diversity Curse.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  - I Always think about this.  We need to make liberals taste the diversity they constantly push on the rest of us.  Next time there is the opportunity, campaign for section 8 vouchers in the liberal part of your area.  Write letters to the editor calling for more somalis in those parts of town.  Campaign for busing from the local ghetto school to the most liberal bastion you can find.  </p>

		<p>My sister lives in Seattle.  The very few blacks in the local public school bullied and beat the Whites.  So they enrolled their girls in the local Catholic school.  Same thing, a few blacks on &#8220;scholarships&#8221; bullied and beat the Whites. (Said scholarships funded by the tuition the White parents paid, of course)</p>
<p>Finally they found an extremely expensive private school with no blacks. </p>
<p>For high school they have sent the girls to an unbelievably expensive private boarding school in England which has no blacks at all, not even any  African commonwealth &#8220;royalty&#8221; </p>
<p>They can afford it, few others can. The girls have great math and science skills, could easily be engineers, IT or Drs.  But will they be accepted at Med school?  Will they get engineering jobs if they get engineering degrees? Highly unlikely because they are White.</p>

		<p>Christina Ho had to move to Australia to get a job in the occupation of multiculturalism.  Know what multiculturalism consists of in China?</p>
<p>The Han Chinese rule in every conceivable sphere.  The other 54 ethnic groups and their languages, cultures and ways are tolerated only if they are subservient and totally obedient to the Han.  Multiculturaism consists of allowing the non Han to exist. Any deviance is punished by death and extermination.</p>
<p>What the Chinese are now doing in Tibet and that Turkish muslim territory and what they did during communism is nothing new.  It is what the Han have been doing to the other ethnic groups for thousands of years.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Chatswood is a Chinese middle class town just north of Sydney city. The schools there are Asian because that&rsquo;s what the Asians want - they reject whites, Arabs and Indians. But that&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe Dr Ho should bus in masses of africans, aborigines and muslim arab rapists to Chatswood schools.  She should talk to the San Francisco asians to find out about the wonders of school busing.</p>
<p>Or she could try teaching in an african immigrant muslim arab boys high school for a year.</p>
