<h1><a href="https://xfinity.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20110507/EU.Pope.Venice/">Pope in Venice, Urges Welcome for Immigrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colleen Barry, Comcast News, May 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Pope Benedict XVI urged Italy on Sunday to welcome immigrants fleeing to its shores, invoking the historic role of Venice and the once influential church in nearby Aquileia as a cultural bridge during his two-day visit to northern Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The churches created by Aquileia are called today to renew that ancient spiritual unity, in particular in light of the phenomenon of immigration and the new geopolitical circumstances,&#8221; Benedict said during his homily to more than 300,000 worshippers gathered in a vast park on the Venetian mainland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The pope&rsquo;s message of tolerance for immigrants appeared especially pointed as the visit takes place in the region of Veneto, one of the strongholds of the anti-immigration Northern League, although Venice itself has long been run by center-left administrations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His visit started Saturday in Aquileia, a former Roman port city where the Patriarchal Basilica was erected during the Middle Ages. Aquileia became one of the most influential dioceses of the era, establishing churches from present-day Hungary to Germany and northwestern Italy and uniting Latin culture with Germanic and Slavic peoples.</p>

		<p> The Vatican is one of the best guarded nations on the planet. It&rsquo;s difficult to get into, even as a tourist destination. Why don&rsquo;t they practice what they preach. Allow the refugees to settle there, feed, house, educate and provide money and jobs as they demand all other countries to do. Then they would have a moral leg to stand on. The Catholic Church has a history of bringing in people, helping them for a few weeks and the dump them on the local community to provide for. But not at the Vatican.</p>

		<p>The pope lives in a marble palace. Let the immigrants live with him. Just because people become Catholics does not mean they forfeit the right to preserve and maintain their own culture, free from being flooded by an alien population.</p>

		<p>I recall the words that George Harrison wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pope has more gold than General Motors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is he offering the wealth of the Vatican to help the immigrants?</p>
<p>NO!</p>
<p>It is the nobility and the peasants, all over again.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Church, both Catholic and Protestant, is serving the cause of the Elites, or Nobles.  &#8220;Get on with it, you peasants! Support the immigrants!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Church, both Catholic and  Protestant, is being revealed for what it really is. And it is not for US. Or our culture. Or our continuance.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Church. </p>

		<p>The leadership of the Catholic Church has long been an advocate of illegal immigration here in the United States.  It also insists that overpopulation can never be a problem.  My proposal:  Let the Catholic Church prove that overpopulation can never be a problem by bringing every one of America&rsquo;s 20 million illegal immigrants into Vatican City to live there permanently.</p>

		<p>More Catholic insanity at the urging of this Pope.  Pope Benedict is turning out to be one of the worst Popes in history&hellip;maybe he needs to read and LIVE during the time that is soon coming at his urging &#8220;Camp Of The Saints&#8221;&hellip;I can see him and his liberal congregations smiling on that beach scene welcoming all those hordes of flesh. Hope he lives long  enough to experience it, but of course he will be protected by the army of the Vatican, won&rsquo;t he?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I offend anyone here - but - this pope ( and the ones preceding him ) are useful idiots that can&rsquo;t seem to understand that once these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; reach criticle mass they will storm his gated compound, drag him out, behead him and turn his compound into a mosque. Its really scary how many people lack common sense, especially among Whites.<br>
I always get a kick how &#8216;gereral thinking&rsquo; these popes are - &#8220;welcome the immigrants, end poverty, end hunger, stop all wars, treat everyone as brothers&#8221; etc.. Whenever I hear them make those statements I always say &#8220;oh how insightful, why didn&rsquo;t anyone else ever think of that?&#8221; </p>

		<p>Several thoughts on the Pope&rsquo;s counsel or, more precisely, the paradigm behind it.</p>
<p>√ There is an element in Catholic doctrine that admires poverty. Monks take vows to it. &#8220;Our Lady of Sorrows&#8221; is well known. Catholic countries tend to be poorer than Protestant countries ceteris paribus. That he would not see countries becoming poorer as undesirable isn&rsquo;t unsurprising.</p>
<p>√ Most of Latin America is Catholic and by advocating for open borders in general, he could be, in a larger sense, advocating for his flock.</p>
<p>√ Religion cries &#8216;nurture&rsquo; in the &#8216;nature vs. nurture&rsquo; argument. The problem with minority immigrants, in the eyes of religionists, can&rsquo;t be genetic, but merely a lack of understanding of religious doctrine. Mormons also share this view and that&rsquo;s why Utah is now a sanctuary state.</p>
<p>√ Related to the previous point is that he is likely a creationist of some form. This reduces the weight he will ascribe to genes that were adaptive in ancestral lands manifesting differently in multi-cultural societies.</p>
<p>√ Nationalistic impulses are detrimental to religious influence. If people decide they want their traditions to inform their laws rather than a religious text, it hinders the reach of the church.</p>

<p>So true! The Protestant churches are just as bad with their twisting of Scripture and wanting to be sooo tolerant and do &#8220;good works&#8221;&hellip;in reality they are only destroying themselves and the rest of us Whites who seem to buy into their ideology. They don&rsquo;t even read their Bibles, let alone UNDERSTAND what it really says.</p>

		<p>What percentage of Muslims does the Pope desire for the population of Italy?  20%? 50%?  99%?  I think that the Pope would not mind if Italy&rsquo;s population was 100% Muslim immigrants, just as long as they were &#8220;poor and needed help.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As a traditional Catholic the Pope&rsquo;s comments sadden and infuriate me.  The Pope desires to flood the western European countries with alien peoples; the net result will be the eradication of the west, its culture, its civilization and its churches.  What is wrong with today&rsquo;s Pope and the Catholic Church&rsquo;s bishops.</p>

		<p>Pope Benedict XVI is a good man, but he is a spiritual, rather than a secular leader. As an earnest Christian, the Pope tries to model his life after Christ. While I respect him for this, I don&rsquo;t blindly follow his political policy announcements.</p>

<p>I agree with your post with one exception;  The Marxist peasantry (working class) has a great deal to do with the present situation in Europe as the church.  &#8220;Elites and Nobles&#8221; is a questionable phrase.  The old nobility are usually very conservative socially, but their hands are politically tied, as in the UK or most any other Northern European kingdom.  If you mean capitalists as the nobility, then you are correct.  But the working class socialists are more powerful in Europe, and especially France, than the old vision of nobility.  The Church, and Christianity in general has a long history as astute political opportunists, absorbing what they cannot outright conquer or defeat.  The U.S. only differs in this slightly.</p>

		<p>Oh brother&hellip;</p>
<p>_Venice_ was originally nothing but swamp and swelter, occupied by little more than small groups of interrelated fishing families as &#8216;incolae lacunae&rsquo;.</p>
<p>With the collapse of Rome and Goths and Huns roaming the countryside, virtually unopposed, citizens from the nearby cities of Padua and Aquileia fled there in about 418 or so to hie themselves furthest from _the rampaging barbarians_ who would later make themselves a home in North Africa.</p>
<p>i.e.  It was a &#8216;sanctuary city&rsquo; in the truest sense of the word: a last festung/bolthole from the ongoing anarchy that bathed Italy in blood after the sacking of Rome in 410 by Alaric&rsquo;s Visigoths.</p>
<p>My later medieval history is a little weak here (three decades people&hellip;) but I seem to recall it was also a city that &#8216;kept to itself&rsquo; in the early outbreaks of the black death and because of it&rsquo;s sternly enforced self isolation, made possible by the ability to cut the causeways and enforce month long quarantines on any and all arriving maritime commerce, they avoided the worst of the early plagues (not that they didn&rsquo;t have their own diseases, thanks to all that fetid water&hellip;).</p>
<p>What is the Pope smoking?  Does he know -anything- about the history of his adoptive people?</p>

		<p>Since the very liberalizing Second Vatican Council, 1962-65, there has been a concerted and well organized effort on the part of (what I would consider erstwhile Catholics) to re-orient the Church to a Social Gospel:  Leftists like Martin Luther King, Jr. (his first and middle name being the irony of ironies!), Cesar Chavez, and Latin American proponents of so-called &#8220;Liberation Theology&#8221;, which is &#8220;Christianized&#8221; Marxism, are extolled in replacement of teachings that make Catholics distinctively so.</p>
<p>Coddling illegal immigrants is the new game in town, not because of any concern for Catholic doctrine, for that was conceded at Vatican II long ago, but because these mitred men and the modern Vatican is quite liberal  &mdash;  -very liberal, in fact, appearances and conservative utterings every now and then, notwithstanding.  These phonies can be found behind every liberal cause.  Every single one.</p>
<p>To #1:<br>
It would be a mistake to renounce your Catholic faith because of its betrayal, in the US at least, of its European origins.  That the &#8220;Catholicism&#8221; since the death of Pius XII is quite different (and opposed to)what was before, is something you may wish to consider.<br>

<p>Very true. The Church has not survived the vicissitudes of 2,000 years without being a shrewd player of the political game. Its main aim is survival, and it has been VERY good at that. It has seen kingdoms and empires rise and fall, but it is still here.</p>

		<p>When was the last time when you heard the pope, or any other high priest, actually say Christianity is the only God-approved religion? I think the Catholic Church even had a doctrine change some half century ago denying any Christian specialness. I suppose the pope feels he does not need to remind us of that, but it would be nice to hear him say it now and again. It&rsquo;s the kind of doctrine that needs new justification as circumstances change. </p>

		<p>Christianity never intended to be a Euro-Centric (as the marxists call it) religion.  The very word Catholic means universal in Greek.   </p>
<p>Superficial high school history teaches that Christianity is a mish mash of a some Jewish heretics and their leader, Greek philosophy and Northern European seasonal festivals.  </p>
<p>That is all very true, but most of Christian theology and customs come from Egypt and Persia.  St. Peter at the gates of heaven and the Egyptian Book of the Dead are the same thing.  Persian Zoroaster was a pre Christian prophet.  Manichiasm the conflict of good and evil is a fundamental Christian belief from Persia.  The form of the Catholic mass is the same form of the Persian religion of Mithras.</p>
<p>Persia and Egypt are far from Europe in their culture and philosophy.</p>
<p>Syrian Christian missionaries reached China in the 300&rsquo;s.  During medieval times the governments of both China and the Mongolian empire sent ambassadors to the Vatican.  Took them 2 and 1/2 years on the road to get there. Christian bishops in Peking and the settlements in Greenland and Iceland sent regular reports to the Vatican 1,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The one and only reason Christianity got stuck in Europe was the rise of Islam.  By 700 Christianity had been confined to Europe by the various Muslim empires. The cCrusades were an attempt to get back some of the Christian lands.  They failed. </p>
<p>The only reason Christianity became a European religion whose membership was White is the occupation of the southern Mediterranean and western Asian (Turkey etc) lands by Islam.</p>
<p>Prince John the navigator of Portugal sent ships around Africa to India, China and Japan 600 years ago. Columbus discovered America 500 years ago. </p>
<p>That meant that Christianity was no longer confined to Europe.  It could use the sea routes to go around the Muslims to reach and hopefully convert the rest of the world. I believe Cortez had more priests than soldiers with him when he converted Mexico.</p>
<p>Spanish/Mexican California was administered by the monks and priests at the missions, not by a secular government.</p>
<p>Most of the China experts with the European and American foreign service and spy services were the children of Protestant missionaries who were raised in China.</p>
<p>I am an extreme White Nationalist.  I wish the church still advocated for Whites.  But Christianity, especially Catholicism is a universal organization.   Nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p>Re the Protestants, remember that the CofE and the Lutherans were primarily nationalistic movements.  Presbyterianism was a Scots national movement against the CofE and CofS.  Things have changed. The Protestants are now sickeningly anti nationalistic and anti White, as much as the Catholics.</p>
<p>At least the Vatican is in Italy. I can see the Methodists or Episcopalians renouncing America and appointing nothing but black African bishops and leaders.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that the European and North American welfare systems have supplanted the old Catholic welfare systems. Without the church controlling welfare, there is not much need to support it any more.</p>

		<p>When all the world is working against the survival of the white race we white survivalists must work twice as hard to turn back the tide. If an immigrant family moves in next door to you, you might want to sell your house, but that immigrant&rsquo;s family is likely to buy it, giving the immigrant community a secure foothold in your area, and as all your former White Neighbors are pushed out, Your former Whitetopia will become a ghetto, So stand your ground White people and contribute to gentrification! Italians: Listen to the Northern League, Not the Pope&rsquo;s new world order liberal pandering. I heard some time ago that a bunch of immigrants in Italy had to be moved to safety because native battalion became angry with them and the crimes committed by the immigrants, and the Italian natives picked up their pitchforks and torches. </p>

		<p>The Vatican II of the 60&rsquo;s destroyed traditional Catholicism. Two of my local Catholic churches have Indian immigrants instead of Cajun priests. It&rsquo;s sickening, the church in larose has an Indian priest, who has such a heavy accent and such limited English that has to repeat himself all the time. He has ruined Mass; and I no longer go to church, I stay home and read my old Catholic Bible. Too many churchgoers these days are pro-diversity and have mulatto grandchildren. </p>

		<p>Thank the good Lord God that I left the Catholic church decades ago. Over the past year I got to know a devout conservative Catholic. A very nice person, though cracks started to appear in the communication early on and just got worse. <br>
Part of the problem is that ultimately Catholics see their people, the Catholic people, as one people consisting of all races on Earth. The Catholics may be nice to you for a while, especially to someone who was, because they hope for a conversion.</p>
<p>What I learned from stopping having this person as an acquaintance is how right I was to leave the church long ago, and stay away. It is unbelievably suffocating. And I don&rsquo;t mean to speak poorly of Catholicism in relation to other churches. Almost all of the churches in any Christian sect are working as hard as they can to help the poor migrants. Thank the good Lord God that I escaped from all of that long ago.</p>
