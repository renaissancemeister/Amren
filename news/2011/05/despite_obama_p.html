<p>{snip} In fact, race and political experts say the fact that President Obama is Black will still be a major factor in his re-election campaign and will likely even increase.</p>
<p>&#8220;{snip} But, the sad truth is that there is a huge proportion of the population that&rsquo;s not rational at all and in fact is really driven by antipathy toward Black people,&#8221; says Mark Potok, spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a leading monitor of race hate in America. &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s clear that while Obama released the long-form certificate, it may have changed a few minds. But it really didn&rsquo;t change the underlying dynamic because the underlying dynamic is that these people don&rsquo;t like Obama because he is Black.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But, major accomplishments will not likely be enough to deter those who look at the President primarily through the lens of his race, agrees David Bositis, spokesman for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank of racial politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think that this would result in a serious increase in his poll numbers. One would hope that it would, but we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see because if we don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s an American, if we think that he graduated from Harvard as an affirmative action student even though he was president of the [Harvard] Law Review, you just can never tell,&#8221; says Bositis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What seems to be the major factor in just about everything that relates to the president is race. And no question it&rsquo;s getting worse,&#8221; Bositis says</p>
<p>Bositis largely blames mainstream media for political and even election coverage that dignifies ignorant assertions and even racism. Too often journalists  &mdash;  in order to attract viewers  &mdash;  fail to ask whether someone is making a blind statement simply because of the President&rsquo;s race, Bositis said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bositis predicts that African-Americans will be riled by this at election time and will come out to vote. But, whether Blacks will vote at the same levels as the 2008 election remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&rsquo;t have any doubt that the Black vote will go really strongly for Obama. The only question is will they turn out to the same degree that they turned out in 2008,&#8221; Bositis says. &#8220;The fact of the matter is that on the other side, there are so many God-awful people who are out and out racist and Black people feel that. Anyone with any sensitivity whatsoever can just feel the racism and absolutely know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the racism, Black political observers say though Blacks will likely vote based on their own interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The African-American unemployment rate is still 15 percent. We are still with record home foreclosures, the school funding in inner cities hasn&rsquo;t been addressed, and so a lot of the issues that were facing us when he was elected are still facing us,&#8221; says political scientist Wilmer Leon. &#8220;And, he has said, and rightly so, &#8216;I&rsquo;m not a Black president,&rsquo; but we still expected that many of our maladies or issues would be addressed and it&rsquo;s not happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bositis agrees that despite the overt racism, much can happen over the next 18 months before the election. {snip}<br>

		<p>The author does not see the frustrating irony in this article, that Obama&rsquo;s race is used far more often by his supporters than his detractors. Any opposition to Obama (even if grounded in policy and correctly sourced and footnoted) is racism. Any opposition to his first term was merely an obstruction to the natural course of history. The 55% of whites who did not vote for him are motivated by virulent hatred. The 96% of blacks who voted for him were not motivated by race.</p>
<p>Simply put, Obama&rsquo;s handlers and strategists know they can&rsquo;t fool the same number of whites two times in a row. If they can exploit the white guilt complex, pull a few independents off the fence, pander to Latino lawbreakers, and get some Acorn-style voter fraud, they should get four more years.</p>

		<p>Obama won in 2008 despite (or because of) being black.  So it&rsquo;s a pretty lame argument that this fact would jeopardize his chances in 2012.</p>

<p>I was so full of rage when I saw these 2 EX-skinheads that Oprah just had to have on after they have &#8220;repented&#8221; of their sinful, hateful past on her show&hellip;LISTEN to what WOKE them up&hellip;&hellip;another example of White (if they are White) cowardice and slobbering apology to some NONwhite.</p>
<p>Oprah&rsquo;s show has all been about roping in White women to say, &#8220;see, blacks are good people&#8221; blah blah blah.</p>
<p>One man said GOD peeled away the layers of his &#8220;hatred&#8221;&hellip;.don&rsquo;t they always have to throw God into the mix, that way the sheeple will be assured that God hates White &#8220;racists&#8221;&hellip;  </p>
<p>Wonder if Oprah will follow it up with what black racists and OBAMA have said about Whites and have DONE to Whites.  Of course not.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What seems to be the major factor in just about everything that relates to the president is race. And no question it&rsquo;s getting worse,&rdquo; Bositis says</p>
<p>Well, I certainly agree with that! But not in the way Bositis means.</p>
<p>Obama openly admits to being mentored by black radical Frank Marshall Davis. He was a close friend of racist &#8220;preacher&#8221; Jeremiah Wright and listened from the pews for over 20 years while Wright spewed bile and lauded Nation of Islam&rsquo;s Louis Farrakahn. He hired Nation of Islam staffers while an Illinois senator. He allowed his appointed attorney general Eric Holder to drop voter intimidation charges against New Black Panther members who brandished weapons outside of a polling station in Philadelphia. And more recently he attended a National Action Network conference organized by well-known bigot and racebaiter Al Sharpton   &mdash;   a man who paid for the funeral of Harold Moore, Jr. aka &#8220;Khalid Abdul Muhammad&#8221; former National Assistant to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakahn until he was kicked out for this 1993 speech at Kean College. <a href="https://goo.gl/cwzp" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/cwzp</a> <br>
At which point he served as the National Chairman of the (you guessed it!) New Black Panther Party until his death in 2001.</p>
<p>Now, the question Potok should be asking is why so many of the people surrounding Obama end up having close personal ties to the Nation of Islam and New Black Panther leaders. And the question WE should be asking is how a guy like Potok can find white racism hiding under ever rock but can&rsquo;t seem to connect the dots when it comes to Obama&rsquo;s (or his own) bigotry. After all, Potok&rsquo;s own organization even lists the Nation of Islam and New Black Panthers as &#8220;hate groups&#8221;. So you&rsquo;d think he could make the connection when the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES is in bed with them.</p>

It would appear they&rsquo;re planting the seeds of guilt early for the next election; get people to question their feelings, opinions, and motives. &#8216;Am I a racist?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;What seems to be the major factor in just about everything that relates to the president is race. And no question it&rsquo;s getting worse,&rdquo; Bositis says</i></p>
<p>No, any criticism of President Obama&rsquo;s policies is deemed &#8216;racism&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>The swing and crucial demographic for Obama in 2008 were white working class voters in rust belt states.  I highly doubt they&rsquo;ll fall sucker for the same sick two-faced doublespeak David Axelrod-produced media campaign two elections in a row, because they&rsquo;re aware of their own economic desperation, and that Obama hasn&rsquo;t brought the jobs home from overseas.  </p>
<p>If blacks and Hispanics are even one micro-iota less jazzed in 2012 than they were in 2012, Obama is in it deep.  Even if the Republican is a big business shill who can make absolutely no connection to working class whites (read:  Mitt Romney, Mitch Daniels, etc.), that won&rsquo;t drive WCWs back to Obama, it will keep them home, which, using four years ago as a baseline, is pretty much a half a vote for the Republican.</p>
<p>There are white people who in no uncertain terms don&rsquo;t want a black President (I&rsquo;m one of them), but they didn&rsquo;t vote for Obama four years ago, even if they didn&rsquo;t pull the lever for McCain.  That will remain unchanged in 2012.  Their affect on the electoral map will be static.</p>

		<p>Obama will get 99% of the Black vote in 2012, bank on it. We as Whites don&rsquo;t realize how important racial solidarity is for Blacks, since it&rsquo;s been beaten into our skulls since we were little that racial solidarity = bad. Blacks on the other hand view absolutely everything through the prism of racial self-interest.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In fact, race and political experts say the fact that President Obama is Black will still be a major factor in his re-election campaign and will likely even increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the reason is because this man is biased in favor of blacks and his actions and words show that without doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it really didn&rsquo;t change the underlying dynamic because the underlying dynamic is that these people don&rsquo;t like Obama because he is Black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t like Obama, because they know he is pro-black and anti-white.</p>
<p>Obama might be half white, but he looks ALL black and he rightly regards himself as black, and he identifies with the black community and shares not one iota of anything in common with whites.</p>
<p>He agrees with his attorney general that the Black Panthers are &#8220;his people.&#8221;  If he did not, he would order him to pursue charges of obvious criminal intimidation at the polling place by Black Panthers in uniform, carrying a club.</p>

		<p>Since Obama was black when he was elected, then his blackness can&rsquo;t logically cause him not to be reelected  &mdash;  unless something about his being black turned off voters during his term in office.  This he has managed quite handily.</p>

		<p>This is the sort of gumph I would expect from the SPLC.  In 2008 vast numbers of people voted for Obama <i>because</i> he is black, including 98% of black Americans and vast numbers of liberal whites eager to prove they aren&rsquo;t racist.  The mass media promoted him like he was the second coming of Christ.  (Granted, the Republicans did their best to help Obama by choosing Juan McAmnesty as their candidate, someone no real Republican with an operating brain would want to vote for.)</p>
<p>According to the SPLC, one could not possibly have rational reasons for opposing Obama.  Here are mine, and they have nothing to do with his skin color:</p>
<p>1.  His promotion of amnesty for illegal aliens and his telling border control agents not to deport illegal aliens.  Also, his suing of states that try to enforce the immigration laws the federal government refuses to enforce.</p>
<p>2.  His unconcern with a $1.6 trillion deficit.</p>
<p>3.  He hasn&rsquo;t got us out of Bush&rsquo;s wars like he promised to.  But<br>
he has gotten us into a new war in Libya.</p>
<p>4.  That monstrosity called &#8220;Obamacare&#8221;.  So far it&rsquo;s only effect I can see has been to increase my health insurance costs by an unprecedented amount.</p>
<p>5.  His disastrous Supreme Court choices.</p>
<p>6.  He is no more interested in getting rid of the unconstitutional Patriot Act or the TSA than the neocons are.</p>
<p>7.  Eric Holder.</p>
<p>8.  His early work as a lawyer for ACORN, a notoriously corrupt left wing agitprop organization.  Obama helped ACORN sue the banks to force them to give mortgages to blacks who couldn&rsquo;t pay them back.  Thus in his own little way Obama helped to bring about the mortgage crisis.</p>
<p>Killing Osama bin Laden was all very well and fine, but in the grand scheme of things it matters only at the margin.  A dozen baby Osamas will spring up to take his place.  The Forever War on Terror will continue, and serve as the perfect vehicle for the elites to shred the last remnants of the Constitution.</p>
<p>I am confident that the Republicans will find a sufficiently unpalatable candidate to ensure Obama&rsquo;s second term.  Four more years of Obama is a frightening thought, but that&rsquo;s my best prediction.</p>

		<p>Here is a Red Alert signal for every white man, woman, and child in America.   </p>
<p>&#8220;Former Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza CEO Herman Cain placed a surprising second in a Zogby poll of likely Republican primary voters released Tuesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with Herman Cain - he is black.</p>
<p>I made a prediction to a few close friends back in 2008, when the Frankfurt School of anti-white Cultural Marxist gang, after working like a team of ravenous &amp; destructive people for the last 60 or 70 years, chewing at the very foundations that were exclusively responsible for building this once great and once prosperous nation - managed to install Obama, a half-black Communist Marxist,  into the position of Supreme Power over the White man in America - that these same subversives would never again allow another White male to assume the Presidency. </p>
<p>Unless, of course, that White male was a sleazy, disgusting, nauseating traitor to his own race, nation and people. You know, kind of like a clone of Bill Clinton or George Wmd Bush or a Juan McCain sort of anti-white.    Granted, we do see a cabal of these kinds of white losers making noises about auditioning for the POTUS job - Gingrich, Huckabee, Romney, and now even Ron Paul has decided to adopt their white-genocide-open-borders treasonous position of betrayal of the Founding Stock of this rapidly decomposing nation.  </p>
<p>However, I would advise all AR readers to keep a very sharp eye on Herman Cain.   I have a suspicion that the Cultural Marxist enemies of Whites worldwide are thinking about trying to foist this black man upon the GOP, in a fashion very similar to how they foisted Michael Steele, another black guy, on the GOP Party Chairmanship spot.  </p>
<p>Also, AR readers should  use their brains and learn to view the current political environment as a chess game.   In 2008, the Cultural Marxists wanted to impose Obama, a half-black, Communist Marxist upon the old White America that they had managed to conquer as a symbolic &#8216;dance in the endzone&rsquo;, and as a means of rubbing our white noses in their victory over the old traditional white America.  So, to guarantee that Obama would get elected - these same forces imposed the absolutely most despicable, most disliked, biggest race traitor in the field of possible candidates to run against Obama.   A man who got into bed with the nauseating likes of Ted Kennedy, who according to recent rumors has been sober now since August 25th, 2009 - which is his new personal record for sobriety - and along with Kennedy, tried 5 times to ram amnesty down the throats of White Americans who were 80-90 percent STEADFASTLY OPPOSED to it.    </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring, of course, to Juan McAmnesty McCain.    McCain was the one candidate in  the GOP fold that would guarantee an Obama victory due to his intense and passionate dislike among traditional White conservatives.    As I said, a chess game.</p>
<p>Now, this from out-of-nowhere black guy named Herman Cain could very well be another ringer that the Cultural Marxists are thinking about foisting upon the 99.99% White GOP voters - and if so, he would guarantee an Obama reelection in 2012.</p>
<p>Finally, here is a message that probably doesn&rsquo;t apply to any regular or long-time AR readers.  I intend it to be directed at whites in general.   Get over your white-guilt and white self-loathing and mentally insane impulses to vote for a black candidate in order to, once again, prove you&rsquo;re not a &#8216;racist&rsquo;. <br>
 <br>
News Flash:  Black politicians CANNOT be trusted or counted on to defend or promote the legitimate ethnic-specific interests of Whites.  This is why the Cultural Marxists are now continually trying to foist minorities onto racially gullible white voters, and then guilt-trip them into voting for them.  It&rsquo;s a scam, fellow white people.   Stop falling for it.</p>
<p>One additional note that is very important.   Those of us who read AR regularly, and who also read other pro-white websites such as the Council of Conservative Citizens or Western Voices World News, and who listen to the Political Cesspool radio show regularly - are painfully aware of the massive increase in black on white violence since the arrival of Obama in the White House.    Obviously, there is a link.   Black thugs are feeling psychologically empowered by the fact that they have one of their own presiding in the most powerful office in America and, just as we saw in the former nation of Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe - whenever blacks assume a dominant position over whites, it is always a deadly situation for our people.    Consider what two black men in a row, elected or &#8220;installed&#8221; into the White House, would do to this already dangerous climate for whites in America.    Do the words &#8216;Open Season&rsquo; resonate with anybody?</p>
<p>If the GOP does this, meaning, tries to impose Herman Cain or any of the white race traitors cited above on us,  refuse to vote for the GOP.   This party has knifed whites in the back once too often and this party needs to be destroyed, root and branch.   It is the enemy of all Whites in America.   I&rsquo;m not kidding.   It is getting downright dangerous to be white in the nation bequeathed to us by our 100 percent White Founding Fathers - and we have to STOP voting for men or women who are helping to promote our destruction at the hands of the Cultural Marxists.</p>
<p>Stop apologizing for being white.  Stop groveling at the feet of minorities who largely despise you.   Stop being terrified of discussing race and vocally demanding that the legitimate ethnic interests of Whites deserve to be defended.   Let the Cultural Marxist, Communist invented smear word of &#8216;racist&rsquo; roll off you like water off a duck&rsquo;s back.   </p>
<p>Failure to heed this advice will spell a white future exactly like Zimbabwe.   Is that what you want for your white children and grandchildren?   </p>

		<p>&#8220;PLEASE WATCH THIS SHORT VIDEO!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was sitting in my living room folding laundry when suddenly you hear Oprah in one of her commercials &ldquo;ex-skin heads and racists&rdquo; as if racists are some sort of mentally ill people like pedophiles or serial killers.<br>
I have a number of things to say about that!<br>
1)	Skinheads I don&rsquo;t take seriously, one because I&rsquo;m not a Neo-Nazi, two, they are usually just angry teenagers who see the skinhead movement as a counter-culture movement. They aren&rsquo;t even in the same category as Amren racialists. <br>
2)	Oprah is always going on about race. She&rsquo;s always telling white women to read books about poor southern black girls. White women who watch and look up to Oprah are pretty much a part of a cult and unfortunately, will spread their dangerous &ldquo;race is only skin deep&rdquo; ideology to their white children.<br>
3)	Why is it, blacks have the audacity to bring whites on and try to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; them of their racism and hatred for blacks, yet they don&rsquo;t even so much as apologize for the chaos that their people ensue upon whites. Perhaps Oprah should bring a bunch of black thugs on and then apologize to her white audience for the rapes, murders, and devastation that her people have had on them. She&rsquo;s a hypocrite.</p>
<p>As always, this young white will simply change it to something better or turn the idiot box off all together.</p>

<p>On Mr. Herman Cain.  Two reasons (with many more to come, in all likelihood), I would not vote for him:</p>
<p>1.  He&rsquo;s black.  The Chief Executive of the government of a white country should be white.  (S/he should be a lot more things, but white at the bare minimum).  No matter how conservative they seem because of their rhetoric (which they can easily fake or rationalize), black &#8220;conservative&#8221; politicians will always be on the other side on issues like affirmative action.  Because it is the affirmative action pandering of white pseudo-conservative (not so) &#8220;color blind&#8221; Republican voters which gave them their station in political life.</p>
<p>2.  He was once a Governor of the Kansas City branch of the Federal Reserve.  Endorsed quantitative easing, opposes auditing the Fed.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But, the sad truth is that there is a huge proportion of the population that&rsquo;s not rational at all and in fact is really driven by antipathy toward Black people, says Mark Potok, spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a leading monitor of race hate in America.&#8221; I am so sick of unelected self appointed experts like Potok and his Southern poverty law center telling white people how,why and what to think about race. Groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center think they are some kind of quasi governmental organization.Who made the SPLC and Potok &#8220;a leading monitor of race hate in America&#8221;? The fact is their opinion carries no more weight than that of the average U.S.citizen. </p>

<p>Granted, I don&rsquo;t think a black person should be elected as head of a white country, but that&rsquo;s beside the point.  I don&rsquo;t care one bit for his ideology or politics, plus there&rsquo;s the question of his actual citizenship.  No matter what race you are, if you subscribe to the Marxist ideology, or if you&rsquo;re not an American citizen, you really have no business being president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;PLEASE WATCH THIS SHORT VIDEO!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was sitting in my living room folding laundry when suddenly you hear Oprah in one of her commercials &ldquo;ex-skin heads and racists&rdquo; as if racists are some sort of mentally ill people like pedophiles or serial killers.<br>
I have a number of things to say about that!<br>
1) Skinheads I don&rsquo;t take seriously, one because I&rsquo;m not a Neo-Nazi, two, they are usually just angry teenagers who see the skinhead movement as a counter-culture movement. They aren&rsquo;t even in the same category as Amren racialists.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
First off, Oprah is anti-White to begin with. She ACTS all lovey dovey with her White audience and her guests, but she is anything but. She was used to bring White women(mainly) in solidarity with Black people and their causes. Why do you think so many Whites voted for Obama. They were the Oprah eggheads.</p>
<p> <br>
The point I was trying to make was that the two Ex-skinheads and their incessant apologizing and SOBBING for their previous beliefs to a black woman and bringing God into the picture, was only used to make WHITES think that ANY of us WN who dares speaks out about blacks, mexicans, etc. and report FACTS of what is happening to our race are ALL EVIL! Those two were put on that show for a REASON!  I believe they were imposters from the get go who &#8220;claimed&#8221; they were skinheads in the first show, but were the enemy within that group. We have seen it many times before. They even become &#8220;leaders&#8221; of that group. How many times have we all seen this happen? </p>
<p>IMO, almost ALL White racialist groups are INFILTRATED just to neuter their message and make them look &#8220;evil&#8221; to the core. What better way to frighten off prospective White converts? It was all PLANNED to be that way.</p>

		<p>One thing you can be sure of: No matter how many white people vote for a black president, no matter how many whites grovel at the feet of a black man, no matter how many whites discourage a white identity for white people, organizations like the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank of racial politics, and the SPLC will make the white race out to be the most vile, bigoted group of all.</p>
<p>Notice that the article acknowledged that blacks will vote for Obama based on their own interests. TRANSLATION: They will vote for Obama because he is black. However, the think tank of racial politics above and the SPLC won&rsquo;t call black people racist.</p>
<p>I for one will NEVER vote for a nonwhite. Here&rsquo;s why: They are incapable of letting the past go. In the case of black people, they act like slavery is still part of the United States. A black man, even if he is considered a conservative, sees himself as a black man first and foremost. He sees white people as oppressors and racist and is incapable of moving beyond these lies.</p>
<p>Besides, the only way to keep the United States a country based on Western culture is to have a white man as president. Surely no one can say that a black or Hispanic understands white culture better than a nonprogrammed white man could.</p>

Didn&rsquo;t the liberals tell us that his election would put racism behind us forever? What happened? Were they lying or just stupid?</p>

		<p>RE: Those so called skinheads on Oprah.  I have always thought that the entire skinhead movement, especially the disgusting &#8220;awakening and repentance&#8221; are set up from the first.</p>
<p>Those organizations are probably created by SPLC, AJC, ADL etc.</p>
<p>Several posters on this story have written about the coming extermination and genocide of Whites.  One thing I have noticed in the last few years.  One never hears the ACLU NAACP etc complaining about TSA and its airport searches and checkpoints.</p>
<p>ADL/ACLU etc doesn&rsquo;t complain because most of the TSA employees are not White and TSA is in place ready to arrest, incarcerate and exterminate Whites when the time is ripe.</p>
<p>Some of the largest big city police forces are already at least half non White.  They are already in place for the massacres.</p>
<p>Is anyone old enough to remember when affirmative action was supposed to be a quota system?  Look at how the quota system turned out to be 95 percent non White in government jobs.</p>

<p>Umm, I fail to undertand how the clearly conservative Herman Cain<br>
(perhaps the most unapologetically conservative candidate in the race) would result in the re-election of Obama. He&rsquo;s the one candidate out there who, if given enough exposure, almost certainly would unseat Barack Obama.</p>
<p>While blacks may be overwhelmingly Democrat voters, some of the most cogent and convincing defenders of conservative principles are black, people such as Dr. Thomas Sowell, Dr. Walter Williams,<br>
and Dr. Condoleeza Rice.  Herman Cain, unless he&rsquo;s a deeply placed Democrat mole with remarkable business acumen, appears to belong to that group.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d get my vote, and I&rsquo;m about as hard right as they come.</p>

<p>My father voted for BHO. He spoke of it like it was some badge of honor. He recently stated &#8220;I wonder if they (the English royal family) didn&rsquo;t invite the them (the Obamas) because they are racists.&#8221; And then he made some snickering noise that I took to mean he was implying he was better than them.</p>
<p>Chicago has sucked for a long time for me and I might have moved back when I became unemployed and it wasn&rsquo;t looking good in 2009 (I have gotten re-employed since), but I can&rsquo;t even stand to visit anymore and listen to him bash conservatives.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll may regret it some day, but maybe I won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>I have a rotten job in a field in a city (Chicago) where new jobs are not being created and I have no time off whatsoever. No vacation at all. I haven&rsquo;t had a day off in 17 months. So for me to make a 8 hour travel by car or plane (time is the same when all considered), for a weekend or holiday weekend and have to bite my tongue for 2 or 3 days is not worth it.

		<p>I had to reread this article twice because I couldn&rsquo;t understand the absolutely asinine way this was written. This is weird nonsensical logic even for liberals. That&rsquo;s a good sign. It means that they know that whites are getting fed up so their pulling out the racist card. I always noticed that liberals pull out some your racists or not-tolerant argument when there faced with cold logic and hard facts. When they stuff like this it means there scared. And yes blacks will vote for Obama because he is in their self-interest. And unless that instill some white guilt I don&rsquo;t think Obama us going to make another term. And even if he does it won&rsquo;t matter. This whole multicultural system is going to collapse in on itself soon and I&rsquo;ll be laughing as the country burns itself to the ground and the white leftists who did created the system that is slowly killing us whites burn with it.</p>

<p>What is it with some of you people that you want us to take some kind of pride in the fact that Obama has White in him?  Anyone who does tacitly approves of race mixing.</p>
<p>Since Obama is running for reelection and the Democrats aren&rsquo;t going to have any presidential primaries, they will likely switch party affiliation to Republican and vote for the worst possible candidate, ie, Bobby Jindal, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich or any of a dozen other assorted losers to ensure an Obama victory in 2012.  </p>

<p>I wonder how long &#8216;Steve&rsquo; here has been reading the American Renaissance website and following white nationalist politics, because &#8216;Steve&rsquo; obviously hasn&rsquo;t learned a thing about these phony &#8216;black conservatives&rsquo; that the neo-conned GOP keeps trying to foist upon their 99.99% white base.</p>
<p>Listen up: every single one of these guys are ringers.  Alan Keyes, who far too many ill-informed, white guilt ridden, white &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; will often toss up as someone who they&rsquo;d vote for - roomed with Bill Kristol while at Harvard and that makes Keyes a neo-con trained mole,  through and through.  Neo-cons are virulently anti-white; in fact, it is a REQUIREMENT, a pre-requisite to join the neo-con club.   Same goes for Colin Powell.  Same goes for J.C. Watts. Same goes for you-fill-in-the blank with any &#8216;black&rsquo; with an R next to his or her name on the political alumni ledger, Steve.  Superficially, most of these blacks will seldom let their militancy persona show in front of white audiences, because they understand that they are playing a role - and a big part of that assigned role is to pull the wool over on the white man.    But, believe me - these guys are all ringers and they can NEVER be counted on to defend or promote the legitimate ethnic interests of whites in this nation.  Powell and Watts both voted for Obama, and so did Bill Cosby - another black who lots of dumb whites think is as close to being in tune with their &#8216;values&rsquo; as any black could be.  TV images, TV deceptions, TV is your enemy, White man.  </p>
<p>Oh, and your stated confusion over how Herman Cain would guarantee an Obama reelection in 2012 shows me that you are nearly clueless on the topic of how racial dynamics affect the voting preferences for the overwhelming percentage of each specific demographic group in America.  Spend a little time on the www.vdare.com website and read Steve Sailer&rsquo;s material, which will help you lose that &#8216;confusion&rsquo; problem of yours pretty fast.</p>
<p>Also, remember - Juan McCain was literally despised by huge percentages of the white traditional conservative base, who correctly saw him as a neo-con, a race traitor and a psychopathic war monger.    This lead huge numbers of white conservatives to either stay home or vote for a third party candidate, because they couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to hold their nose and vote for McAmnesty.  But, this loser and race traitor STILL somehow managed to get the majority of the white vote - which is clear evidence that white conservatives do not want to vote for any non-white and will even vote for a white guy who is as sorry as McCain.  </p>
<p>Herman Cain is Juan McCain with a darker complexion, and no matter what kind of baloney comes out of his mouth - whites will never turn out in large numbers to vote for a minority and trust him to not betray them, if he wins.   But, hey, let&rsquo;s say Hell froze over and Cain did win by some miracle.   What would you say if and when Cain decides to open up the floodgates from Haiti and Africa and import a few dozen million of his African cousins?    Maybe you could tell me how Whites in America would BENEFIT from the increase of the existing black population percentage of around 13% to, say, 20 or 30%?  You talked to any blacks lately about the topic of them no longer being the biggest minority?   I have.   They aren&rsquo;t happy about that, so logic would suggest that Herman Cain might want to help his people recapture that status - so the idea of opening the floodgates from Africa and Haiti isn&rsquo;t all that far fetched.  </p>
<p>Ethnic identity politics, Steve.   You need a remedial course in that topic, because this is the future for whites in America.   Racial solidarity.   Stick with your own tribe.   That is the ticket to survival.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you - for some odd and inexplicable reason - still don&rsquo;t see this as a struggle for the very survival of White, Western people of European descent and for the preservation of what&rsquo;s left of White Western civilization?  </p>

I knew those so-called skinheads were  never pro-white to begin with! They were infiltraitors from the start to the core. As I said most WN orgs. are filled with traitors and so are many of their &#8220;leaders&#8221;.  I knew Oprah would play this to the hilt to make White audiences feel &#8220;shame&#8221; for even thinking of being a pro-White! It is a &#8220;sin&#8221; don&rsquo;t ya know. But ONLY if you are White.</p>

<p>Really?  Because Herman Cain isn&rsquo;t hard right, so what&rsquo;s the attraction?  Is it his black skin color?  I&rsquo;d say 80 percent of conservatives won&rsquo;t vote for him which could be the reason for fielding him as a candidate.</p>
<p>This &#8220;conservative&#8221; back in the 1990s believed the government should intervene on the behalf of blacks in getting hired for corporations and was a strong believer in affirmative action.  I don&rsquo;t follow his current position on the subject mainly because I find him uninteresting and one of 2012s joke candidates.  Perhaps someone reading my post knows.</p>

		<p>Well said Justin.</p>
<p>I believe that the next step is in fact seeing the horizon beyond the election.  If whites win at all, it will seem like an olympic victory which we will be both embarrassed (don&rsquo;t wanna say I&rsquo;m racist but boy am I glad &#8216;they had their chance&rsquo;) and exhausted, politically.</p>
<p>Operating under those circumstances, the question becomes: okay, so what now?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it pretty much a guarantee that the next Amnesty attempt at normalizing illegal aliens will be a GOP shoe-in with a GOP Congress and a GOP president?</p>
<p>When it comes to securing our borders, is it better to have a go-with-elected-flow or a siege-mentality-paralyzed nation deadlocked behind political ramparts in Congress and the White House?</p>
<p>If this can happen only after yielding our ethnic dominance of our homeland to gain political dominance for one party and/or  commercial gains for the other, what do you do when a third variable intrudes as the death of UBL?  We must surely recognize that this invites retaliation in the form of WMD attacks **inside the U.S.**?</p>
<p>WHEN WILL WE _SECURE_ THE BORDER?  If it&rsquo;s not already ten years too late?</p>
<p>I read a pair of books in the last week or two: _The Nuclear Jihadist_ and _Fallout_ (discusses atomic mad scientist AQ Khan who originally stole centrifuge plans from the Urenco European Atomic Power consortion _in 1975_ and how the CIA insisted he be let go &#8216;so they could keep an eye on who he talked to&rsquo;&hellip;).  </p>
<p>These books more or less show that the incompetent buffoonery of the CIA allowed key items of nuclear technology (special maraged steel gas cylinders for holding highly corrosive UHF gas and vacuum pumps to feed said gas to centrifuges which separate out U235 from U238) to reach Libya and Iran under the false premise of making sure that if only AQK sold them these systems we could make sure they were all sabotaged beyond working.</p>
<p>Except that test samples of the equipment which Urenco ran through the labs worked just fine.</p>
<p>Meaning that this was just another in a never ending spy game for it&rsquo;s own sake, &#8216;make work&rsquo; projects by the CIA.</p>
<p>One which would still be ongoing except that the Swiss and Germans finally rolled up the Swiss family of nuclear proliferators in about 2001 and their 10 million dollar defense was that the CIA had been using them as &#8216;infiltrators&rsquo; in the AQK nuclear network.  Except that they didn&rsquo;t tell the CIA about every customer of Mr. Khan.  And they didn&rsquo;t admit to all the kinds of equipment which had been up for sale.</p>
<p>Among the Tinner&rsquo;s personal papers it was discovered that AQK had in fact stolen, way back in 1975, the prototype drawings of an advanced, four stage, ultra centrifuge.  Which had subsequently shown up in Iran, &#8216;as if by magic&rsquo; (Uranium Hexafluoride gas is so brutally corrosive you can only use it in combination with special steels so if the material is controlled, having the design is worthless&hellip;).</p>
<p>While it takes about 2,500 normal P1/P2 centrifuges to make 1-2 bombs worth of 90% pure HEU in a year, this IR4/G4 system, which is now operational at a pilot plant adjacent to the main Iranian Natanz nuclear facility, can provide the same amount of material with half as many working cascade lines of UHF gas.  Or create twice as many bombs.</p>
<p>And again, these systems were NOT tampered with using sabotaged components from the Tinner family factories because the CIA didn&rsquo;t know that the G4 design was on the market to begin with, </p>
<p>If the Iranians had the G4 ultrafuge up and running at capacity by 2008-2009, they now have the bomb.  Period.  Dot.</p>
<p>Equally disturbing and unknown, they also have the plans for a small, &#8216;digital&rsquo;, atomic warhead that the Pakistanis (AQ Khan is a Pakistani national, trained in European universities) developed in-house for tactical weapons in their ongoing war with the Indians over Kashmir/Kargil.  Which means a small truck, not a 50,000lb IRBM, is all you need to deliver them.</p>
<p>I mention this because I think it&rsquo;s pathetic that we sit here, pretending that race politics trumps mushroom clouds without understanding the threats that _are out there_.</p>
<p>We are playing a game of finger-pushes-in-nose with a crazed death cult religion whose members are quite capable of taking MILLIONS of mazcat lives at the fatwa&rsquo;d insistence of a single Mullah.</p>
<p>And we have no real border controls.</p>
<p>If neither political party will talk about race realism and what the truth of replacing whites for commercial or political profit motive means in terms of national security, we have already lost national self-determinancy in the face of a threat that is likely going to kill us from within, on our own soil, with atomic weapons.</p>
<p>We know that this is at least an &#8216;ongoing project of investigation&rsquo; because our own SOUTHCOM military intelligence (for Central/South America) has repeatedly stated that Middle Eastern terrorists have been seen in the company of Mexican DTO higher ups and our BP have captured &#8216;non-hispanic&rsquo; illegals at the border.  </p>
<p>And &#8216;on instructions&rsquo;, let them go.</p>
<p>Time to wake up and come to the party people.  The Red and Blues want to elect a new polity?  Third Party replace them first!  I have no problem with betraying traitors to our common interests.</p>
<p>But do not play chicken games with Mr. Atom.  You will lose.  And so will your family and your neighbors and everyone within a multi hundred mile downwind tail of fallout.  For centuries.</p>

		<p>For the poster who says they&rsquo;d never vote for a &#8220;nonwhite&#8221;, do you consider all nonwhites in the same category as Blacks? I personally think our best republican candidate is Bobby Jindal; he&rsquo;s young, very conservative, and more charismatic than any of the other candidates. He also happens to be neither black nor white but I consider him an honorary white. In fact, many of the very conservative whites of Louisiana have changed their minds about him once they saw what a great job he is doing as the governor of Louisiana and I even heard that David Duke is impressed with his performance. BOBBY JINDAL IN 2012!!!!</p>

		<p>While blacks may be overwhelmingly Democrat voters, some of the most cogent and convincing defenders of conservative principles are black, people such as Dr. Thomas Sowell, Dr. Walter Williams,<br>
and Dr. Condoleeza Rice. Herman Cain, unless he&rsquo;s a deeply placed Democrat mole with remarkable business acumen, appears to belong to that group.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d get my vote, and I&rsquo;m about as hard right as they come.Herman Cain is a member of the North American Competitiveness Council (NACC),says poster #23</p>

<p><br>
Herman Cain is just another sleaze ball. And you like the NACC? Selling us out to become a borderless country with Mexico and Canada?  Read below!</p>
<p>Cain is a member of the North American Competitiveness Council (NACC), a tri-national working group of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America(SPP). The council consists of 30 members from major North America companies working to oversee economic, governmental, and security integration between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.[8]</p>
<p>AND how about this one?</p>
<p>Cain became a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in 1992 and served as its chairman from January 1995 to August 1996, when he resigned to become active in national politics.[7] <br>

<p>Tried to find photos of Cain, his wife and kids, but no luck&hellip;Only his photo&hellip;Maybe someone here can find one. You would think he would put it out there somewhere or have them at his side while campaigning.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about the first two but &#8220;Docta&#8221; Condoleeza Rice is not a conservative, unless you mean she was a Bush-ite who adhered to a failed foreign policy that believed in invading the world and inviting the world and stripping Americans of their freedoms by scaring them with code orange alerts every week.  That is not a conservative. I remember how she came out before the election and said she might vote for Obama. I&rsquo;d wager everything I have she did and so did Sowell and Williams. This sort of argument has been made about Colin Powell, JC Watts and Bill Cosby and their true colors (or one color which is black)came out during the election.    </p>

		<p>A poster above stated something about there always being a black candidate from now on.  I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.  I was glad to see your train of thought.  Mine was the similar.  I said after Obama got the Dem. nomination that (a) his win was all but certain. (b) From then on there will always be a black Dem. candidate.  The blacks will threaten a riot if one is not on the ballot.  If there is one on the ballot and does not win the Dem. nomination, guess what?  They will riot anyway.  They are the most entitlement feeling people on earth.  They will not go backwards.  Anything less than having a black pres. from now on will cause them to riot.  Time will prove me right.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see much of what is &#8220;known&#8221; (i.e., formulated for us from<br>
semi-official outlets) about BHO surviving &#8220;being dragged slowly through Missouri&#8221;.  I can&rsquo;t find hard biographical evidence that race was ever seen by BHO as a salient factor in his formative years.  What was a salient factor, the moreso because of his lack of confrontation, appears to be the Oedipal tangle that his schizoid (borderline schizophrenic?) mother enveloped him within.  Her own racial (exotic sexual ? ) obsessions certainly throbbed in all this.  The President gives troubling indications,<br>
consistent with ( but not sufficiently examined or supplemented to be indicative of ) psychopathic disorder for which the metaphor &#8220;Mask of Sanity&#8221; is a most sobering concern.  In this context, R-A-C-E could very well be central in the sense of being what has thus far masked reality.  He appears to be a <br>
President who is  largely a verbal invention, much of it of either his own doing or that of off-stage handlers.  ?? <br>
Biographical facts known / &#8220;known&#8221;/ about him raise a lot of doubt for me as to whether he has ever been genuinely heterosexual.  And much the same can be said of his mother. The very significantly heritable traits so evident in both his maternal grandfather and his putative father, are quite consistent with a concern about psychopathic disorder. His penchant for verbal dissembling is not something that would have endured honest self-confrontation in his formative years.  <br>
Race is a distractor  &mdash;  not the key.    <br>

<p>Young and charismatic? They said that about Obama during the election.  The media also kept telling us how handsome he is and repeated it over and over again at every opportunity. You forgot to add that about Jindal.  Oh, and that he&rsquo;s a &#8220;rock star&#8221; candidate.  </p>
<p>Word out on the street is that alot of Louisiana conservatives don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s conservative enough for them.  He&rsquo;s been moderately against illegal Mexican immigration but he wants to bring millions of Indians over into this country.  He&rsquo;s even been nicknamed Bobby &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; Jindal.   </p>

		<p>Also, another black making the prez rounds is Alan West, a former army officer. Michael Savage has especially been pumping for him, and I saw where Michelle Bachmann is also enamored with him&hellip;look for him being touted as &#8216;a war hero&rsquo;, much like Colin Powell was years ago.  We need whites in office. Whites only. The majority race should rule, and that&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>Same in peru. What was a Japanese doing as their president?</p>
<p>I think the shadow government is waiting to keep nonwhites in power. Remember, your race is your nation.</p>

<p>Another example of how so-called conservatives desperately search every nook and cranny to find and promote nonwhite conservative candidates with even superficial conservative values to the highest possible levels. Even when such &#8220;conservatives&#8221; as JC Watts, Colin Powell and others have turned out to be frauds, the illusion persists that the next guy will be different; a behavior that smacks of insanity. Aware that their predecessors were exposed as such, all that is likely to change is that the actors will become more convincing in their rhetoric and more adept at hiding contradictory information, assuring that they will always have at least some segment of their audience convinced. Will the new nonwhite conservative darlings, Herman Cain and Allen West turn out similarly? Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s difficult to know for sure until after the fact. As for promoting Bobby Jindal, I&rsquo;m sure that the worship is at least partially based on the belief that a slight tweak in color might produce a different result. After all, he&rsquo;s even endorsed by DD (sarcasm). </p>

<p>That kind of thing only encourages and emboldens ignorant blacks and white liberals to throw around the &#8220;racist&#8221; label, in spite of the few blacks you know that are enraged by it and can&rsquo;t respond to it.  All one does with that tactic is expose one&rsquo;s self as weak and gullible on race issues.</p>
