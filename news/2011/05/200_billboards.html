<h1>200 Billboards Showing Suspects in Dodger Stadium Assault Installed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily News (New York), May 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The first of hundreds of billboards showing police sketches of two men who assaulted a San Francisco Giants fan after the opening-day game at Dodger Stadium were installed today.</p>
<p>Lamar Advertising donated the billboard space in hopes of generating tips leading to the men who attacked Bay Area resident Bryan Stow. Police said Stow, who was wearing Giants attire, was attacked without provocation by two men wearing Dodgers gear in a stadium parking lot.</p>
<p>Lamar spokeswoman Luly Armienta told ABC7 that with the Giants scheduled to play again at Dodger Stadium next week, the company &#8220;felt it necessary to remind the public that these assailants are still out there, and if we have the boards available, why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>She told the station the company would install 200 billboards today, and 100 more by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Stow remains hospitalized at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. His family reported on its website, support4stow.blogspot.com, that Stow has shown signs of improvement in recent days  &mdash;  enough so that they are considering having him transferred to a hospital closer to home, possibly UC San Francisco Medical Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suspects in the attack were described as between 18 and 25 years old. According to the composite sketches released by police, the two suspects had shaved heads. Both had thin mustaches and one also had a small goatee. The second suspect had numerous tattoos on his neck.<br>

		<p>We should extend this brilliant new mass-technique to cable TV with a Suspect Channel, also using only artists&rsquo; renderings.</p>
<p>It would keep the cops fully occupied 24-7 instead of hassling the rest of us with traffic enforcement.</p>

		<p>They are Mexicans because they are Mexican citizens like all the rest. <br>
They prefer the Latino name because it is associated with Europe and white Latinos who conquered the Aztec pagans and owned renamed it New Spain for 350 years. </p>
<p>These non-whites hate whites so badly yet they demand anything that is white with the language religion society culture and of course the females. </p>

		<p>I saw this today. Three blacks murdered a young White teen. Could have been any nonwhite that would do this.</p>
<p> Be careful when calling or advertizing anything for sale on Craigs list or any other outlet. He had called to buy an item they supposedly were selling and how could the kid not know those were black voices who answered and then he DROVE to THEIR place to see and buy the item? </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t his own parents ever warn their kids about blacks/nonwhites and to never have anything to do with them? Especially GO to their place to buy something? His 18 year old girlfriend was also with him in the car!</p>

		<p>My understanding of this story is that the two murderers left the scene in a car with at least one woman and a child with them.</p>
<p>This means that there is at least one person (the woman) who knows. And I suspect there&rsquo;s a good chance that at least some of the immediate family of the murderers know.</p>
<p>Think about it, there are two family groups who are sitting on this info. Two of their own nearly murderd someone from another family. Left them in a severely incapacitated state for possibly the rest of his life. And they sit there. Silent.</p>
<p>What do you say about people like that?</p>

		<p>The guy was beaten, because a good portion of mestizos are in a rage&hellip;.just like blacks&hellip;over their failure to perform and they blame whites and the white power structure for their incompetence.  </p>
<p>But it is the political demagogues and the greed mongers who are to blame.  While other races think tribal unity first, the white weenies in this country put profit, position and power above all else.  Like the Chamber of Commerce, they want peon labor in this country in order to enrich themselves and their cohorts further and they have no loyalty to their own people.</p>
<p>The corrupt politicians want tax units&hellip;no matter who they are&hellip;in order to keep their tax Ponzi scheme going, although they&rsquo;re too dense to understand a Ponzi scheme will ultimately fail.  The ones who know don&rsquo;t care.  They, more than the greed mongers, reject any kind of loyalty to their people and their culture and way of life.  </p>

		<p>No warning attacks are gang related to making bones, especially if it was a walkup rather than &#8216;other fans&rsquo; related.  Wearing team colors is the same as wearing gang ones because these people think the same way about soccer games as they do turf wars.</p>
<p>Tats say gang or prison affiliations, look there first, they have video in the visitor rooms and someone may remember a car or a kid.</p>
<p>If these fine folk were present as part of the game/post game celebrations, you can check with venders and video (all major &#8216;landmark&rsquo; structures are now covered, after 9/11).</p>
<p>And if there is a kid involved, it stands to reason that he is missing school, even as the adults are missing work.  Going to a school in the right areas and having an assembly style presentation of what violence looks like when someone&rsquo;s skull is kicked in may yield results, even if the kid is still present.</p>
<p>Innocence sometimes pans out to nobility.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it is likely (thanks to the billboards) that these people are now out of state if not country by now.</p>
<p>The way to handle this was privately with cops and PIs covering the likely bases using legal and illegal surveillance to build a &#8216;public&rsquo; case.</p>
<p>Things to remember people:  We don&rsquo;t dominate the demographics in California anymore.  We cannot expect the people who have replaced us to do the right thing as their civic duty because they are not Americans first.</p>
<p>They put Family and Hispanic identity before all others.  This is the future of Post-America.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that they won&rsquo;t sell each other out for 150,000 dollars worth of Juda$.  It does mean that, if the perps flee, their friends and colleagues will see no profit in &#8216;helping out whitey&rsquo; after the horse has left the barn.</p>
<p>Get out.  Get out now.  Don&rsquo;t pretend that the West/Southwest is saveable.  It&rsquo;s not going to get any better folks, until you are surrounded by your own kindred again.</p>

<p><i>My understanding of this story is that the two murderers left the scene in a car with at least one woman and a child with them.</i></p>
<p>Yes.  That is what witnesses reported. And, yes, they are murderers, <b>racist</b>murderers.  This was a racist hate crime against a White.</p>
<p>I have been following this story closely for the past six weeks   &mdash;    it was out of the news after about a week, even though I live in the Los Angeles area   &mdash;    off the air, off the local  news, out of the papers.  Gone.  Forgotten by the local media.  </p>
<p>A White guy beaten into a coma by non-Whites.  Ho. Hum.</p>
<p><i>It took 10 to 15 minutes after the incident occurred for anyone from Dodgers Stadium to arrive on the scene.</i></p>
<p>ONLY Bill Carroll and John &amp; Ken on local talk radio have kept the story going, updating us on Bryan Stow&rsquo;s condition, interviewing the family and doctors and keeping us informed as to the police investigation.</p>
<p><i>There was a week of near-silence on the part of the Dodgers&rsquo; management after the severe beating&hellip;the response from Dodger&rsquo;s owner Frank McCourt  has been uninspiring. First, he denied the stadium needed any safety improvements. Then, several days later.. hired former LAPD Chief William Bratton to assess the stadium&rsquo;s security</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the update on Bryan&rsquo;s condition:  The doctors had a very hard time bringing Bryan out of his medically induced coma because every time they tried, he began seizing and convulsing uncontrollably to the point where they had to induce him back into a coma.   He was as deep in a drug-induced coma as a human could possibly be and still be alive.</p>
<p>The doctors were eventually able to slowly wean Bryan off of the coma-inducing drugs   &mdash;  only to be unable to rouse him out of his still- comatose state.  He is still apparently unresponsive, his brain damaged more than at first thought.  Bryan&rsquo;s family opted to move him back north.  </p>
<p>I was sure his organs would have been transplanted by now and I expect we&rsquo;ll receive even less news.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if the races were reversed?</p>
<p>The police have NO leads after six weeks, the reward is now $150,000 and NO ONE is talking!</p>
<p>I have seen these billboards around town, see here:  <a href="https://goo.gl/E3Zzo" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/E3Zzo</a></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how angry this story has made me, the lackluster response from the Dodger Organization, the ho-hum response from the mayor and local &#8220;city leaders&#8221;, the lack of reporting from the local press and how quickly this story was forgotten&hellip;</p>

		<p>The billboards are a good idea.  A liquor store near me does the same thing with video of shoplifters, showing them on closed-circuit TV inside the store, with the words &#8220;Do You Know This Thief&#8221; at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>The face recognition cameras on every street corner can find anyone in America in less than three seconds.</p>
<p>When the news says the police are looking for someone, its a joke.  They know where everyone is and can probably accurately predict where anyone will be in an hour from now.</p>
<p>The news media is playing everyone, getting us ready for the communist revolution.</p>

		<p>It is obvious to me that laws no longer protect White people who are targeted by people of color in a crime. Of course, on the other hand, when the roles are reversed&hellip; we all know the answer to that. It seems obvious that as long as we only bitch and complain,(myself included) instead of doing anything, this is going to get much worse. When the Bible says &#8220;an eye for an eye&#8221; does that mean for every &#8220;hate&#8221; crime against the White population, that we should do the same in return? Why not? It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. If the law will not protect us, and hold those accountable, then maybe we should.</p>

		<p>I remember watching this game on Tv and thinking something was going to happen. I saw all the illegals getting liquored up in the crowd and knew it wasn&rsquo;t good. The Dodgers shouldn&rsquo;t promote their games to illegals and should either raise the the price of alcohol so they can&rsquo;t afford it or find out what they like to drink and take it off the menu. Any club, restaurant, or bar that gets an unwanted crowd should do the same thing. I hope the Dodgers learned a lesson from this and don&rsquo;t cater to illegals anymore. They take two sips of alcohol and they&rsquo;re gone. </p>
