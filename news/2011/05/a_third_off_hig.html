			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Paulson, Christian Science Monitor, May 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America&rsquo;s students have little knowledge about how the democratic process works  &mdash;  including those on the cusp of voting themselves, according to the most recent results from the Nation&rsquo;s Report Card.</p>
<p>The civics scores released Wednesday by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) had a few bright spots  &mdash;  particularly for fourth-graders and for Hispanic students. But overall they indicated relatively poor civics knowledge by students at all levels, and particularly among 12th-graders.</p>
<p>Just 24 percent of high school seniors scored at a proficient level or above, a slight drop from the last civics test in 2006, largely driven by declining scores for 12th-grade girls. Just 4 percent of seniors scored at an advanced level, and 36 percent didn&rsquo;t even reach the most basic level.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scores for Hispanic students also increased compared with 1998 for all three grades (fourth, eighth, and 12th), and the white-Hispanic achievement gap narrowed. In eighth grade, the percentage of Hispanic students scoring at proficient has climbed over time from 44 percent in 1998 to 50 percent in 2006 and 56 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>But the gap is still wide for most minority groups. While 37 percent of white fourth-graders performed at or above proficient, for instance, just 12 percent of black students and 10 percent of Hispanic students scored at that level. At the lower end of achievement, the differences are just as stark: 13 percent of white fourth-graders scored below basic, compared with 38 percent of black students and 42 percent of Hispanic students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies have shown that African-American and Hispanic students and those not planning to go to college receive fewer effective civics opportunities,&#8221; Quigley says. &#8220;This is ironic in the fact of abundant evidence that when these students do receive these opportunities, they perform as well as anybody else.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t even give the sub ethnics the same tests that we give to our own White children.  Let them make up their own tests that prove they are all the incubators of civilization.  Let White children&rsquo;s scores fall behind so we can demand more money.</p>
<p>Keep things that are White inventions for Whites only:  our language, our religion, our government, our science, our schools, our women, our customs, our traditions, our spirit, our water, our blood&hellip;</p>
<p>Let the blacks have their African ways and means. Let the Mexicans have their own.</p>
<p>Let everybody make their own way in the world as best they can with the gifts God has given them. Time for us Whites to admit that we have failed to live up to the iron laws of nature through our sacrificial compassion and service to those who are beneath us.</p>
<p>Our job should be to keep ourselves above the non whites, not sink our White selves down to their level through &#8220;sharing with the other&#8221; and diseased &#8220;radical hospitality&#8221;.</p>
<p>We should demand that Whites who proclaim or believe that All Men are Created Equal go out and make themselves Equal to the blacks and Mexicans.   If they can&rsquo;t hold on to their natural superiority, we shouldn&rsquo;t let them enjoy the benefits of it.</p>
<p>In other words, Whites who say they are burdened by White Privilege should no long be allowed to benefit from their White privilege.  They must surrender all to their non white pets.</p>
<p>We must find a way to force them into the logical conclusion&hellip;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not that blacks and hispanics are dragging down the scores in civics and government classes.  They drag down scores in EVERY class.  It&rsquo;s that they are being taught a perverted civics and government.  They are being taught entitlements, socialism and redistribution of wealth, and that whites have advantages that blacks and hispanics don&rsquo;t.  They are being taught we are a &#8220;democracy&#8221; rather than a Constitutional Republic.  They are being taught that the Federal Government rules supreme, rather than the States being sovereign in all but the limited powers grants TO the Feds BY the States.  Socialism rules the class room.  All those hippies from the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s were education majors.  Do the math.</p>

		<p>This is the basic dilemma of reading comprehension. You can&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re reading if you don&rsquo;t know anything. After yet another round of &#8220;They can&rsquo;t&#8221; vs. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to,&#8221; my own conclusion is that most don&rsquo;t want to because they CAN&rsquo;T.</p>
<p>Any number of blacks and Hispanics  &mdash;  and a much smaller number of whites  &mdash;  couldn&rsquo;t tell you which century WWII was fought, or that New York is on the east coast, or that corn is a cereal grain. It isn&rsquo;t so much that they can&rsquo;t memorize facts by rote, but that they can&rsquo;t interconnect facts into a body of knowledge and build out from it. It isn&rsquo;t because all facts are irrelevant to their experience, but that it takes curiosity and basic intelligence to build such interconnections.</p>
<p>All they know  &mdash;  and want to know  &mdash;  is that whitey is evil. They wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give you any coherent argument as to why, but it&rsquo;s one &#8220;fact&#8221; they all will cling to doggedly.</p>

I would have told you I had no racist feelings at all, then the last two years I taught in 3 inner city schools and my whole perspective changed.<br>
MOST of the black kids and most of the Hispanic are truly monsters who have one goal in life and that is to hurt you in some way.<br>
I don&rsquo;t like saying this but it is true.<br>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t speak necessarily about the civic skills of the young twenty-something population nowadays, but I can attest to other areas in which similiar deficiencies exist on an indredible scale.</p>
<p>Take English, for example.</p>
<p>Basic language skills are non existent.  Most rules of grammar are either unknown or completely disregarded ( wish I had a dollar for everytime I hear someone say &#8220;I seen&#8221;); their vocabulary is infantile.  Coherent writing skills are an all but lost art due to cell phones, email, and textspeak. </p>
<p>The education garnered by the modern American student in the classic sense is a travesty, a mere shadow of a truly great thing.</p>

		<p>Wow. How is race even the issue here? It&rsquo;s sad that when an issue becomes exposed, people still want to make conclusions from a racial perspective. At the end of the day, ALL of the students are America&rsquo;s future so why be picky about menial statistics concerning race? Race does not determine performance in school&hellip; lifestyle, and the role a parent or authority figure plays in the child&rsquo;s life does. All Black and Hispanic children don&rsquo;t perform poorly in school, and all White children don&rsquo;t perform well, so what valid generalization can you make from that? None of this information will create a solution. I read all of the other comments and honestly&hellip; you wonder why people of certain races are wary of white people&hellip; -_- I&rsquo;m white, and I adopted a black child and had one of my own. To this day, BOTH of my children have college degrees, made something of themselves, and are respectable people that are making a POSITIVE impact on society and wish a better future for ALL people. It&rsquo;s naive to think racism will disappear because I know it won&rsquo;t; I just hope America&rsquo;s history never repeats itself, and the majority continue to learn that racism has no positive function in society.    </p>

		<p>When I was in 6th grade, I was in the classroom of one of two male teachers in the entire school. One day, he gave a speech about taxes and how he would love to claim the &#8220;deadbeat on welfare&#8221; as a deduction. In effect, he was slamming the &#8220;war on poverty&#8221;. This was the most memorable among a number of his impromptu speeches when describing things. This man had no love for President Carter and the train wreck that passed for leadership. The reasonably intelligent white kids in that class probably got more out of this teacher than the mandated semester of government in high school.  </p>
<p>This was in the 1970&rsquo;s and as far as I know, nothing was ever said to the principal about it. Today, I&rsquo;m sure he would be fired outright and forced from teaching. My elementary school had a fair number of blacks, but the parents of this group of blacks were the last ones who were getting out of poverty through work. Yes, there were a growing number of derelicts and this school is now 90+% Black with close to 90% on Free/Reduced lunch. (It was 60 W/40 B in the late 1970&rsquo;s). Currently, the school claims 5% white, but I wonder if these are Hispanics counted as White. My kids would have definitely attended in 1961, and might have attended this school in 1971. However, they wouldn&rsquo;t touch it in 2011. The structure of the buildings is essentially the same as in the 1970&rsquo;s, but the district has poured an incredible amount into new toys for this school. I had the occasion to view the &#8220;progress&#8221; while back in my hometown to attend a funeral. Ask yourself, &#8220;Are granite counter tops really going to raise home values in the middle of Detroit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in the 1970&rsquo;s it was not uncommon to come back from summer break every year and wonder &#8220;Where did Greg and Harry go?&#8221;. This was often summed up by a classmate with &#8220;I heard they moved to the next county.&#8221; There was virtually no turnover in my immediate neighborhood, but we happened to be zoned to what were considered better middle and high schools than the ones across a semi major road. It was generally not the elementary school that drove the decision to move, but for my classmates who had older brothers and sisters, the parents were not too keen on sending them the 95% black schools. You could pay for private schools or just move. </p>
<p>My semester with Government in 11th grade was an eye opener. The teacher was one of the two black teachers in high school who I considered reasonably decent. Through a quirk in my schedule, I had to take the &#8220;regular&#8221; and not the &#8220;college prep&#8221; class. Out of twenty kids, I was one of four whites. Concepts like the differences between a republic and democracy were like ancient Greek to most of the kids in there. There were 2 upper echelon blacks who like me, had some oddball problem with scheduling. They got the concepts down pretty well. Even with &#8220;Coach Jackson&#8221; explaining these ideas on a 3rd grade level, you could see the eyes glaze over. Coach may have wanted to fail 10 of these kids, but he had to answer to a black principal and assistant principal and I suspect that a 50% failure rate was not acceptable. If you showed up and kept quiet, you could get a C-. Government class is just not all that important when you are dealing with a pregnancy or happen to have a Forrest Gump IQ. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a high school history teacher. I&rsquo;ve seen this woeful lack of knowledge firsthand. My solution? EVERYONE   &mdash;   natural-born Americans included   &mdash;   must pass the United States&rsquo; citizenship test (in English) before they can register to vote. Thousands of individuals of all national origins who wish to become Americans pass this test every year so nobody can claim it&rsquo;s &#8220;racist.&#8221; We could even house the Voter Registration Center in the DMV for everyone&rsquo;s (in)convenience. The test would be available to anyone but only motivated, informed individuals would actually bother to do it. This would streamline the election process and reduce political pandering to the ignorant masses standing there with their hands out.</p>

In The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution, Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending point out that the longer a racial group has practiced agriculture and urban civilization, the higher its average intelligence is likely to be, and the lower its crime rate. This is because agriculture and civilization reward different characteristics genetically than does a paleolithic existence. <br>

		<p>@Elizabeth Taylor: </p>
<p>My thoughts exactly! I&rsquo;m only 17 and I don&rsquo;t have kids, so I can&rsquo;t relate to your parenting experience, but I am a student, and a very observing one at that. My school is predominantly White, and the first thing I noticed is that majority of the students who had wealthy or well-off families were in the smarter classes and performed very well (I was in those classes too). But money or being White is not the reason they are in those classes. They know that if they even think about bringing home &#8220;below average&#8221; grades their parents will flip out. Just like you said, their performance in school depends upon the role their parents play in their lives as well as the type of lifestyle they live. The students that didn&rsquo;t have wealthy or well off families, but were also in the smarter classes had very supportive families that supported everything they got involved in at school (and these students were Black, Hispanic, and White.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s jump to the students who are in the less challenging classes. As I&rsquo;ve stated before, my school is predominantly White so their were a lot of White students in these classes, also many of my friends were in these classes. Those students that didn&rsquo;t perform well had the worst parents. Many of them didn&rsquo;t even care to look at their report cards after a school year was over. Some of my friends that are in the less challenging classes (and are white) brag about how their parents don&rsquo;t give a darn, and they actually think that they can come to school whenever they feel like it&hellip; and all I can think is SAD! They have no respect for authority whatsoever. </p>
<p>When I graduate (which is in less than a month), I&rsquo;ll be proud to walk across that stage with Black, Hispanic, White, and Asian students who will be graduating at the top of their class just like me. These racial statistics are nonsense&hellip; race has no bearing on the issue.</p>

		<p>I wish it were as simple as the &#8220;why can&rsquo;t we all get along&#8221; tone of the post by Elizabeth Taylor, but unfortunately this is not the way the world works. I think I speak for most of those who read &#8220;American Renaissance&#8221; magazine and have read various books on the racial question, such at &#8220;The Bell Curve,&#8221; &#8220;Paved with Good Intentions&#8221; and many others, that I would prefer to have been convinced that &#8220;color is only skin deep&#8221; and all of that.</p>
<p>The reality is that there are also differences, on average, for running and jumping athletic abilities among different racial groups - how else can you explain that the two premier professional basketball teams, The Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics have not a single white starter?  So too there are also, on average, different levels of I.Q. among racial groups.</p>
<p>Yes, culture and socio-economic levels play a role, but I.Q. is the trump card and for that reason modern education, as it is evolving in the United States due to rising number of Hispanics and blacks, is on a mission impossible. The lower results on Civics tests, as well as all other academic areas, let&rsquo;s us know that Third World status for the United States is just around the corner - And no amount of Teaching Fellows or Charter Schools is going to be able to avert the downhill slide.</p>

		<p>Posters # 3 and 8 are so right on the money.  I see all this stuff every day.  The entire educational establishment is geared towards &#8220;social justice.&#8221;  In other words: whitey is bad and takes things from you, so use the government to take from whitey.</p>
<p>Keep in mind folks, not all teachers subscribe to this junk.  I would say that at least 20% of the teaching force is still loyal to the American ideal and still tries to teach in the old-fashioned academic way.  We just usually have to keep our mouths shut or lose our jobs.  Quiet acts of resistance&hellip;</p>

		<p>@Paul Jones: What do you mean &#8220;have not a single white starter&#8221;? Whites and Blacks aren&rsquo;t the only people that play professional basketball, or any professional sport for that matter. Those starters played basketball all their lives and become legends. And second off, IQ is not the trump card in America. MONEY is. People that have money can pay for private tutors when their kids struggle. The parents of some of my peers sure paid for private tutors when their child was in danger of making a &#8220;C&#8221; in a class. And what are the poverty stricken students stuck with? After school tutors that don&rsquo;t give a darn except that paycheck at the end of the week, and a mere two hours with a teacher that has to divide their attention amongst many other students that need help. See the difference? And then for those that graduate, what do they have to look forward too? Expensive colleges that are stingy with scholarship money. You can be a genius these days and colleges will still only offer you partial scholarships; and if you can&rsquo;t pay the rest, why bother to be stuck with a debt you wont be able to pay when you graduate? With all the educational budget cuts going on more and more of the poorer students that perform well in school will only be getting that diploma and it&rsquo;s not fair to them at all.       </p>

<p><i>At the end of the day, ALL of the students are America&rsquo;s future so why be picky about menial statistics concerning race? Race does not determine performance in school&hellip; lifestyle, and the role a parent or authority figure plays in the child&rsquo;s life does.</i></p>
<p>Statistics concerning race are not menial; hard data and careful scientific study show the races differ in IQ, brain size and behavior and IQ is VERY strongly correlated with one&rsquo;s educational and life outcome.</p>
<p><i>The Bell Curve shows how IQ predicts success in education, jobs, and<br>
training. Low IQ predicts child abuse, crime and delinquency, health, accident proneness, having a child out of wedlock, getting a divorce before five years of marriage, and even smoking during pregnancy.</i> </p>
<p>To say otherwise is to live in a fantasy land, such as is taught in today&rsquo;s high school classrooms and permeates the media: Race is a Social Construct!  All Races are of Equal Intelligence!  Any racial differences are due to White Racism!</p>
<p>Jared Taylor writes in his review of Jensen&rsquo;s Race_Evolution_Behavior:</p>
<p><i>The view that &#8216;racism&rsquo; and other environmental factors cause the black/white IQ gap persist mostly among the ignorant  &mdash;  who are the great majority.</i></p>
<p><i>children of low-income whites (and Asians) get better SAT scores than the children of high-income blacks. If environment controls IQ, the children of wealthy blacks should be enjoying the benefits of good environment. They are, but those benefits are meager and do not make up for the effects of heredity and the lower mean toward which black children regress.</i></p>
<p>For the different racial groups, Prof. Rushton has aggregated the results of a great many IQ studies to arrive at the following averages:</p>
<p><i>Whites  &mdash;  100, Asians  &mdash;  105, American blacks (who are about 25 percent white)  &mdash;  85, African blacks  &mdash;  70 to 75, Amerindians (including Central and Latin Americans with little or no European blood)  &mdash;  89, Polynesians, Micronesians, Melanesians, and Maoris  &mdash;  80 to 95.</i></p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p><i>Both science and justice call for us to seek and tell the truth, not to tell lies and spread error.</i></p>

		<p>A couple of really naive posters here who need to return often and read this site a lot more. Especially notice how many postings are by teachers, who know what they are talking about. Black and Hispanic kids (more the Blacks) do not pay attention, come to school, come on time, listen, be polite, do homework, do classwork, or care.</p>
<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t mean 100%- what do you think, we&rsquo;re stupid? We&rsquo;re talking about the average black kid. It&rsquo;s great that you walked across the stage with black graduates or adopted black kids. (You seem very pleased with yourself about it.) That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that black kids FOR THE MOST PART (90%?) hate white teachers and learning.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve taught in an inner-city school going in as naive as you are now, and becoming race-concious in 2 years, come back and talk to us. You&rsquo;re quoting anecdotes about rainbows and unicorns   &mdash;   we&rsquo;re talking facts and experience.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to sound crude, but it is irritating to have people who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about telling urban teachers they don&rsquo;t know what THEY are talking about.</p>
<p>As for the guy who said he wanted a dollar for everytime he heard &#8220;I seen&#8221;..hehe&hellip;I taught in central MO. too. Even the superintendent and teachers did it. May aide got a bit huffy when I told the class that if they leave the area people will look down on them for saying &#8220;I seen&#8221; and &#8220;I done.&#8221; Never could get him to change it, even tho&rsquo; he had a responsibility to sound correct for the students. I think he thought it was &#8220;acting uppity,&#8221; just like some black kids think studying is &#8220;acting white.&#8221;  </p>

You&rsquo;re definitely right about me not having any experience teaching, but you call me naive, and yet the TEACHERS are stooping to racism -_- &hellip; If anything, they failed as teachers by not being able to control their class. Parents these days are getting slack on teaching their kids how to behave, and unfortunately this travels into the classroom as well but hey, these &#8220;teachers&#8221; know what they signed up for(they were students as well), and if all they want to do is complain and blame it on the majority of misbehaved Blacks or Hispanics THEN GET ANOTHER JOB and admit you don&rsquo;t have what it takes to get your students in line. Matter of fact, they should update those credentials and teach the rich, preppy kids. You can try to justify it, defend them, and claim they know what they&rsquo;re talking about, but at the end of the day, IN REALITY, they&rsquo;re nothing but people who want to stir up the problem and attach racial issues to it&hellip; And just so you know, more interracial relationships are occurring in the United States and White people are no longer the majority, so I suggest you just suck it up and stop whining. It&rsquo;s funny how you want to point fingers at the &#8220;majority&#8221;&hellip; oh they do this and that. WHO CARES? If you&rsquo;re not going to point out a solution then what&rsquo;s the point of harping on the subject? lol My parents always told me that people that point out problems and don&rsquo;t attach a solution are &#8220;lazy losers&#8221;. Lazy because they don&rsquo;t want to bother with the problem, and losers because they just want to talk about it. #Done    </p>

I taught school for 20 years.<br>
I would have told you I had no racist feelings at all, then the last two years I taught in 3 inner city schools and my whole perspective changed.<br>
MOST of the black kids and most of the Hispanic are truly monsters who have one goal in life and that is to hurt you in some way.</p>
<p>jerry, i taught in a 99 percent black school for just one year.  The kids were not welfare, the parents were mostly middle class civil servants.  That was in 1986-87.  To this day I cannot stand to look at or hear a black person of any kind.</p>

		<p>As far as IQ and poverty goes, here are the facts about my family.  Dad worked for low wages in a non union factory.  His take home was actually less than what welfare would have paid for a family of 7, 2 parents and 5 children.</p>
<p>Here are the children&rsquo;s IQs from highest to lowest 134, 130, 127, 120, 110.</p>

		<p>An education, especially in things like engineering, IT or anything can&rsquo;t help a White get a job after graduation. I&rsquo;m sick and tired of aware Whit Nationalists who are so naive as to think that a good degree or excellent qualifications will get them a job. The government enforces the affirmative action laws ferociously.  Employeers just don&rsquo;t want us at all.</p>
<p> Even White accountants have troubles, Fillipino women are being imported for those jobs.  White nurses, physical therapists and other health care professions are first fired, last hired if hired at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting some money from a medical malpractice lawsuit.  Because the malpractice disabled me, I am in an assisted living home.</p>
<p>My grand children are under 10.  I think I might sell the house and use the proceeds and the malpractice settlement to buy them Subway Sandwich franchises or something like that rather than paying tuition for 4 years of anti White racist propaganda and a piece of paper useless because they are White.  A good college degree can cost $160,000 tuition and $35,00 living expenses.<br>
Think how much better to put that money down on an apartment house.  Income, a place to live and property always goes up in value.</p>

<p>Ha Ha Ha!!</p>
<p>Congratulations!  You have written <b>The</b> most naive, clueless post I&rsquo;ve read on this board for the entire year.</p>
<p>You are 17 years old and have NO first hand teaching experience, have little life experience, lack an educational background, yet you come on here scolding us and pontificating about what we &#8220;teachers&#8221; should do:</p>
<p><i>You&rsquo;re definitely right about me not having any experience teaching</i></p>
<p>Then you have <b>no business</b> telling me, or any other teacher one single thing.  </p>
<p>Unlike you, at 17, many here, including me, have had years of first-hand, hard core experience in the entrenched, anti-White, PC-dominated, government educational system.</p>
<p>But, you know better than I do, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><i>but you call me naive, and yet the TEACHERS are stooping to racism -_- &hellip; If anything, they failed as teachers by not being able to control their class.</i></p>
<p>God, save me from such naiveté!  </p>
<p>Have you ever stood, by yourself, in front of a class of 40+ students of <i>all</i> abilities, some with psychiatric disorders, some of whom are barely literate, some of whom have ADD (look it up) and cannot stay in their seats <i>no matter what you do</i>, along with kids of average intelligence and above average intelligence?  </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t know of any 17-year old teachers with college degrees or years of first-hand teaching experience.</p>
<p>What I have described is what a modern, common, government high school classroom looks like in California and many other places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see you try to handle it.</p>
<p>Have you ever been called into your boss&rsquo;s office and told YOU are the problem, it is your fault that your 11th grade students with Grade 1 reading levels scored in the 2% on the state tests?  You are a poor teacher because psychotic, unmedicated students, those whose parents refuse to allow them to be &#8220;drugged&#8221; at school (so the parent can double dose them when the kid get home)   &mdash;  scream out of your doorway, unzip their pants, run uncontrollably in the classroom and down the halls   &mdash;   but You are told in the office that YOU are the problem because you can&rsquo;t control your classes?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so.  I don&rsquo;t know of any 17-year olds with years of experience in the workforce, especially an anti-White workforce.  Come back when you&rsquo;ve had some experience with anti-White racism in the &#8220;real world&#8221;, which you WILL find once you leave the PC cocoon of high school and college. </p>
<p>The &#8220;real world&#8221; being vastly different from that of high school or college, of course.  You&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p><i>THEN GET ANOTHER JOB and admit you don&rsquo;t have what it takes to get your students in line.</i></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Wow, Whew!  Thanks for that!  I wonder if Barnes &amp; Noble is hiring   &mdash;  what&rsquo;s that you say?  Barnes &amp; Noble is going out of business due to the e book market?  Oh, anywhere else an overqualified, dissatisfied teacher can work?  Fast food?  Nope!! Those jobs are taken by adult Mexicans.  Same with the supermarkets and car washes!</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t <b>you</b> come into my classroom and show me how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p><i>Matter of fact, they should update those credentials and teach the rich, preppy kids.</i></p>
<p>Oh, yeah, right!  Whew!  Never thought of it.  </p>
<p><i>that people that point out problems and don&rsquo;t attach a solution are &ldquo;lazy losers&rdquo;. Lazy because they don&rsquo;t want to bother with the problem, and losers because they just want to talk about it.</i></p>
<p>Wow!  Thanks for that!  I never imagined such wise, profound words coming from a 17-year old   &mdash;   you sure told us didn&rsquo;t you, with all your 17-years of wisdom.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!  I have a strong feeling you&rsquo;re going to need it.</p>

<p>You seem to have a lot of advice about teaching, especially for someone who had never taught and has all of seventeen years of life experience otherwise.  My advice is for you to move out of your parents house and change the world at the drop of a hat while you still know everything.  As for me, I&rsquo;ll wait for Bon and Jay to weigh in, people who actually teach the third world among us, until I form opinions.</p>
<p>However, as much as I want to pick on you and your juvenile gibberish, the sad truth of the matter is that what you say is taken as serious educational policy by educrats three times your age.</p>
<p><i>My parents always told me that people that point out problems and don&rsquo;t attach a solution are &ldquo;lazy losers&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I take a different view   &mdash;   people who point out problems yet who have not arrived at a coherent solution are sometimes smart, because they don&rsquo;t rush toward a solution with abandon.  Maybe because they think they don&rsquo;t know the entirety of the problem yet.  Maybe because they know they need more facts before they can arrive at a solution.  Maybe because most people who see problems don&rsquo;t have the power to translate solutions into actual public policy, so they don&rsquo;t bother thinking about solutions.  Maybe, just maybe, such people are a little older than 17 and therefore have way too many irons in the fire to think about solutions.</p>
<p>I bet your parents are the type who constantly parrot the cliche that if you don&rsquo;t vote, then you can&rsquo;t complain.  If you truly believe that, then you also believe that people who don&rsquo;t vote don&rsquo;t have any civil liberties or civil rights, or that some level of government has carte blance permission to screw them over however it wants simply because the victim is a non-voter.</p>

		<p>All of you who got offended by my comments&hellip; oh well. But anyway, I&rsquo;m not saying I know everything (MY PARENTS LET ME KNOW THAT ALL THE TIME) and who knows, maybe it is &#8220;naive&#8221; for a 17 year old to tell an older racist person how to do their job, but who&rsquo;s going to take you seriously? I&rsquo;m pretty sure the majority would rather listen to a 17 year old, than listen to a racist&hellip; and that&rsquo;s the hard, cold truth. People respect ignorant teenagers that don&rsquo;t know much about the world more than you racists with college degrees who rant about things that the majority don&rsquo;t care to hear anymore. No one extremely important in America that the majority respects would ever want to be affiliated with you&hellip; another hard, cold truth. All of these statistics and research projects are fine and all, but what do you hope to achieve or change? And please, I want an honest answer. You don&rsquo;t have to be nasty about it. What exactly do you hope to achieve by exposing this information, and what types of changes do you hope to bring about?    </p>

		<p>Please Melanie,  you are biased.  Do you really justify calling a teacher racist due to the fact that they observe their environment.  Are you that thick headed?  You don&rsquo;t put any blame on the Hispanic and black parents who teach them to hate;  You don&rsquo;t care about their upbringing,  you believe they should not have any responsibilities.  Why is this?  You have low standards for them,  that&rsquo;s why.  Think about it,  blacks and Hispanics are allowed to hate,  and liberals allow them,  because they expect nothing more.  They believe,  ( or most certainly act like they do) that minorities have the mental capacity of a baby,  all while pointing fingers at us calling us racists.  If you do not have as high standards for minorities as you do whites, and you claim to view them as equal,  then you are racist, hypocritical, and naive .  Disgusted teachers initially trying to view them as equals,  who have been witness to too much,  have a right to be racist and should let the world know.  I only hope they can find a job in a nicer school. </p>

		<p>Melanie,  what you need to realize is that this isn&rsquo;t your little euphoric fantasy land.  You are 17.  I hate to break it to you,  but the majority of non whites have a deep,  ingrained, string feeling toward whites;  it is comprised of extreme hatred based on the past and severe jealousy which pushes it forward,  derived from not fitting in .  You don&rsquo;t realize this, among other things.  You need to realize this:  non whites think about race more than you could imagine right now.  You also need to see that just because someone denounces something ( such as racism) it disentangle mean they don&rsquo;t share that view.  The majority of people in this world fake reactions,  or nod in agreement at the time it is needed,  for social gains.  You really have allot to learn,  and so do some whites that don&rsquo;t realize how minorities really feel about us.  This is what I want white people to understand.  It is this:  Stop being played,  minorities hate you.  Dont be played,  be the player.  Blacks and Hispanics do not understand cause and effect,  which is why they can&rsquo;t realize why their racist actions bring racism in return.  </p>
