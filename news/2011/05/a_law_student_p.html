<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In late April, Johnathan Perkins, a third-year law student at UVA, wrote a letter to the editor that was published in Virginia Law Weekly, the law school&rsquo;s student newspaper. In his letter, Perkins claimed that he was harassed by UVA university police while walking home from a party, purportedly on account of his race (he&rsquo;s African-American). Perkins said he was moved to share the story &#8220;because it is important for my classmates to hear a real-life anecdote illustrating the myth of equal protection under the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trouble is, it was anything but a &#8220;real-life anecdote,&#8221; as Perkins himself recently confessed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbp;.</p>
<p>If Perkins&rsquo;s intent was to spark a discussion, he succeeded. Virginia Law Weekly ran a companion piece to the letter in its April 22 edition, in which a reporter interviewed members of the faculty about the incident. Students discussed the story with one another, over lunch and at parties. {snip}</p>
<p>University officials conducted an investigation to get to the bottom of what happened. And here&rsquo;s what they found, according to UVA&rsquo;s recent press release {snip}:<blockquote>On May 5, after a thorough investigation into allegations that University of Virginia police officers had mistreated an African-American law student, the individual acknowledged that his story had been a fabrication.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wrote the article to bring attention to the topic of police misconduct,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;The events in the article did not occur.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>Wow  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s actually kind of impressive. Go back and read Perkins&rsquo;s letter. It&rsquo;s dramatic, describing the &#8220;two different worlds&#8221; that whites and African-Americans supposedly inhabit, and invoking the names of police brutality victims Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima. And it&rsquo;s detailed, with descriptions of how Perkins was supposedly manhandled by the officers, as well as lines of dialogue from the encounter (&#8220;Oh, he&rsquo;s a law student.&#8221;).</p>
<p>And to think that it was all made up. If this whole &#8220;law&#8221; thing doesn&rsquo;t work out for Perkins, he could explore a career as a novelist or screenwriter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen to Perkins? Will he be charged with filing a false report? Apparently not, according to the UVA press release:</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognize that police misconduct does occur,&#8221; [university police chief Michael Gibson] said. &#8220;Pressing charges in this case might inhibit another individual who experiences real police misconduct from coming forward with a complaint. I want to send the message just how seriously we take such charges and that we will always investigate them with care and diligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Johnathan Perkins won&rsquo;t face criminal charges as a result of his misrepresentations. But he will face the scorn and anger of UVA classmates and alumni. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perkins is set to graduate on May 22, despite the fact that he lied to the UVa Law community, the university community, Charlottesville, and Albemarle County. As the Honor Committee states, the three criteria of a violation are: act, intent, and seriousness. Perkins knew he was lying, acted upon that fabrication by sending the story to the Virginia Law Weekly and local media outlets, and the seriousness of the situation is exemplified by the internal investigation that was started and the widespread publicity the story got in the local media outlets. This conduct is a blatant and intentional violation of the honor code and should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>If the honor committee does not take action against this simply because Perkins is supposed to graduate in two weeks, it undercuts the entire Honor Code system at UVa. Should a UVa law student be immune from violating the honor code simply because he&rsquo;s so close to graduation? Of course not; this is a public and egregious violation of the honor code that brings shame on the entire UVa community and should be dealt with swiftly and justly, before Perkins is allowed to graduate, if he should be allowed to graduate at all.</p>

		<p>One obvious clue that his story was a hoax:  There was nobody else that could corroborate his story.</p>
<p>I am not 100% sure of what I&rsquo;m about to say.  We all know that witnesses in court that are sworn in can be charged and convicted of perjury if they lie on the stand, or in sworn testimony.  I think, but cannot say for sure, that, as officers of the judicial system of the state(s) in which they have passed the bar exam (by definition, that&rsquo;s what an attorney is), attorneys are assumed to be &#8220;under oath&#8221; for life.  Therefore, this about-to-be-minted lawyer, even though he got his little hoax in just before the &#8220;bell rang,&#8221; so to speak, is already going into his new profession with credibility issues.</p>

		<p>A: The staff of the Virginia Law Weekly should be denied diplomas for failing to do due dilligence before publishing a story they didn&rsquo;t actually know was factual.<br>
B: Is ANYONE not fully &#8220;aware&#8221; of the way Blacks see the world? I.E. As perpetual victims? Who is not aware of this and where do they live? I want to move there.<br>
C: Perkins should not only be expelled but not permitted to take the bar for a period of five years. There are requirements of &#8220;Good Character&#8221; in every jurisdiction that sanctions new lawyers and Perkins obviously fails this standard, even if he can pass the test, which most minorities fail to accomplish. Since it was not a violent offense five years is fair. Enough time for him to think about what he did while at the same time not ruining his life.</p>

<p>The classic case is, of course, the Duke lacrosse rape hoax:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the academics &hellip; There are at Duke &hellip; a coterie of dozens &hellip; You can put a number on it at Duke: 88 of roughly 500 members of the Arts and Sciences faculty &hellip; who signed an ad in the school paper &hellip; This ad presumed the lacrosse players guilty, applauded the protestors who had been carrying &lsquo;Castrate&rsquo; signs outside their house, applauded the protestors who had been nailing &ldquo;Wanted&rdquo; ads with the pictures of most of the lacrosse players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It [the 88&rsquo;s ad] pictured most of the white students at Duke generally as a bunch of racists &hellip; which was patently absurd. These are people who are wedded to the myth that the United States remains a terribly oppressive place where women and minorities, especially blacks, can&rsquo;t get a break where privileged males are looking for every chance they can get to rape or otherwise abuse poor blacks, especially females.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Not one professor in the entire Duke undergraduate faculty for more than six months EVER dissented from the poison spewed by the 88 and people like [English professor] Houston Baker and [Literature professor] Grant Farred.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>One has to wonder just how many of these &#8220;racist atrocities&#8221; that are committed against blacks turn out to be hoaxes.  I would guess a very sizable percentage.  This article has it wrong though, Perkins will face no &#8220;scorn from students and alumni&#8221; of UVA.  If anything he will be a favorite amongst the countless minority supremacist groups and their white leftist champions.  </p>
<p>This is a clear case of tyranny of the minority.  Blacks and other media championed minority groups can get away with making up stories of racist abuse while facing absolutely no repercussions when they are disproved.  </p>
<p>To this day Susan Smith is remembered and hated more for the fact that she blamed a black man than for drowning her kids.  </p>

		<p>I used to live in Charlottesville, and while I was there the city suffered a string of black on white racially motivated crimes. The victims were white University of Virginia students and the attackers were local residents, all black. The perps confessed to choosing their victims based on race. I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a sense of irony reading this story.</p>

		<p>I read about this on lucianne.com last week.  At the Univ of Virginia  &mdash;   used to be a fine university&hellip;&hellip;  fake but true&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.  what can you say?<br>
whatever has been done to us, through indoctrination, media, education, has so screwed up the vision of reality in our society, that we live in a harsher version than the the fiction writers of &#8220;1984&#8221; or &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; could envision.  The main difference is the violence is done by individuals condoned by government than actually done by the government for us.  In other words, the government has set us upon ourselves.  There isn&rsquo;t much left to do except experience the individual downfall of all of us&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  as we implode in slow motion&hellip;.</p>

<p>What happened is an angry black man was expressing lies regarding the university police. He should be charged with filing a false police report even though he will be graduating within 2 weeks.</p>

		<p>The original article is worth a look.  In it, I feared the tone of the article and comments would be lauding him for deftly fooling elite law students (UVA is one of the vaunted T14 law schools) or for being a good fiction writer (good enough to fool said students).  After all, law students and others who follow the legal profession aren&rsquo;t exactly known for their traditional values, and one would assume the general tone would be &#8220;at least he helped bring this serious problem to light.&#8221;</p>
<p>But no.  They seem about as hard on Perkins as most others (80% of those who asked if UVA should let him graduate answered No).</p>

The Illinois Bar denied Matthew Hale.</p>
<p><i>&hellip;Illinois Bar Committee on Character and Fitness rejected Hale&rsquo;s application for a license to practice law. Hale appealed, and a hearing was held on April 10, 1999.

		<p>If I were an attorney going up against Johnathan Perkins in any sort of trial, I&rsquo;d make sure the judge and jury had this information to discredit him.  He&rsquo;s a pro-active liar, who is willing to make up stories out of whole cloth merely for attention.  I frankly don&rsquo;t see how he could be acceptable for the Bar of any state (they all have official ethics qualifications).  </p>

		<p>If one wants to know how anti-white universities have become, look at the difference between Perkins and Alexandra Wallace at UCLA.  Miss Wallace quickly (and repeatedly) apologized for imitating Asian students who annoyed her at the library yet this did not stop the malice and death threats from the good liberals at UCLA.  </p>
<p>Perkins, who made up a story that sought to not only bring sympathy to himself but also denegrate the police force of Charlottesville is allowed to go under the false belief others who might actually suffer police misconduct won&rsquo;t come forward.  Using that logic, I guess I&rsquo;ll just accuse people I don&rsquo;t like of trying to kill me.  If the police believe me, I&rsquo;ll be able to make a personal enemy&rsquo;s life miserable.  If the police don&rsquo;t believe me, no harm no foul.  I won&rsquo;t be charged with filing a false report under the mythological fear that some unknown future citizen who actually has his life threatened won&rsquo;t go to the police for fear of being accused of lying.</p>

		<p>Black people love telling stories about their &#8220;experiences&#8221; which usually are LIES.  Black people will lie about anything even things that don&rsquo;t matter which is why trust between black people is very low.  They also have a need to be the centers of attention.  I&rsquo;m sure this black student has become popular in black circles because of this and will remain so for a while to come even though he lied.</p>

		<p>Liberals have long espoused the idea that it&rsquo;s okay to lie in order to make a point.  My first realization of this came when I heard some leftist say it wasn&rsquo;t really true that 1/4 of American women have been raped  &mdash;  as libs had for decades contended.  They just wanted to bring attention to sexual assault, they stated.  Blacks, of course, take any leniency on the part of white society to heart.  They have always wheedled the white man to get their way, and if society views them as victims, most of them are all too eager to accept the status.  Now, with Obama, they have the greatest example of all  &mdash;  a disingenuous, incompetent black who was elected President simply because he&rsquo;s black.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore, this about-to-be-minted lawyer, even though he got his little hoax in just before the &ldquo;bell rang,&rdquo; so to speak, is already going into his new profession with credibility issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubbish!  He has met the only standards required to be a successful American lawyer!<br>

you don&rsquo;t get it, do you, racists FORCED him to do those things. He will do fine. He will go far. He was only trying &#8216;raise awareness&rsquo; of white racism.</p>

		<p>Poster #8- God will help us all, IF WE HELP OURSELVES! We cannot sit around &amp; wait for the answers to come to us. The hypocrisy is all around us when it comes to race. I do not advertise for other controversial sites, but there are pro-White sites that tell of 40 years plus atrocities against our white brothers &amp; sisters. It is painful to read, but it is necessary to read. You have to put a name to a happy, full of life person who is taken from us at the hands of a hateful, blank-staring expressionless minority. Pedophiles &amp; child killers of any race deserve the worst punishment that can be inflicted here on Earth.</p>
<p>But getting back to my point. We must start taking up arms like our kinfolk did a hundred years ago. My ancestors are of Eastern &amp; Western Europ origin. They shared in the fight against other Whites. But these days it is becoming clearer that &#8220;most&#8221; of our enemies are from outside, but the most powerful are their enablers, and they are from within.</p>

		<p>All ethnic groups act in their own self interest; only Whites as a group are publicly punished for doing so openly.<br>
 In this case UVA cannot allow this incident to prevent this black from graduating lest they have fewer graduating black statistics than  hoped for.<br>
 Perkins speaks of the myth of equal protection under the law, yet he is receiving the benefit of that unequal protection since he was not suspended or expelled for his blatant lies; lies that should disqualify him from ever being a lawyer. Ever.<br>
E Pluribus Pluribis is right, Nazi&rsquo;s propaganda pales in comparison to the 88&rsquo;s ad&rsquo;s totalitarian oppression of White Folk.<br>
 Perkins will be well liked by black supremacist groups and jewish groups and will likely either get a government job or work with NAACP, SEIU, or ACLU. Most likely doing clerical work and possibly writing articles every now and then. They will listen to him, they will not hold his false anecdote against him, but he will be praised for &#8220;stickin&rsquo; it to Whitey&#8221;.<br>
 Perhaps I&rsquo;m cynically pessimistic, this place can do that to a person.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I recognize that police misconduct does occur,&rdquo; [university police chief Michael Gibson] said. &ldquo;Pressing charges in this case might inhibit another individual who experiences real police misconduct from coming forward with a complaint. I want to send the message just how seriously we take such charges and that we will always investigate them with care and diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us adjust, the statement above by Mr. Gibson as it should read: &ldquo;I recognize that blacks commit a great deal of crime in relation to their proportion and percentage of the population in America (www.vdare.com/taylor/050913_crime.htm) [university police chief Michael Gibson] said. &ldquo;Pressing charges in this case would just add to the higher percentage of crime committed by blacks since Mr. Johnathan Perkins is an African American.   I want to send the message just how seriously we investigate black crime and that we will always investigate black crime with care and diligence.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Olewhitelady. Liberals DO NOT own the corner on the lying phenomena. They just have a way of getting it publicized to fit their goals. Recently there wzs a Republican on Capitol Hill who claimed that Planned Parenthood&rsquo;s resources fund 90% of abortions. This was a flat out lie. Even his PR person came out and stated that the comment wasn&rsquo;t meant to be factual. What the hell is that even suppose to mean?</p>

<p>- How exactly is not pressing any charges sending the message of how seriously you take police misconduct complaints? Typical of modern day officials, the truth is the reverse. But of course the biggest insanity at play here is how anyone could believe blacks are the ones being treated as second class citizens when blacks continue to have to blatantly exaggerate, or in this case outright lie about mistreatment to be able to claim they were mistreated. And then, when they do, receive no punishment for their actions. A white law student making libelous statements would, at the very least, be expelled from law school, and likely would be sued by those he lied about. And lets not forget that filing false reports, presenting false testimony to police, potentially inciting violence (as blacks claiming mistreatment anywhere seem to commonly do nowadays), etc. are all criminal offenses.</p>
