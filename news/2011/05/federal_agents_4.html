<h1>Federal Agents Widen Chipotle Immigration Probe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Baertlein, Yahoo! News, May 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. immigration agents descended on Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants on Tuesday, interviewing employees in about two dozen outlets in Los Angeles, Atlanta and other cities.</p>
<p>Roughly 500 undocumented workers have been fired as a result of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audits of the popular burrito chain&rsquo;s hiring paperwork in Minnesota, Virginia and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the cities mentioned above, ICE agents also interviewed workers in Minnesota and Washington, D.C., said Robert Luskin, Chipotle&rsquo;s outside counsel and a partner at Patton Boggs in Washington.</p>
<p>Luskin said ICE gave Chipotle enough advance notice of the interviews by plain-clothed agents that the company had the opportunity to send a note to employees telling them it wanted them to cooperate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ENFORCEMENT SHIFT</p>
<p>U.S. immigration enforcement has shifted considerably in recent years. Notably, the Obama administration is cracking down on employers rather than illegal workers.</p>
<p>Carl Shusterman, a former prosecutor for ICE&rsquo;s predecessor agency, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, said interviews like the ones ICE conducted at Chipotle on Tuesday show how the administration is ratcheting up pressure.</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that advance notification of upcoming ICE interviews might scare off any undocumented workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Denver-based Chipotle has won plaudits from Wall Street for its seemingly uncanny ability to hold down labor costs. That ability has been a major factor behind its six-fold increase in share price since late 2008. Chipotle shares fell 2.4 percent Tuesday to $260.40.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Should the investigations uncover widespread disregard of immigration laws, co-chief executives Steve Ells and Monty Moran could face criticism for allowing the practice to spread through the 1,100-unit U.S. operation.</p>
<p>Unlike many rivals that sell franchises, Chipotle owns and operates its restaurants and is ultimately responsible for hiring.</p>

		<p>We are only allowing the fostering of a hostile and dangerously anti-White environment when we allow our Feds. to coddle the criminal illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Once they come to expect that kind of treatment, much as have all blacks by now, what do you think will happen to us if a real reformer comes along who has our backing and says No!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created an environment where patriotism is treason against multiculturalism and will not be tolerated.  </p>

<p>And this didn&rsquo;t raise any red flags?  Just like those mysterious year-over-year miraculous gains in student test scores at &#8220;bad&#8221; public schools?</p>
<p><i>Should the investigations uncover widespread disregard of immigration laws, co-chief executives Steve Ells and Monty Moran could face criticism for allowing the practice to spread through the 1,100-unit U.S. operation.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Could face criticism&hellip;practice to spread.&#8221;  I can think of something else that should &#8220;spread&#8221; in relation to these two, as a natural consequence of what should be a long Federal prison bid for these two, if there&rsquo;s any evidence they knowingly hired illegals or compelled a corporate climate that fostered the reckless disregard of immigration policies.</p>
<p>About a million people applied for 50,000 McDonalds jobs in their recent hiring campaign.  Of the 950,000 or so that won&rsquo;t get these jobs, I&rsquo;m sure plenty of them would like to work at Chipotle.  I&rsquo;m sure most of those are citizens.</p>

<p>In other words, the illegal invaders are free to walk across the street and apply at the McDonalds with no fear whatsoever of being arrested or deported. This is nothing more than window dressing! Wake me up when they conduct a similiar &#8220;crack down&#8221; in California, since the reconquista is almost complete here in Mexifornia. <br>

		<p>I used to eat there, before I woke up to the invasion. But I started getting sick there also. Most employees are 100% illegal, and barely speak a lick of english, and I doubt they have western hygiene.<br>
And chipotle always has a token white smilling idiot at the end of the line to take your money&hellip;putting a fake face of America on the operation.<br>
I hope they fold; they&rsquo;re a rat&rsquo;s nest of corruption and exploitation. May the company fold overnight!</p>

		<p>I disagree, somewhat,  with the misplaced focus here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that Mexicans and Moslems  aren&rsquo;t a problem. It&rsquo;s that they are not THE  problem.   Same with our blacks.  As has been said here before, there would be NO problem without the shadowy enablers standing behind them, always protecting them.</p>
<p>They could easily be dealt with.  We are still the majority. We have not only  the numbers, but the brains, the money, the technology, all all the advantages (though these are  rapidly being taken  from us) as well as the essential administrative and organizing skills which they totally lack; but our hands are tied by the enablers who coddle them and who forbid us to deal with the problem in any effective manner.  All of that subversion being done under  the lofty banners of Civil Rights,   Human Rights, social justice, and blah, blah, blah. </p>
<p>If given a free hand, and  a truly patriotic party in power, we could abolish Afirmative Action, close the border,  begin the deportations, clarify  the anchor baby confusion, outlaw  &#8220;hate speech&#8221; rules and racial quotas in universities and industry, abolish diversity training and diversity departments,  exit the foreign wars, limit the power of the courts to make their own legislation contrary to public will, and do  all (or most)  of this within a few months. Or at least get it well underway.    But because of the enablers, we cannot. They would have  hysterical fits, stage riots,  and would block us at every point with legal technicalities and  endless maneuvres and court cases that drag on for years.  That is their technique.  </p>
<p>A vigorous and patriotic government, if we had one, could put an end to all of that obstructionist nonsense with the stroke of a pen.  But we don&rsquo;t have such a government.</p>
<p><br>
As it is, we have an anti-white government that is not only slavishly  sensitive to all &#8220;minority&#8221; demands, but  coldly indifferent to majority  interests. It has a deaf ear to our concerns or even to our future on this continent.   It not  only discriminates against us at every turn, applauds our minoritization,  but is activey following policies that will irrevocably result in our physical replacement and destruction in the country that we founded and built &#8220;for our posterity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is there any more perfect description of treason in high places?</p>

		<p>  It&rsquo;s a real joke, as many &#8220;ethnic&#8221; restaurants hire bogus foreign workers, who are only seeking a green card. Of course, cheap subservient labor is also preferred in most of these Third World restaurants.  I&rsquo;m sure some restaurant owners are even paid to hire these immigration scofflaw: &ldquo;distant&#8221; relatives?</p>

<p>@ #1</p>
<p>Stop writing that WE created this.  We did not.</p>
<p>WE did not create this white hating environment, it was created for us by forces more powerful than we are and hostile to us and our interests.  I neither wanted nor asked for this, did you?  Previous generation were LIED to about the benefits of multi/culturalism and immigration, in the bad old days before the internet gave us the other side of the msm&rsquo;s lies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I disagree, somewhat, with the misplaced focus here.&#8221;</p>
<p>@  #6 ghw</p>
<p>You are someone who gets it.  </p>
<p>Our very powerful enemies have us over a barrel and call out their attack dogs in the media to paint us as deranged Nazis desirous of lynching blacks and other nonwhites if we show any signs of white solidarity.  If the white vote were to coalesce into a voting bloc, we would win ALL national and state elections and our enemies would be taken care of forthwith as ghw explains above.  This is why we are forced to act as individuals and told we have no culture to be proud of, while nonwhites are encouraged to celebrate theirs.</p>
<p>As someone wrote on another thread:  what is all this blather about the rise of a fearless white leader?  </p>
<p>The forces that own and run this country and plan a genocide for us would never allow it.</p>

		<p>To poster #1</p>
<p>I know it can be frustrating reading story after story  like the one above. I too, at times find myself overwhelmed, but I&rsquo;ve learned that optimism makes the best burden. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t busy your mind with the problem itself. Do busy your mind with the solution, instead. </p>
<p>In a left run government, our beliefs will never see the light. Everyone knows the right is the party of white. One day, it will be on that side, our leaders will rise. Once they&rsquo;ve risen, they can undo what mistakes the fools have done. But our leaders will do nothing until the right have won. For now, let them pander for every vote they can get. And let us do more then just wait and sit.</p>
<p>We all know the brain behind the left belongs to the whites and the mouth piece belongs to the minority. We need to find away to turn the mouth against the brain. It shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. </p>
<p>We know minorities are emotional and thus, predictable. We know diversity to them means less white or no whites at all. We know in many offices, cities, businesses and educational institutions, that white liberals comprise the majority. To us, this is common knowledge. With a little digging on the internet, it can be proven as fact. Facts all of us can push in to the conciseness of the mainstream minority. We can do this on You tube and in the forums where minorities frequent. We can do this anonymously. We can do it disguised as minorities (which is probably the best way). </p>
<p>We can also turn minority against minority. We know they don&rsquo;t get along and the archives here are filled with the reasons of why. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been vague, but hopefully you get the gist.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fight me if you&rsquo;re busy fighting yourself.</p>

<p>This is why wall street and the wealthy LOVE open borders and pressure the government to ignore illegal immigration. Never mind it long term destroys the country, they are too myopic and selfish to care. </p>

		<p>@6 GHW,</p>
<p>Which is why we must have a country of our own.  Because the shadowy enablers will make of us a target no matter what: high profile or silent majority.</p>
<p>But if we are to have a real hope of pursuing our own destiny as posterity we must necessarily also provide a bright shining example of how things can and should be done, for ourselves, by ourselves.</p>
<p>That example will never occur in the USA.  Hoping that the current owners will change or change their minds is like hoping that an abusive spouse will stop hurting you if only they see what damage they are doing to your love.</p>
<p>Of country, of nation, of heritage and people.</p>

		<p>ICE should investigate the GM of a Chipotle restaurant in Richmond <br>
Killing a illegal employee who was pregnant 8.5 months. Chipotle management<br>
Knowingly disregarded the employee and transferred her instead of firing the GM of the restaurant. Interesting point is no media in Richmond mentioned the case.  Powerful company, eh?</p>

		<p>I began boycotting chains such as Denny&rsquo;s and all fast food 30 years ago because they do nor hire White Americans.  I buy all my food at a California chain called Trader Joe&rsquo;s and a small market owned AND staffed by Persian immigrants.  </p>
<p>Trader Joe&rsquo;s is the only food market chain in California that hires Whites.  Unfortunately it pays minimum wage instead of the living wage paid by the large chains. But it is the only chain that hires Whites at all, so I patronize it.  One thing I like about the Persians other than their being White like me.  When they need help for their restaurants they actually put up a sign in English.</p>
<p>This is remarkable for 2 reasons;</p>
<p>(1)  They recruit help locally instead of telling an illegal immigrant to call their stone age Salvadorean village for another illegal.</p>
<p>(2) The sign is in English instead of Spanish.</p>
<p>About 2 years ago I was walking down  street and saw a help wanted sign in a restaurant window.  I was shocked.  It&rsquo;s been decades since I saw a help wanted sign outside a restaurant.  That is because all restaurant and food industry recruiting is done out of the country.</p>
<p>When friends want to get together for dinner I always ask them over for dinner.  I&rsquo;d rather do that than spend a dime in a business that hires immigrants rather than Native White Americans.</p>
