<h1><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/black-stars-celebrity-apprentice-urged-185885">Black Stars of &#8216;Celebrity Apprentice&rsquo; Urged to Denounce Donald Trump</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Miller, Hollywood Reporter, May 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An African-American political advocacy group is targeting Celebrity Apprentice star Donald Trump in the aftermath of what many feel are racially tinged political comments made about President Obama.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the organization ColorOfChange launched a Twitter-based campaign to persuade black Celebrity Apprentice cast members Star Jones and Lil Jon to denounce Trump for what the group terms &#8220;race-baiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first organized attempt to target these celebrities and demand that they, as prominent African-Americans, take a public stance against Donald Trump&rsquo;s ongoing attacks against President Obama,&#8221; ColorOfChange said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Groupon, the discount shopping website, pulled its online advertisements from the Celebrity Apprentice website last week after customers  &mdash;  spurred on by progressive advocacy group ThinkProgress  &mdash;  complained. Earlier this week, The Hollywood Reporter contacted nearly all of the companies that have recently aired advertisements on the long-running reality competition series to ask whether they might follow in Groupon&rsquo;s footsteps. Apprentice advertisers Kay Jewelers, Allstate, Microsoft and Procter &amp; Gamble declined to comment on their advertising plans, and more than 30 others did not respond to phone calls and emails.</p>
<p>Rashad Robinson, executive director of ColorOfChange, said the campaign has started strongly. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of people tweeting,&#8221; said Robinson, adding that the goal is to send a message to Jones, Lil Jon and other Celebrity Apprentice cast members that &#8220;they can&rsquo;t have a relationship with the black community and have a relationship with Trump and not call him out for his actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mainstream critics, including Bob Schieffer of CBS Evening News, have labeled Trump  &mdash;  who says he is mulling a run for president  &mdash;  a racist or expressed discomfort over his comments questioning Obama&rsquo;s citizenship. Trump, 64, has also questioned Obama&rsquo;s admission to Harvard Law School.</p>

		<p> What freedom of speech? Only if it doesn&rsquo;t rile up the totalitarian Left. Then, it will be labeled &#8220;hate speech,&#8221; as this preposterous ColorOfChange has done Trump&rsquo;s questioning of Obama&rsquo;s integrity, and the Left will try its best to silence it and stamp it out.</p>
<p> How unsure of its own foundations the Left and the militant blacks must be, if they feel compelled to shout down anyone who disagrees with them, in the fear that that person or group might start to gain some traction. Be afraid of the truth, Leftists; be very, very afraid.</p>

<p>Oh, of course Rashad! Yeah, you people get all your racial brothers and sisters to &#8220;tweet&#8221; and DEMAND this or that from anyone who is WHITE! </p>
<p>I have had it with all these articles we read and comment on and NOTHING has changed for us Whites whatsoever. It is only getting worse by the day. Then we have people like Tancredo and all Rino talk show hosts always saying &#8220;it isn&rsquo;t about race&#8221;!!  YES, IT IS! OUR race and it&rsquo;s survival in our own countries!</p>
<p>Does anyone here have any other options or advice on what WE can do to stop this insanity before we are all dead?  I am so weary of us not getting anywhere and I have been posting for about 9 years now and nothing has changed, it has only intensified with no end in sight.</p>

		<p>Rule of Thumb (if you understand this, you&rsquo;ll get along a lot better in life): Anytime you criticize a black for any reason whatsoever, your comments are &#8220;racially charged&#8221; and therefore &#8220;racist.&#8221; The sooner you understand that, the better. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the black happens to be President of the United States and holds the fate of millions of people in his hands, it&rsquo;s still racist. Got it? Good.</p>

		<p>Only in a society as demented as our&rsquo;s has become would Star Jones, Li&rsquo;l Jon (and Nene Leaks) be designated as &#8220;Stars&#8221;. This year&rsquo;s Apprentice show went out of its way to collect a bunch of freaks, has-beens, and never weres. The only redeeming feature of this edition was to highlight the brainless,time-wasting, and unending wrangles between Jones and Leaks, a preview, for those who can admit it, of what you get when you hire blacks.</p>

<p>Sir, you&rsquo;re exactly right, but don&rsquo;t lose heart. At some point, the minorities are going to go stark raving mad and attack the White people flat out. They have to. They have no choice. They can&rsquo;t allow us to stay amongst them. They may out number us at some point, but our people are so completely superior to them, we&rsquo;ll take care of them, even though we&rsquo;ll have great loses in the beginning because of how many White people have become so weak through years of brainwashing. But our nucleus of outstanding people is still there and just waiting for the time to settle accounts. I don&rsquo;t know what it will be that will set all this in  motion, but I assure you Sir, it is coming.</p>

		<p>The Color of Change is just black people saying and doing the same things, just under a new name. Same as the NAACP or any other black organization. If your white and dare question anything concerning blacks you are automatically labeled a racist. But it&rsquo;s OK to ask questions of other races.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just black peoples form of intimidation. Like the New Black Panthers standing at the polling site holding clubs. When they were approached by the media and asked why they were standing there holding clubs, they used their usual threats and intimidation tactics to get the media to leave. </p>
<p>The Black Panther incident got very little mass media attention. I saw it on the internet. But the lackeys of mass media will find time to publish the drivel we read above.</p>
<p>I, for one, am getting quite desensitized to the never ending nitpicking and complaining over the slightest and stupidest things by our black population and their so-called organizations. Their ignorant enablers, who give them a voice when not deserved and allow them to behave like children, are doing them the greatest diservice. And blacks are too self-centered to see it and the enablers are too busy sucking up to them to see the damage they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they have Donald Trump quaking in his boots (sarcasm-just in case you didn&rsquo;t know). Mr. Trump strikes me as the kind of gentleman that cannot be easily intimidated. Like myself. And I am sure a lot more white people are getting very fed up also. Why don&rsquo;t you try acting like adults? That would be a really big change!</p>

		<p>Back in the days when Trump&rsquo;s &#8220;Apprentice&#8221; didn&rsquo;t involve celebs, and actually involved relatively young and business savvy people who took the business world seriously, one of the first seasons&rsquo; two finalists was a black man, Kwame was his first name.  Trump didn&rsquo;t pick him in the finale, but remember that Trump has sole power to vote people off the island.  Trump can&rsquo;t be too much of a bigot to let a black man get that far into the competition.</p>

		<p>If the racist organization known as &#8220;Color Of Change&#8221; gets the two morons Star Jones and Lil John to denounce Donald Trump, all that&rsquo;s going to do is skyrocket Trump to the head of pack. The American people will not be fooled again. We have found  out the hard way that the very ones that bitch and moan about racism the most always turn out to be the biggest racists, bigots and hypocrites on the face of the planet.  </p>

		<p>Harvard Law School has no attrition and their Bar Review cherry picks blacks.  Also, Harvard has first pick of the best black pre-law students so Barak&rsquo;s being accepted shows only that he was likely one of the best BLACKS.  </p>
<p>Racial data from the LSAT shows the top 1% of blacks score 159 which is an average score for many Tier II law schools.  If BO had respectable credentials why wouldn&rsquo;t he release them?  I bet his LSAT &amp; bar score are nothing impressive. </p>

		<p>How is asking questions of our president racist? Anyone questioning any black for any reason or purpose is automatically accused of racism&hellip;get over and get on with life.</p>
<p>Do you believe any tv show could survive without star or lil jon (sorry I don&rsquo;t know who they are)?  </p>
<p>These organizations for the black race, the hispanic race, or any other specialized race club are racists by charter.  Why not bring back an all white self interest club?  Then watch the mental midgets howl.</p>
<p>By the way white people, your government hates you and does everything possible to denigrate and destroy your culture, your history, and your hope.  They want dummies and they&rsquo;re getting them by the millions.</p>

		<p>If a black man, with nominal control over some 5,000MT of thermonuclear destruction, thinks he has the right to hold back simple proof of his nation of birth, while _bowing_ to the Saudis who attacked this country on 9/11.</p>
<p>Then his religious ethics as much as his nationality in representing our interests should be what is questioned.</p>
<p>If the sophist liberal media think that the intelligence and agenda inherent to seeing a man&rsquo;s collegiate transcripts is &#8216;unimportant&rsquo; compared to the color of his skin, as we stand on the brink of one of the greatest ecnomic and financial crises ever faced by this nation.</p>
<p>Then they are the ones who are racist, not us.</p>
<p>I would recommend that all whites stop watching the MSM in protest but I believe that that is pretty much a given anyway.</p>

		<p>Blacks have groupthink and act in unified self-interest but that&rsquo;s not racist, it&rsquo;s only racist when White people do it.<br>
 Buy any normal definition colorofchange is a racist: race based group.<br>
Donald Trump is being attacked because he is a White. They say HE is &#8220;race-baiting&#8221;? What Hypocrites! Or they want a monopoly on who is allowed to sale racial things.</p>
