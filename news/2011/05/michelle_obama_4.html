			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Stevens, Daily Mail (London), May 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>First Lady Michelle Obama has invited a rapper who called for the burning of George Bush to perform at the White House.</p>
<p>Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr, who uses the stage name &#8216;Common&rsquo;, will be welcomed at an event celebrating American poetry on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He is expected to take part in rap workshops with schoolchildren in the afternoon before performing in the evening.</p>
<p>In footage on YouTube he is seen calling for the burning of the former president.</p>
<p>&#8216;Burn a Bush cos for peace he no push no button,&rsquo; the hip-hop artist raps in one video, which has more than 800,000 views.</p>
<p>Other song lyrics reportedly include threats to shoot the police.</p>
<p>The controversial rapper hails from President Obama&rsquo;s hometown Chicago and has also rapped about the former Illinois senator.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old featured in a video called &#8216;Yes We Can&rsquo;, which was made in support of Mr Obama&rsquo;s 2008 presidential election campaign.</p>
<p>&#8216;Common&rsquo;, who is a vegan, has won two Grammy awards for his music and has worked with artists including Kanye West.</p>
<p>President Obama and his wife Michelle will host the gathering of poets, musicians and artists at the White House on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Alexander, Billy Collins, Rita Dove, Kenneth Goldsmith, Alison Knowles, Aimee Mann and Jill Scott will also perform.</p>
<p>The White House said the readings and performances will highlight poetry&rsquo;s influence on American culture.</p>
<p>In 2009, Mrs. Obama inaugurated a White House music series that has celebrated jazz, country, classical, Motown and Latin music.</p>
<p>She has also arranged salutes to Broadway, the music of the civil rights movement and Judith Jamison, an Alvin Ailey dancer and artistic director.</p>

						<p><small><em>Neil Munro, Daily Caller, May 9, 2011</em></small></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Back in 2003, First Lady Laura Bush held a poetry evening, and she invited several poets to reprise the work of Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes and Walt Whitman. Although none of those poets had urged violence against a president, Bush canceled the event after left-of-center poets protested and threatened to disrupt the event.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of Dickinson&rsquo;s work that could have been presented at Bush&rsquo;s event:<br>
<blockquote><br>
I&rsquo;m nobody! Who are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nobody! Who are you?</p>
<p>Are you nobody, too?</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a pair of us  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t tell!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d banish us, you know.</p>
<p>How dreary to be somebody!</p>
<p>How public, like a frog</p>
<p>To tell your name the livelong day</p>
<p>To an admiring bog!</blockquote></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of Common&rsquo;s work, transcribed from a 2007 video with 837,613 viewers on YouTube. Students, please compare and contrast the two poems. You&rsquo;ll get extra credit for counting the death threats. There is no extra credit for identifying spelling errors. By the way, &#8216;Uzi&rsquo; is slang for a compact machine gun:</p>
<blockquote>A Letter to the Law
<p>Dem boy wanna talk&hellip; [indistinguishable]</p>
<p>Whatcha gon do if ya got one gun?</p>
<p>I sing a song for the hero unsung</p>
<p>with faces on the mural of the revolution</p>
<p>No looking back cos&rsquo; in back is what&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>Tell the preacher, God got more than one son</p>
<p>Tell the law, my Uzi weighs a ton</p>
<p>I walk like a warrior,</p>
<p>from them I won&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>On the streets, they try to beat us like a drum</p>
<p>In Cincinnati, another brother hung</p>
<p>A guinea won&rsquo;t see the sun</p>
<p>with his family stung</p>
<p>They want us to hold justice</p>
<p>but you handed me none</p>
<p>The same they did to Kobe and Michael Jackson</p>
<p>make them the main attraction</p>
<p>Turn around and attack them</p>
<p>Black gem in the rough</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re rugged enough</p>
<p>Use your mind and nine-power, get the government touch</p>
<p>Them boys chat-chat on how him pop gun</p>
<p>I got the black strap to make the cops run</p>
<p>They watching me, I&rsquo;m watching them</p>
<p>Them dick boys got a lock of cock in them</p>
<p>My people on the block got a lot of pok* in them</p>
<p>and when we roll together</p>
<p>we be rocking them to sleep</p>
<p>No time for that, because there&rsquo;s things to be done</p>
<p>Stay true to what I do so the youth dream come</p>
<p>from project building</p>
<p>Seeing a fiend being hung</p>
<p>With that happening, why they messing with Saddam?</p>
<p>Burn a Bush cos&rsquo; for peace he no push no button</p>
<p>Killing over oil and grease</p>
<p>no weapons of destruction</p>
<p>How can we follow a leader when this a corrupt one</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s a g-unit and they might buck young black people</p>
<p>Black people In the urban area one</p>
<p>I hold up a peace sign, but I carry a gun.</p>
<p>Peace, ya&rsquo;ll.&#8221;</blockquote></p>

		<p>Michelle&rsquo;s racism and lack of class were obvious and on full display during the campaign, and yet many whites still voted for her husband.  Apparently, they felt that uncouthness doesn&rsquo;t matter when it comes to blacks, and thus we have a First Lady who&rsquo;s like something out of a blaxploitation flick.</p>

		<p>If white people refused to give over their wealth for redistribution via welfare, would this person exist?  By that, would he &#8220;be somebody&#8221; with money and the ability to influence others.</p>
<p>My opinion is no.  And that there are no race problems in the world.  No immigration problems.  Not even a drug problem.</p>
<p>The world has a welfare problem. Those other things begin and end with welfare.  Dismantle welfare tomorrow and the world will rapidly start to become what it was prior to welfare.  A white dominated world with our numbers rapidly multiplying with peace and the rule of law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.  The solution.  It can either be imposed from without.  In other words, revolution followed by a totalitarian white system that refuses to give one red cent to non-whites.  Or from within.  Make the knowledge that welfare and charitable giving IS the source of ALL the world&rsquo;s problems when it is allowed to cross racial barriers&hellip;..so people resist.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The First Lady reveals her idea of high culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting her obvious lack of intelligence in so many respects, it isn&rsquo;t surprising she would think such mindless, childish drivel is poetry.</p>
<p>Everything she promotes she does so because she perceves it beneficial to blacks.  For example, leftist Marxists hell-bent on destroying the country from within are telling blacks their low I.Q.&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t really mean anything, because environment and diet can increase intelligence.  </p>
<p>So this pitiful mentally challenged wonk pushes throughout the country for better diets.  She knows that obesity is rampant among black students, so she advocates exercise, exercise, exercise.</p>
<p>If she were to be successful by causing an improvement in black diets and a reduction in fat blacks, I wonder who she will blame when tests prove blacks haven&rsquo;t increased in I.Q. scores one iota?</p>

		<p>Is anyone surprised by this? Michelle and Barrack are both anti-White, anti-America and anti-Christian so what is new? I believe her thesis at Princeton told us how she felt about White people. Barracks &#8220;Dreams Of My Father&#8221; told us the same thing. </p>

		<p>When a white person makes any kind of negative statement regarding a black (no matter how true) it is called RACISM.<br>
But there is a black preacher on youtube who tells it like it is. He calls Obama &#8220;Long Legged Mack Daddy&#8221; and he thinks little of Obama and doesn&rsquo;t hide it. Check him out I wish he posted on AmRen the guy is good.</p>

		<p>From what we&rsquo;ve seen of the Obama administration&rsquo;s social circle, &#8220;Common&#8221; may outclass all of them. I think it is absurd to expect the Obama administration to rub elbows with anyone you would trust around children. When your Czar of safe schools is a homosexual pedaphile who wrote the forward to the book &#8220;Queering elementary education&#8221;, what standards could you possibly expect. Say what you will about &#8220;Common&#8221; and his chestpounding uneducated ramblings from the gutter. He&rsquo;d have to get up pretty early in the morning to raise an eyebrow in the Obama administration. Of course we are all continually shocked by these types. If you think of the American left as the further expansion of the red light district, everything makes perfect sense. From the homosexual pedaphile to the welfare born gang member to the communists, they all have one thing in common. These are people that white America would rather have quarantined off from our society.</p>

<p>&#8220;pok* in them&#8221;  That is incorrect, he is saying</p>
<p>&#8220;Pac in them&#8221; meaning 2-Pac the militant rapper.</p>
<p>When he said &#8220;Burn a Bush cos&rsquo; for peace he no push no button&#8221;</p>
<p>He is saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot George Bush because so he won&rsquo;t push the button (nuke)&#8221;</p>
<p>He used a deep slang way to call for the death of George Bush which  is illegal.</p>
<p>Guns are commonly called &#8220;burners&#8221; which are taken from the old Italian Mafia slang for a gun from the 1920&rsquo;s.  &#8220;burn [someone]&#8221; means &#8220;shoot them&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In all fairness to Ms. Obama, she probably was unaware of the rapper&rsquo;s background. She is a 47 year old woman who probably does not listen to that much rap music.</p>
<p>I remember in 1985 when someone on President Reagan&rsquo;s staff  invited two nazi sympathizers to a ceremony honoring World War II veterans. After an outcry from various quarters, the administration quickly apologized for the misstep.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the castrating first lady or her grinning idiot husband; however, I do know that sometimes people are not always aware of every individuals background, especially at that level.<br>

		<p>Ezra Pound defines poetry as &#8220;news that stays news&#8221; and, like it or not, that is the standard by which &#8220;Common&rsquo;s&#8221; verse must be judged.  It is a necessary sophistication of modern criticism that a writer&rsquo;s work be studied without reference to biography or religion.  What is &#8220;Ode on a Thousand Yard Stare&#8221; to me, may be something more expressive for you.  If you want to try black writing that at times reaches the poetic level, try Jean Toomer&rsquo;s &#8220;Cane.&#8221;</p>
<p>My local library has a nice collection of good, old books but wisely secrets them in non-circulating stacks lest the unwary accidentally read one. Who knows how many copies of C.P. Snow have been stolen by the homeless?  It now takes eight dollars in gas for me to get to a so-called book store and back.  So, I&rsquo;ve been buying used hardbacks from Amazon for about ten bucks each.  It makes one feel good.  Resist Kindle.  It is Satan&rsquo;s work.      </p>

<p>Not true. Her husband&rsquo;s Ipod choices are routinely in the media. His musical stylings run from hip-hop to R&B; with nary a non-black artist or musical style in the mix. Chances are Michelle is listening to the same music such as Jay Z, Kanye West and Beyonce. Common is in that same circle (all the black music basically sounds the same anyway).</p>

		<p>So this rubbish is &#8216;poetry&rsquo; eh? Not only that, we have workshops for youngsters so as to instill and continue this revolting &#8216;moronification process&rsquo; which is not just sweeping the USA, but the entire world.</p>
<p>I remember T.S. Eliot from high school, a little pessimistic and  rather profound, yet it made a person (a teenager) think. I liked it so much, I bought a book of his. Maybe he was a sub-standard character; I didn&rsquo;t know. What does this idiotic hip-hop do to a teenager&rsquo;s brain? What may the end result be; violence, drug abuse, drug-dealing, pimping out bit**es, killing police&hellip;need I go on.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m old enough to remember when Jackie Kennedy brought the great Spanish cellist Pablo Casals for a famous White House concert. Of course, our current president has already indicated his musical preference for Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and other contemporary rap &#8220;artists.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s nice to see that we&rsquo;re making real progress in our cultural development.</p>

		<p>I expected this sort of thing when Obama was sworn into office and his choice of a black minister gave a convocation that included the hope that America would become a country where &#8220;if you&rsquo;re mellow, it&rsquo;s yellow, if you&rsquo;re brown, stick around, and if you&rsquo;re black, it&rsquo;s laid back&#8221; &hellip;.at the Presidental Inauguration this shallow no-class reading was given over world wide news.</p>

		<p>To say that the First Lady, the Pres., Holder, and all the rest are planning all these things is laughable.  As some one else said, I believe on AmRen, &#8220;can you imagine these people actually sitting around, discussing how to do all these things.&#8221;  It is ridiculous!!</p>

<p>Common, Ice Cube, and Dr. Dre are respectively 39, 41, and 46 years old.  They&rsquo;re from the same generation as Michelle.  And yes many, if not most, blacks in this age bracket are listening to this stuff.  They don&rsquo;t like &#8220;white&#8221; music any more than they like &#8220;white&#8221; movies.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Not true. Her husband&rsquo;s Ipod choices are routinely in the media. His musical stylings run from hip-hop to R&B; with nary a non-black artist or musical style in the mix. Chances are Michelle is listening to the same music such as Jay Z, Kanye West and Beyonce. Common is in that same circle (all the black music basically sounds the same anyway).&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think your lily white teenage sons and daughters listen to on their I-pods? I bet it&rsquo;s not Beethoven or Ravi Shankar. </p>

		<p>My gut feeling is that your president is doing some &#8220;fence mending&#8221;, as politicians call it, with his black constituents. Obama is trying to convince them that he belongs to their group by embracing a distinctive aspect of black American culture. This will hopefully offset the economic and social damage his immigration policies will inflict on Obama&rsquo;s brothas and sistas. </p>

I expected this sort of thing when Obama was sworn into office and his choice of a black minister gave a convocation that included the hope that America would become a country where &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re mellow, it&rsquo;s yellow, if you&rsquo;re brown, stick around, and if you&rsquo;re black, it&rsquo;s laid back&rdquo; &hellip;.at the Presidental Inauguration this shallow no-class reading was given over world wide news.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re mellow, it&rsquo;s yellow,&#8221; etc. are actually a take-off from an old song, can&rsquo;t remember if was blues or folk. It&rsquo;s, &#8220;If you&rsquo;re White, you&rsquo;re alright. If you&rsquo;re brown, stick around. If you&rsquo;re black, get back, get back, get back.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Common is on our side. He is adamantly against interracial marriage. What I read here sounds like a Hannitu/Limbaugh show. I have said this many times. Our greatest threat is not from the Dems who are honest where they stand. The so-called Conservatves and their spokeman are far worst. They lull into thinking something is being done for our people,when really they are shills for the trans national corporations who are greatest enemies. </p>

<p> I agree with you that Casals was a leftist, anti-Franco pink, but he was a great cellist none the less. I admire him for his playing not his politics. Janos Starker, Yo Yo Ma and the late Gregor Piatrigorsky are also top drawer string musicians. The current &ldquo;artists&rdquo; invited to the White House reflect the cultural aspirations of our President and First Lady. </p>

		<p>NJ State Police &#8220;Outraged&#8221; Over Rapper Invite to White House Thursday, May 12, 2011 </p>
<p>Despite controversy, rapper Common performed at the White House.</p>
<p><br>
The invitation of rapper Common to the White House this week is drawing the ire of the union representing New Jersey state police.</p>
<p>While even casual hip-hop fans wouldn&rsquo;t characterize him as a controversial rapper, Common found himself under the microscope after First Lady Michelle Obama invited him to the White House for an arts event. In question: the lyrics to &#8220;A Song for Assata,&#8221; about convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Assata Shakur.</p>
<p>The White House said Wednesday it stood by the decision to invite Common. Press Secretary Jay Carney said the conservative backlash distorts what Common stands for, and added that the president appreciates Common&rsquo;s work with children in Chicago.</p>
<p>FOX News and Sarah Palin condemned the decision after the Daily Caller published some of Common&rsquo;s lyrics, including some that criticize former President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>For New Jersey police, the outrage centers on &#8220;A Song for Assata&#8221; lyrics like &#8220;Your power and pride is beautiful. May God bless your soul&#8221;  a song praising Shakur  </p>
<p> Shakur, formerly known as Joanne Chesimard, was convicted for the 1973 slaying of Trooper Werner Foerster on the New Jersey Turnpike. She escaped prison in 1979, and is living in asylum in Cuba.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young people who read this stuff, hear this stuff, are getting a very dangerous and deadly message,&#8221;  David Jones, president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association union, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After the union made the case on Tuesday, the New Jersey State Police itself issued a statement on the controversy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot dictate who is invited to the White House, but we will always view Joanne Chesimard as a fugitive who killed one of our own,&#8221; Major Gerald Lewis, spokesman for the state police said in a statement. &#8220;We will continue our pursuit of her until she is brought to justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Known for being more of a brainy poet type than a thug or a gangster, Common seemed to be amused by the dust-up Tuesday, tweeting and retweeting the various news items, such as FOX News&rsquo; description of him as a &#8220;vile rapper.&#8221; </p>
<p>He also tweeted, &#8220;So apparently Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn&rsquo;t like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House appearance comes during the same week that lawmen from across the nation, including Jones, make their annual trek to Washington to honor their fallen comrades at the National Law Enforcement Memorial.</p>
<p>Sal Maggio, a retired troop commander with the state police, said his colleagues still talk about Shakur and the million dollar bounty the FBI has put on her capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully someday she&rsquo;ll be caught,&#8221; Maggio said in reaction to news of this invitation.</p>
<p>Common, who is also a successful actor, is known as one of the most lyrically poetic rappers. Last month he appeared in Chicago for a charity event for his foundation, honoring legendary author and poet Maya Angelou.</p>
<p><br>
Neither Jones nor Maggio believe the president or first lady are fully aware of Common&rsquo;s song about Shakur, though the rapper did appear at campaign events for Obama when he ran for president.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the president and first lady,&#8221; said Maggio. &#8220;I think he&rsquo;s doing a pretty good job lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>A representative for Common could not be reached.<br>
