			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Harry Bradford, Huffington Post, May 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Of all the disastrous consequences of the economic crisis, perhaps the most devastating is the idea of even more Americans struggling to feed their families. </p>
<p>Recent statistics from the USDA indicate that 14.2 percent of the U.S. population was using food stamps in February 2011, or around 44.2 million total, up from 33 million just two years before in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2006, the year before the financial crisis, 26.5 million people participated in the program, officially titled the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>States with smaller populations participate in food stamp programs most often, particularly in the South, where as many as 20 percent of the population is found to use food stamps.<br>

<p>Actually, we&rsquo;re always number one, here in Mississippi (whenever it&rsquo;s something bad).  Possibly, that&rsquo;s because we have the lowest average IQ (guess why that is).  But don&rsquo;t worry: the rest of America is dumbing-down to match Mississippi.  Pretty soon, you guys can ALL be Number One as often as are we.</p>

		<p>I would like to see some sort of an agreement made with Mexico that for every Illegal in America they would need to take one of our blacks.<br>
Mexico would see a wonderful change as the black geniuses raise the living standard of everyone.<br>
Business, Inventions, Outreach Programs just as in America the blacks we sent would be a blessing to Mexico and the United States. As you know blacks feel they owe white folks for the 600,000 who died in the Civil War so they could be free. And FREE seems to be their main interest on all levels.</p>

		<p>Falcon, welcome to Amren.  To answer your question, I would point out that Amren is a forum for generally like-minded traditionalist or conservative, racially aware people, interested in supporting and reestablishing Western civilization.  Most folks here, even non-religious people like myself, recognize the essential role that Western religions have played in our history and as foundations for the morality that we all share.  At best, critical comments about religion quickly degenerate into ad hominem attacks, since despite what most atheists seem to believe, religious questions cannot be resolved by either facts or reason.<br>
Attempts to have such &#8220;debates&#8221; are in very poor taste when among supposed allies, serving only to cause strife and dissention.  As such, most people quickly recognize such posters as trolls, and fortunately, Amren moderates the posts to weed out such beasts.</p>

		<p>Falcon,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell unless it&rsquo;s contextually relevant to the article at hand.</p>
<p>There are at least a couple of us (myself included) here who believe that trans-racial, cultural, indoctrination in religions which require submission to a guilted altruism theme or an absolutism of theocratic obeissance is dangerous and &#8216;accepting&rsquo; these faiths in others as having a natural right to exist in our society has degraded natural western cultural safeguards and white racial awareness in particular.</p>
<p>Others are very much Christian Conservatives and we tend to respect that because they tend to hold true to certain family and social values that are consistently sane as much as pro-Western.</p>
<p>We leave Jewish issues to other sites (Kevin MacDonald has a blog, if that&rsquo;s your belief orientation) as there are some quite intelligent and generally conservative members of that faith who contribute here.</p>
<p>There are also Indian, Australian and South African posters, along with the occasional European (their censors are pretty strict, Gates of Vienna is one Euro-site alternative).</p>
<p>I also recommend VDARE for specific immigration issues and good political and economic analyses.</p>
<p>We try to hold to a civil discourse, no matter what one&rsquo;s race, religion or nationality.  You may not get a response but nobody will be overtly rude to you.</p>
<p>If you can keep to that outline understanding with useful dialogue or personal experiences, you&rsquo;re good.  It&rsquo;s not a very pretty world right now and it&rsquo;s going to get worse, nobody expects you to be anything but truthful.</p>
<p>You can also contribute news articles for consideration, directly via link or at the main site header.</p>

<p>Just add twice that in actual pay for hours worked and its a government job.  But as long as something valuable is being done by the recipient, I don&rsquo;t think that is a bad thing at all.  It probably gives some sense of pride to the recipient as well.  I wonder what happened to the idea of having low risk, honor farm type prisoners work on farms?</p>

		<p>I am not one bit surprised that welfare and food stamps are given to blacks, and mexicans are actively trying to game and drain the system. It has been a concerted effort to destroy that system. The numbers have ben exploding, likely one factor is the depression. Whites tend to be discriminated against for such assistance. <br>

the posting guidelines protect us from muslims and raving lunatic liberals.. Many WN&rsquo;s are disbelievers of religion. I would like to know, if you have heard of kinism? Many of us see that modern mainstream churches no longer teach traditional values, but &#8220;diversity&#8221; and crap like that. Even the Catholic church ever since the &#8220;vatican II&#8221; thing in &#8216;65. So I would say that dislike of modern race mixing churches would be well received here.</p>

<p>I can totally relate to that statement. Going to mainstream churches opened my eyes after a few years. Listening to Christian radio and watching the TV gurus have reaffirmed &#8220;that something is not right here&#8221;. It is like they have climbed aboard the anti-White bandwagon.</p>
<p> Miscegenation is even accepted and interracial adoptions will give you the award of the year in most churches. They even embrace homosexual clergy and practicing homosexuals as &#8220;hate the sin, but love the sinner&#8221;. Where in the world does the Bible say that? Toleration of ALL things has become the norm. They have gone the way of the world and I see no hope of them ever returning to sanity.</p>

<p>They are not clients and they are not participating. Is is only when the harsh reality that they are supplicants for charity is brought home to them that there is a small hope of them.

		<p>It is not all non-whites who scam the system; some of us are young, white women who have found themselves unwanted by their partners, and have no chance to survive without the help. I just submitted my own application for food stamps, and I need to go to the Dept. of Transitional Assistance for my area to apply for housing and income assistance. My place of work has been very understanding, and has pledged to help me with extra hours, but still, mine is very difficult and emotionally painful predicament without being judged by the readers of Amren.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not against people being able to use food stamps if they really have a need but they really should give people some incentive to improve themselves so they can get off the dole.  They should restrict what kind of food items they can purchase. No junk food, candy, chips, gum, luxury items like filet mignon, lobster or imported cheeses, no processed foods like cake mixes, frozen french fries, hot pockets or meals in a bag.  You want dessert?  You buy a bag of flour, eggs and some sugar and make one.  I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything cruel about it and it would probably save quite a bit of money for the government and they could cut the food stamp allowance.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;I have given my life to try to alleviate the sufferings of Africa.  There is something that all White men who have lived here like I must learn and know:   that these individuals are a sub-race.   They have neither the intellectual, mental or emotional abilities to equate or share equally with White men in any functions of our civilisation. I have given my life to try to bring unto them the advantages which our civilisation must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status:  White the superior, and they the inferior.  For whenever a White man seeks to live among them as equals, they will either destroy or devour him.   And they will destroy all of his work, and so for any existing relationship or for any benefit to his people, let White men, from anywhere in the world, who would come to help Africa remember that he must continually retain this status:   you are the master, and they the inferior children that you would help or teach.   Never fraternize with them as equals.   Never accept them as your social equals or they will devour you.  They will destroy you.&rdquo; </p>

<p>One of the strengths of the race realist movement is that we are on the side of empirical truth. Thus it behooves us not to post any fraudulent or misrepresented material. The quote you attributed to Albert Schweitzer (&#8220;I have given my life to try to alleviate the sufferings of Africa&hellip;.. &#8220;) is probably fraudulent. Nobody has ever been able to show an actual published source. I found that it was attributed (without any proof or any designated specific source) to Schweitzer in a British racialist publication, the October 1975 issue of Spearhead. Does anyone know of any earlier source or any actual evidence that the quote originated from Schweitzer???? Until there is some actual proof that Schweitzer wrote this, we should stop claiming that this quote is from Schweitzer. </p>
