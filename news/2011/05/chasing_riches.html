<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/world/europe/26migrants.html">Chasing Riches From Africa to Europe and Finding Only Squalor</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Daley, New York Times, May 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The political upheaval in Libya and elsewhere in North Africa has opened the way for thousands of new migrants to make their way to Europe across the Mediterranean. {snip}</p>
<p>Experts say thousands more  &mdash;  many of whom have been moving around North Africa trying to get to Europe for years, including Somalis, Eritreans, Senegalese and Nigerians  &mdash;  are likely to follow, sure that a better life awaits them. </p>
<p>But for Mr. Jallow and for many others who arrived before them, often after days at sea without food or water, Europe has offered hardships they never imagined.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The authorities estimate that there are perhaps 10,000 immigrants living in the woods in the southern Spanish province of Andalusia, a region known for its crops of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. {snip}</p>
<p>Up close, the squalor is clear. Piles of garbage and flies are everywhere. Old clothes, stiff from dirt and rain, hang from branches.</p>

		<p>How many times do we have to see 3rd world immigrants who bring their cultures of ghetto/barrio living WITH them. I have seen over and again, block after block, of once very nice apartment complexes AND homes turn into places of destruction before my very eyes. I have lived in some of those complexes in the past when it was mostly filled with White people and the transformation is now totally unrecognizable. Once green grass now turned to dirt and garbage strewn everywhere. Once nice flower beds, shrubs are now all trampled and gone. </p>

		<p>Oh, but you&rsquo;re missing the best quotes!</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
PALOS DE LA FRONTERA, Spain  &mdash;  Back home in Gambia, Amadou Jallow was, at 22, a lover of reggae who had just finished college and had landed a job teaching science in a high school.</p>
<p>In his West African homeland, Mr. Jallow&rsquo;s salary was the equivalent of just 50 euros a month, barely enough for the necessities, he said. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
After 40 days in a detention center in the Canary Islands he was brought to the mainland and released with a standard order to leave the country. &ldquo;I thought I was going to be a millionaire,&rdquo; Mr. Jallow said. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
In the six years he has lived in Spain, Mr. Jallow has found temporary work in restaurants or in the fields, sometimes making 30 euros, or about $42, for 10 hours of work. He says he has made about 12,000 euros, close to $17,000, since coming to Europe, and sent maybe a third of it home. He has not talked to his family in months because he has no money. <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>So in two days, in a place where he knows he&rsquo;s not wanted, he makes more than he does in a month at home.  And knowing this, he says he&rsquo;d rather die than leave, even though he _knows_ he was supposed to head back.  And has done, for years.</p>
<p>And the farmers set up giant screen televisions so that they can watch the world cup&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait until the first crop of fruit comes up diseased with something out of West Africa and nobody catches it until dozens are sick.</p>

		<p>Andalucia, Andalucia, probably the most romantic and most interesting area of Spain. Home of the Alhambra in Granada and the Semana Santa(Holy Week)and la Feria in Sevilla. Andalucia what foreigners envision when they think of Spain. Going down the tubes like everything else. </p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll finish my bottle of wine and cry myself to sleep. I really can&rsquo;t take much more. </p>
<p>Before I do that though, I need to point out to the idiot NYT reporter that it&rsquo;s not a province, it&rsquo;s a REGION made up of 8 provinces. Where does the NYT find these imbeciles?     </p>

		<p>The New York Times has always been liberal, but it used to be responsible. This article demonstrates the new New York Times.</p>
<p>If people commit crime i.e. illegally entering a country, why are they not responsible for any injury they experience. These &#8220;migrants&#8221; are invaders. They have no rights, and normal governments would use what means were necessary to remove and/or eliminate them.</p>
<p>The Times&rsquo; reporting of this invasion is strictly from the point of view of the invaders: They come for a better life, Europe offers hardships they never imagined. The hardships imposed on law abiding citizens of the invaded countries is irrelevant (to the new New York Times).This article proves the Times antagonism to Western civilization. I am disgusted.</p>

		<p>I keep wondering why the terms migrant and immigrant are used to describe illegal aliens. These people are deliberately breaking the law, but no mention of that in the article. If they are living near farms it is an easy guess that they are trespassing and eating the crops.</p>

These sentences could be copy/pasted into an article about the US/Mexico border, where for several decades illegals by the hundreds of thousands have been trashing the desert environment faster than the authorities can clean it up. </p>
<p>The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from this is: </p>
<p>Third World people = Third World trash problems, Third World environmental destruction, and Third World &#8220;squalor.&#8221; </p>
<p>Only a moron or a NY Times reporter would try to deny the 100% correlation between the two. </p>

		<p>And like Rhodesia, which also was once a fruitful nation of suppliers to European supermarkets, this productive area will become a wasteland as the invaders make it too unsafe for indigenous Europeans to work the fields, as they are afraid of being raped: </p>

		<p>I am reading a book called &#8220;The Bilderberg Group&#8221; by Daniel Estulin.  It describes all the little roundtable groups, of which the Bilderberg Group is most influential.  These groups are composed of a superclass of multimillionaires and billionaires who are titans of industry, banking, media, and social engineering.  They are also the primary guiding force behind multiculturalism and the destruction of white Europe.  They advocate the use of extreme liberalism to create social chaos.  If the citizens are busy trying to live in this chaos, they are much less likely to notice this batch of criminals while they steal our wealth and rape us with impunity as well as destroy our societies by merging all cultures in the interest of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s strange that none of this planning strategy is ever addressed.  Is it because it&rsquo;s unknown?  Or is it known but not understood?  Is it (of course) &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; - unless the man on the TV news says it, it can&rsquo;t be happening?  We all know the mainstream news hides a lot of truth.  If these roundtable groups are responsible for the liberal policies that are wrecking our societies, why aren&rsquo;t more people exposing them?  </p>

<p><br>
Precisely that is happening right now. In today&rsquo;s news is this item:</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;Small numbers of Spanish vegetables suspected of contamination with a potentially deadly bacteria are being recalled from stores in Austria and the Czech Republic to prevent the spread of an outbreak that <b>has killed at least nine people and sickened hundreds across Europe, </b> officials said Sunday.  &hellip; officials said 120 organic Spanish cucumbers suspected of contamination by a potentially fatal bacteria were being pulled off shelves.<br>
 <br>
The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety said it had issued an immediate recall of the cucumbers that also applies to tomatoes and eggplants.The cucumbers transited Germany, where at least nine people have died and almost 300 have been sickened by hemolytic uremic syndrome. HUS is a rare complication arising from infection associated with the E. coli bacterium.<br>
 <br>
Almost a dozen people with HUS have been hospitalized in Sweden in the past two weeks after travel to Germany. In Denmark, eight people are hospitalized with E.coli infection that could be linked to the outbreak&hellip;.two greenhouses in Spain that were identified as the source of the contaminated cucumbers have ceased activies. The water and soil there are being analyzed to see whether they were the problem, or if the contamination occured elsewhere. <br>
 <br>
The EU notified member states of the source of the outbreak, which has affected primarily the Hamburg area of Germany and, to a lesser extent, Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.</i><br>

<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet 50% or more of all non-whites in countries like the US and UK receive discount, if not free, housing, food stamps, benefits. These aid agencies are openly discriminating against native whites. The media and educators will turn this into &#8216;proof whites and their evil societies are discriminating&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>The best thing that these bronze (or stone) age cultures had going for them was colonialism. Where the people remained in their own native region and enjoyed their own culture with the addition of many of the stronger benefits of a more advanced culture, i.e. public health, judiciary, law enforcement, medicine, agriculture, infrastructure etc. This is a method that has been in place since before the Roman empire. Yet it has been abandoned since the 1950s for reasons of &#8220;social justice&#8221; and because the international leftist press and propaganda say it should be so.</p>
<p>North African Arabs in Egypt have not governed themselves since the Ptolemaic kingdoms were established by the Greeks thousands of years ago. After Greece there was Rome, Then the Turks, then France, then England. You can see the descent into the pit happening before your eyes as the vestiges of colonial rule are erased in Egypt now. </p>
<p>The Chinese are bringing colonialism back to Africa as well as any other part of the world they can get their hands on, shouldn&rsquo;t the rest of us bring it back too. The people in these places will be much the better for it.</p>
