<p>DENVER  &mdash;  New research is shedding light on why young black males who have sex with males have among the highest rates of HIV infection in the United States, even though their reported use of condoms is similar to males of other racial and ethnic backgrounds</p>
<p>A key factor may be black men&rsquo;s cultural beliefs about masculinity, which may influence how they choose their sex partners, make judgments about HIV risk and make decisions about condom use, according to a study to be presented Monday, May 2, at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) annual meeting in Denver.</p>
<p>Young black males who have sex with males have twice the number of new HIV infections as young Hispanic and white men who have male partners, according to Errol L. Fields, MD, PhD, MPH, lead author of the study and a pediatric resident at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston and Boston Medical Center. They also are five times more likely to be HIV-infected than white males of similar ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;We interviewed young black men to hear the stories behind these statistics,&#8221; Dr. Fields said.</p>
<p>Thirty-five black males ages 18-24 years in New York City, upstate New York and Atlanta took part in semi- structured interviews that explored cultural and psychosocial factors that may influence how they choose sexual partners, assess HIV risk and decide whether to use condoms.</p>
<p>Most of those interviewed said they preferred to partner with men whom they perceived as masculine. Some of the young men said they allowed partners who were more masculine to control what sexual activity they engaged in and whether they used condoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that their beliefs about masculinity may affect their ability to protect themselves against HIV,&#8221; Dr. Fields said. &#8220;For example, many believed that men who acted more feminine were at greater risk for HIV than men who acted more masculine. These beliefs may have led to greater risk behavior with men who were perceived to be masculine because they believed these men were less likely to have HIV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study findings suggest that cultural beliefs about masculinity may affect HIV risk in black adolescents and young adult males who have male sexual partners and should be considered in prevention strategies directed toward this population, Dr. Fields concluded.</p>

		<p>How do they know that Eurasian Homos dont view masculinity the same way as the Black Homos? Did I miss something? Considering Blacks &amp;  Homos&rsquo; general penchant for lying casually, I&rsquo;d say these Black Homos are 2X the liars of their Eurasian Homo counterparts, ie: they&rsquo;re getting barebacked &amp; are lying about it.</p>

		<p>All this study says is that the bit about &#8220;reported condom use&#8221; being &#8220;similar&#8221; was all bunk because it was based on self-reporting on a survey about what could be construed as very personal and embarrassing questions.  </p>
<p>35 people are not enough to constitute a medically credible survey, even if they were telling the truth.  And why is a &#8220;pediatrics&#8221; researcher in a &#8220;children&rsquo;s&#8221; hospital doing research on 18- to 24-year old men?  Except if the new ObamaCare definition of &#8220;child&#8221; versus &#8220;adult&#8221; have already taken hold.</p>
<p>BTW, I fail to see how the perceived, stereotypical &#8220;masculinity&#8221; or &#8220;femininity&#8221; in a relationship between homosexual men makes one of the types more vulnerable to contract HIV/AIDS than the other.  The sex does happen, and no matter how it happens, and no matter which party is the &#8220;pitcher&#8221; or the &#8220;catcher,&#8221; if one partner has HIV, the other will get it, protection notwithstanding.</p>

		<p>A high percentage of young black males pass through the prison and jail system, maybe 25-30% of them by some estimates. This possibly accounts for a lot of their down-low behavior and rates of HIV. That&rsquo;s probably the greatest &#8220;cultural and psychosocial&#8221; factor of all yet they don&rsquo;t seem to have thought of that one.   </p>

		<p>OH, I get it. Having sex with the right masculine &#8220;partner&#8221; makes it  &#8220;better&#8221; and you are less susceptible to AIDS. Well, sure, of course. What sort of mentality thinks that way? It is beyond me. This is what they call in the &#8220;hood&#8221; low-down or down-low or something like that. Bad all the way around.</p>
<p>Maybe someone should just say they are getting AIDS because they are doing something they should not be doing?</p>

<p>Why is a pediatrics organization concentrating on black males age 18-24?  Are 18 yr olds children?  Are all pediatrics issues now so under control that this organization must concentrate on adults?<br>

		<p>Interestingly, these doctors are neglecting a small fact, a difference in genes.  People of European ancestry carry a genetic mutation, CCR5.  The theory as to why, whites have this mutation points to either the Plague or smallpox infections. The CCR5 mutation protects Europeans from HIV/AIDS, whereas blacks do not have this particular mutation making them even more susceptible to the virus. But I guess pointing out genetic differences isn&rsquo;t P.C.</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s insane.  Just when I think black irrationality can&rsquo;t surprise me anymore, I read this.  I&rsquo;ll bet the &#8220;masculine&#8221; black gays are actually more likely to have HIV since they may have learned to act tough in prison (not rare with the enormous black imprisonment rate).  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, it&rsquo;s not just black gay males - a recent article on Amren reported that black females in Tennessee are 15 times as likely to have HIV as white females.  </p>

		<p>Boy, this is really a tough one! For some reason they also father huge numbers of out-of-wedlock kids, are the most prolific rapists in the world, have violent crime rates many times those of all other races, have the highest rates of unemployment in the country, read at levels far below that of the population at large, are the most prolific illegal drug users, and practically all, when they can be pried away from their wine bottles, vote Democratic.</p>
<p>And now we find out that they have high rates of VD!  Go figure.</p>

		<p>I think young black gay males get HIV-infected more than other racial groups for the same reason that AIDS has infected a higher number of the overall population in African countries:  they don&rsquo;t use condoms out of sheer ignorance, and they see no reason to temper their sexual activity just because a potential partner is infected.  It&rsquo;s called &#8220;stupidity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>President Zuma of South Africa has many wives and concubines as this is a Zulu cultural quirk. Having had sex with a woman who was known to have AIDS, he stated publicly that he would be safe from infection as he showered immediately afterwards. From then on, every political cartoon in South Africa portrayed him with a shower stuck on his head. This is the mentality of a black president who wants to drive whites out of Africa. He consults regularly with Mugabe and no doubt swaps ideas on how to conduct &#8216;machete&rsquo; elections. </p>

I think the key word here is &#8220;reported.&#8221; Just because they SAY they&rsquo;re taking the same levels of precautions as other groups, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any concrete evidence that they are. </p>
<p>Heterosexual blacks have higher rates of every kind of STD than other races. There&rsquo;s little reason to think homosexual blacks would behave any differently from their hetero kinfolk. </p>

		<p>Reluctance to admit homosexuality and to seek medical treatment probably also are factors in high black HIV rates, as men who are debilitated by other STD&rsquo;s are more suseptible to HIV.  High drug use also lowers one&rsquo;s disease resistance and mental resolve to use protection.</p>

		<p>What this tells us is that black serum testosterone levels of +20% over other populations are the principle vector for spreading HIV among black gays.  It suggests also that where these hyper-masculinized factors are _even higher_, it effects the safety factor of the behavior itself.</p>
<p>If black gay subs and doms trade safety for wantoness based on perceived masculinity then, by taking those hyper-masculine gay men out of society or at least drastically remethodizing their sexual behaviors to a clean/isolated group; one could theoretically have a very powerful quarantine effect on the spread of HIV -outside of- black populations.</p>
<p>Into white ones.</p>
<p>My own Question Mark ponderance is:  &#8220;Does 6% of the population (2.3% if you include 18-44) making up 35-40% of the U.S. prison population hurt or help here?&#8221;  High testosterone and criminality have a high correlative R-factor too.</p>
<p>Prison gives you your isolate.  But given that most inmates will be released back to the general population, are you creating a petri dish environment or sheltering a generation of non-HIV gays to have a decent life without criminal HIV carriers in their midst acting as Typhoid Mary&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>That said, a 35 subject case study and &#8216;structured&rsquo; interviews is immediately suspect for it&rsquo;s statistical validity and bias.<br>
Without knowing some key further answers on criminality and bisexuality as well as prevailing attitudes towards down-low behavior (which I believe varies, regionally) this is an incomplete analysis.</p>
<p>If I am right, it suggests that a break down in national order which resulted in the loss of containment on our prison systems could have a massive epidemiological as well as criminal effect on our total population in a sustained crisis.</p>
<p>All the more reason to _separate and secede_.</p>

		<p>RACE, EVOLUTION, AND BEHAVIOR, by Professor J. Philippe Rushton<br>
University of Western Ontario<br>
 <br>
On average, Orientals are slower to mature, less fertile, and less sexually active, have larger brains and higher IQ scores. Blacks are at the opposite end in each of these areas. Whites fall in the middle, often close to Orientals&hellip;<br>
 <br>
There are high levels of AIDS in Africa, Black America, and the Caribbean and low levels in China and Japan. European countries again fall in between&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Blacks are sexually active at an earlier age than Whites. Whites, in turn, are sexually active earlier than Orientals. Surveys from the World Health Organization show this three-way racial pattern to be true around the world. National surveys from Britain and the United States produce the same findings&hellip;<br>
 <br>
The 1997 syphilis rate among Blacks was 24 times the White rate. The nationwide syphilis rate for Blacks was 22 cases per 100,000 people. It was 0.5 cases per 100,000 for Whites, and even lower for Orientals &hellip;<br>
 <br>
Racial differences also show in the current AIDS crisis. Over 30 million people around the world are living with HIV or AIDS. Many Blacks in the U.S. do get AIDS through drug use, but more get it through sex&hellip;<br>
 <br>
The epidemic started in Black Africa in the late 1970s. Today 23 million adults there are living with HIV/AIDS. Over fifty percent of these are female. This shows that transmission is mainly heterosexual. Currently, 8 out of every 100 Africans are infected with the AIDS virus and the epidemic is considered out of control. In some areas the AIDS rate reaches 70%. In South Africa one in 10 adults is living with HIV&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Three percent of Black men and 1% of Black women in the U.S. are living with HIV (Chart 5). The rate for White Americans is less than 0.1%, while the rate for Asian Americans is less than 0.05%<br>

<p>ONLY a very small percentage of whitey have this mutation. ONLY about 2 % or 5 % of whitey have the mutation and are not susceptible to AIDS. Orientals and Bantu both do not have the mutation. ONLY whitey.</p>

I enjoy visiting the AmRen site regularly, but it&rsquo;s disappointing to see so many comments from &#8220;cranks&#8221; who are basically anti-everybody.  Just keep in mind that many homosexuals agree with the mission of AmRen, and we do read your comments.  Race and sexual orientation are mutually exclusive.  Don&rsquo;t conflate the two.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As an upscale profesional, gay Black man who has posted on this website in the past, I question the validity of this study. I have been sexually involved with men of all races (although I have only has sex with only one Asian man)I can tell you firsthand that you will find men of all races who insist on using condoms (I am one of them) and those who refuse to use them. In return, I refuse to engage in sexual intercourse with them.</p>
<p>Responsible and irreponsible gay men transcend racial and economic lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks for taking your time to write.</p>
<p>You question the validity of the study simply because of your own individual experience?</p>
<p>The study doesn&rsquo;t argue every African American gay male gets HIV or AIDS or there aren&rsquo;t those with exception. It argues why &#8220;young black males who have sex with males have among the highest rates of HIV infection in the United States, even though their reported use of condoms is similar to males of other racial and ethnic backgrounds.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>beliefs about masculinity may affect their ability to protect themselves against HIV</i></p>
<p>Beliefs about masculinity as the reason blacks won&rsquo;t protect themselves from HIV infection?!? Zillions of dollars spent on bogus studies by &#8220;academics&#8221; with  &#8220;MD&#8221;, &#8220;PhD&#8221; and &#8220;MPH&#8221; behind their names and the best they can come up with is black &#8220;beliefs about masculinity?&#8221; For God&rsquo;s Sake, gimme a break!!</p>
<p>All they have to do is read &#8220;Up to My Neck&rsquo;s&#8221; succinct, clearly written post to find the answers they&rsquo;re seeking:</p>
<p><i>With high levels of testosterone and poor impulse control what would you think would happen? It&rsquo;s the &#8216;live for today&rsquo; attitude, because tomorrow is still tomorrow and that &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; might be gone.</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your answer Pediatric Academic Society!  I&rsquo;m sure &#8220;Up to My Neck&#8221; would be thrilled to fly in and address your next conference with the REAL answer as to why blacks have higher HIV rates than Whites.</p>
<p>And all it took was common sense, so much lacking in academia these days.</p>
<p>To wit:  </p>
<p>The schools have been flooded with massive amounts of HIV/AIDS prevention information, &#8220;awareness&#8221; and &#8220;education&#8221; going on 20 years now  &mdash;  as per the demands and political pressure by gay activists, mostly out of the Castro District of SF, who insisted (wrongly) that EVERYONE is at the same exact risk of catching HIV, straight and gay, male and female, child and adult   &mdash;   ALL at the same risk!</p>
<p>The entire high school health curricula was re-centered around AIDS awareness for years   &mdash;   entire textbooks devoted exclusively to AIDS, visits from noble AIDS victims, AIDS poetry, AIDS assemblies and rallies, marches and 5K races to raise &#8220;awareness&#8221; of AIDS, AIDS documentaries featuring a teary-eyed Magic Johnson (who claimed for a while that he had &#8220;beaten AIDS&#8221;).  For years it was AIDS AIDS AIDS.</p>
<p>AIDS awareness permeated the high school curriculum, to the detriment of other, more common STIs such as HPV, the #1 STI at the moment, highly contagious, rampant in the general population and responsible for increasing cervical cancers rates in young females and throat, mouth, head and jaw cancers in males (you can connect the dots yourself). </p>
<p><i>In the United States, an estimated 75% to 80% of males and females will be infected with HPV in their lifetime.</i> </p>
<p>And, the &#8220;receiver&#8221; in a gay relationship is more vulnerable to HIV infection because the tissue near the anus is very thin and fragile leading to tearing and bleeding during&hellip;..creating a direct opening for the HIV virus to enter the body&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why is a pediatrics organization concentrating on black males aged 18-24?  Are 18 year-olds children?&#8221;</p>
<p>They are whenever some dishonest &#8220;researcher&#8221; needs to skew statistics for political purposes.  I remember a study on firearms deaths from about 15 years ago that considered 18-25 year olds to be &#8220;children&#8221; (the same study also lumped gunshot suicides in with murders in order to inflate that statistic.)</p>

<p>Blacks- gay and straight, male and female- are less likely to use protection and as a result have the highest rates of AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes, HPV, etc.</p>

<p>As for &#8220;millions&#8221; of gay men practicing &#8220;safe&#8221; sex, where is YOUR proof? Do you know millions personally? As for &#8220;understanding&#8221; gay people, I could care less about &#8220;understanding&#8221; why they do what they do. That is your job.</p>

<p><i>&hellip;it is probably safe to say that straight people are likely to be just as sexually adventurous as gay people and that you should not assume that gays are wildly promiscuous and non-gays are not. That is indeed narrow minded thinking.</i><br>

<p>Wrong.  The gay males (on average), have significantly more lifetime sexual partners (promiscuity) than heterosexuals (on average).  The &#8220;on average&#8221; addendum I&rsquo;ve added is to point out that statistics describe groups, not individuals - anecdotes about &#8220;this guy I know&#8221; are not relevant to group statistics.  </p>
<p>An estimated 21.6% of gay males have had 101 to 500 sex partners (1), while 28% have more than 500 (2).  Let&rsquo;s look at the facts and not be &#8220;narrow minded&#8221;, as you&rsquo;ve said! </p>

<p>Yes. I am openly gay. I am a former campaign lobbyist. I am now a business consultant and public speaker. I live in the northeast.</p>

Trent:</p>
<p>My parents and siblings and other relatives have been very supportive of me. Like many opnely gay peole, I have faced some degree of hostility from certain blacks (and Whites for that matter). In the late 1990s, when I was in my early 20s, I was attacked by a group of 5 guys Black and White. I was punched in the face, knocked to the ground, kicked in the head called &#8220;Black faggot&#8221; &#8220;punk bitch&#8221; &#8220;sick ass queer&#8221; and other degrading terms. I begged them to stop. I was afraid that they were going to kill me. Fortunately, several other bystanders came running to my defense and my attackers took off in different directions. </p>
<p>While there are many Black people who do not approve of my lifestyle (largley for religious reasons), I would argue that many of have pretty much have a &#8220;love the sinner, hate the sin&#8221; attitude toward me. The majortiy of Blacks (and non-Blacks ) are respectful toward me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>P.S. Patrick: Thank you for saying what I have been trying to tell &#8220;anonymous&#8221; for the past few days. His homophobia is very alarming. Maybe he will actually listen to a heterosexual person.</p>

<p>Sorry, but NO, I could care less about what Patrick or Trent says or for that matter what you say. Most of us have heard it all before and after awhile it becomes irrevalent and childish. Quit trying to push your lifestyle as being &#8220;normal&#8221; and we all have to accept it, including the gay agenda of indoctrinating our children in the schools, which is unforgivable and unacceptable to most decent, moral people. Do you and your liberal, accepting family members approve of that?</p>
<p>As for being a &#8220;homophobic&#8221; like I said before, your name calling games do not intimidate me, just as the &#8220;R&#8221; word is used to try to shut down any truths or opinions, so maybe you need to read what poster,37 posted. We aren&rsquo;t all as stupid or uninformed, as you seem to think.<br>

		<p>Maybe you can go back and start to read what Black Gay Man has said from the beginning?</p>
<p>He was the one who called people who disagree with him names. He is the one that brought up himself &#8220;having sex with different men and races&#8221;. He is the one that did not appreciate any truths being brought up about black gays or gays period. I believe the poster you are admonishing in your reply, you have misunderstood. They were talking about heterosexuals that they have known over their lifetime who never had aids. Never said that NO heterosexual has ever gotten aids!  Mr. Black Gay is the one who wanted us to believe that straights get aids as much as homosexuals do, which is totally false, and there is much data available to prove him wrong. </p>
<p>Of course some straights get aids but it is mostly from infected needles (drug use) or having sex with a &#8220;bi-sexual&#8221; partner that they had no clue has had sex with a gay man before. </p>
<p>As for &#8220;personal obsessions and prejudices&#8221; as you claim it is, it seems you are on board with condemning those who call gays on their game and pretend as he does, that we are all a bunch of(&hellip;..)fill in the blank. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t caught on to the PC that our society has become inundated with.</p>

<p>I am not the one who trying to &#8220;push&#8221; (to use your term) my lifestyle on anyone. It is you who are making these outlandish and yes bigoted (that&rsquo;s what your rhetoric is)paranoid claims.</p>
<p>The fact is that I respect the right of everyone to choose their sexual orientation. You should learn to do the same.  </p>
