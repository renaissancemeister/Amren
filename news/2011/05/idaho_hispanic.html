<h1><a href="https://www.boiseweekly.com/CityDesk/archives/2011/05/26/idaho-hispanic-population-grows-by-73-percent">Idaho Hispanic Population Grows by 73 Percent</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Prentice, Boise Weekly, May 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Idaho continues to reflect the nation&rsquo;s rapidly changing ethnic diversity. New figures released today by the U.S. Census Bureau show the nation&rsquo;s Hispanic population grew by more than 15 million between 2000 and 2010, and accounted for more than half of the total U.S. population increase of 27.3 million.</p>
<p>Idaho&rsquo;s Hispanic population reportedly jumped from 101,690 in 2000 to 175,901 in 2010, a full 73 percent increase. Idaho&rsquo;s overall population increased by 21.1 percent. The Magic Valley experienced the greatest Hispanic influx, while Clark, Owyhee and Power counties also saw increases.</p>

<p>So sorry for the loss of your husband at the hands of some darn illegal!  If it weren&rsquo;t for our corrupt government that illegal would never have been here in the first place to kill anyone. How many lives would have been saved if not for this traitorous government? </p>
<p>Even if not an illegal we have far too many &#8220;hispanics&#8221; that are legal who always drive drunk and cause many &#8220;accidents&#8221; here where I live  in California. Every week there is another accident involving these people who kill and maim Americans.</p>
<p>From what I have read the majority of the White people of Idaho don&rsquo;t seem to mind when blacks and hispanics move in as they are all for &#8220;diversity&#8221;. They don&rsquo;t want to be called &#8220;racists&#8221; or &#8220;White Supremacist&#8221;.  I hope this is not true because they will end up just like California in about 10 years. I have a young adult grandson who lives in Northern Idaho and he sure doesn&rsquo;t like what he is seeing with the influx of these mexicans. He knows what it is like here in California. </p>
<p>I also remember reading a few years back how there was an all out assault (by the SPLC/ACLU) against any Aryan group in CDA and how they were demonized and ostracized by these usual suspects. I thought to myself this is the same tactic they used all over the USA to flood our communities with nonwhites. FOR A REASON.</p>

		<p>Won&rsquo;t take too long for Hispanics in Idaho to be a force of political muscle for the democratic party. It will take some time but don&rsquo;t worry, more will be moving up there - as long as there is work in construction and agriculture.  </p>

		<p>They get around everywhere ONLY because white people give them jobs.  Employers don&rsquo;t want to pay a living wage to citizens.  Farmers, factory owners and on and on want to squeeze every dime of profit.  They use the excuse that they have jobs americans &#8216;won&rsquo;t do.  That is all a crock.  Pay me $10 an hour and I&rsquo;ll pick your tomatoes!  In today&rsquo;s jobless climate, americans would work for any decent wage doing just about any menial labor.  But latino workers can be paid under the table, and they will work for what they consider good wages, but would not support an american lifestlye.</p>
<p>Latino immigration of low-skilled, illiterate farmers and laborers to help property owners save some money.  This is the new form of slavery.  </p>

<p>This, an individual death, passes almost unnoticed as this sad tale continues to be repeated now in every state.  It wasn&rsquo;t so just a few generations years ago.  As we celebrate this Memorial Day weekend and the usual movies are shown of an America long since past, of men who bargained their health and lives away to keep us strong and prosperous, we must marvel at how seemingly easy it was to destroy America.</p>
<p>Many of us will point to the infiltration of all of societys&rsquo; underpinnings by those bent on that destruction, some will point to the subterfuge of the 1965 and 1986 Immigration Acts, others the absence of God from our civic lives beginning in 1962.  So what does it really matter?  We have given up without so much as a whimper.  There may be time to turn away from this destruction at the least moments remaining but that would require a civil war of great blood letting and this all the while our international enemies grow stronger.  The way left is to leave the country as undisturbed as possible and to use the same tactics the fifth columnists have used.  This means a protracted, smouldering political war of generations, just as it took to bring us to where we are.  The first order of business has to be an end to immigration.  The rest will follow.  Absent actual battles, this is a solution long term.  It will require many of us to change course in our private lives to turn our attention to this matter.  Real Patriots of wealth need to sacrifice and begin to use their resources in this matter.  The alternatives are neither healthy or wise. <br>

		<p>Well&hellip; the Idaho state government is in the process of selling fifty square miles, at a very favorable interest rate, to Communist China for the construction of factories.  No doubt these mexicans will be working there.</p>

From pure observation of a long-time resident,ever since &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; have become the majority population in California, their needs are essentially given priority in every area, jobs, social services, etc. No need to comment further about culture, race, etc. As I said, this is simply an objective statement of observed fact.</p>

		<p><i>True enough, but last November Idaho elected Raul Labrador to Congress. He&rsquo;s a conservative Republican and not too many to his right.</i></p>
<p>Technically, Raul Labrador is a white Puerto Rican. There was also a county commissioner of heavily-Hispanic Clark County (Idaho, not Nevada), Robert Vasquez, who sent the Mexican government a bill for the hospital care of the illegals in his county.</p>
<p>Hispanics are half-white in more ways than one. As Steve Sailer has pointed out, they tend to track the white vote, just about 20 points further to the left. Policies that win white votes, such as taking a hard-line stance on illegal immigration, ALSO win Hispanic votes! Thus, if one considers the whiter half of the Hispanic population that has an average IQ of 100, its voting pattern would be no different from the main white population.</p>
<p>In the long run, the Hispanic boom nationwide will continue tailing off, as it has since 2007, since Mexico&rsquo;s birth rate is now no higher than the USA&rsquo;s. Our economy won&rsquo;t recover for a long time&hellip; and neither will Hispanic population growth.</p>

		<p>Moving to a different state won&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>Moving to a community full of other &#8220;racist&#8221; whites dedicated to keeping the community white at all costs WILL, no matter what state you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re long past the point where money could have solved this problem.  Nothing short of banding together and threatening violence if we don&rsquo;t get our way(like EVERY OTHER GROUP) will solve this.</p>

<p>You are absolutely correct!  That is why I am beginning to believe that Whites are the dumbest people on earth when it comes to their own racial survival. They see no evil and speak no evil.  It&rsquo;s easier that way for them.</p>
<p>I blame much of their apathy and denial on the so-called Christian churches. False prophets. I must have a different Bible, because I do not believe in what they preach today.</p>
<p>Their &#8220;interpretations&#8221; are: </p>
<p>God will take care of it, they say. We are all God&rsquo;s children, they say. We will be &#8220;raptured&#8221;, they say. We are not to hate, they say. Love thy neighbor, turn the other cheek. Welcome the &#8220;stranger&#8221;, feed the world&rsquo;s poor, spread the Gospel to every third world heathen you can find, bring them into your lands, take care of them for life and bow down to them, all races are the same, interracial marriages/adoptions are good, etc. etc..</p>
<p>A true recipe for self annihilation of ones people. Just stop and think about what White Christians are being &#8220;taught&#8221; today. </p>
<p>&#8220;They know NOT what they do&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I think ir&rsquo;s about time people in the U.S. abandoned the politically correct word «hispanics», and called those brown invaders exactly for what they are: Mestizos, or people or mixed American Indian, Spanish and Black blood. Spaniards, usually, look nothing like individuals such as Edward James Olmos, for example.</p>
<p>I will write what I have already written many times on Amren: America cannot exist, without a White majority. The country which sent men on the moon, cannot keep on really existing, if it becomes an entity with a majority of Mestizos, people for most, cannot master the basics of modern education, like elementary math.</p>
<p>Something has got to happen, and things must change, not just for America, but for the future of humanity!</p>

		<p>Back in WWI the govt was worried about the German population of the US having some loyalty to the Kaiser so the govt set out to divide the white population of the US against its self.  The same was done in WWII they worried about German Americans.  This approach to the white folk has continued to the point that white women feel they have common cause with minority civil rights.  I have found that white folk are so propagandized by the govt they simply cannot face the idea that minorities can be a threat to them.  They immediately jump to the conclusion that whites are in the wrong in any situation.</p>
