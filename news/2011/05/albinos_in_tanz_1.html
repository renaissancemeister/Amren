			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, May 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of albinos are thought to have been killed for black magic purposes in Tanzania and albino girls are being raped because of a belief they offer a cure for AIDS, a Canadian rights group said on Thursday.</p>
<p>At least 63 albinos, including children, are known to have been killed, mostly in the remote northwest of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe there are hundreds and hundreds of killings in Tanzania, but only a small number are being reported to the police,&#8221; Peter Ash, founder and director of Under The Same Sun (UTSS), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is belief that if you have relations with a girl with albinism, you will cure AIDS. So there are many girls with albinism who are being raped in this country because of this belief, which is a false belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around 1.4 million Tanzanians among a population of 40.7 million have the HIV virus that leads to AIDS.</p>
<p>Albino hunters kill their victims and harvest their blood, hair, genitals and other body parts for potions that witchdoctors say bring luck in love, life and business.</p>
<p>&#8220;(It is believed) a person with albinism is a curse. They are from the devil, they are not human, they do not die, they simply disappear,&#8221; said Ash.</p>

		<p>Atlanta is full of White girls who volunteer themselves for the mulatto making fashion.  We see several mixed race couples every day, and if the White girls isn&rsquo;t pregnant with the huge buck&rsquo;s mulatto baby, then they have on in two already, and its head is always full of that kinky wool afro that is so truly disgusting, but authentically threatening.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Arab and Asian girls aren&rsquo;t embracing the diversity enough yet.  We ONLY  see them with their own kind, which makes us suspicious that they may be practicing &#8220;subtle and persistent forms of racism that can only be fought with more diversity and more interracial dating&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This is a primitive, ignorant, and superstitious culture.  It&rsquo;s the same mentality we have to deal with day in and day out here in the U.S.  You can&rsquo;t stop it; they don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with their actions and you can&rsquo;t tell them otherwise.  This applies to the primitive, ignorant, and superstitious black cultures everywhere.</p>

<p><i>Albinos &ldquo;are not human, they do not die, they simply disappear.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><br>
I imagine the several thousand Bantu who have slaughtered several thousand Boer in ZA&rsquo;s post-apartheid &#8220;farm invasions&#8221; (&gt;3700 and counting), similarly attempt to exculpate themselves with the rationalization that their white Afrikaans victims &ldquo;are not human, they do not die, they simply disappear.&rdquo; After all, like the albinos of their own tribe, the Boer are only &#8220;ghost people&#8221; anyhow, right? </p>
<p>This (moronic and amoral not to mention RACIST) &#8220;rationalization&#8221; must make the killing of innocent people   &mdash;   whether caucasian or African albinos   &mdash;   so much easier for the Bantu murderers to live with. I&rsquo;m sure this dehumanization eases the killers&rsquo; consciences&hellip; or whatever passes for a &#8220;conscience&#8221; in an individual with a 4th Grade education and an IQ of around 70. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the occurence frequency for this rare genetic variant?</p>
<p>Sooner or later, they will either run out of victims or the girls (who live) will begin to pass on the virus and make the point that there is no cure for the disease in question but monogamy and protection.</p>
<p>I am saddened when anyone is picked on solely for the supposed qualities they have (I think this is a large reason why whites are being persecuted, we make other ethnies &#8216;feel bad&rsquo;) but at the same time, with so many issues in play, I am forced to suggest that this is one of those matters firmly in the:</p>
<p>Not.  Our.  Problem.</p>
<p>Category.</p>
<p>Let me say one other thing here:  Africa has around a billion people today.  By 2060 it will be 2.5 billion.  Neither Ebola, AIDS, Dengue or the Mosquito will stop this Malthusian progression as indeed, the last census report I read stated that black population progression _will not_ &#8216;level off&rsquo; (as the ROW is supposed to), even by 2100.</p>
<p>Their profligate nature is itself a true menace.</p>

		<p>In Tanzania, the killing of albinos whose body parts are reportedly used to make charms has caused global consternation.   But even when witchcraft is not making the headlines, it is still a daily issue in Africa. The practitioners and their victims believe in powers that simply do not exist. Sometimes belief in the dark arts is attributed to mass poverty and state failure to &#8216;modernize&rsquo; the outlook especially of people living in the rural areas. It is argued that if people were better educated and had access to adequate health care they would understand that illness is caused by germs and not witchcraft.  But these explanations miss the biggest point. They fail to place witchcraft within the persistent African worldview. Belief in witchcraft is part and parcel of the moral universe as understood in African Traditional Religion. Contrary to popular belief, African Religion is still alive and well.  In African religious thought, the universe created by God ought to be harmonious, balanced and good. But mysterious evil powers exist that disrupt this order. Evil originates not merely from the breaking of taboos and other laws, but from spiritual, mystical powers at work in the universe.  The eminent Tanzanian theologian Fr. Laurent Magesa explains that witchcraft is supernatural. The witch is a person possessing or possessed of, or by, supernatural forces which he or she uses knowingly or unknowingly, selectively or indiscriminately, to harm others often for no apparent reason. Magesa writes that &#8220;evil, in the African perception, is always incarnated; it does not exist except as it exists in the evil person, that is, in the witch.&#8221;  So, how can belief in witchcraft be eradicated? This is hardly possible. According to Fr. Magesa, &#8220;in African Religion, witchcraft must be understood as part of the mystery of the human person&#8221;. Witchcraft is therefore central to the understanding of morality and ethics among Africans. &#8220;In the African mentality, everything wrong or bad in society and in the world, and most particularly various afflictions, originates in witchcraft. There is no kind of illness or hardship at all that may not ultimately be attributed to witchcraft&#8221;.  Belief in witchcraft shall therefore persist as long as African Traditional Religion exerts influence on Africans, no matter which country they reside, what language they speak and how educated they are. </p>

		<p>This is interesting since Tanzania was considered to be one of the African states better prepared for post-colonial independence. Yet here we are but a few decades later and they appear to be regressing. One wonders what Julius Nyere would have had to say about this state of affairs? </p>

<p>Oh, is this the same &#8220;rights groups&#8221; that defended White South African Brandon Huntley when Canada ordered him repatriated back to White genocide in black-run SA?<br>
 <br>
<i>Brandon Huntley, 32, caused a stir in Canada and South Africa in 2009 when he claimed his fear of crime against whites made him a candidate for asylum, <br>
Huntley, who grew up in Cape Town, claimed he had been attacked seven times by black robbers and called a &ldquo;white dog&rdquo; and a &ldquo;settler&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p><i>On November 24 2010, Judge James Russell ruled in the federal court that granting Huntley refugee status had been a mistake, adding it was clear Huntley came to Canada to look for work, not because he was fleeing persecution.</i></p>
<p>They did come to Brian&rsquo;s aid didn&rsquo;t they? didn&rsquo;t they?  <i>didn&rsquo;t they?</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right!  They don&rsquo;t defend Whites!  </p>
<p>They are pro-White genocide.</p>

<p>I hate to break it to you but I see far more white girls with black boys in Jacksonville, FL, and its surrounding areas, than I ever saw in my 35+ years in NYC (even when I visit there today it is RARE)!  It appears to me that southern white parents (especially the lower income variety) do a very poor parenting job these days!  And these aren&rsquo;t yankee transplants!<br>

<p>All religions, including Christianity have supernatural claims.  Any divine sort of intervention requires supernatural &#8220;magic.&#8221;  Many fundamentalist Christians today in more remote places, inside the U.S. and others, still believe in a very similar contest between God and &#8220;Satan.&#8221;  They engage in things like poisonous snake handling, believe in demon possession, etc., and work themselves up into religious frenzies not all that unlike a voodoo trance riot. (I think I recall a couple movies about Catholic based demon possession).  If you review some of the history of the church, you will find things such as, for example, an accusation concerning a demon that lived in the Pope&rsquo;s ring (14th century), and other such highly irrational reasoning and logic, driving church policy and interpretation.  Perhaps a viewing of the film, &#8220;The Crucible&#8221; would remind some of us of just how crazy our own culture has been.  It is only the rebirth of traditional philosophical reasoning and its universal school of ethics that brought about improvements in Europe and the West that allowed our progression into the modern world.  So semantics have much to do with Fr. Laurent Magasa&rsquo;s explanation.  He also has little skill at self-examination, because he has four of his fingers pointing right back at himself and his similarly structured cosmic model.</p>
<p>What the situation calls for is a crack down on the rape, maiming, and murdering of a person for whatever reason.  But one has to wonder how easily these people would transfer their albino fetish to blonde, extremely fair Nordics, and if none existed, pick out the lightest skin person for use.  However we discuss it, it is clear that religious ignorance is running amok in Africa.</p>

I don&rsquo;t disagree with anything you state. But the story was about Tanzania and Albinos. When Christianity was introduced into Africa, the superstitions and belief in the devil was melded very easily into the African mindset. It was simpler to do that than attempt to totally replace it. The same thing happened when the Roman Empire occupied Britain. They found it easier to go along with the locals and gradually assimilate with Christianity, especially with respect to such festivals as Easter, Christmas and harvest thanks. Of course, one could spend all day discussing the devastating effect that Christianity had in the &#8216;New World&rsquo; of South America along with the plunder of golden and silver treasures to melt down and ship off to Spain. Such is the way of religion. </p>

		<p>Poster #13- you make some excellent points. But I would go even one step further. Show these primitive communities in Africa, Haiti, Caribbean, Sub-Asia, and other parts of the third world, that there will be dire consequences for rape &urder.; Eye for an eye is what this world needs to get back to. At least in China &amp; parts of the Middle East will have severe punishment for street criminals. Even corporate criminals are executed over there. I think there is some effectiveness to this &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; position taken. Here in the West, we have been beaten into &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; for racism. We need to be vigilant, and get back to zero tolerance for violent felons, no matter the color.</p>
