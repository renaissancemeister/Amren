<h1>48 Women Raped Every Hour in Congo, Study Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Public Radio, May 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The African nation of Congo has been called the worst place on earth to be a woman. A new study released Wednesday shows that it&rsquo;s even worse than previously thought: 1,152 women are raped every day, a rate equal to 48 per hour.</p>
<p>That rate is 26 times more than the previous estimate of 16,000 rapes reported in one year by the United Nations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congo, a nation of 70 million people that is equal in size to Western Europe, has been plagued by decades of war. Its vast forests are rife with militias that have systematically used rape to destroy communities.</p>
<p>The analysis, which will be published in the American Journal of Public Health in June, shows that more than 400,000 women had been raped in Congo during a 12-month period between 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>On average 29 Congolese women out of every 1,000 had been raped nationwide. That means that even in the parts of Congo that are not affected by the war, a woman is 58 times more likely to be raped than a woman in the United States, where the annual rate is 0.5 per 1,000 women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The message is important and clear: Rape in (Congo) has metastasized amid a climate of impunity, and has emerged as one of the great human crises of our time,&#8221; said Michael VanRooyen, the director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.</p>
<p>Margot Wallstrom, the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict, {snip} said the figures in the study are higher than the U.N.&rsquo;s because it covers all sexual violence  &mdash;  including domestic and intimate partner violence  &mdash;  not just from military actors.</p>

		<p>I listen to National Public Radio every day for classical music and news. <br>
 <br>
I am glad this information came from that source. It makes it difficult for liberals to dismiss it. It also shows conservatives that NPR presents information that is troubling to the liberal view of the world. </p>

		<p>Looks like this woman is going to adopt a baby from the Congo and bring him here of course.  Another future rapist, maybe. I watched that Biggest Loser show a couple of times and I always had the feeling she was a phoney and quite an odd looking woman. But then of course, most people we see on TV are as liberal as the Democratic Party.</p>

		<p>Any guess as to the reasons why rape in Congo Republic is so common?  Hint:  It might have something to do with the race of the rapists.  </p>
<p>MSM and various NGOs, true to form, are spinning this outrage as a sexual awareness issue.  We need more education and outreach on domestic violence, they say.  That&rsquo;s the ticket for progress. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it this way:  If being black has nothing to do with being violent, then why do we not see rape on this gargantuan scale in mainly white nations?  Surely, our men are just as &#8220;sexist.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>Just who keeps score on that in the Congo? That seems more like the stats (reported) in Detroit. Over 38,000 (reported) black on Whites every year for the past 5 years.</p>

		<p>Oh NO!  This can&rsquo;t be right!  Rapes in the Congo?  Never! You see, the Father of Prince Shembo, the great Football Standout at Notre Dame, is from the Congo.  And Prince Shembo is a perfect gentleman.  Lizzie Seeberg&rsquo;s suicide had nothing to do with his behavior.  Just ask the University. </p>

<p>Glad that you, too, have noticed the convergance of stats between Detroit and Congo. Stats for murder, rape, illiteracy.</p>
<p>Is is not fascinating that two populations who share nothing but their genetic makeup slowly but surely begin to exhibit identical bahaviour as well as creating identical environments for themselves?</p>
<p>This seems like the ultimate twin study gone global.</p>
<p>The nature versus nurture debate is thus conclusively ended.</p>
<p>Nature wins.</p>

		<p>Speaking of the Congo rape stats, here is something of interest for Amreners. &#8220;The Color Of Crime In Alabama&#8221;. The site has Amren on it&rsquo;s blogroll of sites to visit. We need to visit all the sites listed as well.</p>

<p>Notice the stat that says &#8220;White on black rapes&#8221;&hellip;now I have to really wonder who those &#8220;Whites&#8221; are? Do you think hispanics, etc were listed as &#8220;Whites&#8221; when they are the perps, just as the DOJ does? </p>

		<p>Where do the militias get their money, weapons and other supplies in order to do this?  Who do they work for?</p>
<p>Short answer&hellip;..France.</p>
<p>Much of what goes on in Africa is specifically enabled by various European nations.  The same people who insist we are all alike and race is just a construct, turn right around, and knowing in great detail and specificity how the races are different, use that knowledge to foment chaos, war, and rape as a tool of terror, to break up any hint of unified behavior, so they can waltz in and rape the continent of its mineral wealth.</p>
<p>In the old days, &#8220;colonization&#8221; meant whites creating and controlling states in order to gain access to the wealth of Africa&hellip;..and giving the Africans both a place, and a share of that wealth.</p>
<p>Today, it means underwriting various strongmen who understand that the limit of their ambitions is to enjoy a lavish lifestyle and enslave their people as proxy to foreigners who want neither to get their hands dirty or be identified with the situation.</p>
<p>Want to know what happens to african leaders who don&rsquo;t cooperate?  Watch what they do to Khadaffi.</p>
<p>Want to really understand the depths of their evil?  Look what they did and are doing in South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>How did Africans come to control those countries after whites had such iron clad control there, peace and prosperity?  In true Maoist fashion, a hostile foreign government weakened and helped destroy those white governments.  White people in Africa are a true threat to the chaos they use to prevent resistance to their goals&hellip;&hellip;so they decided genocide was the answer.</p>

		<p>I smell grant hustlers and non profit pimps lurking about.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth of the statistics, the feminazis are looking to get a grant to go live in Congo and raise awareness or some such nonsense.</p>
<p>They will of course discover that the root causes are lingering effects of European colonialism and Whtie racism, just as the liberals claimed that the Rwanda massacres of 900,000 people were caused by the lingering effects of European colonialism.</p>

<p>Nice try at flogging an old, tired out, conspiracy theory.  It isn&rsquo;t even a little up to date, because it is actually China that is making inroads in Africa, not France or Europe.  As for <br>
Khadaffi, cry me a river!  Who in their right mind wants this guy to remain in power?  Who ever supported him besides Nazis because like Saddam Hussein, he was trained by them?  Read up on the history of the Nazis in Arabic/Muslim countries 1930-48.</p>

		<p>I actually heard this reported on the BBC world news last week. I wasn&rsquo;t too suprised, but I honestly didn&rsquo;t think the numbers would be so high; they may well be higher! It&rsquo;s nearly one rape a minute!<br>
Now, between what happens/happened in Congo, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and South Africa (just to name a few), how can anyone but a complete liar of imbecile believe that Africans are fit to live in civilised societies such as ours?<br>
A while ago I heard on of those &#8216;flashback&rsquo; segments on the BBC world news. It was about when apartheid was introduced in SA.<br>
The reported asked the rep from the SA authorities why he felt such a policy had to be introduced; he replied, &#8216;if the White minority doesn&rsquo;t maintain control here in SA, it will slide into barbarism.&rsquo;<br>
The host of the show played a segment from some SA citizens who expressed the same sentiments, and said host expressed his distaste for such &#8216;racist&rsquo; attitudes.<br>
History has certainly proved the above people to be correct in their assumptions of what would happen to SA if blacks gained control. As soon as Bono and the rest left the party to go home, South African blacks were free to rape and kill each other with impunity; as predicted.<br>
