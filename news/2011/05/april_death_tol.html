<h1><a href="https://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7551088.html">April Death Toll Highlights Trauma of Mexican Bloodbath</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dudley Althaus, Houston Chronicle, May 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For anyone dreaming of an imminent end to the criminal bloodbath tormenting Mexico, April was perhaps the cruelest month.</p>
<p>More than 1,400 gangland killings were clocked, by one newspaper&rsquo;s count, giving April the highest death toll of the 53 months since President Felipe Calderon unleashed the military and federal police against the country&rsquo;s crime syndicates. The toll includes more than 300 bodies pulled from mass graves near the South Texas border and in other northern Mexican states.</p>
<p>Many of the graves&rsquo; victims were killed weeks, even months earlier. Still, nearly 40 people a day were slain last month, according to Milenio, the newspaper that tallied the 1,402 deaths. In April&rsquo;s last week alone, gunmen abducted 11 city police officers, including the force&rsquo;s chief, in a Monterrey suburb.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>As the crackdown slogs into a fifth year and the body count ticks toward 40,000, opinion polls suggest a growing legion of Mexicans share Fox&rsquo;s frustration. Thousands of Mexicans are expected to march Sunday in Mexico City and elsewhere to demand an end to the violence.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p><br>
&#8216;Murderous competition&rsquo;</p>
<p>Determining which killings are linked to organized crime is often more an art than a science. Milenio&rsquo;s tally has not been confirmed by the Mexican government. But such media counts in recent years have proved to be low when the government later released its own figures.</p>
<p>Government officials argue the violence primarily is between gangland rivals, though civilians have increasingly fallen victim to both criminals and security forces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As they long have been, the killings tallied in April were mostly concentrated in a handful of states on the U.S. border and in the Pacific coast states of Guerrero and Sinaloa, Milenio reported.</p>

		<p>IF this death toll is true (why should any of us EVER simply take what the lamestream media tells us&hellip;think Jessica Lynch, Bin Laden, etc.), then this is much worse than the Viet Nam War.<br>
On our southern Border, there is a great war raging. And it&rsquo;s here on our streets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a stark realization, again, assuming (and that&rsquo;s a big one, considering our lousy media whores) that it&rsquo;s true.<br>
 <br>
Makes me wonder: will that war spread to the USA in full? Will the USA invade Mexico in the interest of keeping the peace? Will Mexico implode and incinerate?</p>

		<p>Another reason for our traitors to keep our borders wide open, right? We already have tens of thousands of their murderous mexican gangs here! Yet, even they won&rsquo;t be deported! They will legalize them all and bring in their &#8220;family&#8221; gangbangers to boot.</p>

<p>Poster, I hope not!  They will make Mexico another State and we will have the &#8220;privilege of supporting them all, not to mention putting up with their gang banging/murderous ways and never fear, the drug cartels will still be there. </p>
