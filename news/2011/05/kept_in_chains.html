<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that one in three Somalis have suffered from some kind of mental illness, a rate that is among the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Somalia is also among the worst places on earth to have a mental illness.</p>
<p>Resources are so limited that many are simply chained up without medication. The country has just three psychiatrists at its main mental health facilities nationwide.<br>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s true then it&rsquo;s evidence that neurological impairments are mostly environmental, plus the fact that severely traumatized soldiers with PTSD often develop phobias, mental illness &amp; autism much like children who suffer child abuse from cold unloving parents. Sadlly these Somalians dont have internet access or they&rsquo;d be trolling Wahabi websites like their Western counterparts troll WN sites.</p>

		<p>Could the crisis be linked to race, tribal backwardness and genetic inbreeding?  Heaven forbid.  Something to think about anyway, as a growing number of Midwest cities, especially Columbus and Minneapolis, are now home to fast-growing Somali populations. </p>

		<p>BUT!<br>
Before you hold this bit of evidence up to your liberal crusader friends, know this: they are already charging down the street with a reason for why Somalians are so mad&hellip;<br>
It&rsquo;s the war, you know! War made them crazy!</p>
<p>Just tell you libtard crusader friends: &#8220;But didn&rsquo;t Somalians make the war?&#8221;</p>
<p>Watch their eyes jiggle for that second as they nearly have a seizure trying to outsmart logic itself on that one.</p>
<p>Seriously, Libbos (hey, I made a new word!) will say stuff like&#8221; &#8220;If we saw so many people killed and mutilated, if thousands of kids had their arms hacked off, if rape were so rampant, we&rsquo;d be mentally ill, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you will say (and what thinking person wouldn&rsquo;t?) &#8221; Ahem, wasn&rsquo;t it SOMALIS that committed all this horror? Were they not mad by Western standards to begin with?</p>
<p>&hellip;Another flop-sweat moment for the libtards, a stutter, an &#8220;um, well,&#8221; and then the nonstop babbling machine of nonsense will kick into gear, and you&rsquo;ll get the endless prattle of rehashed excuses, and perversions of truth and sense.<br>
Moral of the story: You can shut up a liberal for about two seconds, but that&rsquo;s it. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Kept in Chains: Mental Illness Rampant in Somalia&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be better stated and just as honest to say that mental illness is rampant within the black community world wide, especially the US.</p>
<p>Is there another race of people who think aids and drugs were introduced into their neighborhoods to kill them off or that the levees in N.O. were blown up by whites to kill off blacks?  Or that whites shot the nose off the Sphinx, because it had a broad, flat one, or that blacks built the pyramids, or that they invented the helicopter, ball point pens, space ships that fly around the moon and back and on and on and on, with one mentally deranged claim after another? </p>
<p>Having low intellects afflicts blacks and keeps them from succeeding, but their mental aberrations are greater handicaps for them, especially since they have huge egos and go berserk and riot if they&rsquo;re criticized for their pathologies. </p>

		<p>Well here comes another &#8220;preferred group&#8221;.. Think our SSA/SSI offices won&rsquo;t be swamped? Where are we going to get the money to support all these people? Guess. They will just cut the elderly and disabled (mostly Whites) benefits another $200 a month or so. Who cares if they can pay their rent and buy food? They are only the White elderly that some blacks and mexicans have said to kill off anyway. </p>
<p>Plus they will make the age of retirement go up to 75 years or older before YOU can apply.</p>
<p> WHY do we just sit here and allow all these blacks, etc to come into our country by the millions? Are we really that suicidal? What is worse, marching in the streets to protest our demise or simply giving in to the REAL haters of our race? </p>

		<p>Once upon a time, in another life, I was a master&rsquo;s level therapist that worked inpatient with the severely mentally ill.</p>
<p>Although medications helped, there were two primary methods of treatment.  The first was rehab.  Many if not most, serious mental illness is actually caused by drug use.  Much more is exacerbated by it.  Getting the patient to stop taking drugs is a MAJOR breakthrough&hellip;.usually the only difference between being able to live out there in some halfway house setting and eventually their own job and place to live, and being stuck inpatient.</p>
<p>The other is daily skills living.  Which basically means, training them that they get up, same time every morning.  Shave, shower etc.  Make their bed.  Eat a nutritious breakfast.  Adhere to a schedule.  Interact with others.</p>
<p>In other words, practicing the normal things that normal people do every day, IS, the primary treatment for serious mental illness.</p>
<p>Chaining a person to the wall?  They are only going to get worse.</p>

		<p>With so few psychological facilities and professionals, how did anyone make such a diagnosis of the rate of mental illness?  Did someone stop people on the street and ask them or go to villages and inquire of shamans?  This sounds like liberal claptrap, possibly another excuse to bring these poor third-worlders to the U.S., where they can apply for SSI and get all the help they &#8220;need&#8221;!  Since some of these immigrants turn out to be among the most uncivilized and violent we have, maybe the anti-American crowd figures they can do the most damage in bringing Western society down.  It&rsquo;s possible, though, that Somalis do seem crazy when compared to whites.  Like many blacks, they engage in magical thinking, frequent temper tandrums, and complete obliviousness of law and order.</p>

<p>You mean the insane White population of America. </p>
<p>Congress would never get away with what they have done to us if White people had some backbone and demanded America stay White (as the Founders intended) way back in the 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Thanks to the war in Europe back in the 40&rsquo;s,(intentional,of course) the opportunity was taken by the enemy within all White nations, to demonize and brainwash Whites all over the world to set the stage to flood our nations with 3rd world peoples who will obviously displace our own race from our homelands. Isn&rsquo;t that called genocide? </p>

		<p>First cousin marriage for a couple thousand years, and rampant father daughter, niece uncle, and worst of all full and half brother sister incest all produce physical, mental and intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>In all black communities, full brother sister incest is rampant.  Actually, it&rsquo;s more like rape of the sisters.  That alone would produce problems.</p>
<p>Maybe the WHO is diagnosing normal black African behavior with mental illness.  </p>
<p>Or maybe they are trolling for more funding.</p>
<p>Personally I think it is another bogus problem that can only be solved by massive amounts of aid funneled to the standard corrupt Africans and White idiot do gooders looking for a well paid NGO job.</p>

<p>A lot of this Somali &#8220;mental illness&#8221; may be merely mental inadequacy. Below a certain IQ level, &#8220;psychological problems&#8221; and plain old stupidity aren&rsquo;t always easily told apart. Both result in the individual acting in ways that aren&rsquo;t in their own best interest, or are harmful or self-injurious. </p>
<p>At or under 70 IQ, there&rsquo;s usually plenty of both craziness AND dumbness to be seen. It&rsquo;s not an either/or proposition. </p>

		<p>Personally, I think the &#8220;mental illness&#8221; is infecting Americans that continue to bring these dangerous Somali black Muslims into the U.S. in increasingly huge numbers and settle them on unsuspecting towns and cities in American rural areas. Those unsuspecting citizens are then expected to provide for those black Muslim Somalis&rsquo; every need and want, or &#8220;they be racissss&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree here, we can&rsquo;t chain these poor black, Somali Muslims up, we need to give them automobiles and driving licenses, access to weapons and ammo&hellip;that will make them all better for sure.</p>

		<p>Pooster #14- I think you are smart enough to find some middle ground here. I believe since most of these 3rd world nations do not know what human rights are. That being said they can most certainly find out from a more civilized nation that it&rsquo;s not wise to chain people up. Yes, it will make things worse, but the point is being missed. DO NOT SEND US THE LEAST DESIRABLES FROM THESE SLUMS! It&rsquo;s hard enough to find one who will study here, learn the language, work hard, have a desire	to marry an American black and pay taxes. But ones who are insane, too? You posters are right. DC is full of White insane idiots, but they are rich &amp; powerful. Most were not voted in. They were appointed in.</p>

		<p>What No autism? I thought that Autism was the &#8220;the Illness of the day.&#8221;Aberant behavior is due to the Mercury involve in innoculations in kids. Oh, the Somalis are not innoculated. Perhaps a touch of birth control should be added to any sort of Somali immoculation programs. <br>

		<p>I doubt if a Somali:</p>
<p>A.  Can find chains, manacles, a wall and something to anchor <br>
    the chains into said wall.<br>
B.  Would feed someone who did nothing for them.<br>
C.  Would fail to note the obvious, &#8216;Spartan&rsquo;, solution to the <br>
    problem and apply it, with vigor.  7.62X39 is cheap in <br>
    Africa.</p>
<p>OTOH, these people also have a daily habit with khat.  I imagine if you do that long enough, you will end up seriously mentally twisted, as with most drugs.</p>

		<p>Do you think that blacks suffer more mental illness?  Bipolar, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder?  It seems that way to me.  I think the new DSM-V of psychiatric disorders will have a category for temper tantrums.  Is this a new way for the overwhelmingly liberal psychiatric community to excuse away bad behavior and maybe secure more SSI checks for black kids?  They already get enough.  Any stats on this?  I would love to see the figures for certain cities like Camden, New Orleans, Oakland, etc.</p>
