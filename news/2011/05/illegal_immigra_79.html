<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SB-1070 is having an affect.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants are boycotting Arizona by the thousands, showing their outrage with Arizona&rsquo;s controversial new SB-1070 law by moving elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the small town of Guadalupe, AZ, south of Phoenix, Manuel Renaldo is one of those who is punishing Arizona by leaving. As he loaded his stolen car with his belongings and family of ten, Renaldo told this reporter through an interpreter &#8220;It&rsquo;s a matter of principle. I refuse to be supported by a state that treats me like a criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The effects of the exodus are being felt by Arizona retailers who are reporting dwindling sales of beer, spray paint, and ammunition. Also hit hard are the states hospitals, which have reported a dramatic decline in births and emergency room visits. Tattoo parlors are in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Renaldo told a reporter through an interpreter &#8220;He and his family are moving to California, which is a state that will support him and his family with dignity.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because you ARE a criminal, Sr. Renaldo!</p>
<p>You and the rest of los ilegales are more than welcome to boycott.  Please be sure to extend this to the other 49 states as well.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re not serious are you?  This story is for real?   I absolutely thought it was a joke.  He actually said &hellip;.&#8221;It&rsquo;s a matter of principle. I refuse to be supported by a state that treats me like a criminal.&rdquo;  Well here is a little refrain for ya there Manuel,  &#8221; Take your freeloading self and please GO to California and freeload on them.  We here in AZ don&rsquo;t want or need you and your &#8220;family&#8221; of ten sucking on the spigot.  And take a few of your &#8220;homies&#8221; with ya.  I&rsquo;m sure that the taxpayers of Arizona would be glad to see you go.! &#8220;</p>

		<p>Fine.  Let &#8216;em boycott and go back home.  I&rsquo;ll pay them.  So a few convenience stores and Western Union outlets in Arizona will see sales drop.  Meanwhile, taxpayers will never have it so good.  The streets and schools will be safer.  And fewer cars will be missing.    </p>

<p>He loaded his STOLEN car with his family of TEN?! </p>
<p>So the fact that he&rsquo;s a confirmed theif is suppose to make us fell sorry for him?</p>
<p>Arizona retailers have seen a decline in sales of beer, spray paint (no doubt for that wonderful art form known as graffiti), and ammunition (hmmm&hellip; why would all those law abiding &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; immigrants need weapons anyway?) </p>
<p>And he says he&rsquo;s moving to California because it&rsquo;s a &#8220;state that will support him&#8221; (emphasis added) and his family! There you have it in a nutshell. The ever dwindling population of tax paying Californians will be forced by their government to support him and his TEN kids. Only in America!!!</p>

		<p>So California will support Senor Reynaldo (and his wife and ten kids) with dignity&hellip; Used to be a MAN supported himself, his wife and however many kids they created with dignity by WORKING at a job. Guess Sr. Reynaldo never thought of that way of doing it  &mdash;  but then, whyever should he? He has the nice, loving, giving American taxpayers to give them all they need and most of what they want, and they can always steal anything else their little hearts desire.</p>

		<p>I see all of us here are finding it difficult to believe this story is real. But HAVE they dropped that same old tired story that they only came here to find work and a better life? They may as well. Our government does NOTHING to stop them, so come on out of the shawdows and be honest about why you&rsquo;re really here.</p>

<p>No, of course it&rsquo;s not real. It&rsquo;s a joke article. But it&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s true. We all know there are people just like this fictitious Manuel Renaldo.</p>

		<p>Of course this article sounds like a satire, and even the pix looks photoshopped!  But the &#8220;facts&#8221; of the case have the clear ring of truth.  Illegals have been avoiding or fleeing AZ, and there are brazen mestizoes in the SW who demand welfare, free schooling, and free medical services as a basic right of simply being present on American soil.  </p>

		<p>If it is true that illegals are boycotting Arizona, it must be be a hoax.  Why would anyone leave when there is so much opportunity, and support from the Federal government?  Don&rsquo;t they realize Barry, the usurper, is going to make them citizens, with no doubt some remuneration for the pain they have experienced?  How sad I am, that they are leaving!</p>

<p>No, big business depends on cheap labor to maximize its profits in America&rsquo;s race to the bottom.  Those companies are just going to have to hire Americans at decent wages to get the job done.  Oh, horror of horrors!!!!!<br>

		<p>How did whites ever get by economically without nonwhites? Certainly, whites have a rich history. The USA was over 90% white until the mid 60s. Now, we are dependent on illegals? Makes no sense. </p>
