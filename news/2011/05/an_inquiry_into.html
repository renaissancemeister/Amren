			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Agence France Presse, May 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An inquiry was begun Wednesday to confirm the allegations of a refugee from Libya who said that a number of passengers on board his boat were thrown overboard as human sacrifices in order to calm a storm. A Ghanaian, age 16, who was rescued during the night of Saturday/Sunday off the Italian island of Lampedusa, explained to the humanitarian association &#8220;Save the Children,&#8221; that a group of Ghanaians had conducted a ritual human sacrifice.</p>
<p>{Snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like a sacrificial rite,&#8221; he explained to the daily La Stampa, adding that the captain of the boat had chosen the victims and that other men had thrown them overboard.</p>
<p>The young Ghanaian, who is now in a refugee center in Italy, said that one of his brothers was among the victims. He also said that women were raped aboard the boat.</p>
<p>According to press reports, other refugees have confirmed the boy&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>Thousands of refugees fleeing the war in Libya  &mdash;  for the most part workers who had immigrated from Africa and Asia  &mdash;  have arrived in Italy over the last several weeks in mass landings on the island of Lampedusa.</p>

		<p>Why is a Ghanian claiming to be a Libyan refugee?  Why was he even Libya in the first place.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember my parents and their marxist friends totally rejoicing about Ghana.  It was the first African colony that the Europeans left.  I think that the Kennedys held a White House state dinner dance for the President and his wife who was all decked out in Dior.  There were adulatory articles and pictures in Time, Look etc.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Ghana is now a typical African country whose population wants nothing more than escape.  I also have gathered over the years that Libya is regarded as a sort of promised land, not quite as nice as Europe but better than any African country and is usually flooded with black African illegal squatters.</p>

		<p>The article describes them as &#8216;workers&rsquo;, yet the boy is only 16.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing this has absolutely nothing to do with the war in Libya and that, as we speak, Ghanains are leaving their villages by the hundreds to catch a Europe-bound boat.</p>

		<p>The continued stupidity of our self-hating, leftist white governments amazes me. If there were rapists aboard the boat why would you offer them asylum?! I fear for the Italian women living near this refugee center. And why do we continue to accept this &#8220;refugees&#8221;? This boy wasn&rsquo;t even a native born Libyan, he and everyone else on the boat likely want to get away from the hellhole that is Ghana and live comfortably on White welfare while hating the people who support them. And if they were truly fleeing the violence in Libya we care why? The conflict isn&rsquo;t our problem. Let the Muslims and Africans slaughter each other. We&rsquo;re only adding more problems to a system that&rsquo;s going to collapse anyway.</p>

		<p>Incessantly we read of the horrors of slave-ships and the Atlantic passage.<br>
 But, here in 2011 we read of black Africans volutarily putting themselves in similar conditions in the hope that White Europeans will show them some mercy.</p>

		<p>The liberal media will of course blame the sacrifices on the influence of Pentecostal churches, just as they have blamed all the African child tortures and killings that occur in Europe itself.  And they will claim that black Africans swarming north are all political refugees from Libya and Tunisia.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me almost a lifetime to realize the utter depth of liberal evil.  Cultural leftists will go out of their way to concoct intricate lies to defend their non-white, non-Christian darlings, caring not a whit for all the misery caused to their own nations and fellow citizens.  Many of them actually hate any white person who opposes their agenda, and thus they wish on us all the ill non-whites can offer.  It&rsquo;s what we deserve, they believe.  </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t they ALWAYS say that?  It is to gain sympathy from the West and make these liberals go crazy with importing even more refugees into our lands&hellip; It&rsquo;s a scam!</p>

		<p>HOW DARE YOU! Blacks do NOT rape women. This is outrageous. They are just poor people fleeing for a better life of wefare and handouts and multiple wives and 100 kids each. </p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re all missing the _tribal angle_.  Reread the original article using a translator: the victims were Ghanaian, the attackers were Nigerian.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Nigerians are assertive, colourful, flamboyant, stylish, sometimes loquacious, lavish, daring, supremely ambitious, domineering, proud, arrogant, very brilliant and intelligent, brash, intimidating, beautiful and charming, hardworking, ubiquitous, pugnacious, crooked and corrupt, impossible to ignore and so on.<br>
Everywhere we go, we stand out like the peacock. It is so easy to spot a Nigerian, even in China. The way we walk, and speak, and behave generally, like the owners of heaven and earth, makes it impossible for most people not to detest us.<br>
But it is not our fault. God must have created us to be different and to be a special people, with a proud and glorious heritage. Just mention any country as endowed as Nigeria in Africa, with our population, natural resources, fertile minds, aggressive ambition, superlative fashion sense, never–say–die attitude, spiritual fortification against natural disasters and the Midas touch. Never mind our bad luck with getting leaders who can lead us out of economic doldrums and political instability. It is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>I must also alert our nation and our government urgently about the new threat that is growing against Nigerians and Nigerian interests in Ghana. I have been a major marketer of the renewed Nigeria – Ghana economic and tourism alliance in the last 12 years, out of which I have lived there for about five years.<br>
Nigerians today are invading Ghana in droves as tourists and investors. The influx of Nigerians has made Ghana to become an expensive country to live in. Our rich students are all over the campuses in Ghana spending an average of $10,000.00 per annum, as a result of the collapse of education at home in Nigeria. Ghanaian hospitals are also enjoying the boom.<br>
Our tourists are flying in on different airlines from Nigeria and beyond and taking over major hotels in the capital city of Accra.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/oZZcn</p>
<p>The two groups despise each other on everything from soccer to politics to &#8216;tourism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is what makes violence in Europe not just inevitable but certain to be brutal.  These people are bringing, not just Africa, &#8216;but all their friends&rsquo; with them.</p>
<p>A darker world&hellip;</p>

		<p>I find this unseemly rush to judgement of these Ghanans as a thinly disguised swipe at multiculturalism and tolerance.</p>
<p>Who are we to criticize these people for their proclivities favoring rape and murder, or cannibalism for that matter?  The latter, by the way, could go a long way toward solving nutritional and overpopulation problems. </p>
