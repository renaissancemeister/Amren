<h1>Police Shut Down Wave Country Due to Unruly Crowd</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Cannon, News Channel 5 (Nashville), May 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly two dozen police officers were called out to Wave Country on Monday afternoon after large crowds of people became unruly. The disturbance forced park managers to close the facility two hours early on Memorial Day. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Metro Police were called out to Wave Country around 1 p.m. because the crowd outside the gates and inside the park was acting up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That crowd refused to follow any kind of instructions. They became disorderly,&#8221; according to Cpt. Marlene Pardue from Metro Police.</p>
<p>There were several fights inside. Police said one of the biggest problems was people jumping the fence to get into the park, creating chaos inside the park.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just kids jumping the fence, but adults, with children and strollers, putting them over the fence, then jumping the fence,&#8221; Cpt. Pardue said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Park managers said this is the first time in 30 years they have had to close Wave Country because the crowd became uncontrollable.</p>

<p>We HAD a nice ethnic festival all summer in Downtown Detroit.  Each weekend there was a different culture celebrated.  Youths forced them to move it to the burbs. </p>
<p>We have regular shootings and robberies at the local shopping mall.  I don&rsquo;t even go there anymore.   The youths ran me out&hellip;I shop WAY out in the country now. </p>

		<p>The Nashville Agrarians are still demonized because they protested against Federal interference in the South&rsquo;s private affairs, such as our God-sanctioned Segregation of the Races through justified and very necessary Jim Crow laws that kept the blacks in their place.</p>
<p>Now, let the liberals compare the Agrarians to these &#8220;youths&#8221; and tell us which will more likely cause the total collapse of <br>
American Civilization: the racist Agrarians or the uncontrollable Diversity?</p>
<p>Black just can&rsquo;t seem to stop themselves from constantly acquitting every segregation-loving racist that ever yelled &#8220;Whites Only!&#8221;  The evidence is in, and now we know, that you can Civilization or Diversity, but you cannot and will not have both.  </p>
<p>We are redeemed upon the evening newscast of more black violence.  Segregation wasn&rsquo;t a sin- it was ordained self defense.  Bring it back, and hurry!  Civil Rights is a scam, and everybody knows it, but we are the only ones who will say it.  Not for long.  Soon, even the Dictionary will include &#8220;scam&#8221; in the definition.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just make sure White academic diversity-lovers are on the front lines of the receiving end of the too easy to predict Diversity Curse.<br>

		<p>I live in Nashville and was surprised that ANY media there carried that story.  Having lived all over this country, plus overseas, I have seen over and over again that especially young blacks have NO respect for anything nor anyone.  Hey, Strom thurmond and George Wallace (at least initially) were right.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The heat, the crowd, the behavior. Everything just coming together at the wrong time and you just ended up with a mess here,&#8221; said Cpt. Pardue.</p>
<p>The Affirmative Action Flunkie perdue chicken can&rsquo;t even call it what it was.  </p>
<p>To me, it looked like a large group of non-whites of which many were breaking Laws such as breaking in which, last check, was Illegal but no, twas that particular moment in time and of course, the heat that caused the crowd to break Laws.  Okay.  </p>
<p>Also, I notice there is no mention of any charges being filed.  Why?  </p>

		<p>If you google &#8220;Wave Country&#8221; you will find mostly negative reviews- most for &#8220;crime&#8221; or &#8220;gang activity&#8221;. One poor mother described her daughter&rsquo;s molestation and lack of any police investigation. I would not be surprised if this park is closed in a few years. </p>

<p>Man beaten at Davis Lake in Chickasaw County<br>
by Floyd Ingram/Chickasaw Journal Nems360.Com  The Chickasaw County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department is looking for two men involved in a fight at Davis Lake that sent their victim to intensive care in Tupelo Sunday night.</p>
<p>Chickasaw County Sheriff Jimmy Simmons said the incident began Sunday evening in the public area near the entrance to the lake and campground in northern Chickasaw County.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some kind of confrontation and a man from Pontotoc County got out of his vehicle with a baseball bat,&rdquo; said Simmons. &ldquo;While he was arguing, another man slipped up behind him and hit him in the head with some kind of metal object. When they got him on the ground they beat him with the baseball bat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simmons did not release the name of the victim. He said his department is looking for two black males at this time and the investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>Simmons said there may have been some kind of exchange of racial slurs.</p>
<p>Simmons said the victim was airlifted to Tupelo and was released from intensive care on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone who may have information on this incident or who may have witnessed it, is asked to contact the sheriff&rsquo;s department,&rdquo; said Simmons. &ldquo;At this point we understand only three people were involved but that may change.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Of all the events of black violence and criminality this past weekend, this one appears somewhat different to me in that these blacks were invading a privately owned space in which they were in no way authorized to be.  Instead of buying tickets to enter, they brazenly climbed the fence and then proceeded in a manner that sounds like the sack of Rome.  The namby-pamby tone of the article makes it sound like the only problem was the failure of youngsters to listen to instructions.<br>
There are no safe neighborhoods anymore.  Blacks will travel far and wide to invade white spaces, and they are doing so with impunity in many cases.  Many municipalities have closed down pools and rec centers because of rampant black crime and destruction of the premises.  Now the throngs are moving in on private enterprise, and the authorities seem at a loss of how to stop it.  The SBPDL website says this is going to be a summer of rampant black violence.  It sure looks that way.</p>

		<p>Like usual, blacks eventually take over just about anything open to the public and then ruin it.  I saw maybe a dozen or so Whites in this video, and why they would want to be in the water with all these blacks is beyond me(yuck!) If you want to be with blacks, you have to put up with the havoc they wreak.</p>
<p>I remember before integration when we had some very nice amusement parks, beaches, and skating rinks in the Baltimore area - all closed now after the blacks pounced on and destroyed them. The same is ringing true for most of our shopping malls. </p>
<p>Our precious few state park beaches have been taken over by hispanics, and now hordes of hispanics and blacks have discovered Ocean City, MD, running it down and making it dangerous. Most Whites that I know avoid OC altogether in favor of beaches in Maine (not eaxctly next door).  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never understand how destruction equals progress.</p>

		<p>You might as well get used to more and more of this. One of my business customers is a pools &amp; spas dealer. I commented to them the other day that it was good to see our customers doing well; that often with businesses dealing in high dollar &#8216;luxury&rsquo; or &#8216;non-essential&rsquo; items, they&rsquo;re very slow in this economy. The owner told me one of the biggest comments he hears from customers about why they&rsquo;re spending big $$ to put in a pool in their decreasing value home is that way they don&rsquo;t have to put up with the &#8216;undesirables&rsquo; and troublemakers; namely, the blacks and foreigners, and they don&rsquo;t have to deal with their germs and poor sanitary habits. He said they told him it was just too dangerous to go to public pools or water parks, and they could control what went on in their own pool.</p>

		<p>Typical scene when watching the video: most of the patrons of the water park were black, yet most of those who were trying to maintain order were white. It just always seems to sort itself out that way. Blacks enjoy the things that whites create, but they are never able to maintain them themselves. Indeed, they ultimately end up destroying them.</p>

Chicago politicians insist that North Av Beach was closed only because of &#8220;heat related illnesses&#8221; .  The high was 83 that day, only for a few hours 11/am to 3/pm.  It is always colder at the beaches due to the wind off Lake Michigan and the cooling effect of the lake.  No one has heat stroke at 83 or less degrees.</p>
<p>Here is an article denying the politically correct version of the reasons for closing the Chicago beach.</p>
<p>WLS Radio&rsquo;s Monica DeSantis Reports<br>
CHICAGO (WLS) - Was it a flash mob that forced the closure of North Avenue beach on Memorial Day?</p>
<p>Chicago Police News Affairs released a statement saying they had to close the beach for safety reasons, as people were suffering heat exhaustion and emergency vehicles couldn&rsquo;t get through to help. But, WLS listeners say there was what they called a &#8220;large gangbanger element&#8221; at the Oak Street and North Avenue beaches.</p>
<p>READ: Emanuel: Police made right call in closing beach</p>
<p>Listeners report being at the beach, and seeing dozens of gang bangers pushing people off their bikes. Another listener says those causing havoc were not dressed for the beach and looked like &#8220;bad elements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Webster&rsquo;s dictionary defines a flash mob as a group of people summoned (as by e-mail or text message) to a designated location at a specified time to perform an indicated action before dispersing. Flash mobs also can be organized via social media sites. But recently in Chicago, flash mobs have gathered along Michigan Avenue to do anything but entertain.</p>
<p>In January, groups of teens assembled along Michigan Avenue and shoplifted at three separate stores. Eleven teens ranging in age from 14 to 17 were arrested.</p>
<p>Chicago Police are denying that a flash mob intent on causing havoc forced the closure of the North Avenue beach on Memorial Day Monday.</p>

		<p>What were those White women doing taking their beautiful White children to what is an obviously black public pool?  We wouldn&rsquo;t feel the least bit worried if something awful happened and the blacks did their part to beat the bikini clad White girls out of some more of their unearned White privilege.</p>
<p>Whites who don&rsquo;t actively segregate themselves away from the black threat (Diversity Curse) should only serve us to give the moral to the dangerous Integration and violent Civil Rights horror stories that we see here every day.</p>
<p>Atlanta, the city too busy to hate, is making a feeble attempt at dealing with our expected summer &#8220;youth&#8221; crime wave.</p>
<p>Our &#8220;Kaseem&#8221; Reed very afro mayor said &#8220;We are going to lift our teens up.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s typical black talk.  Nothing they say really makes sense.  They just speak voodoo in English and assume that Anglo-Saxon accountability will leave them alone- safe bet.</p>
<p>https://www.ajc.com/news/city-officials-call-for-963275.html</p>
<p>We drove through the exclusive Buckhead community on Sun. night.  All we saw were blacks.  They were walking in groups, and wearing very bright, new clothes.  Who pays for unemployed, uneducated black &#8220;youth&#8221; to dress so fashionably?</p>
<p>One group was jumping and hooping and hollering at another group. Looked like a gang fight was about to break out. The hostility was vivid.   We swear to God Almighty up in Whitey Heaven, they were acting just like the African tribal war dancers you see on the nature TV shows- both male and females.  The females were waving their harms like they were possessed (Zul, no doubt).  They were screeching some unintelligible nonsense that only an enraged African could begin to understand.</p>
<p>It was definitely a National Geographic moment in &#8220;tony and upscale Buckhead,&#8221; right on Peachtree Street.  </p>
<p>Beware- Atlanta is one black swarm from downtown, through Midtown, Garden Hills, Buckhead, and beyond.   Don&rsquo;t drive on Peachtree Street at night, if you have dignity and self-respect. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
<p>Avoid Atlanta, and always transcend afro diversity, embrace Euro Whiteness, beware integration, prepare segregation, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your nightmares, you see it in the fear on you White daughters face when she&rsquo;s surrounded by blacks in public places&hellip; she&rsquo;s right&hellip; defend her womb from mongrelization&hellip;<br>

		<p>The White girl said &#8220;Almost trampled my kid- I just didn&rsquo;t feel safe.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Why was she ever there long enough for the blacks to start &#8220;acting out in perhaps inappropriate ways that might reflect poorly upon the community, but really call the White Community into deeper reflection of our failures to heal the wounds of segregation and prejudice&#8221;?</p>
<p>Her feeling of terror, which was genuine, was the face of the violent Civil Rights movement.  Blacks who struggle for their rights really just mau maued themselves into a position where they can frighten, intimidate, trample, rob, rape, and murder Whites without consequence.</p>
<p>She is the real villain.  Why was she exposing her White child to wild blacks?</p>
<p>We celebrate the TV station for showing the blacks jumping over the fence.  White Nashvillians will run to the gun stores tomorrow with that image in their minds.  We all fear blacks jumping over our back yard fences, and the newscast showed us all just the way it will be.  Look for the NAACP to hold a protest for the &#8220;unfortunate and shocking way that the insensitive newscast reflected poorly upon our beloved community of color.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Beyond repulsive.  This is right in the neighborhood where I grew up, and now reside in.  Folks, this place Wave Country is not in some &#8220;border&#8221; area; it&rsquo;s in a white enclave moments away from the Grand Ole Opry House.  Due to geography and roads it is sealed away from any black area.  The sighting of blacks even ten years ago around here was unusual.</p>
<p>My brother blames this black influx on the big outlet mall which was put in to replace the dearly departed Opryland USA theme park, around ten years ago or so.  For some reason it attracted lots of blacks and other third-worlders to this area.</p>
<p>The mall is now defunct due to last year&rsquo;s massive floods; but the &#8220;visitors&#8221; apparently are still flooding in.</p>
<p>This is a must-watch for any white from Donelson, TN.  Fight back or lose your heritage, and soon!</p>

		<p>Largo, MD. is the home of the Baltimore/Washington D.C. Six Flags amusement park, called Six Flags America.</p>
<p>But if you has ever been to this theme park you would call it Six Flags Africa, as the patrons are unruly minority youths&hellip;suddenly the controlling majority.</p>

		<p>Memorial Day weekend saw large scale mobs of young blacks terrorizing families and tourists in at least seven cities across the nation. Much of the details can be read on this website below.</p>
<p>Myrtle Beach, SC (Beaches and surrounding area)<br>
Carson Beach, MA (Beaches, train stations)<br>
Miami, FL (Beaches)<br>
Charlotte, NC (Downtown)<br>
Nashville, TN (Water Park)<br>
Long Beach, NY (Beaches and surrounding area)<br>
Chicago, IL (Beaches)<br>
Historically, black crime increases as the weather gets warmer. Every indication points to this being a very bad summer for black crime and riots&hellip; 1,000 &ldquo;youths&rdquo; battle each other on Carson Beach.</p>

		<p>We had similar mayhem here in Chicago on the first hot Summer night - Memorial Day. The day was fine, TNB at night.</p>
<p>My advice is to simply do the research, talk to local Whites get their inside information on when and where to expect trouble. This water park is probably fine on most summer days - Memorial Day&hellip;. no, stay away from large Black mobs. And you don&rsquo;t want your teen age daughter in a bikini to be frolicking with these types in a water park any time - think how females are protected in Islamic societies - it&rsquo;s either single sex swimming areas or women are covered up even when in a pool.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be naive, but also don&rsquo;t always be afraid, paranoid.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t go to a Nashville water park on Memorial Day, don&rsquo;t let your daughter go top-less sunbathing in the South Bronx, don&rsquo;t let down your guard and watch your Iphone on a CTA (Chicago) bus (the one stupid thing I did since moving back to Chicago).</p>
<p>Also, learn to use public space in times when there are not Black mobs - early in the morning.</p>
<p>Be smart and be safe.</p>

		<p>This story is our watershed moment of change.  We&rsquo;ve reached our pivot point of inflection.</p>
<p>While the law-abiding Whites were trying to peacefully enjoy their afternoon at the pool, swarms of blacks destroyed the security and serenity that makes good living possible for Whites.</p>
<p>While this tragedy was occurring, a great injustice was occurring in the 100% Whites Only country clubs in Nashville.  Those Whites, the ones who have an over-abundance of White Privilege, were safe and sound in their enclaves. They used their White Privilege to protect themselves and their families for the black assault, from the Diversity Curse.</p>
<p>This oppressive inequity must not stand!  Until we overturn the systemic and structural biases and bigotry of rich Whites that they used to defend themselves from what we must suffer, there will be no peace and justice and White Unity.</p>
<p>We must force the Whites who horde their White Privilege to share it more equally with the rest of us.  If most Whites can be protected from the Diversity Curse, then none should enjoy Whites Only privilege.</p>
<p>How many judges send their beautiful White daughters to private schools and private country club pools?  We need to do a race audit and find out who enforces integration and civil rights laws to our suffering, but protect themselves from the same.</p>
<p>A time for change has come.  End White Privilege Disparities! Share White Privilege Equally!  Until we are all safe, none are safe!<br>

<p>Being &#8220;part fish&#8221; during the summer onths, I completely understand your posting.  About 3 years ago, I decided that public pools had become filthy and dangerous, so I bought a 2 person kayak.  Now whenever I want to get sun-and-surf, I go to the lake, paddle around for a bit, and then drop anchor so that I may swim around.  </p>
<p>There are two pluses here: 1) I get exercise, and 2) there are no non-Whites on the lake.  Just a few good ol boys fishing, and a few sailboats.  </p>

		<p>Poster 13 said: &#8220;Our precious few state park beaches have been taken over by hispanics&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;   Same thing where I&rsquo;m at!  I no longer go to the local public beaches because they have BEEN TAKEN OVER by latinos.  I am not kidding.  Wall to Wall Mexico and Dominican Republic at every beach - even those in out of the way places!  </p>
<p>The last couple of times I took my family to our favorite local beaches, we were inundated with loud latino music, roving bands of soccer players (on the sand), endless trash and nary a word of English heard.  Did I mention the dirty stares?  I&rsquo;m getting a backyard pool this summer.  No more third world beaches for me.</p>

		<p>If you are a water enthusiast, try sailing. Lessons and membership to sailing clubs cost as much as a weekend getaway. You can rent a fairly large sailboat, and bring your family for an adventure they will never forget. Sailing on the high seas, swimming in remote bays and islands, etc. This activity is almost exclusively white, middle class. It takes intellectual and physical effort, and just enough money to keep the thugs of the earth out. We did this recently in a crime infested, diverse coastal city in California. The marina area and the places we visited were almost all white, with a few well-behaved minorities. If you have a little extra money to spend, try this activity for an escape. Safe, clean, public pools are like safe public schools&hellip;a quaint past memory.</p>

		<p>I find it so strange. During WW1, my grandfather was in a nation of Bantus&hellip;Haiti&hellip;He and his Marine buddies subdued them for all their brutality. Now we can not control them in this country. By the way, their juju didn&rsquo;t work well against Marine standard issue weaponry. Even at close quarters they were no match for those white lads. </p>

		<p>Seems like some of you don&rsquo;t get what this is about.  Donelson, TN is a brick-house middle class area.  No mansions or gated crap anywhere nearby, for many miles.  The reason it has remained mostly white has to do with geography and roads.  Not &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.  The PC liberals have tried to force blacks in here for a long time.  Of course South Nashville blacks have been bussed to our schools since the early 70&rsquo;s.  Yet Donelson remains mostly devoid of them as residents.</p>
<p>What this is amounts to is an invasion.</p>

		<p>I wonder what would have happened if each white patron interviewed would have told the truth.  One person would have been demonized and sued for spreading &#8220;racist hate.&#8221;  The liberal pukes cannot do that to one hundred people telling the truth.  Here was the perfet opportunity.  A mountain of undisputible video evidence could have been backed up by hundreds of whites telling the truth.  Oh wait, I&rsquo;m an idiot, it would have never made the news with people telling the truth.  Sorry for wasting your time reading my rant. </p>

		<p>Everyone knows you can not put that many black people in one place and expect civility! I have even had black people tell me this to be fact!</p>
<p>Remember, Blacks want to live with whites! You do not see white people trying to get into the hood to buy a house.</p>
<p>It has always been like that. They wanted to drink out of the white water fountain, Ride the same bus, Go to the white schools, date white women.</p>
<p>That is what they want. They move in and we move out. They move in and we move out! Over and over again.</p>
<p>They do not even like living amoungest themselves!</p>
<p>Weave country happened again the other night at Centenial Park when they tried to have a Free movie night.</p>
<p>You have got to raise prices to stop the hood from working its way into these nice places. It is unfortunate but we must pay higher prices for entertainment to not have to put up with the hood. They ruin everything.</p>

&#8220;What were those White women doing taking their beautiful White children to what is an obviously black public pool? We wouldn&rsquo;t feel the least bit worried if something awful happened and the blacks did their part to beat the bikini clad White girls out of some more of their unearned White privilege.</p>
<p>Whites who don&rsquo;t actively segregate themselves away from the black threat (Diversity Curse) should only serve us to give the moral to the dangerous Integration and violent Civil Rights horror stories that we see here every day.</p>
<p>Atlanta, the city too busy to hate, is making a feeble attempt at dealing with our expected summer &ldquo;youth&rdquo; crime wave.</p>
<p>Our &ldquo;Kaseem&rdquo; Reed very afro mayor said &ldquo;We are going to lift our teens up.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s typical black talk. Nothing they say really makes sense. They just speak voodoo in English and assume that Anglo-Saxon accountability will leave them alone- safe bet.</p>
<p>https://www.ajc.com/news/city-officials-call-for-963275.html</p>
<p>We drove through the exclusive Buckhead community on Sun. night. All we saw were blacks. They were walking in groups, and wearing very bright, new clothes. Who pays for unemployed, uneducated black &ldquo;youth&rdquo; to dress so fashionably?</p>
<p>One group was jumping and hooping and hollering at another group. Looked like a gang fight was about to break out. The hostility was vivid. We swear to God Almighty up in Whitey Heaven, they were acting just like the African tribal war dancers you see on the nature TV shows- both male and females. The females were waving their harms like they were possessed (Zul, no doubt). They were screeching some unintelligible nonsense that only an enraged African could begin to understand.</p>
<p>It was definitely a National Geographic moment in &ldquo;tony and upscale Buckhead,&rdquo; right on Peachtree Street. </p>
<p>Beware- Atlanta is one black swarm from downtown, through Midtown, Garden Hills, Buckhead, and beyond. Don&rsquo;t drive on Peachtree Street at night, if you have dignity and self-respect. You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
<p>Avoid Atlanta, and always transcend afro diversity, embrace Euro Whiteness, beware integration, prepare segregation, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your nightmares, you see it in the fear on you White daughters face when she&rsquo;s surrounded by blacks in public places&hellip; she&rsquo;s right&hellip; defend her womb from mongrelization&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bravo NPNM. You said it all brilliantly and so eloquently.<br>
There will be a reckoning and it will start with those of our own who&rsquo;ve betrayed us and sold us out. The murders, rapes and other atrocities will land on their doorsteps. And they&rsquo;ll come to us beggin for succor. There will be a conflict and it&rsquo;ll be a terrible one; the tragedy being that it didn&rsquo;t have to end the way it will.</p>
