<h1>Why Whites Avoid Movies with Black Actors</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Jacobs, Miller-McCune, May 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Morris noted, nonwhite actors played major roles in only two of the 30 top-grossing films of 2010. Studio executives believe white audiences prefer to see white characters, while black audiences want to see black characters, so they increasingly make films for each demographic.</p>
<p>Are they being too cynical? Newly published research suggests the answer is, sadly, no. But it also suggests this troubling tendency may largely be the effect of the studios&rsquo; all-too-effective marketing strategies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Andrew Weaver of the Indiana University Department of Telecommunications explored how the racial makeup of the cast impacts the preferences of white filmgoers. Writing in the Journal of Communication, he described an experiment in which 68 white college undergraduates read 12 fictional synopses of new romantic comedies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Web pages were created for each movie, and the race of the characters was manipulated to create six versions: an all-white cast; a 70 percent white cast with two white leads; a 70 percent white cast with a white and a black lead; a 70 percent black cast with a white and a black lead; a 70 percent black cast with two black leads; and an all-black cast,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The higher the percentage of black actors in the movie, the less interested white participants were in seeing the movie,&#8221; Weaver reports. &#8220;Importantly, this effect occurred regardless of participants&rsquo; racial attitudes or actors&rsquo; relative celebrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>A separate study that used the same technique to assess non-romantic films produced different results. For the participants, 79 white undergraduates, the race of the actors did not influence their desire to see the film.</p>
<p>But a follow-up study by Weaver, which has yet to be published, suggests that result may be an outlier. In it, he used the same technique, but his participants were drawn from a more diverse group in terms of age and education. Specifically, he analyzed the responses of 150 white people between the ages of 18 and 69.</p>
<p>&#8220;White participants were more interested in seeing films with white actors than films with black actors,&#8221; he found. &#8220;This main effect was quite robust, occurring regardless of gender, age, previous movie viewing or the genre of the movie.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the actors&rsquo; race did have a big impact on another issue: Whether the participants felt they were part of the &#8220;intended audience&#8221; for the film. Their likelihood to agree decreased significantly when 70 percent (or 100 percent) of the cast was black, and they were less likely to express interest in seeing those films.</p>
<p>This suggests to Weaver that white reluctance to see films with black actors can be overcome. The perception that &#8220;this movie is not for me&#8221; could be changed &#8220;if more mainstream movies cast minorities,&#8221; he writes. If multiracial casts became the norm and movies were marketed to all demographics, the stigma could fade away.</p>

<p>In fact, the movie industry is overcoming it.  It is overcoming it in the same way that the media in general is &#8220;overcoming it&#8221;.  They&rsquo;re doing it very slowly.  Naturally White people want to see White actors.  It&rsquo;s only natural.  However, this slow conditioning from decade to decade and from generation to generation is slowly changing us.  &#8220;Their&#8221; media is causing more and more miscegenation, more and more of a decline in the overall White birth rate, more feminism, which in itself, causes a decline in the birthrate - almost always just the White birth rate - simply because White women are so vulnerable to feminist ideology, more and more legal and illegal immigrants, the vast majority of whom are non-White, and if allowed to progress unchecked indefinitely, will result in our extinction.  Then their &#8220;problem&#8221; will be solved - FOREVER.</p>

I see that the &#8216;experiments&rsquo; were done on whites. I don&rsquo;t see that the same &#8216;experiments&rsquo; were done on blacks. Either this is a racist white problem or the bias of the researchers is showing.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If multiracial casts became the norm and movies were marketed to all demographics, the stigma could fade away.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Many people like the entertainment movies provide. If every film was multiracial and people had no choice, of course they would go to  see these films. Would it make the films better? Would it drive some people away?<br>

<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t want to watch &#8216;authentic&rsquo; black charactors or those tokenized progressive black charactors who show up in &#8216;ensemble casts&rsquo; such as the computor nerd, the scholarly professor or female judge cliches which just push the suspension of disbelief concept too far. </p>

		<p>Odd that this study was focused on the White response to movies with various percentages of black actors and yet they dont seem concerned with how blacks feel about movies with White actors. Must have been an oversight. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;..This suggests to Weaver that white reluctance to see films with black actors can be overcome&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
These folks always concern themselves with rooting out and destroying White &#8220;racism&#8221; wherever it may be. I guess it never occured to these geniuses that all races, INCLUDING WHITES, prefer to see their own kind on the big/little screen. Had they bothered to study black&rsquo;s reaction to movie racial makeup, my bet is blacks would have been even more discriminatory about what movies they wanted to see, based on the cast&rsquo;s racial makeup. I&rsquo;m sure blacks would have overwhelmingly preferred movies with mainly a black cast. And I don&rsquo;t see a thing in the world wrong with that. </p>

		<p>Wow, brilliant! Of course,  the solution to white audiences not liking black actors is to have even more black actors.</p>
<p>Lets see how that works at the box office&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>Am I the only one who noticed the leap of fallacy this statement engenders?  First the researcher notes that non-white casts don&rsquo;t speak to white audiences and their sense of &#8216;it was made for me.&rsquo;  Then he notes in a study that especially in romantic films, whites and blacks only want to see their own races respectively in the leads.  Then he makes the strange leap that if casts were more multiracial, all the objections would be overcome.  That&rsquo;s some mischaracterization of his own findings.  &#8220;Just show more black people and white people will come on board.&#8221;  His research conclusion was the opposite!</p>
<p>There are a few black actors that whites accept in close supporting roles like halle berrie, and even fewer in lead roles, and those are all action/comedy flicks.  (Will smith, denzel Wash. and Chris Rock) but that&rsquo;s because they know how to reach out to white people, not just black people.</p>
<p>The article also focused mostly on whites and presented them as bigoted for not wanting to watch &#8216;jumping the broom&rsquo; and such.  What about black attitudes towards white movies?  I like to watch kung fu movies full of asians.  Am I not open minded enough?</p>

		<p>Quite correct.  I&rsquo;m quite fussy about who gets to join me in my living room, not to mention having anti white propaganda spewed at me in my own space!<br>
The sooner movie / sitcom producers get to realise this fact the sooner they&rsquo;ll have longer running shows and larger audiences.<br>
The BBC has yet to learn this as many well accepted shows have become less white their ratings take a dive and the shows are withdrawn. eg  &#8216;The Bill&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I am the guy this story was written about! I cannot see a movie where the characters are so mis-cast or the story is advancing a social agenda simply by inserting black actors in obviously white rolls. I haven&rsquo;t seen a movie with blacks in prominent rolls in many years, just as I don&rsquo;t watch disney fantasys, my imagination is no longer that flexible.  A black actor on the poster of a coming movie in the lobby is all it takes for me to write that movie off, regardless of any other aspects, such as story, personal interests etc.  for me, black actors cannot transcend their reality, it&rsquo;s a constant game of &#8220;what&rsquo;s wrong with this picture&#8221; </p>
<p>I am not overtly racist, and if i had to describe myself in one word it would be realist.</p>

		<p>Articles such as this one clearly display how loony many liberals are.  First we&rsquo;re told that whites are reluctant to see movies with interracial casting and then told that the cure is for filmmakers to make movies with interracial casting!  And just how many decades now have we been accosted with everything from black/white buddy flicks to black/white romances?  Almost every mainstream movie has to have at least one or two token black characters.  And yet, what is the outcome?  Black folks like to see movies about black folks, and ditto for whites.  <br>
I recently saw a documentary about the huge Nigerian film industry, which has been dubbed Nollywood.  Cheap quickie flicks are cranked out and sold on video to buyers all over black Africa.  Every actor seen in this film was black and, in the case of female romantic leads, almost always light-skinned, just like in the &#8220;race films&#8221; of the American past.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve personally found many movies about black people that I enjoy, but I don&rsquo;t like watching films with token characters, regardless of whether they are racial minorities, gays, Moslems, or whatever.  Similarly, I wouldn&rsquo;t like a black movie to have an incongruous token white character either.  </p>

		<p>Personally I was never fond of all those black sitcom on TV either.</p>
<p>White folks when making an appearance were always portrayed as dumb, nerdy, saying stupid dumb things, etc. Made to look silly in contrast to the black persons on the sitcom.</p>
<p>Sanford &amp; Son - - the white cop always saying stupid things that had to be translated for the black folks.</p>
<p>Good Times - - whites were always nerdy, wearing thick glasses, acting silly and goofy, in contrast to the manly James.</p>
<p>Jeffersons - - whitey were gangsters George was always getting the better of, and the doorman constantly wanting a tip, the white husband of Roxie Rooker always saying stupid things and the  white guy who was supposed to be the English UN employee always saying stupid things.</p>
<p>Cosby - - Madelaine Kahn always saying stupid things.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>Never did like those programs.</p>

<p>Ah, what a good little Young Pioneer, Comrade Weaver is!</p>
<p>His &ldquo;studies&rdquo; are all utterly flawed, unless their goal is explicitly to figure out ways to brainwash whites into seeing and celebrating blacks in movies, as viable alternatives to that which is seen (and rightfully so) as normal and familiar by them. In short, they are designed to cultivate and maximize multicultural propaganda, as an effective tool for the genocide of the white race, primarily through &ldquo;self inflicted&rdquo; means and the eradication of white identity/racial consciousness. They are not comparative studies designed to look at &ldquo;integrating&rdquo; the movie going public into a uniform &ldquo;multiracial&rdquo; mosaic, that rejects the &ldquo;social construct&rdquo; of race when selecting entertainment.</p>
<p>As with all things that are twisted or fabricated to fit into the multicultural paradigm (or paradox, as it is in reality,) a one-way street embarked upon, with the goal of &ldquo;enriching&rdquo; the white race via manipulated humiliation and calculated self-hatred. This is old news, of course; however, it is given the new and more blatant &ldquo;luster&rdquo; of being obnoxiously obvious!</p>
<p>Thus, television is truly an idiot box, even if HDTV flattened into &ldquo;mini-movie&rdquo; screens; cinemas are the holdouts and cultic indoctrination factories, for the intellectually challenged that require howling peer &ldquo;support,&rdquo;  before engaging diversity as a &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; dihminitude!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p> &#8220;This movie is not for me?&#8221; How about, &#8220;This neighborhood is not for me&#8221;? It&rsquo;s the same principal. I, for one, don&rsquo;t care for these movies that ALWAYS have to have a black character who is (of course) smarter, cooler, more athletic, and &#8220;sexier&#8221; (to the White chicks, presumably) than the White lead.</p>
<p> Watching &#8220;Song of the South,&#8221; on the other hand, is refreshing and a great movie experience. But I have no use for the &#8220;Shaft&#8221; type movies. I want the good guys to look like me. And since blacks obviously want the &#8220;good guys&#8221; to look like them in their movies, then why is this race identification by Whites something to be &#8220;overcome,&#8221; in the opinion of the writer, when the same thing is not said about blacks&rsquo; preference for black actors? I wonder, I wonder &hellip;</p>

		<p>The international market is vastly more important in terms of revenue than the US market.  This includes DVD&rsquo;s and television.</p>
<p>Blacks, even Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, Denzel Washington and others who are stars in the US totally bomb in the international market.</p>
<p>Blacks are especially unpopular in Asia and Latin America for some reason.</p>
<p>It is not the job of the entertainment industry to force international audiences to buy tickets for movies they don&rsquo;t want to see.</p>
<p>As Louis Mayer once said &#8220;If they don&rsquo;t want to see your movie, they won&rsquo;t see it.&#8221;   Another wonderful quote, &#8220;Wanna send a message? heard of the Post Office, Western Union, phone company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Movies are to make money for millions of employees and businesses from the popcorn oil producers to the talent.  If they can&rsquo;t make money from blacks, they won&rsquo;t cast black actors.</p>

<p>So the solution is to make all Hollywood movies multicultural so people won&rsquo;t have a choice of what they want to watch and they assume people will go to these?  There&rsquo;s always classic movies and foreign films.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Then again, the enormous success of Fast Five, which made more than $83 million domestically in its first weekend of release, may inspire other producers to take a risk on multiracial casts  &mdash;  perhaps even for films in which the real stars aren&rsquo;t the cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>More multiracial casts?  Is this dork living in a cave or what?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that all we&rsquo;re seeing practically nowadays?  If not, you could have fooled me.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t watch a movie with blacks as any of the main characters.  There&rsquo;s nothing that the Hollywood dregs can do to makle me watch them either.</p>

<p>Why??? Why does&rsquo;t &#8220;black reluctance&#8221; to see films with WHITE actors need to be &#8220;overcome&#8221;? The whole article was about how WHITEY needs to change! The blacks can continue to see all\mostly black actors, but WHITEY &#8216;muss&rsquo; watch White AND black!<br>
To this day I still fail to understand why liberals think its so important to force blacks on Whites. I don&rsquo;t WANT to experience &#8220;different&#8221; cultures on screen or off! I can think of countless examples where blacks benefit from being around Whites ( thats why blacks follow Whites wherever we go ), but I fail to see where Whites benefit from being around blacks ( which is why we NEVER follow them anywhere ). And of course the instant blacks move to a White neighborhood they start the ol &#8220;dey all be racisss up in here&#8221; nonsense.    </p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to alienate me from a movie when it comes to race. Just the tiniest snip of dialogue will do it. There was the Woody Allen movie where he talked about a women &#8220;with a pretty little up-turned nose&#8221;. That was the last Woody Allen movie I ever watched. Another time I was watching a TV cop show. Two detectives, black and white, were in a store buying munchies for an all-night stakeout.

I remember attending a Midwestern college (hey, just like Mr. Weaver) thinking about how much better the world will be once my enlightened generation steps in to fill the shoes of the racist generation who preceded us.</p>
<p>Since then there has been time as a courier in Chicago, shaking off the innocence. Time in the military, getting really pissed about having to do two people&rsquo;s jobs because my CO was forbidden from firing the only non-white in the unit, who just happened to be a moron to the point of being truly dangerous (&lsquo;Sorry Bill&rsquo;). Time in a black DC neighborhood low on gas, going to the service station with the police car thinking it would be safe. Only to find the cop investigating  some dead guy with a hole in his head lying in a pool of blood. Time walking around Detroit, looking at the ruins. Time watching my current community&rsquo;s demographics change and getting to help fund our town&rsquo;s first graffiti removal and gang units with my taxes. Time viewing the hateful looks from groups of &lsquo;youths&rsquo; as I walk the streets of my town.</p>
<p>If my life experience is at all typical, Mr. Weaver&rsquo;s premise is flawed. The more white people are exposed to blacks, the less they like them.</p>

		<p>Once again, the liberals totally MISS THE OBVIOUS.  Ever been to a movie that drew a LOT of blacks into the audience?  Was it enjoyable?  I think blacks actually behave worse in movie theaters than they do in the streets.  Loud, unruly, often violent, disruptive, chattering away, cell phones going, yelling, etc etc etc.  When whites see a certain proportion of blacks cast in a movie (like, for instance, more than ONE) they focus on WHO the movie likely will draw.  Certainly with a cast of 70 percent black, you can bet the audience will be almost entirely blacks.  WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would willingly subject themselves to a theater full of unruly blacks?  Even completely brainwashed White Liberals wouldn&rsquo;t go to see a movie with a nearly all black cast watched by an all black audience.<br>
They might RENT the movie when it comes out so they can watch it and make themselves feel oh-so-unracist, but they would NEVER subject themselves to an audience full of blacks whatever the movie.  No White wants to.  Not even the whites that are gleefully doing all they can to make whites the minority.  </p>
<p>And this guy&rsquo;s solution is to make movies with MORE blacks in them?  What an idiot.<br>
Doesn&rsquo;t matter how intelligent and miscast the black actors are portrayed to be unlike typical blacks.  All Whites KNOW what the audience will be composed of - blacks - and will avoid it at all costs.</p>

		<p>Hollywood surely has known for a long time that Whites prefer to see Whites in movies.  Non-Whites  nevertheless are always cast in every modern movie.  This is for the purposes of social propaganda.  Note that even when the non-White actor plays a minor role, it is nearly always sympathetic (e.g.: skilled doctor or starship commander).</p>

		<p>&#8220;If my life experience is at all typical, Mr. Weaver&rsquo;s premise is flawed. The more white people are exposed to blacks, the less they like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are correct; if Hollywood were willing to portray blacks as they are, instead of some fictionalized &#8220;wunderschwartz&#8221;.</p>
<p>From K-7th grades I grew up in the farmland of northern Ohio. Excellent education and quite frankly not a single black in any of the schools I attended. My only impression of blacks was that on TV and the movies, e.g. the Cosby&rsquo;s etc. My head was also pumped full of equality nonsense and how oppressed these people were. <br>
In the 8th grade, I moved to an urban school full of blacks; and quickly had my illusions completely and thoroughly shattered. </p>
<p>My parents refused to believe me when I described how awful the school was to them -they assumed that I was &#8216;pulling the long bow&rsquo; because I missed my friends or some such, as they were both raised in black-free environments for the most part, and the few blacks that they had come into contact with were the extreemly genteel, college educated one-in-a-million variety.</p>
<p>In time, both came to their own moments of &#8216;awakening&rsquo; -my father when he was invited to a similar school to give a presentation and could not get through five minutes -my mother when she took a job that took her out of her insulated bubble and put her in contact with more garden-variety specimines of &#8216;those-poor-oppressed-people-who-are-just-like-you-or-me&rsquo;</p>
<p>You are correct, the more contact whites have with blacks, the more people awaken from the fog of propaganda and lies; which is why H-Wood is striving so very hard in their progrom (it is not misspelled, I meant it in the Stalinst definition) and why the omnidirectional sewage pump they euphemistically call television represents blacks exactly as they do -instead of as they are.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if a movie opened with a simple display of the factual statistics of how many whites are raped by blacks every year in this country? Some of us, I know, have seen &#8220;Das Boot&#8221; where in the opening credits, they horrify the audience with 30,000 out of 40,000 never returned&hellip; DOJ stats for last year alone were in the ballpark of what, 33,000?<br>

<p>Shaw made millions from his books, plays and movies&hellip; but he didn&rsquo;t see any contradiction with being a socialist.  Every one of his plays  (many made into movies) carries a  particular message.  He was instructing while entertaining.</p>

<p>This nonsense has been going on for a long time. A retired BBC official confessed a few years ago that in the 1950s they had a policy that they called &#8220;blonking&#8221;.

The idea was that blacks were shown as often as possible, without regard to relevance, in backgrounds, just to get people used to seeing blacks in public.

		<p>Hollywood has had the recipe for making money from minority leading men for the last 70 years. All they need to do is make movies where the hero is not a muscle bound sex machine, pathological freak, white hating, race mixing cartoon character. Here is the way to cast him. Be a good family man, be really smart,be crazily ironic,be a real family values person not a phoney baloney republican Bible thumper and have a great script. My childhood hero was and still is Charlie Chan. The closest to him is the guy who starred with Mel Gibson in those &#8221; Lethal Weapon&#8221; movies&#8221; and  &#8221; Predator &#8221; 2-10. In the past 39 years I quoted Charlie Chan more often than Abe Lincoln and I quoted Lincoln a lot. When I was prosecuting the creep would always say he had learned his lesson. I would then say, &#8221; As Charlie Chan said, &#8221; Experience is the best teacher but sometimes the tuition takes a lifetime to pay.&#8221;<br>

<p>Really is true isn&rsquo;t it?  I HATE those black sitcoms!  I remember when Fred Sanford said &#8220;there is nothing uglier than an old White woman&#8221;!  Has he seen some of these old black women and men? Such as himself? </p>
<p> All In the Family is another one I detest!  But with that anti-White commie lefty Rob Reiner in it really took the cake&hellip;but then all we have to look at is the producer of that series, Norman Lear, another commie. Anything to put down Whites and glorify other races. Being a White &#8220;racist&#8221; is the worst offender of them all, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>Will there be follow up studies with blacks asked if they would like to see movies with a movie theater that is 70 or 100 percent white with a 70 to 100 percent white cast?</p>
<p>The audience it is intended for is the audience the movie draws. <br>
Most whites, even if they would enjoy something like &#8220;Tyler Perry&rsquo;s Madea Goes To The Waterpark&#8221; don&rsquo;t want to go into a dark room with 200 black strangers. And vice versa.</p>

		<p>There are two points worth mentioning that I think the study has failed to touch on.<br>
1. More often than not, when you watch a movie that may have one or more blacks being in the lead, you will time and time again have to experience how freely the media allows said black actors to degrade their White counterparts. Whether it be the &#8220;subservient, White idiot&#8221; who needs a dose of black wisdom, or the black characters whining about there black plight at the hands of the evil, tyrannical White Devil.<br>
2. If you ever have been to a movie theater that has a large black attendance, you will know right away that you have wasted your money. They will talk on their phones and to each other, regardless of how far away they are away from each other in the theater, just as loud as they would everywhere else. I have seen them climb over the seats to find a friend. I have also seen them all together get out of their seats and congregated in the aisles so they can talk.<br>
Going to the movies is not very cheap venture now days, especially if you are taking the whole family. If you are paying that kind of money, the least you should expect is an environment in which you can enjoy the movie you paid for.</p>

		<p>The Blacks shown in movies are often cast in completely unbelieveable and unrealistic roles. If they act White, they&rsquo;re a fraud. If they act normal for Blacks, they are viewed as clowns and social misfits.</p>
<p>Can anyone really look at a Black &#8220;professional&#8221; and trust that he actually earned his was beyond affirmative action?</p>
<p>Legitimate Black mathematicians, engineers, doctors, and scientists with real credentials are unusual and unrealistic. The White public knows that and does not care to see that charade played out at the movies.</p>

		<p>Last night, I accidently landed on a new show called &#8220;Hellcats&#8221; while channel surfing.  A pretty white girl was sleazily seducing a black male basketball player in a locker room.  The scene was like porn with clothing on, initiated by a gross ombisural mismatch.  She got busted by an &#8220;in charge&#8221; woman of color, who ran her our of &#8220;her&#8221; locker room, but the sleazy white girl gave the black as the ace of spades black her phone number first.  My wife and I were disgusted on several levels besides the obvious one, and quickly changed the channel.  This programmed in propaganda/brainwashing is insulting as well as demeaning to whites.  Young white women are too often typified as easily accessible tramps for non-whites.</p>

 And yet Hollywood STILL doesn&rsquo;t understand why their new movie profit yields continue to shrink.<br>
 Build and stock your home media library while you can. Many of the classic, pro-white, pro-classic values, traditional family films are virtually impossible to find, even today. It will get worse. </p>

		<p>I am sick and tired of films where the criminals are usually white (how laughable) and TV commercials that depict whites as dimwitted and backward, but the blacks are smart and savvy (another laughable unreality).  One of the facts not considered by this clueless egalitarian egghead is how many white people are going to attend a movie theater filled with mostly black patrons?  I know I won&rsquo;t be one of them.  I can imagine what an experience that would be with all the filthy language, talking while the movie is playing, calling on cellphones, walking around, and lack of courtesy to others so many blacks are known for.  It would probably show up on some local news station about a &#8220;Man Beaten by Mob at Theater for Asking Patron to Be Quiet During Movie.&#8221;  It would never show up on national news thanks to the Obama cheerleaders known as the mainstream media.  You&rsquo;d later find out that the man was white and the assailants were black.  I try to stay away from blacks as much as possible and avoid places they frequent and hang out.  Having a multicultural cast won&rsquo;t change that either.  People will simply stop attending movies.</p>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t avoid a movie because the lead is black.   I will avoid a movie if there are more than 3 black people in line.  Because I won&rsquo;t be able to hear a word of the film because blacks in a theatre in large groups are pathologically incapable of shutting the heck up.   And if you say anything to them, you&rsquo;ll just be a victim of another many on one black on white gang beating.  </p>

<p>But back to the subject. I remember watching both Jurassic park movies in the 90&rsquo;s,. The 1st has a select few black heads in the audience (probably cause Samuel l. jackson was in it) but when &#8220;The Lost world&#8221; came out&hellip;not a single black head in the audience, it was all whites&hellip;it hit me right at that moment when I realized there wasn&rsquo;t a lead or even a supporting black actor in the movie. <br>
And the Nutty professor i saw when first came out in theatres&hellip;out of nearly 180-200 people in the theatre, me and my friend were the only whites in there. </p>

<p>I also work in the entertainment industry.  #19 is absolutely right.  It&rsquo;s the international market where both gross and net profit are made and it&rsquo;s the international market that shuns blacks.</p>
<p>The professor, instead of researching American Whites needs to focus on the international market.  Whoever gave him his grant?<br>
It&rsquo;s similiar to a bird seed manufacturer doing research on why dogs don&rsquo;t eat birdseed, or a clothing manufacturer funding research on why Africans don&rsquo;t need artic parkas, boots and gloves from LL Bean.</p>
<p>The fact that the professor chose to focus on American Whites who do watch black actors instead of international audiences that refuse to watch black actors is just one more proof of the total stupidity of the liberal professoriate.</p>
<p>It is so obviouis he knows absolutely nothing about the movie end of the entertainment industry.  All he had to do was ask anyone in Los Angeles.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t watch movies where Blacks play a prominent role. If a leading character acts retarded in a film, it pretty much ruins the flow of the plot.  For example, the leading character can&rsquo;t spend half his time listening to &#8220;hip-hop&#8221; and the other half standing in a fast food line. So it should be obvious to anyone why Blacks don&rsquo;t get the main role in a film. It&rsquo;s because the main role character usually leads a very, very exciting life, and as a result faces challenges that everyday Blacks simply don&rsquo;t. Of course, there are specific movies geared just for Blacks, where the main (Black)character displays subpar intelligence, but these movies never ever win Oscars. </p>

The reality is that White men very rarely find a beautiful black woman, &amp; the ones out there are with a handsome black guy, as they should be. </p>
<p>I was watching a tv show on Nick jr. My daughter is 19 months old. There was a scene in this cartoon rhat showed a family of &#8220;water drops&#8221; &amp; a family of &#8220;oil drops&#8221;.

<p>&#8220;Slumdog Millionaire&#8221; was an excellent movie.  One of the best I have ever seen.  </p>
<p>However, it was very deeply disturbing about how the film revealed that begging gangs in India, and probably elsewhere in that part of the world, mutilate,  maim, and disable the children they recruit.  Tragic, but well done and worth my time to see it.</p>
<p>I do not know how it is in India&rsquo;s prisons.  But in any prison in America, if a criminal gang that mutilated, maimed and disabled the children they recruited, and if such a criminal gang was caught, tried, and convicted. Upon being sent to any of our prisons, they would face real justice from the other prison inmates!</p>

		<p>I tune out when seeing a movie trailer with too &#8220;diverse&#8221; a cast. (Then again, most contemporary Hollywood movies are not worth watching whatever the performers&rsquo; ethnicities).<br>
  Occasionally an ironic situations arises, where a movie reinforces ethnic and racial stereotypes without any likely conscious intent on the part of its makers. A good example is the recent indie film, &#8220;Atlas Shrugged: Part I&#8221;. Though Jewish, the novel&rsquo;s author, Ayn Rand, populated it exclusively with Nordic type characters (both heroes and villains)   &mdash;  - not surprising, since it was written in the 1950s. Even the key &#8220;Latino&#8221; character, Francisco d&rsquo;Anconia, is clearly of European-Argentinian background; the only clear exception is an American-Indian judge. <br>
  The movie, however, is a different story. though the vast majority of characters are White, an important supporting character   &mdash;  - Eddie Willers, Dagny Taggart&rsquo;s loyal but lackluster assistant   &mdash;  - is an African (in the book he&rsquo;s clearly described as being blond and blue-eyed). The irony here is that the Willers character, while honest, competent and principled, is a mediocrity who doesn&rsquo;t have the Randian &#8220;Right Stuff&#8221;: he isn&rsquo;t invited to Atlantis, is a loser romantically, and in the end is left to perish on an abandoned train on the prairies amid the final collpase of the welfare state (&#8220;USSA&#8221; as it were). What a role to give the movie&rsquo;s most prominent non-White! Also, the White actor playing James Taggart   &mdash;  - as evil as his sister is good   &mdash;  - is far too handsome for the role; while some of the novel&rsquo;s linchpin wealth-redistributing, Obama-Czar type baddies, are played by actors who are Jewish or Italian-American. In another hilarious casting twist, the novel&rsquo;s Evil Scientist (one of John Galt&rsquo;s mentors who betrays him), and who sells his soul for State funding, is named Robert Stadler (possibly Jewish), and was actually modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer   &mdash;  - whom Rand (when a Hollywood screenwriter) interviewed for a piece on the atomic bomb. The makers of the movie, however, saw fit to cast in that role&hellip; an Iranian!!<br>

		<p>Heck, you don&rsquo;t have to go to the movies to notice a trend toward featuring more non-whites&hellip;just turn on your TV. The last several years I&rsquo;ve noticed more advertising commercials featuring mostly minorities.</p>
<p>I have always wondered what happened to MTV in the late 1980&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s like overnight the programming went from mainstream music programming to all rap music. I quit watching after that. I thought I remember hearing something about BET buying the network around that time but have never been able to confirm it.</p>
