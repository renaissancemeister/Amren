<h1>U.N.-Backed Summit Seeks &#8216;Social Justice&rsquo; for African Descendants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan Jones, CNS News, May 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Only three months to go until the First World Summit of African Descendants, a U.N.-sponsored event that aims to &#8220;right historical wrongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The August 18-21 summit in La Ceiba, Honduras, will focus on the socioeconomic conditions of Afro-descendant populations and establish a plan to &#8220;ensure development with equity for these groups,&#8221; said the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), which announced the event in Washington on Thursday.</p>
<p>The event is part of the United Nations-declared International Year of African Descendants.</p>
<p>&#8220;This International Year of African Descendants provides an opportunity to right historical wrongs: in health, education, poverty, land rights, jobs, and financial credit for economic and social progress,&#8221; said Pan American Health Organization Director Mirta Roses in a news release. &#8220;This celebration is important for recognizing the strength and resilience of Afro-descendant communities throughout the Americas, who have thrived despite historical discrimination and repression.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Health, contraceptives and social justice</strong></p>
<p>According to PAHO/WHO, compared with Caucasians, the babies of African descendants are more likely to die, their mothers face more risks in childbirth, adult men have higher rates of homicide and HIV, and adolescents are more likely to become pregnant.</p>
<p>At the same time, &#8220;equal access to health services and contraceptives remains a challenge,&#8221; said Dr. Roses. &#8220;This year is a time to celebrate the power of Afro-descendant organizations in challenging and changing these inequalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The summit will provide an opportunity to analyze international cooperation and &#8220;close the existing development gaps through concrete commitments, clear strategies, and adequate resources,&#8221; said Jorge Ramón Hernández Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the Americas&rsquo; pending debts is to &#8220;put an end to historical and structural discrimination against African descendants,&#8221; said Santiago Cantón, executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). He said initiatives such as the summit are &#8220;essential steps&#8221; toward ending such discrimination. He said the summit will raise awareness of violations of the human rights of African descendants, and thereby help put an end to them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Álvarez Casildo said the summit was expected to conclude with a &#8220;Declaration of the Decade of African Descendants and the creation of a new fund for Afro-descendant Development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The summit is not the end, it&rsquo;s a means for transformation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s an extremely important medium to ensure that these voices no longer remain silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just a few months ago, blacks and liberal whites were claiming that Planned Parenthood was opening clinics in American ghettos to foster black genocide through the encouragement of abortion.  Of course, the real reason PP put clinics in those &#8220;hoods&#8221; was to combat the out-of-control STD problem.  </p>

		<p>I had to look at the date of this article, and my eyes weren&rsquo;t fooling me.  It was indeed written on May 27, 2011.  Because the body reads like something that was written sixty years ago, and written by people who are unaware that the American Federal government has almost completely wrecked a proper relationship between state and Federal government, the proper definition of Federalism, the proper relationship between citizen and state, and fiscal and logical sanity, to implement program after program, scheme after scheme, idea after idea, from ending &#8220;Jim Crow,&#8221; to affirmative action, to civil rights and voting rights acts, to innumerate welfare programs, explicitly or implicitly, to pumping insane amounts of money into schools to find away to end the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;   &mdash;   I could go on and on.  All these things have happened already, and yet, the &#8220;problem&#8221; is still bad enough in the eyes of the people who call 2011 the Year of the African Descendant.  </p>

		<p>1-&#8220;&hellip;that aims to &ldquo;right historical wrongs.&#8221;: The historical wrong is that Africans are in the Americas in the first place. The only way to make this right is to repatriate all African descendants to Africa, otherwise, the grievance committee will live forever.<br>
2-&#8220;&hellip;for recognizing the strength and resilience of Afro-descendant communities throughout the Americas, who have thrived despite historical discrimination and repression.&#8221;: If they are strong, resilient, and have thrived, then what&rsquo;s the problem? Other races have all suffered discrimination at one time or another through history.<br>
3-&#8220;&hellip;their mothers face more risks in childbirth, adult men have higher rates of homicide and HIV, and adolescents are more likely to become pregnant.&#8221;: Why is this a problem Whites have to solve? Are they saying Blacks are incapable of solving these issues on their own?<br>
4-&#8220;This year is a time to celebrate the power of Afro-descendant organizations&hellip;&#8221;: Again, if they are so powerful, why do they need support from everyone else? Whose idea was this anyway?<br>
5-&#8220;One of the Americas&rsquo; pending debts&hellip;&#8221;: Fine, I will pay to send multiple Blacks back to Africa with the stipulation that they are not allowed to return.</p>

<p>If we do not GET OUT of the UN, we are nothing but stupid fools! THIS is what the Republicans should be addressing!</p>
<p>We all know what this means, don&rsquo;t we? ALL Whites will be denied any services, but WE will pay for the &#8220;Africans&#8221; demands/services and we KNOW what that means!</p>
<p><br>
Talk about discrimination and oppression! It is ALL against Whites throughout the world and we know it! Let us do something to stop this EVIL before it is too late. I mean NOW!  Demand the media and our government address what this really means.</p>

		<p>Given that 95%, yes - 95% - of all kidnapped Africans were brought to the Spanish and Portugues colonies and all around the Carribean (Spanish, French, Dutch, English) - and that only about 450,000 (about 5%) of the rest were shipped to the 13 colonies and later United States, it would seem to me that LATINO nations, especially, should be held to account and have to put up 95% of the money this shakedown exercise will require.</p>

		<p>This is all headed in the direction of &#8220;reparations,&#8221; right?</p>
<p>Can you imagine what a can of worms a &#8220;reparations&#8221; program would open up?  &mdash;  </p>
<p>1. Would the amount of reparations be based upon the darkness of skin? That is, would extremely dark blacks be entitled to a greater amount of reparations than mulattoes?</p>
<p>2. Would only white Americans have to pay the tax? After all, it would be unfair to tax Asians and Hispanics, whose ancestors  were not involved in the slave trade, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a generation to be 25 years. Under Jewish law, &#8220;the sins of the father are visited unto the FOURTH generation.&#8221; Even if black slavery could be considered sinful (and not simply business as usual, which it was), SIX generations have passed since slavery. Sorry, but the SIXTH generation cannot be help responsible for the sins of their ancestors.</p>
<p>I WOULD be in favor of paying reparations to any American black who wanted to return to Africa, renounce their American citizenship, and start a new life there. Because of its great store of wealth, Africa will be the land of opportunity during the coming century. Horace Greeley would tell blacks,</p>
<p>&#8220;Go East, young black man!:</p>

<p>Since you don&rsquo;t explain the &#8220;why&#8221; of this, I will.</p>
<p>When the Turks invaded and subjugated Serbia and the other regions of what became known as the Balkans (Turkish for &#8220;hills&#8221;)in the 14th century, they began a campaign of systematic rape of Serbian and other Balkan women.  Their children were raised as Muslims and given local authority over the remaining majority Christian Serbs.  These were the ones that came to be known as Bosnians today.  Some populations, such as the Albanians, sold out wholesale for better treatment.  The Serbs always resisted.  It was the Serbs who finally fought and defeated the Turks in 1878.  The Serbs thought that being Christians, The Hapsburg Austrian Empire rulers would support them.  To their shock, the Hapsburgs made a deal with the Turks and sent in troops to violently suppress the Serbs in Bosnia/Herzegovina.  So it was a Bosnian Serb (Gravilo Princip)a member of the secret society &#8220;The Black Hand&#8221;(subversive group against Hapsburg rule), who assassinated Archduke Ferdinand and began WW1.</p>
<p>That is more explanation than required, but the point is that the Serbs have been abused and humiliated for centuries by the Turks and the Muslim Bosnians.  If we use the same logic as is used by this woman and the usual repairations rhetoric, then all modern Serbian war criminals ought to be found innocent of charges based on centuries old abuses that far outweigh in world consequence, the black slave trade in the New World. Even the most thuggish of all of the Serb paramilitary raiders, &#8220;Arkan,&#8221; is justified by this logic.</p>
<p>I lived in this area in the late 1990s and learned a great deal.  One thing that came out later, after 9/11, was that there was an al Queda headquarters in Sarajevo in the early 1990s, working in forming a terrorist headquarters in Europe.  Had these Bosnian Serbs and Milosevic not done what they had, Europe may well have already seen more and larger attacks such as NYC on 9/11.  We now know of plots to blow up the Eiffel Tower for example.  The deal that NATO made with Serbia (as Yugoslavia) in 1999, was that for a withdrawal of troops from Kosovo, they would guarantee that they would not allow a Albanian, Muslim state to be established there.  Two years ago, the UN recognized Kosovo as an independent, Muslim nation.  Meanwhile, the Albanians burned down every centuries old Serbian Orthodox church in Kosovo.  </p>
<p>Go to this link for a very beautiful and heartbreaking film and singing by a Serbian folk star concerning the destruction of these churches and the culture/history/people they represent.</p>
