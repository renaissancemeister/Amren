<h1>Feinstein Uses Private Bills to Block Deportations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Doyle, Sacramento Bee, May 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nayely Arreola was a high school junior when a U.S. senator first protected her from deportation. The year: 2003.</p>
<p>Nayely is now 25, newly married and a graduate of Fresno Pacific University. She and her family still remain protected, thanks to special bills that need not pass to exert influence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As she has regularly since 2003, [Sen. Dianne] Feinstein in March re-introduced a so-called private bill on behalf of the Arreola family. It effectively blocks deportation, even without final approval from Congress.</p>
<p>Private bills, controversial in some circles, have become a part of Feinstein&rsquo;s arsenal.</p>
<p>Feinstein this year has introduced 13 private bills to block deportations, more than any other member of Congress. Her private bills account for one-fifth of the 64 introduced in the entire House and Senate, records show.</p>
<p>Each bill would grant specific individuals legal U.S. residency. To balance the immigration books, each bill correspondingly reduces the number of visas available to others. All told, Feinstein&rsquo;s 13 bills would grant 28 illegal immigrants U.S. residency.</p>
<p>Once introduced, the bills essentially freeze immigration enforcement actions. Consequently, the private bills reintroduced every Congress amount to permanent ad hoc solutions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even under the private bill shield, though, Nayely acknowledged anxiety. Every year, her family is reinvestigated. The future brings uncertainty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not knowing what happens if Senator Feinstein is no longer in office,&#8221; Nayely said, describing her big looming concern.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics call the private bills a bad habit. In the past, some private bills in particular have given lawmakers a black eye.</p>
<p>Last year, reflecting in part the congressional discomfort, only two private bills were signed into law. One was Feinstein&rsquo;s. In 2009, no private bill became law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Private immigration bills were once common, with hundreds passing annually. The Congressional Research Service noted private bills began to decline after the 1970s following &#8220;a series of corruption scandals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. involving payoffs for the sponsorship of private immigration laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she introduces them, Feinstein casts the private bills as justice for families filled with high achievers and hard workers.</p>

<p>She need not worry.  California voters will keep her in office until she dies, and when she does, they&rsquo;ll put another leftist Democrat, and maybe a Hispanic one if the demographics are &#8220;right&#8221; enough, to replace her.</p>

		<p>Is this so shocking to people?</p>
<p>Democracy and the rule of law are carefully crafted fantasies designed to keep you ignorant, powerless and most of all, quiet about how things really work in our government at all levels.</p>
<p>And that involves envelopes stuffed with money.  Someone, somewhere, probably a drug cartel, gave each member of Congress what amounts to a bribe to let these people in.  That&rsquo;s what Congresspeople DO all day long&hellip;.collect envelopes full of money.  We really need to invent a new word for this form of government&hellip;..where only those who paid for their vote actually have that vote count.  It IS a form of democracy, I guess.  It might even be a version of the democracy our founding fathers planned (remember, in the beginning, only rich, land owning white men could vote).</p>
<p>Of course, our founding fathers specifically kept taxes out of the equation and resisted a central bank.  Both of which are essentially bribe machines that run off of OUR money.  They steal our money to bribe politicians to vote the way they want.  A form of taxation without representation.</p>
<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

		<p>Dear Sen. Feinstein,</p>
<p>I have a dream.  I&rsquo;m seeking a better life for myself (primarily I want to obtain a higher standard of living), and will very shortly undertake some illegal activities at a local bank or quickie-mart which will provide me a much better life.  Excuse me, did I say ILLEGAL ACTIVITY?  What I meant was I will perform an undocumented withdraw.  Before I undertake that activity, I want to make sure that you will push a bill through the legislature to decriminalize my activity.  You may go ahead and compensate for this by punishing some other person who has not committed an illegal act. It doesn&rsquo;t mater who   &mdash;   just someone else, who is NOT in your voting district, and who played by the rules.  Thanks. I greatly appreciate your lack of corruption; it is an inspiration to all of us taxpayers.</p>

		<p>All you need to know about D. Feinstein.</p>
<p>1. In 1992, she was fined $190,000 for failure to properly report campaign contributions and expenditures associated with that campaign.</p>
<p>2. By 2005 her net worth had increased to between $43 million and $99 million.</p>
<p>3. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) chairs the Senate Rules Committee, but she&rsquo;s also a Cardinal. She is currently chairwoman of the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies subcommittee, but until last year was for six years the top Democrat on the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (or &ldquo;Milcon&rdquo;) sub-committee, where she may have directed more than $1 billion to companies controlled by her husband.</p>
<p>4. Senator Feinstein is a staunch gun control advocate. Despite her stance, in the 1970s, she obtained a concealed firearms carry permit, and carried a handgun with her. A CCW permit was then rare in California.</p>
<p>5. California-based media performance coach Terry Anzur, who took part in moderating a debate in 1990 between Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein – then a mayor – as she ran for governor against former Republican Governor Pete Wilson. Anzur recounted not only that Feinstein had several words written on her hands to remind herself of her three basic campaign themes – growth, abortion and education – but, unlike Sarah Palin&rsquo;s recent public appearance, Feinstein was breaking debate rules by having the notes on her hand. Anzur informed viewers that after Feinstein was confronted about the writing on her hand after the debate that she refused to allow panel members to examine her hand and left abruptly. Anzur: &#8220;So after the debate, we went up to Dianne Feinstein and we said, &lsquo;Can we see your hand?&rsquo; She puts her hand behind her back and says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to show you,&rsquo; and walked out of the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>6. Quick quiz for you. The number one enemy of solar and wind energy projects in the Mojave desert is a) Big Business b) Dick Cheney c) a Republican &#8220;cabal&#8221; d) environmentalists, with the political backing of  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).<br>
Of course, the answer is d).</p>
<p>She is a self-serving liberal who has done nothing good for this state for WAY too many years.</p>

<p>U.S. citizenship is a priceless commodity.  When the government gives it away a million times a year, it is stealing from its citizens.</p>
<p>Feinstein is a petty thief compared to the government&rsquo;s legal immigration crime.</p>

		<p>Thanks to all you traitors for not preserving a White America.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t leave America, America left me.</p>
<p>So where in the world can we immigrate to? There is no place left and the enemy made sure of that.</p>
<p>BTW, I just caught a glimpse of who Oprah is going to have on her show tomorrow? (I think)&hellip;25 years ago she had 2 skinheads on who called blacks monkeys and that they hate blacks and NOW they are back talking about where they are now and how they feel&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we all know what they will say right? How wrong they were and how the skinheads are a bunch of racist, evil haters etc.etc.  </p>
<p>Now why doesn&rsquo;t Oprah put on her show that black professor who called for Whites to be killed off the planet? Why doesn&rsquo;t she put on all those blacks that beat, rape and kill White people? Why doesn&rsquo;t she put on the New Black Panthers? How about the black murderers of Newsome/Christian and interview the black Carr brothers who raped and murdered those young Whites in Wichita, and the list goes on. We all KNOW why she doesn&rsquo;t, she just thrives putting on White racists and Whites who have all sorts of dysfunctional problems. </p>

		<p>I have never voted for Feinstein  .I remember way back before prop 187 passed in California, she was being asked if she was for it or against it, she hesitated for a long time, and then came out against it.  I think she really wanted it to pass, but she is beholden to moolah interests, not those of ordinary Californian whites and those who wish to abide by our laws. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in California my whole life. Diane Feinstein is, hands down, the most corrupt politician in the state. She could easily be prosecuted for several things, but the hundreds of  improprieties alone that she has been allowed to get away with, proves that democrats care as little about morality as they accuse Republicans of. Some of the decisions she has made could only be excused by either senility or criminality. There is no other reason why she&rsquo;s voted against the citizens best interests, over and over again.</p>

<p>I agree with you, but I think there&rsquo;s something else at work, too - blackmail. Show me one person who doesn&rsquo;t have a skeleton in the closet somewhere. I think if a congressman wants to stay honest, the ones pulling the strings dig up some dirt on him so he&rsquo;ll get with the program.  </p>

<p>GB is nothing but another phony talking head. I cannot stand to even hear his voice, let alone those sidekicks,(Stu) he has on his radio show. Beck promotes the &#8220;Black Founding Fathers&#8221;, promotes MLK and his &#8220;dream&#8221;, promotes anything but White American interests. He also slurs anyone thought to be a &#8220;nazi&#8221; White Supremacist, and anyone who puts their &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; above all others. </p>
<p>He would NEVER read this site or interview Jared Taylor and if he did he would call all of us a bunch of haters, bigots, racists, and anti-Americans, as most neocon radio/TV show hosts would do. Remember that ALL of them only want illegals to &#8220;do it the right way and become legal&#8221;!  Follow the law, they say&hellip; They would never favor deportation whatsoever. People like GB and the rest are not on OUR side, just the opposite.</p>

<p>My fine friend, you can have whatever you can keep. But if you cannot keep this country, how in heaven do you believe you will keep a place where you are a stranger? There is no place to run and no place to hide. You cannot avoid the choice of protecting your country from invaders and still expect to have a country. If you cannot keep your country, it will soon become someone else&rsquo;s country and you will have no country. About this, I am absolutely certain.<br>

<p>I understand that.. I meant in the  &#8220;so where can we immigrate to&#8221; as  meaning there is NO place for Whites to immigrate to. ALL of our White nations are in the same boat as we are. Their nations are flooded with Africans and other 3rd world peoples. </p>
<p>How are we going to protect our countries for our own people when the laws and our governments/media are totally against us? They will imprison us or we will have an &#8220;accident&#8221;, slandered in the press, lose our jobs, etc. etc. You know the drill. most Whites are in denial, naive, scared, or just plain stupid and will never get in board with those of us who know what the agenda really is. Look at most WN sites and how they are demonized daily in the press and by the alphabet orgs. They have few members. All we do is talk, we do not march and protest, we do not voice our concerns on talk shows because we will be cut off and slandered by the hosts, we do not call the media on their constant attacks on us, as &#8220;nazis, lil Hitler&rsquo;s, K&rsquo;ers, etc. anytime we defend our own race and racial interests.</p>
<p> So, I do not know the answer or how to even go about keeping and taking our nations back.  </p>

The husband is a brilliant aerospace engineering professor, the wife a registered nurse and their sons excellent students. Why, why, why on God&rsquo;s green earth are we shunning productive, well educated people like this family? </p>

<p>Great post, but one item I would like to shed some more light upon;</p>
<p>The reason that many environmentalists are coming out against solar and wind projects is that fact that it has been federally mandated that these systems be supported by coal burning plants that would kick-in when the wind died down, or the sun was obscured.  The argument has been that wind and solar are inconsistent and cannot be relied upon as a continuous power source.  This represents a huge boon to the coal and nuclear energy (as well as natural gas) industries.  Meanwhile, it turns out that natural gas extraction releases huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care?  Okay, but the day is coming when you will.</p>

		<p>This is so incredibly unfair! I am white, I live in Québec, and I have plans to apply to an American university, to get a master&rsquo;s degree in your country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to fill out a whole lot of forms, and pay very expensive tuition fees, while those Mestizo Mexican and South American illegal immigrants who get into the U.S. illegally, work without ever paying a dollar in taxes. And somehow, they are given American scholarships so they can study in one of your universities, without paying a cent in tuition fees. And of course, they&rsquo;ll study there, after they have gotten admitted in the program of their choice, getting ahead of better qualified Whites (and despite the fact most speak very poor English -if they do speak the language!), thanks to affirmative action.</p>
<p>And this kind of thing is possible, with the blessing of an American senator, who herself, is paid by your very own tax dollars&hellip; Excuse me, I think I am going to throw up!</p>

		<p>Dear  François from Post # 20.  Don&rsquo;t forget that after the illegal immigrant receives his/her education at greatly reduced cost, they will be courted by thousands of companies and governmental agencies for high-paying jobs, simply because of their skin color (to fill affirmative action quotas).  You will NOT have that advantage.  Why?  because 1) you are not illegal, and 2) you do not have the politically correct skin color.</p>

Feinstein quits committee <br>
under war-profiteer cloud<br>

<p>Report documents military contracts <br>
for firms owned by senator&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has abruptly walked away from her <br>
responsibilities with the Senate Military Construction Appropriations <br>
Subcommittee after a report linked her votes to the financial well-being of her husband&rsquo;s companies, which received BILLIONS OF DOLLARS worth of military construction contracts she approved.<br>

<p>HERE WE ARE LITTLE MORE THAN TWO YEARS LATER&hellip; Jeez! Is her husband just a jack-of-all-trades, astute businessman (major defense contractor THEN; NOW feeding off of the bankster-engineered subprime mortgage fiasco destroying the remaining assets of the beleaguered middle class) or an OPPORTUNISTIC PREDATOR <br>
EXTRAORDINAIRE LIKE HIS WIFE?</p>

EXCLUSIVE: Senator&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s firm cashes in on crisis</p>
<p>On the day the new Congress convened this year, Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation to route $25 BILLION IN TAXPAYER MONEY to a government agency that had just awarded her husband&rsquo;s real estate firm a lucrative contract to sell foreclosed properties at compensation rates higher than the industry norms.</p>
<p>Mrs. Feinstein&rsquo;s intervention on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was unusual: the California Democrat isn&rsquo;t a member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs with jurisdiction over FDIC; and the agency is supposed to operate from money it raises from bank-paid insurance payments - not direct federal dollars.</p>

<p>Maybe I should change my name from François, to Francisco Joselito Domenico de San Andrea, get a sun tan, and then try to enter the U.S. illegally, then. That might just work, who knows?</p>
