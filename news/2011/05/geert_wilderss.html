<h1>Geert Wilders&rsquo;s Message to Americans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Randall, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> May 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The winding lines outside the church reminded me of the TSA; once inside, the metal detectors and pat-downs had me wondering if I&rsquo;d taken a wrong turn and wound up at the airport. It&rsquo;s not every day that security is required at church, but it&rsquo;s also not every day that a prominent and controversial nationalist politician crosses the Atlantic to speak before a throng of American supporters.</p>
<p>Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders did just that this past Thursday at the Cornerstone Church in Nashville. There he delivered an ominously titled speech, &#8220;A Warning to America,&#8221; to a lily-white audience that must have exceeded one thousand; there were only a few dozen empty seats in this sprawling megachurch.</p>
<p>The event was organized by the newly formed Tennessee Freedom Coalition (TFC) a Tea Party-style, grassroots organization with broadly conservative goals. The group is not explicitly racial, though according to the <a href="https://www.tnfreedomcoalition.org/issues.html">issues page</a> on its website, it does seek to &#8220;promote cultural cohesion by opposing illegal immigration,&#8221; which is a first step towards opposing non-Western immigration.</p>
<p>The TFC&rsquo;s marketing efforts, which included radio ads and social media outreach, helped draw a huge crowd to see a European politician most Americans have never heard of. Another supporter of the event was the well-organized anti-Islam movement in the Nashville area which has made national headlines for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-oe-mcmanus-mosques-20110519,0,7586153.column?track=rss">opposing</a> the construction of a mosque in nearby Murfreesboro and for introducing anti-Sharia legislation at the state level.</p>
<p>While the turnout was encouraging, the speech itself was uneven (you can read the full text <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/printpage/?url=https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2011/05/a_warning_to_america_geert_wil.html">here</a>). Most <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">American Renaissance </i>readers are familiar with Mr. Wilders&rsquo;s staunch opposition to Islam combined with indifference to the question of race. This speech was no different, with Mr. Wilders regularly railing against Islam as a &#8220;totalitarian ideology of hate and violence,&#8221; but never mentioning race.</p>
<p>At times, the speech seemed inappropriate for an American audience. For instance, Mr. Wilders said that &#8220;leaders who talk about immigration without mentioning Islam are blind. They ignore the most important problem Europe and America are facing. I have a message for them: It&rsquo;s Islam, stupid!&#8221; While this may be a politically savvy approach for a conservative politician in Europe, in America, our immigration problems are not Islamization nearly so much as they are Hispanicization. Anyone who thinks Islam is &#8220;the most important problem&#8221; America faces is out of touch.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Wilders atoned for these timid remarks by calling for an outright end to immigration from non-Western countries to all of &#8220;our [Western] countries.&#8221; He boasted of how his party, through its role in a coalition government, has pushed through a restriction of immigration &#8220;from non-Western countries by up to 50 percent in the next four years.&#8221; He encouraged Americans to make similar efforts and &#8220;stop immigration from non-Western countries, which are mostly Islamic countries.&#8221; Though this last assertion is wrong, the proposal received a roaring ovation.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilders also took strong jabs at multiculturalism, declaring it a &#8220;disaster,&#8221; and decrying the &#8220;devastating results of multicultural society.&#8221; He called for an end to cultural relativism, admonishing the audience to &#8220;repeat it over and over again, especially to our children: Our Western culture based on Christianity and Judaism is superior to Islamic culture.&#8221; This, too, received a standing ovation.</p>
<p>On the whole, the audience embraced Mr. Wilders&rsquo;s message, even at its most inflammatory. He referred to mosques as &#8220;hate palaces,&#8221; described his fight as one against &#8220;Islamic barbarism,&#8221; and proposed shutting down all Islamic schools &#8220;because educating children in a spirit of hate is one of the worst things imaginable,&#8221; all with the tacit and even explicit approval of the audience.</p>
<p>The only dissenter was a wimpy-looking leftist who softly cried, &#8220;Jesus told us to love everyone,&#8221; before scurrying out of the sanctuary. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Wilders replied by saying, &#8220;I have no problem with Muslims, but I do have a problem with the totalitarian Islamic ideology of hate and violence.&#8221; Moderating lines like this peppered his speech and detracted from his otherwise hard-hitting presentation.</p>
<p>Some race realists wonder whether Mr. Wilders actually understands race and criticizes Islam as a politically expedient proxy for non-whites. Clearly, many of his grievances against Islam are legitimate, though he sometimes overstates the case for rhetorical purposes. What is undeniable is the success of this approach in the Netherlands, where his Party for Freedom is currently the third-largest and an indispensable part of the coalition.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilders has risen to prominence as the foremost European critic of Muslim immigration, largely because of his ongoing &#8220;hate speech&#8221; trial in the Netherlands and his tendency to criticize Islam from a left-wing perspective. He usually hammers away at Islam&rsquo;s oppression of women and homosexuals, though these elements were surprisingly absent from his speech at Cornerstone.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilders&rsquo;s approach is very effective in Europe, and though his message was well received by conservative Christians, it is not right for the United States. The practices of Muslims and Muslim immigration are a relatively minor problem for us. He is, of course, a politician, but I was disappointed by the narrow focus of his speech.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was impressive to have gathered more than 1,000 Americans for a non-partisan political speech on a Thursday evening. Nor was I the only one to notice just how <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/dutch-anti-islam-zealot-geert-wilders-finds-a-sympathetic-ear-at-madisons-cornerstone-church/Content?oid=2450397">white</a> the crowd was. Any time white Americans start thinking in terms of their own interests, and distinguish themselves from other groups, it is an important step toward racial consciousness. For that, and for his political breakthrough in the Netherlands, we can be thankful to Geert Wilders.</p>

		<p>Excellent. Wilders is a stepping stone to the ultimate goal, he isn&rsquo;t the goal itself bc Islam is just part of the problem. Hopefully he&rsquo;s more than a bogeyman to scare W.European Muslims into cohesion like 911 did, eg: Wilders is a staunch Eurocrat and differs a lot from Le Pen in terms of relations with the EU &amp; Russia. Time will tell.</p>

		<p>Yes we must take what we can get. When we demand the truth and we demand courage we will get it. The shame is that there are no nationalist American candidates on the national level.  So we have to send to Holland to get one. And this in the nation that has Teddy Roosevelt up on Mt. Rushmore. Bill Clinton isnt on Mt. Rushmore and never will be, because deep down the American spirit has never changed. But we have no politicians who know how to tell the simple truth let alone reach out and lift up a demoralized people or defend the race that built the country from scratch. We will either find expression of what we feel and believe inside the political system or we things will come to a violent explosion. But more silence, and more lies and more avoidance will not work, but only build up the pressure.</p>

		<p>Wilders is doing nothing more than promoting the same old conservative lies.  Those lies go something like this.  Race doesn&rsquo;t exist in reality.  It&rsquo;s a social construct.  But since so many have been indoctrinated as part of that social construct into bad thinking, care must be used when co-habitating with them.  A police state is necessary to control all members until such a time that everyone becomes like white people through exposure to us.  Since it is racist to discriminate, whites must put up with it too, despite being a zero problem population.  And, oh, by the way, institutionalized racism opens the door for that bad behavior and is a big part of the problem.  Whites must be brutalized, errrm indoctrinated, errr, gently taught they are at fault by loss of income, position, and freedom for wrong thinking.  Miscegenation is desired.  If we don&rsquo;t get enough of it, whites will be blamed and then forced.</p>
<p>Invisible enemies that you certainly can&rsquo;t identify easily by race, such as Muslims or more nebulously &#8220;radical&#8221; Muslims, are the problem.  Nothing concrete can be done about this so I will make speeches with lots of hate rhetoric against anyone who suggests the truth or any real, effective solutions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all bull.  And the problems in all of Europe are easily solved by a willingness to embrace race as the problem and discrimination based on race as the solution.</p>
<p>Blacks and Arabs are the problem.  But 99% of them can&rsquo;t survive in Europe without welfare.  Easy solution.  Pass laws that absolutely forbid welfare of any form going to blacks or Arabs based on genetic testing.  You push your thumb on a scanner, a few weeks later you get a designation.  If you are the wrong race, no welfare for you, no exceptions.</p>
<p>Within weeks.  No&hellip;within DAYS, all problems would evaporate.</p>

		<p>For Europe there is no immigration issue (to speak of) only Islam. Wilders is right to focus on Islam, though for America it&rsquo;s a little off the mark. Race is not a big issue for Europeans, we don&rsquo;t have America&rsquo;s problems with blacks and hispanics, but we have a serious cultural transformation, and it&rsquo;s not possible to escape by moving out to the country side. Our culture is changing before our very eyes. It seems to me that the problems in America are mostly the criminals from the low-IQ groups, but here schoolgirls dye their hair black, stop eating pork, at least in school, and think anything native is oppressive and wrong.</p>
<p>Yes the low-IQ immigrants/blacks that you have are more criminal and on welfare than native whites, but they don&rsquo;t have the conqueror mindset that the Islamists have. I think only La Raza comes close, but Islam is a much more tightly knit network, and they are unified across races and countries against us. Their numbers are staggering, and even if only a &#8220;small&#8221; beachhead of 20 million have reached us, they have not yet been met with any serious opposition. I do think the coming years will bring a sea change though, hopefully within an election cycle. Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s book in Germany last year really changed the political debate all across the continent, hopefully something will come out of it.</p>

		<p>Mr. Wilders&rsquo;s approach is not for the United States? I hope the author rethinks this statement. The more Muslims we allow in will only hasten the same poison that has infected Europe. This man is trying to warn us. Does the author want to wait until the Jihadists are gathering in the streets and yelling their threats to the infidels?  Let&rsquo;s take note right now - don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late, like we&rsquo;ve done with the invaders from south of the border.</p>

		<p>&#8221; Anyone who thinks Islam is &ldquo;the most important problem&rdquo; America faces is out of touch&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Randall, I suggest that YOU may be the one out of touch here.  Islam IS the greater problem the American/Western way of life faces now and in the future. Illegal aliens from South of the border are a problem only in that they parasiticize our social resources, SSI and others which they have never paid into, e.g. a FINANCIAL problem. Islam, on the other hand, intends to convert, enslave or murder all of us non muslims (seen that up close and personal) sharia is a tremendous threat to free Western women. PLEASE! learn more about islam, or come over here and see what we see here in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait or Saudi&hellip;You are blind Mr. Randall and you must see before you choose the wrong side.</p>

		<p>To reverse a pendulum, it may take many tiny whacks instead of one giant one. People don&rsquo;t like sudden radical change.</p>
<p>Wilders, like Jared Taylor here in the United States, is reminding people that what makes their countries what they are is not the laws, food or corporations. It&rsquo;s the people. Biology trumps politics.</p>
<p>For many years, we&rsquo;ve been thinking in Cold War terms   &mdash;   equal capitalists versus equal communists. Now we&rsquo;re seeing that the equality part was the wrong part, and that groups and individuals are different.</p>
<p>We need to find people like those who built our nations to keep our nations the way they are, and if we introduce internal conflict like immigration, we destroy them.</p>
<p>Wilders may not be as articulate or far-thinking on this issue as Mr. Taylor is, but he&rsquo;s a great start. I really enjoyed this articulate and rational report from Mr. Randall.</p>

Though the U.S. certainly has more blacks and thus more black crime, I&rsquo;ve read a lot in the last two years or so that indicates crimes in Europe such are rape are surging in which many of the culprits are Afro-Caribbeans or black Africans.  Is the invasion of Moslems (who in many instances also rape) a much bigger problem than black crime?  </p>

		<p>The Middle Tennessee Tea Party includes plenty of African-Americans. Ain&rsquo;t it wonderful how blacks and whites can come together in agreement that Muslims are totally despicable? This whole Muslim thing is a big distraction, and I&rsquo;m dismayed that so many otherwise intelligent people at AmRen are getting sucked into it.</p>

		<p>June (#6) is absolutely right.  Islam is not America&rsquo;s number one problem - at the moment.  But that could change, as it is still an increasing threat to our culture.  We need to learn from the lessons Mr. Wilder teaches about Europe&rsquo;s woes, and learn as well from the issues we face from Hispanic immigration&hellip; and apply those lessons to current and future challenges.  Mr. Wilders speech may not have been perfectly geared toward our current situation, but we need to take the themes to heart.<br>

<p>Excellent point! I didn&rsquo;t much care for your casual dismissal of race as something important, but the final point you  made above is worth noting.</p>
<p>Oddly, this  (the Islamic menace) is nothing new to Europe. It has been a threat looming over Europe for well over a thousand years.  Charlemagne was fighting it! It has cost us  many wars and countless lives.  And the fight goes on today (even if our leaders don&rsquo;t know it). At the moment, Islam is enegaged in fighting us, but we are not fighting back. </p>
<p>Given Islam&rsquo;s history of aggression against the West (and against ALL other cultures/peoples/religions),  this naivety on our part is inexcusable. We have been through too much to be so gullible and  foolish. We should not have to need any warnings.</p>

I was about to disagree with you- and say, in effect, that Wilders&rsquo; rejection of race as an issue was none the less a step in the right direction- because he slams Islam down HARD, as it is so totally culpable, full of hatred and violence toward Europe and the USA.<br>
But then I thought&hellip;if Islam were (somehow) a 100% WHITE-populated religion, would it be such a blithe on humanity?<br>
No, of course it wouldn&rsquo;t.  But then again, it was Arabs- AKA- the racial angle- that created Islam, anyway. It&rsquo;s THEIR customs of beating and brutalizing women, executing accused homosexuals, and getting off on cutting heads of &#8220;infidels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, your point rings true.<br>
But Wilders IS a step in the right direction. Just watch his film. We need more of that!</p>

<p>Well, Northwest, you&rsquo;re certainly right, in that you have a tremendous problem because of Islam&rsquo;s ORGANIZED hatred and violence against white society.</p>
<p>But the USA has had a ferocious problem with black on white violence, especially murder, since the maturation of the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement in the mid 1960s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a war that&rsquo;s claimed a LOT more whites than Viet Nam. And it&rsquo;s lasted four times longer, and no end in sight. A &#8220;low - level&#8221; war that periodically- predictably- explodes into a high level war&hellip;that is, until the blacks have burned, rioted and raped their way through all that surrounds them, and they get hungry and thirsty and tired. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joking. This is a constant low- level war with yearly large battles, some immense. We&rsquo;ve had scores of large black riots, and they start over nothing at all. <br>
And the black gangs- now joined by the most malevolent Latin American gangs.</p>
<p>These low level thugs may not be smart enough to pull their pants up, but they do kill a lot of whites, and permanently blight our cities.</p>
<p>Habib just has more resolve, and maybe five or ten more IQ points, but  Ja Quann and Hector are deadly. And in Hector&rsquo;s case, well, his rapacious Mestizo horde are here by the tens of millions, breeding like - Mestizos.  There&rsquo;s no undoing what they have wrought.</p>

		<p>It is true that Wilders is talking about the European situation. </p>
<p>But it is absolutely wrong to downplay the enormous threat of Islamization in the United States. </p>
<p>Worse yet, imagine the United States facing the Islamic world once Europe has been fully conquered by Islam!!</p>
<p>A nightmare scenario&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The 10 most important issues facing Europe today are:</p>
<p>Islamization, <br>
Islamization, <br>
Islamization, <br>

Islamization, <br>
and Islamization!!!!!!</p>
<p>No other issue comes remotely close in importance - and certainly not the issue of race per se (aside from Muslims, Third World immigration to Europe is a nuisance, not an existential threat).</p>
<p>Islam is a totalitarian political movement which seeks to destroy European society and replace it with something radically alien.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they are succeeding ONLY because Europe has been passive and self-destructive. </p>
<p>Once Europe changes its mind and decides NOT to commit suicide (and the trends look positive at the moment), then we will be able to face the challenge of Islam.</p>
<p>But it had better happen soon, is another 10 years, and it will be OVER.</p>
<p>There is absolutely NO possibility whatsoever of Europe surviving in any form UNLESS Muslim immigration is reduced or eliminated (and ideally reversed), and the Muslim birthrate is drastically reduced by slashing social welfare programs, which are essentially a gigantic transfer of wealth from Europe to Islam.</p>
<p>When Europeans have no children or 1 child so they can afford to pay taxes which go to Muslim invaders with 7-8 children, they are not only cooperating with their own genocide, but footing the bill as well.</p>
<p>Please remember where you come from – Europe! <br>

<p>You obviously don&rsquo;t have any understanding of what&rsquo;s going on in America.  Europe&rsquo;s nonwhite population averages about 8 percent while America&rsquo;s is about 40 percent.  Blacks are still a novelty in Europe but that will change as their populations continue to grow.  It&rsquo;s not just the crime wave either.  White taxpayers are paying for the vast majority of black births in this country and they are single-handedly holding up the black poor, middle and upper classes either with some kind of government assistance or with &#8220;make work&#8221; government jobs, affirmative action, quotas, preferential hiring, contract preferences, etc. More than half the immigrants coming into this country are on welfare.  Corporations are playing economic warfare with White Americans by hiring aliens who&rsquo;ll work at a lower wage and it&rsquo;s not just the poor either.  Computer programmers, doctors, attorneys, technicians, just about every job can be up for grabs to the lowest bidder.  This is forcing many disgruntled Americans to embrace socialism/communism and they team up with the nonwhite hordes to exact revenge on them.  Our form of government is being transformed before our very eyes and our culture is almost completely obliterated.  We may not even survive intact as a nation. If Europe knows what good for them they&rsquo;d better change direction and go nationalist against their governments while the immigrant population is still small enough to deport.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;Our Western culture based on Christianity and Judaism is superior to Islamic culture.&rdquo; This, too, received a standing ovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>A standing ovation?  Do any of the people in this audience have the ability to read and do even a mediocre level of historical research?   Let&rsquo;s set the record straight, okay?</p>
<p>[begin quote]<br>
Drew L. Smith&rsquo;s &#8220;History of America,&#8221;<br>
States Founders Were of Same Race</p>
<p>Drew L. Smith wrote the following on page 78 of his<br>
book:</p>
<p>In the study of American history, it is a remarkable and significant fact - being the racial cohesiveness and the superior creative qualities that characterized the<br>
governing class in America at that time.  Not only were all these leaders of the white race, but almost all of them could either trace their ancestry to some part of the British Isles or wre born there themselves - in England, Scotland, Ireland or<br>
Wales.</p>
<p>Indeed, the racial composition of the American people as a whole throughout the United States was overwhelmingly of the same background as their leaders.  This may be seen from the following study made by the United States Census Bureau,<br>
entitled, &#8220;A Century of Populaiton Growth&#8221;.  It classifies our population in 1790 as<br>
follows:</p>
<p>Total white			3, 172, 444</p>
<p>English				2, 605, 699	82.1%<br>
Scotch				    221, 562	 7.0 <br>
Irish				      61, 534	 1.9<br>
Dutch				      78, 959	 2.5<br>
French				     17, 619      .6<br>
German				    176, 407     5.6<br>
Hebrew				       1, 243	  &hellip;<br>
All other			       9, 421      .3</p>
<p><br>
These were the closely kindred peoples responsible for constructing the foundation upon which this nation rests.  It clearly refutes the liberal contention that this country<br>
was formed out of a mass of heterogeneous immigrants.<br>
[end quote]</p>
<p>Now, perhaps Steven Randall, and those poorly read folks who gave Wilders that &#8216;standing ovation&rsquo; would like to explain to me, and to all the other AR readers, how a group of people who totalled only 1, 243 on the 1790 official census - can have the gall to lay claim to sharing credit for the creation of White Western culture?</p>
<p>Out of a total population of 3,172,444 - we are expected to believe that Western civilization (which has its roots in ancient Greece, by the way) could not have arisen and been successful had those 1,243  not been here?</p>

Our culture is changing before our very eyes. It seems to me that the problems in America are mostly the criminals from the low-IQ groups, but here schoolgirls dye their hair black, stop eating pork, at least in school, and think anything native is oppressive and wrong.</p>
<p>It is NOT just your &#8220;culture&#8221; that is changing. It is RACE replacement. The same in America and ALL White nations. We need to quit using terms such as &#8220;multicultural&#8221; and start using the REAL term, multiRACIAL! European Whites all have different &#8220;cultures&#8221; but they are all of the SAME race. The White race.</p>
<p>BTW, America suffers from not just the low IQ and nonwhite criminals, we suffer from NONwhites, period. They ALL have the same mindset. HATE WHITEY. </p>

		<p>As a European I can assure the author Mr Randall that Muslim immigration will - if unchecked - dwarf the problem of Latin Americans pouring over your southern border.</p>
<p>In Europe we have had some experience with Muslims by now.</p>
<p>Our societies are unarmed and heavily policed.</p>
<p>Muslims still manage to wreak havoc.</p>
<p>Apparently there is already a growing Muslim presence in the USA. Some of the newcomers are ethnic Arabs, other black Africans, mostly Somalis. If these populations ever reach critical mass, you may study the movie &#8220;Road Warrior&#8221; for practical survival tips.</p>
<p>If Muslim ever manage to reach 20% of the North American population, while having the right to purchase and own firearms, there will be hell to pay.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting Americans give up their guns. I am merely pointing out that you can either have the 2nd ammendment or you can have Muslims. You can&rsquo;t have both without day-to-day vilolence reaching wartime levels.</p>

The Hispanics are here to escape Mexican ineptitude, violence, and poverty.  Islamic immigrants are here to take this country over, by force if need be.  If that isn&rsquo;t the greatest danger to our country, I cannot imagine what is.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mr. Randall, I suggest that YOU may be the one out of touch here. Islam IS the greater problem the American/Western way of life faces now and in the future. Illegal aliens from South of the border are a problem only in that they parasiticize our social resources, SSI and others which they have never paid into, e.g. a FINANCIAL problem. Islam, on the other hand, intends to convert, enslave or murder all of us non muslims (seen that up close and personal) sharia is a tremendous threat to free Western women. PLEASE! learn more about islam, or come over here and see what we see here in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait or Saudi&hellip;You are blind Mr. Randall and you must see before you choose the wrong side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Have you ever been to the USA?  We have few Muslims and they are mostly well behaved middle class people.  Mexicans are far more than an economic problem.  They have a racially based hostility towards whites and want to take a large part of our country for their own.   I notice from your posts here that you have a monomaniacal obsession with Muslims.  You really make yourself sound foolish with statements like the above.  </p>
<p>To oldwhitelady:  Black Africans are a growing percentage of the nonwhites in Europe.  Many of them are at least theoretically Muslim(but may not practice orthodox Islam and may only have had ancestors who converted under duress from Arabs).  You notice that there are more blacks than Middle Eastern types in London and Paris now.  If you look at the populations and birth rates of the third world, it&rsquo;s likely that blacks immigration will be a bigger long term problem than Middle Eastern immigration(as these countries mostly have low birthrates now, while Africa&rsquo;s are still very high).  </p>

		<p>White girls dying their hair black? Evidently there is a racial aspect to Islam after all. To put it simply: most people know who their enemies are. Muslims may have nothing against Whites per se, but until conversion we are enemies and the light hair a Flag of our Camp and a red flag to the Islamic Bull. Likewise, the Weathermen had plans to kill millions of Whites. They have nothing against us per se, they just know that there is a relationship between Race and Culture. Weaken the Race and you can overthrow the Culture. Only Whites don&rsquo;t understand these things - and Conservative Whites are the most backwards of all.</p>

		<p> IS THIS THE REASON THE BORDERS  ARE NOT SECURE? NO MORE LIES?</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t think that the illegal immigrant occupation of America would have anything to do with any conspiracy theory? Do I believe in conspiracies? Never did, but something turned up that seems to have a lot of credence to it?  Each day Americans worry about feeding their families, paying mortgages or even the 15 million still seeking work? At the same time States adjoining Georgia or Alabama, less lenient States are angry that hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens may be heading their way? Same situation with Arizona as new policing laws could have countless numbers of illegal immigrant families will find a sanctuary in California and Nevada, with lax laws.   Specifically if you believe in the reams of classified information appearing from that very controversial website Wikileaks https://wikileaks.ch/cable/2005/01/05OTTAWA268.html</p>
<p>A covert document recently released by WikiLeaks discloses a elevated level  of information between the US and  Canadian Ambassador Paul Celluci promoting a merger of the United States, Canada, and Mexico as plans for &ldquo;North American Integration,&rdquo; also called &ldquo;North American Union.&rdquo; into pathway for a future North American &#8220;single market and a possible single currency.&#8221; For at least a decade investigators and whistle-blowers have attempted to warn the public relating to integration of the nations of Canada, Mexico and the United States of America and have been met with devastating mockery.  The Wikileaks document unmistakably indicates that the agenda is to avoid the US in protecting citizens from terrorists or diseases from interfering with trade and other economic interests.</p>
<p> This agenda would be united with joint electronic security perimeter with a reduced amount of focus on physical borders. Are the American people to understand that the 20 million plus illegal aliens imported here, including border crossers and visa overstays was a treasonous  intentional move to integrate the American culture, with people of every nationality? Is this undeniable proof that this is been deliberate moving on the part of previous and today&rsquo;s administrations? Was President Bush&rsquo;s Social Security Administration (SSA) recently signed in June 2004 a highly controversial accord that could add millions of Mexicans, some who worked here illegally, to the Social Security rolls associated with (NAU) North American Union? Is this why the 2006 Secure Fence Act was dismantled, by two Republican Texas Senators and unfunded? That the original two layer fence topped with concertina razor wire remains a dream.</p>
<p>Is this yet another reason why, the Democrats and Republicans have put every obstacle in the way of the business policing E-Verification program and the criminal national fingerprinting using Secure Communities ICE databases? Are both parties instrumental in this anti-sovereignty merger, forcing on the American citizens millions of foreign nationals demonstrating in the streets of every city and town? US politicians advocating to the North American assimilation plans are claiming &ldquo;our immigration systems are broken&rdquo; when in fact the immigration systems have been compromised by those pressing for a merger of the populations of the three countries? Perhaps this is why they want the 1986 Immigration Control &amp; Reform Act rescinded as it&rsquo;s an impediment to this cause?  These secret documents reveal a well developed plan that advocates secrecy, with an incremental approach as not to alarm the public.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more important than ever to join the PEOPLES party, the TEA PARTY. The Tea Party is for all legal Americans, naturalized citizens and those holding green cards. This un-American movement will not be tolerated, and should never be ratified without a national referendum. Our country is a nation of laws, especially when it comes to integration of other countries. Currently the Democrats desire to force on &mdash; ALL &mdash; the American peoples a new Amnesty, cloaked in Immigration Reform. Indirectly the Dream Act would have the same purpose, allowing these Students to sponsor family members. Chain Migration is already accelerating and costing Americans billions of dollars a year. Sanctuary states are another enigma, which is about sheltering foreign nationals which is California&rsquo;s and Nevada&rsquo;s cross to bare.  It&rsquo;s unfortunate we don&rsquo;t follow the same laws as countries in Europe, which is using a &ldquo;PointsSystem&rdquo; for legal immigration. Offering entry visas to the highly skilled people with profession experience in their specialized occupation, as they will not end up in the welfare offices? Today, in most cases through illegal immigration the American people are serving on a plate education to illegal children, free treatment in emergency rooms.  Join the Tea Party or after reading the Wikileak document, you should start plying your representatives in Washington, State or even local level for answers? Contact them at Senate &mdash; 202-224–3121/ House &mdash; 202-225–3121.</p>

<p>My separating these two issues comes down to how you look at the problem, I&rsquo;m talking about different policies here. To a victim of crime it matters little, it&rsquo;s horrible either way, but I think crime is a problem with a different solution than a hostile ideology bent on conquest. The first is a police issue, the second a military one. It&rsquo;s not (yet) a hot war with guns and missiles, but a war of intelligence and &#8220;hearts-and-minds&#8221;, and as of now we&rsquo;re losing because Islam is allowed to look strong in the face of weak and pathetic leadership in Europe. I&rsquo;m not downplaying black crime, it&rsquo;s just that in Europe this is a different thing, and MUCH smaller than the one you have in America.</p>
<p>BTW, my &#8220;casual&#8221; dismissal of race is because morality is CHOSEN, not determined by race. Race does play a role though, albeit smaller than many people here ascribe to it, because of genetic traits like IQ, and probably a lot more that we don&rsquo;t yet fully understand because of the lack of large scale research, and suppression of results that are &#8220;undesirable&#8221;. Large groups of low IQ immigrants are usually bad news, but Islam means WAR!</p>

<p>It matters very little about the semantics of these two issues, the end result is the same.  Blacks, Mexicans, Orientals or Muslims, it all means the dispossession of Western peoples in their own nations. Picture a world where Asia, Africa and the Middle East have burgeoning homogenous populations while Europe, North America and Oceania are populated by a shrinking White minority dominated by nonwhite populations they imported in the first place and the nonwhite controlled government is constantly bringing in more of their kin via immigration.

<p>What difference does it make whether it&rsquo;s Muslims taking over Europe or Mexicans or a Mexican/Black/Oriental coalition taking over America?  Both paths lead to the same result.  The political, economic and cultural marginalization of Europeans or people of European ancestry in their OWN COUNTRIES.  America&rsquo;s black and foreign diaspora commit crimes largely out of proportion to their populations.  So do Muslims in Europe.  Both groups have high fertility rates and are displacing the native populations.  Both groups are changing the cultural and governmental foundations of the respective nations.  Both groups are advancing their own interests which are usually diametrically opposed to White interests.

<p>You may think that there&rsquo;s a lot of support for Herman Cain simply because you read too many lamestream conservative media.  But when Republicans actually get to vote, and he gets no more than 10% of the vote in any one state (a lot of those will come from crossover white liberals voting for the weakest Republican because there is no race on the Democrat side for obvious reasons), then we&rsquo;ll all finally realize that all those lamer con blogs and websites are nothing more than exotic noisemakers.</p>
<p>I think I can present a historical analogue:  Jack Kemp&rsquo;s Presidential campaign in 1988.  Kemp&rsquo;s campaign centerpiece was tweaking (more like eviscerating) lamestream conservatism to appeal (more like pander) to black voters.  His average take in Republican Primaries in states that held primaries (i.e. not counting caucuses) was 5%.  Cain, unlike Kemp, is black, but Kemp, unlike Cain, had actually won a public political office (Congress from the Buffalo suburbs), so those two things sort of even out.  I fail to see how Cain would do much better than a 5% average, save the liberal Democrat troublemaker crossovers.  Also remember that Kemp was Bob Dole&rsquo;s running mate in 1996   &mdash;   Did Dole get any more than the usual 1% of the black vote Republicans get because he had a running mate that pandered to black voters?  No.</p>
<p>Even if you limited Republican Primary voting to those who self-identify with the Tea Party Movement (and they can prove it), Cain would get nowhere near the majority of the vote in any state.</p>
<p>As an aside, Cain was once a board member of the Kansas City division of the Federal Reserve.  Then and now, he supported TARP, quantitative easing, and opposes auditing the Fed.  As if there weren&rsquo;t already one really good and obvious reason not to vote for him or support him, there&rsquo;s another can you can put in the cooler.</p>

They have no loyalty towards, solidarity with, or concern for the average white person. This will result in their being targeted for elimination along with non-whites who attack us.They have thrown us under the wheels of the bus, betrayed us, and abandoned us. The coming global war for the very survival of the white race will be inspired, directed, and led by middle class and former middle class whites. Whites need to understand the ones who are in positions of power are not on our side. We will have to take power back from the non-whites by force, and the time will come where there is NO other alternative.</p>

		<p>#34 Anonymous is exactly right. What difference does it make if it is Muslim or Hispanic? If our disposition along with national &amp; cultural destruction is the end result the who is almost irrelevant. Islam may be more overtly violent but make no doubt that Hispanics by sheer numbers alter everything in their path. They want to celebrate Latino heritage, embrace Latino Studies, speak Spanish and generally disparage the gringo. In addition while one can argue to what degree race is involved? The fact is that race does matter in all of this.</p>

It&rsquo;s more important than ever to join the PEOPLES party, the TEA PARTY. The Tea Party is for all legal Americans, naturalized citizens and those holding green cards.

NO, a thousand times NO!I have come to detest them and GLENN BECK! They and their self righteous mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p>The Tea Party (phoney &#8220;conservatives) is just as bad as the lefties when it comes to RACE! They continually throw us under the bus to prove they aren&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221;. They only care about lowering taxes and smaller government (which is just blather, because they NEVER accomplished that when they had total control of both houses and the Presidency) Remember Reagan? Remember Newt? They didn&rsquo;t even bother closing the borders and deporting ALL illegals! Nope, Reagan gave the amnesty and Newt and his boys did NOTHING about closing the border and deporting them.</p>
<p>They refuse to connect the dots that it is ALL about LEGAL (1965) and ILLEGAL immigration! MULTIRACIALISM is KILLING US! They twist what the Founders really said about this nation is  FOR OUR PROGENY. We are not a nation &#8220;of immigrants&#8221; as they claim. Our ancestors (Whites) founded and settled this land for US!</p>
<p>The Tea Party claim they only want the illegals to obey the &#8220;law&#8221; and become legal. Then what? We have even MORE 3rd world riffraff in our country. Chain migration.</p>
<p>To PROVE what they really are, see what they are now endorsing for POTUS!</p>

		<p>Wilders message isnt that immigration of non whites is bad, Wilders message is that immigration by muslims are bad. Wilders have no solution for the hordes of chaos darkies which already infest the Netherlands. </p>
<p>Wilders Freedom Party, the Swedish Democrats, the Danish People&rsquo;s party and other belong to the same strata of cultural marxist false fronts. You see, cultural nationalism is nothing other than nationalism perverted by cultural marxism, which teaches that everything is shaped by nurture and that there are no races. Since there are no races, there are no innate behaviour, so anyone, even goat herders from central asia or child soldiers from Liberia can become a brit/german/swede by merely adapting the local customs (which usually are specified as liberal practices as feminism, racial egalitarianism, etc etc)</p>
<p>Therefore large amount of chaos darkies living in your white nation isnt bad, as long as they are &#8220;forced&#8221; (by some unspecified means) to &#8220;assimilated&#8221; (which in practice means miscegneation). </p>
<p>So in short: this guy is no hero, hes a derailer. If you want you nation to become a mestiso-mulatto nation, go ahead and vote cultural nationalist. These people are serious cultural nationalists and not disguised racists. F.ex the leadership group of the Sweden Democrats have several people with non white spouses, adopted non white children or non white racial backgrounds. Do you seriously think they will suddenly change to a racial perspective? Its more like they are working to delay and derail the counterreaction so that when it happens native whites are such a small part of the voting population that they cant vote in a white nationalist majority. </p>

		<p>&#8220;America desperately needs to find ways to bring the large numbers of influential Whites on the Liberal Left side to find some way to come to our side&hellip; consider animal rights appeals, environmentalist appeals&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are folks on the right who support animal liberation and environmental conservation. I think the divide is partly the fault of the media being successful at demonizing those on the right. I suspect it&rsquo;s more likely whites on the left, that have spent the last 50 years going along with this sort of degradation of the right, will one day cross over and vote right. For now we can just state our case as best we can and keep the doors and windows open. </p>

Oriental and Indian immigrants owe their good statistics to the fact that their ancestors have practiced civilization for thousands of years, and agriculture for an additional several thousand years.<br>

<p>Very true.<br>
In my almost 50 years in secondary education, I never had an unpleasant experience with East Asian (Chinese, Korean, Japanese,) and Indian students and parents. There was a samll number of Vietnamese boys who had this inexplicable attraction to Black slang, mannerisms and dress. Then there are the blonde White girls with cornrows. Nauseating.</p>

		<p>interesting comment thread, it certainly confirms that a lot of Americans have no absolute no clue about how close we are to losing Europe to the Islamic world.</p>
<p>Or that this conflict has been going on for 1500 years, that every border between Europe and the Islamic world has been fought over continuously for centuries.</p>
<p>Underclass problems (exacerbated by Third World immigration) are one thing.</p>
<p>Islamization is another.</p>
<p>They overlap in the sense that the majority of the Muslim community in Europe is basically a gigantic underclass which fails at school, is dependent upon welfare, and regards criminal acts against Europeans as part of the natural order of things.</p>
<p>Another overlap topic that desperately needs to be discussed:</p>
<p>alienated and violent youth all over the Islamic world seem to identify strongly with violent hip-hop culture.</p>
<p>At the same time, blacks all over the world are susceptible to Islamist propaganda as an expression of their hatred of European civilization.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap, but the problems are distinct.</p>
<p>Americans who wish for more Muslim immigration are slitting their own throats.</p>
<p>Islam is a fascist, totalitarian, authoritarian religion and political ideology which makes European fascism look kind of wimpy and halfhearted by comparison.</p>
<p>If the thought of Islam taking over Europe (or the United States the) doesn&rsquo;t make you feel like you&rsquo;ve been kicked in the gut by horse, then you are in massive denial.</p>
<p>Or radical Islam appeals to you, which is kind of a problem in itself.</p>

		<p> A surprising number of immigrants to Europe are both black and Muslim. I think Northern European countries like the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark with their long histories of pacifistic, tolerant, liberalism and lack of any practical experience dealing with nonwhite minorities; automatically reject any political movement with racial overtones. For that reason, I think Geert Wilders is taking the right path in his attempt to curtail Muslim immigration. Hopefully, all non-European immigration would eventually be banned from the Nordic countries &mdash; clearly, immigration is of limited value in these, small, crowded homogeneous Nordic countries. </p>

		<p>If we cut off immigration tomorrow would it be enough to return to a &#8216;white majority&rsquo; (@600 million) cultural condition of at least 75-80%?  No.  Those already here would simply do what they do in Mexico and Pakistan: reproduce without conscience, totally outstripping our TFRs until they filled every nook and cranny of whatever region they were in and totally choked off the local economy.  Pakistant is the size of Texas yet has a population half as large as the entire 50 states: 170 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Just Dumb.</p>
<p>If we cut off welfare tomorrow would it be enough to return to a &#8216;white majority&rsquo; as 36 + 40 + 10 million Blacks, Mexicans and Arabs decided to move out?  No.</p>
<p>As long as A/A exists, as long as there is no problem with buying a house and moving in six people to pay the mortgage, indeed _so long as the American Standard Of Living_ is so high, compared to where they came from, you will see ZERO self-deportation.</p>
<p>Third question:  Will our politicians controlled as they are by G8 globalist corporate socialists, he|| bent on &#8216;making the world their marketplace&rsquo; as a source of ever higher profits, be able or willing to SEE the quiet desparation in the majority of us and IGNORE the wailing and gnashing of teeth in the minority?</p>
<p>No.  The only thing a politicians wants after his first term is a second and a third and a fourth.  And thanks to certain elements who control the media with an iron fist, we would see endless stories of families broken up and orphans needing surgery denied until no one who supported moratoriums and repatriation could get re/elected.</p>
<p>There is nothing to save here people.  It&rsquo;s time to recognize that.</p>
<p>If you want to make the move to a zero immigration status and white culture base from exclusive white genes, you need to invest locally in bread basket states who are willing to covertly create a secessionist movement that takes advantage of -whatever- mistake our nation next makes to simply stand back and say: NO.</p>
<p>Hating Arabs for 20+ years has got us in debt up to our eyeballs <br>
with no physical returns worth mentioning in oil or security (closed borders = no smuggled nukes).</p>
<p>The next Libya or Iraq should be the moment when a select group of us takes a step back and &#8216;joins the world&rsquo; in condemning more U.S. foreign policy adventurism.  And while they are busy congratulating us and themselves on finally getting their point across, we should take another step back.</p>
<p>And declare our sovereignity as an indpendent nation.</p>
<p>This is what is wrong with Mr. Wilders&rsquo; ideas.  They propose blanket white solidarity as authority to fight a largely European problem (in the Mediterranean).  It&rsquo;s -not- our affair.</p>
<p>Wake up folks, George Washington _told us_ not to get involved in European affairs!  We did so, twice, and now look at where we are.</p>
<p>OTOH, if we create a separate, white, nation; what the Europeans do to follow us will be more dictated by example than by rhetoric.  It only takes one white, western, country to stand up and say _NO_ to the multicultists and dozens more, &#8216;yearning to breathe free&rsquo; will point and say: &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t we do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>45 - John E.: &#8220;That argument was also used against European immigrants. During World War II German immigrants, and their descendents did their part. My father was one. General Dwight Eisenhower was another.&#8221; - Please look up &#8220;American Bund Party&#8221;. Otherwise, yes, German-Americans did their part in helping to defeat Nazi Germany, but two (or more) wrongs on immigration do not make a right. German immigrants to America have both assimilated and made what are considered to be positive contributions to our society at rates I would guess are higher than their percentage of population.  The fact is though, that as awesome as the Germans are, German or any other ethnic immigration modified the Anglo-American stock of the U.S. citizenry to the point that our ethnic makeup was significantly changed forever. So yes, we had problems in the beginning with various White European immigration, and we can now say that those groups assimilated well. Based on the world&rsquo;s experience with immigration, we&rsquo;ve gotten lucky. The question now though, is if we wish to take a risk on bringing in non-White, and particularly anti-White and anti-American immigrants and then HOPE for the same outcome. Additionally, even if the outcome is good, even if Mexicans and Islamists bring about some great change that SOME would think positive, there are I believe, many others who would rather live in a less great society that is homogenous and ethinically White. </p>

<p>That depends upon which stats you are concerned with.  Indians may be low on the sort of crime stats that blacks and hispanics, Pakis, are high on, but they are high on business scams and high on faking credentials.  Even though Indians are often cordial and even pleasant to deal with, this does not mean that they ought to replace or marry into white populations in their nations.  And many Indians want nothing more than to mate with a white.  Indians value lighter skin in every case, and the men seem to have obsessions regarding White women.</p>

<p>That makes no sense in the USA.  If we deported every single Muslim, we would still have 35% of our population non-white.  Whites would still be a minority within a generation.  It would still soon become impossible for remotely conservative candidates to win national elections.  Black crime(which is far more severe than Muslim crime in Europe) would still be here.  Mexicans would still take control of the Southwest.  Immigrants will still push whites out of jobs and set up their own exclusive enclaves.  Our worst enemies would still be firmly in control of the government, media, finance and academia.  Almost nothing would change.  </p>

		<p>#47 <i> The 10,000 Year Explosion should be read by those considering immigration policy. </i></p>
<p>The theory of that book is bollocks. Swedes, Norwegians, Finns were the last to build urban societies and never were as dependent on agriculture as the people of far more southern lands. If you would just go by that criteria, I would like to point out that ancient Sumer, located in present day Iraq, had large scale agriculture and cities with 200 000 inhabitants when proto swedes were transitioning into bronze age and agriculture. So, therefore immigration from Scandinavia should be banned, and immigration from the Middle East encouraged, if you were to follow the advice of that book. </p>
<p>A far simpler and far more accurate explanation is given by evolutionary psychology, which simply states that different environments give rise to different mental traits and abilities.<br>
The environment in sparsely populated sub arctic Scandinavia was and is very different to the environment in the warm and densely populated middle east. The primary threat in the Scandinavian case was nature, and in middle east groups of other people.</p>
<p>Arabs, kurds, jews, palestinians etc are descended from people who are naturally clannish and very, very, very persistent fighters because everyone who wasn&rsquo;t got outcompeted and outbred. <br>
Swedes and finns come from people who benefited from helping each other survive. </p>
