<h1>Voodoo Ritual, Sex Gone Awry Caused Fatal NYC Fire</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colleen Long, San Francisco Chronicle, February 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The blaze started around 6:40 p.m. Sunday, when a woman visited a fourth-floor apartment in Brooklyn and paid a man $300 to perform a mystical ceremony that would bring her good luck, according to fire marshals with the Fire Department of New York.</p>
<p>The man was known in the neighborhood as a priest, and the two were either having sex, or had sex when the fire started from the candles on the floor, though it&rsquo;s not clear if it was part of the ceremony, said the official, who had direct knowledge of the case but spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.</p>
<p>Instead of calling 911, the man first tried to put out the fire himself using water from a bathroom sink. As smoke began to gather, one of the other apartment occupants opened a window and propped the hall door open in an attempt to dissipate the plume. But instead, wind gusts shot the flames back inside, creating &#8220;a blowtorch effect&#8221; that pushed the fire into the hallway, the FDNY said.</p>
<p>{snip} The blaze engulfed the fourth, fifth and sixth floors, causing the floor and part of the roof to collapse. It took nearly 200 firefighters about seven hours to bring the five-alarm blaze under control.</p>
<p>One resident, 64-year-old Mary Feagin, was found dead. Her cause of death has not yet been determined and was pending further study, the medical examiner&rsquo;s office said Friday.</p>
<p>Eleven residents and 20 firefighters were injured, and nearly 50 families were left without a home.</p>

		<p>Candles are dangerous, that&rsquo;s the story here.  Churches use them, people use them, fires happen.  Haitians might be a bit sloppy and unused to more than camping conditions, but that is all there is here.</p>
<p>But yes, you guessed it; I don&rsquo;t see a religion that believes in talking snakes, virgin births with horny ghosts, and the dead rising any less superstitious than a sex rite for good luck.  In fact, I think I feel more lucky after a good round of lovemaking than before or without it.</p>

		<p>Most of you posting here on this board probably have had little contact with actual Haitians.  I have had plenty.  They are supremely superstitious in a way that you can hardly fathom unless you experience it.  </p>
<p>Every Haitian I know save one also talks really loudly, cusses all the time, is quick to anger and shout and has a hard time conforming to any polite mannerisms.  </p>
<p>I worked with one Haitian woman for two years.  Holy moley she had a mouth on her and she yelled at people with impunity.  She got away with it because she was black, of course, but we were all afraid of upsetting her so we acted all pins and needles around here.  The one American black man who worked with us used to push her buttons because he thought it was so funny to see her explode.  </p>

Mary Feagin doesn&rsquo;t sound like a Haitian name to me. </p>

<p>#1, religious people may believe all kinds of weird things, but in General the variety that you are knocking are the kind that have built those kind of houses, among a lot of other things, and not so much burning them down because of careless &#8220;lovemaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>But isn&rsquo;t this true for American blacks? I find it difficult to distinguish a rapper from a voodoo worshiper. They all act just like Somalis fighting over a sack of donated wheat flour.</p>

		<p>According to Whiteplight, Christianity = Voodoo.</p>
<p>Whiteplight never passes up an opportunity to bash Christianity and its believers and will even go as far as to voice his disdain for the faithful while commenting on stories where it&rsquo;s totally irrelevant.</p>
<p>Those with an interest in human psychology are left wondering what in Whiteplight&rsquo;s past spurred this irrational loathing of the followers of Jesus and their faith. People with an ax to grind always have a story.</p>

		<p>I live in NYC.  On the local news, more often than not, the fires are in minority neighborhoods.  Why?</p>
