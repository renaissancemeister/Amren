<h1>DeKalb Judge Accused of Numerous Violations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bill Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A DeKalb County State Court judge misused public funds, used probationers for an election campaign and neglected her court calendar, causing inexcusable delays, alleges a document filed Friday, the judge&rsquo;s last day in office.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Georgia Supreme Court, the state Judicial Qualifications Commission accused Judge Barbara Mobley of 16 violations of the judicial code of conduct, including using government funds to buy a church choir robe and prohibiting members of the public to enter her courtroom while court was in session.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the other alleged violations cited by the commission, Mobley:</p>
<p>* used public employees for her personal matters, including the use of a law clerk to represent her personal interests in civil litigation;</p>
<p>* used probationers to work at her church and to work on a judge&rsquo;s election campaign;</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
* allowed &#8220;an extensive travel schedule&#8221; to take precedence over her court calendar, resulting in &#8220;excessive delays and inexcusable neglect&#8221; of her case load; and</p>
<p>* directed law enforcement personnel to compile Georgia Crime Information Center reports and motor vehicle information of private citizens for non-legitimate law enforcement or judicial purposes.</p>

		<p>Typical black work ethic and corruption.  I&rsquo;m sure this is just the very tippity tip of the problem.  MSM does a very good job of keeping this sort of thing out of the public eye until it becomes impossible to hide any longer.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m curious in the last 10 years or so how may of these cases have we heard? Blacks at some level of power abusing the power. I would love to see the numbers, I bet the percentages are extremely high.  </p>

		<p>I am delighted to find that black judges are not immune from corruption investigations.</p>
<p>but make no mistake about it: </p>
<p>there are plenty of white judges imprisoned for incredible criminal acts performed from the bench - things that make the about look like spitting on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>many a white charge has been filmed by FBI agents accepting suitcases full of cash from mobsters.</p>
<p>not every issue is black and white!!</p>

		<p>elitist, you are correct. Many white judges and other public officials commit similar crimes.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the doctrine of &#8220;proportionality&#8221; we see that black officials seem to be disproportionately represented in this group.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell if proportionality applies. As we all know, if black students are not represented proportionally in colleges, then we need to remedy this. If black people are imprisoned disproportionately, then we need to remedy this. However, there is no need to redress the disproportionate number of blacks in the NBA or NFL.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, this is just typical of what&rsquo;s going on in the Atlanta metro area, of which Dekalb County is a part. The governments of the metro Atlanta area are run by blacks and they&rsquo;re all train wrecks&hellip;full of corruption, incompetence, and ignorant people. Taxpayers are screwed regularly having to pay for this travesty.</p>

		<p>True story: About 5 years ago, I was in Mobley&rsquo;s courtroom waiting (and waiting) for my case to be reached and I witnessed perhaps the most bizarre ruling I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. A hearing was called in another case on a defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment (this is a motion alleging that the undisputed evidence in the record entitles a party to a judgment as a matter of law and that there is no need for a jury to decide the facts). Rather than responding to the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer made an oral motion for continuance, without having any legal grounds for same. </p>
<p>Judge Mobley - who looked confused throughout - took the plaintiff&rsquo;s oral motion for continuance &#8220;under advisement,&#8221; then said she would issue a ruling within 7 days, dismissed the attorneys, and called the next case. The courtroom was stunned, the defendant&rsquo;s attorney was understandably outraged, and even the non-lawyers in the courtroom could see the absurdity in the Judge&rsquo;s ruling   &mdash;    &mdash;   Even if the Judge eventually decided to deny the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for continuance, the defendant&rsquo;s motion was pushed off onto the next month&rsquo;s calendar, which is exactly what the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer wanted. Mobley essentailly granted the plaintiff a continuence to which he was not entitled simply because she was not able to make a ruling on the bench. In fact, she took everything under advisement that day; I&rsquo;m not sure she even listened to what was being said. </p>
<p>She is an unmitigated disaster as a Judge but really no different than all of the other black &#8220;jurists&#8221; that plague the ATL. Many lawyers (myself included) intentionally avoid filing cases in Dekalb and Fulton counties for this very reason. </p>
