<h1>The Black Side of Sundance</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Walker, The Root, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For those bemoaning the lack of diversity in the Oscar nominations, they can at least take heart in knowing that diversity at the Sundance Film Festival is alive and well and flourishing, with no fewer than a combined 30 black filmmakers and films.</p>
<p>2011 is proving to be a banner year for black films and black filmmakers at the festival, which wrapped yesterday. This year, there were more features, documentaries and shorts by blacks and about blacks than at any other time in the prestigious festival&rsquo;s history, which began in 1978 as the Utah/U.S. Film Festival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even without snaring the top award, black-themed films fared well in terms of awards. The documentary Being Elmo: A Puppeteer&rsquo;s Journey, about Kevin Clash, the black man behind the fuzzy red monster, was given a special jury award, while the audience award for world dramatic feature went to Kinyarwanda, a film about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Kinyarwanda director and writer Alrick Brown, who was also mentored by Spike Lee while attending NYU film school, remembers his first time at Sundance as very different from today. &#8220;In 2005 it was two or three days before I saw another black person,&#8221; says Brown, adding that he was &#8220;blown away by how white it was.&#8221; Now he calls it &#8220;the perfect black storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>That storm certainly blew a lot of black people into town. You could not walk down Main Street in Park City without seeing another person of color. {snip}</p>
<p>Prior to the festival, OWN bought Becoming Chaz, a documentary about Sonny and Cher&rsquo;s daughter, Chastity Bono, becoming a man. In 2009 Oprah swooped in and helped Lee Daniels get a distribution deal for Precious. So far there is no word on whether she will come to the aid of any of this year&rsquo;s black films.</p>
<p>Kinyarwanda is still without a distributor. Pariah, however, got picked up during the festival by Focus Features for what&rsquo;s being reported as a high-six-figure deal, and for some filmmakers that&rsquo;s like hitting the jackpot. {snip}</p>
<p>Director and writer Rashaad Ernesto Green, whose mother is Puerto Rican and father is African American, also won a distribution deal for his first feature, Gun Hill Road. The movie, which was picked up by Motion Film Group in a seven-figure deal, is another coming-out and coming-of-age story. It stars Esai Morales, who also co-produced the film with an African-American producer, Ron Simons. Morales says, &#8220;Sundance has gotten back to a place where they are focusing on diversity.&#8221; Green, another NYU alum mentored by Spike Lee, says, &#8220;It feels like there is a movement going on&#8221; at Sundance  &mdash;  a movement that he is eager to join.</p>
<p>Green took part in several events at Sundance geared toward black filmmakers, including one with the Blackhouse Foundation, an Institute Associate of Sundance. Dolly Turner, one of the Blackhouse directors, credits the foundation&rsquo;s involvement over the past five years with increasing diversity at Sundance. &#8220;If we are there to help black filmmakers, then people, take note,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Another black presence at the festival this year was the African-American Film Festival Releasing Movement (AFFRM). It&rsquo;s the brainchild of Ava DuVernay, a filmmaker and publicist who is trying to create a distribution network for black films. For DuVernay, who has taken to calling Sundance &#8220;Blackdance,&#8221; it&rsquo;s not a question of why they chose so many black filmmakers and films to spotlight this year, but &#8220;how can we make sure it continues next year,&#8221; and &#8220;why not every year?&#8221;<br>

		<p>If this is to become a &#8220;Blackdance,&#8221; a black-dominated, or even a diversity-emphasis film festival, why not move it to a different place rather than &#8220;white&#8221; Utah?  Another example of a festival originally created for all peoples to turn into  a &#8220;minority-majority&#8221; institution, and, probably, into decline as the (white) people who originally supported and financed it lose interest or are pushed out.</p>

		<p>&#8220;For DuVernay, who has taken to calling Sundance &ldquo;Blackdance,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not a question of why they chose so many black filmmakers and films to spotlight this year, but &ldquo;how can we make sure it continues next year,&rdquo; and &ldquo;why not every year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was never about equality, it was about this; a declared takeover in politics, economics, and entertainment.  The goal of the black community is to first gain entrance and then takeover everything.  Other &#8220;minorities&#8221; see the advantage and join in.  Why not just change the name to what it is - The Black Entertainment Festival?</p>
<p>We need another coountry.</p>

		<p>THe &#8220;perfect black storm&#8221; is an apt description of what is happening to our whole society. As with any massive storm, whites, their entire culture, their entire way of life, their entire mode of being is being inundated and destroyed by black &#8220;culture&#8221;, ways of being, outlooks, and &#8220;standards&#8221;. A &#8220;perfect&#8221; storm means that it is affecting every part of our lives. And that is the case. </p>
<p>We are losing our culture, we are losing our way of life, and the storm is destroying us! We will lose, because many in our ranks take their position in life, their culture, their way of being, for granted. They assume that they will always have it their way. They might live only long enough to experience the benefits of past ages of whiteness. But their offspring, or, surely, the offspring of their offspring, will suffer for the ignorance of their forebears. </p>
<p>However, despite my dour prophecy, we still have one choice&hellip;. We don&rsquo;t have to patronize their movies. If I see one on television, no matter how great, i turn it off or change the channel. Denzel! Morgan! It doesn&rsquo;t matter! I turn them off, or change the channel. I do the same with all of their sports as well. No matter how hard the winds of this storm blow, they can&rsquo;t make me like or watch them! So, who cares about Sundance? Let the &#8220;elites&#8221; and their toadies watch all of the black films they want! If they don&rsquo;t make it in the marketplace, they mean little. So, let the blowhards blow! At least that doesn&rsquo;t matter!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m guessing there are more blacks in film making than there are conservatives, although a leftist filmmaker might be as good a stand in as a black one?</p>

		<p>The quality of entertainment has been going downhill for years&hellip;  As more and more minorities corrupt the message of films and TV, I watch less and less.  This bodes ill for the future.</p>

		<p>In my humble opinion current entertainment (term used loosely) is one of the reasons for the rise of satellite -and perhaps - cable television. Our house, along with most people we talk to about it have the intermediate level of satellite tv, excluding any premium movie channels. That gives us access to relatively decent television: History Channel, AMC, HGTV, NatGeo, along with many related channels and the Encore movie channels (on which my husband dearly loves to watch old Westerns). There are no tv series&rsquo; whatsoever that we watch and I can&rsquo;t tell you the last time I actually paid to watch a movie (I think it was Crocodile Dundee). Between the lousy actors, lousy writers, the swarm of minority-favoring story lines, completely nonsensical interracial relationships and the special effects on steriods there is nothing fit to watch elsewhere. </p>
