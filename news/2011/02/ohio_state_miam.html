<h1>Ohio State, Miami Universities Accused of Racial Bias in Admissions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Encarnacion Pyle, Columbus Dispatch, February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group that fights race-based admissions policies at colleges says Ohio State and Miami universities discriminate against white and Asian students by favoring black applicants.</p>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity released a study this morning that {snip} says black students were favored at Miami by a ratio of 10-1 over white students with similar ACT scores, and that the ratio at Ohio State was 8-to-1. When comparing students with similar SAT scores, the group found a ratio of 8-1 ratio at Miami and 3-to-1 at Ohio State.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study shows that many, many students are rejected in favor of students with lower test scores and grades, and the reason is that they have the wrong skin color or their ancestors came from the wrong countries,&#8221; CEO chairwoman Linda Chavez said in a statement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As a state land-grant institution we value having a diverse group of students in our classrooms,&#8221; he [Dolan Evanovich, vice president for strategic enrollment planning at Ohio State] said.</p>
<p>Miami&rsquo;s website also says &#8220;potential contributions to diversity&#8221; is among the factors the school considers. {snip}<br/>

		<p>Liberals love blacks. They worship them. They&rsquo;re incapable of controlling their adulation for them. Any chance they have at uplifiting their precious &#8216;African-Americans&rsquo; they jump at it. And liberals dominate colleges, hence the widespread, pervasive bias against white applicants. To make things even more pathetic, Ohio &#8216;State&rsquo; is subsidized by mostly white taxpayers. </p>

		<p>C&rsquo;mon, people   &mdash;   this has been standard practice for DECADES!!!  You cannot POSSIBLY be surprised here.  The thing is, whites are very leery of going to blacks who got preferential treatment in colleges - just as &#8220;you can&rsquo;t make a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear,&#8221; you can&rsquo;t make a top-quality physician or dentist out of a student who was of inferior quality to begin with.  If Michael Jackson had realized this, he might be here today.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A pair of Princeton researchers, studying the admissions process at America&rsquo;s elite universities, found an almost identical level of discrimination against better qualified whites. </p>
<p>Highlights from a report in MindingtheCampus.com:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and his colleague Alexandria Radford is a real eye-opener in revealing just what sorts of students highly competitive colleges want   &mdash;   or don&rsquo;t want   &mdash;   on their campuses and how they structure their admissions policies to get the kind of &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; they seek. The Espenshade/Radford study draws from a new data set, the National Study of College Experience (NSCE), which was gathered from eight highly competitive public and private colleges and universities (entering freshmen SAT scores: 1360).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Race has a profound effect on one&rsquo;s chances of admission, all other things being equal:</p>
<p>&#8220;The box students checked off on the racial question on their application was thus shown to have an extraordinary effect on a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the highly competitive private schools in the NSCE database. To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550.&#8221;</p>
<p>The depth of the discrimination against lower-class whites is particularly shocking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.  These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed. Their diversity-enhancement value was obviously rated very low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do elite universities have a profound bias against lower-income whites, all other things equal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;since they [universities] have a limited amount of money to give out for scholarship aid, they reserve this money to lure those who can be counted in their enrollment statistics as diversity-enhancing &lsquo;racial minorities.&rsquo; Poor whites are apparently given little weight as enhancers of campus diversity, while poor non-whites count twice in the diversity tally, once as racial minorities and a second time as socio-economically deprived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ugly truth is that most colleges, especially the more competitive private ones, are fiercely concerned with their ratings by rating organizations like U.S. News &amp; World Report. And an important part of those ratings consist of a numerical acceptance rate (the ratio of applicants received to those accepted) and a yield score (the ratio of those accepted to those who enroll). The lower the acceptance rate and the higher the yield score the more favorably colleges are looked upon. In extending admissions to well-qualified but financially strapped whites who are unlikely to enroll, a college would be driving both its acceptance rate and its yield score in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s new is the discovery of heavy bias against applicants who have had leadership roles in 4H clubs, Future Farmers of America and ROTC:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;what Espenshade and Radford found in regard to what they call &#8220;career-oriented activities&#8221; was truly shocking even to this hardened veteran of the campus ideological and cultural wars. Participation in such Red State activities as high school ROTC, 4-H clubs, or the Future Farmers of America was found to reduce very substantially a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the competitive private colleges in the NSCE database on an all-other-things-considered basis. The admissions disadvantage was greatest for those in leadership positions in these activities or those winning honors and awards. &#8220;Being an officer or winning awards&#8221; for such career-oriented activities as junior ROTC, 4-H, or Future Farmers of America, say Espenshade and Radford, &lsquo;has a significantly negative association with admission outcomes at highly selective institutions.&rsquo; Excelling in these activities &lsquo;is associated with 60 or 65 percent lower odds of admission.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>

		<p>This is more proof that blacks are admitted based on skin color and without regard to intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>This is a world turned upside down. A place of higher learning where the future of society rests chooses as its members a collection of the dumbest applicants.</p>
<p>This also marks ALL blacks as affirmative action dimwits - something blacks are obviously too dense to figure out.</p>

		<p>This gives strong incentive for White college applicants to misrepresent their race by claiming to be an &#8220;under represented minority.&#8221;  Unless such a problem became widespread, the University would have no incentive to look into whether White applicants were lying about their race.  In fact, the only applicant data that is verified is the students GPA and college entrance exam.  Racial data is strictly on the honor system.</p>
<p>No longer are student photos required as part of the application.  A check of the &#8220;black&#8221; box benefits the university by increasing the strength of their incoming class, while increasing their black population, at least on paper.</p>

		<p>This does not matter too much, even if it does matter of course.</p>
<p>According to the deep research in the Bell Curve that Murray and Herrnstein produced, people of high IQ&rsquo;s tend to get where they are destined with or without education.</p>
<p>When they compared the earnings of those without any good(or any at all) education but who did have a fairly high IQ, it corresponded almost identically with those who did have the education.</p>
<p>The only difference is that those who had the education usually got higher starting salaries, but this was remedied by those without College education for their earlier work years.</p>
<p>I think the difference was only 1-2 % once they reach their mid-30s.</p>
<p>And, I might add, this is true across the board. </p>
<p>These discriminated whites will continue to rise in society. In fact, they&rsquo;re likely to get better as they have to struggle on their own and they won&rsquo;t rely on affirmative action or any other socialist effect to prop them up.</p>
<p>They are early taught the ethics of work and self-reliance and this is in huge contrast to the dumb, ineffective black who preys on the sympathy of the self-hating liberals(white or non-white).</p>
<p>And, finally, this will also make them racially conscious, which all of us aim for, as an unintended side-effect. They will be deeply aware of the Europhobic bigotry that permeates the American society.</p>
<p>These whites might lose in the short term but they will do much better in the long term. And how good is college these days anyway? It&rsquo;s getting more and more expensive for worse and worse quality as the dumbing down is increased exponentially to accomodate the less gifted who are often there because of their skincolor rather than their actual intellectual capability.</p>

		<p>The answer.  When your children enroll in high school be sure to check black or hispanic as their race.  What race you choose will depend on your last name.</p>
<p>Being black will ensure that your average 110 IQ child will get a full ride to an Ivy League university.  Your child won&rsquo;t have to do much worrying about finding a job after graduation.</p>
<p>Beginning in their junior year employers will swamp your black or hispanic child with offere.  And it won&rsquo;t matter that your child is really White.  All the employers care about is the statistics they are bound by law to provide to anti White racist gestapo agencies like EEOC, Justice dept etc.</p>
<p>Whites can do nothing to reverse the discrimination process.  So protect yourself and your children.</p>

		<p>Blacks are NOT chosen because of the COLOR of their SKIN but their race; Asian-Indians often have skin darker than many Blacks but we are classified as &#8220;Asian&#8221; and held to higher academic standards than whites. Many rural whites would mistake me for black based on appearance despite my 140 IQ and my engineering background.</p>
