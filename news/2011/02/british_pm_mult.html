<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41444364/ns/world_news-europe/">British PM: Multiculturalism Has Failed</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, February 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Prime Minister David Cameron, in a speech attended by world leaders, on Saturday criticized his country&rsquo;s longstanding policy of multiculturalism, saying it was an outright failure and partly to blame for fostering Islamist extremism.</p>
<p>He said the U.K. needs a stronger national identity to prevent people turning to extremism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and the mainstream,&#8221; Cameron said during a panel discussion attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. &#8220;We have failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the &#8220;hands-off tolerance&#8221; in Britain and other European nations has encouraged Muslims and other immigrant groups &#8220;to live separate lives, apart from each other and the mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Muslim groups in the U.K. quickly condemned the remarks. Among them was the Muslim Council of Britain, which receives government money for projects intended to combat extremism. The council said that the Muslim community was still being treated &#8220;as part of the problem as opposed to part of the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cameron&rsquo;s remarks echoed statements made last year by Merkel last year, when she also called multiculturalism a failure.<br/>

<p>Don&rsquo;t anyone take this as an indication the LibLabCon is going to change. They&rsquo;ve simply realized the problem is too big to ignore. Now, they&rsquo;ll use this as a pretext to impose <i>more</i> forced integration. They&rsquo;ve changed the rhetoric but will push the same failed policies even harder.</p>

		<p>His rhetoric doesn&rsquo;t fool me.  All he&rsquo;s saying is that Muslims aren&rsquo;t becoming part of a multicultural multiracial &#8220;tolerant&#8221; Britain fast enough.  In other words, they&rsquo;re resisting being dragged into the melting pot.</p>
<p>This is NOT a &#8220;Rivers of Blood&#8221; type speech.</p>
<p>But it is a feeble attempt on Cameron&rsquo;s part to fool enough (white) people to save his coalition government.  Even though the next election isn&rsquo;t until May 2015 in theory.  If it gets any more unpopular, there probably will be new elections sooner than that.</p>

		<p>A good sign and BIG precedent but I do wonder if the elites are just testing public reaction considering that Cameron isn&rsquo;t getting censured and the BNP failed. We&rsquo;ll see</p>

		<p>As long as the Brittish continue to invite millions of third worlders in the problem will only get worse.Mere sound bites from Cameron. For the UK, i&rsquo;m afraid the dye is cast, it&rsquo;s too late. Have you been to London,Birmingham or Manchester lately.</p>

<p>Just like our &#8220;Friend and Ally&#8221; in Egypt, Mubarak; as long as we pay, we have Muslim friends.  Take the money away and find out who is really your friend and who practices a &#8220;religion of peace.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What Cameron means of course, is that Britain must<br/>
learn to become more Islamic. Only then will there<br/>
be a &#8220;stronger national identity&#8221; that can allow<br/>
muslims to feel at home. It will not work. Its a complete<br/>
and shallow misunderstanding of culture (shallow is always<br/>
the watchword when dealing with Cameron). Culture is<br/>
like personality only much more intractable. Two people<br/>
with opposite emotions, beliefs, and even genetics<br/>
cant get along. Every word they say irritates the other party.<br/>
Trying to smother it all doesnt bring reconciliation it<br/>
brings underlying diffences to slow boil. So what is Cameron<br/>
going to do now? Demand Britain change itself more? That way<br/>
lies more white resentment. Demand muslims to change..? That<br/>
leads to more extremism and terrorism. The only way out is forced<br/>
deportations of muslims who are now UK subjects..which is <br/>
illegal. &#8220;The first thing we do is kill all the lawyers&#8221; Shakespeare said concerning an earlier English popular revolution.</p>

		<p>From other articles its clearer he wasn&rsquo;t talking about stopping muslim immigration but rather moving from what he calls &#8216;pasive liberalism&rsquo; to &#8216;aggressive liberalism&rsquo;, and no longer taking a &#8216;hands off approach&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is a step in the right direction as taking an &#8216;aggressive&rsquo; approach to muslims and telling them they must change will fail spectacularly quickly rather than the 15+ years its taken for the &#8216;passive&rsquo; approach.  Hopefully they will then realise multicultralism is a weakness.  Saddly this will probably come at the cost of many lives.</p>
<p>His comment &ldquo;We have failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.&rdquo; sounds scary.  Who&rsquo;s vision?  What happens to the native English if they don&rsquo;t want to conform to it?</p>

He&rsquo;s still being cautious and not going far enough. He seems to believe that multiCULTuralism has failed because we&rsquo;re not doing it right; as if there is a way to make it work.</p>

		<p>    There is hope that the West is beginning to awaken and some tiny sliver of who we used to be can be saved . But I see little hope that the West will be able to maintain what used to undeniably be their&rsquo;s .There&rsquo;s just too much damage already done . Best case scenario, Muslim kingdoms will be carved out of what used to be Christian Europe and REAL Europeans will be forced to co-exist with them in a guarded, perpetual, Cold War type existencea . </p>

		<p>I have lived in germany for 15 years.</p>
<p>the mood in Europe has shifted drastically since 9/11 - even in the past 2 years, and things are speeding up.</p>
<p>multiculti &amp; mass 3rd world immigration, underclass slums and crime epidemics, race riots and mass welfarism: <br/>
all of these sicknesses are  are new to Europe, and when I moved here in 95, it was like going back in time 45 years. </p>
<p>by now, england is almost past saving, and conservative elites like Cameron are probably shell shocked at the realization of how far things have deteriorated. </p>
<p>I believe he is sincerely revolted by what Gr Br has become.</p>

		<p>I got this story in my email and sent it to everyone on my list.  FINALLY!!!  And it wasn&rsquo;t just Cameron   &mdash;   the German Chancellor Merkel ALSO said (before Cameron did) that multiculturalism is a failure.  We know the Danes think so too.  So we need to take this as a basis and build on it - it needs to be made clear to the USA public as well, so that we can stop illegal immigration and deport illegals AND all who are here to destroy our nation (read Muslims) before it&rsquo;s too late.  It may be already   &mdash;   but I&rsquo;m one who will go down fighting rather than just passively let them take over.</p>
