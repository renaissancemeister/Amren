			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AOL News, February 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. racial minorities accounted for roughly 85 percent of the nation&rsquo;s population growth over the last decade  &mdash;  one of the largest shares ever  &mdash;  with Hispanics accounting for much of the gain in many of the states picking up new House seats.</p>
<p>Preliminary census estimates also suggest the number of multiracial Americans jumped roughly 20 percent since 2000, to over 5 million.</p>
<p>{snip} New Jersey, Mississippi, Virginia and Louisiana are the first to receive the census redistricting data, which will be used in the often contentious process of redrawing political districts based on population and racial makeup.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are going to be a lot of additional Hispanic officials elected when redistricting is done,&#8221; said E. Mark Braden, a former chief counsel to the Republican National Committee who now advises state governments on redistricting. &#8220;But folks in power don&rsquo;t give up control that easily  &mdash;  there will be tension between the ins and outs.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four of the eight states gaining House seats owe roughly half or more of their population gains over the last decade to Hispanics. They include Texas, which picks up four seats; Florida, which will add two seats; and Arizona and Nevada, picking up one seat apiece.</p>
<p>In Georgia and Washington state, which also gain one seat each, Hispanics combined with other minority groups accounted for a majority of their growth since 2000.</p>
<p>Among states losing House seats, Louisiana and New Jersey each would have posted a net population loss, and Michigan would have sustained bigger declines, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Hispanic growth. Latinos also made up roughly 60 percent or more of the growth in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa and Massachusetts  &mdash;  which each lose a seat  &mdash;  raising questions as to whether remaining districts in those states will need to accommodate emerging Hispanic voting blocs.</p>
<p>Broken down by voting age, minorities accounted for roughly 70 percent of U.S. growth in the 18-and-older population since 2000, and Hispanics made up about 40 percent. Hispanics also represented more than half the growth share of the voting-age population in Texas and California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which successfully challenged the redrawing of a majority Hispanic Texas district that weakened the Latino vote after the 2000 census, said his group was expecting to see &#8220;a minimum of nine additional Latino-majority House seats&#8221; based on 2010 results, if states comply with federal law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jeffrey M. Wice, a Democratic redistricting attorney, said states also will have to decide whether to consider citizenship when drawing political lines. Many lower federal courts have ruled that citizenship data should be used if available to determine whether a minority voting bloc has been unduly weakened  &mdash;  an issue that could mix already intense redistricting fights with contentious immigration politics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new area, and the Supreme Court has largely been silent on the issue,&#8221; Wice said. &#8220;In some places, the use of citizenship data may dilute the ability of Hispanic communities to be fairly redistricted. Republicans may attempt to base redistricting on citizenship data in New Jersey, so that is one state to keep an eye on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The preliminary demographic numbers are based on the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey as of March 2010, as well as comparisons of the 2000 census with 2009 demographic estimates and the 2009 American Community Survey, which samples 3 million U.S. households. According to those figures, minorities represented between 81 percent and 89 percent of the U.S. population growth since 2000, higher than the official 80 percent share in 2000.</p>
<p>The minority growth share in 2010 is the largest in recent memory, with only the influx of European minority immigrants such as Italians, Poles and Jews in the late 1800s possibly rivaling it in scope, said William H. Frey, a demographer at Brookings Institution who analyzed the census data.</p>
<p><b>Other findings:</b></p>
<p>  &mdash;  In all, non-Hispanic whites make up roughly 65 percent of the U.S. population, down from 69 percent in 2000. Hispanics had a 16 percent share, compared with 13 percent a decade ago. Blacks represent about 12 percent and Asians roughly 5 percent. Multiracial Americans and other groups made up the remaining 2 percent.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  California, Texas, New York and Hawaii were among the states with the largest number of people who identified themselves as multiracial.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Some 40 states show population losses of white children since 2000 due to declining birth rates. Minorities represented all of the increases in the under-18 population in Texas and Florida, and most of the gains in the child population in Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new engines of growth in America&rsquo;s population are Hispanics, Asians and other minorities,&#8221; Frey said. {snip}<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s putting a positive tone on something that should be received with alarm. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like shouting, &#8220;Hooray. Interracial conflict and misery are on their way!&#8221;    </p>

		<p> The maliciously gleeful tone of this Associated Press story   &mdash;   written by Hope Yen, who is probably of Chinese extraction   &mdash;   is unmistakable. Behind the usual reporterage construction, one can hear, &#8220;Your day is almost done in this country, White devils! We are out-breeding and out illegal-immigranting you, roundeye/honkey/gringo! Soon you will be an aging, powerless minority in a new America made up of &#8216;people of color&rsquo; which will bear no resemblance to your racist country!&#8221;</p>
<p> But then, that&rsquo;s no surprise, coming from the Associated Press, which has flown on the Left wing of American politics for lo these many years. Notice how the story didn&rsquo;t even mention the White majority until many paragraphs down   &mdash;   and then only to note that we had declined to 65 percent of the entire population, from 69 percent 10 years ago. More malicious glee and smacking of lips at European America&rsquo;s presumed imminent demise.</p>

		<p>Remember that all Jews, Arabs, Turks, Persians, Kurds, Armenians, Azeris etc. are counted as white in the census.  These Middle Eastern groups together have to add up to at least 3% of the population and probably closer to 5%.   </p>

		<p>They won&rsquo;t be so gleeful when the numbers reverse themselves and it&rsquo;s only 30 percent paying taxes and 70 percent taking federal largesse.  One can hope that we will see many new immigration laws and enforcements.  We are hearing the beginnings of those rumblings.  America has a choice to make.  Turn this around, and quickly, be picky about who we allow to legally immigrate - OR - become like Zimbabwe and Mexico.<br>
No middle ground is possible.  We are NOT importing Mexican rocket scientists and Zimbabwean or Somalian brain surgeons.  And even if we did, would YOU sit in a Mexican made rocket and tell them to &#8220;light this candle&#8221; or undergo brain surgery by a Somalian?</p>

<p>You are correct and we all need to remember this and point to these facts to other TRUE racially aware Whites at every opportunity. Most Whites think we are still the majority due to these bogus claims on the census reports.  I will wager that it is even more than 5% that claim they are &#8220;white&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I recently saw on the news, a baseball stadium full of new immigrants being sworn in as citizens. I did not see even one white person. The liberal media was marveling at how many new African immigrants there were, and how lucky we are to be enriched by their diversity. Have we all gone insane?? How can we allow this to happen?? We are losing our country so quickly. When are we going to stand up to tyranny??</p>

<p>Wrong. Ashkenazim Jews and Semites Jews are not racially the same; Ashkenazim Jews for all intent and purposes are white.</p>
