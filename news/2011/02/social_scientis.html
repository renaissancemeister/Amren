	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Discrimination is always high on the agenda at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology&rsquo;s conference, where psychologists discuss their research on racial prejudice, homophobia, sexism, stereotype threat and unconscious bias against minorities. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Jonathan Haidt [pronounced <i>height</i>], a social psychologist at the University of Virginia who studies the intuitive foundations of morality and ideology {snip} polled his audience at the San Antonio Convention Center, starting by asking how many considered themselves politically liberal. A sea of hands appeared, and Dr. Haidt estimated that liberals made up 80 percent of the 1,000 psychologists in the ballroom. When he asked for centrists and libertarians, he spotted fewer than three dozen hands. And then, when he asked for conservatives, he counted a grand total of three. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is a statistically impossible lack of diversity,&#8221; Dr. Haidt concluded, noting polls showing that 40 percent of Americans are conservative and 20 percent are liberal. {snip}</p>

		<p>When it comes to systemic racism and institutional bias, any White person who has a job, unless they are LGTB, is proof that the time is right for more diversity seminars and sensitivity training sessions.</p>
<p>How to the top White elites get to keep their jobs? They must complain about the burden of white privilege and how they must do more to understand the painful past, that they must be nailed to the &#8220;cross of accountability&#8221; by giving blacks veto power over the budget.  Then, and only then, will the compromise be reached that lets Whites keep their top jobs.  But when it comes time to replace them, no Whites need apply.  </p>
<p>Everything is turning into third world chaos, as planned.  White achievement is a sign of bias.</p>
<p>Blacks no longer go to prison for raping White girls: her White skin is a symbol of unearned White privilege and the debt she owes, therefore, her White skin is &#8220;consent&#8221; to forced sex.</p>
<p>And since making White babies is a hate crime against humanity, robbing her of her Whites Only sex life helps cure the world of racism.<br>

		<p> I&rsquo;m shocked   &mdash;   SHOCKED!   &mdash;   that this refreshing and revealing article actually appeared in the New York Times. It violates so many sacred tenets of liberal orthodoxy that I rather suspect the writer, and the editor who approved the story, may face immediate dismissal.</p>
<p> All these points that Professor Haidt made so keenly and accurately are merely some of the things that conservatives and race realists (we&rsquo;re often one and the same, aren&rsquo;t we?) have been saying for years. So typical of the Left to want &#8220;diversity&#8221; in skin color, but most assuredly not in the philosophy by which a society is run.</p>
<p> Amazing, also, that these southpaw psychologists seemed to take Haidt&rsquo;s scolding in good part. Although there may have been jokes about lynching him later in the washroom.</p>

		<p>And, &#8216;by address&rsquo; I bet they are ten times as conservative as the rest of us.  Not least because they are _well paid_ to be so.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I have long suspected, &#8216;liberals&rsquo; are more herd followers than any conservative thinker.</p>
<p>Give them something to be easy-answer ashamed of and they will line up like iron filings to a magnet behind the opposed viewpoint.</p>
<p>And the sad part is that NONE of these people will stop to ask themselves: &#8220;Am I this easily polarized by the issue or by my standing in a &#8216;free thinking&rsquo; professional culture which rejects any other choice?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t ask that question, they will never get to Q#2: &#8220;Is my bias unduly influencing official policy by virtue of my stature as an &#8216;expert&rsquo; in the field of&hellip;bias?&#8221;</p>
<p>Which means they will never reach the final tier of self discovery by which they become suspicious of their own opinions sufficient to vet them by checking facts.  Like race based crime rate, social achievement indices, and the history of multiculturalism fragmenting societies into &#8216;bowlin alone&rsquo; genetic isolates, from Rome onwards.</p>
<p>This is ingrained, institutionalized, stupidity.  That a people who are supposedly so expert on the rationales of other people, know themselves so poorly that their own bigotry surprises them.</p>

		<p>I suppose the SPSP will have to engage in an affirmative action program to get more conservatives, moderates and libertarians to start worrying about racial prejudice, homophobia, sexism, stereotype threat and unconscious bias against minorities.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t have to work hard, though.  There were plenty of those to be found at last weekend&rsquo;s CPAC.</p>

		<p>This is not the first probe of this issue.  An example of the<br>
typical leftist &#8220;disconnect&#8221; from reality and tradition is the<br>
attitude of about 95% of mental &#8220;health&#8221; works re the work of<br>
Thomas Szasz, M.D.  The scientifically discredited notion of<br>
&#8220;Blank Slate&#8221; still has a firm pulse beat among a majority of<br>
mental &#8220;health&#8221; workers. Consider the now legally<br>
mandated question routinely made to all clients initially:<br>
&#8220;Do you have inclinations/thoughts/ of harming yourself or others?&#8221;  Obviously, the question has a quite different interpretative framework between sociobiiology,on the one hand, <br>
and conventional Blank Slate orthodoxies, on the other.  For psychology to get its wheels back on the rails, it has to become  a study of the study of human behavior.    </p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t expect the social sciences to willingly rectify the bias either. That would make them look bad. If they brought in conservative professors to balance the perspectives it would show how biased their research has been these past decades. I think it will take political action to force the universities to change. There are conservative state governments that could force change.</p>
<p>Just think of how much bad social policy has resulted from this bias in the social sciences. There&rsquo;s been so much phony science taught to students who became leaders. It has also severely handicapped conservatives in that ideas and arguments were never given the chance to develop in the universities.</p>

		<p>From the original New York Times article:</p>
<p> &#8220;Dr. [Jonathan] Haidt [UVA] argued that social psychologists are a &#8216;tribal-moral community&rsquo; united by &#8216;sacred values&rsquo; that hinder research and damage their credibility  &mdash;  and blind them to the hostile climate they&rsquo;ve created for non-liberals.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;The fields of psychology, sociology and anthropology have long attracted liberals, but they became more exclusive after the 1960s, according to Dr. Haidt. &#8216;The fight for civil rights and against racism became the sacred cause unifying the left throughout American society, and within the academy,&rsquo; he said, arguing that this shared morality both &#8216;binds and blinds.&rsquo;<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;If a group circles around sacred values, they will evolve into a tribal-moral community,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;They&rsquo;ll embrace science whenever it supports their sacred values, but they&rsquo;ll ditch it or distort it as soon as it threatens a sacred value.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s easy for social scientists to observe this process in other communities, like the fundamentalist Christians who embrace &#8216;intelligent design&rsquo; while rejecting Darwinism. But academics can be selective, too, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan found in 1965 when he warned about the rise of unmarried parenthood and welfare dependency among blacks  &mdash;  violating the taboo against criticizing victims of racism.<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Moynihan was shunned by many of his colleagues at Harvard as racist,&rsquo; Dr. Haidt said. &#8216;Open-minded inquiry into the problems of the black family was shut down for decades, precisely the decades in which it was most urgently needed. Only in the last few years have liberal sociologists begun to acknowledge that Moynihan was right all along.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>
<p>COMMENT: George Will had a solid column on the phenomenon of deeply embedded leftist bias in academic scholarship in 2004. But Will used different terminology.  Whereas Haidt speaks of a &#8220;tribal moral community&#8221; to describe the insular leftism of the social sciences, Will refers to &#8220;group polarization.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same phenomenon:</p>
<p>Academia, Stuck To the Left [highlights]<br>
GEORGE WILL<br>
Nov. 18, 2004<br>
New York Times</p>
<p>WHY ACADEMICS ALWAYS ASSUME THEY ARE IN THE COMPANY OF LIBERALS AT ACADEMIC GATHERINGS: LIBERALISM IS EMBEDDED IN &ldquo;RELEVANT&rdquo; SCHOLARSHIP:</p>
<p> &ldquo;&hellip;the &lsquo;first protocol&rsquo; of academic society is the &lsquo;common assumption&rsquo;   &mdash;   that, at professional gatherings, all the strangers in the room are liberals.  It is a reasonable assumption, given that in order to enter the profession, your work must be deemed, by the criteria of the prevailing culture, &lsquo;relevant.&rsquo; [Mark, professor of English at Emory] Bauerlein says various academic fields now have premises that embed political orientations in their very definitions of scholarship.&rdquo; </p>
<p>HOW POLITICAL ORIENTATION IS INGRAINED IN &ldquo;SCHOLARSHIP&rdquo;: Bauerlein: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Schools of education, for instance, take constructivist theories of learning as definitive, excluding realists (in matters of knowledge) on principle, while the quasi-Marxist outlook of cultural studies rules out those who espouse capitalism. If you disapprove of affirmative action, forget pursuing a degree in African American studies. If you think that the nuclear family proves the best unit of social well-being, stay away from women&rsquo;s studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;INSTITUTIONAL PROVINCIALISM&rdquo; PRODUCES THE &ldquo;FALSE CONSENSUS EFFECT,&rdquo; A BELIEF THAT ONE&rsquo;S VIEWS MATCH THAT OF THE LARGER SOCIETY: Bauerline:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&hellip;.people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population.&rsquo; There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls &lsquo;the law of group polarization.&rsquo; Bauerlein explains: &lsquo;When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs.&rsquo; They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MARGINALIZED ACADEMIA – WHILE PROFESSING A COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY – ARE ACTUALLY THE INTELLECTUAL EQUIVALENT OF ONE-PARTY NATIONS:</p>
<p>Academia &ldquo;is less listened to than it was. It has marginalized itself, partly by political shrillness and silliness that have something to do with the parochialism produced by what George Orwell called &lsquo;smelly little orthodoxies.&rsquo;  Many campuses are intellectual versions of one-party nations   &mdash;   except such nations usually have the merit, such as it is, of candor about their ideological monopolies. In contrast, American campuses have more insistently proclaimed their commitment to diversity as they have become more intellectually monochrome.  They do indeed cultivate diversity   &mdash;   in race, skin color, ethnicity, sexual preference. In everything but thought.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>This is fantastic! As a former soc. sci. major I always wanted to hear the jargon turned against the malicious practitioners of PC. And unlike so much of the discipline, this is most apt to the task. The level of completely naive bias shown by the conference attendees casts doubt on their ability to ever practice anything that might rightly be termed &#8220;science&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This is neither surprising nor alarming. A study of business executives, business owners, and military officers would find a preponderance of conservatives and libertarians.<br>

My only concern is that a liberal majority in the social sciences is likely to suppress studies into black social pathology and the importance of genetics in human affairs. </p>

		<p>Everybody knows that academia is filled with communists or collectivists. That has been the pattern in Communist/socialist countries since the beginning of time. That&rsquo;s where the ideology starts. Most conservatives are in the physical sciences(biology, physics, mathematics) rather than social sciences where Communists(aka &#8220;Liberals&#8221;)can spew their propaganda and brainwash or browbeat a captive audience. Also, I suspect that many of these psychologists in the ballroom were actually closet conservatives anyway.</p>

I said &#8220;we are now accepting as normal the idea that men could have their sex organs removed to become women&#8221;.His response was &#8220;well maybe those men felt like women inside and never really thought of themselves as men. So it is now acceptable for them to have a sex change&#8221;. My response to his answer was with another question.The question was &#8220;if I felt inside like Jesus,Caesar or Napoleon would you think it would be acceptable for me to believe I was one of those people&#8221;.The discussion went down hill after that.I&rsquo;m glad it was a casual conversation at my job.I am certainly satisfied I never went to see a psychologist on a professional level. After that conversation it now seems perfectly clear to me that some people in the psychiatric profession are pretty wacky themselves.</p>

		<p>What a great article. </p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>&#8220;A few even endorsed his call for a new affirmative-action goal: a membership that&rsquo;s 10 percent conservative by 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great, let&rsquo;s make affirmative action the exclusive social modality forever more! (Let&rsquo;s not).</p>
<p>Hey, I have an &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; program: how about scientists (even social &#8220;scientists&#8221;) actually adopting the attitude of science and always entertaining some doubt that their own ideas are irrefutably correct.</p>
<p>With that attitude, they wouldn&rsquo;t be so likely to shut out researchers who disagree with them.</p>
<p>Of course the problem is that almost no humans regard their favored ideas as being ideas, but instead regard them as plain truths as obvious as the nose on your face.</p>
<p>And no human is happier than the human who&rsquo;s found a comfortable group that shares his &#8220;plain truths&#8221; and will exclude others who don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s a trait that supports tribal cohesion and has been selected for by evolution, and so it appears we&rsquo;re stuck with it for at least another 50,000 years or so. </p>

		<p>About a similar amount of unanimity would probably have been found at a meeting of the Politburo of the former Soviet Union if the members had been asked who was a fervent believer in Communism. This is a good example of how we have a quasi-totalitarian system of societal and cultural control in the United States and the entire Western world which is leading those of European descent to a slow, but sure, racial genocide.</p>

		<p>Forget it. They will only say &#8220;reality has a liberal bias&#8221; and that the more intelligent you are the more naturally liberal you will be. Just like that fake list of presidential IQs that was floating around for awhile, where the libs scored highest.

		<p>Do a search of &#8220;cross of accountability + episcopal&#8221; and see how the Episcopal Church is using black history to replace Jesus. Now, instead of going to Jesus for forgiveness, the Episcopalians are going to their blacks &#8220;to be held accountable for our unearned White privileges.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good point, but you must differentiate between psychologists and psychiatrists, which are actually two separate disciplines.  Psychiatrists take a more medical approach to personal and social behavior and may (and do) prescribe often damaging drugs, believing in the chemical manipulation of the individual while psychologists cannot prescribe.  Psychologists tend to work more on the order of counseling and theorizing about social and personal problems, while psychiatrists seem to more often concern themselves with physical and chemical manipulation of behaviors.  But from my own experience you are right about both, they seem to be motivated by their own neurosis, just as with Freud.</p>

		<p>There isn&rsquo;t much science in &#8216;social science.&rsquo;  Science is just a word used by liberals to sound authoritative when espousing their views.  Liberals aren&rsquo;t really persuaded by factual observation.  </p>
<p>Liberals are really full of themselves and their main concern is how they feel good about themselves as they decry realsim which they mistake for racism.</p>

		<p>This should hardly be surprising.  The ludicrously named &#8220;social sciences&#8221; are devoted mainly to denying biological factors in the realm of human achievement.</p>
<p>Environment becomes all-important, genetics trivial.  Failure of certain groups is invariably attributed to historical and environmental factors, occasionally including childhood malnutrution.  </p>
<p>The social sciences, as practiced today, are an intellectual, social, and scientific farce.</p>

		<p>White Episcopal bishop in Mississippi fights against his own race realism by calling it racism- </p>
<p><br>
http://www.dioms.org/dfc/newsdetail_2/520</p>
<p>&#8220;But I also know that stain of racism that still infects my own heart and soul. I am not proud of certain thoughts and feelings that I find within me in unexpected moments. The acknowledgement and confession of those things done and left undone in both my present life and in my (our) past is critical to my healing.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
We wonder if he wipes out the &#8220;stain&#8221; by telling his White wife to not lock her car doors when she drives through downtown Jackson (very black and and dangerous) so that he can be healed of his race realism, which he calls racism?</p>

		<p>Another great reason for state governments to defund state universities.  Let the schools survive more on private funds and tuition.  This way, the market will decide which area of study is more important.</p>
<p>My prediction is that rich business execs (more likely to be conservative/libertarian) will donate millions to business schools, and social workers will donate dozens to liberal arts schools.  Without state funds, Marxist scholars will be more and more marganilized.</p>

		<p>When I was a Biology major in college I took a course in Sociology as an elective. I got an A in spite of the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out what it was all about. Ny professor, by the way, was gay and that was in the seventies. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now retired and work part-time in a sociology dept. At a presentation I had to attend one of these airheads said with a straight face that breast cancer may be caused by racism. I literally had to bite my tongue.       </p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&ldquo;INSTITUTIONAL PROVINCIALISM&rdquo; PRODUCES THE &ldquo;FALSE CONSENSUS EFFECT,&rdquo; A BELIEF THAT ONE&rsquo;S VIEWS MATCH THAT OF THE LARGER SOCIETY: Bauerline:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&hellip;.people think that the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population.&rsquo; There also is what Cass Sunstein, professor of political science and jurisprudence at the University of Chicago, calls &lsquo;the law of group polarization.&rsquo; Bauerlein explains: &lsquo;When like-minded people deliberate as an organized group, the general opinion shifts toward extreme versions of their common beliefs.&rsquo; They become tone-deaf to the way they sound to others outside their closed circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I know where &#8220;We&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; comes from.  Thanks AmRen!</p>

		<p>Not all psychologists are as daffy as you suggest.  Phil Rushton is sound, Chris Brand, Richard Lynn, Don Templer, Helmut Nyborg likewise.  &#8216;The Blank Slate&rsquo; is a good start, as is Plomin&rsquo;s work, or Moffitt and Caspi&rsquo;s.  Then there is, of course, Arthur Jensen, and Linda Gottfredson.  These thinkers may seek evidence for some of the more heartfelt positions taken by some contributors to this site, but since when has wanting sound evidence been a bad thing?</p>

		<p>#9 - E Puribus Pluribus, thank you for your additions and comments.</p>
<p>I would like to add that the original article references a book that I found enlightening and can recommend: &#8220;A Conflict of Visions&#8221; by Thomas Sowell. </p>
<p>I am also sending the link to the original article to my daughter, who is taking introductory psychology in college and who has to post links to psychology articles as part of her course requirements. Thanks, AmRen!</p>
