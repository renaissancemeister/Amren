			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon Otterman, New York Times, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New York State education officials released a new set of graduation statistics on Monday that show less than half of students in the state are leaving high school prepared for college and well-paying careers.</p>
<p>The new statistics, part of a push to realign state standards with college performance, show that only 23 percent of students in New York City graduated ready for college or careers in 2009, not counting special-education students. {snip}</p>
<p>But New York City is still doing better than the state&rsquo;s other large urban districts. In Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers, less than 17 percent of students met the proposed standards, including just 5 percent in Rochester.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Statewide, 77 percent of students graduate from high school. Currently, a student needs to score a 65 on four of the state&rsquo;s five required Regents exams to graduate, and beginning next year, they will need a 65 on all five.</p>

		<p>Judging from a story here on AR last week, I don&rsquo;t think the graduation rates are even that high.  That&rsquo;s because so many teachers are eking Regents exams up to barely passing scores of 65, when in reality, they probably failed and therefore should not have graduated.</p>

		<p>What is the problem here?</p>
<p>I can guess most are black?</p>
<p>Why not just give them their Affirmative Action Masters Degree around high school graduation day.</p>
<p>It will save the taxpayers some money, free up space in college for people who actually want to be there and the blacks gifted with degree&rsquo;s will still have the same IQ as if they had attended?</p>

		<p>I work in the school system.  Our students are 100% non-white.  A mix of black, mestizo latino and amerindian. </p>
<p>I am not kidding you when I tell you ALL of us teachers routinely give 2nd-3rd grade work to our HIGH SCHOOL students.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to do it.  Almost all of us are white and none of us are racist or hostile.  We want our charges to succeed.  We really do and we try as hard as humanly possible to raise everyone up.</p>
<p>The trouble is that over half the &#8216;students&rsquo; are so low skilled academically that they cannot really handle much at all.  </p>
<p>I have &#8216;students&rsquo; who, when you talk to them, they stare blankly at you.  I have students who, if you give them a question that requires more than three words to answer, they turn their heads and refuse to do that little work, preferring instead to sneak the Ipods or laugh with their friends rudely.  I have students who are nice and sweet but who have absolutely nothing going on upstairs.  </p>
<p>They are all &#8216;mainstreamed&rsquo; with the more competent students, and there are some non-white students who are quite smart, but because of the god-awful mix of ability levels, the pace in the class is slowed down.  </p>
<p>Some of my brighter students are also very unmotivated.  They could easily do the work, but they absolutely don&rsquo;t care.  They come to school to socialize, good around, get free lunch, pick up girls or because they expect a free ride.  My latino students - every other word out of their mouths is a cuss word in Spanish.  It just doesn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p><br>
When we have a moment to talk, which isn&rsquo;t very common, all us white teachers roll our eyes and trade quick horror stories of this or that student who flipped out in class and destroyed the lesson, or who was so brain-dead or unresponsive that it sapped our morale.</p>
<p>Forget about &#8216;superman&rsquo; coming to save these nineteen year old &#8216;kids.&rsquo;  The best we can do is give them elementary level work and say, &#8220;Here, see Shaquanda and Marisol are working.&#8221; All the reform in the world will not work as long as you keep importing the children of illiterate farmers who are teenagers with little formal schooling under their belt.</p>

		<p>When you consider the dung heaps the public schools have become, this cannot be any kind of surprise.  With the feds involved in public education, it has turned into brainwashing rather than education, and fails to prepare almost every student for further academic achievement.  And, as I see it, these kids who can&rsquo;t cut college are better off going to a vocationally-oriented post high school educational center, because a university education is no longer an education - it too is a blatant brainwashing by the far Left.  The marxists have indeed &#8220;buried&#8221; us - from within, by taking over when anyone who noticed and protested was branded as a filthy conservative.  We have already lost a generation of our youth - conservatives need to take this nation back on every level, send the leftists packing, and put us back on a positive path to prosperity.</p>

		<p>Oh this is funny.  I thought that blue state liberals wanted the world to think that it is only states like Alabama that have students performing badly. This here must mean that low test scores have to do with race more than with rural white people in the South who are conservative. Who would have thought?</p>

		<p>We see these stories time and time again in any number of states. They may not discuss race, but I think quite a few people know who they are talking about. When you take this article and the first article about white children becoming the minority in several states, one can only come to the logical conclusion that the USA is doomed. We are no longer great, nor will we be again.</p>

		<p>As a retired professor, I can attest to the fact that the a large number of students of all races are simply unprepared to do college work.</p>
<p>In fact, I read a Chronicle of Higher Education study that indicated that at some state universities the number of remedial courses taken by students surpasses 30% of their total college curriculum. This is sad.  </p>

		<p>It amazes me that anyone growing up today is interested in being a teacher. Those who have been teaching for a number of years are vested in it, and often have no choice. Applicants are on waiting lists for teaching in private schools in our area, as much as 4-5 years long. With the behavior of most children (and their parental units) I see in public, I would literally prostitute myself before being a teacher - it&rsquo;s no less dangerous, much less work, and much more lucrative.</p>

		<p><i>As a retired professor, I can attest to the fact that the a large number of students of all races are simply unprepared to do college work</i>.</p>
<p>Professor, if I may be so bold as to tweak your comment a bit to better reflect the reality I see as a high school teacher:</p>
<p>&hellip;a large number of students of all races are simply <b>incapable</b> of doing college work.</p>
<p>There are no preparations I can do to overcome an inherent low IQ, not to mention lack of drive, initiative and focus.</p>
<p>Yet, the government-run educational establishment continues to deny reality by insisting that IQ is irrelevant and that everyone is capable of understanding applied mathematics, theoretical physics or mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>College level work should be reserved for those with enough IQ points and the potential and desire to achieve, an elite number if you will, as it was before the egalitarian marxists marched through the institutions starting in the 60s, took over the highest level of management and enforced a mendacious PC Reign of Terror upon all levels of academia.</p>
<p>Until this lie is exposed for what it is, expect to see more students with IQs of 85, with full scholarships, enrolled in elite, higher-level institutions, while those White children with exceptional IQs, test scores and achievement levels are locked out.</p>
<p>You can ask me.  I am an expert in this field from hard experience.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Jay</p>
<p>You have pointed out one of the truly great evils foisted on the public schools in the last 40 years by egalitarian Marxists that control the educational system at the highest levels.   Mainstreaming is a travesty of the worst sort.  </p>
<p>Ask any teacher:  Classrooms are known by the lowest common denominator, the bright children do not &#8220;pull up&#8221; the losers, the &#8220;cream does not rise to the top;&#8221; (I despise that cliche, but I hear it all the time and I want you to know&hellip;) the losers drag down the kids with potential who give up in frustration and anger.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given this issue a lot of thought (and lived it as well in my professional life) and I believe the reason for mainstreaming near-retarded students in the same classroom as brighter children is to ensure that all children, especially White children, are kept down and dumb.  Easier to accept Big Brother and his lies that way.</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had violent kids stand in my doorway with an advocate and court order in hand allowing them to enter mainstreamed classrooms in the general population.  I&rsquo;ve had kids with IQs of ~ 60 mainstreamed into regular classrooms,  not capable of reading a single thing, let alone able to put their name at the top of a paper because they are illiterate as well.  The barely literate &#8220;aides&#8221; that are supposed to be with them every day either hide, are absent or are pulled out to act as security guards.</p>
<p>It is devastating to our bright White children to have to endure this. </p>
<p>It is clearly a violation of White Children&rsquo;s Civil Rights, if not outright Child Abuse.</p>

		<p>My world war two generation parents, who both came from poor backgrounds went through the New York City public school system when it was one of the best, if not the best system in the country.  Back then NOBODY made any excuses for poor academic achievement because they were both poor.  The bottom line, and I see it while attending college in the South, is that nonwhites, except for Asians, are not academically motivated, nor willing to put in the hard work necessary fro academic achievement.  Of course, we&rsquo; re not supposed to discuss this dirty little secret; nor the fact that liberalism ruined many institutions in this country, including the school systems.</p>

<p>Just some random questions:</p>
<p>How of this do you see as being due to inherent IQ?</p>
<p>What are some of the other factors? </p>
<p>How does the education establishment view the problem   &mdash;   both officially and when doors are closed?</p>

<p>I know someone who&rsquo;s a rookie teacher at a similar black &amp; hispanic school in Florida - she is ASTONISHED at how unintelligent her students are.  It&rsquo;s elementary school, so the students are still sweet and cooperative, but they are just too low-IQ to keep up with state standards.  </p>
<p>Her school has been labeled &#8220;failing&#8221; under No Child Left Behind, and she&rsquo;s in danger of losing her job.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a teacher work harder to reach kids - if pure effort would shove knowledge into their heads, she&rsquo;d be a miracle worker!  But they were all several grade-levels behind when she got them and she can&rsquo;t get them up to &#8220;proficient&#8221; on tests.  </p>
<p>In desperation, she recently decided to do the thing she said she&rsquo;d never do: game the system.  She&rsquo;s given up on the bottom third of the class, ignores the smartest couple kids, and concentrates on &#8220;teaching to the test&#8221; for the middle-ranked kids.  She even made a mathematical formula to help her <b>select the 14 kids</b> she&rsquo;s working on!  There is just no other way she can stay employed as a new teacher in Florida in this economy.  </p>

<p>And the result of mainstreaming these people, but mostly blacks, then carrying on with AA all through college, the elites have set loose a growing tribe of dangerous incompetents on the public, especially in the medical and pharmaceutical professions.</p>
<p>Case in point:  A black &#8220;pharmacist&#8221; filled a prescription for a man who had been assaulted during a robbery who had his jaw broken and wired shut.  She had on the label instructions to, &#8220;Gargle and swallow.&#8221;  Suspicious, the man made further inquiries and learned that the gargle solution had a warning from the manufacturer that said, &#8220;Warning, do not swallow!  May  cause vomiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he had followed the instructions given by the black &#8220;pharmacist&#8221; to swallow, more likely than not he would have choked to death on his own vomit.</p>
<p>Confronted with her incompetent label instructions by telephone, she became highly irritated and said to bring the bottle back in and she would change the label.  This story is the absolute truth.</p>
<p>Case in point:  I buy insulin for a little pet with diabetes.  I wanted to know how long the sustance could be stored without being tainted and, therefore, ineffective.</p>
<p>The black male pharmacist said 28 days, then throw the rest away.  It cost $115 per refill.</p>
<p>I asked if he could give me the name of the manufacture.  (It was Aventis.)  He tried to read the company name from one of the bottles he had on hand, but couldn&rsquo;t pronounce &#8220;Aventis,&#8221; in fact he got only as far as Ave  &mdash;    &mdash;  er  &mdash;    &mdash;  Ave  &mdash;  -er  &mdash;    &mdash;  then he began talking about how liquid antibiotics break down fast, as if that had anything to do with my inquiry on insulin.</p>
<p>I found the company on the internet, phoned them and was told Aventis only guarantees the insulin for 28 days, but with proper refrigeration it can be effective for as long as a year, which to me means I&rsquo;m paying $115 every three months, instead of monthly.</p>
<p>How about one more?  My sister had a prescription filled at a drugstore, this time with a black female technician, who just makes labels for the scripts as they come in.  She wrote 3 refills for a script that clearly authorized 5 refills.</p>
<p>Confronting her with the discrepancy resulted in her phoning the doctor&rsquo;s office to verify the refill amount was 5 and not 3, raising red flags at the doctor&rsquo;s office as to a possible change by the customer of the refills on the script, because just calling the office over a script now days raises suspicions.</p>
<p>Should I go on?  I have some other stories about black nurses and black doctors, but I think I&rsquo;ve made my point.</p>
<p>While blacks in the field don&rsquo;t screw up EVERY prescription, all it takes is one to kill somebody.  All of us are at risk of being poisoned or killed by black incompetents set loose on our society by elites whose pupose for doing so is strictly to conform to the political dictates of diversity at all costs.</p>
<p>If you happen to suffer because of it and you are of the leftist variety, you deserve what you will eventually get.  If you are an aware white person:  BEWARE!  Protect yourself against these people and their supporters at all costs.  It WILL get worse.<br>

		<p>I am a resident of New York and attended one of the state university there. I majored in history with a minor in Russian and East European studies. There were plenty of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians on our campus, but there were almost none in my classes. The only time I saw many Asian students in any classes were in the History of China and History of Japan courses that I took as electives. There were maybe one or two Asians in my European and American history classes. Strangely, the Asians seemed to lack intellectual curiosity about Western history. On the other hand, about 1/3 to 1/2 of the students in the Asian history courses were White, and we tended to participate far more than the Asians (though perhaps language issues explain that). On an amusing note, while the whites selected seats randomly about the lecture hall, the Asian students sat in clusters based on ethnicity or geography-Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China&hellip;.and seemed not to interact at all. It was the Sino-Japanese War all over again!<br>
In the case of Blacks and Hispanics, I always saw them passing me in the Student Union or on my way to lecture, but I have no idea what they did all day. I imagine Afrocentric or Hispanic Labor &#8216;studies&rsquo; or some other mickey mouse classes. <br>
I forgot to add that this was in the 1990s.<br>

		<p>There are a lot of great observations here.</p>
<p>Those of us in the trenches really live in a bizarro world where logic is upside down and 2 + 2 = 5.</p>
<p>In a meeting today with the other teachers (to discuss the dismal results on a school wide research skills initiative) one of the young, liberal 24 year old teachers lamented that he &#8216;over estimated&rsquo; what the students could do and that he was surprised that his results were particularly horrible.</p>
<p>I just chuckled inside.  He gave the kind of paper assignment that we used to get in fourth grade, and our eleventh graders could not handle it - so over 50% just copied straight from wikipedia - not even trying to hide it!  Of the rest, well another 40% refused to do the assignment.  Oh well, we can&rsquo;t fail them because then the &#8220;DATA&#8221; would show we are horrible teachers and we would lose our jobs!  (10% did sort of okay, but mostly substandard.)</p>
<p>It is so funny watching our young, liberal teachers sitting around talking about &#8216;authentic assessments&rsquo; and &#8216;follow the rubrics&rsquo; when they fully intend to give 2nd to 3rd grade level work and pretend that it is the same level of work they received when they were high school students.  And oh do they ever love to praise the students for every little grammatically incorrect sentence they write!</p>
<p>I said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again until someone listens - all the reports you hear about student gains, higher test scores, schools being turned around or charter schools as miracle solutions - all that &#8220;Data&#8221; is manipulated and fraudulant to give a false picture.  (I have tons of first hand experiences and know a huge number of others who have seen this time and again.)</p>
<p>The teachers will either fudge their grades and test scores or be fired.  What would you do if you needed a job?  </p>
<p>The administrators will change grades outright and give ghost credits to raise graduation rates.  This happens every day  What would you do if you needed a job, and there was no way you could authentically get little Shamindelicious or Pablo to really, truly care about their studies? </p>
<p>Putting data on our heads only forces people to make a devil&rsquo;s bargain.  I stay out of it as best I can, but most of my colleagues have gone over to the dark side - to save their paychecks because there are no more jobs for white teachers out there if you&rsquo;re over 28 years old.</p>

		<p>Retired Prof,I have always opposed remedial studies in college. When I was earning my degree at a state college in GA, I had 2 friends (both white females) who took such classes. One could not pass them even after getting an extra FOURTH chance to do so in the summer; in other words, her freshman yr. was mostly devoted to such classes and she still flunked out. She was later diagnosed with a learning disability. The other friend did ok after 2 quarters of remedial classes but flunked out after 1 quarter of &#8220;real&#8221; classes.</p>
<p>I knew 2 other students who took such classes and ended up dropping or flunking out. One was also a white female, one a black female. My family and another college friend thought I was unfair to oppose remedial work in college, never mind the fact that everyone I knew who took it clearly could not handle even that or real classes after that. Those who called me unfair said that no one should be punished for attending a lousy high school. Maybe the problem was within the students, not their high schools, but if the latter were the problem, the solution is to improve high schools. Remedial work and college/university should not even be uttered in the same sentence. Do you think European and Asian schools allow such nonsense?</p>

		<p>#12 Bon  both exceptional posts. I&rsquo;ve said for years that not everyone is college material. Your comments about IQ as as well as having a desire to achieve are spot on. Additionally, those who have the intellect but no idea what they want to do with their lives yet - and there are plenty, and no shame in it - who flounder around in general studies for several years aren&rsquo;t who should be filling the seats. College is voluntary and there is no age limit. One can return to schooling at any time. Many people never need a college degree to do what they end up doing most of their lives. Many more people would benefit by going from high school to vocational schools and learn a trade if they learn anything at all. At least it would prevent some impressionable fools for being indoctrinated by perverted, liberal college professors.</p>

		<p>&#8220;College level work should be reserved for those with enough IQ points and the potential and desire to achieve, an elite number if you will, as it was before the egalitarian marxists marched through the institutions starting in the 60s, took over the highest level of management and enforced a mendacious PC Reign of Terror upon all levels of academia.&#8221; Bon</p>
<p> Yes, all you said is God&rsquo;s truth. I&rsquo;ve seen Herbert Marcuse&rsquo;s sixties radicals become the tweed jacket wearing, PC professors of today&rsquo;s left-wing dumbed down academia. College is not for everyone, and yet we have opened it for all abilities with disastrous results. </p>

		<p>My heart breaks for the &#8220;gifted and talented&#8221; students who are being taught by affirmative action teachers, who have no idea how to foster creativity and no idea how to help students who are clearly smarter than they are. There usually is racial animosity directed to the student worsens the situation. A lot of teachers (as one poster mentioned) think that the g/t students will &#8220;be okay&#8221;, ignore the lower part of the class, and teach to the middle. </p>
<p>Remember, people: g/t kids ARE gifted and talented. Their revenge knows no bounds. </p>
