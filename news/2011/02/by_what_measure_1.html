<h1>By What Measurement Can We Abolish the Diversity Department?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Visconti, Ask the White Guy (Diversity Inc.), February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>QUESTION: </p>
<p>How will we know that these &#8220;democratizing&#8221; efforts have been successful? Once success has been achieved (that is, when it is the norm that opportunity is truly equal), does the need for a &#8220;diversity management department&#8221; go away? </p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>This is an easy question to answer: If you believe all people are created equally, then we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re done with needing a diversity department to help with equitable access and talent development by measuring the results. {snip}</p>
<p>Aside from gender, I can give you endless examples of disproportionate representation of white men in positions of power in this country to the detriment of anyone not Christian, and/or heterosexual, and/or non-white (or white Hispanic), and/or people with ADA-defined disabilities, etc.</p>
<p>By the way, the United States leads the world in human and civil rights; we&rsquo;re the best when you look at the entire picture. When you get outside of this country, the discrimination increases and you can see this by measuring the representation of the majority culture in positions of power in every other region I can think of (for example, how many non-Han Chinese people are in positions of power in China? I&rsquo;d imagine there may be a few, but I&rsquo;ve never seen one).</p>
<p>Even in the distant future when companies are equitably recruited, talent development is equally effective and positions of power are equitably staffed, there will still be a need for a diversity department. {snip}</p>
<p>On a national basis, whether you are a Keynesian or Supply-Side economist, the one constant that grows economies is innovation. Our society cannot achieve maximum innovation if broad sectors of its population are sidelined. We shortchange our own GDP by being discriminatory.</p>
<p>{snip} I am quite sure nobody alive today will live to see equity, even in workforce measures  &mdash;  but we can take deep satisfaction of continuing that work and seeing our incremental growth as a society.<br>

<p>At least he admits what many obscure or avoid:  they&rsquo;re not concerned with equal opportunity, they&rsquo;re only interested in equal results.</p>
<p>He also essentially admits the basis of this attitude:  It is assumed that all people are created equal.  When this belief falls, the rest of the house of cards tumbles.</p>

		<p>Why is it mainly only Western countries that are pressured to bow down to diversity? People. the world over want a homeland; home to their unique language and culture. Demographics say that for over 300 years on this North American continent, the demographics have remained stable (85-90% whites of European descent, the remaining 10-15% split bet. blacks and Native Americans) yet the elites keep repeating that we have always been a diverse scoiety. Within 30-40 years, that 85-90% has rapidly declined to 55-60%! That fits the UN definition of ethnic genocide!!     </p>

<p>Every line of this piece carries assumptions that cannot  be questioned in polite society, but this one in particular jumps out at me. It&rsquo;s a corruption of the original quote, which is<i> &#8220;All men are created equal,&#8221;</i>  it was made by a slave holder who also believed that all races could not co-exist in the same society and who certainly believed that the races differed in intelligence and ability, it is not a scientific pronouncement, it is not part of our constitution, and it merely refers to the idea that all races have certain rights, such as the right to be free. Need I go on?</p>

<p>Yeah and what country right now is going into decline and what country is rising to power, Mr. Visconti?</p>
<p>Also lack of equality of outcome doesn&rsquo;t equate to lack of equality of possibility. It is possible to to have unequal results based upon fully possible attempts.</p>
<p>I recommend a course in logic.</p>

		<p>3 Tim in Indiana:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re particularly religious, so I might be walking on eggshells here.</p>
<p>Have you ever read the King James Bible, or at least parts of it?</p>
<p>If you notice, on occasion, you will read an italicized word within the text of the verses.  Most of those words are prepositions.  Some of them are verb tenses, and sometimes they are several word phrases.  The point of those words and phrases being in italics is that they were not part of the original KJV Bible.  They were later added in order to clarify the context of the verses for the &#8220;modern&#8221; (in relative terms) reader, because the English language changed since the early seventeenth century.  In other words, the message that you get by reading the KJV verse here in year 2011 that happens to have the additional words printed in italics is exactly the message a person in the early 17th century would have gotten by reading the original version without the extra words.</p>
<p>Several days ago, a blog post a V-Dare suggested that we should do something similar with the Declaration of Independence, especially the clause you reference.  Here is in its original text:</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
<p>The person proposed that we add the preposition &#8220;in&#8221; after &#8220;equal&#8221; and before &#8220;that.&#8221;  So if we make it like the modern day KJVB, it would look like this:</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, <i>in</i> that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
<p>The addition of that single word is crucial.  And, like in the KJVB, it brings the substance, the meaning back to what the authors of the phrase really meant.  Makes a lot more sense, doesn&rsquo;t it?  Thomas Jefferson et al. did not literally believe in racial equality.  They believe in equality &#8220;in that&#8221; they deserved to have certain rights, not belief that every human being of every race had equal abilities such that there should be a Federal investigation for every black man or woman who doesn&rsquo;t become a doctor or rocket scientist.  </p>
<p>The addition of &#8220;in&#8221; brings that sentence in the DoI back to its true intended context.</p>

		<p>Be suspicious. Be very suspicious of these words &#8220;Diversity&#8221;. &#8220;Equality&#8221;, &#8220;Human Economics&#8221; &#8220;Justice&#8221; and especially &#8220;Social Justice&#8221;. They  are always code words of the Far Left aka<br>
International Marxism.<br>
&#8220;Equality&#8221; means a way to assault American success built on real<br>
achievement<br>
&#8220;Social Justice&#8221; means not rule of law, but rule of agenda with<br>
the laws and especially the Constitution shoved out of the way<br>
&#8220;Diversity&#8221; means open borders, Third World Invasion, White Europeans relativized and removed from power.</p>

		<p><i>If you believe all people are created equally, then we&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re done with needing a diversity department to help with equitable access and talent development by measuring the results.</i></p>
<p>This guy has given me plenty of material to work with.</p>
<p>1 Created? Created by whom? Is he acknowledging the religious foundation of our nation?</p>
<p>2 If people were not &#8220;created equally&#8221; by a deity then his proposition is irrelevant. Is there, therefore, any evidence to support so much as a &#8220;creation&#8221; whether it be equal or otherwise? If not then he has no evidence to support the assumption on which his answer is based.</p>
<p>3 If it is indeed his contention that &#8220;all people are created equally&#8221; then race is the least of his worries. He should be at least as concerned that homeless vagrants are not teaching nuclear physics at MIT. After all, if they were both created equally then the homeless vagrant must have been discriminated against. Otherwise, he would be a professor of nuclear physics as well.</p>
<p>4 Oh, wait. I think I know where he is going with this line of reasoning. He would like to &#8220;give to each according to their needs and take from each according to their ability.&#8221; And since he wishes to do it on a racial level I suggest that he is nothing more than a &#8220;racial marxist&#8221; using allegations of discrimination as a pretext to support his socialist agenda.</p>
<p>5 And, lastly, who does he think should be in charge of this &#8220;diversity management department&#8221;? Why HIM, of course!</p>

		<p>Of course &#8220;all men are created equal.&#8221;  That is to say, all men have the same rights  &mdash;  regardless of age, status, race, religion, ethnicity, etc.</p>
<p>But to take this argument and assert all men have the same abilities  &mdash;  well that&rsquo;s plain stupid.  The NBA is 85% black because, well blacks are normally better at basketball.  The fact some other races (i.e. whites and some Asians) do better at scholarly pursuits is just as obvious.</p>

<p>The Diversity Department is never going to end. In fact it will get more demanding.</p>
<p>When affirmative action first started in the 1960&rsquo;s we were told it was a temporary remedy to make up for past discrimination.</p>
<p>Now illegal immigrants are jumping on the bandwagon. </p>

		<p>@Question Diversity - I believe you are correct. Furthermore, if one actually reads the Bible, you will see that it certainly preaches separation of the races. Afterall, since God made them different, doesnt He expect them to remain so?<br>
But the point that will cause the most contention I believe, is to whom was Mr Jefferson referring? Like everything else in the constitution and attendant writings, it is referring to, and written for, ONE group of people. It is for and about the founders and THEIR posterity, as is plainly stated. I do not believe Mr Jefferson, nor any other of the framers, had blacks, yellows, reds, etc in mind when this/these statements were made or penned. </p>

		<p>Buffalonative is right. We cannot all be the same (equal) and still be diverse too. The diversitarians are promoting a specious ideology that contains a fundamental contradiction in logic. Hence, it can never work;  it will always be at odds with itself.</p>
