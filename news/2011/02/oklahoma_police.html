			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick Manning, FoxNews, February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Tulsa Police Deptartment is investigating a captain who refused an order to assign officers to attend an upcoming Islamic event because he said it would violate his religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Capt. Paul Fields was reassigned after he refused to order officers under his command to attend the Islamic Center of Tulsa&rsquo;s Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a spokesman for the department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my opinion and that of my legal counsel that forcing me to enter a Mosque when it is not directly related to a police call for service is a violation of my Civil Rights,&#8221; Fields wrote in an internal police department memo obtained by Fox News.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no problem with officers attending on a voluntary basis; however, I take exception to requiring officers to attend this event,&#8221; Fields wrote in an e-mail to his superior officer obtained by Fox News. &#8220;I believe this directive to be an unlawful order, as it is in direct conflict with my personal religious convictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, according to a promotional flyer, the Islamic event included not just food and entertainment, but &#8220;presentations&#8221; on &#8220;beliefs, human rights, and women.&#8221; They would also be able to watch a Muslim prayer service and take a tour of the mosque.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ibrahim Hooper, the spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called the incident an example of &#8220;anti-Muslim bigotry.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When somebody feels empowered to say &#8216;I&rsquo;m not going to take part in a community outreach event at a mosque because I basically don&rsquo;t like Muslims,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all part of that rise in Islamophobia in our society,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear this officer say he refused the event because he hated Muslims, he said that it violated his religious beliefs as a Christian man. If the religions had been reversed there would have been no problem with his refusal. The Tulsa mosque is full of radicals- including one man who arranged marriages for Middle Eastern men who were at the end of a visa. They were matched with convert American women who could give them green cards.</p>

Why should any American do what a Muslim tells him to do?</p>
<p>Most sailors in the middle east are greater than muhammad because they never actually had to deal with the people there.</p>
<p>But if one sailor looks at a covered mosque, a muslim will want to kill him.</p>
<p>This a the kind of terroristic double standard Captain Fields is referring to.</p>

		<p>The police have to protect their professional authority in public.  </p>
<p>Attendance at these types of events need to be carefully considered.  The last thing the police want is to be used as a prop, obeying the summons of the Imam, finding themselves seated at the lower end of the table in a subservient position to the senior cleric. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the wiliness of these people. Everything is a game of one-upmanship in their propaganda jihad.  </p>

<p>Sorry Mr. Policeman, I am assuming you are white and therefore you have no civil rights.  White people only have human rights, but that will also diminish soon enough.</p>
<p>Everyone here knows that the ADL would be all over the Tulsa police if the department ordered the cops to attend a Catholic ceremony.  </p>
<p>So now not going to a forced retreat where they will probably try to brainwash you is Islamophobia?  This why white people mainly do not like minorities.  You cannot tell them no, they cry racism or some other -ism.  So white peoples&rsquo; response is to not associate with you entirely.  Also, good job of putting words into the officer&rsquo;s mouth Mr. Hooper.</p>
<p>The last snippet in the article is already enough to sue for defamation of character and libel (since it is printed) in a fair and sane world.  But SUE SUE SUE anyways.  Fight fire with fire.  Pretend to cry on the stand, claim emotional damages, etc., etc.</p>

		<p>Surely if a request to attend such an event would be in an officer&rsquo;s own time, he simply says &#8216;no thanks&rsquo;. However, if this is an official order, in paid time, then officers would wear full uniform which includes footwear. If no footwear is worn then the officer is not fully dressed as not in full official uniform, therefore cannot officially attend. If an emergency call-out were to happen, then the mere thought of a bunch of officers struggling to don footwear to attend would be akin to keystone cops. This is just another islamic scam to cause maximum mayhem in non-muslim communities and should be acknowledged and exposed as such.   </p>

		<p>Christians and others can be forced from now until eternity to &#8220;socialize&#8221; with Muslims, but it will not make the religions compatible. To Muslims, their religion is also their law and their political belief and they will not be content until it overpowers this country. I foresee the day when the Middle East is vacated while its people spread all over the world bringing Sharia law with them and forcing it on other countries and people. I just heard a guest on Fox and Friends declare that just because the young Saudi was caught here in Texas with plans to make a weapon of mass destruction, that it shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason to stop immigration from those countries. On the contrary, I can&rsquo;t think of a better one!</p>

		<p>Many liberals interpret the separation of church and state to mean the abolishment of Christianity from public view. They object to Christmas carols and prayers at school, and they object to the Ten Commandments being displayed in a courthouse. Oddly, these same liberals are very quiet when it comes to the separation of mosque and state.   </p>

		<p>I have also heard and read about U.S. Armed Forces personel being persecuted for refusing to attend Christian Evangelical services and concerts.  This is an unacceptable violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Requiring Capt Paul Fields of the Tulsa Police Department, and the officers serving under him, to attend this event at the mosque, or any other event at a church, a synagogue, or any other house of worship is also unacceptable violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives all of us the right either choose which religion we want to practice and even the right to not have any religion at all!</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson must be spinning in his grave!  </p>
<p>But I just remembered, the Muslims believe they must kill or convert all &#8220;infidels&#8221;, like myself and everyone else reading this post!</p>

		<p>OK, I&rsquo;m going to take a different approach on this one than most people here. This was a &#8220;Law Enforcement APPRECIATION Day&#8221; that the mosque was having. That isn&rsquo;t a negative thing. The cops should help promote this. </p>
<p>I understand that it was against his religion to attend, but the department should have QUIETLY sent someone else in his place. Why this made it into the media, I haven&rsquo;t a clue. </p>

I&rsquo;m sure the &#8220;quite solution&#8221; would have been the preferred method of choice if the situation were reversed and a muslim cop objected to attending a &#8220;law enforcement appreciation&#8221; day at a Christian church on the grounds it violated his religious beliefs.</p>
<p>However, since it was a White Christian whose religious beliefs were offended, the bullhorn approach, or public scorn method was deemed more appropriate. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you decide why that is&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Oh come on Jim,,, a Muslim &#8220;appreciating&#8221; law enforcement?!? Not hardly. This stunt had the exact effect/result as intended. Even so, the officer was and is absolutely correct in refusing to attend. Such would lend credibility to them, as well as be highly offensive to the attending officers whilst violating their rights. <br>
But why don&rsquo;t we ever accuse Muslims of &#8220;Christianophobia&#8221;?</p>

		<p>A word of caution: It may have been called a &#8220;Law enforcement appreciation day&#8221;, but it isn&rsquo;t clear what the exact motives behind it are.</p>
<p>Sharia Law is often held up to be greater than infidel laws. According to Muslim theocratic custom,  &#8220;there is no authority greater than Allah&#8221;. Muslims often ask guidance from their mosque when confronted with a choice between obeying Western laws and acting according to their cultural norms.</p>
<p>Having the police stand beside the Imam could be interpreted as a stamp of approval for everything the Imam says.  It could also be a warning not to speak to the police, because anything said against the Muslim community will get back to the Imam.</p>

First of all Muslims will say anything or espouse anything that will serve as a ruse to further their agenda. Lying to the infidel is encouraged by the Qur&rsquo;an. Anyone who wishes to survive must not be deceived by outward appearances.  They are the masters of deceit.<br>

		<p>#1 It is becoming difficult as a strong, loyal American to continue to stomach this transformation of our country.  My first response, as a retired serviceman, is to say and do what I cannot put in print here, or anywhere.  We are in what aviators call a flat spin, an ever increasingly dangerous, out of control spiral towards death.  Death of everything we knew or expected for the future.  Soon, very soon, many of us will face a point of no return, a point beyond which action should have been taken. Many men who swore an oath to uphold the constitution will face that decision point of go-no go.  Some will say despite the oath, they must put their family first or they may just give in to the demands of this &#8220;hope and change&#8221; or they may decide that being too young, there is too much more life to live.  That is why this administration has proclaimed it necessary to wait for many of our age to die for they know there will never be any amount of money or trinkets or soothing words to close our eyes to our oath.  Yet we are getting older, those of us that proudly remembered our parents, The Greatest Generation, and what they did for us.  Hell, the shame alone of them watching us from their perch in Heaven should be enough to make up our minds.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he weighs in on this matter as well.  He has no concept of anything beyond the &#8220;local&#8221; level, that&rsquo;s why he constantly demeans his office by getting involved in local squabbles in immature attempts at self aggrandizement.  Wait for him to declare that this police captain has &#8220;acted stupidly&#8221; in the near future.</p>
<p>I am being slightly tangential, but has anyone noticed not only the extreme narcissism of Obama, but the complete inability to understand both the viewpoints of anyone other than of his race?  His instant response to the Henry Louis Gates episode was that the cops had acted stupidly  &mdash;  I assumed that it was akin to &#8220;Why, everyone knows what the great Dr. Gates looks like, obviously these guys knew that they were hassling a brilliant scholar simply because they are racist.&#8221;  I probably would have recognized Gates on the doorstep of his university provided house  &mdash;  simply because his &#8220;scholarship&#8221; is required reading in my area of literature, and unlike most white critics, he plasters a picture of himself on the front of anything printed for him by the compliant vanity press he has a contract with.  Who else would, though, especially a campus cop?  I am exaggerating to make a point, but can you imagine one of Thomas Pynchon&rsquo;s close friends exclaiming, &#8220;my god, they arrested Tom  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t the stupid cops know who he is?&#8221;  Of course not, and no one outside of a certain subset of academia would know what the idiotic Skippy Gates looks like as well.</p>
<p>Sorry for ranting, I did get off on a tangent.  Muslims, as do non whites, have no concept of anything beyond their own limited worldview and mindset.  No ability or even attempt to understand that someone outside their cultural, social, political or religious framework could possibly think differently and not accept their beliefs as truisms.  Therefore, anyone who disagrees is being willfully evil, rejecting the &#8220;truth&#8221; deliberately and maliciously.  That is one simple reason for their hatred of us and anything we stand for.</p>

<p>Excellent point! You are absolutely right about that. </p>
<p>But I should point out that this happens all the time with Christian, black, and Jewish clergy,  to whom the police must grovel without a whimper. </p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to stop getting the police involved in religious matters. Let them stick to crime, and keep out of &#8220;community relations&#8221;.</p>

<p>That statement alone tells us how far this society is degenerated into a squabbling mass of tribes, each one trying to gain power and position over the others and all of them wanting to destroy the white power structure in this country, and they&rsquo;ve been wildly successful in their endeavors, thanks to the white gullible fools who are their useful idiots.</p>
<p>I just read where the community organizer took time out from his black dominated dances in the evening to sign on to accepting about 80,000 more African refugees, even though true unemployment is about 17% and falling.</p>
<p>Forget about bringing this country back from the brink.  It&rsquo;s much too late.  For those who want to stay, the remote areas of states like Idaho will be viable communities to turn to, and probably safe havens for many more years.  They would not only offer a chance at constructing parallel communities, but being out and away from the deterioation taking place, especially in the big urban areas, they should be unaffected by any civil conflict that occurs.</p>
<p>The entire globe could be embroiled in mass fighting; food and resource shortages, as well as water, yet the leftis crazies  continue to encourage unchecked births among the third world hordes, and when they cannot find enough food for them they&rsquo;re encouraged to come here where our own resources are rapidly dwindling.</p>

		<p>White Raven said &#8220;but being out and away from the deterioation taking place, especially in the big urban areas, they should be unaffected by any civil conflict that occurs&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this safety would last less than a year, NO safety or isolation is going to work without the residents of said safe areas being willing to kill to stay that way. I have seen men die in combat because they couldn&rsquo;t pull the trigger, believe this! &#8220;urban&#8221; pillagers (we know what urban means, right!) will have no such problems pulling triggers and to them, your life is worth EXACTLY what you have.<br>

		<p>To any number of posters above that support attending or participating in ANYTHING to do with supporting islam&hellip;.STFU! make no mistake, muslims don&rsquo;t do ANYTHING for appreciation of ANYTHING Western, they are sneaky until they have the numbers to NOT BE SNEAKY any longer. One muslim wants a monque, 2 muslims want to build a mosque, 3 muslims will DEMAND a mosque, 4 muslims will DEMAND WE BUILD THEIR MOSQUE and FINANCE IT! more than 5 or more and the muslims start BLOWING STUFF UP. No exceptions. As soon as the muslim numbers grow to where they feel confident to challenge local authorities and laws THEY WILL DO SO and our politicians, fearing being called racisssssss will surrender!</p>

		<p>Our ancestors  &mdash;  Quaker, Anglican, or Calvinist  &mdash;  would not have liked this much. But this is the challenge of our generation  &mdash;  dealing with an expansion of the kinds of beliefs that can be incorporated into American civic  life. Police officers are public servants, and must anticipate that they will be asked to take the lead in showing acceptance to what was previously foreign. I sympathize with Captain Fields, but he is just a bit too stuck on himself (just like the average AmRen reader). Face it dudes  &mdash;  Jefferson would cringe at what we are today, but we are still able to stick together.</p>

		<p>How could he be in trouble for refusing to order officers to attend a  political event, that is illegal in most places. Islam is not a religion it is a political belief system that is in no way compatible with Western civilizations or beliefs.</p>

		<p>I could have believed this in Vermont,but Oklahoma!.This really is a sinister and dangerous escalation.There was a similar incident in Scotland a couple of years ago,when firemen were dismissed for refusing to attend a gay pride march through Glasgow.Maybe they got the idea from there.</p>

		<p>Had this been an undercover assignment that would be one thing but right here in our own country where many people are forced by law to take down AMERICAN flags, in a country where we can&rsquo;t express or own religious thoughts&hellip; No Christmas Trees, No Manger Scenes, these are RELIGIOUS holidays BUT if they were celebrating The Religion Of Peace (No Problem Go Ahead) something is wrong, very wrong, now not having all the details I might not even have a right to forming an opinion BUT it seems as if something is very wrong in the land of the free today?</p>

		<p>Perhaps, on reflection, the police captain might have made a strong point by sending only female police officers to the event, given the misogynist attitudes of the mosque.</p>

		<p>For years we have been listening to the ACLU whine about the separation of church and state,  this is clear cut and in your face violation of that very item yet the ACLU is nowhere to be found. This proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the ACLU is nothing but a bunch of &#8220;hypocrites&#8221;. As long as it is &#8220;anti-American&#8221; and &#8220;anti-Christian&#8221; there is no reason for them to be concerned whatsoever. </p>

		<p>Hold your breath and dance on one leg waiting for the ACLU, the press, and the rest of the usual suspects to scream &#8220;SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE!&#8221; the way they do when any opportunity to thwart Christians or Christianity via the mythical &#8220;separation of Church and State&#8221; presents itself.</p>
