<h1><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/02/15/redskins-albert-haynesworth-accused-sexual-abuse/">Redskins&rsquo; Albert Haynesworth Accused of Sexual Abuse</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, February 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Albert Haynesworth has been linked to another off-field accusation of misbehavior, this time by a waitress who claims the Washington Redskins defensive lineman sexually abused her at a restaurant, a claim his agent denied.</p>
<p>Chad Speck found himself in familiar territory in defending his client after WRC-TV reported that, according to a police report, the waitress said Haynesworth touched her breast while paying his bill early Sunday at a downtown Washington hotel.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Negative reports on Haynesworth&rsquo;s behavior have become so common that even teammate Phillip Daniels tweeted the latest news and added: &#8220;Man does it ever end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haynesworth&rsquo;s troubles come both on and off the field, from his disputes over playing time and conditioning with coach Mike Shanahan to his mounting legal issues. At one point last summer he was juggling as many four court-related matters, including lawsuits from a bank, an exotic dancer, a man injured in an automobile accident, and complaints from his ex-wife that he wasn&rsquo;t paying her health insurance or their children&rsquo;s bills.</p>
<p>More came in 2011. On Jan. 4, he was ticketed for going 64 mph in a 45 mph zone in Fairfax County, Va. Earlier this month, in the same county, he was accused of road rage by a man who claimed he was tailgated and then assaulted by Haynesworth.</p>
<p>On Saturday, some 24 hours before the hotel complaint, Haynesworth appeared at a police station and was formally charged with misdemeanor assault in the road rage investigation. He is scheduled to appear in court on March 31 on that charge.</p>
<p>Speck said Haynesworth is innocent and that the accuser in that case is seeking fame and money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The former two-time All-Pro Haynesworth got in constant trouble with Shanahan, skipping offseason workouts and failing to pass a conditioning test at the start of training camp. Haynesworth, 29, did not start a game this season, despite being in the second year of a seven-year, $100 million contract.</p>

		<p>White Americans can stop this at any time, by simply refusing to subsidize football. Turn off the TV. Don&rsquo;t attend the games. Don&rsquo;t buy the sportswear. Everything else is pointless complaining.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost like there is some sort of conspiracy to put incompetent blacks into professional sports, just as they shove them into jobs and workplaces and government.</p>
<p>And then they excuse it all with &#8220;white man can&rsquo;t jump/run&#8221; and &#8220;blacks have black athleticism&#8221; </p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s built like a tank.  I have to wonder how much untraceable steroids are a part of &#8216;preseason conditioning&rsquo; and how that may effect his mind.</p>
<p>OTOH, I frankly _do not care what his problems are_.  Because this is the real crime-</p>

<p>For pities sake, how can we teach OUR youth the value of being honest, hard working and seekers of intelligence and moral worth across a lifetime of moderation and self discipline, with a slap in the face of &#8216;you are what you do&rsquo; lifestyle ethics like that?</p>

		<p>Haynesworth is a typically self-centered and amoral black man. The man refuses to show up for practice or in shape in spite of a $100 million contract!<br>

<p>My brother follows football a lot more than I do and says every time Haynesworth&rsquo;s name comes up on talk radio black men call in to defend him. I guess they share his values. </p>

		<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one iota if Haynesworth is eventually shot and killed following an argument of some kind, over money, women or drugs. He&rsquo;s a high profile fatality-in-waiting.</p>

		<p>Haynesworth is not stupid (I.Q. less than 90) or he would not be a defensive lineman, but he is extremely irresponsible. He is unable to use his intelligence to foresee the probable outcomes of his actions, or he does not have the self discipline to act responsibly. Consider if you could earn $100M, and after taxes,expenses, and agent fees keep about $50M. Would you foolishly jeopardize earning this fortune?  </p>

		<p>During the time of slavery, black men were routinely pitted against each other in fights, much as some black men now pit dogs and bet on them.  The bettors didn&rsquo;t give a hoot about the fighters&rsquo; morals  &mdash;  in fact they were likely assumed not to have any.  If ears got bitten off, a la Mike Tyson, no one cared as long as the fighter lived to fight another day.  I often think that a lot of white football fans have the same outlook regarding black players today.  The former doesn&rsquo;t hold the latter to the same standards of conduct to which they themselves would be held.</p>

		<p>#9- Is there any documentation to establish that &#8220;black men were routinely pitted against each other in fights&#8221; by slave owners? Healthy male slaves were very valuable; it would be very unprofitable to risk injuring them. I cite <i>Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Slavery</i> by  Stanley L. Engerman &amp; Robert William Fogel. </p>

		<p>9 Old White Lady:</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing that.  Black slaves were too expensive an investment for their owners to &#8220;pit&#8221; against each other willy-nilly.  Especially the kinds of strong men that would fight each other.  The version I buy is that black men would inevitably fight each other as a natural consequence of existing, (nothing new under the sun, n&rsquo;est pas?), and various whites on the plantation, when they sensed a fight among several blacks might be coming based on heated words or heated disputes (e.g. over a woman or a possession or money or some valuable object), placed bets on who would win the inevitable fight.</p>
