			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, San Francisco Chronicle, January 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the past two years, the couple have navigated some of life&rsquo;s rites of passage with this in mind. She does the driving and often pays because even with a college degree it&rsquo;s hard for [her boyfriend, who is an illegal from Mexico] to find work.</p>
<p>The death of the Dream Act last month dashed many immigrants&rsquo; hopes of a path to citizenship. While illegal immigrant students pushed for the bill to improve their access to education and jobs after graduation, the legislation also would have eased the often-overlooked challenges of making friends and dating without papers.</p>
<p>On college campuses, illegal immigrant students face a social barrier anywhere photo identification like a driver&rsquo;s license is required: from taking a road trip with friends to bar hopping to catching a flight.</p>
<p>That can make it difficult to deepen friendships or relationships  &mdash;  or to date at all.</p>
<p>Nancy Guarneros, a 23-year-old graduate student, remembers how she was primping for a special night out with her boyfriend when he told her they were going to a club. She panicked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s like, oh my gosh, how can you take me somewhere that requires government ID? What were you thinking?&#8221; Guarneros recalled at a recent meeting students held in Los Angeles to talk about so-called &#8220;cross-status&#8221; dating.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t clear how many young couples are in similar relationships. Researchers say it would be tough to find out, but the number has probably grown since children brought here as illegal immigrants after the country&rsquo;s 1986 legalization program have come of age and it has become tougher to get a green card through marriage.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. citizens and green card holders date illegal immigrants at all ages, but researchers say it&rsquo;s probably more frequent on college campuses, which foster diversity and create a space where students feel safer revealing their status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially likely for those students and people in their 20s who were brought here as toddlers and grew up on American cartoons, speak flawless English and have American friends.</p>
<p>Many never knew they were illegal immigrants until they learned at age 16, unlike their peers, they couldn&rsquo;t get a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Issues like dating and friendships may seem trivial  &mdash;  but not to teens and college students yearning to fit in.</p>
<p>Illegal immigrant youth often become angry and depressed when they learn they&rsquo;re living in a country not truly their own and can&rsquo;t find work, said Carola Suarez-Orozco, professor of applied psychology and co-director of Immigration Studies at New York University.</p>
<p>And while getting an education and a job top their worries, students say they also struggle to have a normal social life.</p>
<p>Dating isn&rsquo;t easy, especially for young men who can&rsquo;t drive and often don&rsquo;t have cash to pay for a date since they can&rsquo;t get a steady job.</p>
<p>The students are also viewed with suspicion by the families of their U.S. boyfriends and girlfriends who think they&rsquo;re after a green card.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In my last relationship, she actually told me her mom told her, &#8216;Mija,&rsquo; be careful because you know those people, they only want one thing,&#8221; he told the students at the meeting, to a chorus of chuckles.</p>
<p>For those who date illegal immigrants, there&rsquo;s a constant worry their partners will get deported. They find themselves making excuses as to why the couple can&rsquo;t meet friends at a bar or travel.</p>
<p>Both are often consumed by guilt: citizens, for the privileges they have; illegal immigrants for the burdens they shoulder.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s before they graduate from college. The pressures only get harder when they leave the safety of campus.</p>
<p>Marriage was once seen as a surefire ticket to a green card. But many illegal immigrants now need to return to their birth countries to apply for papers and will be barred from returning for a decade unless they get a special waiver.</p>

		<p>Gee, my heart bleeds for these folks.  NOT.  They all probably got tuition assistance due to affirmative action to attend their colleges.  Tuition assistance which rightfully belonged to AMERICANS.  Blacks are finally starting to catch on, too.  Took them a while since most have 12 year old brains, but they ARE beginning to see that hispanics are taking federal funds THEY believe belong only to them.  Of course, the usual black reaction to any &#8220;injustice&#8221; is appearing - and it&rsquo;s not writing to their congressman or Obama.  It&rsquo;s pack attacking hispanics on the street.  It&rsquo;s truly amazing how the bleeding heart liberals who own the media in all forms think we should actually care about illegal alien dating problems.  Almost funny.  ALL aspects of life in the US should be unfriendly or difficult for those who are here illegally.  </p>

		<p>Ohs no ya&rsquo;ll! Little Nancy can&rsquo;t go to the club because her boyfriend doesn&rsquo;t have an ID! What EVER shall we do?! Why, I&rsquo;m sure the leftist loony that wrote this article thinks amnesty for him would go a long way in healing her pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Sheesh! Gimme a break! The only thing more amusing than this article are the comments. It&rsquo;s CLEAR how the folk in SF feel about this and I&rsquo;m loving it.</p>

		<p>This has to be one of the most shallow, self serving articles I have ever read.  Boo freakin hoo. I&rsquo;m supposed to care because some parasite can&rsquo;t go clubbing due to a lack of id?  Frankly I am pleased they can&rsquo;t drive- let them take the bus and savor the diversity.  </p>

<i>&#8220;That can make it difficult to deepen friendships or relationships &mdash; or to date at all.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Really? Being illegal is a barrier to dating?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t clear how many young couples are in similar relationships. Researchers say it would be tough to find out&#8221;</i></p>
<p>That it isn&rsquo;t clear means this likely this isn&rsquo;t a problem at all; just another excuse to push the Dream Act agenda. Maybe someone needs to apply for a government grant to study this non-existent problem.</p>

		<p>One finds it difficult to believe that street wise illegal aliens can not obtain fake IDs.</p>
<p>Also assuredly many of these illegals play the race card in the dating game <i>&#8216;I&rsquo;m sure your not a racist, so you will dance with me, right?&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>One of the nice things about Racialism is how simple and effective it is.  If someone doesn&rsquo;t look like me, they do not belong here at all and need to high tail it out.  All non-sense about paper-work becomes moot next to the importance of Race.  </p>

		<p>Dating illegal aliens is aiding and abetting the dispossession and then displacement of white Americans, not to mention black Americans. Why shouldn&rsquo;t the families of those stupid enough to date an illegal alien be hostile and suspicious towards them, regardless of race?</p>

		<p>Ever since the left really made an all-out push to pass the DREAM act last year, we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of stories about these illegal kids brought here illegally by their illegal parents, who are now entering adulthood and facing all sorts of weird problems.</p>
<p>The not so subtle subtext to all these stories is &#8220;gee, look how messed up our laws are making these unfortunate kids suffer.&#8221; Apparently, the authors of these articles don&rsquo;t think enough of their readers to ask them think things through.</p>
<p>For example, the blame for the plight of these kids falls most squarely on the shoulders of their parents. Period.</p>
<p>Want to feel bad for them? Want someone to blame? The parents deserve the lion&rsquo;s share of the blame. Just think about the parent who brings their child here illegally, forcing them to grow up and enter adulthood living in the shadows in a country they don&rsquo;t belong. What kind of parent is that?</p>
<p>If you want to find more places to lay blame, then lay blame on our federal government that has refused to enforce this country&rsquo;s immigration-related laws. The fed govt has created an atmosphere of anarchy and lawlessness that has been a green light for potential immigrants to take a chance on coming to this country illegally.</p>
<p>Now, we can turn toward these parents and the fed govt and say &#8220;look at what you have caused.&#8221; These young illegals are the result of their bad decisions, not the fault of this country&rsquo;s laws or of the majority who has never wanted them or their parents here.</p>
<p>Long story short - don&rsquo;t let these sob stories dissuade you or break your resolve. Life SHOULD be hard for people who are here illegally. Make it increasingly difficult and they will be more likely to go home.</p>

		<p>The illegals who brought their children here should tell them early on, &#8220;We, your parents, broke into this country, and you will be the one to pay for our criminal actions. Don&rsquo;t expect to get a job unless you present false documents, give fake names or false/stolen IDs. We&rsquo;ve done this to you so you have only us to  blame for having to perpetuate a life of crime.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Mexicans actually do not have a problem in the dating department.</p>
<p>Mexican&rsquo;s get around.</p>
<p>One time, during a port visit in Indonesia, A Mexican sailor had only been in the country for 2 hours but was already walking hand-in-hand with an Australian sheila who was already scuffing her flip flops all ready for sex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a Mexican to join the Navy already married then have a few kids before meeting another woman and divorcing a few years later.<br>

		<p>I amazed about how much immigrants &#8220;love&#8221; those who are native citizens in a country they live in.</p>
<p>It reminds me of my uncles wife, who was a Russian immigrant that came here with her boyfriend, and dumped him after 15 years just so that she could gain citizenship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t for all people but &#8220;love&#8221; becomes a tricky issue.</p>
<p>Maybe they should date in Mexico?</p>

<p>I left the greater SF Bay region in 2002 after a number of terrible experiences that began in 1994 when my professional office was broken into, burglarized, ransacked, vandalized (apologies to the original, honorable Vandal tribe), and otherwise destroyed.  I occasionally return to visit a couple friends.  Every time, I have noticed more and more brown faces and less white ones.  My visit last year shocked me, it&rsquo;s a virtual brown out, with more Asians mixed in.  The few white women I saw when I was out to dinner with friends were with Asian men.  Must be the money.</p>

		<p>The media just love to push these kind of stories. Why is it that such articles never are sent to the recipient journalistic spike. They regard it as a human interest story rather than as the hard political news it really is. </p>
