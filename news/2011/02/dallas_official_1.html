			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rudolph Bush, Dallas News, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway handed Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick a key to the city of Dallas on Saturday, he was really opening the lock to another controversy at City Hall.</p>
<p>What the key meant to Vick  &mdash;  who admitted brutalizing and killing dogs for entertainment and served 19 months in prison  &mdash;  is hard to say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gesture, and the outcry that ensued, led to a quick call from Mayor Tom Leppert that the city review how council members hand out ceremonial gifts, with the clear suggestion that guidelines become more restrictive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The key that Caraway gave Vick  &mdash;  a gold-hued, six-inch key bearing the seal of Dallas  &mdash;  is less than official, according to explanations from city officials.</p>
<p>The official &#8220;keys&#8221; to Dallas are made from gold or crystal and are given out mainly to foreign dignitaries under strict protocol.</p>
<p>But all council members are permitted to hand out token keys, at a cost of $25 apiece, to whomever they please. So it was that Kiss&rsquo; Gene Simmons got an unofficial key from council member Steve Salazar last week.</p>
<p>The way council members pass out unofficial keys sometimes raises hackles at City Hall, in large part because they so often seem to end up in the hands of celebrities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Caraway insisted, however, that Vick deserved the honor he received because he has, in Caraway&rsquo;s eyes, turned his life around and dedicated himself to keeping kids from making the same mistakes he did.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Council member Delia Jasso, a strong advocate for decent treatment of animals, said she didn&rsquo;t know enough to say whether Caraway&rsquo;s action was appropriate. But she did say that she believes Vick has made strides in convincing some animal advocates that he is serious about reform.</p>

		<p>I was fearing the content of the article and the tone of its comments were controversial because of a childish Cowboys-Eagles rivalry. I&rsquo;m glad this isn&rsquo;t the case for the article and isn&rsquo;t generally the case so far with the comments.</p>
<p>On another note, I find it interesting how Vick supporters wonder what he has to do to gain acceptance in the eyes of dog lovers.  There are many stories of a white person saying words that were a little too un-PC for the powers that be lost a job because of it, the vast majority of which were comparatively very innocuous compared to Vick&rsquo;s actual physical violence against dogs.  What would somebody who drew the ire of the anti-racist crowd have to do to gain their acceptance?  </p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t even have to see this politician&rsquo;s picture or read his name to know he&rsquo;s black.  Only a black would be so <i>belligerently</i> amoral and celebrity-worshiping.  They have no sense of community standards.</p>
<p>Here is part of a comment posted in favor of Michael Vick on the original article:  <i>&#8220;Think about something that you have done or something that you are doing and you have never been caught doing it. Think about it!&#8221;</i>  I have seen that &#8220;argument&#8221; made by blacks hundreds of times in defense of criminals, and it never fails to astound me.  I see it as a uniquely black argument.  </p>
<p>Blacks honestly believe it&rsquo;s common to commit horrible crimes like the worst black criminals, except most people &#8220;don&rsquo;t get caught&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve seen this argument made for gang rapists!!  Blacks who <i>don&rsquo;t</i> do these horrible things seem to think it&rsquo;s perfectly natural to <i>want to</i>, like we&rsquo;re all dog torturers or rapists without the opportunity.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve NEVER seen a white person make that argument for a psychopath - I&rsquo;ve NEVER seen a white person defend horrifying actions of a criminal by saying &#8220;you know you all want to do it too!&#8221;  <br>

		<p>How about giving awards to people who don&rsquo;t screw up theirs and others&rsquo; lives in the first place; NOT doing things that would require &#8216;turning your life around&rsquo;? Now THAT would be worthy. It would be much more appropriate to give Vick a key to Detroit or Washington D.C.</p>

		<p>Some may be surprised to learn that Farrakhan has received the key to the city from no fewer than 7 cities. And those are just the ones that I know.</p>
<p>Detroit, MI Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick<br>
Memphis, TN Mayor Willie Herenton<br>
Gary, IN Mayor Scott King<br>
Durham, NC Mayor Bill Bell<br>
Greensboro, NC State Rep. Earl Jones<br>
Compton,CA Mayor Walter Tucker</p>
<p>And last but not least&hellip;</p>
<p>Charlotte, NC </p>
<p><br>
I fully expect that one day Washington DC will give Malvo &amp; Mohammed &#8220;keys&#8221; for their fine marksmanship.</p>

		<p>Giving Vick &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; isnt a choice. It is an ABSOLUTE NECESSITY. Black Culture for its very existence demands<br>
that all standards, all accountability be erased. Once the idea<br>
of rigid, unyielding standards enter the black world..everything<br>
will collapse. Understand that..everything inexplicable about<br>
black behaviour..reelecting Marion Barry, cheering Michael Vick<br>
forgiving Charlie Rangel, exonerating OJ..all of it has nothing<br>
to do with reason, or truth or choice. It has to do with survival.</p>

		<p>And here is a prime example of the distinct difference between whites and blacks. White people do not give a pass to someone simply because they&rsquo;re the same skin color, as blacks do. To be able to do what Vick did makes him a psychopath. I don&rsquo;t care how well he plays football - he&rsquo;s still a psychopath. Nineteen months in prison doesn&rsquo;t seem like nearly enough when you see the pictures of what he did to those poor dogs. And when I heard he had kids, well, I hope they don&rsquo;t wind up looking like those dogs. </p>
<p>White people aren&rsquo;t surprised at what Caraway did. We&rsquo;ve become used to hearing from the friends and families of black criminals that &#8220;they are good boys!&#8221; or &#8220;they were just starting to turn their life around!&#8221; after they&rsquo;ve committed some horrible crime. Blacks are the most morally bankrupt people on this planet. Very few are ever truly remorseful for even the most heinous rapes or murders - another big difference between us and them. Just look at what they do to any area they take over. Detroit for example. The differences between white and black people go way beyond just skin color - as white liberal enablers keep spouting, hoping we&rsquo;re all too stupid to see the truth right in front of our faces.</p>

		<p>Forget the black convicted felon jailbirds like Vick. Bros got bros backs don&rsquo;t you know. That&rsquo;s universal when it comes to whitey. We all know evil racist bigot white supremacists like Jared Taylor are much more harmful and dangerous to progressive American society than someone like Black Chicago cult Muslim Farrakhan or La Raza cult. Somebody or something has turned America and the world upside down on its head trying to pretend everything is back to normal. We know who it is.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that radicals and their media brothers who stop all non-PC intelligent whites from congregating remain strangely silent and forgiving about Farrakhan Muslims who routinely travel hundreds of nights a year to all cities in America without any problem with their hotel accommodations white liberal white Marxist students shake their hands and kiss up to blacks? </p>
<p>Thankfully the Founding Fathers didnt have to worry about this when they met in summer 1776.  But my, haven&rsquo;t things changed for the worst. And don&rsquo;t worry. It can only get worse if you can believe that. That&rsquo;s why &#8220;they&#8221; were so scared of this plus the T Party aka third party. Republican Lincolnites are still the same as in 1860 when they selected their 1st president that started all this mess. Trent Lott got the date wrong. </p>

		<p>The underlying reason that black folks praise Vick is because they see him as a victim of the Western white-founded society&rsquo;s judicial system, which had no right to convict or incarcerate him because he&rsquo;s black.  Instead, it should be prosecuted for it&rsquo;s past crimes against non-whites. </p>

<p>Who let the dogs out, who, who, who?!</p>
<p>This is what to expect with black mayors, just as Eric Holder is what we had to expect with a black president, along with wise Latinas, females in charge of Home Security, Secretary of State, etc.  This country is a joke and its fall is made certain by this gaggle of self-serving incompetents.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t think of anyone more vile than Michael Vick except for Heidi Bierich.</p>
<p>It took a FOIA order to pry the following out of the government:</p>
<p><i>A confidential informant told investigators Vick drowned dogs, shot others to death and killed &#8216;them with a shovel.&rsquo; Vick was also accused of getting an &#8216;adrenaline high while killing the dogs.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Vick is a psychopath.  Period.</p>

		<p> Just because this thug is a winning quarterback we should forget his bestial cruelty toward animals? I&rsquo;ve seen far less forgiveness of people who made &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo; comments than I have for Michael Vick&rsquo;s vicious animal sadism. Let&rsquo;s not forget he tortured these  animals for his own personal amusement.<br>
Maybe he is geniunely sorry for his actions, or maybe he is sorry that he was caught?</p>
