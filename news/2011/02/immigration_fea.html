			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Doyle, Daily Mail (London), Feb. 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fears over immigration have increased among young people  &mdash;  amid dire jobs news for their age group. </p>
<p>More than 70 per cent of those in their late teens and early 20s now say immigration is a problem, according to pollsters Ipsos MORI. </p>
<p>That figure has risen by 10 per cent over the 12 months that saw unemployment among the young approach one million. </p>
<p>For the first time, people in the 16-24 age group are now more worried about migrant numbers than those in their 30s, the poll showed.</p>
<p>Last week it was revealed 965,000 young people are out of work and hundreds of thousands have never worked. One in five 16-24 year-olds is jobless and looking for work. </p>
<p>The poll found almost half of youngsters believe immigration into Britain will damage the economic recovery by taking jobs away from those already here. </p>
<p>Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, said: &#8216;The research shows strong support for tougher immigration policies, and high levels of concern. </p>
<p>&#8216;Concern among young people about immigration has also increased and that could be attributed to the high levels of youth unemployment.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Across the country, three quarters of Britons say immigration is a problem. Almost two thirds  &mdash;  65 per cent  &mdash;  want tougher controls on those coming into the country. </p>
<p>More than half (57 per cent) support the Government&rsquo;s immigration cap on non-EU migrant workers, and just 15 per cent are opposed.</p>
<p>Some 68 per cent of 25-39 year-olds said immigration was a big problem, compared to three quarters of those aged 40-64 and 86 per cent of those aged 65 and over. </p>
<p>The poll of more than 1,000 Britons revealed varying reasons for concerns. More than four out of ten people were worried about the burden on public services.</p>
<p>Nearly one in three highlighted job fears and a quarter pointed to a general failure in recent years to control migrant numbers. </p>
<p>Last week ministers laid out details of the new cap on non-EU workers, which comes into force from April 6. It will restrict to 21,700 the number allowed in each year. </p>
<p>Ministers hope the changes, with a clampdown on bogus students, will help cut net migration levels from more than 200,000-a-year now to &#8216;tens of thousands&rsquo; by 2015.</p>

		<p>This is <b>exactly</b> what I as a young man, have always answered to anybody older who said: &#8220;Whites will not wake up&#8221;</p>
<p>The leading generation is a hippie generation. When they grew up all threats were coming from whites and none-whites were a poor and small minority. Today most of them live in secure homes, go to expensive restaurants and drive with the car to their friends.</p>
<p>But the younger generation can&rsquo;t do that.<br>
Here in Germany the younger generation has to go to school with none-whites, they want to go out late at night and go to their friends and do all the things Teenagers normally do. And everywhere there are none-white immigrants stealing, shouting and threatening them. I have seen only a few days ago how a group of immigrants shouted and threatened two blond guys with their blond girlfriends.</p>
<p>The mainstream media, the society, the school systems, the teacher, the whole propaganda machine can do whatever they want! White children exactly know who is the problem and which people are dangerous to them when they go out at night. And the few whites who don&rsquo;t know actually are learning it next time they want to go out with their beautiful blond girlfriend.<br>
I personally don&rsquo;t know any German who is between 15 and 20 years and doesn&rsquo;t exactly know that browns and blacks are enormously more dangerous than whites and Asians. </p>
<p>It is just a matter of time.<br>
The younger white generation in Germany is more and more taking the power of the old hippies and use it.</p>

		<p>My fears for these young Britons is that they are more concerned with jobs than they are with their displacment, and replacement in their own country. Not to mention their culture and way of life is slowly being wiped away. But who knows&hellip;. maybe they are concerned with these things and are afraid to say it, but I have a sinking feeling about the whole mess. The mesures they plan to take to clamp down on immigration is too little, too late and painfully laughable.</p>

		<p>DON&rsquo;T get excited. Anti-immigration sentiment is NOT the same as anti-immigrant sentiment because it only crops up during tough recessions and then goes away during recovery, it isn&rsquo;t grounded in the common sense of ethno-cultural self-preservation but pure &amp; simple greed for money, the cryptonite of Western Man </p>

<p>Behind all the protests today as Egypt, Tunisia and Libya fall is the unspoken declaration for the, Youth of the World Unite!</p>
<p>Unemployment among those 18-26 is 50% or close to it in most countries, and the educated ones are learning their degrees are worthless and the others can&rsquo;t find jobs either.</p>
<p>While the weenies here in the US are too intimidated to let out even a squeak, the youth in Spain, Italy, Greece and even the  brow beaten, brainwashed youths in the UK and France, are beginning to take to the streets to protest the huge inequities of societies where the gated community crowds earn most all the money, while each country has a &#8220;stimulus&#8221; program to bail out their bad decisions at the expense of those on the bottom who pay the taxes. And many were bailed out by Bernanke to the tune of TRILLIONS of dollars in order to keep the international banksters from losing money.</p>
<p>As in the US the bailouts go to the fat cat banks, while the common man suffers the brunt of the global economic crash.</p>
<p>It is resulting in world-wide rebellion.  We will see much, much more of it in the next two years.</p>
<p>Youths of the world unite!  You have to. The oldsters are too intimidated and lazy to move an inch even if their lives depended on it.  The ones in this country won&rsquo;t even get up off the couch.</p>

		<p>Same problem here in the States.  There are so many cheap, under-the-table latinos in every town, large or small, that it&rsquo;s almost impossible in some areas for a young american (white or black) to get a job.  I already assume that when my kids are teenagers they will be unable to find ANY entry level employment.  I&rsquo;m taking steps to create an entry level job just for my kids, because at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re toast over here too.</p>

		<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s prognosticate a bit, shall we.  Let&rsquo;s project 5, 10, 20, 50 years down the road.  If it&rsquo;s bad now what is it going to be like then?  It seems to me that Whites around the world are in a bad state of denial of the facts and the reality of our situation in our own countries.  Britain and France are probably the two best, or maybe I should say the two worst examples of the perils of unchecked immigration.  These two countries will have real problems, I mean real violence, before others do, most likely.  The native-born White people are literally going to be fighting for their very lives in the near future.  All the non-White races are in White countries to take, NOT to give.  They want everything we&rsquo;ve created to be their own.  This is slow conquest.  It is time all White people everywhere awoke and joined forces to combat our planned destruction.</p>

		<p>I am glad to see that at least the younger Britons are waking up.  But I&rsquo;m sure that they&rsquo;ve all been sufficiently indoctrinated to prevent them from joining the one party that will do something about the immigration mess - the BNP.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here in the USA we still import 160,000 legal immigrants every month, despite unemployment over 10%.</p>

<p>Highduke, you are DEAD ON!  If the economy was the way it used to be, even most conservative whites would probably not care.  The real test is to see if they do something to change it(by voting BNP).  </p>
<p>The U.S. is no different.  How many know people who flip flop every few years between Dems and Reps?  They pick one, realize it was a bad choice, then next election pick the other party, etc.  REAL change comes from neither(party) people!  And both have a horrible track record with immigration.</p>

<p>They want to cut it to &#8216;tens of thousands&rsquo;??? This was forced on the British people by corrupt bureaucrats and radicals with an agenda. There&rsquo;s no reason not to toss them out on their ear.</p>

Perhaps, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a gigantic leap in logic to go from anti-immigration to anti-immigrant. <br>
The ball only needs to start getting rolling.</p>
<p>People before never talked about ending immigration because it was viewed as &#8220;impossible&#8221; or economically &#8220;foolish.&#8221;  And of course immigrant repatriation was even more out of the question.</p>
<p>But now we are in a situation where people are beginning to  become openly anti-immigration and questioning multiculturalism in general. With this kind of momentum it won&rsquo;t take long for people to drift into racial consciousness. </p>
<p>Our enemies stormed to power via incrementalism. It might be useful for us to consider it in order to take it back.</p>

		<p>Considering the British youth just recently rejected the BNP in an economy that hasn&rsquo;t really changed, I&rsquo;d say that this anti-immigration trend is just a fad that will go away when the economy starts to recover. When there&rsquo;s a huge demand to ban minarets, then you can breath a sigh of relief.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s about time a new generation of Europeans (England really IS part of Europe, friends) are coming to realize the worst enemy to Europe is immigration. We absolutely have to spread the word, to support those raising their voices in protest to immigration from third-worlders. Our future generations depend on it.</p>
<p>If we do not act. Do not speak out, we Whites will ultimately become prisoners in what were once our own lands. Don&rsquo;t believe it? You will when it&rsquo;s too late! When Non-Whites dictate to you and require you to obey laws framed and enforced BY THEM!</p>

		<p>German, I was very encouraged to read that your generation is aware of the threat.  We and our kids listen mostly to German/Swedish/Finnish Industrial/Folk Metal/Aggrotech groups, and your post confirmed what we perceived as a rising group awareness among white youth in Germany and Scandinavia.</p>
<p>While I truly fear for your safety, and hope that abuse by nonwhites will not break your spirit, your post gave me hope that, at least in Germany, the awakening may not come too late.</p>

		<p>The trend that younger people support nationalist policies more than older people has been going on in Europe for many years now.  A lot of the growth in vote share by nationalist parties is probably largely due to younger voters gaining the right to vote.  The young men who are in secondary school now will vote for nationalist parties at a higher rate than any other age group when they are able.  The problem is that two generations of below replacement birthrates means that young Europeans are outnumbered by brain dead middle aged types.  </p>

		<p>Remember in Great Britain they also have their form of Affirmative Action called &#8216;Affirmative Discrimination&rsquo; (Orwell would have loved that!)</p>
<p>The younger British generation trying to get into schools is going to be dis-proportionately effected by this as well as they compete with immigrants for spots.  </p>

		<p>I agree with German 100 percent.The hippie generation who ushered in this open society frame of mind now shelter themselves with their money.I&rsquo;ll bet most white ex-hippies will admit they were brainwashed by liberal,freelove propaganda when they were young.Consider advice from a person born and raised among 30-35percent black population.The white youth should stick together and defend themselves from the ignorant element of black youth.White girls who dont have &#8220;junglefever&#8221; are pressured by black males who accuse them of racism if they wont  &#8220;give up the bootay&#8221;.This can be stopped.If the parents train them on how to react and the young white males stand with them,MOST black males will move on to someone weaker.Dont let your friends get swept away by these con-artists.Finally,as the white youth gets older and,hopefully,finds shelter from these ignorants,stay involved in your childrens social lives!Teach from your experiences with black people and pass that along to the next generation.The blacks wont like it but theyll learn their place.After all,they,of all people,know who the ignorant race is&hellip;..they have mirrors.</p>
