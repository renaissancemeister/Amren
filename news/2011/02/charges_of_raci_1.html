			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lara Brenckle, Patriot-News (Harrisburg), February 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harrisburg&rsquo;s superintendent search is down to two candidates, both with deep roots in Pennsylvania education.</p>
<p>But almost as soon as Eric Holmes, acting superintendent of York City Schools, and Samuel DePaul, superintendent of Stanly County Schools in North Carolina, were announced as finalists, accusations of racism and political gamesmanship began to swirl.</p>
<p>One board member accused another of playing &#8220;plantation politics&#8221; with the futures of Harrisburg&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Amid it all is the still-potent push to retain Sybil Knight-Burney, Harrisburg&rsquo;s acting superintendent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Board member Lola Lawson, an opponent of the search process from the beginning, said Friday&rsquo;s announcement was further confirmation other board members, especially board President Roy Christ [who is white], completely disregarded the will of the people.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Christ] is acting like he&rsquo;s the great plantation master, come to save the little darkies,&#8221; Lawson said. &#8220;The arrogance of him to say &#8216;I know what&rsquo;s better for you than you know for yourself.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Christ not taking part in the selection process, Lawson accused him of orchestrating things from behind the scenes and using the superintendent search to position himself and others for higher office. &#8220;He&rsquo;s part of the problem,&#8221; Lawson said. &#8220;He&rsquo;s trying to position himself on the backs of a minority district.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawson continues to advocate hiring an independent search firm to locate the best and brightest, people with experience turning around troubled districts and making real progress with minority students.</p>
<p>Failing that, Lawson supports retaining Knight-Burney, saying that she&rsquo;s repeatedly shown her dedication to inner-city children and their education.</p>

		<p>Apart from a few tangential issues relating to the executive office of the Harrisburg Schools, will any of these candidates really make a difference?  Or, to ask it another way, does it really matter who gets the job?  AFAIC, pick a name out of the hat, and they&rsquo;ll do as well as any other name you can pick out of a hat.  It really doesn&rsquo;t matter that much who the superintendent is, what matters is the composition of the student body, and their interest in education.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the St. Louis City Public Schools experienced a rapid turnover in superintendents   &mdash;   There were, including interims, IIRC, four in seven years.  Local education activists were worried that this &#8220;instability&#8221; at the top of the SLPS would affect the education of children.  My reaction in my own mind at the time   &mdash;   Does the fact that the district has had 4 sups in 7 yrs make it any harder for a 2nd grade teacher to teach the multiplication tables or for his or her students to learn them?  Do 4 sups in 7 years mean that the Roman Empire didn&rsquo;t fall in 476 anymore such that history teachers can&rsquo;t teach it and high school students can&rsquo;t learn it?</p>

		<p>If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d let them put in the black who they selected themselves and watch the system deteriorate even further, because I&rsquo;d be willing to bet any black they would select couldn&rsquo;t pass even a H.S. GED test, no matter if he has PHD&rsquo;s after his name, which he has been generously given by radical leftists in academia as part of their racist affirmative action policy.</p>
<p>Left unchecked, black racism will cause an area to self-destruct better and faster than any K-person with a scheme ever could accomplish himself.</p>
<p>And, looking at black run governments here and in Africa strongly reveals just that. </p>

		<p>To people like Lawson, a government position is just an opportunity to grab some goodies. I attended a majority black school and it didn&rsquo;t matter. I took my books home, studied them myself and got a fine education. It really didn&rsquo;t matter what the superintendent, teachers and other students did. Nothing would have mattered.</p>

		<p>A lot of my ancestors came from that region of Penna.  I did a lot of research and reconstructed the world of 100 even 200 years ago.  It was an all white world.  </p>
<p>Several of my ancestors were in the union army and fought to save the union and free the slaves.  </p>
<p>How can the descendants of those slaves call people like me, the descendants of those who put their life on the line for them, racists?  When did the blacks move in and become such a presence?  Why do whites even spend their money anymore on lost causes?</p>

<p>We see it all too clearly here in SA. Blacks simply are incapable of running a country (or anything).The RATE of decline is accelerating here. Almost NO whites in goverment service anymore (AA to blame).Corruption endemic - so much so that it&rsquo;s almost normal.</p>

		<p>Same old story. Several years ago the Peralta College District Board of Governors in Oakland, California was looking for a new Chancellor to run everything. They of course wanted someone who was black. They could not find one qualified black person in the entire United States (or so they claim). They decided to hire Elihu Harris, a friend of members on the board(coincidence?), temporarily until they could find a qualified person. They eventually decided to make him the permanent Chancellor. Elihu Harris stole money (Oakland Tribune) and ran the four colleges into the ground, forcing them to lay off some of the lower paid employees who actually get the work done. His contract was not renewed last year, but he wasn&rsquo;t fried. Almost everyone in contact with Elihu Harris knew he was stealing from the college, but nobody said anything because he was a sacred black man.</p>
<p>Peralta Community College in Oakland is where Huey Newton got his education. Many other black radicals were educated in the Peralta Colleges.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s probably just a coincidence. It absolutely has to be, if we want to be politically correct. But it is ALWAYS the city or state with a large subpopulation of Blacks of Latinos (a p.c. term for illegal immigrants)   &mdash;   that is always hovering at bankruptcy.</p>
<p>California, home to a veritable FLOOD of illegal immigrants. Those cities in the Rust Belt. (Philly, New York, Camden, Milwaukee, Chicago, etc., etc., etc.). In extremely bad financial straits, plagued with crime, corruption, slums and lack of jobs.</p>
<p>But in all honesty. Look at Haiti, look at any of those Caribbean &#8220;resort&#8221; destinations. Sure, the hotels look good, create an upbeat image. Then look beyond. At how the natives live and act. Look at the African nations, now freed of their European masters. Crime, corruption, civil wars, genocide, disease. Like I said. It just has to be a coincidence.</p>

		<p>Being from the Harrisburg Area originally it has had a downward spiral for years. This is the last gasp of a dying city. When I drive through Harrisburg now I see a little Detroit. It has been destroyed by criminal blacks and their Liberal enablers. </p>

		<p>The one thing you people have to remember is that to the whites who live there, this is home.  If they let blacks run it, &#8216;plantation master&rsquo; style, the norm will become one of blacks coming ruin the lives of the palefaces.</p>
<p>Because history has shown that they won&rsquo;t &#8216;save&rsquo; us when they can&rsquo;t save themselves as they don&rsquo;t have even an internal racial identity beyond what filling up the tote bag with the perks and privileges of office allows.  Such that they will not maintain even the semblance of keeping the institution on an even keel, only in exploiting their position within it.</p>
<p>Northern whites are going to have to learn a lesson which Southern ones have known for a long time: however futile and pointless and disgusting the fight &#8216;to do the right thing&rsquo; for other ethnies may be, it is better to sustain an existence and influence in their communities than to let them become a blight which splays out over the entire civil service bureaucracy until their position at the top spoils the system itself.</p>
<p>The alternative, and it is one which I support while we have the strength to be determinative in our choices, is to back away slowly and in a cohesive fashion with movements by key (high intelligence, high dedication) white populations to a post-USA monoblock of WSM states which can sustain themselves independently.  Post Secession.</p>
<p>Even here there will have to be whites that keep the lights burning on the Titanic until the last lifeboats are away.</p>

<p>By retreating in this fashion I can&rsquo;t help but think we&rsquo;d be ripe for the pick&rsquo;n by the communist Chinese.  They&rsquo;d have the manpower to overrun the darkies and our little colony, without a seaport, air or naval power we would be virtually helpless.</p>
<p>The perception that we only have to fear the mooslims is a fraud.  The same communist menace still lurks, it&rsquo;s just in stealth mode.</p></p>
