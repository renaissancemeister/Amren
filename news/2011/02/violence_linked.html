<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=263813">Violence Linked to Immigrant-Help Programs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank York, WorldNetDaily, February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Over the past decade, the United Nations, U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s Office of Refugee Resettlement and a wide range of immigrant advocates including religious organizations have been answering the desires expressed by Muslims in Somalia and bringing thousands into the United States.</p>
<p>The result? Violence and social conflict is on the rise where large groups have settled in Minneapolis; Seattle; Nashville; Shelbyville, Tenn.; Garden City, Kan.; Emporia, Kan.; St. Louis and Greeley, Colo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem, experts suggest, is that the societal standards in the Islam-dominated Somalia and the United States are too different to simply transplant those, even the needy, from one place to the other without someone standing in the gap and offering guidance.</p>
<p>For example, in Somalia, Muslims periodically behead Christians simply for being Christian. Other members of the community are stoned for offenses such as adultery. Women are beaten for failing to cover themselves according to Muslim doctrine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Importing violence</b></p>
<p>After all, since Somalia gained its independence as a U.N. protectorate some 50 years ago, it has been {snip} run by a network of vicious clan warlords, sea-going pirates, khat-smoking terrorists and their friends.</p>
<p>Critics suggest that those factors, clan rivalries, religious beliefs and social customs, have been brought directly into the U.S. along with the immigrants, and those create huge conflicts.</p>
<p>Documentation of violence related to the immigrant community has come from the Minneapolis, Seattle, Nashville and other areas where large number of Somalis have congregated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Workplace demands</b></p>
<p>Then there have been the demands by Somali workers of their employers:</p>
<p>* Officials in Emporia, Kan., reported a spike in latent tuberculosis cases and outrage from residents when large numbers of Somalis began arriving in 2006 to work at a Tyson Foods plant and made demands of their employer.</p>
<p>* Somali meat packing workers in Grand Island, Neb., caused problems with Latino and other workers when they insisted that the company provide a schedule that allowed them time for their evening prayers. {snip}</p>
<p>* More than 200 Somalis working at a JBS meat packing plant in Greeley, Colo., walked off the job in September 2008. They were angry that the company wouldn&rsquo;t let them have a regular prayer schedule during working hours. The company eventually fired more than 100 of the protesters.</p>
<p>* More Somalis in a Tyson Foods plant in Tennessee also demanded that the company replace the Labor Day holiday with a day off for the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr. {snip}<br>
Reporter Brian Mosely of the Shelbyville Times-Gazette reported:</p>
<p>&#8220;I found that there was just an enormous culture clash going on here. The Somalis were  &mdash;  according to a lot of the people I talked to here  &mdash;  being very, very rude, inconsiderate, very demanding. They would go into stores and haggle over prices. They would also demand to see a male salesperson, would not deal with women in stores. Their culture is totally alien to anything the residents are used to.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about people who have not had any experience with Western civilization. They don&rsquo;t know the language. Things like running water are a miracle to some of these folks .&nbsp;.&bnsp;. you don&rsquo;t take people from a totally alien culture, put them into a community, and then say &#8216;alright, you must get along,&rsquo;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Funding resettlement</b></p>
<p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the agency that recommends who is to be considered for entrance into the U.S. as a refugee, and the U.S. Department of State&rsquo;s Office of Refugee Resettlement works with the U.N. to determine who is granted refugee status in the U.S.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1990s, the U.S. determined who received refugee status  &mdash;  and refugees from Muslim countries were low on the list.</p>
<p>However, in recent years this has shifted. Now, there are high numbers of refugees from Iraq, Burma, Bhutan, Iran and Somalia. In fact, at least 40 percent of the refugees are Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Refugee Settlement Watch, when these Muslims arrive, they automatically are eligible for federal, state and local welfare programs for 30 days.</p>
<p>Federal assistance includes Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, food stamps, public housing, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Child Care and Development Fund, Low-Income Energy Assistance, Postsecondary Education loans and grants and more.</p>
<p>Further, Muslims and other refugees are resettled by charitable organizations, including many funded by George Soros-front groups.</p>
<p>Ann Corcoran, who runs the Refugee Settlement Watch website, reports the Soros link to many immigration/refugee &#8220;reform&#8221; groups, including:</p>
<p>* American Immigration Council<br>
* American Immigration Law Foundation<br>
* Fair Immigration Reform Movement<br>
* Immigrant Defense Project<br>
* Immigrant Legal Resource Center<br>
* Immigrant Workers Citizenship Project<br>
* Immigration Policy Center<br>
* Migration Policy Institute<br>
* National Immigration Law Center</p>
<p>The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) provides funding for other organizations, including the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition based in Nashville.</p>
<p>The MPI also receives funding from Unbound Philanthropy, run by William Reeves. He provides funding for the American Immigration Law Foundation, International Rescue Committee, Southern Poverty Law Center and the International Rescue Committee. Reeves also donated to Active Voice, a radical group in San Francisco that has produced a film attacking Shelbyville residents for their reaction to the Somali invasion of the quiet town.</p>
<p><b>Addressing the problem</b></p>
<p>But is there a solution?</p>
<p>Corcoran has some suggestions: &#8220;As a conservative I don&rsquo;t believe the government should be taking money from citizens and giving it with virtually no oversight to non-profit groups and churches. Funding your charitable causes is not a function of government. Real charity .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is for you to put your time and money into caring for people  &mdash;  immigrants, refugees or other impoverished people  &mdash;  not badgering others to do so or taking (stealing!) their money to redistribute it to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued, &#8220;Refugee families should be individually sponsored by churches or other groups in a truly charitable endeavor, and we should not take more families than we can take care of. There are millions of refugees in the world and we will be only able to take so many, so we should be doing it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes no sense to bring in tens of thousands of refugees and place them on welfare and other public assistance either. Unless, of course, you are a proponent of the Cloward-Piven/Alinsky strategy of bringing about crisis to crash our form of government,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been so beaten over the head that all cultures are equal that we have to start thinking about the possibility that all cultures are not equal. Some people are raised in a culture of lying, cheating, stealing and murdering and think nothing of it because that&rsquo;s part of their culture. Islam contributes to this attitude, too. Islam says that Muslims can do anything they want to infidels because we&rsquo;re the scum of the earth. There are some cultures that will fit in America and some cultures won&rsquo;t,&#8221; she said.<br>

		<p>One of the popular frauds Somalis learn in the West is to have multiple wives with children, each living on welfare benefits.</p>
<p>The marriages are formal under Sharia law, but not registered under Western law. This makes the man quite wealthy, while keeping him exempt from child support.</p>

		<p>I am sorry to say that my country&rsquo;s elite has a death wish for the nation.  To bring ANY foreign muslims after 9/11 is not only stupid and irrational, but potentially suicidal.  Rational behavior would have been to seriously look at - at a start- all foreign-born muslims, and begin deportation proceedings after the atrocity.  But no, thanks to Bush and others, we inexplicably went the other way, and brought MORE IN.   Can anyone explain why?  Can anyone explain how this is is even minimally good for the U.S.?  Maybe the U.S. needs a little bit of the street revolution a la Egypt.</p>

		<p>What do you call it when someone takes your earnings and uses your money to import murderers for the purpose of destroying your country?</p>
<p>For now we&rsquo;re calling it tolerance, multiculturalism, diversity, relief, and refugee status.</p>
<p>None of those names is honest, though.</p>

		<p>The answer to the immigration problem is simple. Every immigrant that comes in must have a sponsor. The sponsor agrees to be responsible for the immigrant and any action taken by said immigrant for the rest of their natural life to include providing for all their needs. Make these churches and other organizations face up to the problems they are causing. </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re going to continue to flood into mid-sized, predominantly white cities.  Since Somalia has no government the US government won&rsquo;t deport them.  The result: ridiculously high crime rates, white victimization, the beginning of infinite generational welfare dependence, and white flight.  Those responsible should be stripped of their wealth and have their families placed in the same neighborhoods as these creatures.</p>

		<p>Islam (not a religion, but a political system DISGUISED as a religion) has one primary goal:  to subjugate and govern the entire world, BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY.  That means if you&rsquo;re not Muslim, they will kill you if you don&rsquo;t convert.  It tells Muslims to do that in the Medinan section of the Koran, AND in the &#8220;true sayings of the Prophet&#8221; - the Ahadith.  We in America have never seen anything like Islam, simply because there IS nothing else like it anywhere.  We need to wise up, recognize that Islam IS our enemy, and do whatever we need to do to eradicate it from the USA.  There is no place here for Muslims.  Let them go back to where they came from - if they&rsquo;re so superior, why aren&rsquo;t their homelands blooming with prosperity for all?</p>

		<p>A chiseled in stone criteria needs to be developed to determine when immigrants are turned into emigrants. We need to have a policy that contains mechanisms for automatic expulsion of foreign criminals. No due process, just a boat ride. </p>

<p>The crying is beginning now, both here and in Europe.  When the process all began in earnest, did this woman and others really believe it would be successful?  Surely no one is that dimwitted are they?</p>
<p>Of course they are, or they&rsquo;re caught up in the thought that they want to do good in spite of the obvious ramifications.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re well into it now, and the flow isn&rsquo;t abating, nor has the economy stopped its downward trajectory.  Yes, we&rsquo;re heading toward a Cloward/Pivens moment as we continue falling into financial catastrophe, but I hope the followers of these two oddballs don&rsquo;t get too excited about creating a classless society just yet, because I&rsquo;m afraid reality tells us we will skip that part and go right into conflict, separation, secession and conflict on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Not only that, I&rsquo;m for eliminating the tax exempt status for most institutions that have them, churches, religious institutions, private charities, trusts, 501-c-x orgs, whatever.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that Soros money is behind so much of this, especially since his money is being used to import a religion of people who would do to him what was almost done to Soros himself.</p>

East Asian immigrants and Jewish immigrants nearly always perform well in the United States and behave decently. This cannot be said of other immigrant groups. These differences should be considered when deciding who to admit and who to exclude. </p>

		<p>These so called conservatives, like Corcoran, strive to make crazy immigration policies slightly less crazy.If America were normal, none of these Somalians would be allowed in this country. If Americans wanted to help Somalians, either publicly or privately, it would be done in Somalia, not in America. </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s immigration rate would be no greater than America&rsquo;s emigration rate. Immigrant lovers bloviate about the gifts that immigrants bring. Perhaps immigrants do bring gifts to some Americans: cheap labor, more Democrats elected, erosion of traditional Western culture.  To me immigrants have brought overcrowding, pollution, and unemployment.</p>

		<p>Somalis make bad Americans?  What?  Well&hellip;maybe&hellip;.it&hellip;is&hellip;&hellip;because&hellip;&hellip;THEY ARE NOTHING AT ALL LIKE US!!!  They will never assimilate and ever if they could they would choose not to because they have been brainwashed to believe we are all bad.  They have been taught to kill, rape, and steal from Americans.  And if one or two get out of line for a minute, fifty Muhounds slap him on the back of the head and tell him he&rsquo;s missing the big picture.  I have an idea.  No more immigrants at all, not a single one, until unemployment gets to about 5% (true 5%).</p>

		<p>The gatekeepers who are letting them through the border don&rsquo;t care if Somalians don&rsquo;t share our culture or values.</p>
<p>This is about increasing consumption of globally traded commodities, which is how people like Soros make their wealth.</p>
<p>As a side effect, immigration gradually marginalizes whites to a minority among minorities, reducing our ability to challenge the unelected power structure.</p>

<p>This is insane and frightening.  The UN, archenemy of Western Civilization controls who gets refugee status and where they are to be placed. The UN and it&rsquo;s leftist supporters have accelerated the timetable for civil war both in Europe and in the US with the push for more and more moslem immigration into the West.  The goal of these people is to destroy the white race through unending nonwhite immigration, they are truly evil.  </p>

		<p>Somalis are all over the western world. They&rsquo;re popping up all over Canada and the United States, pretty much all of western Europe, and also down under. I read that there&rsquo;s a &#8216;thriving&rsquo; Somali population in Hobart, Tasmania, of all places!</p>
<p>These people do not adapt to western culture and they cause problems wherever they go. It&rsquo;s like inviting a rabid fox into a house full of children - mayhem will inevitably arise. I can&rsquo;t imagine the Somalis are grateful for what they&rsquo;ve been given by whites. They desperately want to be around whites, for whites can provide a much better standard of living than anyone else, but they also seem (in my opinion) to have a deep-seated animosity towards whites and western culture. And I highly doubt that that&rsquo;s going to change.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder, given the Somalis&rsquo; high rates of immigration and high birth rates, if they&rsquo;ll end up the majority population in western countries, with whites reduced to dhimmi status, having to slave away and nothing more to provide their new Somali masters with the level of civilization that only whites can provide.<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s some truth in that, although businesses that do not increase profits are dormant, dying, or dead. Also, everyday middle-American stockholders demand ever-increasing profits and then partake of them. It&rsquo;s also true that labor unions &mdash; i.e. employer blackmail gangs &mdash; gave us $165,000 &#8220;custodial maintenance engineers&#8221; (janitors) who are replaced, after retirement with generous pensions, by the cheap labor you mention. </p>

		<p>Here is the moral of the story:If Native Born White Americans are reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America, there will be a  transfer of power to high fertility post-1965 non-whites such as the Somali Muslims. And what I mean by a transfer  of power I mean this:high fertility post-1965 nonwhites will be the majority in the US military and police forces across &#8220;America&#8221;. And when this happens, We should expect to be  persecuted violently. In real blood and guts terms, if you want to know what it would be like to be racial minority in &#8220;America&#8221;, just take a look at what happend to CBS news reporter Laura Logan in Eygpt yesterday. She was brutally ganged raped by who knows how many Muslim Eygptian Men.</p>
<p>Who is going to run to the defense of a violently persecuted White racial minority within the borders of America? No one&hellip;if you think otherwise, you are 100 percent delusional. I have come across White Americans who serioulsy believe that racial minority status for Whites means an end to affirmative action&hellip;this is striking example of magical thinking..if there ever was.</p>

<p>John Engelman: &ldquo;Cheap labor is a gift to the rich Republicans who fired you in order to get pay raises and higher profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some truth in that, although businesses that do not increase profits are dormant, dying, or dead. Also, everyday middle-American stockholders demand ever-increasing profits and then partake of them. It&rsquo;s also true that labor unions &mdash; i.e. employer blackmail gangs &mdash; gave us $165,000 &ldquo;custodial maintenance engineers&rdquo; (janitors) who are replaced, after retirement with generous pensions, by the cheap labor you mention. <br>

There is more than some truth, read this.<br>

I doubt there are many janitors who make $165,000 a year. Most middle Americans are dependent on pay checks that buy less than they did when Bill Clinton left office. </p>

		<p>#11 &#8220;I&rsquo;m for eliminating the tax exempt status for most institutions that have them, churches, religious institutions, private charities, trusts, 501-c-x orgs, whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, this is a must.  I have been researching the charities of my own Catholicism and some of the worst violators of US sovereignty are found with the behaviors of some local Catholic Charities(CC).  It shocked me to discover some of the cities mentioned in the article had &#8220;shipments&#8221; of muslims courtesy of CCs.  While almost every religious group has been infiltrated by socialists/communists over the last 50 or so years, no where is that more obvious than in the Catholic Church.  I have concluded after much research, these instances are not religious based or even &#8220;social conscience&#8221; based.  I really believe there is a political agenda designed to harm the traditional United States and its citizens.  What to do?  First stop all donations to churches or charities that are undermining this country.  Then, get involved in your church.  Become a radical for good, demand that churches look after the soul and not enter into activities that are not their business.  Complain.  Complain to your congressman even if they are not on our side.  Don&rsquo;t let these folks off of the hook, identify them, put their words of betrayal on YouTube, make them uncomfortable in their world.  There should be an open mind to greater militancy later, if need be. </p>

<p>My main point in my advocacy is that these non-profit institutions&rsquo; &#8220;charity work&#8221; mainly consists of showing people how to get on government welfare.  So they contribute to governments&rsquo; expenses, and due to their non-profit status, don&rsquo;t have to contribute to governments&rsquo; assets (except the salaries of 501-c-xes are subject to income taxes).  My other main point is that so many of these churches are directly involved in facilitating the race replacement and dispossession of native born white Americans, with &#8220;refugee&#8221; and &#8220;sponsorship&#8221; programs, and they do a lot of charity work for Africa.  But almost zilch for white people who have been members of their churches for generations.</p>
