<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ARE Muslims taking over the world, or at a minimum, transforming Europe into Eurabia? Whatever your hopes or fears for the future of the world&rsquo;s religions, a report published this week has plenty to stoke them. &#8220;The Future of the Global Muslim Population&#8221;, produced by the Pew Research Centre, a non-profit outfit based in Washington, DC, reckons Muslim numbers will soar from 1.6 billion in 2010 to 2.2 billion by 2030. In other words, from 23.4% to 26.4% of the global total.</p>
<p>At the heart of its analysis is the ongoing effect of a &#8220;youth bulge&#8221; which peaked in 2000. In 1990 Islam&rsquo;s share of the world&rsquo;s youth was 20%; in 2010, 26%. In 2030 it will be 29% (of 15-to-29-year-olds). But the Muslim world is slowly heading towards paunchiness: the median age in Muslim-majority countries was 19 in 1990. It is 24 now, and will be 30 by 2030. (For French, Germans and Japanese the figure is 40 or over.) This suggests Muslim numbers will ultimately stop climbing, but later than the rest of the world population.</p>
<p>The authors call their calculations demographic, not political. Drawing on earlier Pew research, they say conversion is not a big factor in the global contest between Islam, Christianity and other faiths; the converts balance out. Nor do they assess piety; via the imperfect data of the United Nations, the European Union and national statistics, they aim simply to measure how many people call themselves Muslim, at least culturally, if asked.</p>
<p>New numbers, they say, will change the world map. As Indonesia prospers, its birth rate is falling; South Asia&rsquo;s remains very high. By 2030, 80m extra mouths in Pakistan will boost its Muslim numbers to 256m, ousting Indonesia (with 239m) as the most populous Islamic land. India&rsquo;s Muslim minority will be nearly as large at 236m  &mdash;  though growth is slowing there too. And in 2030 India&rsquo;s Muslims will still constitute only a modest 15.9% of that country&rsquo;s swelling total, against 14.6% now.</p>
<p>The report asserts no causal link between Islamic teaching and high fertility rates, although it notes that poverty and poor education are a problem in many Muslim lands. In Muslim countries such as Bangladesh and Turkey, it observes, the lay and religious authorities encourage birth control. Better medical care and lower mortality boost poor-country population numbers too.</p>
<p>Some bleak findings concern Nigeria, where Muslim numbers are seen rising to 117m in 2030 from 76m now, edging up from 47.9% to 51.5% of the population. Illiteracy among Nigerian women of child-bearing age is three times as high among Muslims (71.9%) as among others (23.9%). Two-thirds of Nigerian Muslim women lack any formal education; that goes for just over a tenth of their non-Muslim sisters. The fertility rate is between six and seven children per Muslim woman, versus five for non-Muslims. It is hard to prove that these factors are related, but they do seem to form a pattern.</p>
<p><b>Eurabian nights</b></p>
<p>The total Muslim share of Europe&rsquo;s population is predicted to grow from 6% now to 8% in 2030: hardly the stuff of nightmares. But amid that are some sharp rises. The report assumes Britain has 2.9m Muslims now (far higher than the usual estimates, which suggest 2.4m at most), rising to 5.6m by 2030. As poor migrants start families in Spain and Italy, numbers there will rocket; in France and Germany, where some Muslims are middle-class, rises will be more modest  &mdash;  though from a higher base. Russia&rsquo;s Muslims will increase to 14.4% or 18.6m, up from 11.7% now (partly because non-Muslims are declining). The report takes a cautious baseline of 2.6m American Muslims in 2010, but predicts the number will surge by 2030 to 6.2m, or 1.7% of the population  &mdash;  about the same size as Jews or Episcopalians. In Canada the Muslim share will surge from 2.8% to 6.6%.</p>
<p>How will liberal democracies accommodate such variety? The clarity of a written constitution may give America an advantage over many European countries, where unwritten custom has more sway. Jonathan Laurence, an Islam-watcher and professor at Boston College, thinks Europe could rise to the challenge, but failure is also easy to imagine. Europe&rsquo;s Muslims should, by 2030, have become articulate and effective political bargainers. But with nativism on the march, it is also highly possible that Muslims will come to feel they have less in common with their fellow citizens than with their growing band of co-religionists elsewhere.<br>

		<p>Has anyone else noticed that the vast majority of Muslims come from totally uneducated, poverty-stricken, dregs-of-humanity places?  That fact tells me that Islam appeals only to misogynistic men and low class, stupid, and ignorant people.  No well-educated person, UNLESS it was a male who was power-mad, would ever convert to such a bloodthirsty (yes, forget the Meccan section of the Koran; look at the Medinan section and the Ahadith) socalled &#8220;religion.&#8221;  I don&rsquo;t believe Islam is a relgion at all.  It is a political system garbed as a religion, and reaping the rewards thereof in the world.  The world needs to wise up, see Islam for what it is, and treat it as it is - a primitive system designed to completely destroy women&rsquo;s rights and to conquer the entire world by violent means.</p>

		<p>The late Yassir Arafat said that wombs of the Palestinian women are &#8220;their secret weapon&#8221; in the conflict with Isreal. The Palestinian birthrate is 6-7 times that of the Isrealis! Then, of course, when they are starving, the UN comes to their aid.</p>

<p>Ah of course, can&rsquo;t be any link.</p>
<p>And the claim of &#8220;poverty&#8221; causing everything, as if poverty is simply dictated by an arbitrary god or something.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I believe this article.  The situation in Egypt brought forward the fact that 60% of Egypt&rsquo;s population is under 25.  I recall something similar said about Iran not long ago.  It is the young who get onto computers and notice that life can be much better than where they are, which gets them to act, eventually.  I think what is going on Egypt is dangerous, yes but it is also a great chance for a better future for everyone.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree wholly.  Many young people all over the West convert because they sense it as the Vietnam protest of the time.  The ones that waved NVA flags in the &rsquo;60s would convert to Islam today.</p>

 <br>
 <br>
A youth bulge, or a high percentage of young men, has always been a dangerous factor in world affairs. The First World War began in the Balkans, when that region had a youth bulge. When Japan invaded China in 1937, Japan had a youth bulge.<br>
 <br>
The problem with a youth bulge is that young men enter job markets that have little use for them. They feel they have little to live for, so they have little fear of death.<br>
 <br>
A generation and more ago Latin America had a youth bulge. Right wing dictatorships competed violently with left wing revolutionary movements. Since then the birth rate in Latin America has declined. The countries are developing democratic governments.  <br>
 <br>
A major reason the Soviet Union fell with little violence was the fact that the USSR did not have a youth bulge. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen statistics that show different percentages of 10, 20 even 30 percent in Europe by 2030-2050.  Even if 8 percent is correct, it&rsquo;s hardly a comforting figure considering the number of muslims in Europe outside of the Balkan region was almost negligent 30 years ago. Couple that with the number of nonwhites who aren&rsquo;t muslim and you come up with some pretty high numbers.  </p>
<p>&#8220;But with nativism on the march, it is also highly possible that Muslims will come to feel they have less in common with their fellow citizens than with their growing band of co-religionists elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and nativism is for those who are NATIVE to Europe so maybe these muslims should join their band of co-religionists in their own countries before they are thrown out of Europe.</p>

		<p>I think this article is quite un-biased and fair.  In fact, the tone suggests the Islamic surge should be viewed with a certain amount of fear, or at least caution.  I must say, a modest 2% rise of the Islamic population in Europe is not as bad as what I expected, but of course 8% Islamic is still far too high for the continent once referred to simply as, &#8220;Christendom.&#8221;</p>
