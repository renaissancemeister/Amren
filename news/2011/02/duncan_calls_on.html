<h1>Duncan Calls On Black Men to Become Teachers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Diamond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and filmmaker Spike Lee teamed up Monday to urge more black men to consider teaching.</p>
<p>More than 1 million teachers will retire during the next decade, according to federal estimates, and leaders have embarked on a nationwide drive to build a more diverse teaching force. {snip}<br>
Teachers should look more like the people they serve, Duncan said. While more than 35 percent of the nation&rsquo;s public school students are black or Latino, less than 15 percent of the teachers are black or Latino, according to federal figures. Less than 2 percent of the nation&rsquo;s teachers are black men.</p>
<p>In Georgia, about half of the public schoolchildren are black or Latino, but only about 25 percent of the teachers are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is wrong with that picture,&#8221; Duncan said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to fix it. We&rsquo;ve got to fix it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Knowing some students don&rsquo;t enter teaching because of the low pay, Duncan reminded them of programs that will erase their college debt if they work as a public schoolteacher for 10 years.</p>
<p>Duncan and other officials promoted the federal TEACH campaign, launched last fall to persuade more minorities and men to go into teaching.</p>

		<p>Black men wont become teachers because it takes too much dedication,work,fairness, patience, and most of all, they dont want to be the victims of the same kind of abuse that thay gave out to the teachers that they had.</p>

		<p>How much money are we (White tax payers) going to spend subsidizing fairy tale I wonder. Here&rsquo;s an idea. Instead of increasing teachers who are black males (won&rsquo;t happen anyway), lets reduce the number of illegal invaders in our schools that happen to be hispanic. Blacks can simply stay home since they have no desire to be educated by Whitey anyway. </p>
<p>Problem solved!<br>

		<p>Blacks have to FIRST finish high school.  Even those blacks who are in college due to football scholarships jump ship at the very first opportunity to play pro ball, which was their goal anyway, and gladly shun the rest of their degree candidacy.  They were only there to get noticed by pro ball anyway.  They never had any plans to actually DO anything with a college degree.  Who hires African Studies majors?  Moreover, poster number one is correct.  The LAST thing blacks want to be is a teacher in the inner city.<br>
They know what it&rsquo;s like because THEY WERE the problem in inner city schools.  Lastly, doing anything other than playing pro ball after college is viewed by all other blacks as &#8220;acting white&#8221; and to blacks there is no greater sin, or reason for a beat down.</p>

The irony never seems to get through to these people.</p>
<p>They demanded to be sent to the white schools because the white schools were better and now they want to turn the white schools into the black schools they left.</p>
<p>Only black men can become black teachers. If black men aren&rsquo;t stepping up to the plate, the black community should be holding them accountable; not the schools, not the white teachers, not the school boards.</p>
<p>Call a spade a spade. Black men aren&rsquo;t taking any role in teaching their youth.<br>

		<p>So long as the trend of segregating students by race to ensure that black kids are taught by black teachers who &#8220;get them&#8221;, training black men to be teachers is a good thing.<br>
 <br>
And when a couple of girls every year get pregnant by the English teacher, I&rsquo;m sure everyone will be very understanding.</p>

<p>I thought race shouldn&rsquo;t matter?  Well, Duncan old boy, which is it?  Does race matter or not?  I thought you were working toward a color blind society.  Everything you do is based on race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than 2 percent of the nation&rsquo;s teachers are black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>And of that 2% I&rsquo;m betting that more than 75% are unqualified and could not pass a GED test.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the number of teen age pregnancies will skyrocket above even today&rsquo;s astronomical rates with the minorities in the schools. Black men have demonstrated quite clearly that they can not control their urges when it comes to having sex, and creating babies, with numerous underage females. Putting more of them in an authority position such as teachers in the schools will have distratrous effects! </p>

		<p>&#8220;Teachers should look more like the people they serve, Duncan said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming from the U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, is an argument in favor of segregation: The group of students must all look more like the teacher which means the students must look like each other.  However, in order to achieve this, the classrooms or even the school would have to be segregated. This would undo the &ldquo;gains&rdquo; made over the past half century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how liberal dogma is full of contradictions that they don&rsquo;t recognize or acknowledge. <br>

<p>Does anyone acually think that, after becoming a teacher, a black male will choose to teach black inner city ghetto &#8216;yufs&rsquo;? Most will choose to teach at White schools where they have a much greater chance of winning a ghetto lottery and Whites bending over backward [ and forward ] to prove they&rsquo;re not &#8216;racisss&rsquo;. Which one would YOU choose?  </p>

		<p>In the past week, we&rsquo;ve had stories on AR bemoaning the paucity of blacks as public school teachers and accountants.  In the recent past, there have been stories at AR about a similar lack of black lawyers.  Funny, they keep telling us they used to be kings and queens of great civilizations that built the pyramids and invented everything useful, including space travel.  Yet, they are now said merely to aspire to being teachers, accountants and lawyers.  What a bummer.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no way in hell I would teach in Atlanta!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a white female, born and live again in a town southwest of Atlanta. I don&rsquo;t think most men would have the patience to put up with those kids. I substitued for high school and middle schools at the end of 2009. (My mother taught high school. I wasn&rsquo;t naive of the way it was. I didn&rsquo;t bother to try to discipline them. If they get suspended, they win. If nothing happens, they win. I just wanted it quiet.) I left one day at lunch. I&rsquo;d finally had enough. I went to the front and told them they were going to have to find someone else because I was leaving. </p>
<p>Every problem starts at home. The schools are getting worse. The administration&rsquo;s hands are tied. They&rsquo;re scared they&rsquo;ll get sued. They have no backbone. (Our schools mirror our government.) </p>

		<p>1.  The stats say that Black men who are capable of gaining college entrance, then actually graduating and finally passing most states basic teacher competency certifications are few and far between.<br>
2.  The Black men that are actually capable of this are in high demand by other government agencies from Fire Departments to Equal Employment Opportunity offices.  Additionally basic competent Black man will make the big political correct corporations day.  Whew, now they have a face of diversity for the annual report pictures and those pesky government statistics.  In a sense if a Black man can truly qualify to be a teacher, then they can right there own ticket as demand is high for there services.   </p>
<p>FYI - they did a good job of repeating of the underpaid teacher myth and of course the reporting does no challenge of that.</p>
<p>Finally the obvious and usual solution just lower standards. </p>

		<p>Considering the sorry state of education in this country I should think they would be looking for teachers who were GOOD rather than teachers who were simply Black. Personally, I don&rsquo;t much care what color a teacher is as long as they&rsquo;re good. But, then, I&rsquo;m not looking for an excuse to justify some more government <i>handouts</i>.</p>

		<p>Har-dee-har, Mr. super leftist Arne Duncan.  There are way fewer white teachers now than in the &#8220;evil&#8221; times, when like taught like.</p>

		<p>I am a licensed teacher.  To earn my state license, beyond the obvious schooling, I had to fill out multiple forms many many times to prove that I&rsquo;ve never been convicted or even accused of a sexual crime.  The forms were, my opinion, very detailed and thorough.  In other words, to become a teacher in my state, you must have a spotless history in those regards to get a teaching job.   </p>

		<p>I agree that teachers should look like the people they serve. I&rsquo;m white, and all throughout my school years I never had a black teacher. Instead, I had teachers that did their best and expected mine; who were well behaved and expected good behavior; who were almost always there and expected good attendance; who were well-dressed and expected me to be also; who were honest and expected honesty. I made virtually all A&rsquo;s through school (except for that nasty little semester I had a hard time grasping Geometry for a while). Yep, I had teachers that looked like me. </p>

		<p>When the students are mostly white there are calls for more diversity and for persons of color to teach there. When the students, or the citizens, are mostly people of color, there are assurances that people of color can only be properly served by people of color. </p>
