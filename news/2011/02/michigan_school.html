			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, February 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The decision by the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools reverses a ban put in place in December after a fourth-grader at a Canton Township elementary school was found with a dull, 3- to 5-inch kirpan.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The principal initially let the boy keep the kirpan, but the school board instituted a ban because of parental concerns and conflicts with the district&rsquo;s rules against bringing weapons to school.</p>
<p>The Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV report that under the new guidelines, kirpans meeting certain criteria will be allowed for Sikh students.<br>

		<p>WHAT!  I have read numerous stories about little boys being expelled for bring half-inch long green toy machnes guns to school as weapons (you know, the ones that come with the little green soldiers most boys have as kids).  Girls expelled as drug dealers because they gave an aspirin to another girl because she had menstrual cramps.  Five year old boys thrown out of school as sexual predators because they tugged on a girls skirt.  A girl who had a table knife in her lunch box because her mother accidently left it there was arrested.  I personnally know a woman whose son was almost expelled for drawing nazi symbols while drawing pictures of soldiers, fortunately he threw the offending picture out the window before the teacher got it.  But a sikh can bring a knife to school.  When in Rome do as the Romans, otherwise go home.  Knives and dirty turbans on sikhs should be banned.  Disgusting and primitive habits that have no place in a 21st century nation.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many of these weapons are going to be stolen and used to injure or kill another kid.</p>
<p>These weapons won&rsquo;t be banned until that happens.</p>
<p>When I go to another country, I understand that I must abide by their rules, whether or not it offends my religious beliefs.</p>
<p>It is the white elitist lackeys who are to blame.</p>

		<p>This is just the thin edge of the wedge.</p>
<p>In Canada, the Sikhs demanded to wear their turbans in police uniforms. Canada allowed it.  </p>
<p>Then they demanded to wear kirpans everywhere, followed by demands that they be exempt from wearing hardhats on construction sites or motorcycle helmets, because these interferred with their turbans.</p>
<p>They want Sikh customs to dominate the host countries laws.</p>
<p>The Sikhs have a vision of themselves going global, as viewed in this map: <a href="/wiki/File_World_Sikh_Pop._Map_2004-02.png" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Sikh_Pop._Map_2004-02.png</a></p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re making it seem like it&rsquo;s some sort of a pious act of a pious boy.</p>
<p>I know seven and eight year olds.  A kid who gets to carry a knife around is NOT going to keep it hidden.  He&rsquo;s going to flaunt it and derive power from its possession.</p>
<p>The other kids will see it and want knives too, and&hellip;</p>

		<p>I was beyond speechless when I read this. I thought the school system had zero tolerance when in came to bringing weapons. But of course the spineless cowards running the schools don&rsquo;t want to seem racist, so a &#8220;religious&#8221; dagger is allowed as it adds to the &#8220;vibrancy&#8221; of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>And here we have, yet again, another story that gives good reason for homeschooling.</p>

<p>That these parents would even do this in the first place? They had to be put up to this? Someone coached them to send the kid to school with the dagger.</p>
<p>A dull dagger they call it. Daggers are a stabbing weapon and not cutting. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the dagger is dull or not! Certain criteria. For THEM. THEY can have a dagger. A whitey could not have ANY dagger under ANY circumstances.</p>

		<p>This should not even be an issue.  Sikhs should go to Sikh schools with other Sikhs, in their own country.  </p>
<p>As it is, we continually increase the burden of restrictive laws on whites,  while exempting non-whites from them, and even creating some laws awarding special privileges:  for non-whites only.   </p>
<p>The actual effect: whites become second-class citizens (at some point, we may not be considered citizens at all, once anti-white invaders establish more complete control)   and are on a slow crawl to slavery.  Already we work a fourth or a third of the year &#8220;for Uncle Sam&#8221;, being compelled to labor for the benefit of others under threat of loss of even more property and freedom, even as those others enjoy greater rights and privileges.   </p>
<p>So then, just whose country is this?    </p>

		<p>Why isn&rsquo;t the ACLU all over this? Why aren&rsquo;t they threatening to sue the school board for violating the separation of church and state? They should sue the school board for forcing non-Sikh students to be subjected to the presence of dangerous weapons in the hands of Sikhs.</p>
<p>If they allow Sikh students to carry knives as a &#8220;religious symbol&#8221;, then they are in violation of the First Amendment. They&rsquo;ll suspend a student for wearing a crucifix, but allow a Sikh to carry a dagger?</p>
<p>I remember reading in the NRA publication, &#8220;America&rsquo;s First Freedom&#8221;, a few years back, a school board in Maryland (I believe) suspended a second grade pupil for drawing a picture of an American soldier carrying a gun.</p>

		<p>A local restaurant some years ago had a policy that customers did not wear hats on the premises.  When so asked, a Sikh refused to comply and sued.  Decision: he won.  This event colors how I think about Sikhs - not favorably.  The restaurant in question was of long standing and well respected.    </p>

		<p>When I started public school a little over 50 years ago every boy in school owned and carried a pocket knife. No one thought anything about it and we were all advised to be carefull and not cut ourselves. I don&rsquo;t remember a single boy ever threatening another boy with a knife because we were not cowards and we fought with our fist. We did fight with each other and I got many black eyes and bloody noses but was never really hurt. It was considered all part of growing up. </p>
<p>So what happened in the last fifty years to make knives so dangerous? We all know the answer. </p>

		<p>May I point out that in my years in the muddled east, especially in Kuwait relative to the Sihks, they DO NOT CARRY those knives as the Kuwaitis do not allow it! Those Sihks in the U.S. and Canada know that White governments can be pushed around and fear being called racissssssssssssssssssss whereas the muslims do not!</p>

		<p>The problem is the public school system. How come there is no choice in what type of school to attend? Frankly, I think most parents would rather have their children attend a school where they could take OTC medication on their own and would not be disciplined, even arrested for all sorts of inane violations.</p>
<p>Honestly, how any parent would want their children attending a public school, as public school is organized today? Not too many.</p>
<p>Maybe in the suburbs and rural areas. But in the inner city? Almost none, regardless of their &#8220;stripe&#8221;.</p>

		<p>FYI Sikhs are allowed to use a small replica of the Kirpan (dagger) mostly attached to their Kangh (wooden comb) symbolically and meet the tenets of their religion, thousands of Sikhs do that all the time in India. The Kirpan replica is mostly about 3/4 &#8221; X 1/8th&#8221; sliver of metal and the wooden comb about 2&#8221; X 3&#8221;, there you have it. Sikhs themselves have taken liberty by miniaturizing two of their symbols also boast Kadas made of gold and silver while they should be made of steel historically. It was very wrong that Sikhs were attacked because of them wearing turbans or having beards, however, me thinks Sikhs are pushing this too far and it can come back to haunt them. We all need to learn compromise and reality. </p>

		<p>Times have sure changed for the worse. We used to bring pocket knives to high school to show off at the cafeteria. Those folks in the past are now painted as evil racists. Today you can&rsquo;t even display a drawn representation of a weapon. Tomorrow if you even dare, think of a weapon the government would prefer if your brain explodes, Scanners style, if this trend continues. You may not think of yourself as a free man nowadays. You&rsquo;re the hunted. The white male. The enemy of the global state.</p>
