			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tara Bahrampour, Washington Post, February 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A program that deputizes local police officers to enforce immigration laws sent the Hispanic population plummeting in many places across the United States, including Prince William and Frederick counties, according to a report released Monday by the Migration Policy Institute.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study focused on seven places  &mdash;  including Prince William and Frederick  &mdash;  that have adopted the federal 287 (g) program, which is in use by 70 state and local law enforcement agencies in 25 states.</p>
<p>Under the program, which costs $68 million annually, local police officers are trained to determine the immigration status of people they arrest and flag those found to be in the country illegally to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Once illegal immigrants are transferred to ICE custody, the U.S. government decides whether to begin deportation proceedings.</p>
<p>Although ICE has said it prioritizes deportation of people with serious criminal backgrounds, some of the jurisdictions participating in the program seek to remove as many undocumented immigrants as possible, regardless of their criminal background, the study found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Frederick and Prince William counties, fewer than 10 percent of those detained were arrested for the most serious, Level 1 crimes, which include murder, rape and armed robbery. In Las Vegas, by contrast, more than 50 percent of illegal immigrants detained were arrested for the most serious crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wide variation reflected in our study suggests that state and local actors, rather than ICE, are significantly defining the program&rsquo;s enforcement priorities,&#8221; says the report, which based its findings on ICE data and interviews conducted in the seven localities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins denied that the county is trying to deport as many illegal immigrants as possible but said undocumented traffic violators are potential threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you say that a [serious] Level 1 offender is more dangerous than an immigrant who&rsquo;s out driving a car illegally who could potentially hit someone and kill them?&#8221; Jenkins said, noting that those arrested are &#8220;in the country illegally to start with, and beyond that, they&rsquo;ve committed a crime. How many free passes do you give someone?&#8221;</p>
<p>The report says that targeting serious criminals makes more sense as an enforcement strategy, particularly when government resources are limited.</p>
<p>Pursuing unauthorized immigrants who haven&rsquo;t committed serious crimes &#8220;takes away resources to go after what everybody believes are the high-priority criminals,&#8221; said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst at MPI and one of the report&rsquo;s authors. &#8220;You can&rsquo;t have them be a top priority and then have the waitress or the gardener who&rsquo;s never broken a law except to be here illegally, you can&rsquo;t have them both be the top priority. When these state and local enforcement agencies fill up the detention centers and jails with low-priority cases .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it compromises ICE&rsquo;s ability to do high-priority enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also sows fear and distrust between local immigrant communities and the police, the report says.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates have long decried the 287 (g) program, saying that it leads to racial profiling and destroys relationships between police and immigrant communities.</p>
<p>Because of the controversy surrounding it, the program&rsquo;s growth has stalled. Another enforcement program, Secure Communities, has largely replaced it at the local level, although Secure Communities has been attacked for some of the same reasons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ICE has said it plans to expand the program to every state by 2013.</p>

		<p>Headline should read: Immigration Enforcement Program takes a toll on Illegal Invaders Who Happen to be Hispanic! Of course the MSM makes the headline read as if Hispanics are being victimized; when in fact, it&rsquo;s White America who is being victimized by their illegal invasion.</p>

		<p>The report says that targeting serious criminals makes more sense as an enforcement strategy, particularly when government resources are limited.</p>
<p>This is a bald faced lie.  The amount each illegal costs in welfare, in law enforcement overhead etc, is enormous.  And that is not counting the human cost&hellip;.murder, rape, drugs&hellip;..worse.  Each illegal deported is a gigantic net gain for government.  Spend $10 to get rid of them.  Save a million in future costs.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this, including ICE.  ICE has literally been told by Obama to keep as many future voters for the democratic party as possible in the country while getting rid of a few of the more visible criminals.</p>
<p>The states, of course, disagree with this and are forcing ICE to do its job.  Soon, the Congress will settle the matter and replace anyone in ICE that has a problem with doing their job.  </p>

		<p>Some people do not understand that illegal means illegal.  All illegal immigrants should be deported as soon as possible!</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight - so  ICE is essentially bemoaning that local PD&rsquo;s are helping them do the jog THEY are supposed to be doing in the first place?!? Only in America! And we wonder why we have these issues with the fox guarding the henhouse. </p>

		<p>If immigration advocates think police enforcing immigration laws will lead to fewer illegals reporting crimes, how will they ever know?  If they don&rsquo;t ask or aren&rsquo;t allowed to ask a persons status, how do they know if illegals are reporting crimes or not?  Answer:  They don&rsquo;t.  Its taken on pure faith and assumption.  Its a myth.  Illegals don&rsquo;t trust police anyway, so they will only report a crime if they have to, such as when they are injured and need medical care (at taxpayer expense.) Liberals are expert at creating unprovable assumptions.  The Achievement Gap, Global Warming, Diversity is a strength, The Glass Ceiling, etc.  Can&rsquo;t prove any of it, but repeat the lie often enough, and people will start to believe.  </p>

		<p>Nothing is having an effect like 287g. In a few years the liberals will not have a voter base of illegal aliens to place their hope of an anti white Racial-Socialist Utopia on. As the number of illegals dwindle the subject itself will no longer<br/>
be &#8220;controversial&#8221;. Foreigners like this Iranian newspaper hack  will have to look elsewhere for a way to subvert the country.  </p>

		<p> Of course these programs takes a toll on the U.S. Hispanic Population. American citizens of Hispanic descent must compete for scarce jobs with illegal aliens who just arrived from Mexico. I think most Latinos would rather not participate in the cheap labor global hiring hall. Illegal immigration has killed wages for millions of unemployed Americans. </p>
