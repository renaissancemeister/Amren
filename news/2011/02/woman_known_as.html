			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Roebuck and Bonnie Cook, Philadelphia Inquirer, February 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A musical artist who advertised buttock enhancement injections on YouTube under her performing name &#8220;Black Madam&#8221; is believed to be responsible for the death of one of her clients earlier this week in Philadelphia, police said in court filings.</p>
<p>Officers searched the apartment of Padge Victoria Windslowe, 41, after the several witnesses identified her as the woman who injected aspiring actress Claudia Seye Aderotimi, 20, with what she claimed was silicone in an airport hotel room earlier this week.</p>
<p>Aderotimi, who had traveled from London and allegedly paid Windslowe $1,800 for the procedure, died hours later at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, complaining of shortness of breath and chest pains.</p>
<p>Although investigators have not yet located Windslowe, several witnesses identified the same woman under different aliases, according to a search warrant affidavit for her apartment near the Lower Merion&rsquo;s Suburban Square shopping center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Theresa Gyamfi, 20, who traveled, with Aderotimi from England, knew her as Lillian Languri. She told investigators that she had witnessed Windslowe inject her friend and underwent a similar procedure herself.</p>

		<p>This has to be part of the &#8220;big boo-tay&#8221; craze or phenomenon. They inject their rears until they grow to immense size  &mdash;  -bigger than any prize pumpkin at the State Fair. Sad, but true. </p>

		<p>You&rsquo;d think people in Philadelphia would have given up on black doctors after the Kermit Gosnell horror.<br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/4j4x9ln" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/4j4x9ln</a></p>
<p>Gosnell&rsquo;s mostly black clients found nothing suspicious about the fact that he was paying a 15 year old girl to be his anesthesiologist! </p>

		<p>What complete and utter rubbish. She, along with thousands of other Nigerians are in UK as students but, as in this case, &#8216;wannabe&rsquo; actresses. Posted as a &#8216;British Resident&rsquo;.  As a student, of course she was a resident.  Actress.. no way. UK is awash with nigerians, many who perform all kinds of african rituals on their gullible fellow blacks as Whites wouldn&rsquo;t fall for such claptrap.  There was no reason to fly to USA except that she read about this &#8216;doctor&rsquo; on a website and was stupid enough to have the procedure carried out in a hotel room!!  A &#8216;beauty&rsquo; who wanted a bigger butt to match up to the rapper ideal of womanhood?? If you would like to see what her idea of &#8216;beauty&rsquo; is, or was, take a look at this link&hellip;.. Shudder!!!!</p>

		<p>Our health care system is over regulated and costs go are through the roof. If people want to do this sort of thing I say go for it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the point where I think the government should uphold standards for doctors and other healthcare providers but not enforce them, except when your talking facilities for and about non elective/ emergency care. Where that line is drawn is debatable I understand. </p>
<p>Also maybe it&rsquo;s time to do away with prescription drugs and make them all over the counter to lower costs. I&rsquo;m getting tired of the government protecting us from ourselves, and such practices are making life very expensive. <br>
   <br>
When your talking about Medicine that is outside of emergency medicine I think we are going to have to accept that there will be stupid people that will elect for this kind of &#8220;care&#8221; and will die. We can&rsquo;t let the stupid get in the way of lowering heath care costs for everyone else. But I&rsquo;m sure that people like Black Madam will be used as a reason for more government regulation not less and life becomes more expensive for us all because of it. </p>

		<p>Why would any woman in her right mind pay $ 1,800 for a fat derriere? Why don&rsquo;t they get it the old-fashioned way, by eating junk food, cheeseburgers, pizzas and the like?</p>
