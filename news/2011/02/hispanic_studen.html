			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ilana Kowarski, Christian Science Monitor, February 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the College Board&rsquo;s annual report, the &#8220;AP Report to the Nation,&#8221; 14.6 percent of US high school seniors who passed an AP exam in 2010 were Hispanic, an increase of 2.6 percent since 2001. The rise follows an effort by the College Board to recruit more minority students to take the demanding tests.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The increased representation among successful AP test takers by Hispanic students coincides with an even larger increase in their representation in the nation&rsquo;s high school population. {snip}</p>
<p>While the overall number of AP test takers has nearly doubled since 2001, the College Board says, the number of Hispanic AP test takers has nearly tripled, increasing from 48,354 in 2001 to 136,717 in 2010. The number of passing Hispanic test takers grew from 33,479 to 74,479 over that period.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;More work needs to be done&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite their progress, Hispanic students were still somewhat underrepresented among those who passed an AP test last year. While Hispanic students were 14.6 percent of those who passed an AP test, they made up 16 percent of AP test takers overall and 16.8 percent of the graduating high school class of 2010. Some 54.5 percent of all Hispanic test takers passed at least one AP test, compared with 59.6 percent of all students and 61.8 percent of white students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Questions about recruitment</b></p>
<p>The move to increase access to the AP exam has not been without criticism. Robert Schaeffer, public-education director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, says he has reservations about the recruitment campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s questionable whether there&rsquo;s real educational value in getting everybody to take the AP exam even if they are not academically prepared,&#8221; he says in an interview. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not clear that this benefits anyone except for the College Board.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, AP calculus teacher Dixie Ross disagrees. Her school in Pflugerville, Texas, is very diverse, with a third of students identifying themselves as Hispanic and a quarter as African-American, she says. Her classes were once filled almost exclusively with white students but now include more minorities, a change she welcomes. The increased number of minority AP test takers is a sign of progress, Ms. Ross says in an interview. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Students say AP helps</b></p>
<p>Ross says her students have told her that their AP experiences helped them succeed in college, and she says this was even true of some students who did not pass the exam. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Mr. Schaeffer argues that expanding the number of AP test takers has &#8220;diluted the pool&#8221; and produced high failure rates, particularly in math and science. According to the College Board&rsquo;s own report, the percentage of AP test takers who passed a single exam has dipped since 2001, from 64.3 percent to 59.6 percent. The report also acknowledges that more than 50 percent of biology AP test takers fail the exam.</p>

		<p>As a former teacher in a barrio area, I noticed immediately that the first-generation Hispanic students did not do nearly as well as the second-generation Hispanics.  This was true across the board.  It seemed that the second-generation Hispanic kids had parents who had learned the value of learning English and of promoting education as primary with their kids.  It makes a HUGE difference; the first-generation Hispanic kids had parents who thought anyone with schooling beyond the 6th grade was a real educated person, and they saw no reason to learn English when they could get welfare and work as housecleaners and ditchdiggers.  The second generation folks wanted something better than that, so they changed their values.  I suspect these test scores reflect a change in parental values, rather than in the basic smarts of Hispanic kids.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s just more proof that every race on earth outperforms blacks.</p>
<p>The next time they decide to run an article about the black/white achievement gap, I&rsquo;d like to suggest they first talk about the black/Hispanic achievement gap; then the black/Asian gap, then the black/Arab gap, followed by the black/Indian gap.</p>

		<p>I taught for a number of years in a school that was 70% latino and 30% black.  I am not making this up that every black kid was at least 5-6 years behind grade level.  They also caused 90% of the behavior problems in the school.</p>
<p>The average latino student was about 4-5 years behind.  </p>
<p>Most of those were behind because they immigrated from countries where many kids have what the experts call an &#8220;Interrupted Education.&#8221; (SIFE)  In other words, maybe they didn&rsquo;t have Pre-K or KG, but went to grades 1-2, then dropped out for three years.  Then went for grade 5 or 6.  Then they immigrated to this country and enrolled in grade 10, based on their age.</p>
<p>All the alarm in education today.  Really now - all the ALARM is because not only are we dealing with low performance consistently from many black students, but we&rsquo;re IMPORTING poor people from semi-literate societies at the tune of millions each year.</p>
<p>Our schools are being overwhelmed with people who would not normally be in school at this point in their lives.  Our educational system is being bled dry trying to &#8220;bring them up&#8221; to first world standards, acting under the theory that all people are interchangeable.  Then the students leave the student at the end of the day and reenter life in the &#8216;Barrio&rsquo; where all they hear is Spanish and live in Third World ways.</p>
<p>Folks, it ain&rsquo;t workin&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Arne Duncan, Obama and all the rest on the left want to break the teacher unions, not because they want to have &#8216;better&rsquo; teachers, but because they want to freely fire older white teachers.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because the Left thinks that the students need a teacher &#8216;who looks like them&rsquo; and they think this will solve the problem.  Destroy the core of traditional American (white) education and you will unleash the next great black and latino scientist.</p>
<p>The Right wants to break the teacher unions solely for monetary reasons.  They want teachers to be temp workers who make little better than minimum wage and who leave after a couple years.  This lowers the taxes on the rich considerably because no more pensions or high salary teachers.  They rightly don&rsquo;t want to pay too much for educators who will be teaching the common masses, while they (the rich) send their own kids to private school.</p>
<p>Everyone laughs now, but the teachers in this country are demoralized across the board and reduced to fudging grades to save their skins, realizing full well that there is no superman who can save us all and bring up all the &#8216;potential&rsquo; locked inside little Pablo, Marisol, Shaquanda and DeShawn.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re starting to go after university profs now.  What do you think education in America is going to look like in ten years?  Twenty?</p>

		<p>When it comes to our two favorite minorities, there is a lot of informal discussion among educators over &#8220;They can&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t want to&#8221; versus &#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to because they can&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>I lean toward the latter, and see a lot of the macho posturing as a cover for the fact that many of them just aren&rsquo;t very bright and adopt a don&rsquo;t-care attitude to cover their lack of ability; you can&rsquo;t lose if you don&rsquo;t play the game. However, when they stop making excuses and blaming everything on whitey, Latinos are definitely a more capable people than blacks.</p>

		<p> The &#8220;efforts to recruit&#8221; convinced some weaker Hispanic students to take the exam which leads to the results of this study: increase in Hispanics who passed the test, but a lower respective pass rate.  The multiculturalists will likely misinterpret theses results as evidence that Hispanics are getting smarter.</p>
<p>AP exams are pure content exams, which any student with an average memory can succeed.  The results of this study do not show that Hispanics are getting smarter, rather more have committed to memorizing content for and taking AP exams.  The major difference between Whites and Hispanics isn&rsquo;t their capacity for memory, but a gap in their analytic ability which shows up more distinctly on content-blended intelligence tests such as the SAT, LSAT, GRE, etc.</p>

<p>I suspect that&rsquo;s partly because east Asians have higher IQ&rsquo;s, and especially for maths. But mainly because Asians work three times as hard in school, which has been documented many times.</p>
<p>Part of my complaint against some of the commenters here is that they compare themselves to blacks, whom you can never lose to(the average white kid of the underclass, the lowest 20 % in earnings, has higher SAT scores on all subjects than the top 20 % in the black community, children of doctors and lawyers, often being taught in great and expensive schools as compared to the white underclass stuck in public minority-majority schools).</p>
<p>Many people of European origin should start to return to where we once were, serious and studious. It is this that brought Western - European - civilization to the fore.</p>
<p>In the end, however, we will decline and perish if we let it happen. And the staggering difference in drive, ambition and work-ethic between Whites and Asians is just a sad testament to how fall many whites have now fallen to. </p>
<p>I see it in my own school where even the brightest children are &#8216;coolly neglective&rsquo; of school. I have nothing but than dripping acid and cold disdain for these fools, irregardless if they are part of my tribe or not. Especially, perhaps, if they&rsquo;re part of my tribe.</p>

<p>Funny, there are literally thousands of whites in Calculus classes throughout the US and Europe, and a huge number of them excel in math. I wonder what there is about your school that doesn&rsquo;t have whites in math classes?</p>
<p>It is no accident that white societies have surpassed Asian ones for centuries now.</p>

<p>Articles like this are always disingenuous and misleading, the main purpose to demean White students rather than praise hispanics.  From reading the headline, one might assume that hispanics are &#8220;catching up&#8221; to Whites in AP passing rates.  This is hardly the case (remember a 3 is a passing score).</p>
<p><i>The tremendous growth from 1998 to 2008 in Hispanics taking AP tests drove down their average score on the 1 to 5 scale from 2.99 to 2.42. Their passing rate dipped from 60 percent 42 percent.</i></p>
<p>Indeed, 56 percent of all 5s earned by Hispanics in 2008 came on the Spanish Language exam&hellip;Excluding it, Latinos in 2008 averaged a 2.17 score with a 35 percent passing rate.</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/3a4uwdm</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the rate of Whites taking the Physics I or II, Calculus AB/BC or Bio APs who pass compared to hispanics who pass.  I can&rsquo;t seem to find any statistics on that&hellip;</p>

<p>Funny, the top students in my son&rsquo;s Physics II and Calculus BC class are White, in fact he tutors Algebra II and Calculus AB and tells me there are Asians in the tutoring sessions.  Calculus was, after all, discovered by Whites as was 97% of the sciences.</p>
<p><i>Charles Murray catalogued man&rsquo;s accomplishments according to the number of times they were cited by others. Over 97% of the most important scientists and 74% of the most important artists and authors were white, almost all males, and most from only four countries, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy the remainder were mostly Asian, and none were African.</i></p>

<p>Not True.   ONE component of the AP exam is content, there is also a Free Response section (known as the FRQ) as well on ALL of the APs including Calculus, Chemistry and Physics.  The history exams have DBQs or Data Based Questions, where students are given a set of historical documents to synthesize and analyze and then must generate a response to a prompt in a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>The College Board, which sponsors the test, states the following on its site:</p>
<p><i>For each AP course,  except for AP Studio Art   &mdash;   which is a portfolio assessment   &mdash;   each AP Exam contains a free-response section (either essay or problem-solving) and a section of multiple-choice questions.</i> </p>
<p>See here for last year&rsquo;s (released) FRQ for Calculus AB, which requires a written answer:</p>
