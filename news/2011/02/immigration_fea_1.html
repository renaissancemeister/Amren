	<p>Teenagers are more worried about immigration than ever before amid dire job news for their age group and beliefs that jobs are going to foreign workers</p>
<p>Fears over immigration have increased among young people  &mdash;  amid dire jobs news for their age group.</p>
<p>More than 70 per cent of those in their late teens and early 20s now say immigration is a problem, according to pollsters Ipsos MORI.</p>
<p>That figure has risen by 10 per cent over the 12 months that saw unemployment among the young approach one million.</p>
<p>For the first time, people in the 16-24 age group are now more worried about migrant numbers than those in their 30s, the poll showed.</p>
<p>Last week it was revealed 965,000 young people are out of work and hundreds of thousands have never worked. One in five 16-24 year-olds is jobless and looking for work.</p>
<p>The poll found almost half of youngsters believe immigration into Britain will damage the economic recovery by taking jobs away from those already here.</p>
<p>Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, said: &#8216;The research shows strong support for tougher immigration policies, and high levels of concern.</p>
<p>&#8216;Concern among young people about immigration has also increased and that could be attributed to the high levels of youth unemployment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Across the country, three quarters of Britons say immigration is a problem. Almost two thirds  &mdash;  65 per cent  &mdash;  want tougher controls on those coming into the country.</p>
<p>More than half (57 per cent) support the Government&rsquo;s immigration cap on non-EU migrant workers, and just 15 per cent are opposed.</p>
<p>Some 68 per cent of 25-39 year-olds said immigration was a big problem, compared to three quarters of those aged 40-64 and 86 per cent of those aged 65 and over.</p>
<p>The poll of more than 1,000 Britons revealed varying reasons for concerns. More than four out of ten people were worried about the burden on public services.</p>
<p>Many youngsters believe that migrants are taking jobs away from British workers and this will in turn damage the economic recovery</p>
<p>Nearly one in three highlighted job fears and a quarter pointed to a general failure in recent years to control migrant numbers.</p>
<p>Last week ministers laid out details of the new cap on non-EU workers, which comes into force from April 6. It will restrict to 21,700 the number allowed in each year.</p>
<p>Ministers hope the changes, with a clampdown on bogus students, will help cut net migration levels from more than 200,000-a-year now to &#8216;tens of thousands&rsquo; by 2015.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Brits 16-24 are more worried about immigrant numbers than those in their 30s.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is people in this age group, that are texting each other via phones, etc., who are rising up against this present economic debacle of rising food and energy costs, and few prospects of getting a job, as in Greece now and the rest of Europe in the immediate future.  The elitist&rsquo;s insane immigration policies aggravate the employment situation.  In Some countries, like Spain, the unemployment rate among young people is about 50%.</p>
<p>The Mideast riots are mostly youths fed up with the same things.  The out-of-touch MSM think these violent rebellions are because the people want democracy, but that&rsquo;s not the reason at all.  They want a job, lower prices for groceries and more pay than $2 per day, so they can feed themselves adequately.  They&rsquo;re also sick and tired of the sharp delineation between what they have&hellip;which is getting less&hellip;and those in gated communities who are actually getting wealthier.  They hate their dictator of choice, because he keeps them down, while catering to the wealthy, of whom he is one as well.</p>
<p>Europe and the US bailed out the bankers, but have sorely neglected the people and people are beginning to wake up to the fact that it is these same Wall Street types who are causing the stock markets to rise.  The common man, for the most part, has little to do right now with buying and selling stocks.  The wealthy are getting wealthier from taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Whether the cause will be higher oil prices or higher food prices and inflation in general, the disaffected communities are set to erupt when the situation gets too much to bear.</p>
<p>Europe is America&rsquo;s canary in the coal mine.</p>

		<p>Why does it shock anyone that 1:  People know (not think) that there is an immigration problem.  And 2:  It will be the youth that notices first.  Who do you think is forced to interact with the new immigrants on a daily basis the most?  I have stopped closing every post with my favorite quote, but am closing with it on this one because it is so relevant.</p>

		<p>The reason there is so much immigration is because businesses are under pressure to compete against the lower labor costs of developing countries. As the number of immigrants grows so does the supply of labor. An increase in supply means a decrease in price (or wages). Businesses love this (and actually lobby the government for more of the same) because it reduces their labor costs and pads their profits. </p>
<p>Of course, many of those immigrants are also getting gov subsidies ie they&rsquo;re on the dole, welfare, etc. So it&rsquo;s basically a case of subsidizing (labor) costs while privatizing (corporate) profits. And raising taxes to pay for the welfare state doesn&rsquo;t exactly help grow the economy, either. So all they&rsquo;re really doing is importing poverty while crippling their economy through taxes and putting their own people out of work. It&rsquo;s economic cannibalism at its worst.</p>
<p>If anyone wanted to know why the gap between the wealthy and the working/middle class is growing that&rsquo;s the reason.</p>

<p>The good news is that there doesn&rsquo;t have to be &#8220;pressure&#8221; from the &#8220;lower labor costs of developing countries.&#8221;  </p>
<p>One word:  Tariffs.</p>

<p>Tariffs have been a contributing cause to almost every war I can think of. </p>
<p>I also believe that tariffs hurt real wages. A Tariff barrier might raise wages 5% but then the things you pay for cost 10% more as businesses can raise the price of product.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the greatest myths out there is that big businesses always argue for less regulation and tariffs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t have free trade and border control. If &#8220;there is so much immigration is because businesses are under pressure to compete against the lower labor costs of developing countries.&#8221;, let the big CEO&rsquo;s move their factory and family to the third world. People in developing countries deserve an opportunity to create a better life for themselves, just not at our expense (immigration)</p>

		<p>HERE HERE. TomSwift I totally agree with your policy prescription. I&rsquo;m just not sure about tariffs being a major contributing factor to EVERY war, probably usually one of many more important factors at most I imagine.</p>

Parliament and the London banks are using an assembly line process to amalgamate England.</p>
<p>It doesnt matter if their objectives are for a good cause or a bad one because the outcome will be the same.</p>
<p>London Banks + Parliament + Main Stream Media = Assembly Line Crisis.</p>
<p>The math is the same in America.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve + Politicians + MSM = Assembly Line Crisis.</p>
<p>Listen, rights come from God.                                  If anyone benefits from this situation, it&rsquo;s not us.</p>

<p>Most countries have tariffs on most goods from most other countries.  Under your logic, most countries in the world should perpetually be at war with every other country.</p>

		<p>This item, from the BNP web site, to whose complete truth I can - as a Londoner born and bred - fully attest, shows exactly the virtually irreversible destruction that two or three decades of open-door mass immigration from the Third World can do to the established culture and identity of a First World capital city:</p>
<p>http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/cockneys-have-become-first-british-group-be-ethnically-cleansed</p>
<p>By the way, the figure of thirty years for the complete disappearance of the Cockney accent is predicated solely on the fact that the last generation to speak with it, uncontaminated by any other influences, will presumably mostly be dead by then. Even now, Cockneys (or those who speak with other working-class London accents, similar to but distinct from real Cockney) are a rapidly dwindling minority in London.</p>
