		<p> Yes, the Left&rsquo;s agenda is oppression. Anyone who follows the news and hasn&rsquo;t caught on to that yet is either willfully blind or hopelessly stupid.</p>
<p> I know this has been repeated over and over in various wordings, but can you imagine the mainstream media&rsquo;s reaction if White city councilmen had muscled a major hotel into cancelling the reservations for a convention of the NAACP, or the Black Muslims? There would be a national scandal   &mdash;   naturally. In the case of American Renaissance, the only place I have been able to find any mention of this atrocity is on AmRen&rsquo;s own website, in the Charlotte Observer, and a couple of TV news sites from that immediate area. Even Fox News, much maligned by the Left as being a mouthpiece for the Right, has not deigned   &mdash;   or perhaps, not dared   &mdash;   to touch the story.</p>
<p> No wonder we White people are losing out, slowly but surely, in this country. There are too many of us who are unwilling, or are too afraid, to stand up for ourselves.</p>

<p>Whites have been a minority in some neighborhoods until there aren&rsquo;t any whites anymore. They&rsquo;ve been a minority in many school districts and workplace and parts of town, and now in most major cities. They are a minority in 2 states now. Those are the places authorities are especially concerned with sensitivity and diversity. The authorities are extra concerned for people of color those places, too. </p>

		<p>&#8220;the lefts agenda is repression&#8221;</p>
<p>It may be another 40 years or more (hopefully less) but I do think whites will have their own country. As our dwindling numbers, and extinction, become more and more inevitable white women will vote against it. About the only thing we can do now is keep track of the most enthusiastic among these anti-white actors, much the way Nazi prison guards were kept track of and the way leftists themselves finger those they don&rsquo;t like, the way they&rsquo;re doing now. Which one of us would want these characters to stay in our new country long? While individuals must compile the tally now, at some point we&rsquo;ll need to be more vocal about it. If that&rsquo;s called &#8216;repression&rsquo; so be it. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get equal rights only if we start rioting and burning down cities.  When blacks and Chicanos are in power the repression will be far worse than it is now.<br>

		<p>Now that whites have been shoved aside in the professional occupatuons, America&rsquo;s economy isn&rsquo;t doing so well, is it? A mere 13 years ago, when America&rsquo;s IT sector was 98% white American males, rhe U.?s economy was booming. Now that the flood of faking 3rd world H-1B workers has taken over and shoved whites aside, the economy is a disaster. Import a 3rd world workforce, you get a 3rd world economy.</p>
<p>What is even more astounding is that nearly every modern invention including the TV, radio, PC, and internet were all invented by whites. Where would the world be without the inventions of whites? Can someone name one new industry or invention invented by say, China, India, or Mexico? How about Brazil or Venezuela? I thought so. When whites are finally shoved out of the picture altogether, let&rsquo;s see wnat the world is like. Indeed it has already begun: the slide into totalitarianism and chaos.</p>

		<p>The US is a de facto totalitarian &#8220;Cultural Marxist&#8221; State.</p>

&#8220;To be immersed in the Department for any length of time is to know with absolute certainty that the battle of ideas, for the highest seat of power, for the basic outlook of the United States of America is over and it has been won by globalist, multi-culturalist, liberal capitalism. That is to say, the USG is currently fanatically devoted to a world-view that can best be described in shorthand as a mix between the Wall St Journal pro-global business and open borders stance and the ideology one would find in the Office for Multi-Cultural Affairs at a major liberal arts university.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mencius Moldbug (whose father was in the Foreign Service, and as he once pointed out to Larry Auster, when a person IN the Foreign Service and a person who grew up in the Foreign Service are telling you, who are NOT in USG that USG is fully and completely committed to the modern liberal revolution and is not capable of being reformed, one should LISTEN) is completely correct in noting that this view has hardened into an ideology and has intertwined itself so thoroughly in the popular mind with what it means to be &ldquo;American&rdquo; that nothing short of an intense crisis or a complete breakdown will bring about any change. Certainly, electing this or that Republican makes no difference to the Permanent Government.&#8221;<br>

		<p>There has to be a way for Mr. Taylor to get some more national exposure. I am an Atheist and Dawkins and Hitchens have done a great job with debates and such. Maybe Mr. Taylor could start issuing challenges to debates ? I would love to see a debate series between him and Tim Wise. Mr. Wise is a publicity whore and will do and say anything to be in the public eye.</p>
<p>Challenge him Mr. Taylor the Left maybe many things but one thing the are very much is arrogant. I could see one of them taking the bait. </p>

		<p>If you stand for white interests, either implicitly like the Ron Paul wing of the tea-party movement, or explicitly, it does not matter how articulate you are, your academic credentials, your unwillingness to raise your voice or use the N or J words. The system is going to give you no more consideration than if you were standing on the courthouse steps behind police barriers in your mis-matched SA uniforms with a bullhorn. You had better accept that if you stand for European, Christian values, you are an enemy of the state and you will be treated accordingly.</p>
<p>You can forget freedom of speech, or in fact any of the constitution as originally written. You are an outlaw and beyond the pale. There is no equal time, no civil rights, no respect and no dignity. You can expect to lose your job and some of your acquaintances. If you appear in public, obscenity-spewing &#8220;students&#8221; along with mindless socialist thugs will try to attack you&hellip;and the police will watch. If you successfully defend yourself physically, expect to be arrested&hellip;and spat upon as they push you into the back of a squadrol. In jail, expect the worst and prepare for it. In court, expect a kangaroo show trial and a stiff punishment or sentence.</p>
<p>Welcome to the revolution my friends. </p>

<p>In 2005, Mr. Taylor debated Mr. Wise on the merits of diversity. I thought it was a good and civil debate, in which each party expressed his views well. It&rsquo;s available as an mp3 download from this website. </p>
