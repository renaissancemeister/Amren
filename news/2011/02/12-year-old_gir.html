<h1>12-Year-Old Girl Punched in Face During Alleged Bullying Attack</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WMUR-TV (Manchester, New Hampshire), February 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Manchester woman says her 12-year-old daughter was the victim of extreme bullying at McLaughlin Middle School in Manchester.</p>
<p>Morgan Graveline is recovering after she said a boy at her school punched out her two front teeth.</p>
<p>The attack came two weeks after Graveline said she was hit in the face by the boy&rsquo;s friend on the school bus.</p>
<p>The girl told WMUR on Saturday night that she had just gone to her principal and guidance counselor to report threats from the boys.</p>
<p>Now, Graveline&rsquo;s mother, Danielle Gauthier, is calling for the removal [of] her daughter&rsquo;s Principal at McLaughlin Middle School.</p>
<p>Gauthier said a bus driver reported the initial school bus attack, but she said the principal never made her aware.</p>
<p>&#8220;My jaw hurts all along this line, and right here hurts, my nose hurts really bad, my teeth hurt, my lips hurt,&#8221; Graveline said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The sixth grader said she was attacked Tuesday in her school cafeteria, by a boy she describes as a muscular 14-year-old who she said had been threatening her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do remember his first punch and then I don&rsquo;t know, and then he just kept hitting me,&#8221; said Graveline.</p>
<p>Morgan is now forced to eat from a straw for at least the next month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s family is furious, especially they say, finding out after the attack that Morgan had been hit by that boy&rsquo;s friend on her school bus two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s mother said she&rsquo;s deeply concerned that Morgan herself went to both her Principal, and to her guidance counselor, but her family was never notified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really upset cause they kept threatening me that they were going to beat me up and stuff like that so I was like alright, I&rsquo;m just going to go to the principal to see if he can do anything about it,&#8221; said Morgan.</p>

								<h2>My 12 Year Old Daughter Brutally Attacked by Refugee Boys at School</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Blog of Morgan Graveline&rsquo;s Mother, February 19, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>McLaughlin Middle school in Manchester, NH. She has always been a well liked girl with lots of friends, and a passion for humanity. She&rsquo;s known for standing up for those who can&rsquo;t stand up for themselves giving them a voice and the courage to stand up for themselves.</p>
<p>It came as complete shock when our family received a call from the school nurse stating that Morgan had been involved in a fight and &#8220;her mouth is a little screwed up&#8221;. Upon arriving at her school it was very disturbing to see her condition. Immediately we knew by the blood gushing and her inability to remember her mothers name or phone numbers, she should have been transported to the ER by ambulance. Instead, she sitting in the nurses office being asked to stop crying. Stop crying about the teeth that had been punched out of her head?</p>
<p>Apparently two weeks prior to my daughter getting attacked at school, she was punched in the face by one of the boys on the bus. Being too scared to tell anyone, my daughter never spoke to myself or our family about this incident only telling her sister what had happened. The bus driver however was well aware of what happened, and reported it a WEEK LATER. Meanwhile she is receiving threats from these boys that they are going to &#8220;f**k up her face so she isn&rsquo;t pretty anyone&#8221;.</p>
<p>The arguments between my daughter and these boys started with a couple of the boys asking Morgan to be their girlfriend. When Morgan turned them down, they retaliated by calling her names like &#8220;fat ho, lesbian b**ch, c**t, etc .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; this goes on for about a month before the first assault on the bus occurs.</p>
<p>Once the principal received notification about the bus incident, he took another week to address it. Not once was I ever notified that my daughter was assaulted on the bus. The principal questioned my daughter and the boys that had been threatening her. The boys were never suspended or removed from school. Shortly after the conversation the students had with the principal, Morgan was brutally attacked. First elbowed in the face, followed by 6 to 7 punches knocking her front teeth out and leaving her with a concussion. It took four teachers to get one of the boys off her.</p>
<p>Adding further negligence to her care, the nurse put her teeth in water which significantly reduces the chance of being able to save the teeth. Even I know having no medical background, you&rsquo;re suppose to put a tooth in milk. As if she wasn&rsquo;t in enough pain, due to the teeth not being put in milk she had to have the teeth put back into her mouth with out any pain killers because of emergency of time. The dentist said this was the worst trauma she&rsquo;s seen to a child&rsquo;s mouth. If the teeth end up taking, which there is a 80% chance they won&rsquo;t, she will have to have at least four root canals among other reconstructive procedures. In the meantime she has to eat from a straw for the next month and possibly two.</p>
<p>When I asked the principal why he didn&rsquo;t tell me of the incident on the bus two weeks prior his response was &#8220;I have things to do and other people to talk to&#8221; followed by a condescending chuckle! This was his response to parent in tears at ER with her daughter.</p>
<p>I firmly believe if I had been notified of the first incident, the attack that followed could have been prevented. There would have been many steps I could have taken to prevent this, such as removing her from the bus and working closely with the school. My sister, along with my mother were the first to arrive at the school and were greeted by the Vice Principal saying &#8220;there are two sides to every story&#8221; in response to asking what action is being taken against the boys.</p>
<p>The boys are refugees brought over from Kenya and Ethiopia. It makes me question if we are providing these children with proper coping skills for a healthy transition. Also, is it safe for these students to be held back to due to language barriers leaving such a great age difference between students. I can&rsquo;t imagine the rage these boys must be harvesting inside to attack a girl so brutally.</p>
<p>This incident happened on Tuesday February 15th, I have called the police department numerous times with no luck. I asked the police to come take a statement from my daughter. He responded with I already spoke with her and have all the information I need. The officer NEVER spoke to my daughter. These officers are also the ones that are employed by the school to be on the premises at all times. When I tried to contact the Manchester Police department directly to get someone to take a report, I was repeatedly told &#8220;I&rsquo;ll hear from someone&#8221;.</p>
<p>Today is Saturday February 19th, I still have not heard from anyone. The school has not called to see how Morgan is doing. It breaks my heart that a little girl can be so brutally attacked by boys at school, and this is how the situation was handled.<br>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this predicted on AmRen comments, and we assume that the posters weren&rsquo;t SPLC-ADL trolls looking to get us shut down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s come to this: a White girl who denies a black is rightful &#8220;equality justice through the White womb,&#8221; she deserves to get beaten by his black hands.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re surprised he beat her without raping her first.  Blacks are taught to hate Whites, and White skin is &#8220;consent&#8221; to diversity sex.  A black cannot rape a White, by definition, because forced black on White sex is &#8220;the consent of unearned White privilege to being equalized with those whom Whites have oppressed and marginalized&#8221;.</p>
<p>We pray for this dear White child, but we also hope that she becomes a victim martyr and all Whites would speak her name with reverence and as a warning to themselves.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight: a 12 year old GIRL is assaulted without provocation by either a Kenyan or Ethiopian REFUGEE in New Hampshire, a fairly cold (temperature-wise), and one of the &#8220;least diverse&#8221; (i.e., mostly white, states in the Union?  Who is the genius who thought this scenario up?</p>

		<p>All of these types of incidents are going to get more and more numerous until, hopefully, a tipping point is reached.  At that point, once again, hopefully Whites will begin to wake up en masse.  I keep using the word &#8220;hopefully&#8221; as cautious optimism.  An awakening can&rsquo;t be guaranteed.  Just look at South Africa.  The remaining Whites there are being genocided and they are, by and large, letting it happen.  Here is a great youtube video that depicts exactly what is happening.  The young guy in the video is lucky he wasn&rsquo;t seriously hurt.</p>

<p>This truly sickens me.</p>

		<p>This is nothing.  This is just a tiny hint of what is to come.  Remember, these foreign invaders are still a little nervous   &mdash;   at present, they are only 10-20% of the overall population of England.  Just imagine when they are 60 or 80% of the population, and the hated Whites are only 20%.  That is when their true behavior will emerge.  </p>
<p>One can get an idea of what life in England will be like in the future, by simply looking at what life is like back in the Congo, or Zimbabwe, or Rwanda RIGHT NOW.  We can expect tens of  thousands of raped women, children, and babies.  some will be sexually  mutilated during or after the rapes    &mdash;   piles and piles of hacked off arms, feet, noses, ears, and heads, churches full of people burned to death.  </p>
<p>You say I&rsquo;m extreme?  But these things have already happened, and happen regularly, and continue to happen wherever Africans congregate.  How can you deny these things will NOT happen, when they are happening right now in Africa?  How can you say I&rsquo;m wrong when Blacks already rape 35,000 White women and girls annually in the USA (and Whites rape ~ 10 - 100 Black Women annually in the USA).  This is the future our &#8220;dear leaders&#8221; have planned for us.   </p>

<p>Poor girl I hope those teeth are saved. These refugees have only succeeded in guaranteeing an entire school of white girls who&rsquo;ll never date a black guy.</p>

		<p>It sounds to me like the attackers are being protected because they are wards of a church group or some other refugee sponsoring agency.</p>
<p>I urge all members of this forum to call the media, write letters, and keep the pressure on for some justice to be done.</p>

<p>Even after her daughter has been beaten by Africans, she still feels the need to publicly agonize over whether or not &#8220;these boys&#8221; are being treated with sufficient reverence by a school system that displays utter indifference to attacks against White students.  Apparently, Politically Correct Sensitivity trumps even the safety of her children. </p>
<p>And we wonder why it continues, day after day, year after year.  Pathetic.<br>

		<p>This is a totally sickening and disgusting episode. The school response is just so typical. When one of my daughters was seriously bashed at a high school I just received similar lame duck excuses for inaction. When I threatened to make it a police matter, eg common assult, the deputy principal said please don&rsquo;t, as the people who bashed your daughter are poor underprivileged housing department kids etc etc! Now it looks like we will having the &#8220;poor underprivileged&#8221; refugee excuse for schoolyard violence.</p>
<p>When are we going to wake up to this madness of importing refugees who will never fit in to, contribute to or adapt to the American or Australian way of life.I call it multicultural insanity!</p>
<p>I also look with some wonder at the name of the area where this all too common act brutality took place. That is Manchester, New Hampshire, I have never been there but it is a name that suggests a very English community going back to the earliest days of white settlement in North America. Perhaps this is the sort of heritage and history that should be taught in our schools a bit more often instead of black history and diversity studies.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Graveline, No one in authority cares about you or your White daughter.  You don&rsquo;t have the correct skin color. You are not among the privileged races.  The authorities will not help you.  You have to find ways to protect your family, yourself.  Can you join with your extended family   &mdash;   you kin?  Will they help protect your family?  Can you move to a White community? </p>
<p>My heartfelt sympathies to your daughter and you.  I hope that she will not be scarred for life by this brutal attack.  <br>

		<p>This is just sickening! Two sides to every story!? This was a brutal attack on a young girl by several older and much larger thugs. I have to put the girl&rsquo;s parents to blame partially though. If she had informed them of the ongoing harassment and they had responded by removing her from the bus after nothing was done she would not be in the state she is in now. That school nurse should immediately be relieved of duty- no further action would be appropriate- she endangered this girl&rsquo;s life by not contacting emergency care and yelled at her to quit crying about her missing teeth. It is not stated whether the administrators are black but my guess is that they are either black or are so self hating of their own white race that they will side with blacks every time. I can only hope that the mom has enough sense to remove her daughter and teach her at home or enroll her in a private school.</p>

		<p>I first saw this story on Fox News last night.  The anchor spent several minutes discussing the story, even speaking with the young female victim on the air, and going on and on about &#8216;bullying&rsquo; without describing much of what happened.  The lack of details and the total lack of description of her attackers suggested (as it always does) that this was indeed a sexually motivated black-on-white crime.  Not surprised at all to see the truth here today&hellip;</p>

		<p>White people must understand that these refusals are very offensive to black people and can no longer be tolerated. Blacks feel that it is not only offensive but amazing that white people object to mixing with blacks. Clearly blacks see this a positive for whites.  And it seems that they see it  no other way, no matter what white may say.</p>
<p>Here, from my favorite humor magazine, The Root, Feb 4th 2011 a report on this issue:     <br>
 &hellip;.      Straight from our &#8220;Oh really, you say racism doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore? Really?!&#8221; file, BV Black Spin reports that the father of a 12-year-old white girl in rural Alabama has been threatening black male students from the local basketball team who interact with her.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the man stormed the gym and threatened violence if they made any contact with his daughter.</p>
<p>Read the full story and watch the video on BV Black Spin.</p>
<p><br>
In black eyes clear proof of white racism.  How could they see it as otherwise - or so they think.</p>

		<p>This is so infuriating.I know I&rsquo;m not supposed to make insulting comments on this page. However this is what happens when anti white garbage get put in a position to brainwash students and their parents. I suppose some kind of sensitivity training will be on the menu to figure out a way to make poor Morgan Graveline feel guilty and be more tolerant the next time she gets beat up.T olerance now means being friends with and worshiping minorities whether you like it or not. Be my friend or I&rsquo;ll knock your teeth out. &#8220;The boys are refugees brought over from Kenya and Ethiopia. It makes me question if we are providing these children with proper coping skills for a healthy transition&#8221;. What next? I guess providing them with a steady supply of white victims is a way to help them &#8220;cope&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Forget the schools.  They&rsquo;re no help.  They want us to go away and keep quiet.  You have to call the police, go to the ER.  Keep going to the police.  Hire lawyers and go after the school and the boys&rsquo; families if they have any assets.  Maybe the feds would be interested in helping.  They&rsquo;re so into civil rights these days.  </p>

		<p>A similar incident happened last July in France.  A white teenage girl was walking on the sidewalk in Paris when a group of black males approached her asking for her number.  The white girl refused at which point one of the black males slapped her hard across the face.  They laughed as she walked away holding her hand against her face.  The incident was recorded on video, unfortunately it was taken down from the internet and hasn&rsquo;t been reposted.</p>
<p>I sympathize with white girls/women who are approached alone by black males.  You are in a potentially deadly situation if you refuse them.  They have an entitlement complex, white women are the prize they have been waiting to get their hands on since they were children.  Refuse them.</p>

White kids sometimes strike eachother with punishing blows that expose neglect by parents and a schools faculty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when whites put blacks in the same classrooms with their kids that the level of violence will find a new low.</p>
<p>The British won&rsquo;t learn their lesson about the importance of segregation until they are squared up and standing toe-to-toe with a black nation at home.</p>
<p>No one wants that to be the case.<br>
But if it is,it will prove to them that America&rsquo;s founding fathers were right about them.</p>

		<p>This mother needs to sue the school, the gardian of the African thugs, but ESPECIALLY the church or organization that sponsored the importation of these criminals into the community.  </p>
<p>If my pitbull gets out and bites someone, I get sued.  If I am neglegent and let my old tree rot and fall on someone, I am responsible.  If I import foreign criminals and release them into a local school where they can prey upon children, then I should pay for the damages.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to what the reaction would be if a group such as the Pagans or Warlock motorcycle gangs descended on the the black perpetrators and chain-whipped and stomped them half to death, then went after their guttersnipe parents. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I live in school district that&rsquo;s 70 percent Asian(some of those south Asians are darker than blacks). Even talking back to a teacher will get a student suspended in our local schools- Please don&rsquo;t lump all minorities with you-know-who. If America goes back to segregation as white slowly wake up, I&rsquo;m afraid for my children and grand children being forced to go to school with blacks because they have dark skin. Those Blacks would literally eat us alive for being smart and docile.</p>

		<p>This child was afraid to tell her parents that she was harassed on the bus. WHY???? I have to ask myself.  Because they were black, and in her pure do gooder heart they are so oppresssed by bad white people and can not do any wrong,  and those bleeding hearts are so self righteous that a child is left alone with such a dangerous situation. In my opinion those parents, at least the mother, share a mega slice of responsibility for what happened to their daughter.   I was expecting the mealy mouthed, liberal comment  if we do enough to help those boys make the transition. Someone send this idiot woman a hammer so she can hit herself on the head with it.

		<p>I agree with #19. Anonymous. And I think the girls mother should push for criminal charges to be filed against the boys, insisting this be labeled for what it is - a racially motivated attack so that they are charged with a HATE CRIME - though fat chance of that happening. And then bring civil suits against the principal, bus driver and guidance counselor who failed to act or notify her parents. And the nurse who put her teeth in water and not milk should be charged with criminal negligence if the transplants don&rsquo;t take. These were this girl&rsquo;s permanent front teeth! The lack of caring by the school personnel is disgusting. </p>
<p>I especially love #19.&rsquo;s inclusion in the lawsuit of whatever organization sponsored these cretins immigration to our country. Hopefully Ms. Gauthier will sue them all and win, and the boys will be held criminally responsible. I wish Morgan Graveline a speedy recovery physically. Mentally it will take her a lot longer. She was badly let down by the adults at her school. <br>

		<p>Proof positive why white children must never be in the same schools as non-whites, they are merely prey sexually or otherwise. Had this been my daughter, those thugs would find out how many punches an enraged white man can inflict before he kills them. That is the only way we can protect our children, by killing or beating to within an inch of their lives any and everyone who dares to attack our kids. When they know they will have more to fear from the father than the police, schools will become what they are supposed to be, centers of learning. Until that happens, they will be ever more dangerous and violent racial war zones for whites.</p>

		<p>One of the comments posted with the original article suggests this girl&rsquo;s mother report this incident to the Nancy Grace show so she could feature it. How naive can these people be? I would be shocked if she would run this story. Nancy Grace is part of the liberal mass media that runs from publicizing crimes when the victims are white and the perpetrators are black.</p>
<p>For a few nights at the end of December 2010 Nancy Grace reported on a 12 year old white boy who disappeared, then whose badly burned body was found in a ravine at the side of the road that turned out to be the missing Jonathan Foster. When it came to light a day later that a black woman was arrested for his murder, because she was filmed by a security camera from a nearby building dumping his body, Nancy Grace&rsquo;s coverage of the story abruptly stopped. I read of the arrest of Mona Yvette Nelson from an alternate news source - Nancy Grace&rsquo;s show didn&rsquo;t even have the decency to report that a suspect had been found, let alone arrested. And this poor child was incinerated with a blow torch. The Houston Texas police detective said it was one of the most horrific murders he could recall. And not a peep out of any of our major news networks.  </p>

When it comes to blacks, absence makes the heart grow fond. Whites who have the least contact with blacks generally are the whites who have the highest opinion of them. These whites find it easy to forgive blacks for their behavior, unless it happens to them. Then they have an epiphany. </p>

		<p>A few thoughts:</p>
<p>1) If anyone directly involved in this case - a friend, relative, whatever - is reading these comments, then I beg you please, please, please ask Morgan if ANY racial epithets at all were said to her by the bullies who have been harassing her. I don&rsquo;t just mean by the boy when he attacked her, but at any point in the past few weeks when this group of black boys have been bothering her. Have they ever said &#8220;white&#8221; this or &#8220;white&#8221; that? Anything? It&rsquo;s important. If they have, then again, PLEASE speak loudly and clearly and demand that this get treated as a racially motivated attack. A hate crime.</p>
<p>We all know that race is in play here, and we also all know that unless someone makes a big stink about it, the racial angle will get swept under the rug. And once again, at year&rsquo;s end, hate crimes against whites will go under-reported because we are not a protected, special group. If the racial elements in an incident like this go unreported, then imagine how many less severe incidents go unreported. Hate crime stats are a joke. Cases like this prove it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Next comment: WHERE&rsquo;S THAT &#8220;WHITE PRIVILEGE&#8221; AGAIN? </p>
<p>Where did it go? Anyone seen it lately?</p>
<p></p>
<p>3) I&rsquo;m no one in this movement, just another internet commenter&hellip; but I have to say, that if I had the means to be an activist, this is the sort of place I would be focusing my efforts.</p>
<p>What if there was a national group fronted by a handful of articulate presentable spokespeople, both men and women, who were ready as these incidents arose to go on local TV, or if possible, national TV to talk about the plight of white victims of interracial crimes and demand justice?</p>
<p>Meanwhile activists behind the scenes could be gathering data and releasing press releases targeted at every major media outlet. There could be regional groups with phone trees of activists prepared to send out a dozen or so people with signs to show up at schools, police stations and city halls demanding equal protection for white kids and white victims of interracial crime in general. Signs saying &#8220;Stop Hate Crimes Against Whites,&#8221; &#8220;Equal Justice for White Victims of Racist Violence&#8221; etc. Heck, if you really want to stir the pot, send a determined group of demonstrators into the black part of town and demand that the black community stop preying on whites. That would get news - and A LOT of sympathetic white people would take notice, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>White Victims of Interracial Crime. The group could have a name like that. Plus there could be a fund that would help white victims get medical care, psychological help. And a legal aid network that could pursue civil lawsuits and get settlements for the victims. </p>
<p>You get the idea. I know it&rsquo;s a pipe dream, but what do you think?</p>
<p>This is an issue that lends itself towards waking up the racial awareness of white people. Most whites are already on our side.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about teaching that attracts mentally ill radicals like the ones running that school. But they would have to be mentally ill to behave the way they did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Refugees&#8221; like that should be deported. Indeed, they shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed in the first place. Now, it remains for those to go not only get a lawyer and go after the boys but after the principal as well. The school board won&rsquo;t do anything until someone brings the heat on them. Then they&rsquo;ll throw the principal under the bus to make it go away.</p>
<p>As others have said, a church probably sponsored them. The parents should address that as well. The parents shouldn&rsquo;t stop with a conversation with the church&rsquo;s leaders because they&rsquo;ll try to sweep it under the rug. The girl&rsquo;s parents need to get a group together and make the congregation of that church aware of what its leaders are doing. The congregation should also be urged to withhold tithes until their leaders get their act together.</p>
<p>One should realize, however, that the leaders of that church won&rsquo;t give up this nonsense lightly. They may be the ones sponsoring the refugees but they are getting taxpayer dollars from the government for doing it. They serve Mammon.</p>

If this girl was in the countries that these black thugs came from she would already be a Muslim wife with a kid or two and she would be just one of several wives to some black man.

		<p>Sorry to say, but without something radical changing - mostly likely from activists - nothing will change as a result of this.</p>
<p>The brainwashing of whites has been so severe and so successful that they have surrendered vast regions of America already, and most of our major cities.</p>
<p>This will be viewed as &#8216;isolated&rsquo; and &#8216;unfortunate&rsquo;. And brainwashed whites will think their response (and even the actual solution) should be to do even more to &#8216;reach out&rsquo; and &#8216;welcome&rsquo; these nonwhites. </p>
<p>They will view the violence of the nonwhites as being their own failure.</p>
<p>And anyone who dares speak the truth of what the situation really is, will be viewed as somehow more of a danger than the actual violent nonwhites - as if it were our &#8216;attitudes&rsquo; that were the root cause of the violence.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t think it is an impossible level of brainwashing to overcome, it is certainly not going to be an easy one to figure out how to counter. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has figured out a way yet.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I was watching a &#8220;movie&#8221; about the rape and murder of a little black girl by white thugs in the South. It was a very touching story so I decided to see if the story was in any way real. A little research and I found the story line to be totally fictional, it wasn&rsquo;t even based on an actual even. </p>
<p>The problem with the relationship between blacks and whites is that our world is a fabrication made by those Judas Goats in Hollywood. All the violence that most people ever see or notice is in the movies and that violence is directed against blacks by white people. </p>
<p>If those criminals in Hollywood wanted to make a real informative movie there would be a remake of &#8221; Birth of a Nation&#8221;. But then again a movie is banned if it tells the truth.</p>

Now we can&rsquo;t do that we live the way others want us to live as we serve up to them our freedoms and country.<br>
They don&rsquo;t come and take it from us, we willingly allow the foulest of thoughts and ideas to exist among these newcomers and we put down everything that has built America. Each day I say to myself &#8220;well it can&rsquo;t get any worse&#8221; but then the very next day it is worse. I am very sure I and most others understand what these throwbacks mean when they say My Girlfriend but we just say &#8220;Oh that is awful&#8221; and get in our cars to go to the Walmart to load up on chinese Products. I hate to say it but maybe we are getting what we deserve? Our backbone and common sense seem to have vanished.</p>

		<p>Manchester, NH.  Pop. roughly 100,000?  Any men in this town ready to express outrage at the handling of this pathetic incident?  What happened to the days when a mob of pissed off angry men gathered axe handles and pitch forks and met at the front of the police station?  How many police are there?  Will they try to disperse the mob?  Of course, but the case will be made known, the details will be made known, demands will be made known, and outrage will be made known.  All of this can be made known nationaly if the mob is big enough and pissed off enough.  How else do you expect to get any real sympathy?  I live in WI, I sympathise with this situation, but without Amren, how would I have known about it?  Its way past time we use the tactics of our enemy.  We all know the &#8220;if the races were reversed&#8221; scenario.  In that scenario, if the authorities had done nothing, half of NH would be on fire as I type.  DO NOT riot violently, but you can express outrage through sheer numbers and very loud voices.  Without it, why would our enemies budge?  I swear, by our current actions, they probably think we don&rsquo;t care.  And they KNOW they are winning.</p>

<p>fred:   They are anything but mentally ill or radical and many, if not most, hold the same views you do.  </p>
<p>I know this because I hear it behind closed doors all the time, from custodians and aides (well, the few left) to teachers, all the way up to area and district superintendents.  The lefty persona is a &#8220;working construct&#8221; which allow us to get through the day, collect our shrinking paychecks, go home in peace and know we won&rsquo;t have to face the inquisitors of the PC Reign of Terror who hold sway over our careers and pensions.</p>
<p>But this is changing as a new, non-White, racially/ethnically radicalized cohort replaces mine.  They are poorly educated in subject matter but able to spout the latest Marxist slogans, which seem to drive them.</p>
<p>As for the refugee situation in NH:</p>
<p>The two federal refugee contractors in New Hampshire are the International Institute of New Hampshire and Lutheran Social Services.</p>
<p>The mayor of Manchester NH, stated his concerns last year:</p>
<p><i>Mayor Ted Gatsas is accusing a local refugee resettlement agency of steering newly arrived refugees into &ldquo;substandard&rdquo; apartments and failing to ensure their health and well-being.</i></p>
<p><i>The letter asks the state to pressure the agency to change its ways. It calls for new regulations requiring the International Institute of New Hampshire to meet regularly with city officials and to notify the city before new refugees arrive.</i></p>
<p>The state and Feds weren&rsquo;t about to let the mayor&rsquo;s calls go unheeded:</p>
<p><i>Manchester is one of four cities targeted by the Center for Prevention of Hate Violence to charge that Americans are racist.  It will spend the next three years on The New Migration Project working in cities in strife after immigrants have moved in. One of those communities is Manchester, N.H. That will be followed up with a national conference in Lewiston later this year.</i></p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this, what Manchester (and all of us) are up against:</p>
<p><i>According to the Partners Against Hate website the whole political initiative is coming from the US Justice Department.</i></p>
<p>Are you surprised?</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve repeatedly stated:  <b>Any and all refugee programs along with H-1B visas should be immediately criminalized.</b></p>
<p>Sources:  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cnznqs" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/cnznqs</a></p>
<p>This is not about &#8220;helping&#8221; African or any other refugee:  It is about White genocide, flooding and destroying Whites homelands worldwide with backwards, violent, incompatible &#8220;others&#8221; and then screaming &#8220;racist&#8221; at anyone who objects.</p>
<p>It appears more and more are becoming aware of White genocide because it&rsquo;s becoming impossible to ignore.  We Californians have been on the front lines for decades now and our state is past the point of no return.</p>
<p>If I were Morgan&rsquo;s mother, I would find a disinterested lawyer (and they do exist) to fight this atrocity even if it meant mortgaging my home, cashing in every thing I have and facing possibly a massive loss or at best a Pyrrhic victory. </p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t stop until either justice were served (and it may not be) or I were destroyed.</p>

		<p>To deflect the blame from being placed on the perpetrators, these Africans, there&rsquo;ll be a lot of talk about how procedures should be revised, the correct chain of command, proper paperwork, how things slipped through the cracks, etc. Also, those youth weren&rsquo;t &#8220;provided with proper coping skills&#8221; (love that one), so those that failed to provide it are really to blame. Anything to get off the subject of importing the dregs of Africa and putting them next to your children, a very bad formula. Also, the Dept of Education is on the backs of most principals to not have higher rates of discipline for blacks than for whites so most will try to sweep it under the rug. The incompetent nurse falsely reported it as a &#8220;fight&#8221;, rather than what it really was, an attack. They&rsquo;ll try to pin some blame on the girl by saying she provoked them, she&rsquo;s somehow responsible for getting her teeth knocked out, and so on. </p>

<p>A similar incident happened last July in France. A white teenage girl was walking on the sidewalk in Paris when a group of black males approached her asking for her number. The white girl refused at which point one of the black males slapped her hard across the face. They laughed as she walked away holding her hand against her face. The incident was recorded on video, unfortunately it was taken down from the internet and hasn&rsquo;t been reposted.</p>
<p>I sympathize with white girls/women who are approached  by black males.  They have an entitlement complex, white women are the prize they have been waiting to get their hands on since they were children.</p>

<p>furthermore, her friends just stood there and watched but did nothing.  that is how passive and helpless whites have become, when attacked  by nonwhites. even in their own countries!</p>

		<p>Here is a positive step someone living in the Manchester area might consider:  Give a five minute presentation at the next school board meeting.  Give the details of the incident and then end with a recommendation that the perps be permanently expelled from the Manchester school system and that the principal be fired.  That could lead to more press coverage and possibly more involvement by more citizens.  Further activism should focus on the single objective of getting the principal fired.  Grand philosophical points are of little use in a situation like this.</p>

		<p>One can imagine this kind of behavior from entitled white &#8220;jocks&#8221; when rejected by a desireable girl, but the idea that immigrants come here with this entitled bombast illustrates the lack of respect for white americans among foreigners: whites are not respected since we do not respect ourselves and our own rights anymore.

		<p>Poster #39 has spoken the god honest truth.  You cannot put your children in a school where there is more than 5% blacks or latinos.  </p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there are SO MANY schools now that are 100% non-white?  Even when there happen to be whites still living in or near the area?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because enough white kids were victims that the parents pulled their kids out in a stampede.  The private school business is booming and this is the &#8216;white tax&rsquo; we have to pay to keep our kids safe.  </p>
<p>I work in the schools in a big major urban area.  Neither myself nor any white teacher I know would ever consider - in a million years - to send our kids to the kind of schools we work in.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because of the violence from wild african and latino &#8216;youths&rsquo; who are often OVER AGE by several years; because of the anti-learning culture said &#8216;youths&rsquo; foster, and because the immorality from these &#8216;youths&rsquo; is on the scale of sodom and gomorreh.  That last point is particularly salient.  </p>
<p>All the black and latino boys use every opportunity on the internet at school to look up porn sites, gang sites and really violent gangsta rap videos.  That&rsquo;s all they want to do!  </p>
<p>The girls compete with each other to see who can be the biggest, most fabulous hoochi momma diva.  They ALL cuss and curse NON STOP and casual sex, drug use and other behaviors that lead to failure and poverty in life are EPIDEMIC.  This is why all school reforms fail, year after year.  The population shifted from white students, most of whom had some modicom of civility, to blacks and then latinos who hate whitey, his knowledge and his values.</p>

		<p>&#8220;12-Year-Old Girl Punched in Face During Alleged Bullying Attack&#8221;</p>
<p>What a bunch of stupid newspeak. The attack happened, so what in the world is the phrase &#8220;alleged bullying&#8221; supposed to add?? The headline should read,</p>
<p>&#8220;12-Year-Old Girl&rsquo;s teeth knocked out by 14 year-old African classmate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the mother&rsquo;s blog, this paragraph is an Orwellian concoction also:</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys are refugees brought over from Kenya and Ethiopia. It makes me question if we are providing these children with proper coping skills for a healthy transition. Also, is it safe for these students to be held back to due to language barriers leaving such a great age difference between students. I can&rsquo;t imagine the rage these boys must be harvesting inside to attack a girl so brutally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rage&#8221; my foot&hellip;they&rsquo;re just feral animals doing what feral animals do when prey doesn&rsquo;t surrender meekly. &#8220;Coping skills&#8221;? What fantasy land are we living in? And as for their being in the same class as 12-year olds, yes that is insane, almost as insane as bringing them to New Hampshire in the first place and putting them anywhere in a school with white students.</p>
<p>On the original article there&rsquo;s a video of a TV news report about the attack, and race and the fact that the attackers are immigrants is not even mentioned (I don&rsquo;t watch TV, so that was a bit of an awakening to me).</p>

<p>Approach 1 is the problem, 2 the solution but a large percentage of whites think on the lines of 1. For the solution to manifest in the American or any white society at large, what is required is the mass transition of mindset from #1 to #2, of course without &amp; before losing sanity.</p>
<p>You should speak the language[violence here] your audience [blacks] understands, not what you understand !</p>
<p>I am a South-Asian living in the US and this is my observation. I believe that Americans should protect themselves and that to my mind would mean being 90% or more white. I wish I could say the same about my people.</p>

<p>Back in the late 1980s the &#8220;Lethal Weapon&#8221; series was a big hit with black cop Danny Glover dealing violence against White bad guys. However these days when it&rsquo;s on  &mdash;  especially &#8220;Lethal Weapon 2&#8221;  &mdash;  I tend to root for the White South Africans. </p>

		<p>My first question is, &#8220;why do the idiot parents have this girl in this school to begin with?&#8221;  At some point we have to take responsibility for allowing ourselves to be targets of racial violence and anti-white brainwashing.  White man, you don&rsquo;t have to be violent to take action. We can still win this war with non-violent resistance.  But, we must resist!!!</p>

&#8220;Is there not a single man in that community?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, plenty of eunuchs but no men of the white variety in New Hampshire or anywhere else in the U.S. these days (any white American men that do exist are on foreign soil fighting &#8220;terrorism.&#8221;).  We lost most of our warrior breed with the two world wars and the smaller conflicts since then.  Get used to it.  Things will get worse and more frequent.<br>

		<p>Just went to the original article, and found this comment.  It&rsquo;s so outrageous that I can&rsquo;t be sure it&rsquo;s not a joke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Predictably, there are racists comments posted here. White parents need to understand that it&rsquo;s not unusual for our sons to be held back 2 or 3 years due to inherent institutional racism. White parents should also understand that it is best to advise their daughters to submit or allow sexual play from older boys. Puberty is perfectly natural &amp; a time of experimentation between younger people. I am not sure what the young lady did to provoke the correction by the older Kenyan and Ethiopian boys&#8221;</p>

		<p>The saddest part of this story is that the little girl will probably refuse to go on mission trips to Haiti when she is in high school, and thus deprive the Hatian boys an opportunity to get know Jesus through the White Girl with the Bible and all the other free stuff.  </p>

<p>Not to change the subject or anything, but ever since the &#8220;successful failure&#8221; of the AmRen conference, I do feel the cancellation of it was indeed something that our good friend Jared and Co., and all of us can take an advantage of. Has anyone noticed the higher counts of comments on some of these pages since then? Last year the most I could see was 30 comments on a story similar to this&hellip;now it&rsquo;s up to 80 comments? </p>
<p>Maybe we need to go to Detroit or other black infested cities and find another hotel, get news media, then whites who want to check us out in terms and reason of curiousity, will finally understand and are given proof by the magic link to the original article of stories such as this one for their sought out answer for legitimate proof.<br>
One by one, we&rsquo;ll stir the media up with our requests of conferences and people WILL take notice (Charlotte was a great example). <br>
Imagine the followers we&rsquo;ll get if we tried for a conference  monthly? I&rsquo;ve already got my own friends waking up to me introducing them to this site, but I tell them not to thank me&hellip;thank our friend Jared and everyone on here who contributes their thoughts and truths. </p>

		<p>I hate to say it. I feel great sorrow in saying it. But what happened to this young girl, is happening hundreds, perhaps thousands of times per day, across North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Whites are victimized because they are white. Vick has a wonderful idea. We need to get the message out to our local and national media, every time these incidents occur. You Tube videos can go viral very quickly. But we also must teach our young white males &amp; females that they must work together, as a group, for self-defense. If we don&rsquo;t organize soon, it will be too late. </p>

<p>&#8220;What if there was a national group fronted by a handful of articulate presentable spokespeople, both men and women, who were ready as these incidents arose to go on local TV, or if possible, national TV to talk about the plight of white victims of interracial crimes and demand justice?</p>
<p>Meanwhile activists behind the scenes could be gathering data and releasing press releases targeted at every major media outlet. There could be regional groups with phone trees of activists prepared to send out a dozen or so people with signs to show up at schools, police stations and city halls demanding equal protection for white kids and white victims of interracial crime in general. Signs saying &ldquo;Stop Hate Crimes Against Whites,&rdquo; &ldquo;Equal Justice for White Victims of Racist Violence&rdquo; etc. Heck, if you really want to stir the pot, send a determined group of demonstrators into the black part of town and demand that the black community stop preying on whites. That would get news - and A LOT of sympathetic white people would take notice, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>White Victims of Interracial Crime. The group could have a name like that. Plus there could be a fund that would help white victims get medical care, psychological help. And a legal aid network that could pursue civil lawsuits and get settlements for the victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brilliant. &#8220;White Victims of Interracial Crime&#8221; is a great name for such a group (challengers will demand why the members of such a group aren&rsquo;t concerning themselves also with the issue of &#8220;white victims of white crime,&#8221; but that&rsquo;s the beginning of a discussion that will sharpen our own understandings and hopefully also wake up a lot of people*), and signs saying &ldquo;Stop Hate Crimes Against Whites&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Equal Justice for White Victims of Racist Violence&rdquo; are perfect for the kind of demonstrations you describe. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the spunk to organize it, but I&rsquo;m ripe for recruitment.</p>
<p>*E.g., more white women in the U.S. are sexually assaulted by whites than by blacks, but the percent of black men who assault white women is several times the percent of white men who assault white women. And I assume that large metropolitan areas with large black populations are more or less similar to Berkeley, Ca. where I live&hellip;I never hear of violent crimes being committed by whites here (the I assume it must happen); it&rsquo;s ALWAYS blacks, blacks, blacks, blacks, and recently, Hispanics.</p>
<p>In any case, a group named &#8220;White Victims of Interracial Crime&#8221; would force people to think about the very concept. Twenty five years ago, in spite of myself and others I know having been victims of violent black on white crime, I didn&rsquo;t think about the assaults that way. When a friend tried to convince me that integration had resulted in &#8220;racial conflict&#8221; and &#8220;racial tension,&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about&hellip;I hadn&rsquo;t been aware of any &#8220;racial tension&#8221; in the SFBay area (I was dimmer maybe than even most liberals, but still&hellip;), in spite of all the insults and attitudes and considerably worse I&rsquo;d gotten. I was a liberal, even AFTER getting mugged. </p>
<p>But the existence of a group named &#8220;White Victims of Interracial Crime&#8221; might have gotten me thinking.</p>

Several posters noted that this girl may be nonwhite.  It seems so.  Her skin tones, though light, are different from west European.  She just doesn,t look like  a young anglosaxon  girl.  Think of the recent Shirley Temple commercials, and compare.  This girl  has prominent epicanthal folds.  This is found much more in various nonwhite populations, especially Asian.  However a good example exists in a Black Capoid type on the Racial Realist website.  Also the eyes, which are almost flush with the eyebrows matched this picture.  This contrasts markedly with the much deeper set eyes in Caucasoids.  Lips are too distorted by swelling to tell a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe the mother&rsquo;s strange sympathies with the black boys isn&rsquo;t so strange after all.  </p>

		<p>I saw this on WMUR when it first aired. The video is on the link to the original article. Notice that there is no mention made of the ethnicity of the assailants in the WMUR report. Polite people aren&rsquo;t supposed to notice, even if one is literally hit in the face with it.</p>
<p>Manchester historically has had a large contingent of people derived from French Canadians; the name Gauthier implies such heritage. Manchester has been getting more diverse. The only person on New Hampshire&rsquo;s death row is a black man from Massachusetts who murdered a police officer a few years ago.</p>
<p>42- John Engelman<br>
&#8220;When it comes to blacks, absence makes the heart grow fond. Whites who have the least contact with blacks generally are the whites who have the highest opinion of them. These whites find it easy to forgive blacks for their behavior, unless it happens to them. Then they have an epiphany.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I think you are right. I grew up in northern New England and was taught as a child that blacks are just like us except for their skin color. We couldn&rsquo;t understand our &#8220;prejudiced&#8221; relatives who lived in a big city in central CT and who severely criticized blacks. </p>
<p>I also agree with poster 53 - patriot, who said &#8220;And anyone who dares speak the truth of what the situation really is, will be viewed as somehow more of a danger than the actual violent nonwhites - as if it were our &lsquo;attitudes&rsquo; that were the root cause of the violence.&#8221; Woe to nearly anyone who suggests that diversity is not always a good thing. I think that the only ones who could get away with making a connection publicly between ethnicity/race and violent behavior would be the ones directly involved in an attack, such as the innocent little girl here, or her mother or father, who could claim righteous indignation. People wouldn&rsquo;t blame them for that.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the girl is mixed or not- she is perceived to be white by the authorities. It is hard to tell based on the photo, it is possible that swelling or other discolorations make a racial identification impossible. I wish that a normal photo had been included. The mom should have that picture blown up to poster size and she should protest in front of the police station until something is done.

<p>Some commentators are suggesting a mixed-race girl. I certainly don&rsquo;t see this observation   &mdash;   perhaps mixed-European, but not the former. The mother&rsquo;s first and last names of <i>Danielle Gauthier</i> strongly suggests French-Canadian roots from the province of Quebec that borders with New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Also, the newscaster describes the un-identified perpetrators as &#8220;the boys&#8221; which only leaves the listeners with a false impression these thugs must be All-American white boys, when in fact, they are Black African refugee &#8220;boys&#8221; dumped onto American soil.</p>

<p><i>Most whites are not aware that they are indeed the victims, because the truth is distorted. Most whites do not realize that they have been indoctrinated.</i></p>
<p>I believe this is starting to come to an end based on the comments I read here and on other, even MSM sites.   The lies of the media are being exposed on the Internet and elsewhere, the lies of American schools are being exposed as more and more parents pull their children out of the government indoctrination centers for home studies that better reflect White values; we are increasingly becoming aware that diversity is not a strength but a method to wipe us Whites out and destroy our homelands (so there will be nowhere for us to run).</p>
<p>This is ALL thanks to the Internet (and to a lesser extend, talk radio).  (and it is no wonder that the USG is busy making up ridiculous scenarios to take control of our last vestige of Free Expression and Uncensored News).</p>
<p>If you are in SA you are well aware of government Internet censorship.  Try calling up za*****.com/net/inc etc.  It is down AGAIN.</p>
<p>For a particularly heinous and egregious example of media White hatred and excusing of violent blacks, here is a link to a new article about the Percy Massacre in Arkansas from Nicholas Stix:</p>
<p><i>I had initially written about this racial atrocity for VDARE.com on February 9, 2010, in Never Heard of the Pearcy Massacre? One Guess Why Not!</i>  </p>
<p><b>And this remains the only national coverage.</b></p>
<p><i>On November 12, 2009, a crew robbed the Pearcy, Arkansas, Gentry family of some wire rims and flat screen TVs &mdash; and shot and killed, execution-style, 80-year-old Edward Earl Gentry Sr.; his 56-year-old son, Edward &ldquo;Eddie&rdquo; Gentry Jr.; Eddie&rsquo;s 52-year-old wife, Pam; Eddie and Pam&rsquo;s 24-year-old son, Jeremy; and Jeremy&rsquo;s 19-year-old girlfriend, Kristen Warneke.</i></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/4hvspvs</p>
<p>WHY is the media covering this up?  You have one guess.</p>
<p>And:  Spread the Word; Tell Everyone You Know:  The MSM is to be shunned by Whites and considered a mortal enemy.</p>

What I am saying is that these immigrants are NOT RESPECTING of what America used to represent; a powerful intimidating super-power with assertive and fearsome citizens.  No. America has evolved in it&rsquo;s image abroad as a country of frightened whites who are fearful of asserting themselves and defending their own children.

		<p>This story made my blood boil.  Yet when I related it to some of my neighbors here in New York, there was no reaction.  Though the people I told it to are fairly normal people,  they were strangely unmoved by the story of a little white girl being savagely beaten by African thugs.  They were even unmoved when I added the part about how some people felt it was her fault, because she was so insensitive to the feelings of the downtrodden Africans, who were, after all, just trying to be friendly. That is a measure of how far we have been brainwashed.  Sixty years of absorbing the media conditioning has left most white people in a zombie-like state, and there is, apparently nothing so extreme that it would outrage them. <br>
Right now, those of us who are capable of human feelings are in the minority. White awareness is growing every day, but is it enough? It will take some effort to overcome the effects of the brainwashing.  The Frankfort School Marxists who started it by seizing control of the new technologies of mass communication back in the 1950s understood the power of words.  By now, we must see how easy it is to brainwash people through propaganda. Also, we must see that it is not only primitive tribal people who are susceptible to brainwashing.  Educated people living in Western democracies have proven to be very amenable to being programmed.  That  is proven by the number of professionals who hold &#8220;liberal&#8221; beliefs. I proved it again to myself yesterday when I tried to arouse some well-educated white people to some spark of feeling with my story of the little white girl victimized so brutally. <br>
I suggest that we work on ways to reverse the programming on a large scale, develop ways of deprogramming our people the way they deprogram those kidnapped by religious cults.  That is very vague, I know, but it is only a general statement that can easily be made more specific. I do agree that grass roots action by people in the local community of Manchester is also necessary.  But by itself it is not enough.<br>
One more thing.  I look at the picture and IMHO I think she looks quite properly white.  There is a lot of variation in appearance among white people, as I can attest when I visit my home village in a remote part of Bavaria, which I have been doing since the 1950s. My relatives do not look very Nordic, they are in fact classified as being Alpine, rather than Nordic, yet they are pure White and proud of it. </p>

		<p>When it comes to having white children in America these days, you have to do one of two things(assuming there is no 100% white public school nearby, which is unfortunately rather unlikely these days).  Preferably both.</p>
<p>1) Teach them to defend themselves, especially against non-whites.</p>
<p>2) Home school them.</p>

<p>I wish it were that simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never known black to attack white unless the white were defenseless and outnumbered. </p>
<p>When blacks are outnumbered by Whites they will be your best buddies &hellip; or stay away from you. I&rsquo;ve never seen a lone white kid attacked by one black. I&rsquo;ve often seen lone white kids attacked by groups of blacks. It&rsquo;s their tribal genetic predisposition. </p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re black, they&rsquo;re in a pack.</p>

		<p>A couple of weeks ago I was talking with family about how my neighborhood has changed racially.  Probably over 50% Asian and increasing every day.  My sister thankfully lives in an almost all-white area, although too close to black/hispanic areas.  My brother-in-law said he would rather live in a mixed neighborhood&hellip;1/3 white, 1/3 black, 1/3 hispanic.  I said he was crazy to want my niece and nephew go to a school like that.  See how far the brain-washing has gone?</p>

		<p>Since these attackers are immigrants in this country, it would be worthwhile to have the victim complain to the immigration service.  There is a law that requires the deportation of any immigrant that breaks the laws even a legal immigrant.</p>

<p>Some thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>The victim argument does work and it is used by most groups when they want to push an agenda. However easy it may seem, it can often be counter productive. It yields very slow change. It only works through constant repetition and accusations of how &#8220;bad,&#8221; &#8220;evil,&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; the opposite side is. You then can demand grievances and social measures which raise one&rsquo;s morals (by neglecting personal responsibility) by vilifying the opposition to instill guilt. </p>
<p>From a tactical standpoint, it is a very effective style of augmentation, because it immediately puts you on the defensive in having to explain yourself. You have to put on a lower level by making yourself a victim in some way. Most are aware subconsciously that you&rsquo;re are going to do either those things  &mdash;  in which they have a whole slew of arguments to pound you and eventually demand some reprimand and then you lost the argument.</p>
<p>The best way to argue against victimization style arguments is not to play the victim card yourself or try prove yourself not be the evil bad guy.</p>
<p>For example: When someone calls you, a &#8220;racist.&#8221;<br>
What usually ends up happening is you say &#8220;I&rsquo;m not racist but&hellip;&#8221; or &#8220;Racism can happen to whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately that gives ammunition. Also making yourself a the victim will drive the conversation into &#8220;who is more of a victim = who should morally superior = who should be entitled to get  &mdash;  self redundant.&#8221; If you say this other side can deny it, etc. From where this issue stands on the political spectrum (as well as the dangers) there isn&rsquo;t enough time to go &#8216;round about.</p>
<p>A way to get a cognitive shift in a political thought processes or other processes is to go straight against the grain. It is much faster than slowly doing it as with victimization. </p>
<p>So someone calls you a racist.</p>
<p>You say, &#8220;Yeah sure, I&rsquo;m a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>[That immediately will startle and stun most as most will expect you to deny such charges.]</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah well your evil. Racist are evil. Racism leads to slavery and death and Hitler. Skin color is superficial. (fill in argument).&#8221;</p>
<p>[Notice now you are not having to defend yourself personally. You are not allowing to the opponent to define the argument. This allows for you to go on the offensive.]</p>
<p>&#8220;It is part of human nature. Slavery happened 200 yrs ago get over it. No skin color isn&rsquo;t superficial.(what ever the counter argument is).&#8221;</p>
<p>[You are debating about what you wanted to debate about rather than trying to defend yourself. It no longer becomes a witch hunt trying to hunt out racist, with those accused trying to explain themselves. Failure to do this causes the opponents to become more ignited with more furor and fanaticism as you through actions make them believe their arguments even more]</p>
<p>I like Jared is because he doesn&rsquo;t really use much, if any, victim argumentation (with few exceptions whether under extreme pressure or to make a actual point about something factual). He usually cuts through it. When someone calls him racist. He just starts sticking up his points rather than becoming on the defensive by saying he is not a racist&hellip;and trying to explain himself. This is why he is such a threat. He doesn&rsquo;t play the game.</p>
<p>Something to think about in terms of Style of Argumentation and Psychology. Sorry for any grammar or crazy talking. I tired and about to go to bed.</p>

		<p>I just remembered a program about &#8220;white supremacist groups&#8221; on the History Channel about 8-10 years ago. A young white woman was presented as the model of what a racist thinks like because she said she would never date a black man.  She said she wanted to have white children, and only marry a white man.  This, according to the History Channel, was the ultimate evil. Later in the same show, they spoke to a white woman who, unlike the misguided &#8220;racist&#8221; had experienced the joys of diversity and now realized that it was wrong for white women to want to have white children. This is the mentality of the leftist, who celebrates the extinction of the white race through interbreeding.  To the leftist, the greatest evil in the world is a white woman having white children and refusing the opportunity to interbreed with blacks. That is one of the unspoken reasons they hate Sarah Palin and her family.  If only Sarah and her daughter had interbred with blacks, these &#8220;liberals&#8221; would be gushing with delight. <br>
That such sick ideas are gathering momentum is apparent when we see what is being promoted on TV.  Tyra Banks, in a brief ad for her talk show, is shown asking a well-known white actress, &#8220;Would you go out with a black man?&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think she meant dinner and a show. That the question was asked in a shy and non-confrontational manner by Banks only conceals the true genocidal intent of such challenges. That such questions are frequently asked today, not just on TV but on the street and in the workplace and classroom, demonstrates the seriousness of the threat.  Any white woman who answers &#8220;No&#8221; to that question is designated as a racist and marked for violent retribution or even death. Of course we must allow that most white women, unlike that little girl, still retain the freedom of choice to decide which particular black man to submit to.  Yes, our black masters are certainly lenient and open-minded, aren&rsquo;t they? <br>
The goal is of course the end of the white race.  Given the ever-growing pressure of white women to submit to the imperatives of diversity, we could see the end of the white race within one generation. </p>

#105 &#8221; Some commentators are suggesting a mixed-race girl. I certainly don&rsquo;t see this observation  &mdash;  perhaps mixed-European, but not the former. The mother&rsquo;s first and last names of Danielle Gauthier strongly suggests French-Canadian roots from the province of Quebec that borders with New Hampshire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, the newscaster describes the un-identified perpetrators as &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; which only leaves the listeners with a false impression these thugs must be All-American white boys, when in fact, they are Black African refugee &ldquo;boys&rdquo; dumped onto American soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full picture of her on the video leads one away from my previous suspicion #98.  Given that, it is doubly disturbing that the mother could be so brain washed that she could see these boy&rsquo;s side of things.  It will be a daunting task to re-educate masses of our brightest young people who have been so powerfully propagandized in their formative years.</p>
<p>Obviously the blackness of the perpetrators has been hidden from the viewer.  If anyone reading this, works at a tv station or a newspaper where the decisions are made so uniformly to obscure black crime, would you mind giving us an idea of the actual mechanics of how these remarkable biases are carried out.  What persons in what positions actually enforce such misleading news.  It is actually dangerous because many people won&rsquo;t take the proper precautions because they are purposely kept ignorant.  You may have to shut up at work, but here you can be anonymous.  You could literally be saving lives.</p>

		<p>I too was intrigued by the story that Abe Lincoln had as a young man been attacked by a group of blacks. Here&rsquo;s what I found:</p>
<p>Lincoln wrote several short autobiographical sketches during his lifetime. One was written (in the third person) in June of 1860 at the request of the  Chicago Press and Tribune. The relevant bit:</p>
<p>&#8220;When he was nineteen, still residing in Indiana, he made his first trip upon a flatboat to New Orleans. He was a hired hand merely, and he and a son of the owner, without other assistance, made the trip. The nature of part of the &#8216;cargo-load,&rsquo; as it was called, made it necessary for them to linger and trade along the sugar-coast; and one night they were attacked by seven negroes with intent to kill and rob them. They were hurt some in the mêlée, but succeeded in driving the negroes from the boat, and then &#8216;cut cable,&rsquo; &#8216;weighed anchor,&rsquo; and left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Read the whole thing, along with two other short autobiographical pieces, here: <a href="https://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/autobiog.htm" rel="nofollow">https://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/autobiog.htm</a></p>

		<p>I went to school with a lot of blacks(that was a very long time ago). They werent any worse than the white kids at that time.Things have changed radically since then.If I were going to school at this time,my parents would have constantly warned me about the dangers of blacks,and I would be able to avoid being victinized by them.</p>
