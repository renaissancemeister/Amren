<h1>Southern Poverty Law Center Maligns SIOA as &#8220;Hate Group&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pamela Geller, Atlas Shrugs, February 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One day after another Islamic supremacist plot was thwarted in Texas (with the intention of &#8220;killing infidel Americans&#8221; with &#8220;weapons of mass destruction&#8221;), the subversive uber-leftwing fringe group, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), has slandered our human rights organization, SIOA [Stop Islamization of America], as a &#8220;hate group.&#8221; The haters and deceivers accuse us of what they themselves are guilty of.</p>
<p>Before the collapse of the Soviet Union the SPLC was designated as a Communist front. It was essentially run by a couple, Anne and Carl Braden, who were CPUSA members. They had been identified in sworn testimony, and they made no attempt to deny the allegations. They would be proud that their legacy remains intact - their &#8220;heirs&#8221;  &mdash;  destroyers and America-haters  &mdash;  continue the work to subvert, destroy America.</p>
<p>[Why] doesn&rsquo;t the SPLC even have a category for Islamic jihadi groups? Not one. The greatest threat facing our nation, our people, our world, and they are shilling for them and smearing those of us fighting for preservation of our freedom.</p>
<p>Here is proof: recently a reader sent me an exchange he had with the SPLC&rsquo;s Mark Potok. Reader Bob wrote, &#8220;I started out by looking on their website for a definition of the term &#8216;hate group&rsquo; fully expecting that Islam would fit any reasonable definition. When I couldn&rsquo;t find such a definition (still can&rsquo;t today) I inquired.&#8221; In the course of the exchange, Potok wrote back: &#8220;With regard to monitoring radical jihadists, we have made a pragmatic decision to leave that mainly to the major Jewish NGOs, which do a good job and have some real expertise that would likely take us years to develop.&#8221; In other words, the real hate just doesn&rsquo;t matter to the SPLC. &#8220;Still,&#8221; Potok continued, &#8220;we do cover black Muslim extremists and have written about such matters as the connections between radical Muslims and neo-Nazis.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But consider what they have admitted to here. They refuse to cover, evaluate, or report on the single greatest threat to free men here and across the world. The jihad is exempt from the prying, dishonest leadership of the SLPC, but those who are standing up against these tremendous odds are being smeared, defamed and destroyed.</p>
<p>The SPLC is getting well paid to do this. According to the SPLC&rsquo;s 990 Form for 2008, the SPLC&rsquo;s Chief Trial Counsel Morris Dees made a generous $348,420 that year. SPLC President and CEO, Richard Cohen, was right behind him, at $344,490. General Counsel Joseph Levin made $189,166. Legal director Rhonda Brownstein brought in $179,806; CFO Teenie Hutchinson, $155,414. Potok pulled in $143,099. Former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Blancett made $159,301  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s right, the former COO.</p>

		<p> Stop Islamization of America should join with the multitude of other organizations and individuals who have been maligned by the SPLC, and file a huge, class-action lawsuit against these vile-tongued troublemakers. Pointing the finger at them and protesting how unfair they&rsquo;re being may make us feel better, but it won&rsquo;t stop them. You&rsquo;ve got to get into those deep pockets of theirs to do that.</p>
<p> Wonder how the high muckety-mucks of the SPLC whose salaries were listed in Geller&rsquo;s story would like to be forced to cough up a big part of that inflated compensation in damages, court costs and legal fees? That would do more to cool their rhetoric than anything else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how this big economic downturn has affected their donations.  The adverse publicity they&rsquo;ve been getting of late from Congress and other groups that have been reporting nationally has got be affecting them as well.</p>
<p>If this economy falls into a full depression as some are forecasting, then we just might see major layoffs.</p>
<p>One way or another the group must be disbanded or neutralized.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d best stick to the facts here. I am unaware of any formal connection between the Bradens and the SPLC.  The Bradens were associated with a lot of other left wing organizations in the south, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they never ran the SPLC.</p>
<p>It is true that jihadist Muslim groups are never going to be counted as &#8220;haters&#8221; by the SPLC, any more than will radical Mestizo organizations like the Brown Berets.  The SPLC really only cares about labeling white people as haters.  Yes, they include the NOI as a hate group, but that&rsquo;s primarily window dressing, similar to when the ACLU, long ago, defended the K when they wanted to hold a march through a Jewish neighborhood.  The ACLU knew that if they took on that single case they would forever be able to point back at it to &#8220;prove&#8221; that they don&rsquo;t have a left wing bias.  Of course the ACLU is very left wing, and in fact has refused to take on a much less controversial free speech case that didn&rsquo;t fit in with their pro-illegal immigration agenda.</p>

<p>Translation:  We&rsquo;ve already crashed the ADL&rsquo;s party, and should we crash it any more, it&rsquo;ll be open warfare between us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that the ADL has the occasional laudatory quote about SIOA, which means that this by itself, combined with the Armenian genocide controversy, might hasten the open warfare between the ADL and SPLC.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Potok continued, &ldquo;we do cover black Muslim extremists and have written about such matters as the connections between radical Muslims and neo-Nazis.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Of which there are almost none.  Zero, for all practical intents and purposes.  The ONLY reason the SPLC mentions &#8220;black Muslim extremists&#8221; all is because, unlike black non-Muslim extremists, they explicitly target and hate Jews.  Of course, the SPLC doesn&rsquo;t grok WHY they target Jews, that it&rsquo;s not samey-same as a given right wing white person targeting Jews.  That, or they don&rsquo;t care, because of the money hustle angle.</p>

		<p>Ms. Geller appears to be either confused, misinformed or simply dishonest. I see no evidence, after an on-line search, that the Bradens were ever involved with the SPLC, nor that the SPLC was ever listed by any official organization, governmental or otherwise, as a Communist front group. (The SPLC was not even founded until 1971  &mdash;   long after such listings became passe  &mdash;   and co-founder Morris Dees has essentially run the show for all of these forty years, although his official role is as Chief Trial Counsel, as listed above, rather than as Executive Director or the like.) If does not do either Ms. Geller&rsquo;s or AmRen&rsquo;s cause any appreciable good to be making serious (if rather belated and outdated) charges of Communist Party, U.S.A. membership that are so easily shown to be misplaced, vis-a-vis the SPLC, through people who were apparently not involved with it.</p>

		<p>You can get the full, hate-mongering agenda of the SPLC at the Southern Legal Resource Center.  If this was 150 years ago, Mo Dees and the SPLC would have been run out of Alabama.  My Confederate ancestors would roll over in their graves to know that a firm such as the SPLC was operating down here in Dixie!<br>

		<p>It may have once been a Communist front, but today the SPLC is nothing more than a lucrative scam:<br>
<a href="http://rkeefe57.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/splc-the-biggest-lie-keeps-getting-bigger/" rel="nofollow">http://rkeefe57.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/splc-the-biggest-lie-keeps-getting-bigger/</a><br>
(&hellip;)<br>
&#8220;First of all, there is NO legal definition for &ldquo;hate group,&rdquo; which is why even the FBI does not, can not, &ldquo;track hate groups.&rdquo; Even the SPLC&rsquo;s $147,000 donor-dollar-a-year public relations guru Mark Potok has admitted this simple fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FBI does not monitor groups just because they have &ldquo;hateful&rdquo; ideology. There must be some evidence of criminal wrongdoing.&ldquo; (www.usatoday.com, May 17, 2002)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, a &ldquo;hate group&rdquo; is pretty much anything Mark Potok says it is. In the past, Potok has said on several occasions that: &ldquo;&hellip;a &ldquo;hate group&rdquo; has nothing to do with criminality&hellip; [or] potential for violence&hellip;&rdquo; Rather, as Potok put it, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about ideology.&rdquo;<br>
(&hellip;)<br>
&#8220;At least we know that the entire resources of the vaunted Southern Poverty Law Center went into creating this extensive document, right? After all, the SPLC has generated more than a third of a BILLION tax-free dollars since 2003, and that ain&rsquo;t chump change. The donors and the IRS can rest assured that all that money is going toward &ldquo;fighting hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This list was compiled using hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports,&rdquo; reads the Map legend.</p>
<p><b>Interestingly, despite having more than $350 MILLION tax-free dollars at his disposal, &ldquo;Mark Potok, who has directed the SLPC&rsquo;s Intelligence Project for 12 years, said the report relies on media, citizen and law enforcement reports, and does not include original reporting by SPLC staff.&rdquo; (www.postcrescent.com, July 6, 2009)</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm, no original reporting, more of a &ldquo;news clipping service&rdquo; kind of thing. Well, no matter, as we&rsquo;ve seen, at least the data is carefully vetted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Potok acknowledged that some of the groups may be small and said it is impossible for outsiders to gauge the membership of most of the groups.&rdquo; (David Crary, Associated Press Online, March 10, 2008)</p>
<p>Hard to gauge, got it. But at least we&rsquo;re talking about real groups of people here, right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Potok says inclusion on the list might come from a minor presence, such as a post office box.&rdquo; (www.sanluisobispo.com, March 25, 2009)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Websites appearing to be merely the work of a single individual, rather than the publication of a group, are not included in this list&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, okay, so a group doesn&rsquo;t have to be an actual group to get a star on the Walk of Shame, and it&rsquo;s important to draw a distinction between individual-owned web sites, which can reach millions of people with one click of the mouse, versus individual-owned P.O. boxes in booming metropolises like Yadkinville, NC, and Splendora, TX. You gotta have standards, after all.&#8221;<br>
(&hellip;)</p>
<p>So what we have is a news-clipping service that denounces those who hold opinions that the news-clipping service doesn&rsquo;t like. </p>

		<p>It is useful to make all the concessions to an adversary you can<br>
in order to focus upon the genuine points of contention that,<br>
properly understood, redound to your own advantage.  Hate and<br>
Love are basic to human nature but Orwellian  misuse of language has evolved to create contrived confusion.  Hate is now<br>
a threshold word that only means the disproportionate and &#8220;misallocated&#8221; focus of the anger that has been a necessary component our evolution  &mdash;  e.g., an anger that which would injure our children; toward  that which would injure or destroy our kinship network, our community, etc.   An AR emphasis upon civility goes a long way to defuse any slander against us as being &#8220;haters&#8221; in the threshold / smear sense of the term.  Those who love everyone are incapable of loving anyone.</p>

		<p>On the Jonathan Pollard issue   &mdash;   Be careful, it&rsquo;s a hot potato.  The politics are far from cut and dry.  Liberal Jews are divided on whether he should be pardoned or not, conservative Jews are divided, liberal white non-Jews are divided, conservative white non-Jews are divided.  The ADL has no official position.  I don&rsquo;t think the SPLC has even mentioned him.</p>

		<p>I agree with Wayne ( the first poster ). For years the SPLC has been guilty of slandering and trashing any group that has an opinion that differs from theirs and has got away with it. It&rsquo;s time for all these groups to get together for a massive law suit for slander and defamation.   Just totally bankrupt them into oblivion. Sooner or later it will happen. Evil cannot last forever and nature must balance itself out in the end.  </p>

		<p>I have a basic problem with the idea of being &#8220;hateful.&#8221;  That is a personality trait that everyone displays at one time or another.  Politicizing hatred as some sort of violation of law is a social set up for an Orwellian style policing of thoughts, let alone words.  Any real American, or philosophical thinker would be against this sort of interpretation and use of a normal human emotion.  I claim the right to hate anything I choose.</p>
