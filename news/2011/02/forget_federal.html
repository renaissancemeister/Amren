<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=257501">Forget Federal Government, We&rsquo;ll Build Fence Ourselves!</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Drew Zahn, WorldNetDaily, January 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Mississippi legislator has caught on to an idea that if the federal government won&rsquo;t complete a border fence separating the United States from Mexico, the states will  &mdash;  and he&rsquo;s planning on taxing illegal immigrants to fund it. </p>
<p>Republican State Sen. Joey Fillingane has filed S.B. 2255, which would charge a fee on all money transfers wired out of the United States, then count the amount as a credit on Mississippi citizens&rsquo; tax returns. The result: Only illegal immigrants sending money abroad would ultimately pay the fees, since they cannot file tax returns to receive a refund. </p>
<p>The net revenue from the non-refunded fees, S.B. 2255 specifies, would then be sent to states like Arizona and Texas for construction of a border fence. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fillingane admits the idea wasn&rsquo;t even his originally, but was presented to him through a tea-party group called the Mississippi Patriots. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bill Chandler, executive director of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, has criticized the bill as harassment of Latinos, who often wire money to relatives back home. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Fillingane rejects the notion that his bill is a racist attack on Latinos. </p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t target Indians, it doesn&rsquo;t target Hispanics even; it targets people who are here in the country illegally, be they from Hispanic-speaking countries or English-speaking countries or Chinese-speaking countries, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&#8221; Fillingane said. &#8220;The bill is designed to go after people breaking the law by being in the country without the proper documentation.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mississippi Patriots tell WND they expect the State Senate&rsquo;s Judiciary Committee to vote on the bill early this week. </p>

		<p>great idea! Also, instead of giving illegals a free ride home when their caught, have them earn their ride home by doing community service. painting graffity, cleaning the trash in the desert, and kissing every ranchers ass along the way whose land was trashed by these horrible disrespectful lawbreakers.</p>

		<p>Now there&rsquo;s an excellent idea.  If that bill passes you can be sure the ACLU and the Obama administration will sue.  Also, I&rsquo;ve noticed that <i>every</i> organization or program with the phrase &#8220;immigrants&rsquo; rights&#8221; is concerned with the alleged rights of illegal aliens to break our immigration laws.<br>

		<p>This would be a good idea even if illegals weren&rsquo;t an issue. I don&rsquo;t like the idea of anyone sending money out of our country. The deficit is big enough already without sending a few more billion dollars out for nothing.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still curious to know why the border states haven&rsquo;t begun fencing the border already.  Why do they have to wait for federal money if the wave of border jumpers are already costing them so much?<br>

		<p>I saw a portion of the existing fence on a TV series about the border wars.  It is an absolute joke.  </p>
<p>The only solution is to build a REAL fence, electrified appropriately, as well as employ K-9 patrols.  Looks like it is up to US citizens to take the initiative and do it right.  It is obvious that our government has no real intention of keeping these illegals out, especially since it welcomes them with open arms (and benefits) when they make it through.</p>

<p>Yeah, good luck with that!</p>
<p>&#8220;Our&#8221; Homeland Security Janet Neopolitan recently stated stupidly, with a straight face, in Texas, of all places, the following:  </p>
<p><i>The southern U.S. border has never been more secure than in recent years. It is inaccurate to state, as too many have, that the border is overrun with violence and out of control! .  This statement   &mdash;   often made only to score political points   &mdash;   is just plain wrong.</i></p>
<p><i>Not only does it ignore all of the statistical evidence, it also belittles the significant progress that effective law enforcement has made to protect this border and the people who live alongside it.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, she can ask the loved ones of Robert Krentz about security along the border and how well the USG is protecting the American people against violent mexican and OTM drug/human smugglers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to hear her explain as to why the USG was compelled to put up signs 70 miles inside Arizona, on sovereign US territory, warning American citizens away from the area due to violent, mexican and OTM drug/human smugglers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of the BLM sign:  https://tinyurl.com/232fnmh</p>
<p>I hope it angers you like nothing else.</p>
<p>Neopolitan blathered on:</p>
<p><i>Today I say to the cartels: Don&rsquo;t even think about bringing your violence and tactics across this border. You will be met by an overwhelming response.<i></i></i></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/4r4arck</p>
<p>Oh, yeah,  That&rsquo;ll sure stop them!  As the well-armed, military-trained smugglers, some with ballistic vests, laugh at the stupidity of American government officials (with good reason).</p>
<p>Good luck State Sen. Joey Fillingane!   Hope you know the forces you&rsquo;re up against:  Those in the USG who have no intention of securing the Southern border or protecting American lives, especially White lives which to them are expendable.</p>

		<p>Bring back the chain gang. For the first offense, put illegals to work building the fence for 6 months, then deport them. The second time they are caught in the country illegally, give them a year of fence building time. Building the fence could be another one of those jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do. Women could be put to work cooking, cleaning and taking care of the prison camps. No point in breaking up families.</p>
<p>The only problem I can see is, some illegals might prefer working on the fence to life in Mexico.</p>
