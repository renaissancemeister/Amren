			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathan Capehart, Washington Post, February 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Post-Kaiser Family Foundation-Harvard University poll on race and recession that ran in Sunday&rsquo;s paper ought to put to rest the unreasonable and politically naive demand by some African Americans that President Obama have an articulated &#8220;Black agenda.&#8221; As if {snip} a few of the measures and steps taken by the president to help all Americans [will not] also disproportionately help people of color. {snip}<br>
Question 40 in the poll asks: &#8220;When it comes to looking out for the economic interests of (INSERT), do you think that the Obama administration is doing too much, too little or about the right amount?&#8221; When the insert is filled by &#8220;you and your family,&#8221; 67 percent of blacks responded &#8220;about the right amount.&#8221; Fill the insert with &#8220;African Americans&#8221; and 63 percent of blacks respond &#8220;about the right amount.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is exactly the way it should be. {snip} Obama has governed the way a president should govern: without fear or favor of one race over another. That blacks feel he is doing right by them is simply icing on the cake. <br>

		<p>The challenge for the Democrat Party is to raise the standard of living of the lower half of the income distribution without requiring white blue collar workers to make sacrifices on behalf of blacks. The Democrat Party met that challenge during the 1930s and 1940s. It failed to meet it during the 1960s and 1970s. <br>
 <br>
In order to achieve this the Democrats need to combine their egalitarian economic policies with the color blind approach of the GOP. </p>

<p>CNN is already promoting their Rodney King reprise &#8220;Race and Rage: the beating of Rodney King&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rage. Get it?  Days of Rage all across the Mideast right now.  Look for &#8220;Rage&#8221; to become a part of the racial discourse and news cycle for the 2012 election.</p>
<p>If black obama doesn&rsquo;t get his &#8220;well earned and much deserved&#8221; second term, everybody will be ready to accept &#8220;rage&#8221; as the &#8220;enriching, authentic, vibrant&#8221; response from the Diversity Curse.<br>

		<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ll come get you.&#8221;  God, I&rsquo;m sick and tired of hearing the whining, hatred, and entitlement from most blacks.  Enough!  Stop demanding.  Stop agitating us.  Stop calling us racists.  Stop forcing yourselves upon us all the time.  Blacks are never happy and never satisfied.  Until they learn to work hard, be responsible, forgive whites, stop making accusations of racism, stop thinking people owe them something, most people (even if they are not white) will be &#8216;racist&rsquo; and &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; against them.  </p>

		<p>Wrong!  You caught blacks with their pants down.  If they put down &#8220;not enough&#8221; it would imply Obama was doing a bad job, and blacks will never admit that no matter what he does.  And if the check &#8220;too much&#8221; it might derail the gravy train.</p>
<p>Blacks HAD to put &#8220;just enough&#8221; since it implies Obama &#8220;done did good&#8221; and leaves the future open to &#8220;we did has enough, but is diff&rsquo;rent now and we needs mo&rsquo; thangs&#8221;.</p>

		<p>When speaking to one another, blacks probably carp plenty about Obama.  After all, they haven&rsquo;t gotten their free houses and cars, let alone their reparations checks.  But when speaking to people who might be white or merely representative of &#8220;the man&#8221;, most blacks will defend another black to the hilt.  It&rsquo;s amazing that even a third did not.</p>

<p>It makes a person wonder if this so called journalist has been living in a cave or he&rsquo;s just too dim-witted to see the obvious.</p>
<p>Obama has a pro-black agenda.  For twentyyears in an anti-white black racist church, plus working as a community organizer who was dedicated all that time to black issues and ONLY black issues, it&rsquo;s more than apparent to anyone savvy enough to correctly analyze this community organizer&rsquo;s intents and motives, that he wanted to be president strictly to advance blacks in one way or another, because they just don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or ability to advance themselves.</p>
<p>If every black would be awarded $50,000 for reparations, given degrees and diplomas, they would eventually fall back to their norm.  Water seeks its own level and so too would incapable blacks who comprise the vast, vast majority of the population.</p>
<p>Blacks are living a lie. They&rsquo;re so arrogant and unintelligent they&rsquo;re blind to their own stupidity and deplorable lack of abilities.</p>

<p>My head is spinning from almost cosmic hypocrisy and irony of this statement. At least other groups that hate us seem to be aware that their self-righteousness is a screen to get to what they want. It looks like blacks really believe that this is the natural order of things. It must be comforting to live in such a fantasy. all I can say to them is good luck with your new amigos. I&rsquo;m not sure that they are going to see quite your way, though.</p>

		<p>To White is Right:  Blacks should forgive whites?  I don&rsquo;t need or want blacks&rsquo; forgiveness as I have not made any transgressions against them.</p>
<p>They may feel free, however, to apologise to me for the spike in crime after the Katrina deserters flooded my South Texas city.  </p>
<p>They may feel free to apologise for the dimwitted bused-in black child that used to steal my school supplies in the fourth grade (without reprimand or punishment as a protected class.)  </p>
<p>They may feel free to apologise for the extra taxes my parents had to pay to school the bused-in blacks into my semi-decent public grammar school after they burned down their own.</p>
<p>They may feel free to apologise for the drunk black who attempted to abduct me in an open downtown area at 8:00 p.m. when I was only twenty-three.  They can additionally apologise for the biological substances that transferred onto my body in my struggle to get free. </p>
<p>They may feel free to apologise to my father, the Colonel, whose military career was given a ceiling due to false accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; (to cover her own ineptitude) by a black, female enlistee early in his career as a Captain.</p>
<p>As for myself, I refuse their forgiveness and offer none of my own.  I do not wish them harm, I simply wish them far, far away.</p>
<p>I will not bare the blame of some supposed injustice carried out by people 6 generations ago (to whom I am not even related) simply because they are envious of my fair and attractive looks and intelligence above the base level.</p>

<p>Absolutely, this almost pathetic need by certain whites to be &#8216;forgiven&rsquo; is  destructive and as you rightly point out the lifetime transgressions of black crime, black &#8216;racism&rsquo; and black pathologies never gets a mention or any real MSM disscussion even though in current day it outnumbers any white on black by a very large margin.</p>

		<p>Whenever I ask people who I know favor Obama white or black What Has He Done they always answer the same way.</p>
<p>Well What About Bush?<br>
In some ways I don&rsquo;t disagree with what they are asking BUT my question to them was WHAT HAS OBAMA DONE.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a question is an Answer to a Question?</p>

<p>Colorblind? More like colorphilic. The GOP shamelessly panders to nonwhites (and in shamefully ridiculous ways, like making Michael Steele their chairman). In any case, if Democrats did follow a &#8220;colorblind&#8221; policy, it would last exactly until they no longer needed the support of whites. Besides, what could a &#8220;colorblind&#8221; policy offer to their core constituencies (read: blacks and mestizos) that a &#8220;color-conscious&#8221; policy can&rsquo;t? Class-based (rather than race-based) affirmative action is clearly out of the question since (going by SAT scores) it would allow the children of low-income whites to get admitted ahead of the children of high-income blacks, and that is simply unacceptable to them.</p>

		<p>I grew in the inner city. I can tell that Barack Obama has done nothing to help the black underclass or any severely disadvantaged people in America.</p>
<p>All of his initiatives have helped only the people he thinks he needs most to get reelected and advance his political party   &mdash;   middle-aged white skilled workers and the white upper middle class.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the black experience is not always different from the experience of everyone else. Look at some of the other people who were brought into the industrial workforce during the World War, then deemed not adequate once the war was over, Applachians specifically. Or the people who lost their industrial jobs in the 1970s never to work again.</p>
<p>The old canard about &#8220;last hired, first fired&#8221;, might have a bigger sweep than we think. </p>
<p>Bringing blacks into the middle class has been a pretty successful enterprise over many decades, though the way it was done at the expense of great damage to some segments of the white population is not commendable.</p>
<p>What the black underclass needs, along with many other people, is to be brought into the working class and the lower middle class. Only that can end dependency as we know it and reduce the magnitude of social welfare costs in state and federal budgets.</p>
<p>Barack Obama, after his much-vaunted career as a community organizer and after living his adult life on the South Side of Chicago, has done precious little, more likely nothing, to address this issue.</p>
<p>As a sidelight, I would like to see how all of the union teachers and other public employees would react if we suggested taking, say, 15 percent of their pay and benefit package and using that to create jobs for the underclass.</p>

<p>Sorry to disagree, but what was done in the 30&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s (and up through today) did require the blue collar white worker to make sacrafices, like seeing milk go from .05 per gallon to 5.00 a gallon, the sacrafice was made through the printing presses of the Fed and the hidden tax of inflation instead of more obvious (or overt) methods. </p>
<p>It just snowballed from there into the gargantuan problem we now face today. </p>
