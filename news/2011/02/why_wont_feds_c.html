<h1>Why Won&rsquo;t Feds Come Clean About Chandra Levy&rsquo;s Killer?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Hollingsworth, Examiner (Washington), February 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ingmar Guandique, the 29-year-old illegal immigrant from El Salvador sentenced to 60 years in prison earlier this month for the murder of former congressional intern Chandra Levy, had a history of violent attacks on women pre-dating his unlawful entry into the United States via the Texas border  &mdash;  as thousands like him continue to do every year. {snip}</p>
<p>According to U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen&rsquo;s sentencing memorandum filed with the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on Feb. 8, &#8220;the government learned, and then confirmed, that [Guandique] fled El Salvador because he was suspected of attacking a woman at knife point on an isolated trail in the village of Cooperativa San Jacinto&#8221; on June 13, 1999  &mdash;  two years before Levy&rsquo;s murder. Federal agents eventually tracked down the victim, identified only as &#8220;Gloria,&#8221; {snip}.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The extent of &#8220;Gloria&rsquo;s&#8221; injuries were so severe that she had to be hospitalized for a month, &#8220;and to this day needs the assistance of a cane in order to walk.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>She also told investigators that Guandique, whom she knew as a child, was also suspected of raping and murdering another local woman near a creek  &mdash;  a creepy precursor of Levy&rsquo;s murder in Rock Creek Park on May 1, 2001, and Guandique&rsquo;s attacks on three other female joggers.</p>
<p>The seventh-grade dropout and MS-13 gang member, whom the U.S. attorney rightly considers a &#8220;grave danger to the community,&#8221; was sent to the U.S. by his family because &#8220;they were concerned that the victim&rsquo;s family was seeking to retaliate.&#8221;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t find out what happened then because the last 43 pages of Machen&rsquo;s 61-page sentencing memo are redacted. On the same day it was filed, Machen also filed a motion to seal Guandique&rsquo;s file. Why? What exactly does the U.S. attorney not want the public to know about Chandra Levy&rsquo;s killer?</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement also refuses to release a copy of the 35-page report prepared at the direction of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano after another illegal immigrant, Carlos Martinelly-Montano, killed a nun and critically injured two others while allegedly driving drunk in Prince William County last August.</p>
<p>{snip} On Feb. 11, the watchdog group [Judicial Watch] received a letter from ICE informing them that the draft report &#8220;will be withheld in its entirety&#8221; in accordance with the law&rsquo;s &#8220;deliberative process privilege&#8221; that shields the bureaucrats who failed to deport Martinelly-Montano when he was turned over to ICE after two prior DUI convictions.</p>
<p>Why is the federal government still not coming clean about criminal aliens who have killed and maimed Americans? More to the point, who are these coverups really protecting?<br>

		<p>This was the #1 news story in America when it was believed the killer was a white congressman.</p>
<p>When the murderer was revealed to be a 3rd World illegal alien the mainstream media said &#8220;Move along. Nothing to see here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The USA can not forever continue to intake this level of racial detritus and maintain Civilization!</p>
<p>During much better times the USA had a nordicist immigration policy and at the very least we need to return to a White immigration policy (perhaps taking in Afikaners?)</p>

		<p>The problem lies with the mass media propaganda machine.  They could turn this into the biggest news story in the country for days if they so desired.  Unfortunately, however, there are aspects of this case which conflict with the official party line.</p>

		<p>The mainstream newsmedia just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of Chandra Levy when they thought her killer was white congressman Gary Condit. In the summer of 2001 he was positively persecuted and witch-hunted by reporters. Day after day it was an endless, merciless media bombardment. Then when it turns out he had nothing to do with any of it, that the true killer was a non-white illegal alien, the whole story just melts away. No apologies, retractions, nothing. Just move along folks, nothing to see here. </p>
