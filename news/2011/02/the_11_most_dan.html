<h1>The 11 Most Dangerous Cities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Danielle Kurtzleben, Yahoo! News, February 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Property crime is far more prevalent than violent crime in all of these cities, as with the rest of the nation, and nearly all of these 11 cities have also experienced significant drops in property crime in recent years. St. Louis, the city with the highest crime risk, has made major strides in the years covered by this index figure, with a property crime rate that has dropped from 13,187 per 100,000 residents in 2003 to 8,331 in 2009. In particular, the city&rsquo;s motor vehicle theft rate dropped by more than half in those seven years. {snip}</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the above figures give an overall view of crime in these cities. Several other cities that have high rates of particular crimes are not among the 11 cities with the worst crime rates. For example, New Orleans and Richmond, Virginia had the highest murder rates in the country in 2009, according to the FBI. Likewise, Anchorage, Alaska, and Abilene, Texas, which are not among the cities with the most overall crime, still had the second- and third-highest rates of forcible rapes in 2009, behind No. 1 Minneapolis.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, a diverse array of factors can contribute to a city&rsquo;s crime rates, including population density, transportation trends, economic health, and even climate.<br>

		<p>At least we have something on which to hang our hats.</p>
<p>St. Louis&rsquo;s car theft rate used to be high, because young black men used to view other people&rsquo;s cars as a means of public transportation   &mdash;   The deal was they&rsquo;d be taken to someone&rsquo;s house for some sort of party, and when the party was over, their first ride had already left, or didn&rsquo;t want to cart them around to their next destination.  So they&rsquo;d hoist a car on the block and use that to drive home, or wherever they wanted to go next.</p>
<p>It got so bad at one point that the city police chief started a program where the legit car owner could put a sticker on the rear windshield, and this gave the cops permission to pull the car over between 1 am and 5 am to make sure the legit owner was driving it.  Problem was, this was happening at the same time they started restricting police chases, so the stickers were moot because all the thieves had to do was hit the gas, and they&rsquo;d be in the clear.  So much for the sticker.</p>

		<p>Except for Kansas City and Minneapolis, the non-hispanic white population was below 50% for these high crime cities.  When the 2010 census data is released, even these two cities will probably fall below 50%.</p>
<p>But you will never hear the politically correct media present this data in such a format.  They will always blame some nondescript demographic such as poverty rate.</p>

<p>Allow me to proffer a plausible explanation for the more than 50%drop in vehicle thefts in St. Louis from &#8216;03 to &#8216;09. Did it ever occur to anybody that the number of vehicles available in St. Louis for stealing declined precipituously over the interval in question? As in they were either all stolen and/or their owners just fled St. Louis?</p>

		<p>From 1980 to 1990 the prison population in the United States increased from 315,974 to 739,980. The crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants declined from 5,950.0 to 5,820.3. <br>
 <br>
From 1990 to 2000 the prison population grew to 1,428,187. The crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants declined to 4,124.8. It has continued to decline to 3,465.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2009.<br>

 <br>
In their book Freakonomics Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt argue that the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 is the main reason for the decline in the crime rate since 1990. This is because the kind of females who are likely to have abortions are the same kind who are likely to have boy babies who grow up to become criminals: they are unmarried, poor, and poorly educated. <br>
 <br>
Blacks have an abortion rate that is three times the white rate. Unmarried women have an abortion rate that is 8.8 times the rate for married women.  </p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take statistics from the St Louis Police Department at face value. It is well known that St Louis City Police had a policy of turning wine into water with crime stats by downgrading offenses to less serious crimes, or simply unfounding crimes committed where an insurance claim was unlikely to result. They even went as far as making rapes, and sexual assaults disappear before people within the department started to speak about it publicly.  </p>
<p>Of course, the stats games do not go away for long even when a little light is shown on them. People wont go downtown if they don&rsquo;t feel safe, even to a hockey or baseball game. So they have to lie bigger, and property crime is an easy place to downgrade. Burglary becomes trespass &amp; property damage, grand larceny becomes petty larceny at the stroke of a pen&hellip;etc They do similar games with violent crime such as assaults with a deadly weapon becoming simple assault. </p>
<p>Even if you do take those numbers at face value, for property crimes that are serious enough to actually generate a report, and don&rsquo;t get downgraded almost 1:10 residents is going to suffer a serious property crime every year. Considering how rare apartment insurance is within the city, the police policy of downgrading, and the general apathy of residents to reporting crimes   &mdash;   the actual number is probably closer to 1:3 to 1:4. </p>
<p>My house was broken into when I lived in the city. Vehicles were vandalized repeatedly. I grew tired of it. Tired of the trash being thrown into the back of my truck, and on my lawn. Tired of having my garage broken into. Tired of repairing windows, and car mirrors. Tired of knowing one of these days my luck would run out, and I would again be faced with a mugger, or multiple attackers, and I might not have a weapon on me to even the odds. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a single friend who still lives within the city that hasn&rsquo;t had a vehicle stolen. Many have been mugged, some have been violently attacked to the point of needing to be hospitalized. I&rsquo;ve yet to have anyone I know killed there who was just going about their business, but I had a friend who caught a stray bullet a few blocks from the opera house, and is lucky to still be us. </p>
<p>Its one thing to talk about it in the abstract, but its enough to experience it. Its such a slow erosion that we accept things getting worse over time, and it becomes the new normal. It was not until I left for Germany in the 90&rsquo;s, and then came back to St Louis that I realized how truly dismal, filthy, and appalling my hometown had become. I never felt that way in Hamburg, Germany. I never felt like I had to have a weapon me all of the time, to always have my guard up, to always scan the area around me, and be conscious of who was there.  I took it for granted I would come home, and my stuff would still be there, my vehicle untouched, my family safe, and that order &amp; civility would prevail at nearly all times. </p>

<p>Oh, I see now. The results included &#8220;property crimes&#8221;. Well, property crimes aren&rsquo;t really &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; now are they? If they had limited the crimes to rape, murder and violent assaults I&rsquo;m sure Memphis would have placed much higher. Probably 1st or 2nd. Yeah. It is that bad here. I&rsquo;m not saying you would automatically be attacked the first time go to the wrong area. But you won&rsquo;t get by with it too many times before you are.</p>

		<p>4:  The time scale between 2003 and 2007 was that of the highest rate of yuppie gentrification and rehabbing in St. Louis City.  I would imagine that so many black car thieves, obviously resulting in high car insurance rates in most city zip codes, implored people to do whatever they can within reason to make it hard to steal their cars.  I know that I saw a lot of existing houses either having their garages re-habbed, or garages built where there were none before.  Mainly I think to keep their cars at night in order to get lower insurance rates.</p>
<p>8 Salt:  I know about the stat stuffing scandal (highly underreported around here, BTW).  It&rsquo;s possible that St. Louis seems to have so many &#8220;minor&#8221; crimes when they are in reality &#8220;major&#8221; crimes downgraded to &#8220;minor&#8221; on police paperwork.  However, I always though the stat stuffing scandal related almost entirely to downgrading &#8220;major&#8221; crimes to not a crime at all.  For instance, a dead body lying around was not classified as a homicide but a &#8220;natural cause&#8221; death.  Sure, I know a lot of 20-year old men who die of the &#8220;natural cause&#8221; of round puncture wounds on their bodies.</p>
<p>More than that, though, if you think it&rsquo;s bad now, then realize that it seems like the local control bill up in Jefferson City seems to have no obstacles.</p>

<p>A possible,and I think plausible explanation for the rape rate in Abilene,Texas,is that Abilene is right next door to Dyess Air Force Base.</p>
<p>I doubt that the racial makeup of the AF mirrors that of the Army-the Air Force was always somewhat picky about who got to join than some other branches. But I don&rsquo;t for a moment doubt that blacks are overrepresented in the enlisted ranks of the Air Force,just like they are in the rest of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>So,the simplest,and most obvious answer to an otherwise difficult to explain phenomena is that the black enlisted types at Dyess are hopping the fence at night and looking for recreation in ways that they find familiar.</p>
<p>I really wish I wasn&rsquo;t right,but I&rsquo;d bet my next safety bonus that I am.</p>

		<p>The problem in Alaska is probably the natives.  In Canada by far the highest murder rates are in the far north, among the Inuit.   A large portion of the Inuit are alcoholics, though it is not politically correct to notice.  They seem to have a genetic tendency to addiction.  I don&rsquo;t know whether the problems with crime would diminish if the alcoholism could some how be cured, but surely it would help.  </p>
<p>There is also a lot of violent crime in more southern communities that have a lot of natives.  </p>

<p>Looks like the naive FBI didn&rsquo;t include race in their &#8220;diverse array of factors.&#8221;  And they didn&rsquo;t, of course, because they&rsquo;re as handicapped by diversity as the federal government who has more incompetents per square inch than a nation of Forest Gumps.</p>
<p>But, besides race, the greatest precursor to chaotic crime is economic hard times, which, incidentally just happens to be occurring right now, with all indicators pointing to an acceleration the closer we get to 2012 and beyond, especially in the cities cited above.  Camden and Newark, among other metro areas have had to lay off numerous police personnel.  That too will increase dramatically and will soon be the norm from sea to shining sea.</p>
<p>Fewer jobs, fewer police, fewer opportunities for work, all translate to out of control crime, so if the FBI thinks the above cities are dangerous right now, they need to revisit the problem in about a year and let us know what they think of the situation then.  Many are saying our metro areas will have kidnappings, car jackings, robberies and murders even worse than Mexico City does right now, which is pretty bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can do much about it either.  The present decline is irreversible. </p>
<p>Sometime around 2014 the crime situation in 2011 will seem like the good old days.  That&rsquo;s not only my analysis it is EXACTLY what many high profile experts are saying right now. </p>
<p>And I might mention I&rsquo;m not a gloom and doom pessimist.  I&rsquo;m a realist. <br>

		<p>Minneapolis is not that shocking. Voluntary agencies and church groups have been going out of their way for years now to bring in Sudanese and Somalis. The better-than-average welfare benefits and ease of getting a taxi or public transportation also make the area attractive to blacks moving in from other states.</p>
<p>Minneapolis has been referred to as &#8220;Murderapolis&#8221; for years now. Its just something that people not from the area are unaware of.</p>

		<p>Is Indianapolis as dangerous as some of these other cities, probably not, but there is still a lot of crime here. if you look at the interactive maps of murders, they tend to be concentrated in a few areas. However, in areas that were considered &#8220;safe&#8221; just 10 years ago, there are nightly reports of parking lot hold-ups, gas station robberies, ATM stick-ups, and so on. An Indianapolis police officer was recently murdered by a 60 yo felon with a rap sheet a mile long. This occurred in a neighborhood that was probably all white 40 - 50 years ago (near 34th &amp; Keystone). Not a good idea to drive through there at night now. </p>
<p>The police chief recently went begging on his hands and knees for forgiveness from the &#8220;Concerned Clergy&#8221; because a not too bright mulatto got his bell rung by the cops. Needless to say, he is not much liked by the rank and file. </p>
<p>Indianapolis is still a predominantly white city, but only because the borders were expanded to the edge of Marion County in the 1960&rsquo;s. You could fit Chicago, Pittsburgh and St. Louis in the city limits of Indianapolis. This is not a densely packed town. In 1967, the only way those who lived in the outlying townships would agree to Unigov was to leave certain things alone. The school districts are frozen at their 1967 borders. Indianapolis does have a VERY extensive private school system. You know up front that if you buy houses in certain areas, just go ahead and write out the check for (Cathedral, Brebeuf Jesuit, Roncalli, Park Tudor, etc). It ought to be telling how many big box stores are located outside of the 465 ring. (Most of them). </p>
<p>From an article in the local fishwrap (aka the Indianapolis Star). 02/20/2011</p>
<p>&#8220;According to census data released this month, the five fastest-growing counties in the state all are neighbors of Marion County.</p>
<p>Hamilton County&rsquo;s population jumped 50 percent, and Hendricks County grew 40 percent since 2000. Marion County grew about 5 percent.</p>
<p>The shift, experts say, has been driven by jobs, housing and quality-of-life issues such as schools, parks and lower crime rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are moving out of Center Township and going to suburbs, and that leaves empty properties,&#8221; said Olgen Williams, Indianapolis&rsquo; deputy mayor for the Office of Neighborhoods.</p>
<p>At last count, there are 9,000 to 10,000 abandoned houses in Indianapolis. Last year, the city demolished 675 of them, and it plans to tear down at least 250 more this year.&#8221;</p>

Anyone who lives in Indy has heard of Olgen Williams. Williams got into trouble back in the early 70&rsquo;s for stealing money from the mail (he was briefly a mailman) to support his drug habit. Now he is the deputy mayor and has a long history of &#8220;good works&#8221;. This guy, at least, appears to care for the black community, but I have never heard a &#8220;Bill Cosby&#8221; moment out of him. If you live in Center Township, you are stuck with IPS schools unless you can buy your way out. That is one of the 800 lb. elephants that no one will talk about. </p>

		<p>#8 How true about the nature of statistics.  The statement, &#8220;Things are worse than they seem&#8221; can be readily explained by the law enforcement experience in the Southern Capital City in which I live.  For a number of years the left leaning city commission was enthralled by diversity.  So with the hiring of a barely qualified black police chief everyone was just so happy as the crime rate was decreasing.  Over time, many citizens started comparing experiences with the reporting of crimes.  And what we were discovering was a great reluctance to take reports.  I experienced one such instance when my vehicle was burglarized.  Minor items were missing with no damage (from an unlockable jeep) so I just phoned in a report or tried to do so.  The black female sargent responsible for taking my information just was never available.  Later when the police chief was promoted by the governor to head the state Department of Corrections, a new white police chief suddenly announced that we had a gang problem and that greater attention to reporting crimes was a goal.  Insiders told me that during this black police chief&rsquo;s reign FBI Uniform Crime Statistics Reporting was lax and that crimes were simply never reported. And this is what I fear almost as much as the rising crime rates, we will never be sure if what is reported is as bad as reality.  As other posters have said, these stats just don&rsquo;t look right.  And how long before an eric holder will just print what he and his boss want him to do anyway?</p>

<p>Blacks commit half the rapes in this country. How in the world can Minneapolis, Anchorage, and Abilene be tops in rapes. Something isn&rsquo;t right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of Minneapolis, I suspect it is due to the mixture of a sizeable black minority (including now many somalis) and a large population of naive white liberals.  It&rsquo;s Lake Wobegon vs. the &#8216;Hood.</p>

		<p>The crime rates have decreased for one reason only - increased gun ownership. The November that Obama was elected, the increase in the total number of guns purchased was 450,000 - as in almost a half a million. And, once again, that wasn&rsquo;t the total number of guns bought that November, that was the INCREASE in the total number. About TWENTY TIMES the normal increase&hellip;for ONE month.</p>
<p>So it seems that clinging to guns and religion isn&rsquo;t quite as foolish as Barry once made it sound.  </p>

		<p>I reside in Orlando, and can say that I do not believe the city itself to be one of the most dangerous.  Unlike most cities on this list, the neighborhoods just east of downtown like Colonialtown, Eola Park and the like are quite gentrified.  I have walked around these places at night and have never felt in danger.  In fact, there&rsquo;s a section in that that is known as Vietnamtown.  The bad areas of the city proper are mostly west of downtown, which was unsurprisingly designated as black during segregation.  If you want dangerous, try walking around the city of Buffalo, NY or Jackson, MS at night.</p>

		<p>Before moving to or even visiting ANY community, remember that it is possible to check demographic data. There is a website that publishes the census data. You can see the breakdown of race and crime and many other things there. The safest communities happen to also be the ones with a majority white population. To find the site, do a simple search. I don&rsquo;t know if it is okay with the moderator to mention the site name. I don&rsquo;t want to be mistaken as a spammer.<br>
Using the site to study communities, it is scary to see the demographic change in many areas that were once majority white communities.<br>
In closing, we can take back our cities. If whites moved en masse into the cities we once fled and became the majority once again in those places they will become safe, beautiful places once more. Until then, let them decay to the point they no longer exist. Then, when the non-whites who have ruined them go elsewhere, we can rebuild our cities from scratch.</p>
