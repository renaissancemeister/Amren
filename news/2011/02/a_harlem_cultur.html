<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/arts/design/01harlem.html">A Harlem Cultural Hub Is Threatened by Debt</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Flynn and Felicia R. Lee, New York Times, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2002 the National Black Theater, a cultural anchor of Harlem, invited the owners of Nubian Heritage, a growing beauty-care company with an African pedigree, to invest in its sprawling building at Fifth Avenue and 125th Street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} For the businessmen, two former street vendors from Liberia, the building provided a flagship store in a historic neighborhood.</p>
<p>Nine years later, though, the store is closed; the partnership owes nearly $1.8 million in unpaid property taxes; and the theater is facing foreclosure yet again, a plight it blames on its partners, men it once embraced as kindred spirits and now in court accuses of mismanagement and fraud.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
But Ms. Teer&rsquo;s [Barbara Ann Teer, the theater&rsquo;s founder] two children, who have run the theater since their mother died nearly three years ago, accuse their partners of leveraging the value of the theater&rsquo;s building to secure funds for their other businesses and saddling it with debt.</p>

		<p>it&rsquo;s called Business Law 101.  DON&rsquo;T GET INTO A PARTNERSHIP!  Not under any circumstances.  It is a well known fact to anyone who has the slightest clue about business that a partnership is an outdated entity that simply invites trouble from unscrupulous partners.  I&rsquo;m sure these &#8220;two former street vendors from Liberia&#8221; came with outstanding business credentials and professional references, but please take the time to look into incorporation or at least an LLC.</p>

		<p>Blacks thought that Obama was the beginning of a whole new<br>
era of free money, racial pandering, and white servility.<br>
Wrong. Obama was the end, not the beginning. Whites see<br>
that the Civil Rights project has come to its stopping point with<br>
a black President. There will be no more funding of black projects of any kind. This is what all the taxpayer revolt is<br>
about. No more social welfare spending. Blacks are on their own<br>
after 50 years of pandering. We have done what we could but the<br>
game is over.</p>

		<p>Wow. Who woulda thought you couldn&rsquo;t trust &#8220;two former street vendors from Liberia&#8221; with your bank account?</p>
<p>I just never saw this coming.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;DO NOT GET INTO A PARTNERSHIP!!&#8221; Oh yeah&hellip;I can sum up this position in three words, CACTUS BEER GARDEN!! I had two coke cowboys fawning over my mom`s inheritance to help open their nighclub B-B-Q joint.<br>
  They bought me a $50.00 lunch to help fatten me up and then started driving me to my bank. Thier plan, a $15,000 investment on my part. When they were almost to the parking lot one of them made an off hand comment, &#8220;Timmy barking with the big dogs now!!&#8221;  For some reason it smacked of blandishment and  solidified all the doubts about them and BBQ and live music&hellip; So I jumped out of the car at a stop light and threw $100.00 in to pay for lunch&hellip;<br>
  Opening night they had quite a crowd, but a customer walked up to me and said, &#8220;You must be glad you didn`t spend your inheritence on one night of fun!!&#8221;  I was. Six months later the bar closed due to squabbling among partners and raids on the register and refrigerator for money and meat. <br>
  I spent the money on a trip to Tahiti and some nautical antiques. Years later one of the &#8220;partners&#8221; admitted to me (rare for him) that I was right and he was wrong!! He said what hurt most was the memory of getting involved and getting burned which would last a lifetime, long after the money, and the bar and the partnership were long forgotton&hellip;</p>

		<p>I really get tired of blacks boasting about how &#8216;cultural&rsquo; they are - and even worse, the idiotic whites who beckon and bow to their complaining ! I personally, consider my self FAR BEYOND the cultural level of any black on the planet. I have blood from about 15 different nations running through my veins. Now how does that compare to a black from one country ? I&rsquo;ve traveled to almost every region of the world. How many blacks can say that ?</p>
<p>If you want to crucify one of this cultural hypocrites, ask them how often they&rsquo;ve traveled to Africa. </p>
<p>You will get a look of dismay and shock from them - it&rsquo;s hilarious. They WILL respond - &#8220;Why would I ever want to go there ?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re proud of their culture all right. Just another reason to beg the government for more money.</p>
