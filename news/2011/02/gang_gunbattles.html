<h1>Gang Gunbattles, Street Blockades in Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arturo Perez, Forbes, February 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Suspected drug cartel gunmen hurled grenades, burned vehicles and blocked streets in a rapid series of attacks in Mexico&rsquo;s second-largest city [Guadalajara], authorities said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The seven attacks within two hours late Tuesday appear to have been coordinated, and were staged by drug gangs, possibly in retaliation for the arrests of their members, said Fernando Guzman Perez, interior secretary of Jalisco state, where the city of Guadalajara is located. A policeman and two transportation workers were injured in the attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other attacks took place Tuesday in the northern cities of Zacatecas and Monterrey, resulting in several deaths. Those attacks did not appear to be coordinated.</p>
<p>In Zacatecas, gunmen opened fire on state police officers who had arrived after receiving a tip that armed men were parked outside an office-supply store, the government of Zacatecas state said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another series of attacks Tuesday in Mexico&rsquo;s third-largest city and its suburbs left a federal police officer and three suspected cartel gunmen dead and three police officers injured, said Jorge Domene, public security spokesman for the state of Nuevo Leon, where the city of Monterrey is located.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In one of the assaults, gunmen driving a black sport utility vehicle opened fire on police officers in a patrol car in the suburb of Monterrey Apodaca, killing one and wounding three. Assailants exchanged fire with the police for several blocks before they holed up in a drug store. Another gunfight ensued before the suspects were captured. Police did not say how many were taken into custody.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, assailants hurled a grenade at a municipal police checkpoint in Monterrey, but the officers were able to get out of their patrol car before it exploded. It was the third time a grenade has been thrown at checkpoints in Monterrey since they were set up last month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a separate Monterrey suburb Tuesday, three suspected drug gang gunmen were killed in a shootout with federal police, said police commander Manuel Jesus Uco Limon.</p>
<p>January was the bloodiest month of drug violence in recent history in Monterrey. According to public security office figures, more than 120 people were killed as a result of organized crime, including 21 police officers.<br>

		<p>Great examples of Mexican heritage.  We just cant get enough of these fine people in our country, thats why our economy is failing.  OK, enough, what really gets me is the FBI considers mexicans to be white, thus massively inflating what is considered &#8220;white crime.&#8221;</p>
