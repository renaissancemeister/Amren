<h1>Alarming Statistic: Black Babies Die Before 1st Birthday Twice As Often As White Babies in Palm Beach County</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Leslie Gray Streeter, Palm Beach Post, February 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tonya Lewis Lee has an uncomfortable statistic to share  &mdash;  the United States ranks 29th among industrialized nations in infant mortality.</p>
<p>She lets that unpleasant news hang in the air for a second, probably because she wants everyone, from world health agencies to governments to corporations to parents, to be so uncomfortable that they want to do something about it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state of health of women and babies, said Lee, resonates not just through the African-American community, which she serves as the spokeswoman for A Healthy Baby Begins With You, an initiative of the Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; Office of Minority Health, but throughout the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The goal of A Healthy Baby Begins With You, which began in 2007, is to increase the awareness and prevention of infant mortality, particularly in the African-American and minority communities. That crisis is seen locally as well  &mdash;  in 2009, the infant mortality rate overall in Palm Beach County was 6.1 deaths per every 1,000, but 10.9 deaths per 1,000 for African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are surprised by that, and assume that we&rsquo;re talking about poor people. But it reflects all economic levels,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The most well-to-do black woman is more likely to deal with infant mortality than the poorest white woman. It&rsquo;s part of the stress of being a black woman in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>INFANT DEATH: A GRIM PICTURE</p>
<p>The U.S. ranks 29th among industrialized nations in infant mortality.</p>
<p>In 2007, the infant mortality rate in Palm Beach County was 8.7 deaths per 1,000, but was 13.2 per 1,000 for African-Americans.</p>
<p>In 2009, the infant mortality rate for PBC per 1,000 births fell to 6.1 overall, and 10.9 percent for African-Americans. <br>

I totally agree with this statement and to solve the problem I ask, no I claim for less diversity and more separation! If it is so hard for a black woman to live together with whites, there can&rsquo;t be another solution.</p>

		<p>What a horribly written article. No cause for higher numbers mentioned here or in the original article. I guess the time when journalists did research is coming to an end. </p>
<p>Anyway, the original article talks for about three paragraphs about mothers not eating enough vegetables. I suspect the difference in the black and white infant mortality statistics has more to do with drug use /drinking /smoking by the mother, physical abuse of the mother during pregnancy, or physical abuse or neglect of the baby when it&rsquo;s born. Veggies won&rsquo;t help that. </p>

<p>&hellip;but not the &#8220;African-American community&#8221; itself, apparently. That&rsquo;s apparent from her later statement, where she attributes infant mortality to &#8220;the stress of being a black woman in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seem to recall reading that psychological surveys have found that blacks actually report less stress than whites. But let&rsquo;s not let that get in the way of a good &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; story.</p>

		<p>From this article, my guess is that this Mrs. Lee is in the talented 10th. This sets her apart from most blacks. The wealthiest blacks tend to be entertainers and athletes, not corporate CEO&rsquo;s and investment bankers. As for being an entertainer or athlete, that kind of profession has a pretty short shelf life. Her husband, Spike Lee, is an entertainer, but has crafted a pretty decent niche as a successful director. (Whether or not you care for his movies, he is arguably successful). If you look at a picture of her, she has a LOT of white ancestors. </p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has done a correlation between being married and infant mortality? Let us just assume for a moment that Mrs. Lee is a responsible person. No drugs, Newport smokes, hitting the Private Stock, etc. while she was pregnant. Maybe the likelihood of infant mortality in her household is about the same as a middle class white couple. This doesn&rsquo;t exactly scream racism if you are acting RESPONSIBLY.  </p>
<p>&#8220;People are surprised by that, and assume that we&rsquo;re talking about poor people. But it reflects all economic levels,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The most well-to-do black woman is more likely to deal with infant mortality than the poorest white woman. It&rsquo;s part of the stress of being a black woman in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this may not be the case for Mrs. Lee (and she would be in rarefied company if this is true). Maybe that stress results from knowing that your man is more likely to be incarcerated than working a regular job. Or the fact that he has a few outside kids. How about the stress of never being able to pay your bills even though you make the same as your white co-worker.  You have never heard her complain about bills. (It&rsquo;s a conspiracy, white people can magically create money to pay bills)! Maybe there is the stress of being carjacked, worrying about home invasion burglaries, and myriad other crimes. </p>
<p>What happens when they roll out the statistics that middle class female Asians have lower infant mortality rates that rich White women? Out of a 1000 women who do everything right, there exists the possibility that something will go wrong in a couple of cases. I wonder if blacks in 2011 have higher mortality rates than whites in say, 1961 (think of the state of medical technology then). If they did have lower rates than the 1961 whites, they are free to thank white people for all of this wonderful technology they get to use. If they don&rsquo;t, it is not the fault of whitey.  </p>

		<p>Blacks mature faster than whites, they have more robust bodies and they die younger.  These same characteristics allowed them to thrive in the harsh tropical climate of equatorial Africa.  This is simply due to biology, not &#8220;stress&#8221; or &#8220;racism.&#8221;  Nothing will change the unfortunate fact that their children are more prone to SIDS.  Of course the press can&rsquo;t mention this fact, since it goes against their &#8220;all are equal&#8221; narrative.  </p>
<p>And as anonymous #2 said, poor lifestyle choices don&rsquo;t help matters much, either.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m hardly an Ob/Gyn, but I have read and heard about the rough scientific and biomechanical processes of child gestation and child birth.  In order for a healthy baby to be born normally, so many things have go right, both simultaneously and consecutively.  In fact, it&rsquo;s such a complicated process that it&rsquo;s a wonder how any human child or any mammal for that matter reproduces successfully.  Point is, any perfidy (drugs, alcohol, smoking, etc) is far more dangerous than just doing it to yourself as a non-expecting individual.</p>

		<p>A neonatologist told me just the opposite. According to him (and he&rsquo;s been in the business a long time) black females were the hardiest babies and more apt to survive than any other race. <br>

		<p>A propos, an anecdote - My wife just told me today that her niece Alice was pregnant.  My wife found out about her pregnancy despite her niece wanting to keep her pregnancy a secret. </p>
<p>This is the story: When visiting her elder sister, Alice was offered a glass of wine, which she accepted. When Alice&rsquo;s sister observed that Alice hadn&rsquo;t drunk from her glass her big sister exclaimed, you&rsquo;re pregnant!   To which Alice could not avoid confessing the truth of her pregnancy.<br>
My observation is that Alice&rsquo;s pregnancy became obvious to her elder sister because of Alice&rsquo;s sudden and unusual abstinence from wine!  Her sister suspected that Alice&rsquo;s sudden abstinence had appeared because she wanted to protect her unborn child from the harmful effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>Now, am quite sure that this pattern is not exclusively Scandinavian, however I am just as sure that this pattern isn&rsquo;t typical of certain other cultures – I leave it up to the reader to imagine what I mean by that<br>

<p>Lets look at the data shall we?:</p>

<p>So from Ms. Lee&rsquo;s rationale it would appear that Asians, Mexicans, Cubans, and Central/South Americans in the US suffer less stress and racism than Whites. </p>
<p><br>
The figures for life expectancy and infant mortality for Whites and Blacks are often compared, but the figures for Latinos and Asians are frequently left out because the results don&rsquo;t follow the assumed racial paradigm. Asians and Latinos outlive non-Hispanic Whites and have lower infant mortality rates. (The exception for Latinos are Puerto Ricans&hellip;.who have a somewhat higher infant mortality rate than Whites..given that a fairly high portion of Puerto Ricans are part Black&hellip;. do you there could be any possibility that it could due to genetics&hellip;? I won&rsquo;t be holding my breath for that study.)</p>

<p>Not all countries measure infant mortality in the same way as the US: <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-doctor-is-in-infant-mortality-comparisons-a-statistical-miscarriage/" rel="nofollow">http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/the-doctor-is-in-infant-mortality-comparisons-a-statistical-miscarriage/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;But in fact, the main factors affecting early infant survival are birth weight and prematurity. The way that these factors are reported  &mdash;  and how such babies are treated statistically  &mdash;  tells a different story than what the numbers reveal.</p>
<p>Low birth weight infants are not counted against the &ldquo;live birth&rdquo; statistics for many countries reporting low infant mortality rates.</p>
<p>According to the way statistics are calculated in Canada, Germany, and Austria, a premature baby weighing 
<p>But in the U.S., such very low birth weight babies are considered live births. The mortality rate of such babies  &mdash;  considered &ldquo;unsalvageable&rdquo; outside of the U.S. and therefore never alive  &mdash;  is extraordinarily high; up to 869 per 1,000 in the first month of life alone. This skews U.S. infant mortality statistics.</p>
<p>When Canada briefly registered an increased number of low weight babies previously omitted from statistical reporting, the infant mortality rose from 6.1 per 1,000 to 6.4 per thousand in just one year.</p>
<p>According to research done by Canada&rsquo;s Bureau of Reproductive and Child Health, &ldquo;Comparisons of infant mortality rates by place and time should be adjusted for the proportion of such live births, especially if the comparisons involve recent years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norway boasts one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world. But when the main determinant of mortality  &mdash;  weight at birth  &mdash;  is factored in, Norway has no better survival rates than the United States.&#8221;</p></p>

		<p>Speaking of my earlier post about infant mortality rates. </p>
<p>According to the Dept of Health and Human Services, non-Hispanic white infant mortality in 2006 was 5.6 per 1000 and non-Hispanic blacks was 13.4 per 1000. The overall rate was 7.0/1000. What I could find for 1961 was the rate in the US was 25.4/1000. (I didn&rsquo;t find a breakdown by race). </p>
<p>Granted, in 1961, you had cigarette ads on TV and could smoke in a lot more places. We may not have known of the benefits of folic acid. Nobody wore seat belts and there probably weren&rsquo;t infant car seats like we have now. Mom/grandma probably did a lot of things during their pregnancy that most women wouldn&rsquo;t do now. </p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. ranks 29th among industrialized nations in infant mortality.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many of those countries have higher percentages of whites than the US? </p>

		<p>Poster # 5 has summed up the biological realities of the situation.  Even though tomes have been written on this subject, his succinct and short statements regarding the physical developments of blacks and the evolutionary reasons why they exhibit these characteristics are the truth.  No amount of PC propaganda will ever alter these facts.</p>
