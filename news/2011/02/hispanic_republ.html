<h1>Hispanic Republicans Tone Down Immigration Talk</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Root, Houston Chronicle, February 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As a Republican, Rep. Aaron Pena is expected to take a hard line on immigration. But as a Latino who represents a heavily Hispanic district along the U.S.-Mexico border, the South Texas lawyer finds some of the anti-immigrant proposals in the Legislature to be unfair and unnecessarily harsh.</p>
<p>Pena is among a handful of new Latino Republicans in the Texas Legislature, and they are taking a careful walk through the minefield of hot-button immigration and cultural wedge issues that are sure to spark debate, and possibly legal reforms, in the Texas Legislature this year.</p>
<p>Several of them are scheduled to meet as a group Wednesday with Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is helping lead a Latino outreach effort, aides said. Abbott&rsquo;s eventual advice on the legality of some of the immigration bills could be a key factor in what happens to them in the Legislature.</p>
<p>The Hispanic Republicans don&rsquo;t all share the same opinion on every bill. But with generally more moderate views on everything from English-only proposals to legislation that would deny birth certificates to illegal immigrants&rsquo; children, the lawmakers are challenging the GOP to think in news ways about issues that stir Hispanic passions.</p>
<p>Pena, for example, thinks it&rsquo;s an awful idea to deny illegal immigrants the right to sue in state court. He said the measure, sponsored by GOP Rep. Leo Berman of Tyler, would invite unwarranted abuse against people, even if they are here illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Rep. John Garza of San Antonio, worries that the heated rhetoric surrounding the immigration issue could hurt Republicans like him in 2012. Garza squeaked out a narrow, upset victory in November against a Democrat in a district that is 64 percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In my district, immigration was down on the bottom of the totem pole in terms of issues,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need to be inclusive if we want to gain the Hispanic vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garza is among the lawmakers joining the Hispanic Republican Conference, which Pena chairs. The group, formed last week, plans to take positions on specific immigration bills and other issues if two-thirds of its members agree, Pena said. The group includes six members who identify themselves as Hispanic and three Anglos in districts that are at least 40 percent Hispanic.</p>
<p>Abbott, whose wife is Hispanic, will meet with the conference and swear them in as new members, Pena said. In past legislative sessions, Abbott informed legislators that some of the initiatives aimed at illegal immigrants represented unlawful interference with federal authority.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Hispanics have traditionally voted Democratic, Abbott and other Republicans said the election of several new Republican Hispanics  &mdash;  there were none two years ago  &mdash;  shows that the GOP and the growing Hispanic population share conservative values.</p>

		<p>Well, if the hispanic population is &#8220;conservative&#8221; then what are these hispanic representatives worried about?  Fact is, their constituents are NOT conservative when it comes to illegal immigrants.  At least, not those in their heavily hispanic districts.<br>
I&rsquo;m not so sure the Republican Party can be called &#8220;conservative&#8221; anymore.  The new Tea Party and Independent Republicans who ran and won against mainstream republicans might be.  We&rsquo;ll see.  But the Republican Party?  Any conservativism they are displaying is due to being in fear for their jobs, given the thumping they received as a party this past election.  Any conservatism they are showing is only because they HAVE to show some.  Let&rsquo;s make hay while the sun shines.  Get some of these things passed as quickly as possible.  If for no other reason, so America knows who next to vote out of office in 2012.</p>

		<p>As we all know, the political parties have imploded and are meaningless except for one thing: currently one still has to be &#8216;officially&rsquo; aligned with one party or the other to have a viable chance of electability. Once elected the true allegiance of a politician becomes visible and in fact, moves to the forefront of his or her agenda. For everyone except the liberal whites their one and only allegiance is their race or heritage. Period. Nothing else matters. The liberal whites are totally unexplainable to me.</p>

		<p>Hispanic voters aren&rsquo;t that conservative.  The highest share of the Hispanic vote in a given state any Republican Presidential candidate has gotten is Bush 43&rsquo;s low 40s in Texas and Florida in 2004.  I know it&rsquo;s been awhile since I&rsquo;ve taken any math classes, but I do know that 41% doesn&rsquo;t win you any elections in races where there are only two credible candidates.</p>
