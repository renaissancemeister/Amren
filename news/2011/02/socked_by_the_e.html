<p>By 2012, UFE predicts, African American neighborhoods could be drained of nearly $200 billion in housing losses alone. That&rsquo;s close to the gross national product of some small nations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the more provocative new studies, by Princeton researchers Jacob Rugh and Douglas S. Massey, suggests that a big reason black communities are being hit disproportionately hard is because they are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, black communities.</p>
<p>That makes them easy targets for predatory lenders, the authors say. Blacks who have been underserved are going to be more desperate for a home  &mdash;  even ones they can&rsquo;t afford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put, the greater the degree of Hispanic and especially black segregation a metropolitan area exhibits, the higher the number and rate of foreclosures,&#8221; the authors say.</p>
<p>The solution? Spread out, black people; scatter, if you can. Maybe it&rsquo;s better to rent in an integrated neighborhood, with good schools and more job opportunities, than to own in a black one where property values aren&rsquo;t going to rise that much and may vanish altogether if your neighbor goes into foreclosure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obviously, many of us couldn&rsquo;t see well enough to carefully read those fliers posted on utility poles advertising no-interest subprime mortgage loans. Black neighborhoods throughout the country were targeted like crazy, as Massey and Rugh note, with billboards, robocalls, door-to-door cold calls, handbills under the windshield wipers and more.</p>
<p>But somehow we missed the &#8220;fine print&#8221; on those balloon-loan papers-the itty-bitty type that said: gotcha, sucker. If you already have spectacles, invest in a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prince George&rsquo;s, where I live, is the wealthiest predominately black county in the country and is reeling from the highest foreclosure rate in the state  &mdash;  and one of the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>A report by the Partnership for Renewal in Southern and Central Maryland last year found that nearly half of the county&rsquo;s residents spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, an amount considered unaffordable by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>Prince George&rsquo;s counted 45,300 troubled home loans, according to a report by the Urban Institute, and about 40 percent of renters cannot afford the median monthly rent of $1,131.</p>

<p>I contend that you can&rsquo;t lose what you didn&rsquo;t have to begin with.  The houses are still there (for the most part)   &mdash;   All that has changed is the public perception of the value because of the sane tightening of credit standards, among other reasons.</p>

		<p>I think that those Princeton educrats are on to something! Let&rsquo;s begin this movement by bringing lots of black folks from the Trenton &#8220;hoods&rsquo; to Princeton. The Princeton folks will welcome them and make them feel right at home. They&rsquo;ll also show them how to get rich they way they are. And they won&rsquo;t let them get scammed by those sneaky, low-down, subprime loan salesmen. In fact I think that all of the wealthy white neighborhoods, especially those where the liberal judges and college professors live, should be the first to welcome lots of poor, honest, nice black folk that they can help to make better and smarter citizens out of! A capital idea you Princeton profs! Go to it! Full speed ahead!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think the answer is for blacks to &#8220;spread out&#8221; and live among whites.  Nonsense.  The answer, long term, is for blacks to change their VALUES, stay in school, get some post-high school education that is career-oriented, and DON&rsquo;T have babies before finishing ALL education and getting a decent job.  Anybody who does this is PROBABLY going to be successful, be they black, brown, white, or other.  In other words, apply a bit of common sense - oh, and stay off drugs and alcohol while you&rsquo;re at it.  It really isn&rsquo;t all that hard to see the solution; implementing it, on the other hand, seems to be a lot tougher for blacks than for whites or Asians.  Might be because of values, again&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Actually, this makes sense to me. If Blacks were spread out throughout areas, the less of a concentrated mass they would be.</p>
<p>In places where Blacks were a significant minority, they would more than likely be well behaved and cause little trouble or certainly less trouble than normal.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can rest assured that well schooled White liberals would do everything they could to make sure that these Blacks would have a roof over their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Provocative studies?&#8221; This is merely conventional wisdom masquerading as bold thought.</p>
<p><i>That makes them easy targets for predatory lenders, the authors say. Blacks who have been underserved are going to be more desperate for a home &mdash; even ones they can&rsquo;t afford.</i></p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s those evil predatory lenders who are to blame&hellip;that old debbil whitey, as usual. It has nothing to do with the fact that blacks tend not to keep up their property as well as whites.</p>
<p>And as far as spreading blacks out among white neighborhoods, that would never work, because it couldn&rsquo;t occur without the government controlling where blacks can live, and as we all know that would be racist! Plus, it overlooks the fact that blacks by and large prefer living among their own race, just as whites do.</p>
<p>Just more distractionary tactics by the MSM.</p>

		<p>Here we go again.  It&rsquo;s all Whitey&rsquo;s fault that blacks took out loans they couldn&rsquo;t pay.  I said it before in another thread and I&rsquo;ll say it again   &mdash;   if they were such good credit risks but &#8220;racist&#8221; white owned banks wouldn&rsquo;t give them fair terms why didn&rsquo;t rich blacks create a bank and plug that hole in the market?  I think we all know the answer to that question   &mdash;   rich blacks know better than anybody else what sort of credit risks their deadbeat cousins and former homie neighbors are.</p>
<p>The true racism is exhibited by the liberals, who take it as a given that we can&rsquo;t expect blacks to be grown ups, and actually read the terms of their mortgages before they sign up.  Also, a little common sense would help.  If you can only &#8220;afford&#8221; a house because you&rsquo;re getting a low teaser rate up front that will later increase, shouldn&rsquo;t you take that as an indication that you really can&rsquo;t afford the house?  Shouldn&rsquo;t you be asking yourself how you&rsquo;re going to pay for the house after the maximum payment kicks in?  These are the sort of things grown ups are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Now I do favor the idea of blacks dispersing among whites so long as they are liberal white academics.  Once a sufficient level of diversity is achieved we&rsquo;ll have a whole new roster of potential speakers at Amren conferences.<br>

		<p>Always the same old story.Blacks are always painted as helpless, innocent, meek victims who have been dealt an injustice by horrible exploiters and predators.<br>
 In fact, before the sub-prime disaster, the stage-villains were the &#8216;red-liners&rsquo; - who were liberally hated and abused.The &#8216;red-liners&rsquo; (where are these mythological beasts now?), oppressed black victims by not giving them mortgages under any circumstances.</p>

		<p>Thirty years ago, if you went into your local bank to get a home equity loan for the &#8220;trip of a lifetime&#8221;, the banker would have thrown you out on your rear end. I guess the easy money was too much of a temptation for a group of people who generally cannot plan more than a couple of days ahead. You could take both a black and a white couple making each 85K with a 200K home and 99 times out of 100, the white couple will have more wealth. Mr. &amp; Mrs. White will own a used Honda and a minivan. Mr. &amp; Mrs Black will have 2 new SUV&rsquo;s. Mrs. White will not get her hair and nails done weekly. Mr. and Mrs. White will not have a liquor cabinet full of Crown Royal and other top shelf liquors. Mrs. Black will complain at work to Mrs. White that she never has any money, then talk about going out for lunch, while Mrs. White eats her lunch in the break room or at her cubicle. </p>
<p>Not that I want to see blacks spread out all over, because it would be more of a disaster to have a few in every community than to have a concentration of the Non-talented 10th. </p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, many of us couldn&rsquo;t see well enough to carefully read those fliers posted on utility poles advertising no-interest subprime mortgage loans. Black neighborhoods throughout the country were targeted like crazy, as Massey and Rugh note, with billboards, robocalls, door-to-door cold calls, handbills under the windshield wipers and more.</p>
<p>But somehow we missed the &ldquo;fine print&rdquo; on those balloon-loan papers-the itty-bitty type that said: gotcha, sucker. If you already have spectacles, invest in a magnifying glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>My previous neighborhood was one where there were a lot of elderly people who had been there since the 1960&rsquo;s. Not a great market for home equity loans through fly by night companies. <br>
Granted, I never got the door to door cold calls, but I got a few phone calls with the guy telling me that &#8220;I needed to get my home equity working for me&#8221;. I responded that my house was not a piggy bank and quickly hung up. As far back as 2003, I knew that this housing bubble would eventually pop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prince George&rsquo;s, where I live, is the wealthiest predominately black county in the country and is reeling from the highest foreclosure rate in the state &mdash; and one of the highest in the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the best example that I can find of affirmative action on steroids. Many of the people who live there have iron-clad job security through Uncle Sam. Can we all guess where the problem lies?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way.  Wherever a single black is planted soon becomes a black enclave, attracting more and more blacks to the neighborhood at an accelerating rate.  Within a few years, a full-blown ghetto has begun, and the Whites start moving out.  Think of it as the first germs that rapidly grow into a fatal infection.</p>

		<p>I swear, the idiocy of the average journalist is truly breathtaking. Black neighborhoods have high default rates on loans for two reasons:<br>
1. Black people in general have a greater tendency than whites to simply walk away from debts.<br>
2. Black neighborhoods are more likely to have depressed property values, giving the homeowners extra incentive to walk away from loans, because nobody wants to live around black people, including other black people. This isn&rsquo;t going to change because of black people &#8220;spreading out&#8221;.</p>
<p>If black people follow Milloy&rsquo;s advice, it will simply lead to more white neighborhoods being ruined, and in twenty years time the likes of Milloy will be blaming &#8220;predatory lending&#8221; and, of course, &#8220;racism&#8221; for the sad state of these neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;But somehow we missed the &#8216;fine print&rsquo; on those balloon-loan papers-the itty-bitty type that said: gotcha, sucker. If you already have spectacles, invest in a magnifying glass.&#8221;<br>
Considering that all the banks got out of the deal were foreclosed properties (many of which were probably trashed by the owners) in undesirable neighborhoods, while the takers of the loans simply walked away and rented a place somewhere else, I&rsquo;m not really sure who the &#8220;sucker&#8221; is. On the other hand, if for some bizarre reason banks were trying to get foreclosed properties in black neighborhoods, maybe blacks should, I don&rsquo;t know, read loan agreements before signing them? I know, I know, it&rsquo;s one of those crazy white guy ideas, but I really think they might benefit from following such a rule.</p>

<p>Studies of Section 8 housing have proved the exact opposite. Low class blacks cut through an area. You can track crime increases to almost the exact number of new Section 8 residences are in an area. Even a few color-blind liberals are willing to admit this.  </p>

<p>You are kidding aren&rsquo;t you? tT use the terms &#8220;black&#8221; and&#8221;WISE UP&#8221; in the same sentence?  Please. How many years has it been since blacks have had everything,and every opportunity handed to them on a silver platter? Instead they only seem to squander the opportunities and bite the hand that feeds them. They have not as a whole, used the advantages given them (by the White race) to educate themselves and become an inspiring race and not a self destructive force among themselves as a people. They do what they do because of the lack of education, integrity, and self values. IT is what it is, they are who they are.</p>

		<p>Douglas Massey long has been a multicultural hack.  Back in 1993, he co-authored (with Nancy Denton) a book called &#8220;American Apartheid:  Segregation and the Making of the Underclass,&#8221; calling for thorough racial integration of all U.S. metropolitan areas, by any legal means necessary.  Injustice, as he sees it, solely attaches to whites.  Black behavior, criminal or otherwise, apparently has nothing to do with &#8220;white flight.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Sounds like someone is advocating a communist style &#8220;resettlement&#8221; program.  Of course, it&rsquo;s already been tried through school busing and also real estate law, etc., and always failed, partly because when a black shows up in a white neighborhood, bringing with him all those endearing traits we are so familiar with, whites move away.  But before they do, our single black (family) has already spread the word that this new place ain&rsquo;t bad at all, with lots of whites folks pandering to them.  A few years later they are all together again in a new location.</p>

		<p>The didn&rsquo;t lose money on a foreclose, the banks lose money on the foreclosure.  When you buy a house you can&rsquo;t afford and the house value  drops the bank (or government) ultimately gets the bill.</p>
<p>Predatory lending?  more like forced lending as banks were initially reluctant to loan money in certain neighborhoods because of the high default rate.  In steps the government and enourages the banks to lend in these certain neighborhoods.  The result: a huge banking mess and massive government debt. </p>
<p>Now they propose to scatter blacks among white neighborhoods?  That has been tried for forty years.  The result: whites move and create new neighborhoods and the old neighborhoods decay and collapse.  This is the same old stuff presented as something new. </p>

		<p>They won&rsquo;t be able to do bloc voting if they scatter.  I lived in Boston and saw that they owned the politicians there, and made sure to get very generous welfare and free housing.</p>
<p>However, if there weren&rsquo;t so many of them clustered in Boston, maybe it would be affordable for middle class Whites to live there again.  We had to leave as soon as we finished our schooling because it was too expensive for Whites to live there.  The Blacks and Hispanics lived there for FREE.</p>

		<p>If I remember right it was the Democrats that encouraged people to buy homes they couldn&rsquo;t afford. And if lenders did not loan to unqualified Blacks, they would be charged with civil rights violations. Instead of buying a modest $80,000 homes that they could make payments on, they went out and bought $250,000 homes they couldn&rsquo;t afford, just because the money was there. It should be obvious why Blacks are losing their homes. </p>

		<p> I could care less what&rsquo;s &#8220;best&#8221; for blacks. I do however care about what&rsquo;s best for Whites and living amongst blacks is definitely not best for our people. </p>
<p>White owned banks are now deemed &#8220;racist when they did make loans to minorities who could not afford the loan and they were &#8220;racists&#8221; if they refused to loan the money to minorities who had no business getting loans.</p>
<p>Either way, the failures of the minority community inevitably find their way back to the &#8220;racist&#8221; Whites in this country.<br>

		<p>Perhaps these troubled blacks should be given vouchers to live in and only in the neighborhoods where liberal democratic politicians live (where they surely would be welcomed?). Their children can mix with the liberal politician&rsquo;s children and go to the same schools. Surly the bleeding heart powers that be would like this set up.</p>

		<p>I can see where home ownership is the American Dream, but the emphasis should be on affordable home ownership.  Jack Kemp had the perfect idea for poor people in 1994, inspired by what Margaret Thatcher did in England.  That was to privatize public housing.</p>
<p>An old project was fixed up and set aside for people to buy in at very low-cost mortgage rates.  They themselves became responsible for upkeep and maintenance.  </p>
<p>My understanding was that, like Thatcher&rsquo;s program, it did precisely what it was designed to do.  Even though the buildings and the upgrades were identical before they became occupied by residents, there was a clear line of demarcation between the private projects and the public projects.  The private projects were clean, well-maintained, and safe (because the residents were extra wary about protecting their stuff).  The public projects looked terrible.  </p>
<p>Most of all, they had all the comforts of living around friends and people they knew and trusted in their old community and didn&rsquo;t have to go through the inconvenience of moving to some strange neighborhood where they felt alienated.  </p>
<p>The idea of giving inflatable mortgages to poor people on homes they could never afford anyway was stupid and destructive both for these people and the neighborhoods they moved in to.  IMO, this was nothing more than the government trying to move Non-Whites into White neighborhoods where they erected strict bars to the construction of low-income housing and apartments through zoning.  </p>
<p>In the interests of integration, miscegenation and destroying diversity through diversity, multiculturalism will destroy two or three communities rather than simply improving the one that needs the most help.<br>
