          <span class="dropcap">I</span>n the competition for which 
country is most afraid of the truth about race, Canada is surely at or 
near the top. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, I was recently treated to a wall 
of closed-mindedness that would be comic were it not for what it says 
about the cowed state of Canadian whites. In the end, AR stirred up a 
lot of media, but mainly because of a particularly disgraceful kind of 
closed-mindedness that not even self-righteous Canadian newspapers could
 ignore.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Canada tour began when Brian Boothe, an independent booking
 agent, set up a debate between me and Prof. David Divine, head of the 
Black Canadian Studies department (yes, they have such a thing) at 
Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Mr. Boothe appears to be 
an anti-racist, but must enjoy a fight; he arranged for me and Prof. 
Divine to debate the subject: &#8220;Racial Diversity: North America&rsquo;s 
Strength or Weakness?&#8221; The day was set for Jan. 15, 2007   &mdash;   the Martin 
Luther King, Jr. holiday, on which almost as many Canadians as Americans
 at least pretend to bow the knee to multi-racialism.

          I had not been to Canada in years, and was looking forward to 
the trip. Dalhousie University had printed up an attractive poster, I 
had bought my air tickets and made hotel reservations, but on Dec. 20, 
Mr. Boothe warned me there was trouble. He was right: According to a 
later press account, on that day, President Tom Traves of Dalhousie 
University got a message from something called the Atlantic Jewish 
Council. Whatever the message said, Mr. Traves immediately suggested to 
Prof. Divine it would be &#8220;odd&#8221; to hold the debate. As he later 
explained, &#8220;When a university feels that, essentially, it is being taken
 advantage of by someone who just wishes to use the credibility of the 
institution to advance a noxious cause, obviously it&rsquo;s our duty to 
preserve our institutional integrity.&#8221; Translation: &#8220;We don&rsquo;t like Jared
 Taylor&rsquo;s views, we can&rsquo;t refute them, so we won&rsquo;t debate.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          On Dec. 21, the university issued a statement saying it 
&#8220;learned more about the background and standpoint of the others involved
 in the proposed debate and has concluded a debate with people who held 
such views would not be a useful way to explore the topic [of racial 
diversity].&#8221; Mr. Boothe assured me he had forwarded a generous selection
 of material about me to Prof. Divine and, anyway, a ten-year-old with a
 computer can learn a lot about me in 15 minutes. I asked Prof. Divine 
by e-mail what was going on, and got a classic   &mdash;   of, well, something   &mdash;   
in reply (see &#8220;Mush From Divine,&#8221; below).
        </p>
        <table class="boxright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2007/03/08-NewspaperAd.jpg" alt="rejected Taylor ad" height="318" width="220" /> </td>

        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          Prof. Divine did not actually cancel the event. The date and 
place were already set and weren&rsquo;t to be wasted, after all, so he simply
 pitched me off the program and turned it into a monologue. He 
reportedly said he would be kind enough to summarize my views before 
refuting them. It was quick work to turn the original &#8220;debate&#8221; poster 
into one for a &#8220;lecture&#8221; on diversity in which no diversity of views was
 to be allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The press found this of some interest, and correctly reported 
my view that I thought Prof. Divine had backed down because he was 
afraid he would lose the debate. He piously claimed he could not be seen
 as permitting me to &#8220;espouse hate.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought this unmanly behavior deserved a comeuppance, so I 
decided to go to Halifax anyway, attend Prof. Divine&rsquo;s lecture, ask a 
few questions during the Q &amp; A period, and give my reply in a hotel 
ballroom the following evening, Jan. 16. I sent Prof. Divine an e-mail 
message explaining my plans and urging him to return to the original 
debate program. Failing that, I invited him to appear with me at the 
hotel, where we could have a proper exchange. He never replied.
        </p>
        <p>
          We booked a hall at Halifax&rsquo;s oldest hotel, the Lord Nelson, 
and made both print and radio ads for my Jan. 16 talk. Enthusiastic 
advertising people at the Halifax <cite>Chronicle-Herald</cite> accepted
 payment for an ad but then must have had an unpleasant talk with higher
 authority. They returned the money without explanation. The Halifax <cite>Daily News</cite>
 turned down the same ad. The sales staff at the local news radio 
station were also eager to take our money, but they, too, must have had a
 disagreeable chat with management. Merely to advertise a talk doubting 
the advantages of racial diversity appears to have been too much for the
 media barons of Halifax.

              <p>
                Dear Mr. Taylor,
              </p>
              <p>
                I am disappointed too that the debate had to be cancelled.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the Dalhousie University statement outlines, it was 
felt after further reflection and recent coverage of the issues, that 
the debate as envisaged which was designed to contribute to a dialogue, a
 conversation, with the prospect of enhancing open discussion and 
potential for change of opinions and attitudes, would be unlikely to 
meet that goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead there was a real possibility of major offence 
being occasioned which i am sure you or i would not wish to 
unintentionally be part of. Neither you or i have any control over how 
individuals or organisations wish to interpret our words and deeds, but i
 have a duty as far as i am able, to diminish the potential of such 
parties to take advantage of genuine efforts to enhance understanding of
 the challenges and opportunities in working with racial diversity, to 
promote intolerance and hate.
              </p>
              <p>
                I apologise for any inconvenience caused by the cancellation of your participation in this event.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sincerely yours,

          This meant that although I had told the press about my plans, 
there was no way to tell the public. My only opportunity was to attend 
Prof. Divine&rsquo;s lecture and announce to his audience I would be offering a
 reply the next evening. I designed a flyer, printed it off at the 
Halifax Kinkos, and prepared to disconcert Prof. Divine. He escaped me. 
There were a few inches of snow on the afternoon of the 15th, and the 
champion of diversity celebrated Martin Luther King&rsquo;s birthday by 
calling off his talk. I telephoned the Dalhousie switchboard to ask if 
the snow had affected any of the campus&rsquo;s evening events. &#8220;Only a 
lecture by Prof. Divine on diversity,&#8221; the operator told me cheerfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dalhousie did not put a cancellation notice on its web page, 
so I decided to go to the lecture hall and hand out leaflets to whoever 
might show up   &mdash;   there was a total of three people. There seems not to 
have been much appetite for a monologue on diversity. I put up the rest 
of my flyers in the Student Union, and switched the reservation at the 
Lord Nelson to a smaller room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night of the 16th, I had an audience of perhaps a 
half-dozen people, with about twice as many journalists. A few minutes 
before I was to be introduced, about two dozen scruffy youngsters   &mdash;   male
 and female, all apparently white   &mdash;   filed into the room and took seats. 
Perhaps a third had kerchiefs over their faces likes Wild-West bandits.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thug went to the literature table and took my sample 
copies of AR. I followed him to his seat and took them back. Then a 
woman began beating pans together, while the rest chanted like lobotomy 
victims: &#8220;Jared Taylor, racist scum, let&rsquo;s put fascists on the run!&#8221; 
During the lulls, people shouted elegant, witty things like &#8220;Do us a 
favor and put a bullet in your head, you f**kng Nazi.&#8221; Hotel security 
was quickly attracted by the din, and I signaled to them to call the 
police, which they said they would. I mocked the louts for their gutter 
language, and urged them to shout louder   &mdash;   I wasn&rsquo;t getting the message,
 I told them. I let them wail and chant, expecting the police to arrive,
 restore order, and let me give my talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          After perhaps five minutes, half a dozen of the men   &mdash;   boys, 
really   &mdash;   came to the front of the room and surrounded me. Others went 
over to the literature table and started tearing issues of AR to pieces 
and throwing them around the room and at me. Then the boys who had 
surrounded me linked arms and made a human wall, forcing me to the door.

          While the shouting had been going on, I felt sorry for this 
band of losers, so pathetically afraid they would lose an argument that 
they had to prevent me from speaking. When they started pushing me 
around physically, I felt like killing them, but restrained myself. If 
there had been any damage I would probably have been blamed, not my 
assailants.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the human wall got me to the door, one of the boys put me
 in a bear-hug and pushed me into the hall. He didn&rsquo;t then seem to know 
what to do. A tall man walked up, laid hold of him, and told him to let 
go. I thought for a moment I had a friend in the audience, but the man 
later told a reporter he was from the Atlantic Jewish Council and was 
there only to see if I said anything about Jews. From what he said to 
the bear-hugger, I gathered he wanted to stop any further loutishness 
because it reflected badly on the anti-racists.

        <p>
          At about that time, hotel security decided to clear the room, and that was the end of the lecture. The <i>banditos</i>
 left, unmolested by the police, who were reportedly somewhere on the 
premises. The louts had brought flyers of their own   &mdash;   photographs of me 
with the words &#8220;Racist Scum&#8221; in big letters. I offered to autograph 
them, and got one taker. I gave several short interviews to the 
reporters who were still there, and then returned to my room. I e-mailed
 to the print journalists copies of the talk I had been unable to 
deliver, and waited to watch the late television news. What appeared was
 a good, factual account, with footage of screaming protestors, leading 
up to my being muscled out of the room. There were also several good 
excerpts from my later remarks to the press. What I did not hear on the 
air was the question I had been asking the journalists all night: &#8220;If my
 views are wrong or even loathsome, they should be easy to refute. Why 
isn&rsquo;t Prof. Divine or someone else jumping at the chance to prove me 
wrong?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          I had reservations to leave Halifax early the next morning, so
 I went down to the police station late that night and wrote out a 
lengthy complaint against the people who had disturbed the peace, 
destroyed my property, and assaulted me. The radio was on at the police 
station, and as I was leaving, a report came on about the events at the 
Lord Nelson. &#8220;That&rsquo;s the assault I&rsquo;m talking about,&#8221; I said. The police 
just looked bored.

          The next day, back in Virginia, I was in great demand from the
 Halifax media. I gave an interview at the Washington bureau of Canadian
 TV, which reported fairly and accurately. The papers and radio station 
that had refused ads for my talk had perhaps tumbled to the thought that
 the effect of their refusal was no different from that of the thugs 
they were now denouncing: to squelch unpopular speech. My views were 
&#8220;clearly repugnant,&#8221; huffed the <cite>Chronicle-Herald</cite> (funny   &mdash;   
they hadn&rsquo;t heard them), but &#8220;mobs have no legitimacy as arbiters of 
permissible speech.&#8221; One columnist looked over the copy of the refused 
ads and wondered why they had been rejected, noting that they &#8220;didn&rsquo;t 
seem incendiary.&#8221; Some of the less hopped-up anti-racists grumped that 
the louts had drawn more attention to my talk than it would have gotten 
without them.
        </p>
        <table class="boxcenter">

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          And how about the brave and noble Prof. Divine? He told Canada
 Television he thought I had been hoping for a mob to break up the talk 
so as to get more attention. He also told one newsman the louts were 
right to shout me down, that there is a difference between free speech 
and irresponsible speech, and that I had crossed the line. I told the 
reporter that if Prof. Divine said that, he was not fit to be a 
university professor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, the people who were afraid to defend their 
views were making excuses. Karen Mock, former executive director of the 
Canadian Race Relations Foundation, explained to a duly credulous 
reporter for the Canadian <cite>National Post</cite> that to propose a 
debate is &#8220;an old Klan trick.&#8221; &#8220;They [people like me] can&rsquo;t be refuted 
because their lies are propaganda and the arguments are circular and 
conspiratorial,&#8221; she added helpfully. Dr. Mock went on to explain that 
racism can be discussed, but not with &#8220;racists.&#8221; Canada seems to be full
 of people who think they should decide who gets to speak and who 
doesn&rsquo;t.

        <p>
          How is the police investigation coming along? The press 
photographers were snapping away and the TV cameras were whirring while 
the mob destroyed my property and assaulted me, so these must have been 
some of the best photographed crimes in Halifax history. The detective 
assigned to my case is going through the legal process of securing the 
photographic evidence. He knows the media have their eye on this case, 
and he wants to have everything in order before he makes arrests. In the
 meantime, members of the web site Stormfront.org have monitored lefties
 bragging on the Internet about how they shut down a talk by &#8220;racist 
scum,&#8221; and have positively identified even some of the louts who wore 
bandannas. When the police make their move, they will have a mountain of
 evidence.
        </p>
          Three weeks after the debate that never happened, I am still 
trying to organize a civilized exchange of views. A philosophy professor
 at another university in Halifax is willing to step into the ring, and 
we are looking for an appropriate venue. This time, given the extended 
publicity the non-debate received, I expect to draw a crowd   &mdash;   and a 
rather better-behaved one. In the meantime, we have received a great 
many inquiries from Canada, and subscriptions are rolling in. The 
authorities are, if anything, even more closed-minded in Canada than in 
the United States, but the people still see things clearly.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" />

						<blockquote> <i>Last November, Prof. David Divine of Dalhousie 
University in Halifax, Canada, agreed to meet Jared Taylor in a debate 
on whether racial diversity is a strength or a weakness. Late in 
December, he backed out of his agreement, claiming he had been unaware 
of Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s background, and was now unwilling to let him speak. AR 
secured a venue in Halifax, where Jared Taylor planned to give the 
following talk on Jan. 16, the day after Prof. Divine gave his.</i> </blockquote>
        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">G</span>ood evening, ladies and 
gentlemen. As I believe you all know, this meeting became necessary 
after Professor David Divine of Dalhousie University backed out of an 
agreement to have a public debate with me on the question: &#8220;Racial 
Diversity: North America&rsquo;s Strength or Weakness.&#8221; On December 21, he 
announced that after looking into my background, he decided to turn the 
debate into a monologue, in other words, to have a discussion about 
diversity in which diversity of opinions was not allowed. The place and 
time had been set. The university had even designed a spiffy poster 
advertising the debate. But no, a debate with me &#8220;would not be a useful 
way to explore the topic.&#8221;

          Prof. Divine said that as part of his monologue he would be 
kind enough to summarize my views for the audience   &mdash;   and then explain 
why they are wrong. How he proposed to summarize my views without 
hearing them is a mystery to me, but that makes his job a bit easier, 
doesn&rsquo;t it? Rather than face a real opponent, he wanted to set up a 
straw man to knock down.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contacted him early this month to tell him I was coming to 
Halifax anyway. I urged him to stick to his agreement and debate me. I 
pointed out that if my ideas are wrong he should have no trouble 
refuting them. He refused to meet me. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe 
Prof. Divine is a coward. I think he is afraid to face a serious 
opponent in a serious debate on the subject of what amounts to the state
 religion of Canada: the assertion that multiculturalism and racial 
diversity are great strengths for a country.

          And I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that an assertion   &mdash;  
 a belief   &mdash;   is all it is. How, exactly, is racial diversity a strength 
for Canada or any other country? Does it raise per capita GNP? Does it 
improve crop yields? Does it lower crime rates? Does it reduce green 
house gasses? Does it lower taxes?
        </p>
        <p>
          No, it doesn&rsquo;t do any of those things. I&rsquo;m not sure I have 
ever heard its boosters say specifically what it does. I will tell you 
what racial diversity does: It results in conflict, tension, and 
hostility. At its worst, racial diversity can lead to race riots, 
racially-motivated murder and assault. At its <em>best,</em> when 
communities of different races try to live together they simply leave 
each other alone. The result is relatively peaceful voluntary 
segregation. Except for a few bohemians, people of different races do 
not often mingle naturally and happily.

          Think honestly about your own lives. How racially diverse are 
your dinner parties, your ski outings, your church services, your 
backyard barbecues? If racial diversity were a strength, people would be
 drawn to it naturally. They would mix spontaneously with people unlike 
themselves. And yet, they do not. They do not because racial diversity 
is not a strength. It is a source of tension and conflict. People may 
submit to racial diversity in their public lives but turn their backs on
 it in their private lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, you probably think that every major Canadian institution 
from the federal government on down takes the view that racial diversity
 is a great strength for Canada. In fact, they all agree with me. They 
all assert most emphatically that racial diversity is not a source of 
strength but a source of conflict. The only difference is that instead 
of the word &#8220;conflict,&#8221; they use the word &#8220;racism.&#8221; Whatever &#8220;racism&#8221; 
may be, they all agree that it is a very bad thing, and that Canadian 
society is riddled with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if there were no racial diversity in Canada, there could 
be no racial discrimination, could there? So please remember this: 
Whenever people complain about racism, bigotry, hatred, racial 
profiling, discrimination, they are not talking about the joys and 
benefits of racial diversity. They are admitting that it is a source of 
tension and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          To repeat, your government and institutions agree with me, not
 with Prof. Divine. That is why every province and territory has two 
major bureaucracies that fight racism: a Human Rights Commission and a 
Human Rights Tribunal. Then there is the federal Human Rights Commission
   &mdash;   200 people work for it full-time   &mdash;   the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation, the National Anti-Racism Council of Canada, and dozens more 
city and local bureaucracies fighting racism. Every university has an 
office for fighting racism.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that&rsquo;s not enough. The Canadian UNESCO Commission wants to
 establish a Canadian Coalition of Municipalities Against Racism. Saint 
Paul University in Ottawa wants what it calls a National Justice 
Initiative Against Racism and Hate. In 2005, the federal government 
launched Canada&rsquo;s Action Plan Against Racism, which was to spend $56 
million over the next five years combating racism. You have 
Parliamentary Committees on Visible Minorities and Standing Committees 
on Multiculturalism. It&rsquo;s hard to keep up with all the bureaucrats whose
 job it is to sniff out racism and eradicate it. None of this would be 
necessary were there no racial diversity in Canada.

          How bad is the race problem? The Ontario Human Rights 
Commission says &#8220;Racial discrimination and racism&#8221; are &#8220;pervasive and 
continuing.&#8221; The Canadian Race Relations Foundation says &#8220;racism is 
serious and pervasive.&#8221; The Canadian Commission for UNESCO says racism 
&#8220;imperils democracy.&#8221; The federal Human Rights Commission says &#8220;hate 
and, in particular, its manifestation on the Internet pose a serious 
threat to the social fabric of Canadian society.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          How can racial diversity be a strength if it gives rise to 
something that &#8220;imperils democracy&#8221; that &#8220;poses a serious threat to the 
social fabric of Canadian society?&#8221; This question deserves an answer, 
ladies and gentlemen, but because Prof. Divine is afraid to debate me, 
I&rsquo;m afraid it will not get one. In fact, I suspect Prof. Divine is 
afraid to debate me because he knows this question has no answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s go back to Ontario, where there is the most racial 
diversity in Canada, and where we should therefore find the most 
strength. Try a search on the web site for the government of Ontario on 
the word &#8220;racism&#8221; and see how many hits you get. I got 4,852 when I 
tried it in December. And I didn&rsquo;t even try &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; &#8220;bigotry,&#8221;
 or &#8220;hatred,&#8221; or any number of other promising terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ontario Human Rights Commission hears 700 to 800 racial 
discrimination cases every year. Each case takes an average of a little 
over a year to finish, and the commission is so overworked it has a 
backlog, despite its $13 million annual budget and staff of 130. And 
remember: Although the Ontario commission may be the busiest, every 
province and territory has one, and there is one for the federal 
government, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right here in Nova Scotia, the Human Rights Commission 
sponsors a forum every year that &#8220;examines the challenges being faced by
 different racial groups in maintaining and defining their identities in
 an increasingly complex world.&#8221; It also sponsors a series of breakfasts
 called &#8220;Champions of the Workplace,&#8221; where employers &#8220;discuss successes
 and challenges related to managing inclusion within their workforces.&#8221; 
If diversity is such a strength I wonder why it has to be &#8220;managed,&#8221; why
 there are &#8220;challenges,&#8221; and why it takes &#8220;champions of the workplace&#8221; 
to make it work. The Nova Scotia commission also offers &#8220;workshops on 
issues surrounding diversity, discrimination, race relations, and 
harassment.&#8221; Why does something that is a great strength require 
workshops?
        </p>
        <p>
          In Nova Scotia you have an entire ministry devoted to blacks   &mdash;  
 whom it calls African-Nova Scotians. Why do you need that ministry if 
racial diversity is a strength?

          The city of Halifax itself is abuzz with worries about racism.
 Just search the Dalhousie University web site for &#8220;racism&#8221; and you will

special graduation ceremony for black students. It issues a bi-weekly

Inspiring, Empowering,&#8221; and each issue starts with an African proverb. 
&#8220;Stop profiling our young Black brothers as being drug dealers and pimps

          Survival guide? Why is all this special hand-holding necessary if racial diversity is a strength?
        </p>
        <p>
          The city of Halifax recently had a classic demonstration of 
the disadvantages of racial diversity. The local paper, the <cite>Chronicle Herald,</cite>
 reports that Education Minister Karen Casey just fired the entire 
Halifax School Board. Why? According to the paper&rsquo;s Dec. 20th issue, 
&#8220;Ms. Casey&rsquo;s decision came after a recent shouting match among about a 
half-dozen members that involved accusations of racism. &#8216;Collectively, 
they are not able to work together in the best interest of students,&rsquo; 
she said.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          So it appears that racism is a very considerable scourge in 
Canada, but it is reassuring to know that commissions and tribunals and 
study groups and associations and foundations are beavering away night 
and day fighting it. They&rsquo;ll soon have it under control, right? Well, 
maybe not. A recent survey by Statistics Canada found that, nearly 50 
percent of blacks say they have suffered from discrimination or unfair 
treatment, as have 33 percent of South Asians and Chinese. (No report by
 StatCan on whether any whites suffer from racism.) A 2003 report on 
immigrants living in West Central Toronto found that 68 percent had 
suffered just from housing discrimination, let alone any other kind of 
discrimination.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004 the Dominion Institute did a big poll and found that 
65 percent of Canadians said that over the past five years there has 
been no change in the level of racism in their communities. Thirteen 
percent said racism had decreased but 17 percent said there was more of 
it than five years ago. Is Canada losing the fight against racism? That 
would seem to be the message of this survey, which was, ironically 
enough, taken to mark International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination.

          And then there is the report York University wrote for the 
city of Toronto in 2000 about race, housing, and poverty. &#8220;There are 
huge levels of inequality,&#8221; explained the author Michael Ornstein, &#8220;and 
they are very strongly correlated with ethnoracial characteristics.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Carol Tator, a Toronto-based academic seems to think you are 
losing the fight, too. The Dec. 24 issue of your local paper, the <cite>Chronicle Herald,</cite>
 quotes her as saying, &#8220;The problem of racial profiling in Canada both 
historically and currently is a national crisis across this country.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          And it is not as though the fight against racism only just got
 started. You have been battling it longer than we have in America. The 
first modern anti-racist legislation in Canada was Ontario&rsquo;s Racial 
Discrimination Act of 1944. We didn&rsquo;t have anything like that at the 
state or federal level in 1944. Ontario banned racial discrimination in 
employment in 1951, and by 1960 every province had passed similar bans. 
We didn&rsquo;t get a national ban until 1964. You have comprehensive 
anti-racism legislation at provincial and federal levels   &mdash;   you&rsquo;ve had it
 for decades. You even have a Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and Canadian Identity, part of whose job is to fight discrimination. And
 yet the battle still rages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us accept, for a moment, the lefty view of all this, 
namely that racism   &mdash;   whatever that may be   &mdash;   is a moral failing that 
afflicts only whites. Non-whites   &mdash;   every man, woman and child   &mdash;   are 
noble, unoffending sufferers, whose sole aim is to be accepted as the 
loyal Canadians they are. Parenthetically, this seems to be the view of 
all your human rights commissions, too, but no matter. If this view is 
correct, it means whites are a uniquely defective people who break out 
in helpless spasms of racism whenever they encounter non-whites.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if that is true, why must whites   &mdash;   and their non-white 
victims   &mdash;   be put through the ordeal of racial diversity? If, after 
decades of combating racism whites are still hopelessly racist, what is 
gained by an immigration policy that brings in yet more non-whites only 
to make them suffer at the hands of whites, and that degrades whites by 
bringing out the worst in them? Toronto used to be virtually all-white. 
There couldn&rsquo;t have been much racial discrimination. Now, all official 
sources agree that Toronto is a hive of racial discrimination. How has 
racial diversity therefore been a strength for Toronto or for Canada?
        </p>
        <p>
          This, therefore, is one problem with racial diversity. The 
races don&rsquo;t seem to get along very well. Just look at all this agonizing
 and hand-wringing over racism. You may choose to blame all the problems
 exclusively on wicked white people, but why pretend racial diversity is
 a strength?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a second aspect of racial diversity on which Canada 
is strangely silent. Have the non-whites who are coming and who are 
increasing racial diversity improved the country? I realize this is a 
taboo question, but let us ask it anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the unpleasant consequences of racial diversity is that
 whites, at any rate, have to be very careful about how they talk. In 
2005 the chief economist of CIBC World Markets Jeff Rubin was spanked 
and sent for sensitivity training when he wrote that oil prices would 
double by 2010 because &#8220;this time around there won&rsquo;t be any tap that 
some appeased mullah or sheik can suddenly turn back on.&#8221; Writing about 
&#8220;sheiks&#8221; apparently upset the Islamic lobby.
        </p>

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          But I think the &#8220;Kemosabe&#8221; case was more interesting. As you 
will recall, that is what Tonto called the Lone Ranger in the TV series.
 Well, right here in Nova Scotia, your Human Rights Commission worked 
itself into a lather when a Mi&rsquo;kmaq lady named Dorothy Moore said her 
boss called her Kemosabe. He called everyone Kemosabe, but she took 
offense. The commission appointed a board of inquiry to look into the 
complaint. It watched a bunch of Lone Ranger reruns and concluded in 
February 2004, that first, Kemosabe is not an insult, and that Ms. Moore
 hadn&rsquo;t clearly shown she was offended by being called Kemosabe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission was determined that 
&#8220;Kemosabe&#8221; be found racist and demeaning. It appealed the board of 
inquiry&rsquo;s decision to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. The court agreed 
with the board, namely that Miss Moore hadn&rsquo;t proven the word was an 
insult, but the human rights commission still would not give up. It took
 the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada! The Supreme Court 
had better things to do than watch reruns of &#8220;The Lone Ranger,&#8221; and 
refused to take the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;We&rsquo;re disappointed,&#8221; said Mayann Francis, head of the Nova 
Scotia Human Rights Commission. &#8220;We thought this case might help 
establish clearer guidelines for dealing with discrimination and the 
cultural differences one finds in a diverse workplace.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ladies and gentlemen. If this is the sort of thing you get from a &#8220;diverse workplace&#8221; who needs it?
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court did, however, take up the question of 
whether Sikh students can wear ceremonial daggers to school. The 
Montreal school board didn&rsquo;t want students running around with knives, 
but the Supreme Court said they could, as a matter of religious freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court does not yet appear to be involved, but back
 in 2005 your federal Justice Department helped fund a year-long, 
$150,000 study of polygamy. Last year it announced its recommendations. 
It said there are already so many polygamous Muslims in the country that
 Canada should get rid of its laws banning polygamy. Go with the flow. 
Make bigamy legal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do bigamists and kids with daggers make Canada a better place?
 Or are we even allowed to ask questions like that? Without diversity, 
these questions would not arise.

          Let&rsquo;s return for a moment to the subject of speaking freely. Let&rsquo;s talk abut white flight. There was a 2004 <cite>Toronto Star</cite>
 article about a new Statistics Canada report on the appearance of 
visible minority neighborhoods in Canada&rsquo;s big cities. Whites used to 
live in these places but they have moved out. According to the <cite>Toronto Star,</cite> StatCan could not bring itself to use the term &#8220;white flight,&#8221; and wrote only about &#8220;rapid replacement.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, someone apparently wasn&rsquo;t told about how we are now 
supposed to talk. That same year, 2004, Toronto city councilman from 
Scarborough Mike Del Grande told his local paper that &#8220;a lot of white 
people are moving out&#8221; of his ward. Another councilman immediately 
jumped on Mr. Del Grande: &#8220;To hear someone say white people are leaving 
and Chinese are coming in can be nothing other than a racist comment,&#8221; 
said Joe Mihevc. Poor Mr. Del Grande had to apologize: &#8220;I should have 
said many older residents of the community (are moving out),&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t say it in a politically correct way.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what is going on when a city councilman says something 
that is obviously true, is accused of racism, and is forced to say he 
should have spoken in code rather than speak clearly? You can&rsquo;t even 
describe what is going on before your very eyes, much less talk about 
why whites are leaving and whether they might even be justified in 
leaving. This doesn&rsquo;t sound like a strength to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vice principal of Queens University unbosomed what strikes
 me as a significant truth about Canada. Recently he was quoted as 
saying, &#8220;Our Canadian culture has been squeamish about gathering 
race-based statistics because no one wants to see ethnic makeup reduced 
to numbers on a page. But unless you get this kind of information, you 
don&rsquo;t really know if you have a problem.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, yes. How do you even begin to assess whether racial 
diversity is a strength or a weakness unless you gather the information.
 Do different groups have different rates of illegitimacy? School 
failure? Poverty? If they do, does it make sense to add to those groups 
through immigration? Take crime data. I understand Canada does not keep 
records of racial differences in crime rates. Too squeamish, I suppose. 
And yet everyone knows some groups commit more crime than others. Your 
newspapers talk about it indirectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is from the <cite>Canadian Press</cite> of December 24, 2005:
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Cities like Vancouver and Toronto have been rocked by a wave 
of gang violence in recent years. Almost 100 men in rival Indo-Canadian 
gangs in Vancouver have been murdered since 1994, often execution-style,
 over drug deals gone bad. Toronto&rsquo;s gang violence, on the other hand, 
often involving gun-wielding young black men, has escalated to the point
 that a coalition of African-Canadians recently called on Prime Minister
 Paul Martin to declare the issue a national crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Of the more than 70 murders in the Toronto area so far this 
year, a large portion of them have involved gang members   &mdash;   as many as 30
 in the black community and many others among Asian, Latino and Tamil 
gangs, said Tony Warr, Toronto&rsquo;s deputy police chief.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&rsquo;s the <cite>Globe and Mail</cite> of Oct. 17, 2005, 
telling us that on a per capita basis Winnipeg has become the murder 
capital of Canada. &#8220;Most of the victims of violent crime are 
aboriginals, Third World immigrants, gang members, homeless people or 
transients. Winnipeg&rsquo;s West End  &hellip; has long been in thrall to a gang known as the Mad Cowz, made up mostly of young African immigrants, many in their teens.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Vancouver paper <cite>The Province,</cite> issue of 
Oct. 21, 2005, we read, &#8220;A violent ethnic war between Filipino and 
Vietnamese youths in the Lower Mainland will likely escalate, Vancouver 
police said yesterday.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a March 16, 2006 story in the Calgary <cite>Sun,</cite> with the headline: &#8220;Feared Gang Hits Calgary.&#8221; A gang of white people? No. It is MS 13 from El Salvador.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2005, black violence got so bad in Toronto that one 
councilman, Michael Thompson, urged the police to pull over young blacks
 randomly and see if they were armed. Mr. Thompson said this wasn&rsquo;t 
racial profiling, but that &#8220;the police now have got to take measures   &mdash;   
drastic measures.&#8221; There was criticism of this, of course, but Mr. 
Thompson was not hounded out of polite society as you might suspect. He 
is black and thus enjoys the benefits of protective coloring.

          Now, as we saw, Canada is too squeamish to collect crime 
statistics by race, but the United States is not. We know, for example, 
that blacks commit robbery and murder at approximately eight to ten 
times the white rate, that Hispanics commit these crimes at three to 
four times the white rate. Hispanics are 19 times more likely than 
whites to be in youth gangs, and blacks are 18 times more likely. I 
would suspect there are equally striking racial differences in Canada, 
but no one knows because the government doesn&rsquo;t want to know.

        <p>
          We find yet another interesting diversity issue in the case of
 Toronto&rsquo;s now-defunct zero-tolerance policy on crimes in schools. 
Students were committing so much robbery, drug dealing, sexual assault, 
and weapons violations that in 2000 the province passed the Safe Schools
 Act, requiring that any student guilty of these offences be expelled or
 suspended. Just four years later the province had to drop the policy. 
Why? Non-whites were being expelled and suspended all out of proportion 
to their numbers. More than 1,000 children <em>under the age of seven</em>
 had been suspended   &mdash;   for things like robbery, weapons possession and 
drug dealing   &mdash;   and the majority were black. So Toronto had to junk the 
zero-tolerance policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This story illuminates two things: First, we learn that 
non-whites were the major source of the problem; you did not have a rash
 of crimes like this when the schools were overwhelmingly white. Second,
 a sensible, non-discriminatory solution had to be ditched because 
non-whites were getting more of their share of the punishment. Here, 
racial diversity both caused the problem and made it impossible to apply
 an obvious solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we&rsquo;re on the subject of Toronto schools, in 2005, a 
black school board member proposed setting up an all-black school. Lloyd
 McKell, who had the title of executive officer of student and community
 equity, said all-black schools might be a necessary way to fight high 
dropout and expulsion rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just last April right here in Halifax, a black educator named 
Wade Smith said integrated schools were doing such a poor job with 
blacks that he thought Halifax needs a school just for blacks. I thought
 segregation was supposed to be bad for blacks. Now, it turns out 
integration is bad for blacks. Racial diversity seems to be very tricky 
business, indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back to Toronto, in 2005, a coalition of 22 black community 
groups   &mdash;   but let&rsquo;s stop right there. A coalition of 22 black community 
groups? Twenty-two race based associations? What do they all do? Why are
 they needed? Why are they racially exclusive? How many more are there 
that are not part of this coalition? Are they all glorying in the 
strengths of racial diversity? Anyway, a <cite>Toronto Star</cite> 
article begins like this: &#8220;A Toronto coalition of 22 black community 
groups disgusted by gun murders in the city wants a separate set of 
rules and institutions for blacks   &mdash;   from a government department to a 
diversion program for minor crimes.&#8221;

        <p>
          The article then quotes Zanana Akande, a former principal and 
an Ontario cabinet minister in Bob Rae&rsquo;s NDP government. She says: 
&#8220;Blacks have now reached the point of such disgust, such frustration, 
such a feeling of rejection  &hellip; that 
well-trained, well-qualified, capable people have given up and said, 
&#8216;You know what? Maybe we should have our own [institutions]&rsquo;.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          The article continues: &#8220;Margaret Parsons, executive director 
of the African Canadian Legal Clinic went further, saying Canada&rsquo;s 
vaunted policy of multi-culturalism has blinded authorities to systemic 
racism against blacks, even as they adopt policies of inclusion and 
integration.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          The white man just can&rsquo;t get it right. Here he is, adopting 
policies of inclusion and integration, but they only blind him to 
systemic racism against blacks. And we are still supposed to believe 
racial diversity is a strength?
        </p>
        <p>
          Outright segregation makes white people nervous so, according to the <cite>Toronto Star</cite>
 of last July 19, blacks will have to settle for a new &#8220;Africentric&#8221; 
curriculum that is supposed to boost black pride and improve grades. 
There is even going to be Africentric math, with a unit on racial 
profiling. Does anyone think that will really improve grades?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, now you have a bit of a problem with Muslims, too. In a July 25, 2006 article from the Halifax <cite>Chronicle-Herald</cite>, we get another revealing headline: &#8220;Study: Conflict Likely Between Canada, Its Muslim Citizens.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          But maybe that shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising. Last summer police 
arrested a group of young Muslims   &mdash;   &#8220;homegrown terrorists&#8221; you have been
 calling them   &mdash;   who were going to storm the Canadian Parliament, hold 
politicians hostage, and maybe even behead the prime minister. According
 to the <cite>Globe and Mail</cite> of last June 29, the wives of the 
four main conspirators shared &#8220;among other things, their passion for 
holy war, disgust at virtually every aspect of non-Muslim society and a 
hatred of Canada.&#8221; Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Canadians don&rsquo;t 
care for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, so many of Toronto&rsquo;s Muslims were taking 
their children out of classes that were supposed to teach them the right
 attitude toward homosexuals that Ontario&rsquo;s prime minister got involved.
 In 2004, Dalton McGuinty issued a personal plea to Muslim parents to 
let their children take these classes. Diversity seems to be tricky for 
all sorts of reasons.

          So far, I haven&rsquo;t said anything about Canada&rsquo;s oldest 
experiment with racial diversity, which is relations between whites and 
aboriginals. If diversity is a strength, this one should be well 
developed because it has been around the longest. Somehow, it doesn&rsquo;t 
seem that way. It was news even in the United States when Indians took 
over the town of Caledonia, Ontario, which they claimed was on their 
land, and chased out the white man. <cite>McLeans</cite> magazine warns 
of more to come. An article from just last December 27 begins like this:
 &#8220;Canada should brace for more dramatic displays of aboriginal defiance 
in 2007, warn native leaders who say the First Nations frustrations that
 boiled over in a small Ontario town this year may well be a tipping 
point for decades of simmering aboriginal anger.&#8221; Decades of simmering 
aboriginal anger. It sounds like another source of strength gone bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the very day of the <i>McLeans</i> article, the <cite>Mohawk Nation News</cite>
 wrote: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t get any ideas that we will become Canadians. No way! We 
can and will handle our own affairs. So get out of our way while the 
going is good. Canada, you know, everything belongs to us. We&rsquo;re getting
 it all back.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are we to conclude from all this? Ladies and 
gentlemen, let us face facts squarely. Racial diversity in Canada, just 
as it is in America, is an ordeal. Sometimes, a difficult, agonizing 
ordeal. It is a source of resentment, guilt-mongering, and endless 
charges of racism.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it were a strength, non-white groups would not set up 
countless race-based organizations to protect and advance their 
interests. If it were a strength, no one would need diversity managers 
or sensitivity training. If it were a strength, Canadians would not 
naturally separate on racial lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look around the world. Wherever people are killing each
 other most diligently, they are killing each other because of 
diversity. The Tutsis and Hutus slaughtered each other because of ethnic
 differences. The Tamils and Sinhalese slaughter each other in Sri Lanka
 because of religious and ethnic differences. Arabs and blacks slaughter
 each other in Darfur because of racial and religious reasons. Arabs and
 Israelis slaughter each other because of ethnic and religious 
differences.

        <p>
          Diversity of the kind Canada is promoting is one of the most 
obviously divisive forces on the planet. To keep jabbering, as Canadians
 are supposed to do, that diversity is strength is like repeating the 
three official government slogans from George Orwell&rsquo;s <cite>1984.</cite> Let me remind you what they were:
        </p>
        <p>
          War is Peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freedom is Slavery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignorance is Strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Diversity is strength&#8221; fits right in, doesn&rsquo;t it?
        </p>
        <p>
          And to add to the Orwellian atmosphere, I must point out that 
Canada has laws against free speech that touch on this very subject. All
 I have done this evening is quote government sources and read newspaper
 articles, and yet several people warned me that for giving this talk I 
could be arrested for &#8220;inciting racial hatred.&#8221; Others said that as an 
American I could be turned away at the border for the same reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isn&rsquo;t this exactly what desperate, totalitarian regimes do? Promote lies and then punish people who speak the truth?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are living in dangerous times, ladies and gentlemen. If 
your government will lie to you about this, what will it lie about next?
 If it forbids dissent on this subject, what will it forbid next?
        </p>
        <p>
          With your immigration and multi-culturalist policies you are 
dicing with the future of your country. If there is even a small chance 
that by replacing European Canadians with Third-World Canadians you will
 end up with a Third-World country, do you not owe it to your children 
and grandchildren to think seriously about the demographic future of 
your country?
        </p>
          There are those who would prefer that you never think about 
this. That you remain ignorant of any dissenting argument about race. It
 was in order to keep you ignorant that I was shut out of yesterday&rsquo;s 
event. But as Orwell warned, just as freedom is not slavery, ignorance 
is not strength.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" />

		<p>So, the former executive director of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation wont even hear the arguments of whites, unless they too are calling for rights for people of color or properly condemning racial activists, when they are white. Then these same folks have major discussions on Institutional Racism and say that it is people of color who are being oppressed and excluded. </p>

		<p>This madness that Canada has become is a kick in the head to all the Canadians who still believe in Free Speech. How this so called &#8220;tolerance&#8221; can be so easily tolerated is shameful. Even if I didn&rsquo;t agree with Jared Taylor&rsquo;s views on the topics of race or any other topic I would still be in favor of cordially inviting him to state or debate his stance anywhere in our once fine country. Shame on you Canada.   </p>

		<p>Race is very real and recent genetic studies have confirmed this. The reason why most people have not heard about these scientific studies is because the politically correct Marxist main stream media do not give these studies any exposure. </p>
<p>Look at this scientific study.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4alme" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/y4alme</a></p>
<p>Look at the huge number of scientists and institutions that took part in this scientific study.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from the study above:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from FOUR POPULATIONS with ANCESTRY in EUROPE, AFRICA and ASIA (the HAPMAP collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number VARIABLE REGIONS (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12% OF THE GENOME) were identified in these populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>As can be seen there exists a 12% CNV difference between the races.<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>MODERN GENETICS have proved that we are all very much less alike than the Human genome project initially thought back in the year 2001. The HGP never even looked at COPY NUMBER VARIATIONS (CNV) because back then it did not even know that CNV&rsquo;s existed.</p>
<p>Here is an easy example.</p>
<p>If one man has a banana and another man has 10 bananas, then the HGP claimed that the bananas between them were 99.9% identical. This was the logic of the &#8220;human genome project&#8221;, when it concluded that all humans are 99.9% identical.</p>
<p>BUT one man has more bananas than the other.</p>
<p>This is a single &#8220;Copy number variation.&#8221; CNV</p>
<p>As you can see CNV differences are very important.</p>
<p>Now modern science tells us that 12% CNV exists between the races.</p>
<p>Here it is presented in graphical form.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4dj49ov" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/4dj49ov</a></p>
<p>Then look at this scientific study.</p>
<p>Go to the Hapmap here&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">https://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a></p>
<p>Then click on the publication entitled:</p>
<p>&#8220;A SECOND GENERATION HUMAN HAPMAP with over 3.1mil SNP&rsquo;s&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4phy5lv" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/4phy5lv</a></p>
<p>Look at the huge number of institutions that took part (72) All the major genetic institutions from all over the world.</p>
<p>AND HERE are their findings:</p>
<p>&#8220;We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25–35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we know that</p>
<p>1) CNV differences between the races are 12%<br>
2) SNP differences between the races are 25-35%.</p>
<p>Note that this is a second generation Hapmap study. The first was the HGP.<br>
The human genome project concluded that all humans are 99.9% identical based on SNP analysis.</p>
<p>How they did this considering that they only had the genome of one person is beyond me. This one genomes was also spliced together from multiple donors, so effectively it could not be used for any science apart to say that they had mapped the first human genome.</p>
<p>The second generation study as linked above proved that the real SNP difference is 25-35%. HUGE&hellip;.</p>
<p>If the human genome is likened to a book, then a single SNP difference is a single word spelt wrong and a single CNV is a whole page that is different.</p>
<p>Genetics have proved huge genetic differences between the races.</p>
<p>This is SCIENCE fact.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t liberals always claim that we have to celebrate our diversity. This is of course a lie, for they pretend that we have no diversity at all in order to further their creation of their one world Marxist government.<br>

<p>Great stuff! Smart!  Question. In your banana analogy what would be CNV and SNP? Sorry I only taken basic mircobiology, anatomy, and physcio classes. I haven&rsquo;t taken any genetic yet courses.</p>
<p>Diversity can only be maintained through separation.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism with all of the friction and disharmony, will ultimately lead to assimilation and dilution of different peoples and cultures and thus we will be all the same.</p>
<p>Some say that will end wars. True ethnic/racial conflicts will be no more because everyone is one and the same.</p>
<p>But like the boy in &#8220;The Giver&#8221; he escapes from the dystopia to a world filled with color, pain, love, etc.</p>

		<p>A SNP is a &#8220;SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM&#8221; and a <br>
CNV is a &#8220;COPY NUMBER VARIATION&#8221;</p>
<p>In layman&rsquo;s terms the best presentation would be to like the human genome(DNA code) to a book filled with writing.</p>
<p>If you were to compare two books to each other then a single letter difference between two words would constitute a SNP difference.</p>
<p>A single CNV(copy number variation) on the other hand would indicate a whole page that is different.</p>
<p>So between the different races we not only have between 25-35% of words that are spelled differently for every 100 pages,but we have 12 pages for every 100 pages that are completely different.   <br>

&#8220;Whereas SNPs are analogous to a single-letter misprint in a word in an instruction manual, CNVs are analogous to having a page of the manual torn out completely, or pasted in upside down.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think we can all safely say that Canada ( those who know the place, ) will be a &#8220;cold Brazil &#8221; in a few short years . White Europeans have been pushed aside ..oddly enough by other whites, the  ruling class white Europeans who dedicated their lives to the popular genocidal sport of destroy whitey . It is difficult to explain this self destructive sport, it began it seems in the fifties ( I was a boy in Europe when the plaque started in earnest.) I have never really put my finger on who started the ball rolling . After the second war there was a call from certain parts, to practice genocide in the remains of Germany , killing all Germans. Who called for this I wonder. It began there I think .</p>
