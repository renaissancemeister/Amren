<h1><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/9/book-lincoln-sought-to-deport-freed-slaves/">Book: Lincoln Sought to Deport Freed Slaves</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Dinan, Washington Times, February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Great Emancipator was almost the Great Colonizer: Newly released documents show that to a greater degree than historians had previously known, President Lincoln laid the groundwork to ship freed slaves overseas to help prevent racial strife in the U.S.</p>
<p>Just after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln authorized plans to pursue a freedmen&rsquo;s settlement in present-day Belize and another in Guyana, both colonial possessions of Great Britain at the time, said Phillip W. Magness, one of the researchers who uncovered the new documents.</p>
<p>Historians have debated how seriously Lincoln took colonization efforts, but Mr. Magness said the story he uncovered, to be published next week in a book, &#8220;Colonization After Emancipation: Lincoln and the Movement for Black Resettlement,&#8221; shows the president didn&rsquo;t just flirt with the idea, as historians had previously known, but that he personally pursued it for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way that Lincoln historians have grappled with colonization has always been troublesome. {snip} What we know now is he did continue the effort for at least a year after the proclamation was signed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Magness said the key documents he and his co-author, Sebastian N. Page, a junior research fellow at Oxford, found were in British archives, and included an order authorizing a British colonial agent to begin recruiting freed slaves to be sent to the Caribbean in June 1863.</p>
<p>By early 1864, the scheme had fallen apart, with British officials fretting over the legality of the Emancipation Proclamation and the risk that the South could still win the war, and with the U.S. Congress questioning how the money was being spent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Belize and Guyana efforts followed other aborted colonization attempts in present-day Panama and on an island off the coast of Haiti, which actually received several hundred freed slaves in 1862, but failed the next year.</p>
<p>Michael Burlingame, chair of Lincoln Studies at the University of Illinois at Springfield, said {snip} &#8220;So many people in the North said we will not accept emancipation unless it is accompanied by colonization,&#8221; said Mr. Burlingame, adding that Lincoln himself had always made clear colonization would be voluntary and nobody would be forced out of the United States.</p>
<p>The newly released documents underscore just how hot a topic colonization was in the 1800s, when prominent statesmen debated whether blacks and whites could ever live together in a functioning society.</p>
<p>Earlier in the century, the American Colonization Society already had organized efforts to ship thousands of black Americans to Africa to the colony of Liberia, and the debate over colonization raged even within the black community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the U.S. documents about the Belize and Guyana deals have gone missing, but Mr. Magness and his co-author tracked down what he called an &#8220;almost untapped treasure cache of Civil War-era records&#8221; from the British side that showed Lincoln&rsquo;s deep involvement in the planning and authorization.</p>
<p>With 4 million blacks in the U.S. at the time of the war, colonization would have been a tricky and pricey move.</p>
<p>The Belize project&rsquo;s first shipment of laborers would have only been 500, and even if the project had been seen through to fruition, it would have accommodated just 50,000.<br>

		<p>40 acres and a mule in some western territory that would have become an independent country would have been the best and easiest move.  Along with a constitutional amendment banning black/African immigration to the United States and declining citizenship to freed slaves who refused or failed to go to the new territory.</p>
<p>Opportunity lost.<br>

		<p>There is a moment of lost opportunity, barely glimpsed at the time, in which the entire future of the county could have<br>
been entirely different. 1861-1865 was the American moment.<br>
Lincoln seemed to understand that freedom from slavery and<br>
separation of black and white were two sides of the same issue.<br>
I wonder if the Union Army and the Confederate Army could have<br>
joined forces after the war to make Black resettlement happen?<br>

		<p> The tone of this article, once you sift through all the slumgullion, is: Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been TERRIBLE if this colonization scheme had actually been brought to fruition? and, How can we massage these facts around so as to make Lincoln look more like the image of him that liberals have been so fond of for 150 years: The &#8220;Great Emancipator?&#8221;.</p>
<p> Perhaps instead he should have been called the Great Prognosticator, as he appears to have known in his very bones that a society with blacks and Whites mixed together would not &#8220;work&#8221; harmoniously, in the long run. Time has proved his long-range vision very true about that matter.</p>
<p> Emancipation came 148 years ago; we have had no real racial peace since then. Friction, turmoil, race riots, a whole era of agitation, and a racial shakedown industry based on the exploitation of carefully nursed and petted &#8220;grievances,&#8221; all have resulted in part because Lincoln&rsquo;s vision was not pursued to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p> Perhaps each one of us who believes as the posters on this website do, should look for the opportunity to speak this sentence, at the appropriate place and time, such as when a black is going on loudly and self-righteously about &#8220;slavery&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; ad nauseum: &#8220;Yes, you&rsquo;re right; bringing your ancestors over here from Africa was the biggest, most grievous error the ancestors of a few of us ever made.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Down South, we hate Lincoln, just as White Christ tells us to.</p>
<p>But every time we read what Lincoln knew about the blacks, as he said  plainly in his debate with Douglas in 1858, we hate him just a little bit less.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to this new document, we can hate him just a little bit less again, because we can prove that his race realism survived the extremist war measure of claiming to emancipate the blacks.  Emancipation meant freedom from work and liberty to go berserk in an orgy of robbing, raping, and murdering our Southern ladies and children while their men were in battle defending the righteous and right honorable name of John C. Calhoun, a White Christian, as is always meet and right so to do.</p>
<p>Lincoln was more rational about the blacks than our Southern ancestors were- he didn&rsquo;t want them anywhere nearby, but we surrounded ourselves with them and then forced our White Religion upon them so that they would be equalized with us up in Heaven, which now means they can rape our daughters by claiming that lily White skin is materialized &#8220;unearned White privilege,&#8221; which is just enough consent to avoid prison.</p>
<p>We wanted spiritual equality with Africans, and now we have African grandchildren.  Gawd, what a curse!</p>
<p>Transcend diversity always, embrace Whiteness forever, beware an prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip;  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Colonization After Emancipation: Lincoln and the Movement for Black Resettlement,&#8221; by Phillip W. Magness et al is not the first book to show Lincoln &#8220;didn&rsquo;t just flirt with the idea [colonization], as historians had previously known, but that he personally pursued it for some time.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Another notable contribution is Wake Forest University historian Paul D. Escott&rsquo;s What Shall We Do With the Negro? Lincoln, White Racism, and Civil War America (2009).  Escott quotes Lincoln: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The enterprise [colonization of blacks abroad] is a difficult one; but &lsquo;when there is a will there is a way&rsquo;; and what colonization needs most is a hearty will.  Will springs from the two elements of moral sense and self-interest.  Let us be brought to believe that it is morally right, and, at the same time, favorable to, or, at least not against, our interest, to transfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do it, however great the task may be.&rdquo; Lincoln, June, 1857 ( p. 25)</p>
<p><br>
* * *</p>
<p>Escott continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In August [1862] Lincoln sought an interview at the White House with a committee of black leaders, His purpose was to push them to support a colonization project that he and his cabinet had been discussing since October, 1861. Congressional legislation had made six hundred thousand dollars available to support colonization &hellip; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Raising first the question of why black Americans should leave the country, he bluntly told his visitors, &lsquo;You and we are different races.  We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.  Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them, by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence.&rsquo;  No black man, Lincoln argued, was allowed equality &lsquo;on this broad continent,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I cannot alter it if I would.&rsquo;  Now because slavery existed, white men were suffering; they were &lsquo;cutting one another&rsquo;s throats.&rsquo; Therefore, the president concluded, &lsquo;it is better for us both &hellip; to be separated.&rsquo;  Then, before touting the advantages of Central America &hellip; Lincoln presumed to instruct the black leaders on their duty toward their race. &lsquo;There are free men among you,&rsquo; Lincoln recognized, who were not inclined to leave their country.  These men could not see their &lsquo;comfort&rsquo; advanced by colonization and therefore preferred to stay in the United States.  This, the president declared, was &lsquo;an extremely selfish view of the case.&rsquo;&rdquo; Paul D. Escott, &ldquo;What Shall We Do With the Negro?&rdquo; Lincoln, White Racism, and Civil War America (2009), pp 53-54</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor colonization.&rdquo; Abraham Lincoln, December, 1862</p>

		<p>White Southerners&rsquo; egos are too big for them to realize they were wrong.  White Southerners supported the importation of millions of black Africans into the newly founded WHITE colonies of America.  This importation of black Africans as cheap labor into white societies laid the foundation for the situation white people face today of mass immigration of non-whites as cheap labor into white societies worldwide.  If it wasn&rsquo;t for the British blockading ships in the late 1700s and early 1800s from taking black Africans out of Africa and the Civil War the problem would have never ended.  America would have been in great shape if white people stuck with white labor.  White people got to the point of being the first group to circle the globe through white only labor.</p>

Hardly more expensive than the accumulated costs of having them here in our country. And one wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to colonize all blacks at once. They could have simply given special assistance to young blacks and blacks with children to leave, making sure that the most fertile generations settled abroad. All that money that was being put into the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau (the proto-black welfare state) could have instead been used to help blacks resettle abroad. And it would have actually paid off in the long run.</p>

		<p>Also interesting was what repatriated former slaves free born blacks did soon after colonizing Liberia- enslave africans. And though today, comprising no more than 5% of the population, Americo-Liberians became the ruling class. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get why this is even considered offensive.  If today&rsquo;s blacks view slaves as victims of kidnapping, then shouldn&rsquo;t they want the victims of kidnapping returned to their homes?</p>

<p>There it is in a nutshell. NOT forced. Controlled and encouraged but not forced. And if done right and with proper measures taken, amicably arrived at by all parties, there is a question about the concept?</p>
<p>Personally, I would suspect that most of those proposed destinations now would be far better off for the effort than they are today.</p>

		<p>As I said on the other Lincoln thread giving them Florida for their own country would have been an ideal solution.  Give them the lower 3/4ths of Florida and set up a military cordon 10 miles deep between the U.S. and New Africa in which development is prohibited.  This could easily have been accomplished. </p>
