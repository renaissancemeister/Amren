<h1>Md. Bill Seeks to Rename Negro, Polish Mountains</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Centre Daily Times (State College, Pennsylvania), February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lisa Gladden, D-Baltimore City, introduced Senate Joint Resolution 3 in the General Assembly Thursday with eight Democratic co-sponsors. It would create a commission to rename Negro Mountain in Garrett County and Polish Mountain in Allegany County by year&rsquo;s end &#8220;to reflect more accurately the history and culture of the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both ridges extend north into Pennsylvania, as does Big Savage Mountain, another name Gladden finds objectionable.</p>
<p>She said Negro Mountain has irked her since she first visited western Maryland as a state delegate-elect in 1998.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawmakers from the state&rsquo;s mountainous western panhandle said the bill reflects political correctness run amok among legislators from the Baltimore-Washington area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill revives a debate that last peaked in the mid-1990s when the Domestic Names Committee of the U.S. Board of Geographic Names refused to rechristen Negro Mountain as Black Hero Mountain. The committee found that the mountain&rsquo;s name was not applied in a derogatory sense.</p>
<p>Historical records contain two stories about the naming of Negro Mountain, which rises to 3,075 feet in Maryland, and 3,213 feet in Pennsylvania. In one account, a free black frontiersman named Nemesis was killed during a skirmish with Indians in 1756 while serving in a militia during the French and Indian War.</p>
<p>In the other version, a large black servant named Goliath was killed while protecting his master, Capt. Andrew Friend, from an Indian attack on their hunting party.</p>
<p>Gladden suggested the mountain be rechristened Mount Nemesis.</p>
<p>Sen. Jennie Forehand, D-Montgomery, said both Negro and Polish mountains should have prettier names.</p>

		<p>The 1940s era USGS Topographical Quandrangle map for Forkland, Alabama showed a stream named &#8220;N*****foot Creek&#8221;. This map was revised in the 1970s and the name was changed to &#8220;Negrofoot&#8221; Creek. </p>
<p>Of course if a black politician now sees &#8220;Negrofoot&#8221; Creek on that map he will call in the cameras and reporters.</p>

		<p>I passed Negro Mountain once while driving through Maryland.  I would have bet the name was a euphemism for a different term.  And I was also sure that the name would one day be contested by some race-conscious black or politically correct white.</p>
<p>If they re-name it, say, Green Mountain (for the color of its foliage), some race-conscious black or politically correct white will insist it be named Black Mountain to retain its historical significance.  </p>
<p>And then some future race-conscious black or politically correct white will insist it be re-named because &#8220;black&#8221; is a racist, pejoritive term for &#8220;African-American.&#8221; </p>
<p>And &#8220;The Struggle&#8221; goes on&hellip;and on&hellip;</p>

		<p>LISA what do you people do, lay awake nights dreaming of ways to find RACISM in everything you see, touch or do?</p>
<p>This is the problem with blacks instead of getting on with their lives and doing something of value their whole world seems to be built around the idea that they are owed everything and they owe everyone else NOTHING.</p>
<p>Why does it always have to be about YOU PEOPLE the word negro means black in Spanish and some other languages believe me I can assure you African black were not even thought of when this mountain range was named. Not even a inkling of consideration was considered to link this mountain range with African Americans as you like to be called (Today).</p>
<p>Just as a side note, a man I work with who is white was born in Africa at the age of 14 his family who mined industrial diamonds moved to America. In filling out an application for a loan he put down that he was African/American they told him he could not do that because only blacks could use that designation even though they had never stepped foot into Africa and he had actually been born there.  </p>

		<p>I see no problem with removing any reference to blacks from all monuments, natural and otherwise, in the United States.</p>
<p>Let it be as if they were never there&hellip;</p>
<p>I also find this organization to be racist-</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uncf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uncf.org/</a></p>
<p>And believe that they should be immediately disbanded and made to apologize to every gifted person whose college education was denied them because of unfair access to college scholarships as a function of AA race quotas which are _specifically illegal_ in the very 1964/65 race acts which created them.</p>
<p>As a racist organization, all UNCF status as a charity should be revoked and their funds immediately reapportioned, by GPA, IQ and SAT scores to a -race neutral- college fund for benefit of the top 20% of all American students who have the greatest likelihood of making a useful contribution to society from a college education.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that this woman has such a low opinion of her race that she thinks a neutral term describing it must be removed (&#8220;negro,&#8221; by the way, is a word that means &#8220;black&#8221; in more than one language. Perhaps the word should be expunged from all the world&rsquo;s languages, too, just because she doesn&rsquo;t like the modern-day sound of it. </p>
<p>These blacks in public positions, like members of the NAACP who think the term &#8220;black hole&#8221; is a racist slur, continue to show their ignorance on a daily basis. </p>
<p>And what about when the word black is no longer viewed as an acceptable term? These mountains will have to have their names changed on a regular basis. Why not just play it completely safe and give the mountain an African name, except that it isn&rsquo;t in Africa?</p>
<p>Blacks continue to show the ignorance, short-sightedness and parochial attitude that causes the terms describing them to have to be changed every few years, because they start taking on negative connotations.</p>

		<p>As the struggle goes ever onwards what ever are they going to do about those Black Hills of Dakota? If Sen Gladden decides to visit Australia she will find that Black Mountain is a very prominant landmark in Canberra. Then there is an nation in the Balkans which is called  Montenegro, translates quite simply to Negro Mountain!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dreadful world out there Sen. Gladden!</p>

		<p> Yes, among the peckerwoods, Negro Mountain was called the &#8220;N&#8221; word Mountain for a long time. I honestly thought Negro Mountain was a big improvement, and the polite locals usually use the term. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly is wrong with Polish Mountain? Don&rsquo;t they like Poles? I&rsquo;ve never heard a single Polish person complain. In fact, some have told me they&rsquo;d like to go huntin&rsquo; there. </p>

		<p>If blacks want equal opportunity and general acceptance, they must stop whining about trivialities and accept a co-equal status.  Any group that demands special treatment gains nothing but resentment from society in general, and anyone in the group who continues to make the same mistake over and over looks like a buffoon.</p>

		<p>Yes, Blackbutt is the name of a very common tree here! There is a Blackbutt reserve, it is a very popular park in the NSW City of Newcastle.</p>
<p>Also, a correction, Montenegro means Land of the Black/Dark mountains. (And as a previous poster has mentioned Negro simply means &#8220;dark&#8221; as in colour.)</p>
<p>I also understand there is a Negros river and province somewhere in South America.</p>
<p>Oh Dear Sen. Gladden, there are so many dark forces out there and they all seem to be intent on destroying the society that has given you everything.<br>

		<p>Yet, another perfect example why blacks are the inferior culture when contrasted with others; this  black Md. politician sees names of mountains as a problem or irritant but not the dis-functional black community of Baltimore or D.C., etc.. . If blacks can ever duplicate White culture and prioritize what problems are major and which as far less serious, blacks will always act black and never advance their supposed culture.</p>

<p>Actually, it was tried years ago, back in the 1980s, I think.  But it failed due to the fact that the name was linked in history to the 1960 Winter Olympic games that were held there.</p>
<p>However, many other place names using the term, &#8220;squaw&#8221; were changed during that time, led mostly by the American Indian Movement.</p>

		<p>There is a group of ponds in far northern Maine that used to be called First, Second, Third, and Fourth Negro Brook Lakes. They are just south of St. Francis in T16 R9 (that&rsquo;s township 16 range 9, to those from away.) Also, Squaw Mountain near Moosehead Lake, one of the ski areas in Maine, was renamed, along with all other Squaw names in Maine, under pressure from Maine Indian tribes.</p>

<p>Okay, I can understand renaming the mountains because they do have rather ugly-sounding names.  But they should not be renamed just to please angry black people!  And what about Polish Mountain?  Are there really a bunch of angry Pollacks in Maryland who are offended by having a mountain named after them? </p>

<p>This makes no sense to me.  Is the term &#8220;squaw&#8221; considered offensive by Indians?  I never thought squaw was an offensive term.  But then again, with minorities, anything can be made offensive.  Just look at how the perfectly respectable &#8220;negro&#8221; became a word considered by many to be worse than the f-word.</p>
