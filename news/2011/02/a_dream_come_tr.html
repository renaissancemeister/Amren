			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John McDonnell, Daily Mail (London), February 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Not even in his wildest dreams could Martin Luther King Jr have imagined that he would one day find himself honoured alongside two of America&rsquo;s best-known and best-loved presidents.</p>
<p>But Dr King is soon to stand shoulder to shoulder with Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson when a statue of the slain civil rights leader is unveiled in the National Mall in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The memorial will be positioned in a direct line between those dedicated to legendary former leaders Jefferson and Lincoln in the open-air national park, where King delivered his famous &#8216;I Have a Dream&rsquo; speech in 1963.</p>
<p>Dedication of the memorial will take place on August 28 this year, the 48th anniversary of the historic speech.</p>
<p>Jefferson and Lincoln  &mdash;  both of who appear in the famous Mount Rushmore sculpture  &mdash;  are widely regarded of two of the greatest ever leaders of the U.S.</p>
<p>The former was a Founding Father of America and author of the Declaration of Independence, while the latter is renowned for leading America through possibly its greatest ever crisis  &mdash;  the Civil War  &mdash;  by restoring the Union and ending slavery.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr is seen by many as a heroic leader in the history of modern American liberalism.</p>
<p>His tireless and impassioned campaigning in the African American civil rights movement lead to the ending of racial segregation and racial discrimination.</p>
<p>In 1964 he became the youngest ever person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his achievements using non-violent methods.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years in the making, King&rsquo;s memorial will be the first memorial on the National Mall to honour a non-U.S. President.</p>
<p>It will contain excerpts of his sermons and public addresses to serve as living testaments of his vision of America.</p>
<p>Its centrepiece, the towering Stone of Hope, will feature a 30-foot likeness of Dr King.</p>
<p>A replica was yesterday unveiled at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit.</p>
<p>It was a donation from the General Motors Foundation, General Motors and Chevrolet  &mdash;  who received the replica from the Martin Luther King, Jr Memorial Foundation to thank them for being major contributors to the charity.</p>

		<p>A sculpture of a guy wearing a suit and tie standing in a contrived looking hip hop pose.  How unique in it&rsquo;s post-modernist glory (snicker) a real symbol of x-gen artistic prowess&hellip; <br>
 <br>
How well will this ugly boulder blend in with all the classical and neo-classical works in the area?  Like a plastic Elvis doll next to the statue of Lincoln and expecting people NOT to notice the difference?</p>
<p>Get a REAL sculptor to carve REAL sculpture using REAL classical sensibilities.  Make it look like something representing a great nation.  Not like some college art project turned in for a grade by some sophomore who didn&rsquo;t finish it on time.</p>
<p>Any bets on who was tapped to carve the thing?  Let this stand as an example of the decline of the West in the realm of fine arts.  This is the equivalent of Rap as a replacement for Beethoven.</p>

Blacks are forever hoping and praying for THE magic bullet that will transform them in the eyes of the world and into the great people they believe themselves to be.</p>
<p>A great sports legend. A great civil rights hero. Black history month. They desperately want to believe that SOMETHING will change their fortune and their imagine.</p>
<p>Of course, it never happens and never will.</p>
<p>This monument and museum will not do anything to raise the status and image of blacks. They&rsquo;ll bring in bus loads of uninterested black (and white) school kids hoping to raise their self-esteem and show them what great and noble people they are.</p>
<p>They can have it. It won&rsquo;t make any difference.</p>

		<p>Thomas Jefferson was a liberal by 18th Century standards, was in principle opposed to slavery, even though he owned slaves himself, but still did not consider blacks to be equal to white people.  Even though he was the author of the words &#8220;We hold these to truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal..&#8221;</p>
<p>Jefferson could not get elected President today, not only because he was not a church member, but because of how he said, &#8220;Question with boldness even the existence God:&#8221;</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln could not get elected President today because he was not a church member.  Lincoln was morally opposed to slavery, but as can be seen in past articles of American Renaissance, was opposed to racial integration and equality for blacks in society.</p>
<p>Lincoln wanted to repatriate black people to Central America and have them form their seperate societies for the benefit of both the black and white races.  Did Honest Abe really have foresight of the racial tensions and problems that would happen if the races were allowed to mix? </p>

		<p>I have some respect for King because I think he knew he was risking his life by acting as he did. But I and many other believe his speeches were taken from the content of others, and King was a amoral womanizer. There in no way King deserves a memorial of this magnitude. This monstrosity monument is just another example of whites giving blacks things just because they are black and not because they are earned. There has never been a black of heroic stature like the many whites and there probably never will be. </p>

		<p>MLK was a small-time con man, catapulted into world prominence by forces he neither understood nor could control. King was a cheat, both in and out of school. A plagiarist is both liar and thief, and King the student was a plagiarist many times over. Off the schoolyard the philandering King cheated on his wife with underage girls. We might forgive these faults, if he&rsquo;d had some integrity. But the man who gravely intoned that men should be judged, not by the color of their skin, but rather by &#8220;the content of their character,&#8221; jumped at the notion of racial preferences for blacks. In the famous Playboy interview, when asked if blacks should get preference over whites, he replied, &#8220;Sure. Why not?&#8221; On his best day King wasn&rsquo;t fit to shine Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s shoes, and we should insist the FBI file on King be opened before even a penny of taxpayer money be spent on a memorial.

		<p>Reminds me of the Arthur Ashe statue they added to Monuement Avenue in Richmond a few years ago. Imagine, a statue of a black guy holding a tennis racket on a tree lined boulevard known for it&rsquo;s beautiful Confederate military-equestrian statues. To say it is out of place is something of an understatement. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered if the motivation for putting it there wasn&rsquo;t so much to be inclusive as to make the entire avenue sort of tacky, thereby undermining something beautiful and historical to whites and thus deeply threatening to blacks. </p>

		<p>The narrative of King was a good one.  He basically said, &#8220;treats us equally/fair, give us a fair shake/chance and we will do the rest.&#8221;  Didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>Well&hellip;the narrative changed to &#8220;well, we need to be a little more than equal, in the form of affirmative action.&#8221;  Didn&rsquo;t work. </p>

		<p>Since our government considers him the greatest American in our history - he is, after all the only one for whom there is a national holiday - I think it&rsquo;s totally appropriate for the statue to be there.  Neither Abe Lincoln nor Thomas Jefferson have a national holiday in their honor.  Only George Washington comes close - he had one, but it was taken away when it&rsquo;s designation was changed to &#8220;President&rsquo;s Day&#8221;.  WJ, St. Louis, MO </p>

		<p>#1 - If there&rsquo;s going to be a statue of King, I&rsquo;m glad it looks like this. The best thing would be no statue at all, but the worst thing would be a King statue in the same style as the Jefferson, Lincoln, etc. statues. At least this unsightly thing stands out from the classical monuments to real heroes and sends the message to the world&hellip;King was not like them.</p>

		<p>I consider the placement of this statue between two others of such a greater stature than MLK on the National Mall to be an act of cultural vandalism on the part of the United States government for all the reasons mentioned on this thread. The US government couldn&rsquo;t remove an existing statue without its agenda being obvious, so it added a statue that makes a mockery of the other two. Jefferson and Lincoln both would have despised MLK, who stood for the concept that this is a fundamentally flawed nation, while they thought this was a fundamentally good nation. Even the stance and facial expression of this statue reflects MLK&rsquo;s hatred, resentment and defiance of this nation and all that it stands for. By the way, the statue was designed by a Chinese, much to the disgust of some blacks. </p>

		<p>Another false monument to black failure. Ever notice that there seems to be only one black person who gets statues and praise and gets quoted, etc&hellip;It&rsquo;s Marty King.</p>
<p>Why? Because there is no other black that&rsquo;s a success (not counting sports/show biz - two fields where having a brain might even be a liability).</p>
<p>So they have elevated King to some saint-like status by re-writing history and conveniently overlooking his abominable moral behavior. </p>
<p>The fact that a statue of this clown is placed between Lincoln and Jefferson is heartbreaking. Why not just put up a statue of O.J. Simpson and be done with it?</p>
<p>This is white pandering of the highest level to the lowest of people. We have lost our minds.</p>

		<p>King delivered his speech in front of the reflecting pool between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.  No one there could even see the Jefferson Memorial.<br>
I wonder how long that pen that he is holding in his hand will last.<br>
Perhaps they will spend our tax dollars to put a 24 hour guard on it. <br>
Morningside Park in Harlem might be a more appropriate place for this monolith.<br>
I would call it a statue if it were finished.<br>

		<p>Without Martin Luther King, Jr. the 1960s would have been a different decade. More than any other single individual he caused changes what have made it possible for blacks who behave decently and perform competently to succeed in American society.<br>
 <br>
King&rsquo;s friendships with members of the American Communist Party would only be of legitimate concern if he passed classified information to the Soviet Union. There is no evidence that he did.<br>
 <br>
His academic plagiarism is of concern. It is also difficult to understand in one who composed some of the most memorable speeches and essays in the English language.<br>
 <br>
His womanizing was unacceptable in a married clergyman. Nevertheless, a man with his fame and charisma faces temptations I do not.   </p>

		<p>#1 Jonathan has excellent comments regarding this matter.  Let me add that by making the statue so tall and bulky, the conceivers have created a monument much more akin to the one of Saddam that was pulled down after his deposing.  And, to me, it doesn&rsquo;t look enough like MLK to be recognizable.  It&rsquo;s like some fungible image of a black man, bought in a cheap shop in Asia, and plopped into a black city to appease black people. </p>

		<p>Besides being an esthetic disaster the new MLK monument with its significant expanse of horizontal surface area will provide an ample congregation area for many birds.  Therefore, the aviary population will make a profound statement about ML King with their natural byproducts that our leaders are petrified to do.</p>

		<p>If there is an upside to King it is the fact that he opposed US intervention in Vietnam. And if the US had stayed out of Vietnam, there wouldn&rsquo;t be over a million Vietnamese in America voting for the rapid race-replacement of  Native Born White Americans. Something to think about.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Whites and Blacks have very little in common. So already, before the passage of the America destroying 1965 Immigration Reform Act, there were two separate nations that did not like each other. In America 2011, there are now three other separate race-based nations:the Hispanic nation,The Asian nation and the Muslim nation. All three are growing very rapidly. All three-in addition to the Black nation-are voting to make Native Born White Americans a rapidly dwindlinig racial minority within the borders of America. It is not unreasonable to assume that King would be in favor of racial minority status for Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>There is a major catastrophe in the making. It is going to be very painfull when it explodes full-blown on American soil. Millions of Native Born White Americans should have seen it comming. No excuses.</p>
<p>We need to separate from Blacks. We need to expell post-1965 high fertility Asians,Hispanics,Africans and Muslims. The consequences of not doing this will be catastrophic for White Americans. Nothing could be more obvious.</p>
<p>There is a direct line from the Civil Rights movement for Blacks..right to the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act..and&hellip; right to the ongoing race-replacement of  Native Born White Americans. Considering how the image of Martin Luther King is used by the race-replacement enthusiasts in Corporate America-just take a look at the car commercials,by the race-replacement enthusiasts in the Pentagon-just take a look at the recruiting ads-and by the race-replacement enthusiasts in both the Republican and Democratic parties..Martin Luther King should be considered the mortal enemy of Native Born White America. </p>

<p>I was alive in the 1960s and up for the draft.  What I recall about MLK then, is something that is well known now as it was then; he was a communist.  The other reason he opposed the war was actually because it DISTRACTED from his movement.  He tried to link black oppression with the drafting of blacks into the armed forces.  That tension showed up in the field in Vietnam often enough.  MLK saw everything, including white people as tools for his use, and as we know, he talked a very different game than he walked.</p>

		<p>If Martin Luther King, Jr. had lived he would have been given leadership of the anti war movement. There were prominent members of that movement. None had the commanding presence of Martin Luther King. <br>
 <br>
As leader he may have been able to dissuade the anti war movement from behaving in ways that harmed its message. Beginning with the riot at the Democratoc National Convention in 1968 the anti war movement made itself, rather than the war, the issue. By 1969 many Americans who thought the War in Vietnam was a mistake disliked those who demonstrated against it.<br>
 <br>
Vietnam was unimportant to our economy and our security. The message the anti war movement should have sent to middle aged parents of draft age youths would have been, &#8220;Your sons do not need to fight in Vietnam.&#8221; Unfortunately, the message many received from the anti war movement was, &#8220;If your sons fight, they deserve to be killed.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Martin Luther King was unable to stop the black ghetto riots that happened from 1964 to 1968, and which more than any other factor made the United States a Republican country. Most who demonstrated against the War were college students and college graduates. Most would have listened to King&rsquo;s advice.</p>

		<p>The first public sermon that King ever gave, in 1947 at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, was plagiarized from a homily by Protestant clergyman Harry Emerson Fosdick entitled &#8220;Life is What You Make It,&#8221; according to the testimony of King&rsquo;s best friend of that time, Reverend Larry H. Williams. </p>
<p>The first book that King wrote, &#8220;Stride Toward Freedom, - -was plagiarized from numerous sources, all unattributed, according to documentation recently assembled by sympathetic King scholars Keith D. Miller, Ira G. Zepp, Jr., and David J. Garrow.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s essay, &#8220;The Place of Reason and Experience in Finding God,&#8221; written at Crozer, pirated passages from the work of theologian Edgar S. Brightman, author of &#8220;The Finding of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another of King&rsquo;s theses, &#8220;Contemporary Continental Theology,&#8221; written shortly after he entered Boston University, was largely stolen from a book by Walter Marshall Horton. </p>
<p>According to &#8220;The Martin Luther King Papers&#8221;, in King&rsquo;s dissertation &#8220;only 49 per cent of sentences in the section on Tillich contain five or more words that were King&rsquo;s own&hellip;.&#8221;!</p>
<p>According to Assistant Director Sullivan, who had direct access to the surveillance files on King which are denied the American people, King had embezzled or misapplied substantial amounts of money contributed to the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement. King used SCLC funds to pay for liquor, and numerous prostitutes both Black and White, who were brought to his hotel rooms, often two at a time, for drunken sex parties which sometimes lasted for several days. These types of activities were the norm for King&rsquo;s speaking and organizing tours.</p>
<p>In fact, an outfit called The National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, which is putting on display the two bedrooms from the Lorraine Motel where King stayed the night before he was shot, has declined to depict in any way the &#8220;occupants - -of those rooms. That &#8220;according to exhibit designer Gerard Eisterhold &#8220;would be &#8220;close to blasphemy.&#8221; The reason? Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spent his last night on Earth having sex with two women at the motel and physically beating and abusing a third.<br>

		<p>Unattractive statue.  If we must have one, it should have been done better.  I sometimes watch Beck, who is opposed to socialism and progressivism and buys into MLK&rsquo;s content of our character.  He&rsquo;s not stupid and I&rsquo;m sure knows what King really believed.  So instead of lying why doesn&rsquo;t Beck and others who really know better just shut up and stop making things up.  They don&rsquo;t even have to say that King DID NOT believe in a colorblind society and open themselves up to nonstop attacks, cries of racism, threats of violence, boycotts and maybe firings.  But just please stop making fools of yourselves by pandering.  MLK supporters don&rsquo;t like you and never will.</p>
<p>I agree completely with Jupiter7&rsquo;s view of the 1965 Immigration Act.  </p>

<p>Ugly, fascist, nasty piece of work - the sculpture, that is - do those who commissioned it think it a proper commentary on the man?</p>

		<p>I tend to agree with #8 and #11 more than with the negative comments. Some of the photos you can google of MLK with LBJ are quite touching. Most are unposed, with both men deeply contemplating and discussing what should be done and how to realize it politically.</p>
<p>These two deeply flawed but insightful individuals had a deep impact on future events at a pivotal point in history. The status quo was untenable, but I think both would be extremely angry at the turns events have since taken. Neither man believed in affirmative action, and neither expected blacks to behave like whiney, spoiled children once they got their civil rights.</p>

		<p>After reading this I was reminded of a line spoken by the main character in the TV series Firefly. The episode was called &#8220;Jaynestown&#8221;; it first aired in 2002.</p>
<p>Malcolm Reynolds: &#8220;It&rsquo;s my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of sommbitch or another. It ain&rsquo;t about the person, Jayne. It&rsquo;s about what people need&#8221;.</p>
<p>What we have here is the quintessential life-imitates-art scenario: The statue ain&rsquo;t about dear ol&rsquo; Mikey; it&rsquo;s about what blacks need, and what blacks need is something, anything, to make them feel that their race is a positive contribution to the world&hellip;despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>MLK excuseologists, covering for his communist sympathizing and anti-white racism, claim his opposition to &#8216;Nam was due to military spending drawing down from social welfare.  The flaw with that excuse is by 1968, all of the Great Society was in place, and its costs were growing, not decreasing.  Too, &#8216;Nam started growing in American commitment (and therefore cost) after &#8220;Tonkin,&#8221; and that was &#8216;64.  While it was happening, various G/S welfare programs were being passed and implemented.  The reason the Federal government could have its cake and eat it too was because income tax rate brackets were not indexed to inflation (and they weren&rsquo;t until 1985), therefore the higher tax rates (there were a lot of brackets back then) that were in earlier days only for the very well to do, more and more middle class households started falling into them.  Subtle and un-noticed tax increases year by year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that by 1968, Democrats in the House and Senate just thought they had already passed all the social welfare programs they needed to, and Republican gains in the 1966 mid-terms kinda put the brakes on future growth anyway.  As an aside, Section 8 rent vouchers were the only transfer payment program that is in frequent use today that wasn&rsquo;t enacted either in the New Deal or the Great Society   &mdash;   Those didn&rsquo;t start until the mid-70s, though the bureaucratic groundwork was laid in the G/S.  MLK simply thought that no new welfare programs were passed only because of the growing costs of &#8216;Nam.  Correlation without causation.</p>
<p>Besides that, the great under-reported political story of the late 1960s was opposition to &#8216;Nam from the isolationist right, centered on the John Birch Society but including a lot of other groups.  But they were largely drowned out by the anti-white anti-American pro-communist kook left on one end and the military-industrial complex lamestream left-right Republocrats on the other end.  Media attention given to the hippie left actually scared the isolationist right into hands of pro-war rightist political figures.</p>

<p>I agree with your post. The antiwar movement was represented by degenerates such as Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. The antiwar movement was way bigger than these two attention getters. There was honest-to-God, grassroots opposition in the conservative Heartland of America to the Vietnam War. Jessie Ventura has written about his WWII veteran, highly decorated father, who adamantly opposed Jessie and his brother joining the military during the Vietnam war era. The US government had a very difficult time prosecuting army desertion cases  in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, South and North Dakota because the local population was so opposed to the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Right before he died, the degenerate and poet Allan Ginsberg stated that the counter cultural anti-war protesters &#8220;blew it big time&#8221;-his own words- because they completely alienated conservative Heartland Whites. That&rsquo;s quite a death bed confession.</p>
<p>King&rsquo;s protegee, the gangster-race-hustler Jesse Jackson, is a notorious race-replacement enthusiast. The iconic image of Martin Luther King-since it is now so  deeply interwoven with  Corporate interests and power-is among other things,  deeply interwoven into the fabric of the anti-white race-replacement ideology.</p>

<p>The first book that King wrote, &ldquo;Stride Toward Freedom, - -was plagiarized from numerous sources, all unattributed, according to documentation recently assembled by sympathetic King scholars Keith D. Miller, Ira G. Zepp, Jr., and David J. Garrow.<br>

Plagiarism is only plagiarism if it is word for word, and unattributed. I am not saying Martin Luther King never did that; I am saying one should not be too quick to accuse him.<br>
 <br>
Most writers are influenced by previous writers. Most of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plots were borrowed. <br>
 <br>
King&rsquo;s &#8220;I have a dream&#8221; speech paraphrased Psalm 30:5, Amos 5:24, Isaiah 40:4-5, and the opening lines of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Richard III.  Nevertheless, it would be unfair to say that he plagiarized these passages.  </p>

<p>&#8220;If Martin Luther King, Jr. had lived he would have been given leadership of the anti war movement. There were prominent members of that movement. None had the commanding presence of Martin Luther King.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I simply don&rsquo;t agree.  He was so wrapped up in the Civil Rights issue that was hard enough to control (prevent rioting) that all he could do was voice his opposition.  This wouldn&rsquo;t have changed had he lived.  The forces of opposition from Chicago (Rubens and The Weather Underground) were already well entrenched and solidly guiding the anti-war movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;As leader he may have been able to dissuade the anti war movement from behaving in ways that harmed its message. Beginning with the riot at the Democratoc National Convention in 1968 the anti war movement made itself, rather than the war, the issue. By 1969 many Americans who thought the War in Vietnam was a mistake disliked those who demonstrated against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been draft riots in the past, including as I am sure you know, our Civil War. Again, I don&rsquo;t believe MLK with his &#8220;charisma&#8221; would have been listened to by the mostly white anti-war movement.  Maybe you don&rsquo;t realize how separate these two movements were.  Actually, there was a real sense of segregation; the two things are often melded together in retrospect, but at the time, they were palpably separate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vietnam was unimportant to our economy and our security. The message the anti war movement should have sent to middle aged parents of draft age youths would have been, &ldquo;Your sons do not need to fight in Vietnam.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the message many received from the anti war movement was, &ldquo;If your sons fight, they deserve to be killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt; I&rsquo;m afraid I completely disagree with you here.  The U.S. Government Civilian Employees at the many military installations, most of which have been either torn down or converted to private use by the early 1990s, were a major part of the nation&rsquo;s economy then.  This includes private companies like Northrop/Gruman, and dozens of others included in the nations then vast military industrial complex.  I actually recall hearing people say that they wanted the war because it was good for business.  Eisenhower had warned that allowing the interests of the military industrial complex to dominate would cause war and take the nation in dangerous directions.  What a prophet he was.  But he was funding the French in Vietnam secretly and sending U.S, Advisers, even as he said it.  Finally, far from the anti-war movement was what many of us young men, still teens were hearing our parents say, &#8220;We would rather see you die in Vietnam than admit we were wrong.&#8221;  We young men of the Baby Boom Generation got it from all sides.  Only the women made out well through feminism.  And there were the Fortunate Sons like GW Bush or even Clinton who found ways around the mess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Luther King was unable to stop the black ghetto riots that happened from 1964 to 1968, and which more than any other factor made the United States a Republican country. Most who demonstrated against the War were college students and college graduates. Most would have listened to King&rsquo;s advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t comprehend your first sentence.  Maybe you are using Republican in place of democratic (small d)?  But the race riots were riots, and riots and violence occurs when peaceful means fail.  Anyway, the communities that suffered from the rioters had rights to not be violated.  On the second sentence, I just disagree.  No one could have stopped the violent protests because the whole thing had gone too far by 1968.  The assassinations of RFK and MLK were just part of the entire thing.  You also seem to be assigning to MLK the mythic status he has now, to what he actually was then.  He had competition in the Civil Rights leadership movement.  People like Malcom X, Huey Newton, and others who called him an &#8220;Uncle Tom.&#8221;  White kids didn&rsquo;t worship MLK the way they do now.  His death made him more than he was in life.  In fact, more white kids probably choose not to be violent because of that, saving us from possibly even worse anti-war rioting than actually occurred.  But Black violence increased greatly.  The Black Panthers rose to higher power, the Nation of Islam gained in power, The Zebra Killer a black serial killer specializing in killing whites in SF, and Patti Hearst was kidnapped, raped, and brainwashed into the black led SLA.  It was a bad time and MLK has unduly been raised up as its universal hero.</p>

<p>Interesting post, the whole thing.  I just wanted to point out here that both Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman were from Chicago.  They came to Berkeley, CA to incite the already active student body government, to become more radicalized and on board with the anti-war movement, and try to also involve the greatly uninterested hippie movement in San Francisco.  The first hippies didn&rsquo;t care much about politics, they had removed themselves from concern from the world altogether, that was part of their original idea.  Rubin and Hoffman were the center core of The Vietnam Day Committee (of which by the way Whoopie Goldberg was a member)and two of the Chicago Seven.  The Weathermen Underground established itself and declared war on the U.S. Government due to the arrest trial of the Chicago Seven.  The bombings they carried out in various locations including the Pentagon and the State Department Building were unprecedented.  So you cannot really say that these guys were amateur attention getter types.  They were dead serious and knew how to cause a ruckus.  </p>
<p>The states you list as anti-war states are not really Heartland states, but northern frontier states, famous for their tendency toward isolation from the government.  It is both of little surprise that they would be against the war, since they were populated by the same majority German settlers as Chicago and Milwaukee in the 19th century.  I did a little research and found that the first labor unions were formed in Chicago and Milwaukee in the late 19th century and that they also had the first Socialist Party Movements established in the late 19th century - but beginning as early as 1865, immediately after the CW ended.  This was mostly due to the fact that most of them read German and Karl Marx and other German socialist works were most easily assimilated into the cultures.  At least this explains several bits of modern history, including the current union busting protests in Madison, WI., and the seeming deep set social liberalism of the region.</p>

Democrats who think the Democratic Party benefits from a wave of third world immigration are delusional. Republicans who think the Democratic Party benefits should go back to worrying about Communists hiding under their beds.<br>
 <br>
The high rate of immigration is one of a number of related factors that have made the white working class a staunch Republican constituency. This in turn has made it difficult for the Democrats to address the fact that the rich are getting richer as most pay checks buy less every year.<br>
 <br>
The New Deal was possible because immigration was restricted, and because civil rights legislation was not on the agenda. Blacks benefited from New Deal reforms. They did not benefit in ways that threatened white blue collar workers. </p>

		<p>All posters should take note: this is how societies change and transform.  When one people displaces another gradually, as we have now, the change in symbols and heroes and their meaning changes apace.</p>
<p>Of course quick and violent invasions sweep away the &#8216;old order&rsquo; instantly, as when the germanic tribes decimated the roman empire and its legacy crumbled in obscurity in many places for a long while.</p>
<p>Look at how amerika is &#8216;changing.&rsquo;  A road renamed here.  A statue replaced there.  A &#8216;sacred site&rsquo; established somewhere here or there, such as where a civil rights march happened or a graveyard with some slaves.  An endowed chair or new department in a college named after a chicano &#8216;activist&rsquo; gets established.  Towns or cities undergo race replacement and now they are &#8216;historically&rsquo; black areas. Learning in school transforms and becomes relevant to someone else. The president gets a nobel peace prize &#8216;in advance&rsquo; on the expectation that he will do something great one day because he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p>We, my friends, are being slowly erased.  The masochists and suicidal maniacs, otherwise known as social justice white liberals, sit by with glee as they set their own house on fire, dooming their children and grandchildren to poverty and fear.</p>
<p>We cannot stop it.  There&rsquo;s too many of them now and not enough political will to stop it.  I have embraced preparation as my philosophy.  Get some farmland.

Jefferson and Lincoln were real leaders, presidents that led our nation when this country needed real leadership. They were great men with real intelligence. MLK was a civil rights leader of a minority race. His morals as a man and as a Christian are open to question since he is suspect of plagarizing his, I have a dream speech, and his dissertation. The FBI wiretaps on him has found evidence of him cheating on his wife. So as a reward, we give this man a statue in the National Mall in DC.
