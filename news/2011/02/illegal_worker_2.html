<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41469433/ns/business/">Illegal Worker Crackdown Bites Chipotle</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Baertlein, Mary Milliken and Ed Stoddard, MSNBC, February 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chipotle Mexican Grill has a lot going for it  &mdash;  an upscale burrito concept, a hip and eco-friendly image, expansion plans galore and a 500 percent-plus stock price gain in just over two years. </p>
<p>And then it has something not going its way  &mdash;  a federal crackdown on its immigrant labor force that has so far forced Chipotle to fire hundreds of allegedly illegal workers in the state of Minnesota, perhaps more than half its staff there.</p>
<p>The probe is widening. Co-Chief Executive Monty Moran told Reuters on Friday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also issued &#8220;notices of inspection&#8221; for restaurants in Washington D.C. and Virginia.</p>
<p>Investors in the Wall Street darling are taking note and one firm, Calvert Investments, plans to talk to Chipotle about the large number of undocumented workers uncovered.</p>
<p>Dependence on illegal labor is the elephant in the room for the U.S. restaurant business. </p>
<p>And experts say the Chipotle ICE investigations are a wake-up call for an industry that is one of America&rsquo;s biggest employers and generates over $300 billion in annual sales, according to research firm IBISWorld Inc.</p>
<p>Chipotle  &mdash;  a Denver-based company whose motto is &#8220;Food With Integrity&#8221;  &mdash;  is one of the most well-known names caught in the immigration enforcement shift that began two years ago.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Onus &#8216;on employers now&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under Obama, immigration enforcement agents are cracking down on employers with so-called &#8220;I-9 audits&#8221;  &mdash;  I-9 being the employment eligibility verification form.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.S. fast-food industry historically has offered relatively low pay and paltry benefits to legal workers and, as a result, has struggled with high employee turnover.</p>
<p><b>Hardworking, loyal</b></p>
<p>Longnecker and other experts said restaurant owners are attracted to illegal laborers because they work hard, are loyal and will go the extra mile to hold down a job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But immigrants  &mdash;  both legal and illegal  &mdash;  account for about a quarter of workers in the restaurant and food services industry and their numbers are up in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The overall number of immigrants employed in the sector climbed from just over 1.7 million in 2008 to 1.8 million in 2010, according to this data, even as native employment fell from 6.4 million to 5.9 million.</p>
<p>The Pew Hispanic Center  &mdash;  whose demographic and labor market work is highly regarded  &mdash;  estimated in a 2009 report that 12 percent of the workforce in food preparation and serving in 2008 was undocumented.</p>

		<p>Illegals are loyal because they are illegal and do not want to bring notice to themselves (although I don&rsquo;t know why since the Feds won&rsquo;t deport them).  Too bad American companies are not loyal to Americans anymore.  Or America.</p>

		<p>A few years ago hundreds of people became ill here in Tuscaloosa after eating at a Mexican restaurant. They contracted a stomach bacteria that is transmitted through contact with human waste. It seems that some &#8220;found&#8221; its way into the salsa. The restaurant closed and never reopened.</p>
<p>This morning (2/8/2011) almost half of our local law enforcement was involved in chasing a drunk Mexican who was trying to escape after attempting to murder a police officer.</p>
<p>A year ago, a 21-year old girl was killed by a drunk driving illegal Mexican about 3 blocks from our home.</p>
<p>About 6 years ago a local college professor was decapitated by a 40 pound chunk of concrete thrown from an interstate overpass in Florida by an illegal Mexican teenager.</p>
<p>Last year nearly half of the homicides in our city were committed by Mexicans. The victims were all fellow Mexicans, including two infants. Our &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; population is only about 2 or 3% of the total population but their crime rate is 20 to 50 times as high as that committed by local blacks and whites. commit 10 to 20 times as many crimes as even local blacks.</p>

<p>This is the new American business model. Pay the lowest wages and pass the labor costs on to stock holders. It can&rsquo;t go on forever. The system is completely out of balance.</p>
<p>I was listening to c-span before I left for work this moring. A business owner called in and said that because of technology, he was able to fire all but one. He was proud of his achievement. <br>

		<p>One thing rarely mentioned in regards to illegal aliens is that the infectious disease rate in third world countries such as Mexico is much higher than it is in the U.S.  Legal alien immigrants must undergo an extensive medical inspection and submit medical records to U.S. Citizenshp and Immigration Services (CIS) before being granted visas.  However, no medical scrutiny is given to Rodrigo, the illegal alien from Honduras, who has hepatitis and who makes that sandwich at your favorite lunchtime restaurant with a smile.  </p>

		<p>To me this is just another &#8220;public service&#8221; message as to the dangers of eating out. Instead of eating this &#8220;hip and eco-friendly&#8221; garbage prepare your own food. You&rsquo;ll save money, eat better, and have less of a chance of contracting a nasty disease.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. Restaurant owners hire illegals mainly because they want to pay minimum wage or below to the mestizos. It&rsquo;s not that they are hard working and loyal. It&rsquo;s because they are forced to &#8221; go the extra mile &#8221; to avoid exposure. I suspect that the owners of Chipotle Mexican Grill are making huge profits, have seen their stock go up 500%, and have expansion plans because they don&rsquo;t pay squat. They don&rsquo;t get my money, and they never will. Los hispanos trabajan aqui, Yo no compro aqui. That&rsquo;s my motto.</p>

		<p>I have a family member in management at Chipotle.  The managers of each restaurant are required to check papers when hiring, and are trained in identifying fake documents.  Some managers, however, hire illegals while winking and nodding at fake papers - these managers are all hispanics, of course.  Some restaurants even refuse to hire whites or non-Spanish speakers so their staff &#8220;gets along&#8221; (in Spanish).  Some even prefer to staff with people from their particular home country.</p>
<p>While some DC-area Chipotle locations will only lose one or two employees in the I-9 audit, others will lose most of their staff due to citizen-dodging hiring behavior.  It&rsquo;s a store-to-store situation.</p>
<p>My family member told me that due to the economy, Chipotle DC stores are currently receiving about 50 applications for each open position (paying about $8.50/hr).  White English speakers usually go to the bottom of the pile, along with college degree holders (who are presumed to want to leave immediately when the economy improves).  <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not a Mexican problem.  Nobody is flooding Mexico with millions of non-Mexicans and giving them affirmative action, free health, special privileges, and a free pass to commit crime!</p>
<p>The problem is White genocide  &mdash;   the displacement, subjugation, replacement, murder, rape, robbery, taxation, and miscegenation of ALL White people and ONLY White people in ALL White nations and ONLY White nations.</p>
<p>Wake up, White man!</p>
