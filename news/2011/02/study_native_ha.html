<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders may be at higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke at a younger age and more likely to have diabetes compared to other ethnicities, according to a study released today that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology&rsquo;s 63rd Annual Meeting in Honolulu April 9 to April 16, 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial differences in stroke risk factors have been well-studied in Hispanic and African-American populations, but this is the first study to address people of Native Hawaiian ethnicity,&#8221; said study author Kazuma Nakagawa, MD, with The Queen&rsquo;s Medical Center in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Data on 573 people hospitalized for intracerebral hemorrhage was taken from the &#8220;Get with the Guidelines-Stroke&#8221; database from The Queen&rsquo;s Medical Center over a period of six years. Of those, 18 percent were Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, 63 percent were Asian, 16 percent were Caucasian, 0.2 percent were African-American and three percent were described as other.</p>
<p>On average, Native Hawaiians who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke were around the age of 55, more than 10 years younger than those from other racial groups which had a combined average age of 67 when a stroke occurred. More Native Hawaiians also had diabetes; 35 percent compared to other racial groups at 21 percent. {snip}</p>

		<p>As Michael Savage would say - - &#8220;anytime you go into a Mc Donalds, and eat a dozen big Macs, a half dozen order of fries, and top the whole meal off with three milk shakes, and do it all at one sitting, you can expect some bad to happen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing more be said.</p>

		<p>Most Pacific Island nations are obese and have a shorter lifespan because of it. 37.5% of Native Hawaiians were classified as obese in 2002, higher than the national U.S. average of 32%.</p>
<p>The Native Hawaiian figure for overweight isn&rsquo;t given unfortunately but if weight fits into a bell curve then you will find the number of overweight (not obese) Native people are also higher than the U.S. national average of 64.5%.</p>

<p>In this case, make that a Big Kahuna burger and wash it down with Sprite.</p>

		<p>Go there. See and hear how these people feel and talk about their fellow Americans on the Mainland and you will wonder why we even consider these people to be worthy of our help or even friends. I have been there many times and the hate they show toward us Mainlanders is disgusting.</p>
<p>Hate = Stroke ?</p>

		<p>Diabetes and stroke?  These have &#8220;obesity&#8221; and &#8220;sedentary lifestyle written all over them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that the obesity rate in Hawaii, according to the CDC is the second lowest in the US (Colorado is the lowest) - but it&rsquo;s all the non-Polynesians there who skew the statistics.  Looking at other Pacific Island nations which have not been flooded with whites, Koreans, Japanese and Chinese, we see that eight of the top ten fattest countries in 2007 were Pacific Island nations:</p>
<p>1.  Nauru (94.5% overweight).<br>
2.  Micronesia (91.1% overweight).<br>
3.  Cook Islands (91.1% overweight).<br>
4.  Tonga (90.8% overweight).<br>
5.  Niue (81.7% overweight).<br>
6.  Samoa (80.4% overweight).<br>
7.  Palau (78.4% overweight).<br>
10. Kiribati (73.6% overweight).</p>
<p>In the Marshall Islands in 2008 there were 8,000 cases of adult-onset Type-2 diabetes out of a population of only 53,000.  In Fiji, doctors are now reporting that strokes are common in patients in their 20s and 30s.</p>
<p>I think part of this is a diet rich in Spam.  Polynesians are the heaviest consumers of this in the world, and it&rsquo;s full of fat and salt.  It&rsquo;s a post World War Two development; before then, islanders ate a high-fiber diet rich in fresh fish and locally-grown fruits and vegetables and got plenty of exercise paddling their fishing outriggers and casting nets.  They also weren&rsquo;t drinking sugary soft drinks as a dietary staple back then, either.<br>

		<p>With the beginning of agriculture there is a shift from the high protein diet of hunters to the high carbohydrate diet of those who get most of their calories from grains and beans. Over a period of many generations agricultural populations evolved in order to adjust to this shift.<br>
 <br>
Agriculture originated in the Near East among Caucasians ten thousand years ago. It spread to Europe eight thousand years ago. It originated independently in the Far East about eight thousand years ago. <br>
 <br>
Blacks, North American Indians, and Polynesians were introduced to agriculture much more recently. Each of these groups has health problems caused by a diet high in carbohydrates. <br>
 <br>
All of this, of course, disproves the newly created liberal dogma that race is nothing more than a social construct. The different races, and sub races within the races, have evolved in response to different population pressures lasting hundreds and thousands of years. They differ as much as sub species of various wild animal species, and breeds of domestic animals. <br>
 <br>
Each race contains some brilliant people, and many decent ones, although in different percentages. </p>
