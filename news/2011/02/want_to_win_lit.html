<h1><a href="https://englandcalling.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/want-to-win-literary-competions-pretend-youre-black/">Want To Win Literary Competitions? Pretend You&rsquo;re Black</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Henderson, England Calling (blog), February 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I am white. I wrote this story as an experiment to test the effect of political correctness on literary competitions. I did this by creating a story which both had a black theme and was written in a way which implied the author was black. However, the judges of the competition had no certain knowledge of my race or background. </p>
<p>Black was entered in the 1996 London writers completion. It came fourth. There were several thousand entries which meant that winning was something of a lottery and, consequently, the fact that my entry made it to the last four at my first attempt masquerading as black strongly suggested that the nature of the story had influenced its choice as one of the best out of thousands.</p>
<p>When I attended the award ceremony there was hilarious consternation when I went up to accept the prize because the judges had all assumed that the author of black was black. There was also a great rumble of amazement amongst the audience  &mdash;  I noted a solitary black face in the entire gathering.</p>
<p>Although I wrote the story for the purpose described and the dismayed look on the judges faces as I responded to my name being called was worth a tidy fortune, the story had other purposes. I wanted to explore the mentality of blacks towards their lives in England and just to complicate matters I distinguished the character further by making him highly intelligent. This allowed me to have him set apart from the mainstream black mentality which in turn enabled me to examine racial issues from an angle few blacks would have approached and to slaughter the holy cows of black victimhood.  Now for the story.<br>

		<p>Now <i>that</i> was a funny read!</p>
<p>With lines like this&hellip;</p>
<p><i>My ma&rsquo;s got a nice refined whitey type  face and my old man on a bad day looks like he&rsquo;s auditioning for King Kong.  Whose features have I got?  I&rsquo;ll give you one shafting guess.</i></p>
<p>&hellip; I can only imagine the look on the judge&rsquo;s face when he found out the author was white.</p>
<p>This is very similar to a case in 1996 when an Australian man, Leon Carmen, used as a pseudonym the name of an aboriginal woman, Wanda Koolmatrie, for his book <i>My Own Sweet Time</i>.  He won a Dobbie Award for the book, and it was something of a scandal when it was discovered that the author was a white man.  I myself see nothing wrong with whites doing what they can to take advantage of the pervasive affirmative action that exists within intellectual circles today.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from good sources that your college application to some schools is more likely to be accepted if you legally change your name to a heavily hispanic name before applying (in states where they can&rsquo;t check ethnicity under the law).  </p>
<p>If you change your name to Maria Delgado or Juan Rodriguez, your application will get a second look it wouldn&rsquo;t get under Susan Thompson or Steven Parker.  You might even find your financial aid package to be quite generous, and it&rsquo;s not like they can take the money back if you change your name back to your original name <i>after</i> being accepted.  If they even tried to revoke your acceptance due to a name change, you could sue them into the ground.  Either way, being &#8220;Jesus Martinez&#8221; for a year could be very lucrative!  <br>

<p>Mr. Casteel once told me that because his (and his daughter&rsquo;s) name sounds Hispanic, and actually is Hispanic if you sell it &#8220;Castillo,&#8221; and he is from Arkansas where Hispanics are a fast growing segment of the population, that his daughter, who had a great high school transcript, at first got oodles and bundles full of scholarship offers for college, that were immediately revoked once those responsible for administering the scholarship funds laid eyes on her, and saw that she wasn&rsquo;t Hispanic.</p>

		<p>Wow. Just wow.</p>
<p>Many of the things the author wrote here sound like the kind of hard truths I read here on AmRen! And to think this essay was awarded top honors in politically correct Britain! </p>
<p>I would love to have seen the looks on the faces of the judges and heard the gasps of the crowd when this white man walked up to claim his award. The only way this essay was given any consideration was because the judges thought he was black, since he wrote things no white man can ever get away with saying.</p>
<p>Hey, this gives me an idea! The next time AmRen wants to hold a conference, they should register with the hotel as a black civil rights organization!  Then they&rsquo;ll be assured of getting any hotel in any city they want!</p>

		<p>This is true activism in white interest.  It&rsquo;s almost like a lightbulb went off in my head.  What an ingenious stunt to pull to illustrate the double standards liberal elites have.  I honestly feel inspired from this act.  This is the model of civil disobedience we need to be following.</p>

		<p> This has to be one of the most remarkable stream-of-consciousness pieces I&rsquo;ve ever read.</p>
<p> I won&rsquo;t try to parse all the content of it, but I&rsquo;ll say three things. One, Mr. Henderson is indeed a very intelligent man, because only an intelligent man could have packed so many insights that appear to me (as an American not overly familiar with Britain) to be spot on. Two, I can see where the judges were fooled, as it sounds for all the world as if it were written by just who Henderson said the writer was: An intelligent black man, living in an alien (to him) land, frustrated by both his &#8220;own&#8221; people and &#8220;Whitey.&#8221; And, three, as I&rsquo;ve read a smattering here and there of writings by black Americans (which are usually over-rated by White liberal critics), I&rsquo;d say that Mr. Henderson perused a number of them to get that particular mix of African literary rhythm; frustration; and cynicism that his piece contains.</p>
<p> Congratulations, Mr. Henderson! A capital trick you played on those judges. I&rsquo;d love to have seen their faces when you came forward, in all your Whiteness, to claim your award. </p>

		<p>The comedian Steve Allen did something similar in the &rsquo;50s.</p>
<p>Tired of the critics slamming his instrumental jazz albums, Allen released an LP of his own compositions under the name of his black maid. The album cover showed her sitting by Allen&rsquo;s piano.</p>
<p>Of course the liberal critics swooned and fell over themselves praising this brilliant, visionary new artist. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s one of the funniest things I&rsquo;ve ever read!  Even more so when I started reading the essay itself; a white man would be prosecuted for &#8220;hate speech&#8221; for writing such things and he got away with it only because they thought he was black.</p>

		<p>Trevor Phillips is chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality in Britain. He is Black. Practically anything to do with race or &#8216;equality&rsquo; is run by a non-White, that&rsquo;s why they are appointed, and, in any case, it&rsquo;s a fire-proof job as any criticism (by Whites) is construed as &#8216;racist&rsquo;. This story is brilliant in several ways, not least because no real black in Britain could, or would, have written it and I&rsquo;m quite surprised that the judging panel didn&rsquo;t twig this as being facetious is a well developed amusement in White England. I doubt if Trevor Phillips has read the story but I bet he would be livid that there is very little he can do about it except for some of the phrases used. These can, and are, constantly used by blacks but it is actually illegal for a White to utter them or write them down. This is called &#8216;racial equality&rsquo; and why they were accepted as genuine in this story. It&rsquo;s also why non-White children routinely stab one another in the stairwells of London housing blocks, they too believe in racial equality but not between somalis or west indians or west africans or afghans or citizens from the myriad of other hell-holes we give &#8216;refuge&rsquo; to.<br>
Robert Henderson should replace Trevor Phillips immediately as he obviously has a better understanding of blacks.</p>

		<p>There was a book out that was all the rage on campus during the 1990&rsquo;s called &#8220;I, Rigoberta Menchu&#8221;. Inside were the &#8216;revolutionary&rsquo; words of a Guatemalan woman who &#8216;orally told&rsquo; her story to an English speaking anthropologist. When it turned out it was impossible for some of the content to be true, instead of the work being completely discredited, the leftists promoting it claimed it was a hodgepodge of information and the author was speaking for &#8216;all women in Guatemala&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I earned my Ph.D. in art history at an Ivy League university in the early 90s.</p>
<p>As you might know, there are still virtually no blacks or Hispanics in the humanities at top universities in the US (after 40 years of aggressive affirmative action, blacks are about 1% of the faculty in humanities fields at Harvard University). </p>
<p>One year, my department excepted a rather mediocre applicant from a Southern state with a black sounding name.</p>
<p>He turned out to be white, and that was the last anyone heard about inclusiveness in our department&hellip;</p>

		<p>There was a case where a conservative philosophy professor submitted a paper to a scholarly journal under a fictitious name. His paper was also fictitious and filled with nonsensical post-modern style gobbledygook. It was a minor scandal when the professor revealed the truth and in doing so exposed this scholarship as &#8216;fraud&rsquo;. If anyone can remember the profs name it would be helpful. </p>

		<p>I assume this was not a contest that accepted only autobiographical essays, so the author&rsquo;s fiction was perfectly acceptable.  Anyone who knows the truth about black/white relations would find his assertions to be preposterous, so anyone reading the entry should have suspected that it was fanciful.  Of course, the disingenuous white liberal judges probably DO feel toward blacks as the author imagines non-blacks to feel toward his fictional character.</p>

		<p>Reading this while already knowing the author is white likely tainted my perception.  Several times I felt the language was over the top as was his desire to play Richard the 3rd and Henry the 5th (of all things).<br>
 <br>
But I can also see how this must have seemed like a liberal wet dream as well.  I could feel all the triggers they would jump on.  However, I can also see how quickly they would tear it apart once they knew the truth (not that the author created a true deception, it was a work of fiction).  If I put on my SPLC goggles and read this I see all kinds of covert and overt &#8220;racism&#8221; and I would view this whole thing as a racist sham.<br>
 <br>
His take on rioting was spot on.  Since the LA riots didn&rsquo;t net enough white deaths, nobody in the nation was as concerned as they were simply fascinated in a gladiatorial kind of way.  If white families had been cornered in their homes and executed en masse,  we would have seen military intervention.<br>
 <br>
Japan learned a hard lesson about forcing whitey&rsquo;s hand.  The Japanese kicked our unprepared arses all over the Pacific till the American war machine got into full swing.  Their treachery was rewarded with fantastic advances in wholesale killing.  <br>
 <br>
This author reveals a good deal more with this work than we get from real blacks.  Real blacks rarely give this kind of honest assessment.  Even Cosby was protracted and used foolish examples like the Pound Cake bit.  So many of us want Sharpton or Jackson to stand up and say &#8220;OK brothers, it&rsquo;s time to clean house and get our children in order to save our future&#8221;.  Instead I hear &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to harass whitey and extort all we can get&#8221;.<br>
 <br>
American can survive without successful blacks, but who really wants that?  And why are blacks so willing to accept that?<br>

		<p>A while back there was a scandal that white people aspiring to be news anchors were changing their surnames to Hispanic-sounding names in order to get hired, and it was working.  Of course the outcry was that these evil whities were taking jobs that rightfully &#8220;belonged&#8221; to Hispanics.  It didn&rsquo;t seem to occur to anyone that the whites were being discriminated against in the first place, and that&rsquo;s why they were driven to change their names, and that they couldn&rsquo;t get hired until they did so. </p>
<p>The fact is, being black or Hispanic is such a great advantage in this country now, and being white is such a disadvantage, that we will only see more such cases.</p>

		<p>I admit that this was brilliant and one of the ways that Jared Taylor must have been referring to in his column earlier this week.  This sort of activism will likely be punished as it breaks out.  Never-the-less, it ought to be done because the anti-whiteness of even white people is incredible.  Once faced with their own raging self-hatred and racism, it must give them some pause.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s the opposite way to go about this, to make such a protest. Simply present a paper already done by a respected and lauded minority activist, except with one change. Substitute the word &#8216;black&rsquo; with &#8216;white&rsquo; and the word &#8216;white&rsquo; with &#8216;black&rsquo; in each place on the essay, then turn your paper in and await your prize. It might be wise to have your own actual work filed away or sealed and notarized for safekeeping.</p>

		<p>Yeah there is something to that Hispanic name thing at least until the late &rsquo;90s in Arizona.  I worked a woman who was of Irish extraction that had married, then divorced a hispanic man. However, she kept the hispanic surname &amp; reaped the affirmative action benefits at ASU, and was promoted well in advance of her peers at a Federal Gov&rsquo;t agency. Being black or having a hispanic surname is definitely an asset in tough economic times.</p>

<p>- You should do this. Also, join some ethnic clubs (don&rsquo;t have to bother with anything more than minimally necessary attendance, etc) to &#8220;spice&#8221; up your resume (they can&rsquo;t legally keep you out if they are receiving government funding (ie- school money). If enough whites started doing things like this to screw with the diversipods, they would throw a major monkeywrench in the process. More whites than minorities would get on the slots they wanted to reserve for minorities (because the playing field would be leveled, and whites would be more likely to be competitive with higher academic qualifications). They would be forced to start using increasingly more direct race based admissions, all of which is illegal. </p>

		<p>Glad the story amused people. It has its funny side,  but the fact that it did not result in the usual pc-driven hue and cry carries a serious general message, namely, that the politically correct only succeed because people play the game by their rules,  which means making Maoist-style apologies and accepting the veracity of the ideology. </p>
<p>I discovered long ago that latter day liberals will wilt if faced with people who refuse to play their game. Just stand up and say equality is meaningless except in limited contexts such as the law and  discrimination is the natural order of things because no organism let alone a man can survive without discriminating dozens of times a day (normal people call it making choices) and you will find the politically correct cannot handle the resistance.  </p>
<p>Here is a  link to an  article I wrote for Right Now! some years ago on the character of modern liberals, who are not liberal but the most fearful bigots. Hence, the title.  </p>
