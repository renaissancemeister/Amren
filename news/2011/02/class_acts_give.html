			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Goodwin, New York Post, February 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Here we go again. In a winter ritual as familiar as snow, the results of specialized high-school admissions are sparking the usual hand-wringing and finger-pointing about a shortage of &#8220;minorities&#8221; and a lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; at the best city schools.</p>
<p>With the announcement that black eighth-graders make up only 5 percent of students accepted to eight specialized schools next year and Hispanic students only 6 percent, fevered accusations run the range from prejudice to prejudice. New Yorkers once again are being lectured by the media and others that the results prove the deck is stacked in favor of the privileged, which is another way of saying &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The professional pot-stirrers can reach their conclusions only by dismissing the incredible phenomenon of Asian success. Last time I looked, Asians are nonwhite minorities, too, yet they are the superstars of New York education.</p>
<p>Many are also immigrants who come from poor families who do not speak English. All of which means city educrats should be celebrating their achievements and trying to duplicate them among other students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Though they represent only 15 percent of city students, Asian students, including those from China, Korea, India and Pakistan, already account for upwards of 60 percent of the population at top high schools, such as Stuyvesant and Bronx Science. The pattern continues with the latest test results.</p>
<p>Asians were 26 percent of the 28,211 students who qualified to take the 2011 competitive high-schools exam, but were 47 percent of those scoring well enough to get accepted.</p>
<p>Non-Hispanic whites were 15 percent of test takers, and 23 percent of those accepted. Blacks were 23 percent of test takers, and 5 percent of those accepted. Hispanics were 21 percent of test takers and 6 percent of those accepted.</p>
<p>The numbers are incomplete because the city doesn&rsquo;t know the race and ethnicity of 18 percent of those accepted.</p>
<p>Still, we know enough to say there is a double standard when it comes to the reaction. In a more honest world, Asian success would be hailed as proof the American dream still lives. But to do so would be to demolish the &#8220;white privilege&#8221; argument, and so their success is an inconvenient fact to be ignored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[The] Asian experience in New York schools mirrors what is happening in many top colleges across the nation. {snip}</p>
<p>Make no mistake  &mdash;  the lopsided results show that too many black and Hispanic students are lagging their classmates. The consequences for the city could be dire because Hispanics, of different nationalities, now make up 40 percent of all students, and blacks 30 percent.</p>
<p>But lagging students of any racial group won&rsquo;t be helped if we pretend their failure makes them victims of an unfair system. We should instead embrace the Asian educational miracle as an enduring testament to the merit of competition and the need to keep raising the bar for all students. After all, if they can overcome their many obstacles to make it here, why can&rsquo;t others?</p>

		<p>Whites don&rsquo;t have any privilege.  </p>
<p>Privilege is being left along to pursue life, liberty, property, and happines; privilege is often miscalled rights.</p>
<p>Whites are not left alone. Whites are targeted for dispossession at best and outright genocide at worst, but expected.</p>
<p>Whites have no privilege, other than to privately scheme over how to make sure the traitor elites are on the receiving end of the Diversity Treatment when it becomes its true self- the Diversity Curse.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, if [Asians] can overcome their many obstacles to make it here, why can&rsquo;t others?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Because Asians, like whites, have good brains. Blacks and browns don&rsquo;t have good brains. That&rsquo;s why. I could go into more detail, but basically, that&rsquo;s the explanation the reporter looking for here. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to be a downer on an article like this. It&rsquo;s certainly better than most of the counterfactual tripe. It gets things about half right: YES, whites and Asians do WAY better in our schools than our minorities; NO that&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s ever going to change. Not &#8220;an obstacle that can be overcome.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This article ignores the other successful minority group: Jews.</p>
<p>After WWII, Jews flooded NYC   &mdash;   many orphaned, penniless, not speaking English, uneducated (b/c they were in concentration camps), etc.  Amazingly, these displaced European Jews filled NY universities and colleges and went on to become one of the most successful groups in America   &mdash;   despite no food stamps, no Section-8 housing, no-Head Start, no Affirmative Action, etc., and despite considerable prejudice against them. </p>
<p>The following line from the above article hides this fact: &#8220;Non-Hispanic whites were 15 percent of test takers, and 23 percent of those accepted&#8221; In reality, Jews probably represent 1/3 of the &#8220;White&#8221; test takers, and 15% of those accepted.  Hence, European-Americans are probably accepted at close to their population percentage.  The problem for NYC Blacks and Hispanics isn&rsquo;t European-Americans, it is Asians and Jews.  Same at some coastal universities, where Asians and to a lesser extent Jews comprise most of the student body.  But, of course the liberal media would never say that.      </p>

		<p>Well I haven&rsquo;t lived in Asian countries, but I practiced or immersed myself in many parts of Asian culture. There is much complexity to these people and they tend to practice with lots discipline.</p>
<p>While Japan and China are being &#8220;Americanized&#8221; to huge degree, Asians families do tend to be very strict, tends to place values in honor, and a dedication to skill. They tend to wear uniform in their schools. They tend not to have &#8220;extracurricular classes.&#8221; </p>
<p>They simply don&rsquo;t screw around when it comes to school. Something I couldn&rsquo;t find amongst African Americans even given a time of day.</p>
<p>I do also believe this stems from average IQ score that is higher among Asian peoples. Printing 220 A.D., rockets in 282 A.D., gunpowder 1044 A.D., Papermaking 105 A.D., Compass 1044 A.D., etc. These inventions don&rsquo;t dictate automatically dictate intelligence but rather give us an idea of what these people are made of.</p>

<p>This is the old chicken or the egg debate. The old nature vs nuture debate which I think is stupid, because nurture arises out of nature.</p>

		<p>100 % right.</p>
<p>It surprises many folks that the richest group in America that can be identified as a group are the Chinese?</p>
<p>The second richest group are the Hindu from India.</p>
<p>And then comes the richest white group - - Jews. But Jews behind both Chinese and Indian Hindu.</p>
<p>And the rest of the whites are further down the pack. In some cases, much further down the pack. Tell me what all this says? Whitey cannot be that bad? Whites rather sets the conditions that allow others to prosper!</p>

<p>Or, in different words:</p>
<p>&#8220;The professors [Arthur Sakamoto of the University of Texas and two colleagues] note that the success of the Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans [across a range of indices: educational attainment, average income, etc.] violates the majority-minority paradigm, which posits that minorities have &#8216;lower socioeconomic characteristics because whites exploit minorities by maintaining racial and ethnic discrimination in society.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

		<p> There are two basic reasons overall for the marked success of students from Asia   &mdash;   especially from East Asia: One is the Confucian Ethic; the other is high IQs.</p>
<p> Chinese, Japanese and Korean people are still influenced by the ethic of the great Chinese philosopher Confucius, which taught in part that people should honor their parents and those in authority; and that they should work hard and strive to succeed. Combined with the high average IQs among Asians from that area   &mdash;   second in the world only to the average for Ashkanazi Jews   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s not hard to see why they succeed. The IQs give them the brainpower; the Confucian ethic encourages an inner drive.</p>
<p> Blacks and Hispanics seem to have, on average, little of any such drive, and their average IQs are certainly far below those of the East Asians. But as the writer says, of course to acknowledge all that would be to sound the death knell for the &#8220;White privilege&#8221; argument.</p>
<p> We have encouraged those groups already prone to sloth, to be even more slothful, and to believe that someone&rsquo;s foot is on their heads, holding them down. The Asians, as a group, don&rsquo;t believe that anyone &#8220;owes them&#8221; anything, and so they rise to the top by their determination to succeed.</p>

		<p>How dreadful!  Now Asians are conspiring against blacks, keeping them in economic and intellectual bondage. And in the midst of all this they stay married and indoctrinate their children with strong family values, to include hard work, fidelity, and self-discipline.</p>
<p>Such treachery should be punished by any means necessary!</p>

		<p>I guess the question is rhetorical but the answer is that the black IQs are 15-20 points lower and that isn&rsquo;t going to change.  Do you think genes might play a role?  Oh heck, I think you know the answer.</p>

		<p>This is the big elephant in the room, and I can tell you that here in NYC every teacher I know yearns, I mean YEARNS, to be put in a school with a lot of east asian kids.  That&rsquo;s such an easy gig and of course the all powerful &#8216;test scores&rsquo; (or data) will show you to be a &#8216;Master&rsquo; teacher.  (Translation: your job is safe.)</p>
<p>However, most of us get stuck in schools with &#8216;students&rsquo; who do NOT study all night, hang on your every word, sit quietly and obediently and try to outdo each other in getting the top grades.  Oh it&rsquo;s quite the opposite, let me assure you.</p>
<p>The worst are the black schools, which are not unlike war zones.  Even the most dedicated, skilled teacher runs a high risk of being &#8216;shown&rsquo; to be a &#8216;failure&rsquo; because the (predictable) low test scores (the data) &#8216;proves&rsquo; it.</p>
<p>In the crazy world here, if you teach latino students who have both language problems and are 3-6 grade levels behind what a born-and-raised American student should be, given the age, the risks are even higher.  Mix both blacks and latinos together with a heavy dose of developmentally disabled students (special ed in the old days) and you wonder why 50% of all teachers are gone in 5 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in two of the specialized high schools in NYC.  Asians are over-represented and white kids are truly a minority.  I guess that&rsquo;s not &#8216;diverse&rsquo; enough for the race hustlers, who treat asians as if they were invisible. </p>

<p>According to the current statistics, the wealthiest Asian group are not Chinese Americans but Indian Americans. Indian Americans are the per capita wealthiest ethnic group followed closely by the Japanese Americans and Jewish Americans.</p>

<p>I agree that Asians have slightly higher IQs than whites and I agree that they are more disciplined.  They should be applauded for this.  But listing their past inventions is a bad way of demonstrating their intellect, or &#8220;what they are made of&#8221; as you say&hellip;..especially if you are comparing them to whites, because I hate to tell you, but in that department, they lose. </p>

<p>I hope most people on here with sense are disturbed by this as opposed to giddy about it. I don&rsquo;t care how smart particular immigrant groups are.  They shouldn&rsquo;t be here competing with our own kids over our resources.  America did just fine without Asians.  Where were they when we were sending men to the moon or splitting the atom?  The Asians are good at making Asian countries successful (with the help of white technology), and white people are best suited for making Western Civilization what it is.  No other race can do it the same as we can, nor should they be allowed to.<br>

		<p>I taught in a SoCA barrio area, and when Asian kids came into our school, teachers would FIGHT to get them in their classes.  The reason?  Even Asian kids who spoke NO English - any grade level - would be English-fluent in a year or less.  They are phenomenal.  Mexican kids often aren&rsquo;t fluent by 12th grade, even if they&rsquo;ve been in English-speaking schools since they were 6.  Blacks seem to have a law against speaking proper English, so they aren&rsquo;t any help.  Why is this important?  Because of the Holy Grail of the State Tests, taken in April and May - those tests determine, by the students&rsquo; performance, the status of each individual teacher, AND how much Federal money each school gets.  So yeah, the Asian students are super desirable - they learn, they work hard, and in general are dream students.  They even make the few white students in public schools look stupid in comparison.  White privilege is nonsense - it&rsquo;s parents putting a priority on education and on learning English - AND parents instilling strict behavioral standards in their homes.  Those of us in education know this all too well.  Black and Hispanic parents deny it - but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, as they say - and black and Hispanic pudding is far inferior to Asian and white puddings.</p>

		<p>Obviously, the answer to the lower IQs of the Afrins and Mestits is breeding with Asians.  Therefore, it should be mandatory for Asians in the US to mate only with blacks and browns until there is an average IQ of 90+.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Wang, get out there and start looking for Miss BootyCall.  And, Yo, Yo, Yo, Rappers, you beez needin&rsquo; Miss Changity-Chang!</p>
<p>Of course, sterilization of sub-90 IQ holders makes too much sense, I guess.</p>

<p>Others are trying to claim credit for White inventions, innovations and creations I&rsquo;m sick of it and it&rsquo;s time we put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what we Whites are made of:  </p>
<p><i>Over 97% of the most important scientists and 74% of the most important artists and authors were white, almost all males, and most from only four countries, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy with borders defined by Naples, Marseilles, the western border of Dorset County in England, a point a few miles above Glasgow, the northern tip of Denmark, and a point a few miles east of the city that used to be Breslau in German Silesia (now Wroclaw in Poland).</i></p>
<p>See map here:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6y4orag" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/6y4orag</a></p>
<p>Ben:  </p>
<p>It <i>frosts</i> me that White creations and inventions are being assigned to non-Whites.  I know this because I see it in school textbooks every single day and it infuriates me.  </p>
<p>Paper:  </p>
<p><i>Often the allegation is heard that paper was invented in China or Egypt. In neither of these two civilizations was paper used: in China a textile based parchment was used</i></p>
<p><i>Only in 1840, was the process of producing paper from ground wood developed in Europe, and the idea of adding chemicals only took place in 1850, creating the modern paper making process which has lasted to this day.</i></p>
<p>Printing:  </p>
<p><i>As with paper, the allegation is often heard that printing was invented in China. This is also untrue: in China a simple system of pattern inking had been developed in which a strip of material was lain against a water based painted picture.</i></p>
<p><i>In Europe, printing was developed entirely independently after long thought on how to speed up the process of book copying: Johann Gutenberg, of the German city of Mainz, invented the technical aspects of printing in 1450&hellip;The invention of the printing press revolutionized the spread of knowledge</i></p>
<p>Gunpowder and Guns:  </p>
<p><i>The Chinese had what they called &#8216;fire powder&rsquo; - an inflammable chemical which they used in bamboo tubes to make clay pellet firing &#8216;rockets.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>A 14th Century German monk, Berthold Schwarz, was the first person to use gunpowder to fire a substantial projectile, and can rightly be given the title of inventor of the firearm&hellip;Gunpowder factories had been established in England and Germany in 1334 and 1340 respectively.</i></p>
<p>Rocketry:</p>
<p><i>The American scientist, Dr. Robert H. Goddard, is considered to be the father of practical modern rocketry. His experiments with solid and liquid fueled rockets formed much of the basis of the development of ballistic missiles, earth-orbiting satellites, and interplanetary exploration.</i></p>
<p>We must stop others from laying claim to our achievements.  It&rsquo;s bad enough our highly intelligent White children are being stifled educationally.</p>

		<p>Living in a mostly Chinese and Korean section of Queens, it&rsquo;s interesting to see how many after school learning academies there are to bolster S.A.T. scores, and how many Asian students are actually studying hard at the local library as well. </p>
<p>About three subway stations away, near Citi Field where the Mets play, one enters a Hispanic section. Needless to say, there are no examples to find to show a drive and determination to succeed in school by the students there. While I haven&rsquo;t spent any time in the mostly black area of Jamaica, Queens, I doubt that is any different in terms of students &#8220;hitting the books&#8221; after school.</p>
<p>How much of this is due to culture and how much to I.Q.? Most of those who post here know that average I.Q. differences among ethnic groups are the bigger part of the equation, and I believe there are more and more &#8220;closet questioners&#8221; of the dogma regarding equality of I.Q. averages, especially among liberal teachers from good colleges and universities who are forced to test out their idealism in various mostly black and Hispanic schools in the New York public school system.</p>

		<p>The blacks hate the successes of other minorities, because Whites recognize Asian and Jewish achievement as a symbol of black afrovoodoo incapacity for success.</p>
<p>Whites can always point to the successes and ask blacks why they didn&rsquo;t stay in school, work hard, avoid violent crime, especially when they had such good &#8220;role models&#8221; as the Asians/Jews to show them how to fight against Whitey and win.</p>
<p>The blacks will complain about the &#8220;painful scars of slavery and stigmatization of segregation,&#8221; but when they are playing on Whitey&rsquo;s feminized compassionate Christianity, we notice that they aren&rsquo;t asking us to help them get back home to Africa so the scars can heal and segregation&rsquo;s stigma will be wiped out.</p>
<p>Until afrovoodoos make their demands in context of getting back home to get justice from their black cousins who sold them to the Europeans, then we just can&rsquo;t take them seriously about anything, or allow them a moral cause.</p>

No one but a huckster for Charles Atlas pretends that it is possible to take a sickly, fifteen year old 97 pound weakling, and turn him into an award winning athlete. Nevertheless, liberals continue to pretend that any reasonably competent public school teacher should be able to take an illegitimate black boy with an IQ of 70 and serious discipline problems, and turn him into a high achievement professional. <br>
 <br>
No Child Left Behind is making teachers even less willing than before to teach in inner city schools, because it imposes standards that are impossible to reach.  </p>

In the crazy world here, if you teach latino students who have both language problems and are 3-6 grade levels behind what a born-and-raised American student should be, given the age, the risks are even higher. Mix both blacks and latinos together with a heavy dose of developmentally disabled students (special ed in the old days) and you wonder why 50% of all teachers are gone in 5 years.<br>

If you can document working conditions for teachers in schools with mainly black and Hispanic students with links to credible sources, please send me an e-mail. I am confident that your assertions are honest and accurate, but I would like to be able to prove that they are true. <br>
 <br>
How dangerous are those schools? What percentage of teachers drop out, as opposed to the percentage of teachers who teach whites and East Asians? <br>

		<p>It is not in the nature of blacks, mestizos, and mulattoes to &#8220;embrace the Asian model&#8221;. (Northeast) Asians tend to be more successful in school and become wealthier than whites and other races because they tend, on average, to have more innate intelligence as measured by IQ. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why it is that Asian cultures have tended to be stagnant relative to European cultures. Maybe this reflects some aspect of intelligence or personality that does not necessarily increase individual success, but which is important to creating a successful and dynamic culture. However, it does seem that, given that two individuals live in the same society, the NE Asian is likely to be slightly more successful academically and economically than the white. The effects of their high IQs may be increased by cultural factors (the value they place on education and hard work and such), but the assumption that blacks and Hispanics (or even whites, for that matter) can be made equally successful by embracing Asian culture is an ascientific fantasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marcus Garvey replaces MLK!&#8221;<br>
Not going to happen. Blacks may complain about the &#8220;scars of slavery&#8221;, but if you ask any one of them if they would rather live in Africa or the US, only the most dishonest or most ignorant will say they&rsquo;d rather live in Africa. Garvey at least had the consistency to argue that blacks should return to Africa if they were unhappy in America. That consistency is lacking in 99.9% of blacks today.</p>
<p>Asians are hardly the model minority, though. Wherever they are the majority, they routinely discriminate against whites and rig the system to exaggerate their own advantages. Make no mistake, in a multi-racial country, they would gladly shaft whites to improve their own position, and they have the means to do it without white co-conspirators, unlike the blacks and nonwhite Hispanics, who generally need white or nearly white leaders to effectively take over, even when they are the majority. For that reason, I would say that Asian immigration, while it accounts for a minority of nonwhite immigration and doesn&rsquo;t create as fast-breeding a population, is probably more of a threat to the long-term survival of whites in this country than Hispanic or African immigration.</p>

		<p><i>Meanwhile people continue to pretend that The Bell Curve has been &ldquo;decisively refuted.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>This is one more case of liberal ideology trumping reality. </p>
<p>Let me raise a point:  what would be the implications of the findings of The Bell Curve becoming a basis for educational policy?  Would the groups which are at the bottom end of the IQ curve be willing to accept the results?   </p>
<p>This might mean having a multi-tier education system in which students are grouped for IQ, taught differently, and end up in different vocations/careers. I&rsquo;m kinda thinking of the system Huxley had in &#8220;Brave New World&#8221; with genetically engineered castes.</p>
<p>This might be the rational outcome.</p>
<p>But I suspect if the truth were to be told about IQ, the result would be massive social upheaval. Perhaps something on the level of the long hot summers of the 1960s. Perhaps educators understand this, and are using the ideology of liberal egalitarianism as a means to keep the lid on.</p>
<p>To give but one example: what if you were a high school teacher in the inner city? Could you stand in front of a classroom and tell your charges that the Asians are going to get ahead because of higher median Q, while blacks will fail in large numbers owing to lower median IQ?</p>
<p>Imagine the ruckus that would cause!</p>
<p>Of course, this situation can not go on forever.  </p>
<p>There needs to be a major rethinking of race, IQ, education, immigration, and the future of America and the West. While we still have time. </p>

From the above article:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;The applicants who were hurt the most by the affirmative-action admission policies were Asian students, who had to earn 140 points more than the typical middle-class, white applicant to gain admission&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How Diversity Punishes Asians, Poor Whites and Lots of Others&#8221;<br>
http://tinyurl.com/34wpfpq<br>
From this article:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;The box students checked off on the racial question on their application was thus shown to have an extraordinary effect on a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the highly competitive private schools in the NSCE database. To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550. Here the Espenshade/Radford results are consistent with other studies, including those of William Bowen and Derek Bok in their book The Shape of the River, though they go beyond this influential study in showing both the substantial Hispanic admissions advantage and the huge admissions penalty suffered by Asian applicants. Although all highly competitive colleges and universities will deny that they have racial quotas   &mdash;   either minimum quotas or ceiling quotas   &mdash;   the huge boosts they give to the lower-achieving black and Hispanic applicants, and the admissions penalties they extract from their higher-achieving Asian applicants, clearly suggest otherwise&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Confession: The most important question I have ever answered in my life so far was the one regarding race on my university application.  I cannot begin to tell you the extreme level of temptation to mark the &#8220;White&#8221; box; instead, I equivocated, marked &#8220;Other,&#8221; and wrote nothing in the space provided beside the &#8220;Other&#8221; box.</p>
<p>As for the rest, it was just a simple matter of routine.</p>
<p>(Side note: the university later telephoned me and conducted an interview.  I had already received my letter of acceptance, so I was not too worried about being disqualified.  The caller was polite and congenial.  The caller seemed more concerned that I may have had any unanswered questions.  The caller was quite skillful in making me talk and ask questions.  The call was short in duration (15 to 20 minutes).  Since nothing bad happened afterward, I surmised that, overall, I passed the entrance &#8220;exam.&#8221;)</p>

The main problem is the do-gooders need to fix something that is not broken. The other races survived in their environment because of natural selection. Now the whites transpose them into another environment that allows them to multiply exponentially and push out the white race. The same thing is happening in nature with the Kudzu plant in Georgia and the Chinese Mitten Crab in North America (USA). No other race on this planet that I can think of will benefit another race more than its own except for stupid whites. </p>

		<p>The number of whites are probably slightly under their proportions due to various AA schemes. Also, a lot of Jews live in NYC and have disproportionately high IQs, which skewers the difference even more.</p>
<p>But even so, it&rsquo;s very easy for people to feel good about themselves for being white and bashing blacks but the fact is that I&rsquo;ve read a curious statistic on many places that Asians(Indians and NE Asians are in the focus) work around 3 times as much as white students.</p>
<p>The average IQ of China is 100, not 105(most of those early tests were taken in places like Shanghai which is not comparable to the country at large).</p>
<p>The average IQ in Germany is around 102. Some place it at 106. In Sweden it&rsquo;s around 103, but has dropped significantly because of mass immigration.</p>
<p>We also know that IQ can be improved by food and the kind of intellectual activity you do. And you can improve it relatively rapidly, but of course, it wanes if you stop doing the good stuff.</p>
<p>My simple conclusion is that Whites are not just doing well enough. Yes, we can complain about AA and so forth - and rightly so - but most young Euro-Americans are not just hard workers.</p>
<p>I think the disproportionate success of Asians is in large part due to their superior work ethic.</p>
<p>As for the IQ differences, it depends what data you look on. If there&rsquo;s a difference, it&rsquo;s probably no more than 2-3 points.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re working 3 times more, it will show. IQ is just like talent, having it is not enough. If you don&rsquo;t practice and nurture your natural talent it will wither and be wasted. <br>
That&rsquo;s where many Euro-Americans are right now. Without ambition or drive. </p>
<p>A case in point is the Californian abolishment of AA where Asians increased despite no AA. We have to compare ourselves to the best and strive to be number 1 as we once were, when the protestant work ethic and calvinism was everywhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never lose to blacks or hispanics no matter how lazy we become, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so convenient for many to always point at them, conveniently forgetting the staggering success of Asians. </p>

<p>&#8220;This article ignores the other successful minority group: Jews.</p>
<p>After WWII, Jews flooded NYC  &mdash;  many orphaned, penniless, not speaking English, uneducated (b/c they were in concentration camps), etc. Amazingly, these displaced European Jews filled NY universities and colleges and went on to become one of the most successful groups in America  &mdash;  despite no food stamps, no Section-8 housing, no-Head Start, no Affirmative Action, etc., and despite considerable prejudice against them.</p>
<p>The following line from the above article hides this fact: &ldquo;Non-Hispanic whites were 15 percent of test takers, and 23 percent of those accepted&rdquo; In reality, Jews probably represent 1/3 of the &ldquo;White&rdquo; test takers, and 15% of those accepted. Hence, European-Americans are probably accepted at close to their population percentage. The problem for NYC Blacks and Hispanics isn&rsquo;t European-Americans, it is Asians and Jews. Same at some coastal universities, where Asians and to a lesser extent Jews comprise most of the student body. But, of course the liberal media would never say that. &#8220;</p>
<p>Just one cravat to develop here.  Jewish is a religion.  Jews have lived in Europe for nearly 2,000 years, longer than Christians in many cases, as they supplied the Roman Army as merchants all the way to Britain before the advent of Christianity.  We know that early settlers melded with local populations genetically, but retained their religion due to higher tolerance until the 14th century when a hysterical population was encourage by the Church to blame Jews for well poisoning.  This was the start of the modern anti-Jewish history in Europe. </p>
<p>There is no country in the world named Jewland. Israel is not a theocracy, but a democracy and there are many non-Jews living peacefully in Israel. Jews come in many races, including black and Chinese, since Hebrews settled in both Africa and the Far East, and they show local assimilation genetically also, although not always retaining the religion as in Spain, where many forced Christian converts were known as Crypto-Jews.  How this Jew as race thing keeps going on when we are supposed to be so intelligent, high IQ, etc., can only be due to ignorance of the 14th century type.  Many European whites (Western) have been shown to have a Genghis Khan marker as well.</p>

		<p>Wow a lot of flame direct at me.</p>
<p>@ Courtney from Alabama</p>
<p>I agree that Asians have slightly higher IQs than whites and I agree that they are more disciplined. They should be applauded for this. But listing their past inventions is a bad way of demonstrating their intellect, or &ldquo;what they are made of&rdquo; as you say&hellip;..especially if you are comparing them to whites, because I hate to tell you, but in that department, they lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stated that &#8220;these inventions don&rsquo;t dictate automatically dictate intelligence but rather give us an idea of what these people are made of&#8221;  &mdash;  meaning it gives us a general idea&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope most people on here with sense are disturbed by this as opposed to giddy about it. I don&rsquo;t care how smart particular immigrant groups are. They shouldn&rsquo;t be here competing with our own kids over our resources. America did just fine without Asians. Where were they when we were sending men to the moon or splitting the atom? The Asians are good at making Asian countries successful (with the help of white technology), and white people are best suited for making Western Civilization what it is. No other race can do it the same as we can, nor should they be allowed to.&#8221;</p>
<p>You SHOULD care. This actually, as the article states, works in our favor. Liberals always assert that the outcome of whites being on top because of some sublime institutionalized racism that keeps others down. This argument gets destroyed when it comes to Asians. Asians are competing whether they live in the U.S. or not China is going to be the next superpower. Now you could say that you don&rsquo;t want Asians within a white country to out compete against whites; that is understandable.</p>
<p>One of the biggest accusations that gets pointed is that whites, under white nationalism, think themselves as superior. This is because many take the pride of racial group too far and live on the coast of earlier achievements. I often hear from opponents if whites are so great, why are they dying off? Why are the allowing themselves to be destroyed. Why does white nationalism need to exist? These counter arguments exist and for good reason. To remind us that we are not invincible nor superior as a group. </p>
<p>I, like Jared Taylor, try to go on facts. Different groups of people have different advantages and disadvantages. I think it is folly to go on just pride, especially that of a racial group alone. </p>
<p>There is NO weakness from admiring or learning about different cultures and what they have contributed as a while. In this light, I can see it from progressive&rsquo;s point of view. </p>
<p>At the same time it is also wrong to ignore accomplishments/history from a said group  &mdash;  with not pride a group becomes apathetic (bad). And also to believe in a egalitarian orthodoxy when science points otherwise which is recent thinking. Progressivism without some sort of restraint (conservatism) with critical thinking can lead to a radical change and death of a nation because many changes doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean good change.</p>
<p>But make no mistake a group (or race) that reminiscent, with extreme pride, about past accomplishments of a said group without the willingness to see progress and see the strengths in others is a nation that stagnates; and, all nations that stagnates tend to die. Environments change and extreme conservatism resist ALL forms of change  &mdash;  which isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>I believe in evolutionary approach which allows to for small beneficial changes and retaining past policies/etc that work. This is a hybrid approach.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m anti white or I want Asians to succeed more than whites (how you put it gleefully). All this means is that I see things as they are. I can admire other groups of people without feeling threatened. I can take other technologies and benefit whites while I don&rsquo;t destroy whites with extreme progressivism.</p>

<p>I disagree with you notion. Technology isn&rsquo;t a black and white dichotomy. It is a evolutionary process. Some person (within some group) discovered some tech., and that tech. find its way in trade and made its way to new nations. A new person thinks it is cool and builds upon top of said knowledge. However, it is true that inventions can be innovated entirely by separate nations without previous known knowledge from a another group. I do believe that this is rare.</p>
<p>As you can see there is a slow progression where technology slowly evolves.</p>
<p>What you state here clearly proves my point:</p>

His experiments with solid and liquid fueled rockets formed much of the basis of the development of ballistic missiles, earth-orbiting satellites, and interplanetary exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for the input. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t prove to be a threat to my people, white people, to acknowledged others and learn from others. What is a threat is when that said group has nothing to learn from others (hell the only way I learned that diversity wasn&rsquo;t all what it was cracked up to be was when I was in fact, ironically, in a diverse location).</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me additional insights into what whites, as a group, contributed to science and technology.</p>
<p>Take care from the Land of Babble. :)</p>

		<p>To poster #23, no teacher who is dependent on her job would ever document the working conditions while still under employment in the dept. of ed.  You&rsquo;d be fired in a hot minute.</p>
<p>There is a great book out there by someone who is NOT dependent as such entitled, &#8220;Bad Students Not Bad Schools.&#8221;  Look it up on Amazon.  That author provides tons of hard data along with some sorrowful teacher anecdotes.</p>
<p>The working conditions are truly awful.  I teach in a 100% latino school with black, indian and mestizo latinos.  As I tried to teach a lesson today (mind you all the kids like me because I&rsquo;m friendly and fair) these are some of the things I endured.</p>
<p>1. About 20% of the class paid attention and were good.<br>
2. About 40% of the class were talking amongst themselves with no regard for the fact that an adult, and a teacher, was before them, trying to help them learn something new.<br>
3.  10% of the students were asleep.<br>
4.  The remaining 30% were literally roaming around the classroom like caged animals.  (These are the gangbanger boys who cannot sit for more than 30 seconds without needing to pace about, huddle in the corner and whisper about drug deals, and then walk around bothering everybody else.)</p>
<p>As to point #4, about midway through my lesson, as it happened, school security came and took five of the gangbangers away to search them for drugs.  (There was some kind of tip or something.)  Near the last ten minutes of the period, they were all brought back and then proceeded to walk in and out of the room and all around as normal.</p>
<p>Was I trying to get them to sit down and do their work?  Of course.  Did I try every teacher trick in the book?  You bet.  The techniques work on 70% of the kids.  But the gangbangers are a world unto themselves.  They don&rsquo;t care if they pass your class.  </p>
<p>Actually, many of the non-gangsters also take a relaxed attitude and rarely do any classwork, let alone homework.  Homework?  Are you kidding!  All of us teachers lament that they just won&rsquo;t do it, across the board.</p>
<p>Do we call parents?  Most of the gangbangers no longer live in their homes (over age, kicked out, whatever.)  Other slackers - their parents often are divorced or have less than a fifth grade education themselves.  (Do you know how many pregnant students we have!)  </p>
<p>Do we try to get the administration involved with the lazy or trouble making students?  Yep, but nothing happens to them because all our admins are - you guessed it - latinos!  So they let them off and blame us for the problems.  I could go on, but you get the point.  20-30 percent of the kids are all right, but the other 70-80 percent are the death of a once proud nation. </p>

		<p>#23. That is why many new teachers that work in the Black and Hispanic schools come from Teach For America. These are top graduates of major universities that sign a two year contract to teach in these schools. They replace those teachers that leave these schools every year. Because of the economy, this program has had more applicants than they can handle.</p>

		<p>I heard on the radio recently a comment from a black professor who blames the failure of black students on the teachers and that the parents have nothing to do with those failures.  What I think is that a teacher is like a doctor.  They help you along but the cure comes from within the patient.  A student is taught and helped along by the teacher but it is up to the student to develop their skills and knowledge from hard work.  The teacher can only do so much.  It&rsquo;s amazing how blacks blame everyone but themselves when it comes to their shortcomings.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see, who invented Calculus, airplanes, space exploration, Physics, most of science, automobiles, modern medicine, computers etc&hellip;&hellip;?????? White people.</p>
<p>I agree that Asians have slightly higher IQs than whites and I agree that they are more disciplined. They should be applauded for this. But listing their past inventions is a bad way of demonstrating their intellect, or &ldquo;what they are made of&rdquo; as you say&hellip;..especially if you are comparing them to whites, because I hate to tell you, but in that department, they lose. </p>

The European level of achievement is simply off the charts in not only scientific advancement but in moral advancement. It was English folks in the late 1700s who first thought that there should be no slavery, that there should be individual rights. </p>

<p>I hope most people on here with sense are disturbed by this as opposed to giddy about it. I don&rsquo;t care how smart particular immigrant groups are. They shouldn&rsquo;t be here competing with our own kids over our resources. America did just fine without Asians. Where were they when we were sending men to the moon or splitting the atom? The Asians are good at making Asian countries successful (with the help of white technology), and white people are best suited for making Western Civilization what it is. No other race can do it the same as we can, nor should they be allowed to.</p>
<p><br>
I work near the most elite NYC public school. It is overwhelmingly Asian, and I don&rsquo;t begrudge these kids on a certain level-they are exceedingly well behaved for that age group, but white Ethnics are disturbingly missing. East Asians dominate, then S Asian and Jewish kids. We&rsquo;re giving away the store.<br>
Steve Sailer had an interesting review of Amy Chua&rsquo;s book trumpeting the superiority of Asian mothers. To boil it down as best I can, America was great because of its uncrowdedness(sic?). We are being subject to the Asian ultra-competitive/hard to stand out reality. With anti-whiteness the new national mantra it is not a good time for being a young white person. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the other end of this, at the university level. Liberal administrators beat their collective breasts over why there is a lack of black and hispanic students at elite schools (or even mediocre schools).  They will not recognize that the elementary/high school students in groups 2-3-4 are the ones who can not make minimal college entrance standards (and these standards are often lowered in the interests of multicultism).  So they push the &#8220;racism&#8221; button rather than face reality. </p>
<p>The level of self-deception is truly incredible.  But it gets back to liberalism being an ideology which is totally disconnected from reality. Unfortunately, liberals are dragging down the entire nation with them. </p>

<p>Not only did you misquote me with someone else&rsquo;s quote and then proceed to argue about something else in my post completely unrelated, but your comment doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.  I never argued about whether an American splitted the atom or not.  All I said was that it was a white achievement.</p>
<p>Ben,</p>
<p>Whenever I get into discussions like this with posters like you on the topic of Asians, you always bring up Strawman points about &#8220;we just can&rsquo;t act like we are superior to others&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, yes we can, when the things we claim to be proud of as whites are based on facts as opposed to fiction.  Why do people like you see that as so threatening?  I never said whites were superior anyways.  I went into the good things about Asians also but posters like you always conveniently overlook that. </p>
<p>This is about picking and choosing which areas whites outperform others, and which areas they don&rsquo;t.  When it comes to most things, whites do better than most others, and that is a fact and nothing to be ashamed of.  However, when comparing whites to Asians inparticular it starts to become a tougher battle.  We are better in some ways; they are better in others. But if you want to compare accomplishments and inventions, nobody can deny that whites are in fact superior in that department.</p>
<p>As far as who is superior overall, well, I don&rsquo;t see whites ever immigrating to East Asia, but I see the reverse.</p>

		<p>sshadow,  Clarification of actual modern IQ of Caucasians, an update.</p>
<p> Germans Highest average IQ In The World: 107 <br>
« on: March 05, 2009, 10:12:28 AM »  </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p> &#8221; Apparently, Germans are the most intelligent people in the World. In general, European Caucasians have high average IQs that far surpass that of most other peoples/races in the World by 1 standard deviation(South Asians, Middle Easterners, Mestizos and black Americans) to 2(pure African blacks and Australian aborigenes), but whites are slightly surpassed by Northeast Asians, who score between 3 to 5 points higher than whites. However, Germans seem to be an exception to this, as they topped the two highest scoring East Asian countries of Japan(105) and South Korea(106). The really amazing thing is that the average German IQ was dragged down by the population of Turkish descent that live in Germany and was included in the sample, because they have an average IQ of 89 and compromise almost 20% of the population. This means that the average IQ of white Germans is arguably higher than that around 110 and maybe as high as 112. The incredible German result is not surprising given it is the land of Gauss, Soppenhauer, Kant, Goethe, Leibniz and Heisenberg.&#8221;</p>
<p>  www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article697134.ece</p>
<p>England is normed at 100, and France is 94, no doubt robbed by La Guillotine and many Muslims. Haven&rsquo;t seen their white average.  The most coveted car in China is Mercedes.  If you exclude Paki&rsquo;s and others the white English IQ likely approaches the teutonic ideal.  It should be remembered that Liebnitz and Newton independently developed Calculus at about the same time.  As a result they were never especially good friends.</p>
<p>Hamburg had an average IQ of 109 about 10 years ago.  The malarky about Asiatic IQ is getting a little tiresome.  They do well because of severe and austere stance toward studying, and pretty good brains.  If there are genetically determined neuronal clusters responsible for creativity, then all reason dictates that these are most concentrated in central and western Europe.</p>

<p>Actually, still to this day, the best quality of paper is made out of textile (cloth), or has a certain amount of cloth in it. The only reason most paper nowadays is made out of wood is cost.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be careful with statements like this. This is a minor factor, though important. Had Europeans never learned anything from Asia or the Middle East, I highly doubt the world would look too different today. Most of the basic and crude achievements (crude by modern standards) Europeans learned from other civilizations were developed by different groups simultaneously in different parts of the world. They were created by anybody smart enough to develop a civilization.  Europeans would have eventually started civilization on their own, and the only reason they had a late start compared to others was because, unlike China, the Middle East, and India, Europe wasn&rsquo;t blessed with lush river valleys and abundant natural resources. </p>
<p>I am not demeaning the achievements of others&rsquo;, but the statement you made just needs to be taken with discression.</p>
<p>Most of Europe&rsquo;s achievements are it&rsquo;s own and nobody else&rsquo;s.  We can argue all day about how the idea of the computer actually came from the abacus, but it is pointless.  Many Chinese professors of history themselves get embarrassed by ideas like this fabricated by limp wristed PC Western white apologists.</p>
<p>And whether you disagree with Bon&rsquo;s point about paper or not, she has a point about how the Chinese, more and more, are given credit for inventing and discovering things that were actually invented and discovered by whites.  I have read many books on the history of science and technology, and it is quite easy for me to tell when a source like Wikipedia is commiting a fallacy when it makes it seem as if more science came out of China and India as opposed to Europe.  The mythical laundry list of Chinese &#8220;firsts&#8221; grows longer and longer by the day and we as whites shouldn&rsquo;t be putting up with it, simply because most of it is propaganda, not to mention that it is anti-white propaganda.</p>

<p>Yeah, I notice that when the educators and the media always talk about the &#8216;racial gap&rsquo;, they never compare students to Asians. It&rsquo;s always white vs everyone else with the idea that whites are privileged or oppressors. Why would you make a big deal out of comparing everyone to the middle group and not the highest? It&rsquo;s not necessarily a demographic thing. The same fixation goes on even in California where the Asian population is pretty high. </p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t understand my post.</p>
<p>It is Whites who are being demeaned and cheated, our achievements co-opted by those who did not create them, our innovations assigned to non-Whites.  </p>
<p>Modern textbooks claim Whites &#8220;stole&#8221; from non-Whites the scientific discoveries our people made and the inventions, innovations and creations we generated, implying we Whites are too stupid, backwards and evil to have created the Modern World   &mdash;   the jet engine, interplanetary probes, germ theory, clean water, satellite telemetry, modern medicine, vaccinations, cell phones, televisions, computers   &mdash;   just for starters. </p>
<p>If we Whites don&rsquo;t stand up for our people, our heritage and our great achievements <i>who will?</i> </p>
<p>I deal with government-approved textbooks every single day that state such things as The US Constitution was co-opted by evil White slave holders from gaia-loving Iroquois Indians and citations of all kinds of ridiculous African and/or African American achievements straight off the <i>Black Invention Myths</i> list.   </p>
<p>My 17- year old told me that it says in his textbook that  Calculus was created and developed by Arabs. <b>No mention of Newton or Leibniz.</b></p>
<p><i>These lies are being taught to ALL American children in the K-12 educational system.</i></p>
<p>We Whites are being demeaned and dehumanized by our own government.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>Actually, one of the most remarkable historical achievements of European, White people, has been the ability to discover, study and use foreign peoples&rsquo; achievements. It has been decisive in the success of Western civilization.</i></p>
<p>No true.  </p>
<p>The decisive factor in the success of Western Civilization has been the adherence to Rule of Law and Equality Under the Law, Free Markets, Private Property Rights, Rationalism, Self-Criticism, the Disinterested Search for Truth, the Separation of Church and State, Freedom of Thought and Expression and Respect for Human Rights, including Women&rsquo;s Rights.  </p>
<p>It is only Western Civilization that recognizes and defends the rights of the individual and allows us the freedom to choose how to live our lives. </p>
<p>When the tenants of Western Civilization are honored and respected, as they once were in the Western World, the human spirit is unleashed, civilization flourishes and prospers, life expectancy increases and life becomes infinitely better for everyone; where these tenants are ignored, grinding poverty, disease, war, misery and oppression reign.</p>
<p>It is no accident that the Industrial Revolution occurred in England and nearly every scientific discovery of the past 500 years, from electricity to computers, has taken place in the West.  </p>
<p>Western Civilization was created and developed by Whites, as a reflection of White DNA and is superior to any others devised by humankind.  </p>
<p>Period.</p>

		<p>@ Courtney from Alabama,</p>
<p>Sorry if I misquoted you Courtney, let me at least tell you that it is not intentional.</p>
<p>You say, &#8220;Well, yes we can, when the things we claim to be proud of as whites are based on facts as opposed to fiction. Why do people like you see that as so threatening?&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t so much that I see pride as threating but rather the DEGREE of pride being a problem.</p>
<p>I can value pride for belonging to ones own people and accomplishments, sure. For example, those accomplishments aren&rsquo;t mine or yours individually. We can recognize when pride in and of itself can become dangerous if we take credit for other&rsquo;s work. In which we won&rsquo;t strive and only live on past achievements. Likewise, the degree of pride for just belonging to a group can be dangerous; so where do you draw the line with pride?</p>
<p>I looked up the definition of pride and this is what I got:<br>
PRIDE (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pride): </p>
<p>1. A sense of one&rsquo;s own proper dignity or value; self-respect.<br>
2. Pleasure or satisfaction taken in an achievement, possession, or association: parental pride.<br>
3. Arrogant or disdainful conduct or treatment; haughtiness.<br>
4.<br>
a. A cause or source of pleasure or satisfaction; the best of a group or class: These soldiers were their country&rsquo;s pride.<br>
b. The most successful or thriving condition; prime: the pride of youth.<br>
5. An excessively high opinion of oneself; conceit.<br>
6. Mettle or spirit in horses.<br>
7. A company of lions. See Synonyms at flock1.<br>
8. A flamboyant or impressive group: a pride of acrobats.<br>
tr.v. prid·ed, prid·ing, prides<br>
To indulge (oneself) in a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction: I pride myself on this beautiful garden.</p>
<p>As you can see certain aspects or degrees of pride can be good (like 1.) but lets look at some other parts. 3., and 5.</p>
<p>If you have &#8220;an excessively high opinion of oneself; conceit,&#8221; is that a good thing? Can one learn from others as well as themselves if they excessively have an high opinion of oneself to the point of conceit? Is &#8220;arrogant or disdainful conduct or treatment; haughtiness&#8221; a good trait? Extreme pride doesn&rsquo;t allow for growth. A strength besides pride is also humility and the ability to learn and grow. The more pride one has the less likely they are to learn and grow, yes?</p>
<p>I believe this group, white nationalism, has potential. But one of the biggest inhibiting factors is the extreme amount of pride. <br>
Lets assume that White nationalism becomes a dominant force and then we get an ethic-state. Assuming that other factors don&rsquo;t come into play, then what? Life just becomes perfect? You claim that whites were so great at innovation, a prerequisite for inventions, yet to be innovative (to bring about something new) doesn&rsquo;t one have to be open minded and not contempt with the status-quo? Doesn&rsquo;t one have to take into account what others have found out before and build on top of it? Will this group of people will just rely on old accomplishments, that whites, as group got simply because they&rsquo;re white? What happens if, hypothetically some other racial group does indeed invent something that is useful? Will we simply not take it because it is &#8220;non white.&#8221; Do you see where I&rsquo;m getting at here? Taking from others isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing, it is what you take that determines whether it is good or bad.</p>
<p>Can you, for example, name me what you believe are strengths that Asians have that whites don&rsquo;t (since you mentioned that both have strengths and weaknesses)? Will people with extreme amount of pride not want to mention the strengths of others out of a personal threat to themselves? But isn&rsquo;t as you say a true strength, our ability to innovate as a people, mean we can see what is lacking?</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as who is superior overall, well, I don&rsquo;t see whites ever immigrating to East Asia, but I see the reverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like Mexicans immigrating to the US, as it has to do with the standard of living. I agree. But I don&rsquo;t think this will be for long. China is the rising superpower whether you like it or not. As America (and Europe) decline due to diversity, do you believe immigration will slow down? When China becomes the superpower do you think people from 3rd world will want to move there? I think so. </p>

<p>When the tenants of Western Civilization are honored and respected, as they once were in the Western World, the human spirit is unleashed, civilization flourishes and prospers, life expectancy increases and life becomes infinitely better for everyone; where these tenants are ignored, grinding poverty, disease, war, misery and oppression reign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bon, I could not agree more. As a white teacher who teaches in a predominantly Hispanic school on the West Coast and lives in sections of the city with decent real estate values, I can relate to the issues and friction that sometimes result between property owners and their lessees. As a board member of my local homeowner&rsquo;s association, I have had to deal with minority tenants (Hispanics) and am sympathetic to the owners in what they have to go through when they lease to minorities. Though, it has also been my experience that grinding poverty, disease, and reigning oppression persist when tenants are ignored. The plight of the people rests in the balance between these two groups. Either extreme benefits only one side. </p>

		<p>Ben,</p>
<p>I was talking to an Anonymous poster above in regards to &#8220;misquoting me&#8221; ; not you.</p>
<p>The rest of my post was directed at you.  I appreciate your civility in your posts, but once again, in your second post, just like the first, you are going into strawman and red herring tangents.  </p>
<p>As I said before, you obviously overlooked the parts of my first post where I mentioned the strengths of Asians.  Please go back and read that.  I shouldn&rsquo;t have to repeat it again, especially considering that most of your points towards me are based on your supposed idea that &#8220;I overlook Asian attributes that are positive&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just because I have mentioned the strengths of whites, there is no reason for you to come to the conclusion that that means I am saying whites are superior overall. I don&rsquo;t really understand the fabric of your argument to begin with. I said whites are superior in the department of inventing. If that is true, then why can&rsquo;t I talk about it?</p>
<p>Did you read the stuff Bon went into in her post about what modern school textbooks say?  Perhaps white people should be directing more of their anger towards the fact that the achievements of whites are being attributed to others than white people being prideful.</p>
<p>Ben, white people are the only people in the world getting demeaned and getting their history taken away from them.  It disturbs me that posters like you on here waste your time lecturing whites like me on &#8220;don&rsquo;t be prideful&#8221;. It is a waste of time.</p>
<p>You end your post by assuring me China will rule the world.  This is another thing I don&rsquo;t get.  You say it as if you want it to happen.  If it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, then how can we be certain it is going to happen?  Once it happens, if it does, I am sure all the other races in the world will wish whites still ran things.</p>
<p>No offense, Ben, but when I discuss things like this with posters like you on the Asian topic, it seems your arguments mostly consist of strawmans on why whites can&rsquo;t be prideful, basing Asia&rsquo;s greatness on past achievements it never accomplished, or basing Asia&rsquo;s greatness on something that hasn&rsquo;t even happened yet.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Where were they when we were sending men to the moon or splitting the atom? The Asians are good at making Asian countries successful (with the help of white technology), and white people are best suited for making Western Civilization what it is. No other race can do it the same as we can, nor should they be allowed to.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounds very much as if you&rsquo;d prefer it if East Asia ceased its buying of American credit, and sold their trillions in assets and investments overnight.</p>
<p>Ignoring the $3 trillion &#8220;foreign exchange reserves&#8221; held by East Asians, Japan is and has been the world&rsquo;s top creditor nation for decades with a net $2.98 trillion invested overseas as of 2010- nearly a tenth of it in the US.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t agree more- Japan, China, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong should stop interfering with the US and pull all $5 trillion of their investments overnight. East Asian Americans should dump their properties and stocks and leave for Asia and stop freeloading off of hard working whites. This is a win-win scenario for everyone, as East Asia will gain much needed human and financial capital while America will be one step ahead in dealing with its racial problem.</p>

&#8220;If ethnic Germans have around 109/110 in IQ, it explains the Ashkenazi IQ.&#8221;  from post 54.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t automatically explain it, but with some proviso&rsquo;s it allows for your thesis.  If some particularly gifted Jewish males traveled a long distance to do usury that Catholics weren&rsquo;t allowed to do, about 1000 years ago along the Rhine, when and where Ashkenazi existence was first discovered, and since travel was difficult, and women may have been excess baggage, they may have mated with upper crust German women.  Presumeably Germans with wealth were on average smarter than those who were poor. These are people they would have mixed with.  The concept of &#8220;hybrid vigor&#8221; may have been operative. Judaism was ususally traced matrilineally, but their may have been exceptions.  It&rsquo;s interesting to note that at an average IQ of 110, roughtly 20 % of frauleins would pass genes on that would dictate IQ&rsquo;s of 130-150.  A study of mitochondrial DNA could explain an age old mystery. You may be on to something.</p>

&#8220;Often the allegation is heard that paper was invented in China or Egypt. In neither of these two civilizations was paper used: in China a textile based parchment was used&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the most basic form of writing medium that China developed (ink on silk- from some millennium BC). The use of pulp was incorporated by 200 BC.</p>
<p>&#8220;As with paper, the allegation is often heard that printing was invented in China. This is also untrue: in China a simple system of pattern inking had been developed in which a strip of material was lain against a water based painted picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>See above. China developed movable type in AD 1000.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese had what they called &lsquo;fire powder&rsquo; - an inflammable chemical which they used in bamboo tubes to make clay pellet firing &lsquo;rockets.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Correct, that is the embryonic form of gunpowder weapons in China. By 1200 the formula was refined enough that black powder stores could explode with enough force to maim and kill dozens of people in a large area. But more importantly the fact that China held out against the Mongols at the height of their strength for 70 years while they rode into Baghdad and decimated the Islamic world in less than 3 should be more than enough evidence to put to rest the notion that Muslims had more advanced weapons in their Golden Age than China.</p>
<p>&#8220;A 14th Century German monk, Berthold Schwarz, was the first person to use gunpowder to fire a substantial projectile, and can rightly be given the title of inventor of the firearm&hellip;Gunpowder factories had been established in England and Germany in 1334 and 1340 respectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Berthold Schwarz explanation is legend with no surviving records to corroborate it. Roger Bacon predated him, and even then he was decades behind the Mongols in the use of gunpowder weapons in the area.</p>
<p>David wrote<br>
&#8220;The average IQ of China is 100, not 105(most of those early tests were taken in places like Shanghai which is not comparable to the country at large).&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Shanghai is not comparable. They routinely score the lowest out of all municipalities and provinces on the NCEE (National College Entrance Exams) in China despite being given an easier test. The 105 figure is given by Lynn after a revision of your (his) older 100 figure.</p>
<p>S&GS;<br>
&#8220;It was English folks in the late 1700s who first thought that there should be no slavery, that there should be individual rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>A ban on slavery was attempted by a Chinese Emperor who interrupted the Han Dynasty. Regardless, the slave population in China has never approached 2% (the vast majority of them foreign invaders and criminals as we can see from genetic evidence) so it wasn&rsquo;t much of an issue to begin with.</p>
<p>Courtney<br>
&#8220;As far as who is superior overall, well, I don&rsquo;t see whites ever immigrating to East Asia, but I see the reverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are millions (6+m) of Russians in Manchuria alone. That&rsquo;s not counting the Sakha Republic and Tuva.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europeans would have eventually started civilization on their own, and the only reason they had a late start compared to others was because, unlike China, the Middle East, and India, Europe wasn&rsquo;t blessed with lush river valleys and abundant natural resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>China is not blessed with lush river valleys. In the best of years they are as productive as European Russia or Central Europe. In the worst of years they flood and kill millions of people through starvation. It takes immense toil to even keep the best land in East Asia manageable- frequent damming, terracing and other work is required to reduce the floods to catastrophes from world-enders. And thanks to the Himalayas, this same area naturally would have degraded into a desert if not for the efforts of North Chinese farmers to preserve it.</p>
<p>#45<br>
&#8220;Hamburg had an average IQ of 109 about 10 years ago. The malarky about Asiatic IQ is getting a little tiresome. They do well because of severe and austere stance toward studying, and pretty good brains. If there are genetically determined neuronal clusters responsible for creativity, then all reason dictates that these are most concentrated in central and western Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing to note, there isn&rsquo;t one IQ test. The results you are referring to for Germany (the famous 107 figure) is derived from Cattell Culture Fair, on which Hong Kong scored 113. Not surprisingly they are the wealthiest people on the planet. Before GDP figures are brought up, note that wealth describes accumulated assets and GDP is measure of production, not how much of that production contributes to financial security.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has the most billionaires per capita, the second highest HWNI ratio ($dollar millionaies as a percentage of the population), the largest net investment position per capita (around $1.5 trillion among 7 million people).</p>

<p>Vert true. As a Belgian, I can attest to the fact that in Europe the wealthiest community are the Asian Indians. Infact, the world Diamond trade which used to be dominated by the Hassidic Jews is now dominated and run by Indians from Gujrat. They also seem highly educated, intelligent and cunning. Theres something about them that bothers me. I feel that Asian Indians hate whites even more than other races. They may smile and act polite on your face, but once you turn - they are busy trying to dispossess ethnic whites in economic, scientific-technological and academic terms. I was also surprised to see the number of CEO&rsquo;s, Scientists, Venture capitalists, Deans of some Ivy league univsersities and Federal officers (Vivek Kundra - Chief Information officer &amp; Aneesh Chopra - Chief Technology Officer) in America who are of Indian origin. They almost dominate the technology sector. This is potentially dangerous for America. As a white European, I would never trust any Asiatic group to serve our interests. I also dislike their attitude - very shrewd, cunning, love for money and arrogant. Indians are the community I tend to dislike the most even though most of them here are wealthy, legal and pay their taxes.</p>

<p>The Chinese developed a labor-intensive process for making a textile-based &#8220;paper&#8221; that no one uses today.  </p>
<p><i>The ancient Chinese first made paper in the following fashion:</i></p>
<p><i>Plant fibers such as hemp were soaked and beaten into a sludge.</i></p>
<p><i>The sludge was strained through a cloth sieve attached to a frame that also served as a drying platform for the resulting paper.</i></p>
<p>Can you imagine anyone using this process to mass produce books, newspapers and the zillions of reams of lined paper used in classrooms today?</p>
<p>It is in the West that the process of using wood pulp to make paper and a system for the mass production of paper was developed.</p>
<p><i>Only in 1840, was the process of producing paper from ground wood developed in Europe, and the idea of adding chemicals only took place in 1850, creating the modern paper making process which has lasted to this day.</i></p>
<p><i>In Europe and America, the mass-production of paper became a thriving industry supplying huge volumes of paper for the production of newspapers, books, magazines, paper bags, toilet paper, money and a huge variety of other purposes.</i> </p>
<p>&#8220;China developed movable type in AD 1000.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>In the Far East, movable type and printing presses were known but did not make printing from individually carved wooden blocks, from movable clay type, processes much more efficient than hand copying. Since there are thousands of Chinese characters, the benefit of the technique is not as obvious as in European languages.</i></p>
<p>Moveable type does not a printing press make.</p>
<p><i>In 1440, German inventor Johannes Gutenberg invented a printing press process. The inventor&rsquo;s method of printing from movable type, including the use of metal molds and alloys, a special press, and oil-based inks, allowed for the first time the mass production of printed books.</i> 	</p>
<p><i>The print technology that produced the Gutenberg Bible marks the beginning of a cultural revolution unlike any that followed the development of print culture in Asia.</i></p>
<p>As in the ability to mass produce the written word which revolutionized the spread of knowledge!</p>
<p><i>The ready availability and affordability of the printed word to the general public boosted the democratization of knowledge and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and permanently altered the structure of society. Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming the sole medium for modern bulk printing.<i></i></i></p>
<p>&#8220;The embryonic form of gunpowder weapons in China.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The origins of gunpowder are unknown but evidence indicates that the Chinese first developed it, for pyrotechnic not propellant use, prior to ad 1000. However, the use of this explosive mixture of saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur as a propellant for bullets from firearms, and thus gunpowder, is a western development and one which took place gradually from the 13th century.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Hong Kong has the most billionaires per capita&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure they do and good for them!  They&rsquo;ve adopted legal (Their <i>Basic Law</i>), economic and financial systems developed in the West which have allowed them to flourish   &mdash;   small government, low taxes, and light regulation.</p>
<p>BTW:  This is my last post on this matter, although it is critically important to defend the importance of Western Civilization in developing the modern world   &mdash;    and guard against other cultures laying claim to Western innovations and creations.</p>

<p>Can you imagine using a rotary dialing phone and black-and-white displays? </p>

Re post #60.  Fairly impressive.  It appears you have a good brain.</p>
<p>Not being able to verify if the recent tests are Cattell or not, I took a different approach.  Going to the 09 PISA reading scores, I did a parallel analysis, utilizing some modest Algebra.<br>
Scores <br>
Turkey 464<br>
Germany 497<br>
Shanghai-China 556<br>
Hong Kong-China 533<br>
Macao-China 487<br>
 <br>
In Germany about 30% of students are migrants, mostly Turkish.  According to an article in The  Economist they speak neither Turkish nor German well.  I am assuming an average score in reading of 400. &#8220;http://www.economist.com/node/10958534&#8221;.<br>
Assume 1000 children, 700 German whites, and 300 Turks.  <br>
Then 400x300 plus Xx700 equals 1000x497.  Solving for X, which is the true PISA score for German whites you will get 538.  This betters Hong Kong which is an unrepresentative city-state anyway.  Shanghai is an elite financial city, which is kind of like taking the average IQ of an elite university town in the USA and claiming that it is representative of the entire country.  One wonders what the scores of deep interior rural Chinese hog farmers would be. It strains credibility to think that the true average scores for all of China wouuld be as high as 497, much less 538.  Interesting discussion though.  <br>

<p>Actually, Courtney, I have not used any strawman and red herrings.</p>
<p>I read your post carefully. </p>
<p>Not once had you mentioned anything useful that Chinese or Asians in general have contributed to or are (as you put it) &#8220;superior&#8221; in some way. You very vaguely stated saying that they have some strengths and we do not. Nothing concrete. You say that they have a slightly higher IQ and are more disciplined, yet diminish anything Asians could have accomplished by saying, &#8220;The Asians are good at making Asian countries successful (with the help of white technology).&#8221; You never go into specifics of what makes/made Asian countries successful. And any ability to be successful had to do with, white technology, which would contradict your statements about Asians having slightly higher IQ. As well as many other vague and contradictory statements.</p>
<p>It is also clear to me that you, after I wrote all about pride and my actual position, you completely ignore it by saying, &#8220;It disturbs me that posters like you on here waste your time lecturing whites like me on &#8216;don&rsquo;t be prideful.&rsquo; It is a waste of time.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes indeed. A complete waste of time. Or should I say, of my time since I&rsquo;m the one who wrote that entire post only to have it deemed as a &#8220;waste of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You end your post by assuring me China will rule the world. This is another thing I don&rsquo;t get. YOU SAY IT AS IF YOU WANT IT TO HAPPEN. If it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, then how can we be certain it is going to happen? Once it happens, if it does, I am sure all the other races in the world will wish whites still ran things.&#8221;</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think you have the right to say who makes straw-mans and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yes, I have read Bon&rsquo;s post. I agree that often history or science is diluted or misconstrued where credit is often not given to a individual from a particular racial group, in many cases whites. </p>
<p>But unlike you or Bon, I have this radical idea that technology/innovation/science is a dynamic process which evolves over time with different people adding within a particular field. </p>
<p>Technology is a dynamic tree not separate stones. </p>
<p>You have the idea that a single innovation made a individual from a particular group lays claim to the entire field. If you actually read my counter argument to Bon, this becomes clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that you feel, as you put it, that people like me disturb you. I might recommend that this may not be the right site for you, because if you ever have listened to Jared Taylor (the originator of the site), he must disturb you as much, if not more.</p>

		<p>The only thing constant Bon is change.  The Itruscans have disappeared and their civilization was supplanted by the Romans who borrowed much from them.</p>
<p>Likewise the Germans who destroyed Roman civilization became civilized within a span of some centuries.</p>
<p>I suspect that the original civilizations that developed agriculture have long since been absorbed or disappeared.   If you read the work of virologist Luis P Villareal he makes a startling and compelling claim: that viruses genetic parasites were responsible for the evolution of life.  Competition by virusses amongst themselves and viral colonization of life and life&rsquo;s response to viral colonization is what pushed evolution.</p>
<p>In a way cultures are no different, they absorb and learn things from other cultures and are changed forever as a result.  The West absorbed what it needed from China and Arabia to develop and evolve inversely China absorbed alot from the West and was able to go from being a backwards country into a global superpower in less than 50 years.   </p>
<p>An Italian observer once made an excellent observation about the Brits &#8220;How could a country rise from poverty and squalor to world dominion?&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that the nations and cultures of this world may change beyond recognition after six or seven hundred years.  Look at Mexico, a whole new human group &#8220;La Raza&#8221; came into being after the European colonization of the new world.  </p>
<p>Of course I am realist too and realize that the collapse of this world like the collapse of the Roman world will not be a pretty sight and it could be a miserable place for a few hundred years.  However we have to accept that fact that change is inevitable.  If we don&rsquo;t change then the world changes despite us with profound if not shocking consequences.</p>
<p>All things have their time and we are living in a monumentous era of change far more dramatic than even the 1960&rsquo;s.  It&rsquo;s our choice to adapt to the new world or die with old one.     </p>

		<p>Courtney: Whites created most of the modern world as we know it but they weren&rsquo;t the first. Civilization started in the Middle East and the East, with China one of those primarily leading the pack. It&rsquo;s but natural that the West surpassed the East in accomplishment: the ones who follow usually improve and expand on what the originators started. So saying the East loses to the West because the latter accomplished more is as ludicrous as saying the Wright Brothers lose because their inventions don&rsquo;t match up to modern aviation technology. As the saying goes: &#8220;You can&rsquo;t beat the first&#8221;.</p>

<p>If I don&rsquo;t stand up for Whites and Western Civilization created by Whites <i>who will?</i></p>
<p>These rebuttals against Whites and White Civilization always amuse me.  Did you notice we are conducting these debates in English and not in an Asian language?  And on a medium developed by Whites?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moveable type does not a printing press make.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Both paper and movable type inspired Gutenberg&rsquo;s press.</i></p>
<p>There is no evidence Gutenberg was inspired by &#8216;moveable type&rsquo; from China, the process Gutenberg used was substantially different from anything used in Asia.</p>
<p>You seem to want to make sure we Whites are not given credit for anything we&rsquo;ve innovated.   Do you work for the government?  The media?  Academia?  The $PLC?  This is part of the party line in their War on Whites: to assign our creations to others.</p>
<p><i>All things have their time and we are living in a monumentous era of change far more dramatic than even the 1960&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s our choice to adapt to the new world or die with old one.</i></p>
<p>There will be no adapting for us Whites, only genocide.</p>
<p>At least there is not a war on Asians as there is on Whites.  Even in the US, you Asians are allowed to keep your language and culture and are even encouraged to celebrate them.  You are allowed to organize yourselves politically into advocacy groups for your own people, something not allowed to us Whites <i>even in our own homelands.</i>  </p>
<p>No one is allowed to speak up for us or promote our rights without being called a Nazi.  We cannot form advocacy groups.  The DOJ works against us, allowing black thugs to intimidate our people at the voting booth.   Yeah, that makes sense!  Our young White males died in foreign lands to fight Nazis only to have their descendants be compared to Nazis by our own government.</p>
<p>Our own governments favor non-Whites over us, including flooding our homelands in Europe, Canada, America, Australia, SA and New Zealand with hostile &#8220;others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hell, we cannot even have a forum to discuss our issues without being attacked by non-Whites.  We cannot meet without being shut down.</p>
<p>When our own governments work mightily against our interests and, in fact, works to reduce our numbers, it is end times for us.</p>
<p>Again, lock this into your psyche:</p>
<p><b>There will be no adapting for us Whites, only genocide.</b></p>

<p><i>Rather, Southern China was the richest region in the world for hundreds of years before. They instead had to be insulated from the Western idea of Communism. It is Confucianism and Chinese culture which created their work ethic and focus on study.</i></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know your history:  Communism is not a Western Idea; it was not implemented by Westerners.  See here for a brief but very good overview:  http://tinyurl.com/9ket5</p>
<p>Our people, like your people in Communist China and SE Asia, paid a very heavy genocidal price at the hands of Communists.</p>

<p>But, don&rsquo;t worry, as I wrote above, our own government is working toward our genocide.  We&rsquo;ll be gone soon along with the civilization we created, replaced by authoritarian-style government with no one will be left to defend us.</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/y8bblex</p>
<p>After discussions such as this, I wonder if you are looking forward to our demise.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s assuming the German education system is not better than Turkey&rsquo;s. It is- and that&rsquo;s also assuming Hong Kong and Shanghai are elite, they are not.</p>
<p>Shanghai, as was said above, consistently scores the lowest in high school entrance exams. China has a household registration system that makes it impossible for migrants to settle in Shanghai permanently (which is why the population is 20 million, not 100).</p>
<p>Both Hong Kong and to a much lesser degree Shanghai also have varying degrees of Southeast Asian blood. Another problem is that so many East Asian children hit the PISA ceiling that the scores are artificially depressed.</p>
<p>Not least of all, per student spending on education is miniscule.</p>

<p>The Economist article said that the Turks spoke neither Turkish, nor German well.  I am assuming that poor language skills would be reflected poorly in a reading test, unlike in their native country.</p>
<p>How can you contend that Shanghai students score lowest in their HS entrance exams when their PISA scores are the highest in all the world, and higher than Hong Kong and Macao.  It makes no sense.  Do you expect us to believe that?  It impeaches everything else that you say.  You should know that you should have explained such a seeming inconsistency at the outset.  <br>

		<p>I have been away from the discussion for a few days, and now that I have come back I see that the discussion is pretty much dead.  Having said that, I want to share the email that I wrote to Ben above in regards to this discussion&hellip;&hellip;.it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to try, whether or not someone on here actually reads this:</p>
<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>I was occupied with other things for a few days and wasn&rsquo;t able to answer your posts or other people&rsquo;s posts on Amren in that discussion we were having on Asians.  The last post was put up on February 23rd, so it appeared to me, when I checked in yesterday, that the discussion was pretty much dead&hellip;..so I decided to try to send you an email.</p>
<p>This email is intended to explain where I am coming from and not to be mean.  </p>
<p>Having said that though, I noticed inparticular your comment indicating that I need to find another website and that people like Jared Taylor would offend me.  I have been posting on Amren for almost seven years, even though I am only in my late twenties.   I even attended the 2006 conference. I am well versed on what Jared Taylor as well as what Rushton has to say about Asians, which isn&rsquo;t too far off from what I say.  I have been debating the Asian intelligence issue with people on Amren for years now.  Sometimes most posters under an article agree with everything I say, other times it is 50/50, and yet other times most people don&rsquo;t agree with me.  It all depends on who is reading the article at the time. However, the overall consensus seems to be that most people agree that whites dominate in innovation.</p>
<p>I am well aware that Asians have slightly higher IQs than whites.  I am also well aware that they are more disciplined (both of which I made clear in my post).  But even Rushton and Jared Taylor have both acknowledged, just like I do, that Asians are lacking in the creativity department compared to whites.  IQ has so many angles to it, and just because you have a high IQ that doesn&rsquo;t mean you are genetically creative.  If we applaud Asians on the website in regards to their disciplined group mentality (which I do), then isn&rsquo;t it hypocritical if we don&rsquo;t applaud whites for their individualistic and &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221; mentality?</p>
<p>There have been scores of books written on this topic.  It simply can&rsquo;t be argued that anybody compares to whites in the innovation department historically.  Many authors who are hardly white nationalists, have written books on the history of science and technology, and they all seem to reach the same conclusion.  So that right there settles what Asians have accomplished historically.   As for the future, well, we can speculate that Asians will surpass us in innovation, but it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.  They have improved our televisions and computers, but were they the ones to invent them?  </p>
<p>I noticed a poster put something up about &#8220;where would we be without the modern technology of Asia&#8221; and he was trying to make it sound as if we would be stuck in the <br>
50&rsquo;s without their technology.  This is hardly the case.  Even the internet and the modern cell phone were invented by whites.  I agree that Asians are good at taking our inventions and making them better but that hardly means that they are equal at inventing.</p>
<p>Another poster put up a post in response to me going into the ancient civilizations of Asia and the Middle East.  He/she said that because they were the first that that meant that they were somehow equal to or better than what Europe ever produced.  I face people who try to say this to me all the time on Amren, and once again (just like most people I argue with), they miss the point entirely.  I never said that the Middle East or China wasn&rsquo;t the first to create civilization&hellip;.in fact I said just the opposite.  But how does any of this mean that those two regions created just as much as Europe has?  If what they created in ancient times was really equal to what we did in modern times, then why didn&rsquo;t they get there first, and why is the Middle East and India inparticular so backwards today compared to us?</p>
<p>East Asia on the other hand (unlike India and the Middle East) is quite capable of being modern since they have IQs higher than whites.  However, this hardly means they are equal at coming up with original ideas. </p>
<p>Some people on the website were mentioning how well Indians and Jews do in America.  They do well as well, but while Jews have a high IQ just like Northeast Asians do, the Indians overall, most certainly do not.  Rushton and Jared Taylor acknowledge that India has an average IQ of 81.  The only reason Indians do so well in the West is because we are getting their cream of the crop immigrants.  And out of a country of a billion people, there are going to be a lot of smart people, even if they are only 1% of the Indian population.</p>
<p>The reason I get worked up about this topic on the website is because the fact of the matter is that white people are the only people getting their history taken away from them.  It is time for us to get serious about taking it back.  I am hardly the person to say &#8220;WHITES INVENTED EVERYTHING&#8221;.  That right there is what I consider &#8220;arrogant &#8221; and &#8220;prideful&#8221; as you were saying.  But if the facts are that whites have created MOST (not all) of the scientific achievements in history, I really don&rsquo;t understand what is wrong when someone like myself wishes to talk about it. Whites need more pride right now.  We are the people with the least amount of pride in the world right now due to political correctness and leftist brain washing.  Naturally I am going to question the motives of posters who tell me I can&rsquo;t talk about what whites are good at when it is based on facts.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this,<br>

		<p>Courtney,</p>
<p>Regardless of what the average IQ in India is, Indians in the U.S. have enjoyed unprecedented success despite often having skin darker than most Blacks. Unlike East Asians, we are mistaken for Black on a regular basis. The fact that we &#8220;look black&#8221; and have the highest per capita income of any ethnic group in America PROVES the whole point of the article in the first place. It&rsquo;s not skin color holding you-know-who back. </p>

		<p>Rajesh, you prove my point further.  You are a fine example of a poster who has missed the point of what I have written.  I explained why Indians do well in America, and I never said anything about skin color.  I am glad that Indians are so insecure that they feel the need to lurk around websites like this and correct any white person who says anything negative about them.  You won&rsquo;t find me on an Indian-pride website, quite frankly because I could care less about it.</p>
