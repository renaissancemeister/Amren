			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Forliti, Cox News, February 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The girl was 12 when the gangsters told her the rule: They would sell her for sex to men outside the gang, but members of the Somali Outlaws or the Somali Mafia would use her for free.</p>
<p>For more than two years she was taken on &#8220;missions&#8221; to abandoned garages, men&rsquo;s bathrooms, apartments and hotels, enduring hours with multiple men so gang members could get money, pot or booze. Though her mother confronted two of the men twice early on and warned them the girl wasn&rsquo;t even 13, they continued to prostitute her.</p>
<p>Eventually some of the gang members took her on the road to new customers in Nashville, Tenn., while the man she called her &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; allegedly used a cell phone to send images of her engaging in sex acts with men in the car along the way.</p>
<p>The enterprise described in a federal indictment has shocked members of Minnesota&rsquo;s Somali community, the largest in the U.S. And it suggests that gangs known in recent years for armed robberies, burglaries and even killings of fellow East Africans have evolved into more lucrative activity, and are taking their crimes from Minneapolis to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s clear the life of the gang in the community is getting much more complicated,&#8221; said Omar Jamal, an advocate for the Somali community in Minneapolis. &#8220;It&rsquo;s one thing to go out and have a random action. It&rsquo;s something quite new to the community to have an organized sex trafficking.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Somalis began arriving in Minnesota in the early 1990s  &mdash;  refugees fleeing civil war in their homeland and finding welcome in a state with a strong tradition of helping newcomers. But as young Somalis entered the school system with little or no formal education or English skills, they were targeted by established gangs for being different.</p>
<p>So they formed their own groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were trying to find identity,&#8221; said Hassan Mohamud, the imam at Islamic Da&rsquo;wah Center, a youth-oriented mosque and cultural center in St. Paul. &#8220;They do not belong to Somalis. They do not belong to Islam. They do not belong to America. So they found their own system.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They had good intention. At first the good intention was to help and support each other and protect. But they eventually changed that support system to harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The federal indictment unsealed in November in Tennessee charges 29 people with crimes from sex trafficking to credit card fraud to witness intimidation. It said the accused were members or associates of three Somali gangs  &mdash;  often acting as one larger gang  &mdash;  bent on forcing girls into prostitution for their own profit.</p>
<p>The indictment outlines allegations involving four victims and hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit card fraud. One girl was prostituted in Nashville and in Columbus, Ohio. Another was raped by multiple men in a Minnesota hotel room, the indictment said.</p>
<p>Jamal said that over the years, the Somali gangs realized they needed to generate a steady income. The crimes alleged in the indictment illustrate that at least some might have turned to sex trafficking and credit card fraud as a way to make money.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a gradual growth of becoming more active, becoming more serious,&#8221; Jamal said. &#8220;It speaks in volume of how the community has failed collectively to save the minors, especially the girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gang members started with street robberies, but realized the risk of getting hurt or arrested was too high compared to the profit potential, Brudenell [Jeanine Brudenell, a Minneapolis police officer who focuses on Somali gangs and crime] said. The street robberies stopped for a while after a fatal 2006 mugging  &mdash;  with Somalis at first mistakenly considered suspects  &mdash;  drew media attention. After that, the Somali gangs began committing more burglaries of businesses in an attempt to keep a lower profile, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She described the Somali gangs as more loosely organized than other gangs. There&rsquo;s no real leader, so if someone goes to prison, the group won&rsquo;t stop its activity, she said. There&rsquo;s also little evidence that people are &#8220;jumped in&#8221; to Somali gangs, she said. Instead, friends might just ask other friends to hang out and be in the gang.</p>
<p>There are seven Somali gangs in Minneapolis, and a total of about 200 documented Somali gang members and associates, she said  &mdash;  about 10 percent of the roughly 2,100 documented active gang members in the Minneapolis Police Department&rsquo;s system. The gang members are a small fraction of the Somali population: The U.S. Census says roughly 25,000 Somalis live in Minnesota, while local advocates say the number is much higher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to police department data, there were 138 gang-associated crimes committed in 2008 in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, an area just east of downtown Minneapolis where many Somali immigrants settled. The number of gang-associated crimes decreased to 100 in 2009, but went back up to 137 in 2010.</p>
<p>Brudenell said the crime ebbs and flows, often quieting down after major incidents. The data seems to back that up: After the killing of a Somali college student in Cedar-Riverside in September 2008, crime figures remained low for the next nine months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gang members often miss out on education, and some lack family support. &#8220;They don&rsquo;t feel like they belong to this community.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Most of them are not here for more than 5 years, and they already make so much trouble.</p>
<p>It is like the do-gooders were always told to: They will not come to the United States and be a good citizens who will always remain a minority which is thankful to whites for helping them. They will come here and make the same problems they had in their own country and blame whites for that.</p>

<p>They are correct, they don&rsquo;t.  The only logical solution is to rid the community of their unwanted presence.<br>

<p>They don&rsquo;t tell you anything more about these &#8220;established gangs.&#8221; That&rsquo;s because most of them were/are domestic blacks who only a generation or two prior moved to Minneapolis from Chicago and other similar cities, because of MN&rsquo;s generous welfare.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that most Americans could agree with them wholeheartedly; they do not belong in America. They need to return to Africa ASAP. It was a colossal blunder to ever bring them to America, foisted upon us by those who want to destroy America by bringing in this hideous virus.</p>

a bit of joy over this news. Good..let the liberal Minnesotans<br>
pay for their naivete in blood, and sorrow. They welcomed the<br>
Somalis..they preached Diversity to the rest of us ..now<br>
let them enjoy what Diversity really means. Coming up next<br>
real acts of terrorism..with lots of nice well meaning blond<br>
people staring out at the wreckage and despair and choking back<br>
the tears..and struggling one more time to cling on to their<br>

They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That comment reminds me of the Jamaican gang shootout on Boxing day at that mall in Canada a year or two ago, where the white girl was killed in the crossfire. Some politician said Canada hadn&rsquo;t done enough to welcome Jamaicans into Canadian society. It was noted by someone else that the murder rate among Jamaicans in Canada was about the same as in Jamaica, leading one to wonder if they also hadn&rsquo;t been properly welcomed in their own society as well.  </p>

		<p>What is happening in Minnesota, &amp; Holland, is also happening in my area of north London. The same appalling litany of crimes, plus the links to Al Shabab, the Al Qaeda franchise in Somalia. And, of course, their disgusting criminality is always, always, somebody else&rsquo;s fault, while their sense of entitlement knows no bounds.<br>
Our governing elite lives a very long way away from the consequences of its deranged immigration policies. But those of us at the sharp end are expected to tolerate the staggering levels of Somali wickedness, as if it were merely collateral damage, &amp; given time, these thugs will integrate. Like hell! The ONLY solution is deportation. It brings tears to my eyes to see what cultural Marxist destructors have done to the formerly cohesive societies of the USA &amp; Britain. They should be in prison, alongside the monsters they have unleashed upon us. God bless the USA.</p>

		<p>according to the FBI, there are over 1 million gang members in the US, the vast majority black and hispanic.</p>
<p>none of them &#8220;belong to the community,&#8221; all are enemies, aliens, and none have &#8220;good intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; turns out to mean &#8220;race suicide&#8221;, and even if whites wake up tomorrow, it might be too late, because out &#8220;democratically elected government&#8221; (corporate oligarchy) has no intention of giving our country back to us.</p>

		<p>The only reason Somalians are forming gangs is so they can prey upon the native population.  </p>
<p>The leftists that wanted them in this country are responsible for every crime the Somalis commit.  So are all those who enable their crimes by making excuses for their criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Every single Somali should be deported, then Somali criminals won&rsquo;t commit any more violent crimes against Americans.  </p>

When I speak with other whites I have a feeling All May Be Lost because they seem to be more on the side of the outsider rather than on the side of their own kind. Any creature that allows those who invade to set the rules in their own country will get what they deserve ( I Guess ) ?</p>

		<p>Never underestimate the role of the churches in all this.  The Lutherans in particular have been highly aggressive in sponsoring Somali arrivals to the Twin Cities area via their refugee resettlement program.  </p>
<p>There needs to be a serious theological debate in this country:  Is immigration restriction compatible with Christianity?  That is, might there be something about Christianity itself that renders followers incapable of grasping our nation&rsquo;s identity?  Or is that Christianity, noble in principle, has been distorted by certain among its followers?  </p>

The solution is simple: We need more diversity, so the emigrants feel like they belong here. <br>
[/sarcasm]</p>
<p>The jews, Irish, and Italians also formed gangs in New York when they arrived here 100+ years ago. There were many Chinese gangs in San Francisco in the late 1800&rsquo;s. Gangs are nothing new in the United States. One could say that the United States breeds the gang culture/mentality. </p>

		<p>Anon #6, I seriously doubt that Minnesota wanted this. This was unleashed upon Minnesota by the federal government, by so-called Christian organizations. If you ask the every day people on the street in Minnesota, I&rsquo;m sure that 90% of them despise it AND the Somalis, as well as those who unleashed them on Minnesotans and America.</p>

<p>Wow! Thanks for that!  Whew!  Now that you explain it like that, all is excused! How terrible of us American Natives not to understand your customs.</p>
<p>And, now for the good news:</p>
<p><i>After being closed for nearly two years, the US State Department is on the verge of resuming the fraud-ridden family reunification program that admitted as many as 36,000 Somalis fraudulently to the US between 2003 and 2008. The State Department is on the verge of re-opening the program and may already have done so.</i></p>
<p>Refugee Resettlement Watch reports:</p>
<p><i>The US has admitted 83,991 Somali Shariah-supporting immigrants to the US in 25 years.   More then half, 43,682, came since September 11th.  Each family has an average of six children.</i></p>
<p>Who is behind this?</p>
<p><i>Heidi Boas in her lengthy 2007 paper entitled, &#8216;The New Face of America&rsquo;s Refugees: African Refugee Resettlement to the United States:&rsquo; Congressional Black Caucus is one of the most influential groups advocating over the past decade for increased African refugee resettlement to the United States.</i></p>

<p>Why do you think the CBC is importing &#8220;workers&#8221; to displace American Blacks?  Or, is there a much more sinister reason for allowing backwards, violence-prone welfare parasites into the US?</p>

		<p>Make a case against it.</p>
<p>Americans may -seem- like the most gullible has beens on the planet but you MAKE A CASE, by the numbers, and they will see it for what it is and things will change.</p>
<p>How many Somalis become useful members of society at what wage level and with what degree of job stability?  How many are in a permanent dependent status as charges of the State?  How many have criminal records, here or back home?  How much does it cost to keep those in prison &#8216;suitably housed&rsquo;?  How much does it cost to deport them to a neutral country and have private corportations take them back into Somalia proper?</p>
<p>We could -so easily- turn this around.  With a little foot work to put together raw statistics.  Most especially because the Somalis are right: they -are- outsiders.  To other blacks and muslims alreay here who have little desire to be tarred with the same brush for their actions.</p>
<p>A small, unprotected, subpopulation with recent roots is easy to statistically document as a function of negative impacts on long term, local, indigenes.</p>
<p>The final thing you do is show all the Minnesotans who have and have not had direct contact with these people.  And show -their- views of Somalis.  As a simple percentage:</p>
<p>An internet article that opened with: &#8220;100% of those Minnesotan&rsquo;s who have had direct contact with Somalis don&rsquo;t have anything good to say about them.  Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Would be an -incredible- slap in the face to the diversity sleeze who want us all to think that only bigots and racists are against racial replacement.</p>
<p>That propaganda view, that isolation of us from each other, is what has to change and who better to start with than the microcosm case of the Minnesotans on the front line?</p>

		<p>The Somalis were initially brought to the Atlanta, Georgia area because it was thought that they would do better in a black metropolis. What happened, however, was that Somalis were shunned by American blacks, victimized and preyed upon by them. </p>
<p>In addition, Somalis are notorious welfare hounds. Wherever they go, the first place they hit is the local state welfare office.<br>
In Georgia, the purse is held by Republicans, so welfare programs are harder to access, don&rsquo;t pay as much in benefits and are cut off very quickly. </p>
<p>Contrast that with Maine and Minnesota where the purse is largely held by liberal Democrats. In Maine, the native French-Canadian population built and maintained a sizeable welfare state that was generous and meant to assist the poor amongst them. </p>
<p>In Minnesota, the Scandinavian, German and Jewish populations built their own welfare state - modeled on Northern European social democracy - which also provided generous and lavish benefits to the poor. </p>
<p>Washington state, on the Pacific Northwest Coast - with it&rsquo;s liberal base in Seattle and the historic Scandinavian, English and German ancestry has also been targeted by Somalis for settlement. </p>
<p>Somalis can smell a healthy Welfare State from thousands of miles away. It is rumored that they actually sent scouts to the Northern states to test the Welfare benefits. </p>
<p>When word got out that Maine, Minnesota and Washington provided generous benefits, the Somalis started to flock in. Almost overnight, Seattle, Minneapolis and Lewiston were swamped with Somalis clogging the waiting areas of welfare offices. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a nation in Africa to whose culture Somalis are perfectly suited, namely Somalia. If Minnesota is so terribly awful, why don&rsquo;t Somalis go back where they came from? Why is it the responsibility of whites to make things just so for every tribe of atavistic, third-world primitives who decide to invite themselves in?</p>

		<p>Has anyone noticed that blacks cannot even get along with each other? Yet we are pressured to accept and cater to their every whim? When all these horrible people take charge and run this country(which is inevitable because white people have lost their spine and refuse to fight for what is truly theirs) just watch how much faster this country will deteriorate. They have already taken away our right to freedom of speech and expression,(not allowing whites to use certain words)while they call us anything they feel like, yet they always have their hands out for anything free that they do not deserve. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to start forming militia&rsquo;s to enforce the constitution the way it was written to be and not how it is twisted around by minorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;There needs to be a serious theological debate in this country: Is immigration restriction compatible with Christianity? That is, might there be something about Christianity itself that renders followers incapable of grasping our nation&rsquo;s identity? Or is that Christianity, noble in principle, has been distorted by certain among its followers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the NT tells Christians to go out in the world and take in everyone through bringing them into the faith.  That&rsquo;s the problem.  That combined with the fact that religion is really a business and they need converts to continue business.  Federal grant money is a great scam since religious institutions shouldn&rsquo;t be receiving any Federal money for any purpose.  Remember, they don&rsquo;t pay taxes either.  But the most interesting thing I have read lately is on another current column here on Amren.  Go to the column on &#8220;Camp of Saints.&#8221;  Jean Raspall makes an interesting observation that the Christian ideal of a neighbor showing charity to his neighbor was extended to the entire world.  Of course, I think this is where the Christian logic of Europe is flawed because it was never a nationalist religion but one bent on world domination.  It always followed conquerors, after blessing their missions, and instituted itself as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Of course, the NT does admonish believers to spread the word worldwide, but I can&rsquo;t count the number of evangelists I have known of who have foreign ministries.  It makes them feel important.  They ignore the needy at home, even looking down on them as bums who ought to get a job, but then fly off to Africa or South America or Asia to help non-whites, even to the point of running adoption or sponsoring agencies.  </p>

<p>I might well be speaking way out of turn, especially on this a media organ of a foundation that probably has some sort of 501-c-x tax exempt status.  But I think most or all tax exempt foundations, trusts and institutions should be eliminated, and the deductiblity of personal donations to those institutions should be eliminated.  Churches included.  Synagogues included.  Mosques included.  </p>
<p>Aside from the fact that the tax exempt status/contribution deductibility duopoly I think is too much of a church-state intrusion, that compromise churches, what makes me gag is that so many of these &#8220;non profit&#8221; charities, church and secular, mainly exist as a non-governmental conduit to get people to enroll in government welfare programs.  So they don&rsquo;t have to pay taxes (other than the people working for the charities liable for personal income taxes), in their &#8220;great mission&#8221; to increase governments&rsquo; welfare expenses.</p>
<p>I happen to think that a lot of foundations and trusts are little more than tax evasion schemes.  Ever wonder why every seven-figure athlete has a foundation?  That&rsquo;s because the highest Federal marginal income tax rate is 35%, add in relevant states and cities, and it&rsquo;s higher.  Bill and Hillary Clinton run around the country begging for higher tax rates, while all their money goes through the tax-free Clinton foundation.</p>

		<p>I lived in Minneapolis for more than a decade.  I attended Minneapolis Community and Technical College, before transferring to the U of M.  MCTC prides itself in the diversity of the students.  Women wearing the Burka were common.  I met, or more accurately, encountered many Somali people.</p>
<p>The intro classes for the science and math majors, that I took, were probably 25% African.  They were gone after that.  There were never more than two or three black faces in any math or science class, beyond the most basic.  All of them were of the home grown variety.  There were no blacks in any of my science or math courses at the U of M.</p>
<p>The sad fact is, the recent African immigrants that I encountered, at MCTC, were very polite and respectful.  You could recognize them by their Cosby like sweaters and awkwardness.  </p>
<p>The natives ended their wide eyed innocence about the U.S., and the reality of competing with whites ended their hopes.  The goofy sweater made way for gangster wear after a semester or two.  I&rsquo;m glad I moved out of that city.  A lot of wonderful placed are going to look like Detroit in the next 15 years.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity is right about foundations being tax evasion schemes.  Foundations like those of Ford and Bill Gates only have to spend 5% of their money on &#8220;charity&#8221; in any given year.  In the meantime they are free to invest their money as they please, and there are many sidedoors through which money can be taken out as desired.  The LA Times did a series on the Gates foundation that revealed that they were giving money to a Seattle group that helps people victimized by mortgage scams, while simultaneously investing in the company that was doing the scamming.</p>
