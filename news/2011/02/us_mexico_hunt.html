<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/16/suspects-sought-fatal-shooting-ice-special-agent/">U.S., Mexico Hunt Killers of ICE Special Agent</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, February 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. law enforcement agencies are working closely with Mexican authorities in an investigation into the shooting Tuesday afternoon of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent killed when he and his partner were attacked by unknown assailants on a highway 230 miles north of Mexico City.</p>
<p>Special Agent Jaime Zapata, who was detailed to ICE&rsquo;s attache office at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City from his post in Laredo, Texas, was mortally wounded during the daylight attack, which occurred in the northern state of San Luis Potosi on Mexico&rsquo;s major highway between Mexico City and Monterrey.</p>
<p>During the 2:30 p.m. attack near the town of Santa Maria Del Rio, a second unnamed ICE special agent also assigned to attache office in Mexico City was shot twice in the leg. He has been transported back to the United States and is in stable condition.</p>
<p>According to U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities, the two agents were northbound on the four-lane federal highway in a blue Chevrolet Suburban when they stopped at what appeared to be a military checkpoint. It was then that unknown assailants opened fire on the agents.</p>
<p>No motive for the shooting has been established, although it is known that Mexican drug smugglers covet the type of truck the agents were driving and have attacked and killed others to steal them. The agents were on routine business at the time of the attack and not involved in an investigation, the authorities said.</p>
<p>Mexican military officers said they had no checkpoints in the area. San Luis Potosi police said the agents&rsquo; bullet-ridden Suburban was found off to the side of the highway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Mexican government condemned what it called &#8220;this serious act of violence,&#8221; and expressed &#8220;solidarity with the government of the United States and the families of the persons who were attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement released by the Mexican Office of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs said federal authorities in that country, in coordination and support of state authorities, are making the &#8220;necessary investigations to clarify the events and bring the guilty parties to justice.&#8221;</p>

		<p>End prohibition and deaths like these will greatly diminish. Others will die, of course - a far smaller number, and by their own hand. Ending prohibition will kick the chair out from under Mexican drug cartels and Afghan drug warlords right quick. I don&rsquo;t use the stuff myself and don&rsquo;t care for many who do. But I&rsquo;d rather have those US agents alive now and prohibition ending is the stupid simple way to lessen the death of US agents. </p>

		<p>The gangs will continue to get bolder as the US continues to deteriorate financially, militarily, and socially.  The intensity and numbers of violent incidents they&rsquo;re involved with against US citizens in Mexico and the US are accelerating at a much faster pace than even 10 years ago.  </p>
<p>With civilian riots in Mexico now emerging into the picture and armed attacks on border agents increasing, it&rsquo;s obvious to most sincere analysts the entire society is reaching a kind of crescendo where it&rsquo;s about to hit critical mass in the foreseeable future.</p>

		<p>When is Washington going to wake up and realize that the violent, corrupt country south of our border is neither a &#8220;friend&#8221; nor a &#8220;Partner?&#8221; Would they refer to Iran in those terms? Mexico is no different from that terrorist country across the world, yet our troops are there fighting for their people while Americans are left at the mercy of Mexico. Now we&rsquo;ve had another death, this time a government official, and the wounding of another. Neither the White House or Homeland Security has said a word about the many Americans that have been murdered during the years of the invasion. Maybe this will finally wake them up enough to seal the border, deport illegals and pretend Mexico doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I would do about this growing threat to the American population, whites especially.</p>
<p>1. Round up and deport all illegal immigrants by force. If that means expelling 40 million invaders, so be it. For those who resist, then use any and all force necessary, including deadly force.</p>
<p>2. Execute all illegals in jail for violent crimes against Americans, drug trafficking, terrorism, or human smuggling by firing squads or hanging. Execute summarily any illegal aliens who are members of these foreign gangs or caught committing violent crimes. execute any illegal alien smuggling drugs or weapons into the country as an enemy guerrilla. It&rsquo;s time to treat them for what they really are, enemy insurgents.</p>
<p>3. Seal off the border with Mexico, and step up armed patrols along that border, the oceans and the airspace. Interdict everyone trying to sneak into the county. If caught being in the nation, imprison them then expel them. Take DNA and fingerprints and enter them into a data base. Caught again, they will be subject to even more severe punishment or even execution if they turn out to be members.</p>
<p>4. Require citizenship to be checked for anyone going to a hospital, opening any sort of bank account, applying for a driver&rsquo;s license or apply for a job. Severe punishments for those who hire illegal aliens by heavy fines and jail time too. Ditto for anyone who helps illegals evade the law or steal citizens identities too. Check citizenship whenever police have contact with people, if they are not citizens illegally, immediately turn them over for expulsion or in the case of criminals, execution.</p>
<p>5. Make it impossible for illegals to obtain housing or education public or private.</p>
<p><br>
6. Immediate revocation of all welfare benefits illegals get.</p>
<p>7. Deny illegal any legal standing to sue, to receive damages or the legal rights citizens have. In other words, they should not be afforded the legal protection of the Bill of Rights or other legal protections citizens have. If they are caught committing crimes here, they will get no trial, they will get punished immediately.</p>
<p>8. Immediate end to birthright citizenship. In other words, babies born here will not be granted citizenship by default. If the parents are illegal, the child is an illegal as well.</p>
<p>9. Citizens will be legally immune from killing, harming or otherwise committing violence against illegals when they and their loved ones&rsquo; lives and well being are threatened by illegals. In other words, citizens should not be prosecuted if they kill or injure illegal aliens when acting in self defense or  protecting their property.</p>
<p>10. If necessary, invade Mexico, destroy the cartels and the ruling families who rule the country, and take over a belt along our border as a security zone. Disarm the country and run it under permanent martial law, with harsh punishment for anyone who creates any trouble.</p>

		<p>My drug of choice is beer. I have said for years that all of the illegal drugs cause fewer health problems and deaths to others than alcohol   &mdash;  YET   &mdash;  alcohol is legal and heroin is not. How many people know that heroin, cocaine and opium were legal in America until about 1918. In those days doctors practiced what was called &#8220;blood letting&#8221;. If you went to the doctor with problems he would say that you had bad blood and drain a pint or two out of you. Naturally, after you left his office and went to the local drugstore you could feel better by getting some cocaine or heroin to put in your coffee. This was cutting into doctor&rsquo;s profits. The American Medical Association lobbied congress for years trying to get cocaine and heroin made illegal.They finally succeeded with the passage of The Harrison Drug Control Act in 1918.</p>
