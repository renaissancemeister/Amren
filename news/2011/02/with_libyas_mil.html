			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Steers, Huffington Post, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The security chief in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi announced his resignation on Thursday, voicing his support for the opposition in a video aired by Al Arabiya TV.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Huwaidi became the latest in a wave of defections among members of the Libyan military refusing to order or carry out violence against their own countrymen. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Gaddafi isn&rsquo;t solely dependent on national military forces, which Byman said he has long sought to divide against itself by means of coercion and favoritism. The Libyan head of state can also rely on local-level tribal militias, which are hardly the equal of a conventional army but have been gaining strength for years and are expected to fight for Gaddafi even if the military turns on his regime.</p>
<p>Gaddafi has also unleashed foreign mercenaries against the opposition, according to new reports detailing African fighters roaming the streets and opening fire on citizens in Benghazi and the Libyan capital of Tripoli.</p>
<p>Fred Abrahams, a special adviser for Human Rights Watch said he can confirm those reports. &#8220;African fighters were brought in because Gaddafi fears Libyan forces in the police and army will not open fire on their brothers and sisters,&#8221; Abrahams said. &#8220;The defections of police and military in the east prove that he was right in that assumption. He can rely on mercenaries to do the dirty work that Libyans will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch has not released estimates regarding the number of mercenaries in Libya, but there are unconfirmed claims of thousands of foreign fighters. Abrahams said his organization has confirmed the presence of mercenaries flown in from African states including Chad, Niger and Sudan. Gaddafi has supported rebel groups in each of those countries.</p>
<p>According to Al Jazeera, pamphlets have been circulated to mercenary recruits from Guinea and Nigeria, offering foreign fighters $2,000 per day to quell the Libyan unrest.</p>
<p>Reports speculate that mercenaries are primarily targeting the uprising in the eastern part of the country, and witnesses also report mercenaries in Tripoli and around the western district of Zawiya.</p>
<p>A Libyan citizen living in the U.S. told The Huffington Post that his brother, a Libyan living in Tripoli, has seen armed foreigners taking control of the streets.</p>

		<p>No telling how this unrest will go. It could yield  progress and democratic reforms, or it could produce a fanatical Islamic reaction like that which took over Iran. </p>
<p>And how far will it spread?</p>
<p>Most intriguing question is whether the example will set aflame the Moslem masses living in Europe. This could ignite the European civil war.</p>

		<p>The Black mercenaries are useful idiots pure &amp; simple. Gaddafi&rsquo;s ideology is Arab supremacism and Africa-oriented. Of all Muslim leaders, Gaddafi &amp; Saddam were against Muslim imperialist al Qaida and considering that anti-al Qaida/pro-Israel govts also have been ousted in Egypt &amp; Tunisia, it seems that oil-rich Gulf Arab states who fund al Qaida are responsible for both Gulf Wars as well as these uprisings.</p>

<p> I wonder if this is what Obama meant when he said he wanted a civilian force equal to our military! Look at what&rsquo;s happening - Mexicans and God knows who else are swarming across our southern border, Africans [ Muslims ] are being brought over by the planeload and &#8216;scattered&rsquo; amoung White Christian areas.<br>

		<p>So it looks like the AFL-CIO had been in Cairo (and I don&rsquo;t know where else) signing up people, taking dues, promising change.  I am glad to see despots loose power, but this injection of the American Unions into the fray seems to be provocation by a private U.S. political entity.  The weird thing is that the AFL-CIO is exporting Socialism in order to make profits for itself.  Now that is irony.  Only America could come up with such a perverse foreign export.</p>

		<p>One thing that should be obvious to anyone who isn&rsquo;t a complete fool is that there is a serious coordinated effort being made to take over the middle east and north africa.  There is nothing spontaneous about any of this.  And the fact that they can challenge such hardcore dictators as Kaddafi show that they are powerful indeed.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is how quiet they kept it right up to the events in egypt.  Obviously, the militaries of all these countries, is involved.  For such a large conspiracy, no one blabbed.  That takes some serious mojo, or cash&hellip;.probably both.</p>
<p>So&hellip;who&rsquo;s behind it.  What are they planning if they win.  What will be the consequences if they lose.</p>
<p>Why is the US involved?</p>

		<p>Duran Dahl is correct, non English first language troops WILL be used against White American citizens and Obama will be the one to order it next year. BUT! #2 anon is not correct in that his comment &#8220;COULD produce fanatical islamic reaction&#8221; #2 Anon you should know that there is no other form of islam BUT fanatical, violent, bloodthirsty and barbaric islam. There is no islam but islam and it is sharia. I wonder if those mercenaries could be hired to clear up our muslim problem in America.</p>

		<p>To those on here who have warned that the threats by government to place the country under martial law will mean we all will be oppressed by government, unable to do anything but obey government&rsquo;s every whim, let me say that these latest successful uprisings prove what I have written before is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>I maintained that no government on earth could oppress an entire nation that has an armed population with martial law unless the population does nothing and allows it. </p>
<p>But we have several incidents here in a short period of time where UNARMED civilians have toppled their governments by sheer weight of numbers, representing an overwhelming force.  </p>
<p>As in the Balkans, Libyan army units, including tanks, were overwhelmed and their equipment confiscated by the civilian rebels.  News footage showed many AK 47&rsquo;s in the hands of civilians, and tanks were being driven up and down the streets, manned also by civilians.  Ghadafi had his planes blow up ammo dumps to deny the rebels supplies, but he couldn&rsquo;t get them all and they were raided and stripped bare.</p>
<p>The next time somebody expresses his/her fear that invoking  martial law would be too powerful to overcome, they would do well to understand that the combined forces of the military, police and National Guard in any country with an armed population, would be no match for millions of citizens who are armed to the teeth, so I say to all global governments, here and now, if you have any designs to suspend freedom of movement and install any kind of illegal police state, it would behoove you  to drop your arrogance long enough to take a closer look at what even unarmed civilians can do.</p>

		<p>Gaddhafi has always struck me as rather the Castro of the Middle East; definitely a commie with a softness for the darker races. Including Obama   &mdash;   Gaddhafi and Obama seem to have some strange rapport. Obama didn&rsquo;t even mention the dictator&rsquo;s name when condemning the violence.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Libyans finally were pushed over the edge by the Tunisia and Egypt revolutions. The common Libyans also, like Americans and unlike Cubans, seem to have kept their guns.</p>
<p><i>When there is a white insurrection in the US, the authorities will definitely use non-white troops against us, foreign or domestic. Bank on it.</i></p>
<p>Agreed. Hint: there are millions of illegal alien Hispanics here, and they are disproportionately young men. I wouldn&rsquo;t put the U.S. government past simply bribing MS-13 to cause mayhem.</p>

		<p>Gadaffi has done a lot of silly things in his time, but hiring black African mercenaries to gun down ethnic Libyans (who are dark caucasians and privately hold dim views of blacks), is probably thr silliest thing he has ever done.<br>
   This fact alone has signed his death warrant.</p>

<p>I think any reasonable, intelligent person should be able to look at this and realize why immigration and diversity are so destructive. When it gets right down to it, most people don&rsquo;t won&rsquo;t to massacre their own people. But foreigners aren&rsquo;t nearly so reluctant.</p>

		<p> Very bad tactical move to bring in African mercenary fighters to help quell the popular uprising.It further aggravates the antipathy of a lot of Libyans,like other Arabic people,have to black Africans and could be one of the key factors that accelerates Gaddhafis downfall and the intensity of the public uprising.<br>
Of course the outside media wont report it that way.<br>
  The last few speeches Gaddhafi has made seem like he has completely lost his marbles and he is rambling diatribes are akin to Hitler in his bunker at the Battle of Berlin with his support all around  rapidly crumbling.<br>
 Unsure where this is all heading but at least the downfall of this despot who was responsible for many terrorism outrages like the Lockerbie bombing must be a good thing anyway.  </p>

Are these incidents going to produce a new flood of North African refugees pouring outward into Europe (and North America)?  Another excuse for us to &#8220;reach out&#8221; and open our hearts and wallets?  (Not to mention our countries.)</p>
<p>With all the endless chaos and turmoil that are endemic to African and Moslem societies, eventually, there will be more of them living here than there!  And then, we will be just like them:  here will be just like there, no difference.</p>
<p>Sorry! We cannot absorb their refugees and unfortunates forever. We need to look out for ourselves,  just as they will have to look after themselves and take care of their own. There is plenty of room  in the large Arab world   &mdash;  -  they don&rsquo;t need to come  here.</p>

		<p>The video footage and accounts of armed Black mercs slaughtering the local population will come out no doubt. That CNN will choose not to air them is a certainty. I imagine the images will look very much like NO during Katrina, only far worse. I wouldnt wish this on any country, and no doubt the mercenaries will scamper out and into southern Europe posing as refugees once the opportunity for mayhem has passed. </p>

		<p>How long the Libyan leader is going to be able to hold out in Tripoli is anybody&rsquo;s guess, but if he does so for an extended period of time corridors of arms supplies will open on the Egyptian border on the east, possibly Sudan in the south, possibly Tunisia in the northwest, also the Libyan coastline in the north, arming thousands of other dissidents.  It looks like forces are closing in from every direction. Time is on the side of the insurgents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how arrogant and murderous these black killers will feel when they&rsquo;re surrounded by insurgents, forced to either shoot themselves or surrender.  Being black, they&rsquo;ve probably made numerous stupid decisions in their lives, but the one to volunteer to kill innocent civilians will be their last stupid mistake.  To face the relatives of murdered civilians has got to be the worst nightmare of any war criminal.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m concerned that a horde of Libyans may flee to the U.S. in the aftermath of this uprising, I&rsquo;m even more alarmed that the Bantu mercenaries brought in by Qaddafi will ALSO try to seek asylum in the United States, before it&rsquo;s all said and done.</p>
<p>How? Easy. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll claim they were duped by Qaddafi into accepting money for what they thought was simply guarding Libya&rsquo;s oil fields. They&rsquo;ll say they had no idea of what they were getting into. Of course, they&rsquo;ll say that they face reprisal from the Libyan populace for shooting at unarmed civilians, and will be slaughtered unless they seek asylum in the United States. Of course, the MFIC, Obama will grant them asylum unconditionally.</p>
<p>There is precedent for the U.S. taking in another country&rsquo;s criminals - the 1980 Mariel boatlift from Cuba, when Fidel Castro opened his jail cells and emptied them of Cuba&rsquo;s criminals. The Carter regime took them in with no questions asked.   </p>

		<p>Perhaps Obama can send over some union thugs, ACORN members, and some of his buddies from Detroit to help out his buddy Gadaffi. This will help to raise the unemployment figure. Then again, he might send over some illegal immigrants who will do the work the Libyan soldiers won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it will be a problem, Middle Eastern countries do not tolerate blacks. They aren&rsquo;t going to coddle them and let them create little ghettoes, in fact those mercenaries will be in fear for their lives when Gaddafi gets booted and havoc reigns.</p>
