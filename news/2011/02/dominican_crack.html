<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2224843&amp;nid=836">Dominican Crackdown on Haitian Migrants Sows Fear</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), February 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Dominican Republic has deported thousands of illegal immigrants in recent weeks, sowing fear among Haitians living in the country and prompting accusations its government is using a cholera outbreak as a pretext for a crackdown.</p>
<p>In the largest campaign in years to target Haitians living illegally in the Dominican Republic, soldiers and immigration agents have been setting up checkpoints and conducting neighborhood sweeps, detaining anyone without papers and booting them from the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Haitians live at least part-time in the Dominican Republic, enduring frequent discrimination and the constant fear of being deported. A cholera epidemic in Haiti that has killed at least 4,000 people and sickened 200,000 has made matters worse.</p>
<p>Dominican officials eased border controls and halted deportations for humanitarian reasons after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake near Port-au-Prince that killed an estimated 316,000 people and devastated the already impoverished nation. But right at the one-year anniversary of the quake, the deportations resumed  &mdash;  with greater enforcement than has been seen since 2005.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 people have been handcuffed and sent across the border in the past three weeks, including some legal residents who were simply caught without their documents, according to migrants and advocates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The government denies that any legal residents have been deported. Dominican immigration chief Sigfrido Pared defended the deportations, saying his country cannot be an escape valve for Haitians fleeing extreme poverty and political instability.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimated before the earthquake that some 600,000 Haitians were living illegally in the Dominican Republic, which has a total population of nearly 10 million. Dominican authorities say that number has since grown to 1 million, most of them there illegally.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very easy for some countries or some organizations to criticize the situation in the Dominican Republic,&#8221; Pared said. &#8220;No (other) country in the world has a border with Haiti. No country in the world has a Haitian problem like the Dominican Republic has.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far there have only been about 300 known cholera cases in the Dominican Republic  &mdash;  with one fatality, a Haitian migrant believed to have contracted the disease back home. Even in Haiti, the disease has slowed in recent weeks amid a nationwide treatment and education campaign.</p>
<p>However infectious disease specialists warn that cholera could still rebound in Haiti, and the Dominican Health Ministry says it can&rsquo;t afford to take any chances</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s [cholera] a threat to our country,&#8221; said Secondino Matos, a 50-year-old truck driver. &#8220;They (Haitians) are our brothers  &mdash;  but not the illegal ones. This country is drowning in them already.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some activists allege that cholera is just an excuse, and the mass deportations are actually driven by racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry and Migration Office said the operation is focused on Haitians who are coming into the country illegally, but there are tens of thousands in the country with no papers so it&rsquo;s often not possible to know who is a recent arrival and who has been there for years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition to the deportations, Haitians say the crackdown is making their lives difficult in other ways: Bus and taxi drivers are now reluctant to transport them because authorities have been impounding vehicles carrying illegal migrants and handing out $270 fines. The increased border security not only makes it harder to cross but also has driven up the price of bribing Dominican border guards and migrant smugglers&rsquo; fees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Darker-skinned Haitians are frequently discriminated against, and the Dominican Republic denies citizenship to people of Haitian ancestry born in the country by claiming they are &#8220;in transit&#8221;  &mdash;  even when many have been there for generations.</p>

		<p>When you look at an overhead photo of Hispaniola you immediately can tell which half is Hait - the desolute, desert half.  The green, lush half is the Dominican Republic.  The Domincan government is doing what all governments should be doing:  keeping disease ridden, criminally inclined, potential public charges out of the country.  It is called looking after your own.  Despite being poor and largely backward even the Dominicans are smart enough to know something our own leaders do not:  Haitians are not a valuable asset to one&rsquo;s nation.  Like any invasive species they merely destroy.  Go Domincans!</p>

<p>Well, I imagine Haiti has a bigger Haiti problem.  In all seriousness, imagine if a high ranking US immigration official said &#8220;Mexican problem&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Good for the Dominican Republic, too bad we don&rsquo;t do the same. I&rsquo;m hard pressed to think of anywhere on earth that the Haitians would prove to be an asset. Here is a group of people that took land that could support four crops a year and turned it into an environmental nightmare. Two groups of people may inhabit the same land, but there are distinctly different levels of performance. </p>
<p>&#8220;Haiti has 9 million inhabitants, the Dominican Republic, 9.6 million. Life expectancy is 61 years in Haiti, 73.7 years in the Dominican Republic. Literacy rate (over 15 years old) is 52.9% in Haiti, 87% in the Dominican Republic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haiti&rsquo;s per capita GDP (PPP) was $1,300 in 2008, or less than one-sixth of the Dominican figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain much-needed medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.&#8221; (Sounds like hospitals in Arizona, California, and Texas). </p>
<p>&#8220;In 2005 Dominican President Leonel Fernández criticized collective expulsions of Haitians as having taken place &#8220;in an abusive and inhuman way&#8221;. After a UN delegation issued a preliminary report stating that it found a profound problem of racism and discrimination against people of Haitian origins, Dominican Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso issued a formal statement denouncing it and asserting that &#8220;Our border with Haiti has its problems, this is our reality and it must be understood. It is important not to confuse national sovereignty with indifference, and not to confuse security with xenophobia&#8221;.</p>

		<p>As a sovereign nation the Dominican Republic has every right to secure there country and border as they see fit.  However just like the two faced Republican developer, industrialized agricultural types in the U.S. that love illegal cheap labor and that includes are so called pals that just needed a little landscaping work done.  So too goes the Dominican Republic, they love those Haitian servants that work for next to nothing.  In are fight to the control our border we need to call out and embarrass those that do this every chance we get, especially those who claim to be on the right.</p>

		<p>The time is long past when over-crowded, poverty-stricken countries could dump their excess unproductive population onto another country.  Worldwide, we are simply out of room.  Everywhere on Earth, we are already too crowded.  Even the Great USA is having trouble obtaining suitable supplies of energy, commodities, landfill space, clean water, etc. for its growing population.  National debt is skyrocketing, and taxes are rising as we try to support nearly 100 million, low-educated, less productive people and their many, many children.  California will be the first to go, followed by maybe Michigan or Illinois?  </p>
<p>We are full, and all other nations are full.  Today, each nation must provide for their OWN citizens.  Either lower your population, or suffer the consequences of your own ignorance and irresponsibility.  </p>

		<p>Back in 1937, in response to information regarding Haitians stealing cattle and crops from Dominican residents of the borderlands, President Trujillo ordered a crackdown and expulsion of all Haitians.</p>
<p>If not for this act of necessity, the DR would not be half the country it is today.  It probably would have been overrun and destroyed by Haitians long ago.</p>

<p>And it always gets me how articles like this suggest that there&rsquo;s something outrageous about attempting to enforce the law.</p>

<p>NOT a crackdown. A massacre of mind-boggling proportions. The Parsley Massacre. About 25,000 Haitians killed in one week? This figure is apparently NOT inflated.</p>
<p>And all these other posters are absolutely right. The Dominican wants to keep their nation THEIRS. Hard to understand for some, but there it is.</p>
<p>&#8220;only been about 300 known cholera cases in the Dominican Republic &mdash; with one fatality&#8221;</p>
<p>ONLY about 300 and only about ONE. I am glad! ONLY about 300 and ONLY about one. I am glad. I speak sarcastically. I am sure that ONE is glad too.</p>
<p>If you let the Haitian in, you will just make the Dominican Republic over time another Haiti!</p>

		<p> Poor Dominican Republic, so far from God so close to Haiti! Trujillo was an awful tyrant but he did stop the environmental degradation and Haitification of his country for a time. Most of the Dominican Republic&rsquo;s ruling elites are lighter skinned mixed race people, who despise and distrust the darker skinned Haitians. There is no liberal-minority coalition (like the U.S.) among the ruling classes, only autocratic mixed race elite.  Most of the dark blacks are the descendants of Haitian immigrants. They are not an insignificant part of the population. Places like the Dominican Republic are a true model of what a racially mixed, overpopulated, environmentally damaged, post-industrial; America will look like in the next century. Forget the Kumbaya nonsense of contemporary liberal Dom and their &ldquo;great dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually, before the mass slaughter of first Whites, and then Mulattos (leaving only pure-blood Africans), Haiti had advanced culture, including opera, theater, beautiful estates, parks, churches, schools, public buildings, and a very successful and profitable economy. </p>
<p>After the Africans took over, everything was destroyed, exactly like what happened in Africa after the European colonial powers left, and exactly what happened in Detroit.  Africans not only cannot create a viable society   &mdash;   they can&rsquo;t even maintain one that is handed to them on a platter.  Even with massive constant financial aid, encouragement, and support from Whites (i.e., Head Start, welfare, section 8 housing, affirmative action, etc.), Africans still fail. </p>

		<p>Dominicans here in NY are always complaining about losing &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhoods to evil whites that build them for them. In my old neighborhood, the Lower East Side, the Puerto Ricans (and some Dominicans) would hold protests and demand they be given more free and subsidized housing in one of the trendiest, most expensive neighborhoods in the City. Sure I have to pay 2 grand for a tiny one bedroom apartment, but let them all have free apartments that come out of my pocket in brutal NYC taxes..</p>
<p>There was a Broadway play called &#8220;The Heights&#8221; fretting about the end of the Dominican occupation of the Manhattan Neighborhood of Washington Heights, or at least that is what my liberal parents told me it was about. It has only been a Dominican neighborhood since the 1970s or so but they act as they sailed here in the 1600s and built it themselves.</p>

<p>Two &#8216;Haitian Nationals&rsquo; living in Atlanta were arrested for the death of a 4 (yes, four) year old girl due to extreme alcohol poisoning. Her blood alcohol level was three times that of the legal limit for an adult. Officials are pursuing murder charges, as indications are that it was intentional. Two other children were taken from the home and put in custody of Family Services.</p>
<p>The man was her father and the woman was her aunt. The mother was living in Haiti with 4 other children. </p>

		<p>Ordinarily, there are a lot of candid, intelligent and sincere things in these comments (the Kwame Kilpatrick stories, for instance; the guy should be run out of town by &#8220;his people&#8221; - and frankly, knowing a fair number of Black Detroiters, most of them want to do exactly that).</p>
<p>I have to take issue with aj about the Dominicans and Haitians in NY. In the outer boroughs (Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn) the Dominican Immigrants and Haitians are a hell of a lot harder working than from any ethnic group or immigrant population by a long shot. I live in a (getting whiter by the day) building where there are about half-Hatian/Dominican families. Almost without exception, the heads of the families work at least two jobs (the guy across the hall from me works as a self-employed carpenter, with proper license, every day, including Saturdays, and drives a cab at night to help support his son (who got a scholarship to study mechanical engineering at MIT - and maintains a GPA of 3.9, before you make any assumptions about affirmative action; the kid used to fix cars out on the street outside when he was in the 10th grade, so I&rsquo;ve seen him pull it off for years).</p>
<p>while the Dominicans are not quite as hard-working or dedicated as the Haitians, for the most part, they still work harder than any other group, insist on good grades and contributions to the household from their kids, and are largely conservative Catholics. </p>
<p>Also, the prevailing dream is to get out of the cramped city and get a house in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Not really surprising that when they manage to get the hell out of Haiti or the DR, they&rsquo;re pretty motivated to make the most of it. </p>
<p>Do I really need to mention that they think native-born American blacks and Puerto Ricans are lazy, decadent, etc. They do (again, just my experience).</p>

		<p>What Ben sees is - I think - a &#8220;cream of the crop&#8221; phenomenon. The Dominicans and Haitians that he&rsquo;s observing are the one who were smart and hardworking enough to make it here legally. Which translate to most likely being smart enough not to have completely unrealistic expectations for themselves. They&rsquo;re working like sled dogs now so their kids will have a better life.</p>
<p>But these folks are very likely to be statistical blips,and another phenomenon known as &#8220;reversion to the mean&#8221; will raise it&rsquo;s ugly head in a generation or three. Sure,Mama and Papa got here the hard way and earned every nickel honestly. And they made sure their kids were raised to do the same. But when looking at this,never forget that Mama and Papa ( or Mere and Pere ) are the exceptions to the Rule of IQ. Even if their kids are as smart as they are,the kids of their kids aren&rsquo;t as likely to be as smart.</p>
