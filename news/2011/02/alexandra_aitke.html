			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gethin Chamberlain and Patrick Sawer, Telegraph (London), February 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Following a spectacular ceremony near Amritsar  &mdash;  organised at such short notice that her father, Jonathan Aitken, the disgraced former Cabinet minister, and her mother were unable to attend  &mdash;  the former society hell-raiser declared her intention to live a life of humble simplicity with &#8220;the most beautiful man I&rsquo;ve ever seen&#8221;. </p>
<p>But while most cross-cultural marriages are likely to bring their own particular strains and difficulties, the union of Alexandra Aitken and Inderjot Singh may have to bear more than most. </p>
<p>Already, some of Mr Singh&rsquo;s relatives have stepped in to denounce the marriage as contravening Sikh traditions, saying that it threatens to dilute the family&rsquo;s bloodline. </p>
<p>Members of his family have also cast doubt on Alexandra&rsquo;s widely publicised claim that her husband is a member of a devout Sikh warrior sect and that dozens of holy men left their caves to attend the wedding. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are question marks over quite how religious Mr Singh actually is, with friends coming forward to point out that he used to be quite happy living a party lifestyle. </p>
<p>Alexandra Aitken&rsquo;s marriage to Mr Singh is the culmination of a tortuous journey, from party girl to yoga devotee and Sikh convert, that has seen her dabble in Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and Kabbalah along the way. </p>
<p>She told how their wedding was attended by 150 holy men who took the unusual step of leaving the &#8220;caves&#8221; where they spend much of their time meditating. Alexandra, 30, who, after her conversion, calls herself Harvinder Kaur Khalsa, described her husband as a pious man who spends much of his time helping to feed and clothe the poor. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She also proudly asserts that 27-year-old Mr Singh is a member of the Nihang, an armed order of the Sikh faith which she calls &#8220;the SAS of the religion&#8221;. </p>
<p>The reality, however, may be more complex. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Mr Singh&rsquo;s parents appear to be happy with their son&rsquo;s choice of bride, not everyone in the family shares their delight. </p>
<p>His uncle, Nacchator Singh, said: &#8220;I was decidedly against the marriage. It is the mixing of races and races should not be mixed.&#8221; </p>
<p>He claims Mr Singh has polluted their pure bloodline by marrying a British girl. </p>
<p>&#8220;No foreigner should marry a Punjabi. We had another foreign woman come and marry a boy here and she stayed for a couple of years and then left him and took a lot of money,&#8221; he said. There are fears Alexandra may soon tire of living amid India&rsquo;s poverty, contrasting as it does with her privileged upbringing. </p>
<p>He [Fateh Singh, a member of the Nihang] said: &#8220;His friends came to the wedding wearing the Nihang clothes but they are not Nihang either. And they don&rsquo;t live in caves. They all belong to good families.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The woman in question is either scamming the swarthy turbaned 3rd Worlder OR she is a sick, disturbed flake and is better off polluting the Sikhs than her own people and I understand the Sikhs not wanting this abomination either. I think it&rsquo;s a scam FOR ATTENTION &amp; DRAMA. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s obviously a spoiled misfit. India seems like a good place to export all the crackpots of the western world. And make them stay there, no coming back allowed. It&rsquo;s only fair that if India sends migrants out then they should accept immigrants from elsewhere on a one for one basis. I hope this sparks a trend; the less loonies we have here in the west the better off we&rsquo;ll be.  </p>

		<p>This is the story of a young White lady who had no guidance in her life. She was, and remains, lost.  Sadly, this is an all to often seen testament to current Western society.  We have no sense of who we are or where we are going, and so are not even able to give our children a sense of purpose. </p>

		<p>A Google &#8220;Image Search&#8221; for Alexandra Aitken produces: <br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/6lye5d8" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/6lye5d8</a></p>
<p>These images suggest a party girl existence, the shallowness of which may have launched a search for meaning in the exotic. The same impulse may have motivated Madonna&rsquo;s foray into Jewish mysticism. Paris Hilton, on the other hand, is shallowness incarnated.  No spiritual odyssey for her.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and predict that &#8220;A life of humble simplicity&#8221; will either:</p>
<p>Include amenities such as satellite television,air conditioning,and other refinements that most Indians wouldn&rsquo;t dare to even dream about. ( Including,to be sure,a comfortable income from <i>somewhere</i> ) Or-</p>
<p>this life of humble simplicity will last about 90 days before the blanket gets split and these two go on about their ways with out the burden of each other.</p>
<p>Seriously,can anyone picture this woman chopping wood to boil water for tea???? Or wringing the neck of a chicken,or even pumping up a bicycle tire?</p>

<p>However they are now separated.  </p>
<p>These types of marriages never last and one can safely assume the same shall be true with this crazed-hysterical liberal Alexandra Aitken woman.</p>

I agree with &#8220;Anonymous 1&#8221; and am seriously starting to convince myself that women should not have full rights.  I&rsquo;m not saying that it should be anything like Islam, but think back to the 1950&rsquo;s.  Women still technically have the same rights, but did not do certain things for being labeled a tramp or loose.  I don&rsquo;t know if their rights need to be diminished (just a little) or they need something else.</p>
<p>  One thing for sure, most women I have met either have no idea what they want or they just decide on the exact opposite on a whim with no rationale to back it up.  Example:  I want a man that is masculine but sensitive.  Assertive but compromising, etc. etc.  How many or women have heard a female friend say these paradoxes?  Why not short but tall&hellip;?</p>

<p>Let anyone in Once-great Britain try claiming that Alexandra Aitken has polluted her pure <i>White</i> bloodline by marrying Mr. Singh, and see how long they can stay out of jail.</p>
<p>As always, White people are the only ones forbidden to acknowledge their own race.<br>

<p>Oh dear, the same old story of the &#8216;party girl&rsquo; that just doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with herself (other than be an attention-seeker); looks like Islam is next for you love.</p>
<p>&#8220;His uncle, Nacchator Singh, said: &ldquo;I was decidedly against the marriage. It is the mixing of races and races should not be mixed.&rdquo; &#8220;</p>
<p>Looks like Uncle Nacchator is the brains of the operation here, he even said &#8216;decidedly&rsquo;, lucky Alexandra&rsquo;s British uncle didn&rsquo;t say similar!</p>
<p>Years ago I knew a (white) woman that married a Sikh doctor, she said he was a lovely chap&hellip;until they got married.<br>
Good luck Miss/Ms Aitken / Mrs Singh&hellip;you&rsquo;ll need it!</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s almost 30 and just spent the last two years in LA doing nothing but &#8220;yoga&#8221;. And now she&rsquo;s going to run off to Punjab. Has she ever been there? Does she even speak the language? She&rsquo;s just another spoiled brat rich kid playing at life. And this is just the latest flavor of the month. In another two years the &#8220;marriage&#8221; will be over and she&rsquo;ll be on to something else.</p>

		<p>For Alexandra Aitken,read Jemima Goldsmith,who became Jemima Khan when she married Pakistani cricketer turned politician Imran Khan.The spoilt daughter of an unpopular plutocrat,her marriage lasted about three weeks before she very publicly took up with movie star Hugh Grant.Expect more of the same from this attention seeking wastrellette.I fully sympathise with her disapproving in-laws,although had it been the other way round the Aitken family would probably face charges of incitement to racial hatred.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinne_Hofmann" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinne_Hofmann</a>  </p>
<p>She left for Africa intending to never return.  Her marriage to a primitive African tribesman didn&rsquo;t last, mainly because she kept trying to impose Western standards of housekeeping, entrepreurialism, and women&rsquo;s independance.</p>
<p>Like Corinne, Alexandra will return to the West once she tires of foreign culture. </p>

		<p>Its amazing, White women are the easiest women on earth to have. Whenever they marry into another culuture they dress like the culture, talk like them, eat like them etc,. its ridiculous! Any kind of man from the Amazon Jungles to the streets of Detroit can have a White woman. What gives?</p>

		<p>To Seneca the Younger:<br>
Women have no monopoly on interracial foolishness and &#8220;loose&#8221; sexual behavior. What I see every day in San Francisco is massive numbers of young white men with Chinese girlfriends (a strange preference for childlike, undeveloped bodies and squeaky little voices).</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s rights that need to be &#8220;diminished&#8221; instead, re: their sexual behavior, or there won&rsquo;t be a white race in a couple of generations. Actually, I think racial separation is the only way to avoid these problems in both sexes. </p>
<p>That &#8220;tramp&#8221; behavior that offends you is the same behavior women have had to put up with in men for thousands of years. Not pretty, is it? </p>
<p>If &#8220;most women&#8221; you meet have the characteristics you describe, maybe it&rsquo;s time to try a different social scene. Most women I hang out with are intelligent and rational.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it strange? Western men will take more care with the blodlines of their dogs than they will with their own children. </p>
<p>Her father is a witless goon: &#8220;Inderjot has made my daughter blissfully happy. They are wonderfully happy together and I rejoice in that,&#8221; he said. It&rsquo;s not surprising that he has done such a poor job raising Alexandra.</p>
<p>Finally, I am with Seneca(poster 12), women should not have full rights. However, neither should all men. How many white men have fetched themselves an asian girl? Exactly. Now I don&rsquo;t want to sound odd, but I for one would like to try Platos Philosopher Kingdom.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wow, and they call us racists? India is the most racist country on earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hold on, let&rsquo;s not label people &#8220;racist&#8221; for simply wanting to preserve their own bloodlines. My brother married an Indian girl recently, and despite the polite, dignified welcomes that we received from the in-laws in India, the pain in their eyes was palpable as my brother&rsquo;s father in law officially gave his daughter away as per Hindu ritual at the end of the wedding ceremony. Women were weeping (and i don&rsquo;t mean tears of joy either)  while men were silent and somber. My sister in law is a beautiful, intelligent and caring woman, and also an only child. I suspect the Indians at the ceremony, while courteous to the Western half, were silently thinking that a quality individual of their own bloodline was lost to the &#8220;other&#8221; forever. Can we really blame them for feeling betrayed when we know that she will mother half white kids and not the next generation of her own community?</p>

<p>Part travel book, part love story, An Indian Attachment tells of the two years Sarah Lloyd spent in rural India, in love with a placid, beautiful, opium-addicted Sikh.<br>
Living first in a remote mud-built Punjabi village, they later moved to be part of the impoverished community of a dubious holy man, where they lived in a minute, windowless, brick hut on around fifty pence a day. No other outsider has written so convincingly about life as the vast majority of Indians know it. </p>
<p>She should have read that first. Or even White Masai. Can&rsquo;t believe these people who are stupid enough to go live with these people in their huts.  Yeah, the wedding&rsquo;s really pretty, they get to wear lots of bright colors and they get their hands painted so nicely  &mdash;  you can get that done at a carnival, dummy.</p>
<p>I married a white guy from a second-world country, and it was bad enough.  This is inconceivable.</p>
