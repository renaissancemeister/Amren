			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Iain Hollingshead, Telegraph (London), February 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Outside McDonald&rsquo;s in Aldershot, Hampshire, &#8220;the home of the British Army&#8221;, the scene is more redolent of a street in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu. Two elderly women no taller than 4ft shuffle silently down the road, their thin shoulders covered by colourful blankets. Behind them a group of equally wizened men sporting a curious combination of Dhaka topis (a traditional Nepalese hat), and Puffa jackets, greet each other with smiles and cries of &#8220;Namaste&#8221;, their hands pressed together, their heads slightly bowed.</p>
<p>Nearby, Dave Chamberlain, is cranking up his sales patter on the &#8220;Five-a-day&#8221; grocery stall. &#8220;Susti, susti,&#8221; he calls out in Nepali. &#8220;Cheap cheap.&#8221; As a Nepalese woman approaches, he jokingly puts an empty basket on her head; she retaliates by punching him playfully on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love the Nepalese,&#8221; says Chamberlain. &#8220;They have great banter, they&rsquo;re really patriotic and they buy a lot of tomatoes. They&rsquo;re proper hagglers, and they don&rsquo;t always understand the concept of queuing. But still, we have a great laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone in Aldershot is so relaxed about the arrival of Nepalese following the 2009 campaign led by the actress Joanna Lumley. After memorably ambushing Phil Woolas, the then immigration minister, in a television studio, Miss Lumley&rsquo;s intervention was a key factor in forcing the government into abandoning rules that prevented members of the Gurkha Brigade who&rsquo;d retired before 1997 settling in Britain.</p>
<p>The campaign attracted widespread public support for the Gurkhas, who have been an integral part of the British Army for almost 200 years  &mdash;  Miss Lumley&rsquo;s father was an officer with the 6th Gurkha Rifles. They have lost more than 50,000 men in combat, and received 26 Victoria Crosses (13 to Gurkha soldiers and 13 to British soldiers serving with them).</p>
<p>Today, one in 10 of Aldershot&rsquo;s 90,000 residents hails from Nepal. Gerald Howarth, the local MP and a defence minister, recently raised the issue with David Cameron, claiming that public services are at risk of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>One surgery in his constituency has had to take on an extra GP after Nepalese incomers, many of them elderly and unwell, swelled its patient list from 6,000 to 9,000. Some 800 children with Nepali as their first language have arrived in the constituency and must be accommodated in schools. Overall, there has been a 280 per cent increase in Nepalese households in the past year, with 20 new people arriving every week.</p>
<p>The local authority, Rushmoor Borough Council, describes a one-off £120,000 grant, used to pay for two full-time translators, as &#8220;peanuts&#8221;  &mdash;  especially in the light of a £2.4 million funding cut to their budget.</p>
<p>Mr Howarth&rsquo;s intervention has unleashed a torrent of previously suppressed opinion, with 70 per cent of his constituents backing his decision to raise this sensitive issue at the highest level. On the website of the local newspaper, gethampshire.co.uk, one resident notes that it &#8220;reflects what very, very many people in Aldershot are saying under their breath&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly no shortage of anonymous grumbling, some of it bordering on racist. A posting on the Army Rumour Service website complains about Nepalese children thinking they are &#8220;living in a Jet Li film and having scraps at every opportunity&#8221; (a police report states that this is due to playground bullying). A taxi driver tells me, with barely concealed prejudice, about Nepalese men &#8220;spitting and p  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   in the street&#8221;. While other residents share tales of frail, elderly men rooting through rubbish bins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see Gerald Howarth&rsquo;s concerns,&#8221; says Major Tikendra Dal Dewan (retd), chairman of the British Gurkha Welfare Society. &#8220;But it is a shame that they have re-opened some negative comments in the community, diluting the good relationships we have been putting in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re bound to see more Nepalese faces in the town,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;They are more visible and like to go for a walk or a bus ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the town last week I saw only the most courteous and harmonious behaviour, with many people expressing support for the Gurkhas, who have had a base nearby since the 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone likes us,&#8221; said Muchhetra Gurung, 46, dressed impeccably in a blazer and tie. &#8220;They come up and say &#8216;hello&rsquo; and shake your hand.&#8221; Since leaving the Army in 2000 after 17 years of service, Gurung has set up home with his wife and son in Britain, establishing two &#8220;AM&#8221; Asian restaurants.</p>
<p>However, it is not people like Gurung  &mdash;  a relatively rare success story  &mdash;  who concern Gerald Howarth and the inhabitants of Aldershot. It is those Major Dewan calls &#8220;the old and bold&#8221;  &mdash;  who retired before 1997 and have arrived in the past year  &mdash;  who are less able to adapt.</p>
<p>In a tiny room at the Gurkha Army Ex-Servicemen&rsquo;s Organisation building, I found 50 or so huddled around a TV watching a Nepalese satellite channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many are told the wrong message about life in the UK,&#8221; says Gurung. &#8220;They&rsquo;re encouraged by family and friends to come here, and when they do, they find the reality a little different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the friendly atmosphere, it is difficult to see the appeal of this cramped room, especially for those who have left family behind or sold land to come here. And yet no one I spoke to regretted the decision. &#8220;The people here are very civilised and I like them very much,&#8221; says Prem Jung Shahi, 67, beaming from ear to ear. &#8220;I&rsquo;m trying to make friends but it is not easy. In the Army they taught us only how to strip a machine gun and how to kill the enemy; they did not teach us how to speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since arriving in December 2009, Shahi has taught himself by borrowing books from the library. He hopes to bring over his son and daughter soon.</p>
<p>And yet for every optimistic tale, there is also sad bewilderment. &#8220;I find Aldershot a very friendly town,&#8221; says Gyanendr Rai, 55. &#8220;But I nearly died after being shot in the Falklands war. I cannot work, I am in chronic pain. I get a small pension and no war injury compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He points at a Help for Heroes badge on his lapel. &#8220;I&rsquo;m a hero,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but no one helps me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue of pensions is raised again and again. The British Gurkha Welfare Society has been campaigning for years for pre-1997 veterans to receive an equal allowance to British soldiers (they currently receive only £2,150 per year, instead of £5,000). Settlement costs for ex-Gurkhas could run up to £400 million, while equalising pensions would cost only around £54 million.</p>
<p>In total there are 36,000 former Gurkhas: if their immediate families are included, then more than 100,000 Nepalese citizens are eligible to move to Britain. Since May 2009, the Government has issued more than 7,500 visas.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are too many cultural and language barriers here,&#8221; says Mahendra Lal Rai, the director of the Gaeso centre, and a third-generation Gurkha (his father lost an arm in the Second World War). He lowers his voice and points at the quiet huddle glued to the television. &#8220;If they are given equal pensions, many will go back home and live with dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is an argument that clearly irritates Gerald Howarth, who reacted with anger last week when the Gaeso chairman wrote to the Equality and Human Rights Commission to complain about his comments.</p>
<p>He counters: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like the implicit threat over pensions: &#8216;pay us more and we&rsquo;ll go back to Nepal&rsquo;. What am I meant to say to other servicemen? There&rsquo;s huge competition to become a Gurkha, and they signed up on a pension that bought them a decent standard of living at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howarth, like most people, says he has nothing but respect and affection for the Gurkhas. &#8220;I&rsquo;m so fond of them,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But this issue is emphatically about the numbers. This is not a land of milk and honey. And we cannot cope here. They have been sold a false prospectus.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lays the blame squarely on the fair shoulders of Joanna Lumley. &#8220;You have to be objective in politics,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And that campaign was a nakedly emotional tugging of the heartstrings. It completely failed to take into account what would happen afterwards.&#8221; Miss Lumley was not available for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Now that Aldershot is having to deal with the aftermath of her popular campaign, Howarth has shared some suitably objective solutions with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>One, inevitably, is more money to cope with the influx. Another is to convene a cross-government committee to examine the problem. While the third is to see if the widespread affection for Gurkhas  &mdash;  they always get the biggest cheer on Remembrance Sunday  &mdash;  can be capitalised on and other communities found to accommodate them.</p>
<p>At which point we shall see if the Big Society is sufficiently broad, and the affection for the Gurkhas sufficiently deep, to include welcoming them  &mdash;  not just on the battleground and the parade ground  &mdash;  but in our own backyard.<br/>

		<p>The English stil have a Ghurkha regiment and take in about 200 applicants per year. 200 taken out of about 20,000 that apply!</p>
<p>If the U.S. Army wants to swell the ranks with good troops, they need to form an American Foreign Legion and create a brigade [5,000 men] of Ghurkhas. Want to fight and good at doing so.</p>
<p>The infamous Japanese Colonel Tsuji rated the Ghurkha as being fourth on his list when ranking troops by fighting ability. Ahead of Americans, behind Russians.</p>
<p>Two other ethnic groups that could be formed into very good fighting forces an American Foreign Legion would be Afrikaner South Africans and Fijians. 5,000 troops each of the best personal.</p>

		<p>Everyone loves the Gurkhas although, in reality, they are simply foreign mercenaries - their use by the British crown is not very different from the use, by the same crown, of Hessians in North America a couple of centuries ago. Nevertheless, the affection for them was, and remains, so strong that it enabled a popular actress to overwhelm the then government&rsquo;s tentative and hesitant immigration restrictions. A triumph of sentimentality over sense.</p>
<p>One of the great advantages which the Gurkhas used to have on their side (apart from their undoubted excellence as soldiers)was their cheapness - they could live very comfortably in Nepal on wages and pensions which were only a fraction of those paid to British troops. That advantage was sacrificed a few years ago in the name &#8220;race equality&#8221; and, as a result, we may soon see the law of unintended consequences in action.  I suspect that the government will find it convenient to disband the Gurkha regiments, blocking an anomolous route for uncontrolled immigration with an argument based on &#8220;necessary economies&#8221;. </p>

		<p>John Bull head the nail on the head. The Ghurkas were simply foreign mercenaries. Not that there is anything wrong with that or them. But the deal was to serve in the military in exchange for money. The money was enough to make them wealthy by Nepalese standards. But its not enough to live well in Britain. Lumley&rsquo;s campaign has only furthered Britain&rsquo;s role as a &#8220;soup kitchen&#8221; for 3rd worlders. And it has left the Ghurkas in Britain destitute.</p>

		<p>I worked in the Falkland Islands in 1985 helping to build Mount Pleasant Airport.On my Sunday off work,a friend and I took a climb to the top of Mount Pleasant.As we gazed down into the valleys on the other side of the Hills,we saw Ghurka soldiers patrolling the country.They saw us and smiled at us.<br/>
It was good to see the Ghurka friends of ours. </p>

		<p>Settling retired Gurkhas in the UK was frankly stupid and overly sentimental - Ms Lumley is a typical Western female idiot - but we must never forget that the average Gurkha in British service has done MUCH more than the vast majority of native Brits have ever done for Queen and Country. I&rsquo;d rather not have any non-whites in the UK, but if there ought to be any, retired Gurkhas and their families must be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t take many of them to fix the crime (ie Black crime) problem in the UK!</p>

You are right and you are wrong.<br/>
Nepals main source of export is it&rsquo;s Gurkha warriors, except for Nepal itself, both India and UK have Gurkha units.<br/>
The brits recruited them since they needed troops for their empire (along with african rifles and indian troops and various others) because they were considered a &#8220;martial people&#8221;.<br/>
Nepals main source of income is the pay that these soldiers send home.<br/>
The potential Gurkhas start their training from childhood, it being a goal of most nepalese boys to become one, and the UK ones are the ones most highly ranked, the gurkhas are highly disciplined and trained troops, who have shown excellence pretty much everywhere they have been deployed.</p>
<p>The problem is not with them.<br/>
The problem is that their extended families are coming to the UK, people that have never been in the employ of the UK armed forces.<br/>
Fact is, that by having them move to the UK, together with the ex-soldiers, they are essentially killing Nepals economy.<br/>
There is no reason for them to have to move to UK, give them their pensions in Nepal, like it was supposed to, how the unit was originally set up.<br/>
That is the best for everyone, yes everyone, including the gurkhas themselves, who can live nicely off of their pensions in Nepal, where everything is much cheaper.</p>
<p><br/>
And for the hessians? The hessians were actually conscripts that were taking part in the war as allies to the UK.<br/>
True, the reason they were allied were as simple as the fact that UK paid money to the hessian lords for their support.<br/>
The hessian soldiers were not there by free will, and in the end, 1/3 of them died, 1/3 went home and the remaining 1/3 actually stayed in USA and became american farmers, taking up an offer to be granted a piece of land if they deserted.</p>

		<p>One of Lumley&rsquo;s other keen interests is &#8220;indigenous rights&#8221; with the group &#8220;Survival International&#8221;.  Not to worry though, the quisling press and infantile celebrity worshipping culture in the UK ensure that the obvious questions about the indigenous rights of whites will never be asked, let alone pressed, and her nitwit blather can continue.</p>

The Gurkhas earned the right to call themselves Brits,which is more than can say for most white Britains.  The problem with democratic societies is that citizenship should be earned instead it&rsquo;s passed around like beer at a Nascar race. Citizenship should be something that is coveted and earned.   This is something that the Swiss understood, and why women didn&rsquo;t get to vote there until 1973, if you&rsquo;re not willing to lay down your life for your country you have no business deciding it&rsquo;s fate.  In medival Switzerland you had to be a soldier if you wanted to be a citizen,the citizens were literally expected to defend their country.</p>
<p>If every voter had to serve their country it would create a far more civic and patriotic society.       </p>

		<p>Numbers 3, 4, 8 and 10&hellip;all points well made. This is a tough one, because the Gurkhas are not third world, they have proven their courage and loyalty to GB time and time again. I&rsquo;ve never personally encountered any, but of those soldiers I know who have encountered them, are unanimous in their respect for them. I agree that they shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to immigrate into a society where they won&rsquo;t easily assimilate, and the fact remains that they aren&rsquo;t citizens. That being said, I hope the British government will do what&rsquo;s genuinely fair. The Ghurkas have earned the respect and gratitude of GB more than most, even if they are mercenaries.</p>
