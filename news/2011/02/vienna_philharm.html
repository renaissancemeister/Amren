			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joshua Kosman, San Francisco Chronicle, February 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, which arrives in Berkeley this week for a three-concert series that marks its first Bay Area visit in more than 20 years, is by common agreement one of the finest orchestras in the world. It&rsquo;s composed of some of the leading instrumentalists of Europe, their individual musical voices fused into a seamless communal sound that is steeped in a century and a half of tradition.</p>
<p>As it happens, all but four of those musicians are men, and all of them are white. {snip}</p>
<p>American music lovers ought to be having a real debate about just what it means for an artistic edifice so grand and arresting to be built on a foundation of more-or-less explicit sexual and racial discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What we can&rsquo;t do, though, is pretend that the VPO is an orchestra just like any other. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s the living embodiment of an exclusionary philosophy that should, at the very least, give any thoughtful person pause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>O<b>rganized protests</b></p>
<p>Then, in the face of some organized protests during an American tour, the orchestra, which is self-governing, relented  &mdash;  a little. One woman, a harpist who had been an adjunct of the orchestra for decades, was admitted to the ranks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The ban on racial minorities  &mdash;  which, in the context of the European musical scene, basically means Asians  &mdash;  has been unstated but even more determined. An attempt to parse the names on the orchestra&rsquo;s current roster suggests the possibility of one part-Japanese violinist, but otherwise the sea of white faces that will fill the stage of Zellerbach Hall promises to be unbroken.</p>
<p>That very homogeneity, according to one view, is what lends the VPO its distinctive character  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug. In a 1996 radio interview, for example, transcribed and translated by the musicologist William Osborne, one member described the orchestra&rsquo;s demographic makeup as an essential component of its style.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we make music here is not only a technical ability, but also something that has a lot to do with the soul,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The soul does not let itself be separated from the cultural roots that we have here in central Europe. And it also doesn&rsquo;t allow itself to be separated from gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>To his credit, the speaker went on to acknowledge the obvious fact that the orchestra&rsquo;s policies are both sexist and racist  &mdash;  but added that he believed these ills to be worth accepting. {snip}</p>
<p>In all honesty, it&rsquo;s not obvious how to respond on a practical basis to this imbroglio. On one level, I&rsquo;m grateful to Cal Performances for bringing the orchestra here, and I can&rsquo;t deny that I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing the concerts.</p>
<p>But at the very least, I&rsquo;d expect that the proponents of the VPO&rsquo;s policies should be compelled to defend them  &mdash;  frequently, vigorously and consistently. Surely the default position in America should be an opposition to blatant discrimination, and the burden of proof should be on those who favor it.</p>
<p><b>Easy complacency</b></p>
<p>Yet that hasn&rsquo;t happened. If the VPO&rsquo;s exclusionary policies are a scandal, so too is the easy complacency with which they have been accepted by audiences and promoters in this country throughout the decades that the orchestra has toured here.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But all too often, the matter has been greeted with a collective shrug, and the opposition met in turn with hostility. The prevailing attitude seems to be that issues of politics and morality  &mdash;  the sort of issues that most people can perceive clearly in connection with, say, corporate glass ceilings or the patronage of lunch counters  &mdash;  are suddenly off limits where music is concerned.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Surely the default position in America should be an opposition to blatant discrimination, and the burden of proof should be on those who favor it.&#8221;<br>
Actually, the burden of proof SHOULD be on the people who want to force an organization to accept members against their traditional norms. And people discriminate (by race, as well as other factors) all the time. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians all have their own organizations and cultural icons. And while we&rsquo;re on the topic of discrimination, isn&rsquo;t it about time that affirmative action (government-sanctioned anti-white discrimination) was abolished? Oh, wait, discrimination is only bad when practiced against non-whites.<br>
I think it&rsquo;s hilarious to watch the multiculti crowd. If something is the best, whether it is a school, an orchestra, or any other organization, then to the multiculti types it is a sign that they must be forced to integrate. Of course, when it then ceases to be the best, they scratch their heads and wonder why &#8220;diversity&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t made it even better.</p>

		<p>Most orchestras now have &#8220;blind&#8221; auditions. To keep the auditions fair, those judging the auditioning performers do not see them. I doubt whether the Vienna Philharmonic is allowing Asians to audition at all, for surely many have the technical skill to acquire orchestral positions by merit. Whether they possess the nebulous quality of &#8220;soulful&#8221; interpretation can be decided at a blind audition. A position should always we determined by merit. If the Philharmonic limited auditions to Austrian citizens their policy might be acceptable. They do not, however. A young White Minnesotan was accepted recently. <br>

		<p>Next they will say that all classical music is inherently racist because if you ever look around at a classical music concert you will mostly see whites. </p>
<p>Remember whites- you can&rsquo;t be racist or have your own land but it is okay for non-whites to be racist and have their own land (and yours!)</p>

<p>One has to wonder why Mr. Joshua Kosman believes this is an issue and why Mr. Kosman is obsessively counting and reducing people to their gender and social constructs.</p>
<p>Does Mr. Kosman have an agenda?</p>

		<p>The VPO is going to have to make their pit look more like a United Nations meeting if they want to continue to have a place in this pinko world. Do those racist Italians actually believe that excellence trumps diversity? Think again, White boys.   </p>
<p>And while they&rsquo;re at it, they need to hire a Black guy to scratch up records on a pair of turntables. Maybe then even Janeane Garafalo and Barack Obama will approve of those dinosaurs.</p>

		<p>The Chinese have eerily embraced Western classical art forms like our music and ballet, only because they are out to prove themselves in competition for global cultural status. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the kid who tries to dress and style his hair like his more popular classmate. It&rsquo;s no more than the high-brow equivalent of a group of Asians in a dive bar crooning karaoke to Western pop standards. </p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t see them mixing the races in their national ballet. Cultural expression is a form of warfare for them.  It would be a victory for them to infiltrate the highest expressions of Western culture with Asian faces. Then they can point and say, &#8220;Look. We&rsquo;re everywhere. Just as good as the whites&#8221;.</p>

<p>We should interfere with an indigenous white nations traditional choir, because it is white and male, but not question all black American gospel choirs, all black Jazz bands, all black, etc., etc., etc., the blind hypocrisy of this writer is more than amazing; it is outright anti-white and anti-male.</p>

		<p>I just happen to hear an interview with an &#8220;African American&#8221; jazz musician on NPR last Monday.  During his interview, he commented on the &#8220;stultifying&#8221; nature of European Classical Music as if it were inferior to jazz, which he claimed to be largely African in its roots.  I must wonder what this author might have to say about that?</p>
<p>By the way, Jazz used European instruments, and is more influenced by Jewish Ashkenazi Klezmer music, which was always heavy on clarinet and violin use.  During the early 20th century Jewish immigrants often lived in areas that were next to Black neighborhoods, or were actually displaced by blacks as they moved on.  Blacks picked up on Klezmer and added some African rythum as repetitions, which made up some later jazz modes favored by blacks.  Just being musically literate, just a little, and aware of our social history proves this. But blacks have been perpetuating this myth of origin and ownership for so long that no one questions it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how subliminal suggestion works; repeat any lie long enough, and accompany it with an image, and after a while no one will question it.  Our entire history and culture is being robbed from us this way. </p>

<p>I really wonder who thought of going to Berkeley, of all places?</p>
<p>This forcing of non-European, non-Austrians in a traditional Austrian male choir is nothing less than cultural assassination. No wonder Europeans continue to look down on Americans; we continue to find ways to meddle with them.  I wish they would just ban the U.S., so Americans could go on enjoying their high brow hip-hop, American Idol culture.</p>

		<p>See, in essence the Philharmonics are a private club of gentlemen music lovers (as their name implies). Their constitution expressly excludes females (until quite recently, 1997. Which I regard as rape of a sacred institution.) They have always borrowed performers from the Staatsopernorchester when they were short (usually involving the harp which seems to be a female instrument), but the dames were not formally members.<br>
They do not exclude rappers (it is well to note that Franz Liszt, unlike Beethoven, actually was a quadroon - though I have yet to hear some Afrocentrist scholar mention his name.)<br>
Still, the only nonwhites that might just make some inroads are the Japanese.<br>
- In the traditional New Year´s Concert, their conductors have been overwhelmingly Jewish (Karajan, Mehta etc.), one Japanese (Seiji Ozawa), and the last (Franz Welser-Möst) from where I was born.<br>
It is their exclusivity (and, as even the critic admits, their cohesion) that has made the Philharmonics the greatest orchestra in the world. Their screening process is brutal - by commission and behind a curtain i.e. sex and colour blind.</p>
<p>So: If comrade Kosman wants to listen to LaQeishas playin´da ole banjo, he is free to do so. But leave the Philharmonics alone.</p>

		<p>No one has ever complained that the Harlem Globetrotters are and have always been all black.  No doubt the more articulate members of the team would justify it by saying something like, &#8220;The soul does not let itself be separated from the cultural roots that we have here in upper Manhattan.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is white, and <i>only</i> white institutions that are always required to diversify, ideally to the point of 100% diversity, achieved when there are no whites in the institution at all.</p>
<p>I certainly hope all Amren readers in the Berkeley/San Francisco area will attend one of the VPO performances.<br>

		<p>I wish someone would ask those liberals if they wanted to go to an asian fusion restaurant and see all the cooks were white, black or whatever, just not asian.  They would not like it because they want the asian &#8216;experience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Same thing, what if they went to a concert of tibetan monks chanting, and half the monks were white guys, black guys and mexicans.  They would feel it wasn&rsquo;t authentic.</p>
<p>Should I go see an african tribal dance show, and half the dancers were arabs, chinese or swedes?</p>

		<p>Are all Chinese musical groups, or Japanese, critized for being mono-ethnic and mono-racial?  Never!  Are goofy tribal &#8220;musical&#8221; groups criticized for being all black?  And wouldn&rsquo;t any of those groups be looked down upon for having a white person, let alone a white male, among their ranks?  And, in fact, wouldn&rsquo;t it look silly to have a white face in a sea of Chinese or Afro faces?  There should be no apologizes for an Austrian group being, heaven forbid, all Austrian!  If they choose to let in a Czech or Hungarian, as former members of the Hapsburg Empire, so be it, but even that shouldn&rsquo;t matter nor be required.</p>
<p>How about a girl scout in the Gay Men&rsquo;s Chorus?</p>
<p>I watched a TV special on the Japanese Imperial family.  The Emperor&rsquo;s orchestra is required to be proficient in both classical Japanese music and what they called &#8220;western&#8221; classical music.  The entire orchestra looked Japanese to me.  Did not even occur to me that this wonderful, disciplined musical group would have to have a non-Japanese in order to play classical music of any sort.  Should the Emperor throw in a white musician when greeting the King of Spain or a Korean musician when entertaining the President of SK? NO!  When will this nonsense end.  And who, other than white people, and perhaps a few white &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are going to patronize this group any how?<br>

		<p>Human beings have a natural and unmitigated right to freely associate.</p>
<p>If there can be all black dance troups, all homosexual chorus&rsquo;, and all Mexican mariachi bands, why can&rsquo;t a Viennese orchestra be composed (no pun intended) of Viennese?  Would the author of this article, Mr. Kosman, also object if China proudly sent an orchestra of their best to tour the world?  Is he equally miffed at the South African all male, all black, singing group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, exhorting them to add some chinese lesbians to their enterprise?  </p>
<p>This is article is nothing but another marxist anti White screed, unfortunately written by a White man.</p>

		<p>I had the good fortune of attending a VPO performance in Vienna almost 30 yrs ago. It was a sublime experience. There was a unity between orchestra &amp; audience, a shared feeling going back &amp; forth, that I have never felt with any other symphony. I suppose you could call it the  &#8220;race soul&#8221; of the West in action. Kosman understands this. He hates it. He knows, for his world view to prevail, it must be destroyed. Every last expression, every last bastion, of the true spirit of Western Man must be exterminated. Perhaps we will be sending in the Marines one of these days, to make sure the correct gender &amp; race quotas are imposed &amp; and American morality reigns supreme in Vienna.</p>

		<p>The writer seems to have long since forgotten about that cherished American principle of freedom of association, the right to associate with those we prefer. In this case, the orchestra members have made particular exclusionary choices in order to maintain their traditions and their musical heritage, with fantastic results that are widely appreciated. Why should this require any active defense? The positive results are self evident for all who are not blind.</p>

		<p>If Austrian men and women, who support the orchestra as taxpayers, don&rsquo;t have a problem with it, then that is their business.  It isn&rsquo;t up to San Franciscans to demand that the VPO answer for its policies.  It does appear that the VPO is slowly accepting women into its ranks.  Since the VPO is self-governing, and members have often been pupils or sons of former members, it will probably take time for more women to be hired.</p>
<p>I see no problem with the orchestra continuing its tradition of using mostly native Austrian and Vienna-trained musicians.  They do play European music, after all.  The woodwind and brass musicians use special Viennese instruments, including the Viennese horn, which are rarely used outside of Vienna.  Perhaps they&rsquo;re afraid that relaxing one traditional rule means that all of them must be relaxed.  I don&rsquo;t think this need be the case.</p>
<p>The quoted musician&rsquo;s insistence on the gender issue does seems odd to me as an American. Central Europe has produced many great female classical musicians, including Annie Fischer and Anne-Sophie Mutter, both of whom have recorded with the VPO.  I don&rsquo;t support affirmative action, of course.  I simply think the orchestra could maintain its high quality with a preference for native Austrians and the willingness to hire the best musician.</p>
<p>As I said before though, the matter is for Austrians to decide.</p>

		<p>I earn my BA performing classical music at one of the top music academies in the United States in the 1980s.</p>
<p>many of my fellow students were Asian (meaning Oriental, of course), and many were extremely talented and dedicated.</p>
<p>even 30 years ago, it would have been simply idiotic to have excluded such Asians as Seiji Ozawa, the Tokyo Quartet, Yo Yo Ma, to name just a few geniuses, from musical life.</p>
<p>the best American orchestras are on par with the best European ones, and have had asians and women among in the ranks for decades.</p>
<p>I now live in Berlin, for the Philharmonic has a number of Asians and women, and is one of the most amazing orchestras in the world - unquestionably on par with the Vienna Philharmonic!!</p>
<p>(I have strong reservations about their English principal conductor, and can think of a number of conductors, including a couple of asians, I would rather see in his job).</p>
<p>to sum up:<br>
Asia has a rich musical tradition of its own, and it is no surprise that Asians gravitate toward European music and are proficient performers. </p>
<p>unfortunately, classical European music is losing its foothold among young Europeans and white Americans, who lack the concentration, discipline, and seriousness to appreciate it.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy of world historical proportions.</p>
<p>If the Vienna Philharmonic think that excluding asians from its ranks is helping, they&rsquo;re living a dream world.</p>

		<p>Any serious musician will tell you that music is an expression of WHO YOU ARE. The Vienna Philharmonic has a sound that only white European males can produce. It&rsquo;s precise, assertive (even aggressive), proud and urgent. I don&rsquo;t play classical stringed instruments, but I suspect that even the superior upper-body strength of males enables a range of dynamics that is beyond the capability of Oriental females. I know from personal experience that much of the passion that Orientals bring to the craft is based on relentless parental pressure, who wish for their children a place of status within their own culture. More power to them, but leave the Philharmonic alone. </p>

<p>You never see them complaining about African or Asian traditional art forms being dominated by Africans or Asians.

Same with any other aspect of the west. </p>

<i>&ldquo;The way we make music here is not only a technical ability, but also something that has a lot to do with the soul,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The soul does not let itself be separated from the cultural roots that we have here in central Europe.</i></p>
<p><br>
Some 20 years ago, when Warner Brothers wanted to make a Malcolm X bio-pic, the movie was originally slated to be directed by the white Canadian (and, FTR, non-Jewish) director Norman Jewison   &mdash;   probably due to Jewison&rsquo;s &#8220;affinity&#8221; for black subjects in his films <i>In the Heat of the Night</i> and <i>A Soldier&rsquo;s Story</i>. </p>
<p>But Spike Lee complained long and loud about Jewison, insisting that only a true black man like himself was capable of bringing Malcolm&rsquo;s story to the screen. One of Lee&rsquo;s arguments went, &#8220;Didn&rsquo;t the <i>Godfather</i> movies benefit from the fact that their director, Francis Coppola, was Italian? Would Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s mafia movies have had the same convincing realism to them if Scorsese hadn&rsquo;t been Italian?&#8221; </p>
<p>And so Warners relented, and (the Oscar-winning veteran) Jewison was removed, and the job was given to (the non-Oscar-winning, non-veteran) Spike Lee. </p>
<p>So I would very much like Spike Lee   &mdash;   plus ALL those other nonwhites like him who think of the Arts in racially-exclusive terms   &mdash;   to read the above statement from the VPO, and then tell Kosman and the SF Chronicle that they are WRONG. </p>
<p>If reserving the telling of the Malcolm X story for a black man will &#8220;improve&#8221; and &#8220;enrich&#8221; the final product, then an orchestra playing European music must also benefit from having only European players, no? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, of course, holding my breath waiting for such an honest, principled statement from Spike Lee&hellip; or anybody else, for that matter. </p>

If the Vienna Philharmonic think that excluding asians from its ranks is helping, they&rsquo;re living a dream world.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the reasons why young Europeans are deserting the Classical scene.  The constant flood of American pop culture is probably one reason, increased use of drugs is likely another.  But when I watch an Andre Rieu concert and see all those white faces in the crowd, it informs me that the interest of Europeans is definitely not dead.  But excluding Asians isn&rsquo;t the issue.  Allowing them to displace Europeans is the issue.  Asians and non-whites doing traditional European performing arts, from Shakespeare to Opera has been popular in the past because of its uniqueness AND the compliment it paid the European cultures, especially the composer, orchestra.  China wealth is allowing Chinese to acquire much in material wealth and culturally as well, and among a billion and a half people there is naturally going to be a larger talent pool.  But I have always noted that wherever Chinese go, they devastate, like a plague of locusts.  They also have long been a culture that copies other previous creations without much in the way of due respect.  (Copyright infringement has been a huge issue with China as it moved into its fairly unlawful form of capitalism).  </p>
<p>It is a sort cultural victory when Asians or anyone not European decides to learn and replicate its arts. HOWEVER, when that art allows its once totally European art forms, in this case classical music to be overrun at home by non-Europeans, something that can only be called &#8220;stealing culture&#8221; is what is in fact happening.  That is different from sharing culture.</p>
<p>When Europe was expansive, that is, going out into the world and spreading its influence, the populations of the world went through some turmoil, but also enjoyed a wonderful period of the expansion of civilization that lifted many peoples world wide into a better life because of the infrastructure, if nothing else.  For example, Mexico City would be a swamp with huts if Habsburg Monarch Maximillian hadn&rsquo;t reigned for the few short years in Mexico.  Hundreds of other examples exist.  If the core of the European art and cultural form is stolen through lack of discipline in Europe, IN Europe, robbing the art from the indigenous, the end result will not be a preservation of European culture or people.  They go hand in hand. So even though I wrote what I did about Andre Rieu, when he trots some non-European, non-white protege on the stage and everyone marvels and takes the big compliment (look, we are so great that everyone wants to be like us), they are influencing countless other non-Europeans to think, &#8220;If I can get into Europe, I will study music (or whatever the discipline might be), I will get a job and live in Europe, etc. Sounds okay, but the end result is the death of Europe culturally because a cultural art form is not just that.  It is a genetically caused phenomena.  People who spend ages developing, evolving in one part of the world, in the case Europe, imbibe into their genetic and character makeup, the fleshly result of the landscape and the conditions of history on the people.  Some of it are things that could be listed as historical events, like the Black Plague of the 14th century, that represents a bottleneck in genealogy, or something that historian Simon Schama touched upon in his book, &#8220;Landscape and Memory.&#8221; </p>
<p>One explanation for this is what has been called &#8220;transgenetics.&#8221;  Briefly put, transgenetics is a new theory of genetic possibility.  The premise is build on something that one may sense in any national/ethnic and racial group.  There are certain characteristics that have genetic cause that serve to provide the &#8220;soul&#8221; of a culture and race in the individual and it is something that cannot be taught in a school or trained into the outsider.  But to survive it must be protected.  It can be destroyed through genetic dissolution, out-breeding, etc.  So as majority Chinese Philharmonics in Europe develop to entertain the indulgent European population, the Chinese will eventually introduce feeling and modes that will eventually shift the sound, feel, and even structure to be more Oriental.  The result will be no different from the extinction of species caused by over harvesting and the overuse that the over-breeding Chinese always seem to bring along with their more admirable characteristics.</p>
<p>Music Centers for teaching classic forms used to be called &#8220;Conservatories.&#8221;  But they were conserving more than the music form.  They were preserving European culture and thereby, the European race.<br>

The radio talk host born Michael Alan Weiner has said over the air several times about how SF&rsquo;s symphony orchestra is a shell of its former self, mainly because of affirmative action.  Before AA, you auditioned for the SFSO behind a curtain, so that those impressed with the power to judge and make hiring recommendations couldn&rsquo;t see the person playing the instrument, only hear their music.  Which is the good color blind race neutral thing to do, right?  </p>
<p>Wrong.  All the new hires were still almost entirely white and overwhelmingly men.  So they started pandering and hiring less qualified non-whites, and as Dr. Weiner says, the SFSO &#8220;barely sounds better than a high school band.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sadly, VERY SADLY, even the RIVERDANCE troupe which I very much enjoyed UNTIL they admitted some thug black dancers who have a slightly different, ghetto style which they insert in the RIVERDANCE which makes it NOT RIVERDANCE any longer. Things are indeed going to hell in a 500hp 6 speed sports car.<br>

<p>Oh no!  Not Riverdance also?? I think I saw a black man on Celtic Woman also and it made me ill. I am not surprised since I have seen many youtube videos on Ireland and all of Euro nations being invaded by Africans and Muslims! Also many of those Irish White girls are dating these black thugs!  Just like in America. </p>
