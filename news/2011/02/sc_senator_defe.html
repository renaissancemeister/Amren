<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Ford [State Senator Robert Ford of Charleston] said the state needs Mexican workers who are willing to do jobs that blacks and whites are not willing to do.</p>
<p>An audio recording of the committee reveals that Sen. Ford said, &#8220;I know brothers, and when I&rsquo;m talking about brothers I&rsquo;m talking about based on race. Talking about black guys and they&rsquo;re not going to do that work at Boeing with all that dirt and stuff to be hauled to build that plant. Ain&rsquo;t no brothers gonna do that. Not like a Mexican will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A brother gonna find ways to take a break. They&rsquo;re gonna find some breaks,&#8221; he added. He continued to talk about some Mexicans who did yard work at his house and did it quickly and cheaper than anyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know my blue-eyed brothers, pale-skinned brothers ain&rsquo;t gonna do no work. They ain&rsquo;t gonna do that kind of work. And rightfully so. We have already paid our dues. Ever since this country was built, somebody came in and did the work for us. That&rsquo;s America. It&rsquo;s a country of immigrants,&#8221; he said during the meeting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sen. Ford told News Channel 7 Wednesday morning, &#8220;I said that, in most cases, about 99 percent of the time, the people who are doing the hard, hard, dirty work are Mexican immigrants. Because I said now as a black man, I&rsquo;m not going to be doing what they do. I&rsquo;m not going to be laying no foundation for no building, because I can&rsquo;t do that kind of work. I&rsquo;m not going to get on top of no roof in 100-degree temperature. I don&rsquo;t do that kind of work. But they do it and now we should accept the fact that they&rsquo;ve done more so than anybody else and make them citizens like everybody else that worked their way to American citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;d be willing to apologize to anyone who was offended, but says his comments were not a &#8220;racial thing.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Interesting.  A black state senator states that blacks aren&rsquo;t willing to do serious manual labor.  If I, a white man said that, I&rsquo;d be fired from my job.  Black men have about the highest unemployment rate of any racial/gender group in America.  If they couldn&rsquo;t mooch off their old lady&rsquo;s welfare check I suspect a lot more of them would be willing to build a foundation.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s a worthless fool if he apologizes with getting a negotiated agreement first.  We despise Whites who never negotiate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&rsquo;ll consider apologizing for hurting your black feelings, but you must show me what you will do to use my apology to stop you black criminals from robbing, raping, and murdering White girls, and you must sign this petition demanding that MLK&rsquo;s FBI file be opened to the public immediately.&#8221;</p>

All we need to do is start tying black failures to their demands of us, and then we will get sympathy from more of our own tribe.</p>

		<p>Ford does let some truth into his racial diatribe. He is right that bruthas, with the crutch or welfarism and affirmative action, are not going to do the hard dirty work that Mexicans do, but he is wrong in regards to the White man. Working class Whites will do the hard dirty work for decent wages. Unfortunatly the short-sighted greed of the Republicans and the desire of the Democrats to increase their voting bloc has undermined blue collar Whites. I&rsquo;m 45 and I remember a time when all road crews, roofers, painters, carpenters, plumbers, etc. were White men.</p>

		<p>Sen. Ford, if the Mexicans aren&rsquo;t there, the work still is. It has to get done. How do you think it got done before we were invaded?</p>
<p>The dollar is the drive behind politicians allowing the flood of Mexico&rsquo;s underclass into our country. It can get done cheaper, so who cares about the consequences?</p>
<p>This is not sustainable, senator.</p>

		<p>Speak for yourself, Ford.</p>
<p><i>He continued to talk about some Mexicans who did yard work at his house and did it quickly and cheaper than anyone else</i></p>
<p>He bragged about how multiple Mexicans only charged $10.  Rush read another version of this story today, and said that a local legitimate lawn care industry is just about out of business because of the cheap illegal labor.  What Mr. Ford declines to tell us is that the reason these Mexicans can work so cheaply is because they cram-jam into residences, and also many people in their residences get welfare.  Too, by definition, there was some crime committed   &mdash;   Either he knowingly hired illegal aliens or they committed identity theft/fraud.</p>
<p>To the extent that Mexicans et al &#8220;work hard,&#8221; it is to lay low until they&rsquo;ve figured out how to game the system, the welfare system and the immigration law system.  Once that happens, then their hard work stops.  Then the cheap labor lusters have to import even more &#8220;hard workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, all Ford is thinking about is his own political party.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what Gov. Nimrata Randhawa does with this bill if it gets to her desk.</p>

<p>Every time AR runs a news item about blacks&rsquo; insufficient opposition to   &mdash;   or even support for   &mdash;   massive mestizo immigration, bewildered commenters wonder why blacks don&rsquo;t resent that these new browns are taking all the traditional blue-collar jobs. Well, thanks to State Senator Robert Ford of Charleston, we now have the answer: blacks support illegal Mexicans because without them blacks might actually have to WORK. </p>
<p><br>
<i> I&rsquo;m not going to be laying no foundation for no building, because I can&rsquo;t do that kind of work. I&rsquo;m not going to get on top of no roof in 100-degree temperature. I don&rsquo;t do that kind of work.</i></p>
<p><br>
Actually Senator, you got it wrong the first time, but you got it right the second time. It&rsquo;s not that you CAN&rsquo;T do that kind of work, it&rsquo;s that you DON&rsquo;T do that kind of work. Blacks DON&rsquo;T and WON&rsquo;T do that kind of work because   &mdash;   and ONLY because   &mdash;   they are not currently required to do so. Instead, they can live off welfare&hellip; or they can shuffle papers in some gummint office&hellip; or they can run for State Senator and get paid big bucks and benefits for spouting racist generalizations and using double-negatives more suited to the ghetto than the State Senate. </p>
<p>And as for that bit about &#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to get on top of no roof in 100-degree temperature,&#8221; well, I don&rsquo;t see why not. Your black skin can withstand such temperatures better than the brown skin of the Mexicans. Mexico may be hot, but it&rsquo;s not as hot as Africa. Parts of Africa reach WELL OVER 100 degrees. Back in the Senator&rsquo;s native continent, there are places where 100 degrees would feel like a cool breeze. </p>
<p>In fact, Senator Ford, I&rsquo;d have to say that if ANYBODY should be doing menial labor outdoors, it&rsquo;s YOU. </p>

		<p>The reason that many people will not do that kind of work is because of the wages for those jobs are being pushed down by Hispanic illegals who are willing to accept low wages. I see a lack of integrity among these Hispanic illegals as they know that they are stealing the jobs from Whites by accepting low wages. Just as it is an unfair trade practice for businesses to artificially cut their prices to gain an unfair share of the market it is also unfair for these Hispanic illegals to accept low wages, which is undercutting legitimate competition for such jobs among Whites. I think the time has come to arrest, detain, and deport these Hispanic illegals- and impose severe penelaties against businesses who deliberately refuse to hire Whites because of the sheer greed,selfishness, and lack of community that are being practiced by these treasonous businesses.        </p>

		<p>No white is willing to be paid 1/3rd his current wage and what a Mexican can be illegally paid -solely- because he is off the books and thus paying no taxes himself.</p>
<p>However whites, amerinds and yes, even blacks have done high iron and foundation work and are proud of it.  Many of our greatest monuments (the Empire State Building, the Twin Towers, The Sears Towers, the White House, Capital and Congress) are all the work of largely whites construction.  Certainly all of Rome, London, Paris and much of the rest of Europe is.  We can do good work and take pride in it.</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t mind this man&rsquo;s racist comments as they indict him and his people&rsquo;s ignorance more than me and mine, the blatantly obvious question must be asked:</p>
<p>If these Mexicans are here as part of a working underclass whose only guarantee of cheap and dirty labor contribution to society are based on their status as illegals, what will happen when they are so no longer and specifically _when they have to be paid at rates commensurate with taxation_?  Why won&rsquo;t they also want to live the good life and not ruin their bodies by 40, doing hard labor?</p>
<p>This is the biggest problem I have with the assumption of racial integration as a move to legitimize all heretofore illegal elements of society: it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>From a Mexican standpoint, it means they are instantly on the hook to pay what whites and others do to sustain themselves and quite possibly off the dole in the process.</p>
<p>For industry and commercial sales, it means that the chance to pay people nothing and get them to indulge in junk consumerism (cheap goods, shoddily manufactured, far overseas) _also ends_.</p>
<p>So where is the motive to amnesty or otherwise legitimize illegal aliens, from either side?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all _got to be_ a sham operation.  Designed to replace us as an intelligent race who must be paid accordingly while profiting from menial labor in the short term, only.</p>
<p>And that creates a problem.  Because if all these corporate commerce types want is a competitive edge in the labor supply market, why don&rsquo;t they shift to robotics entirely and pull the grunge labor supply issue from the market overall?  Crime rates will plummet, transfer payments will plummet, tax levels will ease, and their _primary white purchasing body_ will become more interested in spending spare capital.</p>
<p>Money which will actually be worth something.</p>
<p>Indeed, reducing our labor overhead is just about the only way we have left to rebalance status of trade payments by _removing junk consumerism_ and gutting entitlement payments which leave this nation to a tune of 20 billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>There has got to be something else, some other motive, which is not being acknowledged in &#8216;the race&rsquo; to destroy America.</p>

		<p>SC state senator Robert Ford would do well to heed economist Thomas Sowell as to what sort of work blacks and whites will do: </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.Leaving prices out of the picture is probably the source of more fallacies in economics than any other single misconception. At current wages for low-level jobs and current levels of welfare, there are indeed many jobs that Americans will not take. The fact that immigrants  &mdash;  and especially illegal immigrants  &mdash;  will take those jobs is the very reason the wage levels will not rise enough to attract Americans &hellip; . It is elementary supply and demand. Yet we continue to hear about the &#8216;need&rsquo; for immigrants to do jobs that Americans will not do  &mdash;  even though these are all jobs that Americans have done for generations before mass illegal immigration became a way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or, in the words of Michael Scott of Glendora, California, in the Los Angeles Times:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;President Bush&rsquo;s &#8216;willing workers&rsquo; concept is little more than a national job fair for businesses and private residents that don&rsquo;t want to pay living wages. </p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;willing worker&rsquo; is generally a desperately poor, unskilled individual from the Third World seeking almost any kind of work. A &#8216;willing employer&rsquo; is generally a mercenary and conniving firm or individual offering employment to willing workers at non-living wages and with terrible working conditions. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is a marriage made in hell, on the backs of innocent U.S. workers, taxpayers, who are forced to pay $8.7 billion annually in unfunded mandates to support 2.9 million illegal aliens, just here in California &hellip;&#8221; (Los Angeles Times, May 22, 2005) <br>

		<p><i>Sen. Ford said the state needs Mexican workers who are willing to do jobs that blacks and whites are not willing to do.</i></p>
<p>The problem is two-fold. First, the construction companies WANT to keep wages artificially suppressed by flooding the market with cheap foreign workers. And they&rsquo;d actually prefer they be illegal since they can keep illegals under their thumb. And, second, people don&rsquo;t want and don&rsquo;t need to work hard as long as they can get welfare. Cut welfare and pay a decent wage and they could find PLENTY of people willing to do it.</p>

		<p>Problem being the Senator&rsquo;s comments are spot-on. The notorious laziness and innate dishonesty of Black workers explaining WHY hiring managers would ten-times more readily hire Mexicans than Blacks. Reminding me of a poster of a few years ago on AmRen, don&rsquo;t recall the name, but do recall him bragging about hiring illegals for the reasons I&rsquo;ve just pointed out.</p>

		<p>You can hire yourself a whole crew of white guys to make sure the works gets done right but if you do the government will force you to hire a few blacks to make sure that production suffers. </p>
<p>Or you can get yourself a whole crew of Latin workers and don&rsquo;t need to meet the black worker quota. </p>
<p>No one wants to hire blacks not even other blacks. </p>
<p>The only answer to the problem is to force every company that hires Mexicans and other Hispanic employees to hire more blacks. That will slow them down to a point where it&rsquo;s no longer profitable to hire them. That&rsquo;s how they did it to the white guys. </p>

There won&rsquo;t be any Mexicans walking around on my home, casing my place out.  I&rsquo;d love to see a study done on how many people are burglarized after having any sort of Mexican work crew at their home.  I know of several cases, including my own.</p>

		<p>  I don&rsquo;t think it is much of an improvement to replace all black workers with illegal Mexicans. The fact that they are willing to work for sub-par wages, as well as extended hours without overtime compensation, just shifts the financial burden from greedy employers to community/taxpayer funded social services.  California has been bankrupted providing services for all the illegal newcomers. </p>

		<p>Sen. Ford is right on point when it comes to black work ethic; a bit of an oxymoron, if you&rsquo;ve ever happened to work around large amounts of them. I have the unfortunate opportunity of living in South Carolina and can say, without any doubt, blacks are by far the laziest, most imcompetent and entitled group I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. </p>
<p>However, I definitely disagree with his view of the Mexican work ethic; again, an oxymoron in and of itself. OK, the illegals come here and work under the table for $5/hr; who cares? Doing so completely undermines American wages and is only encouraged by greedy, capitalistic (not saying capitalism is bad, mind you) whose only concern is the bottomline. </p>
<p>Besides, the &#8220;Mexican work ethic&#8221; is far over-exaggerated; in fact, my boss, who is Mexican, freely admits that his labor of choice are white Americans. It&rsquo;s a little thing called &#8220;quality over quantity&#8221;. If you want the work done cheaply and insist on a bunch of illegals smoking pot and drinking unthinkable amounts of booze on the job, by all means, hire them. Want it right? Get it done white. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve known this about blacks for years. All anyone has to do is go to a 7/11 in the early morning and see the work crews and independent contractors coming in for their morning coffee. You&rsquo;ll seldom see blacks.</p>
<p>But sadly, you&rsquo;ll also seldom see young White guys. We have two types of White young men it seems. Those who&rsquo;re overweight and a hard days work out in the sun might kill, and those who are so extremely thin that a hard days work out in the sun might kill (not all of them of course).</p>
<p>Look at our military armed forces. They turn down 75% of men who try to enlist for one reason or another.</p>
