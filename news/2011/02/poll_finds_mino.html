<h1>Poll Finds Minorities More Optimistic About Economy Despite Losses</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael A. Fletcher and Jon Cohen, Washington Post, Feb. 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite severe losses during the recession, the majority of African-Americans see the economy improving and are confident that their financial prospects will improve soon.</p>
<p>That optimism, shared to a lesser degree by Hispanics, stands in stark contrast to the deeper pessimism expressed by a majority of whites. In general, whites are more satisfied with their personal financial situations but also more sour about the nation&rsquo;s economic prospects.</p>
<p>Those are among the findings of a new Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation-Harvard University poll that probed attitudes in the wake of a downturn that more than doubled unemployment and wiped away nearly a fifth of Americans&rsquo; net worth.</p>
<p>African-Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be left broke, jobless and concerned that they lack the skills needed to shape their economic futures. But they also remained the most hopeful that the economy would soon right itself and allow them to prosper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, Hispanics also remain optimistic. Two-thirds said people can still get ahead if they are willing to work hard. Just over half predicted that their family&rsquo;s financial situation will improve over the next year.</p>
<p>Whites, also buffeted by the long recession, are the most resentful of government action and far less optimistic about what is ahead financially, both for their own families and for the country as whole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whites also are far less likely than blacks or Hispanics to think their children will be better off than they themselves are now. Whites also are most likely to say, &#8220;It will be a long time before the economy recovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>And among those who have shifted their lifestyles over the course of the economic downturn, whites are the most likely to see those changes as permanent.</p>
<p>Most whites say the economic situation is a cause of stress in their lives, and half say they are frustrated.</p>
<p>While the stated stress level among African-Americans is lower, some data show a heavier toll. The downturn obliterated years of African-American economic progress   &mdash;   strides that were on shaky ground even before the recession. The share of black adults who were working slid to 52 percent, nearly seven points behind whites and Hispanics. In 2001, nearly 65 percent of white adults and just over 60 percent of blacks were employed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, some of the most reliable paths for blacks to ascend to the middle class are in danger of being narrowed.</p>
<p>Federal, state and local governments, which employ a disproportionate share of African-Americans, are shedding jobs, a trend expected to continue in coming years. Meanwhile, the auto industry, long a bastion of high-paying, stable jobs that helped sustain many black middle-class families throughout the industrial Midwest, has been significantly downsized.</p>
<p>Still, a substantial majority of African-Americans are bullish about the future. More than half say they are better off than their parents were at the same age, and six in 10 are confident that their children will be even more prosperous.</p>

		<p>The media keep telling us that blacks are worse off in The Great Recession than whites, yet at the same time they&rsquo;re more hopeful about the future.  This means either one of two things:  Either blacks are so stupid that they&rsquo;re totally oblivious to their own economic circumstances, in the glow of the joy of having a half-black President, or two, it isn&rsquo;t as bad for blacks as they keep telling us, because they benefit from black skin privilege.  </p>
<p>I lean toward the second theory.</p>

		<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t they  be optimistic.  Our harshly anti-white racist government has been willing for generations to take the majority of wealth away from whites and give non-whites a 6 figure income.</p>
<p>They essentially have a docile slave race providing for them.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise blacks and mestizos are more optomistic about the state of the economy. As long as they still get their foodstamp EBT cards, WIC checks, substidized housing vouchers, free school breakfasts and lunches for the kiddies, AFDC checks and still have money left over for pricey cell phones, late- model SUVs, glitzy cars, designer clothes; our &#8216;economic downturn&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t really seem too terrible.  </p>

<p>As long as welfare, affirmative action, and free handouts continue at the expense of whites, the economy will always look good to minorities. When the free handouts and favoritism ends, so will the economy. </p>

		<p>One of the first things I noticed about this article was this passage.<br/>
&#8220;African-Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be left broke, jobless and concerned that they lack the skills needed to shape their economic futures. But they also remained the most hopeful that the economy would soon right itself and allow them to prosper.&#8221;<br/>
Maybe I&rsquo;m reading too much into this, but why does it always seem like blacks are hoping for a miracle when it comes to their woes?</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit&hellip;<br/>
&#8220;Whites also are far less likely than blacks or Hispanics to think their children will be better off than they themselves are now. Whites also are most likely to say, &ldquo;It will be a long time before the economy recovers.&rdquo;&#8221;<br/>
Gee, you think? Why would whites be optimistic about their children&rsquo;s future in a country that treats them like dirt?</p>

An economist who can explain why whites are right to be pessimistic and what they can do to protect their wealth is Peter Schiff.  A ten-minute collection of video clips of Schiff making fools of various bullish economics talking heads in the 2006-2007 period has garnered 1.8 million hits on youtube:<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/67otdk" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/67otdk</a></p>
<p>Schiff provides a ten-minute video blog approximately weekly that I find highly instructive as to the meaning of economic developments. Schiff&rsquo;s a good teacher. The video blog is well worth the free subscription.  I listen to each blog twice.  Sign up at his web site, Europac.net.</p>
<p>Schiff sees precious metals (gold, silver, gold and silver mining stocks), commodities and Asian stocks as the best way to preserve wealth in coming inflationary times.  For the dedicated, Schiff has begun offering a subscription ($50/year) to Schiffradio.com, which features daily short interviews with such figures as Ron Paul, John Stossel, Thomas Sowell, Steve Moore (Wall Street Journal)&hellip; That&rsquo;s in February alone (available in Schiffradio.com&rsquo;s archives).</p>

When was the last time blacks and Hispanics were denied any public money? They can&rsquo;t conceive of the idea that the money will ever stop flowing their way. As long as one white man has money, they expect to get theirs.</p>
<p>The first American revolution involved unreasonable taxes by a King. The second American revolution may involve unreasonable taxes payed to blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>If it comes down to a real fight, whites will have to take a stand. Unlike the British, blacks and Hispanics aren&rsquo;t going to acquiesce.  If &#8216;their&rsquo; money is cut off, it will make the riots of the &#8216;60&rsquo;s look like a picnic in the park.<br/>

		<p>&#8220;African-American&#8221; is such a bogus, ridiculous 7-syllable term that it&rsquo;s hard to believe educated members of the media can bring themselves to use it all, let alone as often as they do. &#8220;African-American&#8221; wrongly presupposes that &#8220;African&#8221; is synonymous with black, that non-black North Africa isn&rsquo;t part of Africa, and that white South Africans whose ancestors settled parts of South Africa before blacks arrived aren&rsquo;t African.  &#8220;African-American&#8221; also has the disadvantage of being useless in describing the race of a black person whose nationality is either unknown or not American.  </p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;d be willing to put up with &#8220;African-American&#8221; if whites were just as ritualistically referred to as &#8220;European-American.&#8221;  But then, the whole point of politically correct language is to be inconsistent and to have double standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is also a bogus racial category, as millions of people with Spanish-speaking backgrounds are white.  Most &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are brown, as in  Amerindian.  But they apparently aren&rsquo;t to ever be referred to by race in the media, only by their current or past familial linkage to Spanish.</p>

		<p>Off topic but this does involve economic policy- This weekend here in Phoenix the Tea Party Patriots are holding their American Policy Summit. If I attend, what is the best way to bring up the defining issue of Race. Of course, it is not on the agenda but what can I do to raise awareness of it during the sessions? Any bits of advice would be helpful. I have some ideas of my own; I know I shouldn&rsquo;t be militant or maybe not even too passionate. I am political on a personal level but not in any organized settings. Any thoughts? I made my e-mail available if you wish to use it.</p>

		<p>Minorities are not optimistic, but Whites are facing White genocide.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a White genocide evidence wiki. </p>
<p>One thread is here:  http://www.whitenewsnow.com/bob-whitakers-pro-white-bbq/15183-white-genocide-evidence-wiki-project.html</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s encourage user submissions to compile ALL quotations providing evidence for the intent or the act of White genocide. This will need minimal cleanup/edits/review every few weeks. In no time flat, we&rsquo;ll have a HUGE list of all the anti-White quotations. (Ancillary goals: voting records, indoctrination plans, immigration plans, corporate sponsorships.) This will bring us three great things for White people:</p>
<p>1. Evidence for future White genocide prosecutions, tribunals, or exposures<br/>
2. Anti-Whites will be even more nervous and may slow up their assaults<br/>
3. Provides excellent eye-openers for more White awakenings</p>
<p>Classify each quotation by UN Genocide part a, b, c, d, or e. Provide the context and provide as many references as possible for the quotation. </p>
<p>This will be open IP rights. Everyone is encouraged to copy, download, and spread it around to have plenty of redundant, hard, and soft backup copies in case of attack or shutdown. </p>

&ldquo;The goal of abolishing the White race is on its face so desirable that some may find it hard to believe that it could incur any opposition other than from committed White supremacists…Keep bashing the dead White males, and the live ones, and the females, too, until the social construct known as the White race is destroyed. Not deconstructed, but destroyed.&rdquo; </p>
<p></p>
<p>excerpt:</p>
<p>International law defines genocide as an international crime against humanity, with grave punishment for violations. As far as the international recognition of the reality of race, ask the ghosts of Saddam Hussein or Wilhelm Frick if the Kurds or Jews, respectively, are mere social constructs. Race is an internationally-recognized reality and is a major factor in the crime of genocide. In the future, the political and economic elites that are responsible for the policies of White genocide may face trial before an international tribunal. The 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article II states: <br/>
In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group as such: <br/>
(a) Killing members of the group; <br/>
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; <br/>
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; <br/>
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; <br/>
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.<br/>
The present immigration and political policies of many traditionally White nations, especially the United States, are in violation of part (c) and possibly part (d). White nations have been subverted to conditions that heavily favor non-White immigration, restrict White birthrates, and encourage and support non-White birthrates, and are thus calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the White race. </p>

		<p>First, blacks would probably view any criticism of the economy as a criticism against their beloved savior Barack Obmama. </p>
<p>Second, blacks are heavily employed recession proof affirmative action jobs and could careless about the private sector. </p>
<p>Third, how many blacks actually read newspapers or peruse newspapers or news websites and would be aware that we near have a double digit unemployment rate?</p>

		<p> When you have the full backing of the Federal Government with affirmative action, qoutas, set asides,welfare, food stamps. black and hispanic caucuses. preferential college admissions and a list like this that goes on forever; plus the ruing elite that is determined to destroy the white race. It&rsquo;s easy to be optimistic about the future.<br/>
 None of the aforementioned programs will ever end.The blacks and hispanics know this. So; yeah, it is easy for them to be upbeat!!</p>

		<p>I am one of those whites who sees the writing on the wall.  Everywhere I go, I see employers in a rush to hire non-whites.  </p>
<p>In education, most teachers are still white because there are still some standards in place, though the social justice people have worked around this in the last 15 years by pushing for administrators to be non-white, and of course all the support staff from secretaries on down to the janitors are rapidly being replaced by non-whites.</p>
<p>The assault on the teachers unions, by both the left and the right, are the final nail in the coffin for the white teaching force though.  When they can fire and hire at will, white teachers will become a rarity.  </p>
<p>The &#8216;standards&rsquo; won&rsquo;t let this happen you say?  Have you heard about all the &#8216;alternative certification&rsquo; programs now?  You don&rsquo;t need to study education and a content area anymore.  The teacher certification tests are already called raciss&rsquo; and will be watered down.  Ten years from now education is going to be a joke in most of the country.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a joke in the urban areas now, but that&rsquo;s because of all the low IQ students.  At least most of the teachers are still good.  You can&rsquo;t make gold from dirt you know.</p>
<p>In other fields, whites just can&rsquo;t get jobs anymore.  I fear for my son&rsquo;s future.  Look, when we were young, it was easy to get an entry level job at 15 or 16.  Some restaurant, a store, some place to get some experience and move up.  Now everywhere I go, and I mean everywhere, all the positions are filled with latinos and an odd, angry black here and there.</p>
<p>What restaurant, store, car wash or other place is going to hire a 16 year old white kid, when they can hire 30 year old latinos who will work under the table and never complain?  Would I want my kid working around low class individuals, such as I see everywhere now?  Yes, my friends, our economic future is grim indeed.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity, you have been a great contributor.  With that said it is both, blacks are oblivious and their skin privilege is showing too.</p>
<p>With the economy in the dumps and being stagnant costs for many things(like houses) are getting cheaper, but their welfare income and other social(ist) services remain the same, or more.  This still has the same effect as a raise, but instead of you making more money everything else gets cheaper, mostly.</p>
<p>Lastly, we could hear the seven trumpets of the apocalypse and blacks would say that it is a good thing if a black man is in the White House.  They will seriously follow him to hell and back if need be.</p>

<p>I think each group, in its own way, gets it right.</p>
<p>Blacks SHOULD be more optimistic about the future, as they have for the past half-century had phenomenal levels of government largess shoveled their way. And under Obama, they know that generosity from which they benefit will only intensify. </p>
<p>And conversely, Whites SHOULD be more pessimistic, as we&rsquo;re the ones who have to PAY for all this minority uplift, through a very long list of government wealth-redistribution schemes. </p>
<p>So since the Great Society/Civil Rights/Age of Aquarius 1960s, black lives have been getting better at the DIRECT EXPENSE of White lives getting worse. And it&rsquo;s a situation that&rsquo;s unlikely to improve any time soon. </p>

My advice would be to not bring it up at all but spend your time listening carefully to whether THEY bring it up at all! In other words, forego the introduction of the issue for one meeting in order to get a perfect read on what the people you hope to sway next time are really thinking. Then use THAT infor the next time around. I`ve made the mistake of misreading my audience and it wasn`t pretty&hellip;</p>

&#8220;It&rsquo;s no surprise blacks and mestizos are more optomistic about the state of the economy. As long as they still get their foodstamp EBT cards, WIC checks, substidized housing vouchers, free school breakfasts and lunches for the kiddies, AFDC checks and still have money left over for pricey cell phones, late- model SUVs, glitzy cars, designer clothes; our &lsquo;economic downturn&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t really seem too terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ditto! The optimism will remain so long as the illegal invasion is allowed to continue, whereby millions of mestizos flood our country under the guise of &#8220;multiculturism and diversity.&#8221; Automatic citizenship for their anchor spawn means a lifetime of public benefits and a chance for sponsorship down the line. They get preferential consideration in hiring and college admissions if they don&rsquo;t end up in a gang or jail first.</p>
<p>Of course these parasites deny themselves nothing, including late model luxury vehicles with all that money left over from their tax free jobs. Food, housing, and medical care are all provided free at the expense of the struggling White middle class, or what&rsquo;s left of it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to be &#8220;optimistic&#8221; about? America is Mexico&rsquo;s welfare system and they have it pretty damn good!<br/>

<p>This is a fantastic idea. I once told someone who was looking for ideas for a pamphlet to get a collection of anti-white quotes together and top it off with something like &#8220;If racism is so bad then why do these people get away with it&#8221;. He wound up not doing it but it was only a matter of time when someone would follow through. Non-aware whites are really starting to be receptive to this kind of thing. </p>

<p>Blacks are &#8216;survivors&rsquo;?  Yeah, really have it hard living in a majority white country where they get all their freebies and can hate the majority population that is quiet and civil towards them while they commit and say the most nasty and mean stuff.  Whites today may seem pampered, but I bet you more and more whites will start waking up soon as I know more who have.  More whites aren&rsquo;t caving into the &#8216;racist&rsquo; accusation like we have been for awhile now.  That&rsquo;s at least a good sign.</p>

		<p>All of the above comments are spot on. And do you remember when you were young, stupid and carefree? You didn&rsquo;t know enough to have anything to worry about. As you got older, more aware, had more responsibilities and more to lose, THAT&rsquo;S when things began to matter. More details became important, you had more connection with what is happening around you having an impact on your life.</p>
<p>Well, to do that, one has to mature; to have intelligence, to learn, to grow. There&rsquo;s a reason for the cliche &#8216;ignorance is bliss&rsquo;. And boy, are they blissful.</p>

The Welfare Reform Act, which President Clinton signed in 1996, restricted access to welfare, and ended it as a life time entitlement. After it was signed there was a sharp decline in welfare rolls.</p>

Aid to Families with Dependent Children together with food stamps were two percent of the federal budget in 1992, before the Welfare Reform Act was signed.</p>

		<p>Whites in Europe and North America are in fact experiencing genocide.</p>
<p>This is not hyperbole, it is technically true.</p>
<p>When Stalin, for example, stuffed for countries like Latvia full of Russians and forced everyone to speak Russian, that was justifiably considered to be a form of cultural genocide.</p>
<p>The Muslim invasion in Europe, organized and sponsored by European governments, is a form of genocide.</p>
<p>Mass Third World immigration to the United States is also a form of genocide against the former majority white population.</p>
<p>The irony is that nonwhites all over the earth desperately want to live in white majority countries instead of the gruesome hell holes they have created for themselves - but once they have completed their invasion of white countries and degraded and destroyed them, there will be nowhere left to go, and they will be stuck living in countries as squalid and revolting as the ones they abandoned.</p>
<p>Once the United States looks like Mexico, where are all the Mexicans going to know in order to escape from&hellip;.other Mexicans??</p>
<p>The North Pole??</p>
<p>Whites are so crazy and in such massive, psychotic denial that it will take shock tactics to wake them up.</p>
<p>It is time for new strategies, because as the situation worsens, why people are just not coming to their senses fast enough.</p>
<p>We need a massive public information campaign financed by a group of very generous billionaires.</p>

		<p>Some think that the goodies will be cut when the econony tanks even more.  Keep dreaming, it will never happen.  In this recession, the goodies have been increased.  In NYC, more food stamp benefits were given because of the recession.  Here in Queens, it seems like every immigrant has a Medicaid/food stamp card.  And drive pretty nice cars too.  And our &#8220;model minority&#8221;?  On the dole too.  So many elderly immigrants getting all the goodies, including SSI and housing.  Don&rsquo;t liberals see that it&rsquo;s insane to import the world&rsquo;s poor?  Even so-called conservatives won&rsquo;t say it.  The only one who will is Pat Buchanan.  But he&rsquo;s been marginalized not only by the media and the left, but by other &#8220;conservatives&#8221;.  Remember when that phony Bill Buckley started the smear campaign?   </p>

<p>Nice try.  Clinton only signed welfare reform because he thought it would ensure his victory, (it partially did), his party re-taking the House and Senate (it did not), and therefore they could undo it.  And if that didn&rsquo;t happen, I&rsquo;m sure he thought there was always good ole SSI to pick up the slack.  And that did happen   &mdash;   Between the signing of W/R and 9/11, SSI was the fastest growing line item in the Federal budget.  Source is Human Events mag, can&rsquo;t find any corroboration online.</p>
<p>As an aside, the pretext for so many former AFDC clients making the lateral move to SSI was that their children were &#8220;retarded&#8221; or &#8220;LD.&#8221;  All the while, we&rsquo;re supposed to believe IQ is passe or unimportant, and &#8220;certainly&#8221; there are no racial (oops sorry, social construct) differences therein.</p>

Oh, they have it so tough. They can &#8220;only&#8221; get three dependents covered by welfare, and they have a lifetime cap of 5 years on their welfare benefits (unless they move to another state). And every other welfare program is unaffected. Not to mention they get their schools, housing, and other amenities subsidized by white taxpayers, get preferences at public (and most private universities), preferences in government hiring, and the ability to sue companies that use &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; (not so easy that someone with an IQ of 85 can pass it) tests in hiring.</p>

		<p>Engleman is correct:</p>
<p>Clinton signed the 1996 PROWORA act under intense pressure from Republicans who had control of both houses for the first time in 40 years.  One of Clinton&rsquo;s central platforms in his 1992 campaign was to reform the welfare program such as by adding work requirements and to &#8220;end welfare as we know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>By 1994, however, Clinton had done nothing except veto two welfare reform bills put before him by Gingrich.  Clinton met with Trent Lott but a compromise could not be reached.</p>
<p>Clinton, no dummy, knew it was political suicide to veto a third bill during a campaign season with welfare reform as a central theme and signed the bill on August  22, 1996, and as the political animal he is, claimed full credit as reported by the willing media (remember CNN = Clinton News Network).</p>
<p>In the decade after &#8220;welfare reform&#8221;, welfare rolls dropped substantially, from 12.2 million to 4.5 million.</p>

		<p>Someone said above that our elits are trying to destroy us, but I believe it is white women that are trying to replace (destroy) us (though not all of them). They view us as feminin (weak) because we typically have pink skin and a lot of times have light hair and eyes. They prefer darker men because dark is perception wise dominate. The feminin nature is largely driving all of this. This isn&rsquo;t the first time (in my view) that women have tried to get white men conquered and replaced, they were scheming and manipulating white men with witch craft and whatnot during the Ottoman Empire in which Muslims reached all the way to Vienna Austria. Western women have always had fantasies of Muslim war lords and his harems.</p>
<p>I give up on all this years ago when I came to this realization, and I could find no reason to try and save a people and culture when the women of that culture and people clearly do not desire the men generally (theres a few exceptions of course). I do not believe that the big majority of men understand what females find attractive, white men believe that because they find white women by far the most attractive because of their phenotypes and skin color that white women must surely be the same, but they actually are quite the opposite.</p>
<p>I believe that the future of prosperity is in East Asia. The western world is turning into a dysfunctional third world.</p>
