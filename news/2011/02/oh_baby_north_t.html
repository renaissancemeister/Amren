			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kirk Baird, Toledo Blade, February 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Every mother thinks her baby is the cutest in the world. </p>
<p>But Tahisha Williams-Townsend, a 32-year-old North Toledo resident can prove it.</p>
<p>Her 2-year-old daughter, Mercy Townsend, was recently chosen as grand-prize winner of the first Gerber Generation Photo Search. The online contest to find a new advertising face as part of the company&rsquo;s Gerber Generation marketing campaign was launched in June and ran through November. The competition was open to children up to 4 years old, and Mercy won among nearly 220,000 entries nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;The judges saw something in her they really liked,&#8221; Mrs. Williams-Townsend, a nursing assistant, said. &#8220;I see it every day and now the rest of the world gets to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercy, along with her mom and dad, Damion Townsend, also 32 and a musician, will be taking a trip to New York later this month for a photo shoot for the Toledo �toddler. Mercy will also receive a $25,000 college scholarship for placing first.</p>
<p>Cathy Abramski, a spokesman for Gerber, said the judges selected Mercy &#8220;because of her visual appeal and expressiveness.&#8221; Mercy will star in a Gerber Generation print advertising campaign that advocates a healthier future for children through good nutrition, she said. The Gerber advertisement starring Mercy will be featured in select national parenting magazines beginning in May. </p>

<p>Does anybody really believe this? The child is rather ordinary looking and the mother is slightly overweight.</p>
<p>Can you say &#8220;affirmative action?&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, note the name of the marketing campaign: &#8220;Gerber Generation,&#8221; meaning the next generation of Americans is non-white, I suppose.</p>
<p>Gerber will probably name its next campaign &#8220;America&rsquo;s Future,&#8221; and feature a Hispanic child.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s a dangerous move for Gerber. Seriously. They better hope little Mercy doesn&rsquo;t end up in prison by 14 or in some internet viral video beating on a customer at Chuck E Cheese&rsquo;s. Also, Gerber should keep its fingers crossed regarding mom Tahisha. </p>
<p>It is obviously a pandering move to blacks but I suspect Gerber thought this through and they have plans to rip-off the people they are highlighting one way or another.</p>
<p>In any event, they lost my business.</p>

		<p>Though it was quite a long while ago, this IS the same Gerber who advertised that their apple juice was 100% pure apple juice - and it was discovered that the &#8220;juice&#8221; was entirely chemicals and flavoring and not a drop of apple juice in it.  Quite a scandal.<br>
The point is, if they&rsquo;d betray millions of mothers and babies that way, it should come as no surprise that they&rsquo;d betray the white race which built their empire for them through buying their products and their propaganda.  I wonder if that certain tribe we all know owns Gerber?  That would explain a LOT.</p>

		<p>This is another example of how degrading affirmative action can be, for everyone. If this girl was white she wouldn&rsquo;t have a prayer of being the Gerber baby, and people know it. But this isn&rsquo;t &#8220;fair,&#8221; so she&rsquo;ll get some token status, and Gerber has doubtless already figured out how to roll out this campaign without too much of a drop in sales.</p>
<p>Shop right, buy white.</p>

		<p>I buy many baby products for my two infants, and I always avoid buying the products with pictures of black babies whenever possible.  I&rsquo;ve even paid more for a box of infant cereal with a white baby on it - I consider it a small investment in my own sanity.  After all the trouble blacks have caused me and my people, the last thing I need is their children staring at me from my own kitchen shelves!  </p>
<p>I wonder how many other parents find themselves reaching around the black baby boxes to grab the products featuring a white baby?  It&rsquo;s been proven many times that people do this with magazines, and I&rsquo;ll bet even more do it with children&rsquo;s items.  </p>

		<p>This is purely an advertising and corporate decision. Gerber is owned by Nestle - before that it was owned by another European company - Sandoz.</p>
<p>I cannot determine what their focus groups saw in such a decision.</p>
<p>I suspect the new Gerber &#8220;chiall&#8221; will slowly fade from view.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how any mother can feed her child that Gerber muck anyway..I have to leave the area when I see some slobbering sprog spitting that outlandish-looking slop all over itself and anything nearby. It&rsquo;s enough to gag a buzzard. A resourceful relative of mine, fed up with the cost of baby &#8220;food&#8221;, was able to replicate a week&rsquo;s worth of Gerber products in two hours time. And her baby got real, FRESH food. The cheapest food processor in your local discount store will get the job done-even with meats</p>
<p>  I will admit, the image of the child that graced the Gerber label for decades is charming. Not so, that &#8220;thing&#8221;, and all the others in the latest round of advertising from Gerber.</p>
<p>  It&rsquo;s all for the best, really..some of the most offensive advertising is for products that are unnecessary at best and downright harmful at the worst. Eschew them.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many white families had their time wasted and got their hopes up in applying for this when Gerber already had in mind using a &#8220;child of color&#8221; in their advertisements?</p>
<p>Similarly, how many whites are forced to waste their time, money (and potentially discard other opportunities) and get their hopes up apply for jobs where the committee who decides already knows that they want a black woman?</p>

I just went to the Gerber website.<br>
http://www.gerber.com/photo/#/winners/<br>
 <br>
From June to October there were six winners every month. During November five were listed. This may be because Mercy Townsend was a winner for November.<br>
 <br>
Anyway, of these 35 winning babies, one was black, one was Oriental, one may have been Hispanic. The others were white. All were cute. </p>

		<p>Who would feed their baby that chemical-ridden slop anyhow? There are much better varieties found at Whole Foods and Trader Joe&rsquo;s. They are organic and pure. Forget about Gerbrer&hellip;we don&rsquo;t need to fee our babies affirmative action and toxic chemicals&hellip;two things that will destroy them.</p>

		<p>A black baby the cutest?  Is that why adoption agencies across the country can&rsquo;t give away black babies? It&rsquo;s that same &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes&#8221; thinking we&rsquo;ve seen with the mainstream media&rsquo;s insistence that Michelle Obama is &#8220;gorgeous&#8221; and &#8220;glamorous&#8221;.

<p>I do the same thing.  There&rsquo;s no bigger turn off than seeing Uncle Ben&rsquo;s, Aunt Jemimah or some black in a cowboy hat on a product smiling at me on the shelves in the store.  It could be half the cost of other brands and I still won&rsquo;t touch it.  </p>

<p>I beg to differ, respectfully.  Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemimah remind me of days gone by, and I gladly purchase any product that reminds me of those days.  Now, the gerber &#8220;baby?&#8221;  Not in the same league.  &#8220;Darkie&#8221; toothpaste?  I&rsquo;m there.</p>

		<p>If they didn&rsquo;t have &#8220;minority babies&#8221; sooner or later, they would have been sued.  It&rsquo;s all about protection.  Just like the Miss America and Miss Universe pageants; It&rsquo;s all racial politics.  Every successful man goes for a Nordic blonde, but they can hardly win a beauty contest anymore. </p>

		<p>I am sure it does little good but I never buy from companies that have a black male all over a white female in their ads. and these are becoming a lot more common or from a company that seems to present the blacks as something special and smarter than their nit wit white neighbors.<br>
The white guy collects bottles on the street and the black family is comprised of two doctors a lawyer and three Nobel Peace Prize winners. (Although the way those prizes are handed out today that wouldn&rsquo;t be such an impossible task)</p>
