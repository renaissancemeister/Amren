<h1>Texas Demographer: &#8216;It&rsquo;s Basically Over for Anglos&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Houston Chronicle, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Looking at population projections for Texas, demographer Steve Murdock concludes: &#8220;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two of every three Texas children are now non-Anglo and the trend line will become even more pronounced in the future, said Murdock, former U.S. Census Bureau director and now director of the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Texas population can be divided into two groups, he said. One is an old and aging Anglo and the other is young and minority. Between 2000 and 2040, the state&rsquo;s public school enrollment will see a 15 percent decline in Anglo children while Hispanic children will make up a 213 percent increase, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 6 percent of the state&rsquo;s population is not documented, he said.</p>
<p>B y 2040, only 20 percent of the state&rsquo;s public school enrollment will be Anglo, he said. Last year, non-Hispanic white children made up 33.3 percent of the state&rsquo;s 4.8 million public school enrollment.</p>
<p>Of the state&rsquo;s 254 counties, 79 recorded declining population during the past 20 years. All are rural. An additional 30 Texas counties, he said, would have also lost population had they not experienced Hispanic growth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unless the trend line changes, 30 percent of the state&rsquo;s labor force will not have even a high school diploma by 2040, he said. And the average household income will be about $6,500 lower than it was in 2000. That figure is not inflation adjusted so it will be worse than what it sounds.</p>

I&rsquo;ve noticed that the word &#8216;white&rsquo; has been dropped from most public use. Here we&rsquo;re repeatedly referred to as &#8216;Anglos&rsquo;. </p>
<p>A Euphemism is &#8220;a substitution for an expression or word that may offend or suggest something unpleasant to the receiver&#8221;.</p>
<p>When we use euphemisms instead of &#8216;white&rsquo; so that listeners won&rsquo;t be offended, we are complicit in our own demise.</p>

And the average household income will be about $6,500 lower than it was in 2000.&#8221;  While politicians dream of all the new votes gotten, they fail to consider where the tax revenues will come to support the new under-class. Detroit, Camden, Los Angeles are the examples.  Soon it will be state level issue.</p>

		<p> Look for Mr. Murdock to catch some flack for the &#8220;It&rsquo;s a terrible situation you&rsquo;re in&#8221; remark at the end of the original story. It will be described as a &#8220;racist comment,&#8221; although I think he was actually referring to the likelihood of an uneducated, low-income workforce. But if he had been referring only to the fading out of Caucasian Texas, I would agree with him wholeheartedly, nevertheless.</p>
<p> Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to just once in a while see a race-related story (anywhere in the news media, not just on AmRen) that hinted that there might be some hope for our kind, that maybe rumors of our upcoming demise, etc., were greatly exaggerated? I don&rsquo;t look for it to happen, though. Too many White people are complacent, and brainwashed, about race   &mdash;   and afraid to speak up and say anything about it, as we do on this website.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if a deep depression with resulting mobs in the streets, prompting a mass exodus from the US, prove this intimidator wrong?</p>
<p>Or, how about a civil war?  </p>
<p>We will know what the future has in store for us sometime this year or the next.  Things will come to a head by then, as the saying goes. </p>
<p>Whether we will have a fight, flight or a permanent Brazil type society, the best bet still is to move to remote areas, like Idaho for those who can.</p>

		<p>A lot will change in The World and in America by 2040. First it&rsquo;ll get horribly worse, then it&rsquo;ll start getting better for Whites but before it does, they will have to be impoverished first because almost all Anglos will tolerate all forms of ethnic masochism but half of them love their money too much to tolerate anything that&rsquo;ll leave them peniless. Then that half will wake up.</p>

		<p>Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, in testimony before a House subcommittee on immigration in January, provides a neat statistical encapsulation of the federal government&rsquo;s success   &mdash;  - over just the 2000-2010 time frame   &mdash;  - in using immigration, legal and illegal, to make it &#8220;bascially all over for Anglos&#8221; nationwide:<br>
					<br>
&#8220;Over the past decade, 13.1 million immigrants (legal and illegal) arrived in the United States, but there was a net decline of one million jobs over the same period. The disconnect between immigration and employment was even more stark over the past two years; according to a report last week from Northeastern University&rsquo;s Center for Labor Market Studies, U.S. household employment declined by 6.26 million, but 1.1 million new immigrants nonetheless got jobs.&#8221; (Mark Krikorian, Executive Director, Center for Immigration Studies<br>
Testimony Before the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement<br>
January 26, 2011)<br>

		<p>I like the way some of the comments over at James Edwards&rsquo;s blog has treated this.  Some of them have noted that for years, Texas politicians like to make fun of California&rsquo;s white liberals, saying that &#8220;it could never happen here, because we&rsquo;re conservative and we have guns unlike you pansies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at what good all their guns did them in the long run.</p>
<p>Then again, as Steve Sailer has explained, Texas&rsquo;s body politic has sort of an arrogant and conceited attitude, that somehow THEY can do &#8220;integration&#8221; with Hispanics &#8220;right&#8221; unlike those &#8220;leftist Hippies&#8221; in California.  Sailer explained there&rsquo;s a long-standing historical reason for it, one which I can&rsquo;t remember, and it would be too verbose for this medium anyway.</p>

<p>Whites are abandoning malls at an unprecedented rate.  Even areas that are over eighty percent white now have malls that are mostly empty with a shopping clientele that&rsquo;s about half non-white.</p>
<p>Areas that are about sixty percent white have malls that are only about twenty percent white.  Whites, by and large, are avoiding malls.  That&rsquo;s not to say that part of it isn&rsquo;t from changing demographics, only that much of it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>Posters #4 and #12 mention how whites are abandoning public spaces such as malls.  I have seen it too where I&rsquo;m at.  Time was you would go to the mall and everyone was basically white.  Now when I go, it&rsquo;s about 50% non-white, and I feel uncomfortable because it looks like another world.  If I wanted to experience other cultures, I would fly to another country and have a vacation.  Now we&rsquo;re on a permanent vacation and it&rsquo;s getting old real fast.  There are fewer and fewer places to experience &#8216;our world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of whites now who are trying to recreate that small town open market experience and they are flocking to small towns for the atmosphere.  I&rsquo;m going to get in on that too.</p>

		<p>On the Mike Gallagher show this morning he spoke about how insulting it was to suggest that the transformation of Texas from European-American (Anglo) to Hispanic would result in a poorer Texas.  How dare a demographer suggest this was a disaster in the making!  If a demographer suggested that an area changing from a white population to black population would result in disaster he would be denounced as a racist.  How dare anyone make a correlation between race and educational achievement and economic success.</p>
<p>Well, Mr. Gallagher was right on one point; to say that a black majority results in disaster does get one called a racist, despite the empirical evidence.  Why there isn&rsquo;t more of an outrage over this statement of coming truth?  Perhaps because no one ever believed there would ever be a black takeover of a major US state?  Or perhaps because the Hispanic takeover of the US was engineered by the elites and is now considered a fate accompli?  That integration and black on white crime was used as a distraction so that we wouldn&rsquo;t catch on to the real intent of the illuminati?  Black integration and the failure of such was also a great source of guilt to keep whites from speaking out against their own dispossession.</p>
<p>Set the blacks lose on the white population and the elites were able to sneak in a third group as, initially, a fifth column and ultimately the &ldquo;new&rdquo; &ldquo;American&rdquo; people.</p>
<p>The collapse of the American Empire is our only hope for survival.  Once things collapse the whites with a will to survive will band together and form a new nation.  Hopefully this nation will learn from the mistakes of this one and perhaps even, eventually, expand once again with a take no prisoners, no more Mr. Nice Guy attitude.<br>

<p>What does guns have to do with a creeping soft invasion?  I&rsquo;ve lived in both Calif and Texas and the white Californians I knew were as well-armed as the Texans and were just as vehement about protecting the second amendment.</p>
<p>A soft invasion of people can&rsquo;t be opposed with guns, but if they start killing Gringos, any white without protection will more than likely be killed.</p>

<p>You know, I&rsquo;m sick and tired of reading comments of this nature.  If this is what some people truly believe, then they should start sending their money to the ADL and get charter memberships in the NAACP.  Because there&rsquo;s no room for roll-over-and-die whimpering among White people who are ready to start fighting back.</p>

		<p>I am surprised by the blunt tone of this article - it very clearly suggests that the demographic changes affecting Texas are BAD, at least for the &#8220;Anglos.&#8221; (&#8220;Its basically over for Anglos&#8221; makes it sound almost apocalyptic, in fact).  The change in Texas these past few decades has been unfathomable.  Take Dallas, for example.  In 1990, it was over 60% non-Hispanic white.  Now, even Dallas COUNTY (which includes many middle class suburbs) is only 36% non-Hispanic white!  That&rsquo;s not a typo - thirty-six percent.  Quite an unprecedented change.</p>
<p>To poster number 12 - I buy most of my clothes at a semi-upscale outdoor mall in a suburb of Austin, and I can attest that there are an awful lot of minorities there at times.  Usually its not so bad, but when I went there a few weeks before Christmas, for some reason it seemed at least 15% of the patrons were Asian Indian!  Not to mention all the other minorities.  Why there would be such a disproportionate number of them, I have no idea.  But I do know that it was very, very strange.</p>

		<p>Unless the trend line changes, 30 percent of the state&rsquo;s labor force will not have even a high school diploma by 2040, he said. And the average household income will be about $6,500 lower than it was in 2000. That figure is not inflation adjusted so it will be worse than what it sounds.</p>
<p>No surprise there.  You take a place and fill it full of Mexicans and it will become Mexico just as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow.  You can make that claim for every race/ethnic group, too.  I still feel it will be worse that what is stated.  </p>
<p>But look further down the road.  Mexicans hate blacks.  They will terrorize them until all blacks are out of Texas.  We will have a black exodus to all other states, much like the industrial revolution in the north.</p>
<p>After that the state WILL NOT secede to Mexico, it would end all public assistance to &#8220;new&#8221; Texans.  After the state is completely bankrupt they will spew across the rest of the country looking for more public assistance until we have a civil war or break up the country.  </p>
<p>It always used to amaze me how much minorities act like Locust swarms.  Guess what?  We are the &#8220;crops&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The advantage Mexicans have over whites in the demography wars is that their men and women haven&rsquo;t been brainwashed by academia, government, and Hollywood into going to war with each other over who&rsquo;s is bigger, who&rsquo;s smarter, and who deserves the bigger paycheck and accolades.   That&rsquo;s why whites are dying out.  Our men and women do not consider themselves on the same team but on opposite teams.  Mexicans don&rsquo;t have their heads filled with such garbage; so they have plenty of kids and often raise them too. </p>

		<p>     You know, now that some are mentioning the business of malls being emptied of Whites, I have noticed that this is happening where I live, even though Whites are still at least 80% of the population.  Why do Whites avoid the malls, even though they might still be the overwhelming majority?  I understand why we avoid non-Whites in general, but, why to this extent, and why malls?  Does anybody have any suggestions?  Thanks.</p>

		<p>Texas and California will very likely become ecocoligical disaster areas that will not be able to sustain large nonwhite populations over the long term.  This will require a cordon sanitaire policy. Cordon off these two large nonwhite states and let them rot. The Whiter States will have to use force and violence at the new borders. I believe they will. But it will occur to Native Born White Americans in the White areas that they should have done this at  the Texas and California borders.</p>
<p>So the big question is:How will  Native Born White Americans  reclaim lost territory? I believe by this time that there will be a massive withdrawal of White support from the Federal goverment.</p>
<p>As Peter Brimelow has written:it is going to be very painfull. </p>
<p>Somehing to think about:What if Native Born White Americans start to increase their fertility level at time when there has been a massive loss of White territory? Native Born White Americans are going to experience enormous pain and suffering in the future..although it could have been avoided.</p>
<p>A tremendous amount of America&rsquo;s natural beauty will be paved over and destroyed. Was the sports entertainment worth it?</p>
<p>I pray for catastrophic events in the very near future, for it is the only way that Native Born White Americans can be shaken back into a concious state from the trance state they are currently in.</p>
<p>But keep this in mind:every White America is going to have to deal with horrfic consequences of race-replacement and massive out-of-control nonwhite population growth. &#8220;America&#8221; is going to be a very unpleasant place to live no matter where you live.</p>
<p>Here is the big paradox. If you were to say to vast majority of Native Born White Americans that &#8220;wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if America&rsquo;s current population size were between one and two an half billion..and wouldn&rsquo;t be wonderfull if we could be affordable housing for mexicans,hindus,sihks,muslims amd Koreans in Yosemenite, The Adirondacks and Yellowstone and in the process paving over these great National and State Parks&#8221;..well they would look at you like you were insane&hellip;but this is the direction America is going..full steam ahead.  There is a massive failure to connect among millions of Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>One problem with articles like this one is the assumption that present events and demographic trends will continue.  Even the use of public-school enrollment as an indicator is partly faulty, since a lot of Southern whites send their children to private schools.  <br>
The message of the left is: Surrender, white America!  <br>

		<p>I agree with an earlier poster.  This article assumes whites won&rsquo;t wake up and fight back.  It assumes the incentives to keep non-whites coming here and procreating out of control will keep going.  It assumes whites won&rsquo;t get a racial backbone and keep blacks and browns in certain areas while gating ourselves away from them.  We&rsquo;re too negative.  I can&rsquo;t even stand to be around other pro-white (conservatives) who complain and say, &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to be a minority&#8221; or ones who complain about &#8220;China owning us all.&#8221;  What are you going to constructively and intelligently do about it?

<p>I predict, sadly, that many whites are going to take the easy route and join the other side. They will not be on our side. We cannot count on them.  Many will marry non-whites, as they are already doing right now, sniffing the wind&rsquo;s direction I suppose.</p>

		<p>The reason that whites do not fight back is that they are decent and not confrontation seeking like others and their upbringing is good and moderate,they come from families which are by and large ethical,they do not like violence and are career minded, rather than get into fight with somebody and put themselves in trouble.</p>

		<p>As post 32 and a few others have pointed out-as Peter Brimelow recently pointed out-Native Born White Americans have yet to flex their political muscle. As I mentioned in my previous post in this thread, their is a massive failure to connect with the obvious in the brains of millions of Native Born White Americans. I mean, just think about it for a moment. You can say with great certainty that Native Born White Americans would not want a US population of a billion..with a massive amount of demographic momentum built in thereby generting decades of further growth for decades to come. Not only that, the &#8220;America&#8221; of one billion and a half Americans will be largely nonwhite. All the amenities such as open space,miles and miles of unpoiled naural beauty, crystal clear mountain streams and waterfalls will be wiped out. Life for millions of Native Born White Americans will be hellish. This is kind of hellish Blade Runner dystopia that millions of our fellow Native Born White Americans can&rsquo;t mentally connect post-1965 legal immigrants with.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor in his public appearances has to-with a laser beam focus-connect the two. This is way more important than the overpopulation-energy issue that he mentioned in his Charlotte speech. The pitch that Jared Taylor, Peter Brimelow and Richard Spencer have to make to Native Born White Americans has got to be fundamentally about asking our fellow Native Born White Americans what they are willing to give to accomodate importing millions of post-1965 high fertility Muslims,Hispanics,Asians,Carribeans and Africans. Millions of Native Born White Americans have never even thought about  nonwhite immigration in these stark terms..if they did, they would begin to feel deep fear in the pit of their stomachs. This has got to be our new strategy&hellip;ask them what they are willing to give up.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s over for Anglos in Texas because only 33.3 percent of the students enrolled in public schools are White?  Well, if Texans are like the rest of us then there are large numbers of White students enrolled in private institutions.  By the way how many of those hispanic students are really illegal?  Eight percent is the national average so your telling me that Texas, which has the second largest Mexican population in the country, is right at the national average?  Yeah, right.

		<p>This is a demographic disaster in the making for several reasons.  The growing hispanic population will eventually bankrupt the state, which will increase taxes and drive away jobs. Many hispanics will go out in search of greener pastures in other states and repeat the cycle over again.  The hispanic majority will drive out many of the 3 million or so blacks living in the state and they&rsquo;ll end up settling in other parts of the South.  Others will leave once they find out they can&rsquo;t leach off the hispanics the way they did &#8220;whitey&#8221;.    </p>

<p>A Euphemism is &ldquo;a substitution for an expression or word that may offend or suggest something unpleasant to the receiver&rdquo;.</p>

Especially when anglo refers only to Anglo Saxons. Italo-Americans, Franco- Americans, German Americans, Slavic Americans, Irish Americans and Scottish Americans,Ibero- Americans ( Spain and Portugal), Greco- Americans, Scando- Americans are not Anglos but we are all White.<br>
I partially blame the Immigration act of 19?? sponsored by the &#8220;diver&#8221; Ted Kennedy. Practically all Euro immigration to this country was cut off and the floodgates were opened to the detritus of the Third World so many of whom came for only material gain and never to become true Americans.</p>
<p>It took centuries to bring about the dissolution of the great empires of the world and less than 50 years to &#8220;fundamentally transform&#8221; the great United States while we sat by and let it happen.<br>

		<p>I agree with Juggernaut.  The younger minority population will never agree to support the aging population.  They won&rsquo;t be able to anyway.  They won&rsquo;t be paying enough federal taxes.  And the fight is on already anyway.  Whatever you may think of Medicare, notice Obama wants to cut billions from it, while giving millions more people Medicaid.  Most of the people on Medicare are white and Obama&rsquo;s constituency uses Medicaid.  This past weekend, the white-hating Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal Constitution was complaining about the elderly white-haired people on Medicare.  We know what she means by white-haired.</p>
<p>Is there anything we can do about future demographics?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  Not much will be done about illegals and I haven&rsquo;t yet heard one elected politician, not even a conservative, talk about reducing legal immigration.  If they won&rsquo;t do it during a recession where millions of jobs have been lost, then when will they ever.  Other than Pat Buchanan, I know of no other well-known conservative who talks about reducing legal immigration.</p>

		<p>I know that some folks here believe that secession is a long term solution for Native Born White American racial survival. To me, this is very far from obvious.</p>
<p>The new nonwhite post-1965 race-based nation states in the future are going to be ecological disaster areas. Post-1965 nonwhites aren&rsquo;t comming to America to limit their fertility&hellip;just the opposite. There will be massive out of control population growth. All the garbage,pollution and disease won&rsquo;t decide to stop at the border of the new White Homeland..unless there is a new law of physics that I am unaware of. You can be absolutely certain that from day one that there will be a very high level of tension at the new borders..because by this time White Americans will do what the should have done years ago&hellip;militarize the border. A war between the nonwhite nations and the new White Nation is inevitable.  What a shock it will be to millions of Native Born White Americans when they  realize as Dorothy said to Toto:&#8221;Toto I don&rsquo;t think we are in Kansas anymore&#8221;. You got that right Dorothy.</p>
<p>One of the things I would ask my fellow White folks is:how much living space-and the technological,military and educationional resources that comes with these territories- in America are you willing to give up to Mexico,Korea,China,Pakistan,India,Iran,Vietnam and Nigeria&hellip;for the resources of California will be only for the benefit of aforementioned post-1965 nonwhite genelines&hellip;o benefit for the geneline of Native Born White Americans&hellip;how much more of White American living space are you willing to give up to these nonwhite nations-how far are you willing to let the genetic borders of these nonwhite nations extend into America- for racial minority status within the borders of America? A lot of corny Fox News Americana nonesense will be shattered&hellip;obliterated&hellip;.what would be the point of celebrating July 4th anymore? </p>

How much are we willing to give up?  The answer should be none.  That isn&rsquo;t to say we shouldn&rsquo;t contemplate pulling back for a while.  Once a homeland nation has been formed and consolidated, we can simply bide our time and then take back what is ours when the opportunity presents itself.  </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think non-whites will be able to feed their massive population without our help, do you?  We&rsquo;ve already seen how likely that is, with what happened in Rhodesia and South Africa.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;ve read Dr. Michael Hart&rsquo;s excellent book you&rsquo;ll know that throughout history a population of high IQ can easily defeat a much, much larger population of lower IQ.</p>
<p>See whites in Africa or Latin America during earlier centuries.<br>
The original Aryans conquered all of India which even back then had a huge population. And they were no more than 1 % of the population.</p>
<p>White Americans in the age group that matter, under 40, are still a solid majority. If there&rsquo;s a conflict then liberal whites will quickly learn that blacks make no distinction between liberal and conservative, much to their chagrin.</p>
<p>And believe me, there will be a conflict. We&rsquo;re at peak oil. </p>
<p>It will be worst in the beginning as the process of unwinding 60 years of steady europhobic propaganda from an unrelenting MSM afraid of white people(essentially Jews, my people, afraid of a new Nazi Germany springing up) will be bloody. </p>
<p>So the reason why it will look worse than it is in the beginning is because so many whites live in denial and no matter how smart you are, if you simply refuse to fight then you will get killed.</p>
<p>Once that phase is over, which will probably be over quickly, then we will enter a place where there will be a counterattack.</p>
<p>And whites have the only thing that matters: the control of the army, overwhelming numbers of marines and so forth, retired and not. And add to that an armed population which will not be attacked, and probably supported, by the army once the shift has taken place.</p>
<p>What will happen then is simply a defeat for the other forces, and that may include Mexico.</p>
<p>There will probably be major population declines but much more severe for the other side.</p>
<p>The result will be a smaller, but much more homogenous and powerful, tight-knitted America arisen from the ashes.</p>
<p>But the process to get there will be stained by blood, terror and tears. But it will be reached. And don&rsquo;t discount your European brethren in Canada as well in Europe(which is already overpopulated, and frankly, has much less of these problems although they are concentrated to big cities).</p>
