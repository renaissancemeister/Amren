<h1><a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1904/poll-illegal-immigration-border-security-path-to-citizenship &mdash; birthright-citizenship-arizona-law">Public Favors Tougher Border Controls and Path to Citizenship</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pew Research Center Publication, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press, conducted Feb. 2-7 among 1,385 adults, finds that in dealing with illegal immigration 42% say the priority should be to tighten border security and more strictly enforce immigration laws, but at the same time also create a way for people here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain conditions. Somewhat fewer (35%) put priority only on better border security and stronger enforcement, while 21% say the priority should be to find a way for illegal immigrants to become citizens.</p>
<p>At the same time, the public remains supportive of Arizona&rsquo;s controversial immigration law. Roughly six-in-ten (61%) approve of the law, which would require police to verify the legal status of someone stopped or arrested, if the police suspect that person is in the country illegally. These opinions, like other attitudes about illegal immigration, are little changed from last summer.</p>
<p>While the job situation remains the public&rsquo;s biggest economic worry, jobs are not people&rsquo;s top concern when it comes to illegal immigration. Four-in-ten (40%) say their biggest concern is that illegal immigration places a burden on government services; 27% say their biggest concern is that it hurts American jobs. Far fewer say their biggest concerns are that illegal immigration contributes to crime (9%) or hurts America&rsquo;s customs and its way of life.</p>
<p>Pew Research&rsquo;s annual policy priorities survey in January found that dealing with illegal immigration remains a middle-tier public concern. About half (46%) said it was a top policy priority, placing it far behind the economy (87%), jobs (84%) and a number of other issues.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Opinions about &#8220;Birthright Citizenship&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Conservatives in Congress and several state legislatures have proposed legislation to stop granting U.S. citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants, though many legal scholars say this will require a constitutional amendment. The poll finds that a 57%-majority of the public opposes such a constitutional amendment, while 39% favor it. This balance of opinion is essentially unchanged from last year or 2006, when 42% favored changing the constitution and 54% opposed doing so.</p>
<p>Opposition to a constitutional amendment is particularly strong among Hispanics (73%) and people younger than age 30 (also 73%). About half of whites (52%) oppose such a change (vs. 43% who favor it), and seniors are divided (45% in favor, 48% opposed).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Arizona Law Still Broadly Supported</b></p>
<p>A solid majority of Americans (61%) continues to approve of the immigration law passed last year in Arizona that requires police to verify the legal status of anyone they detain if they suspect that the person is in the country illegally; 34% disapprove of this law.</p>
<p>Approval of the Arizona law is essentially unchanged from June of last year.</p>
<p>The Arizona law is supported by 72% of whites, but only 42% of blacks and just 27% of Hispanics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Top Concerns about Illegal Immigration</b></p>
<p>Asked to choose among four options, 40% of the public say their biggest concern about illegal immigration is the burden it places on government services.</p>
<p>About a quarter (27%) say their biggest concern is the impact on jobs, while fewer cite the impact of illegal immigration on crime (9%) and America&rsquo;s customs and its way of life (6%).</p>
<p>While there is broad concern about the burden that illegal immigration places on government services, African Americans, young people and people with less education are particularly concerned about the impact on jobs. In each of these groups at least as many cite jobs as the burden on government services as their biggest concern about illegal immigration.</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s the problem. As Larry Auster puts it in his current blog:<br>
 <i><br>
Or, to put the same idea in more direct and brutal terms: the highest liberal principle is the destruction of white America. That principle transcends any concern about blacks&rsquo; economic well-being &mdash; even for the blacks themselves.</i> </p>
<p><i>People who think that they can win the argument for reduced immigration on the basis of the economic well-being of blacks and other such liberal concerns are delusional, because they don&rsquo;t recognize what actually drives the support for open borders.</i></p>
<p>If whites won&rsquo;t oppose immigration as genocide then they won&rsquo;t oppose it at all.  If they can&rsquo;t be moved to defend their own culture for its own sake then they&rsquo;re finished.  And contrary to what this poll says whites understand that the real problem is that America is becoming a third-world dump.  They&rsquo;re just brainwashed and in fear of the establishment and that they&rsquo;ll lose their wealth and status if they do anything to oppose the program. </p>

		<p><i>It&rsquo;s ready made and waiting for their full support WITHOUT our money. How do they explain this?</i></p>
<p>They explain it by immediately signing up for and receiving free medical care, subsidized housing, free educations for their many offspring, jobs paying $10/hour in cash, food stamps, welfare services, a chance for citizenship for any and all anchor babies, a welcome mat from the American government AND they get to bash whites at the same time, all in their own language, no English required!  What&rsquo;s not to love?</p>
<p>These things are not afforded them in Mexico, only poverty, anarchy and murder.</p>
<p><i>I simply do not understand people risking life, fortune, freedom and loss of family to leave a placeand then attempt to recreate what you just left. It has got to be the highmark of total insanity.</i></p>
<p>It has nothing to do with insanity and everything to do with recreating what they just left using money provided by white taxpayers while the American government either turns a blind eye or puts out the welcome mat.  And, you have the inherent right, backed up by the American government to call any complaining, whining white American who supports your lazy lifestyle a Nazi and bigot.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what my choices are as an uneducated peasant in Mexico:  Rolling heads across the disco floor or a taxpayer-subsidized life in America with government-protected status and favoritism over the natives?   </p>

		<p>The Romans built Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall almost 1900 years ago, why can&rsquo;t we?  This is not news.  People want one thing, but politicians do another.  This been a trend since before I was born.  People are used to not being heard by their leaders, like leaders are used to not listening to their people.</p>
<p>The way politicians think is that if they don&rsquo;t get elected, they will next time.  People flip-flip too much.  If the Democrats disappointed me, next time I&rsquo;ll vote Republican.  After that term the Republicans disappointed me, I&rsquo;ll vote Democrat next time.</p>
<p>Politicians take turns running the country and KNOW IT!  They don&rsquo;t listen to people anymore, they just wait their turn to line their pockets.  </p>
<p>vote third party people!  Aside from war, it is the only way we will be here next century.</p>

		<p>These polls are almost unecessary since the results are a foregone conclusion. Asking Hispanics whether or not they favor tighter immigration would be like asking blacks whether they favor affirmative action, or asking an obese man whether or not he favors the opening of a McDonald&rsquo;s in his neighborhood. It&rsquo;s not about what is morally (or legally) right. It is about spoils.</p>
<p>There was an article in the New York Times recently that said over 70% of americans held extreme views on the subject of immigration. Note to New York Times, if 70% say something, that&rsquo;s a consensus, a majority, so perhaps you should amend your definition of &#8220;extreme&#8221; and not define it as what the majority of Americans want, but rather what a small clique of editors and copywriters want.</p>

		<p>The first graph of the original article reads, </p>
<p><i>The public continues to favor tough measures to crack down on illegal immigration. Yet Americans see no contradiction in supporting both stepped-up border security and a way for people already in the United States illegally to gain citizenship.</i></p>
<p>Even PEW recognizes the contradiction. The last time the US gave an &#8220;amnesty&#8221; the number of illegals exploded in anticipation of <i>another</i> one. One can&rsquo;t have both enforcement and amnesty. They are opposites.</p>

		<p>This poll only used the replies of a very small number of people. Judging from the blogs, there are many more who would argue with the path to citizenship for people who laugh at our laws. Illegals should never, ever have the chance to become citizens. Do the open borders groups think that waving that magic wand will suddenly turn criminals into law-abinding, taxpaying, red, white and blue waving Americans? We have become a nation of UNenforced laws.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Conservatives in Congress and several state legislatures have proposed legislation to stop granting U.S. citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants, though many legal scholars say this will require a constitutional amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The argument that a constitutional amendment would be necessary to end &#8216;birth right citizenship&rsquo; fails to take into account the legislative history of the 14th amendment and the time and the context in which it was written and ratified.The 14th amendment was one of the three reconstruction amendments. The clause in the amendment was intended to guarantee former slaves full rights of citizenship. The amendment also disenfranchised a large segment of the white southern population.</p>
<p>Judges and legislators have been treating the 14th like it was a miniature or second U S Constitution for over a century,basing a large body of law and judicial decisions on the amendment. I have found nothing in the precedents which would prevent the state legislatures or Congress from enacting laws to outlaw instant citizenship to children of illegals`. Honestly the best way to deal with the problem is simply to repeal it. That way activist judges and left wing politicians won&rsquo;t have as effective a weapon to fight back with.</p>
<p>Several legal scholars have also presented highly convincing arguments that the 14th was illegally ratified and therefor not officially a part of the Constitution.    </p>

		<p>The way to get places in politics is to get in front of a popular issue. Supporting more restrictions on immigration is an issue where American Renaissance can come to the attention of more Americans and sell more subscriptions to its magazine.<br>

One does not get places in politics by changing people&rsquo;s minds. One gets places by articulating and channeling sentiments that already exist. </p>

		<p>People naturally have different opinions about what a &#8220;path to citizenship&#8221; means.  But the ideas that have been proposed by legislators are so stringent that few ignorant, non-law-abiding aliens would even attempt to pursue them.</p>

		<p>I was surprised to see the low support for the Arizona immigration law among blacks. One reason could be that many blacks have criminal records themselves and, therefore, don&rsquo;t think anything of the lawlessness of the illegal aliens invading our country.</p>
<p>They should, though. If hispanics should obtain more and more positions of power in this country, the hispanics will not treat the blacks any better than the whites.</p>

		<p>I would be willing to bet that the majority of people for amnesty, are mexicans. By this time next year the people who oppose it will be higher and the following year will be higher yet! Keep allowing illegals into the country, it won&rsquo;t be long before they are running(and ruining) our country.Then we will be just like the trashed country of mexico. How about we invade mexico and make it a democracy like iraq? Maybe then the illegal immigration would stop.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m surprised at the slim support from blacks.  As far as they are concerned anything that limits the numbers of whites has to be a good thing.  They fail to see how the Hispanic influx has totally undermined blacks, particularly in the Southern states.  This leaves them vulnerable since they become mired in public assistance instead of building a black-based infrastructure.<br>
