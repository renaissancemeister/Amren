			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elie Mystal, Above the Law, February 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>We all know how important the U.S. News Law School Rankings are to our system of legal education. The jobs of law school deans depend on the rankings, and they therefore significantly impact what law schools are willing or able to do. {snip}<br>
Given the importance of U.S. News, I understand why diversity proponents want the publication to start counting &#8220;diversity&#8221; as a data point when compiling the annual rankings. {snip}</p>
<p>A story in the National Law Journal highlights a proposal from the The State Bar of California to U.S. News rankings guru Bob Morse. They want &#8220;diversity&#8221; to account for 15% of the overall U.S. News rank for schools.</p>
<p>The immediate question I have is &#8220;what the hell do you mean by &#8216;diversity&rsquo;?&#8221; So now I have something in common with Bob Morse:<blockquote>However, devising a credible measure of diversity is easier said than done, said U.S. News director of data and research Bob Morse. He has yet to see the council&rsquo;s proposal, which is scheduled to be completed in the spring, but one of the problems that consistently crops up in diversity discussions is that there is no clear way to compare the diversity of a student body of a school in an ethically diverse state such as California to the diversity in a largely white state such as Kansas.</p>
<p>&#8220;What benchmark do you use?&#8221; Morse said. &#8220;To us, that&rsquo;s not a little point. Should it be relative to the population of the state? How do you deal with private schools? Would the benchmark for UCLA and Michigan be the state they are in, or would it be national? It would be a very sophisticated analysis.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>As many of you know, I believe that diversity is a positive educational good in its own right. I believe that all else being equal, most intelligent deans would want to have a diverse student body because a diverse student body leads to better education for all of the students.</p>
<p>The problem with U.S. News (if there is one) is that all else <em>is not</em> equal, because U.S. News places way too much importance on LSAT scores. The LSAT measures past achievement, not future success. It can&rsquo;t measure future success because there&rsquo;s no way to account for how a person will react if he or she is able to secure a new opportunity.</p>
<p>If you want to increase the diversity of law schools, then attacking the LSAT is a much more direct method than pumping up some kind of tortured &#8220;diversity score.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The council&rsquo;s proposal recommends reducing the weight of the quality assessment to 20%, and reducing the weight of selectivity to 20%, in part by lowering the weight of the median LSAT score. Placement success would remain at 20% while faculty resources would increase to 20%. A new category of academic support for students would account for 5% of rankings.</p>
<p>The biggest change, however, would be the addition of a new diversity category that would evaluate what schools are doing to promote diversity on campus.<blockquote>&#8220;Diversity assessments should not be limited to admissions and student body demographics,&#8221; the proposal reads. &#8220;Instead, diversity should also be measured by the support and resources provided by the institution to foster an inclusive culture and climate in which students from diverse backgrounds can excel.&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} I don&rsquo;t want to pretend that a magazine can rank the &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221; of a law school campus. It can&rsquo;t and any &#8220;results&#8221; will be compromised by the futility of the effort.</p>

		<p>We want everything ranked by diversity.</p>
<p>Whites will know to stay away.</p>
<p>Whites who &#8220;embrace diversity&#8221; will be pressured by us to &#8220;take their diversity into non diverse, overwhelmingly black institutions&#8221;. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get rid of our liberal Whites by sacrificing their self-hating stupidity on the altar of diversity.  If they want to level themselves with the blacks, then let&rsquo;s force into the black communities.</p>
<p>Helps us and helps them.  We get rid of a nuisance, and they learn something about blacks.</p>
<p>Equality means White Humanity&rsquo;s lowering itself down to level of blacks. Let&rsquo;s not allow any White to enjoy the benefits of Whiteness while believing they are equal to blacks.  We must make equality become a reality for White race traitors.</p>
<p>You really do know what&rsquo;s coming&hellip;   Look out 10 years from now- what do you see- anything so big between now and 2022 that America is no longer a Union, but all broken up along color lines?   Won&rsquo;t the anti White violence make that inevitable, and isn&rsquo;t the violence against us increasing, along with our awareness of it?</p>
<p>At least the Internet has helped us to this point.  Do what you can to spread the news far and wide, because the politicians will not allow the Internet to continue with &#8220;anti-democratic hate speech&#8221;.  We are targeted.  Prepare.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor has more work to do&hellip;  We all do&hellip;<br>

		<p>The author singles out LSAT scores, but several other factors U.S. News uses in computing its rankings, including undergraduate GPA, post-graduate employment rates, bar passage rates, and alumni donation rates also favor schools with &#8220;low diversity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I accept no idea at face value.</p>
<p>You expect me to believe this stuff you are going to have to prove it.</p>
<p>This is why your people are at the bottom. </p>
<p>You believe in ridiculous appeals to magic like &#8220;diversity&#8221; rather than enforcing standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with U.S. News (if there is one) is that all else is not equal, because U.S. News places way too much importance on LSAT scores.

<p>Really?</p>
<p>Then why do those with the highest LSAT scores end up earning the most?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re full of it.</p>

<p>As the little man once said on Diff&rsquo;rent Strokes, whatchya talkin about Willis?  How is the way a person reacts to &#8220;securing a new opportunity,&#8221; (again, watchya talkin about Willis?) relevant to his or her chops as an attorney?</p>
<p>Does this mean that white lawyers looking to make partner at a prominent firm (lotsaluck with that these days) who are given important work, whose reaction might be to high-five each other, aren&rsquo;t really good lawyers because they wouldn&rsquo;t scream and shriek and dance around in circles like black women of the same circumstance getting the same job?</p>

		<p>I am an Asian who worked at a senior level in an American multinational corporation for 30 years. I have worked in 9 countries, and have interacted extensively with white elites. White elites are the most racially prejudiced people I have ever met. In corporate America, they bleat about &#8220;diversity&#8221; in public. But behind closed doors, they make extremely bigoted remarks about non-whites, that would shock the most hardened Klansman. The only thing that exceeds the bigotry of white elites toward non-whites, is their extreme selfishness.</p>
<p>Of course, ordinary white Americans and white Europeans know of the exclusive country clubs that are frequented by white elites, which deny membership to non-whites, Jews, and average white people. The question you will ask, is why white elites promote so much multi-racialism and multi-culturalism propaganda, when they do not allow non-whites in their country clubs. You also want to ask why white elites are so fiercely opposed to the white nationalism of average whites in America and Europe. The answer is very simple.</p>
<p>The white elites fear that, if racial nationalism becomes acceptable in America and Europe, then non-whites in other countries will start organizing themselves on racial-nationalist principles. Corporate executives associate racial nationalism in the third world, with the nationalization of subsidiaries of Western multinational corporations in third world countries.</p>
<p>As one corporate executive told me, whites control 4 of the 6 continents of the world - North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. In the 2 continents that are not ruled by whites, Asia and Africa, most of the mines and oil fields are owned by subsidiaries of Western corporations. The multi-racialism and multi-cultural propaganda, is meant to confuse non-white elites who study at Harvard, Oxford, and other elite white institutions, and prevent them from advancing the racial interests of their people. It is those confused and corrupt elites that are now being thrown out of power in the Arab countries.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say, is that white elites, in business, politics, and academia, are white supremacists in the true definition of that term. They are not satisfied in merely ruling over whites, in white countries. They are also determined to maintain their economic and political control, of non-white people living in third world countries.</p>
<p>This is why they sponsor third world immigration to the West. They want to prevent the rise of white nationalist governments in white countries, as well as racial nationalist governments in third world countries. This explains their propaganda war against nationalist governments, such as those of Milosevic&rsquo;s Serbia, and Putin&rsquo;s Russia.</p>
<p>Average white people have no idea how greedy and evil white elites are. They sent ordinary whites to die in several useless wars in the 20th century, simply to make money by financing and supplying the war effort. They also sponsor several wars in the third world, in order to advance their corporate interests, and profit from the wars. I recommend that all Americans read the important book by the great American hero, Major General Smedley Butler, who wrote the book, &#8220;War is a Racket&#8221;. Here is a wikipedia article on the book:   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Is_a_Racket</a>    </p>

		<p>This could be a useful analytical tool for prospective law school applicants and their parents.</p>
<p>The higher the school ranks in terms of diversity the lower it should rank in terms of educational value for a law career.</p>

		<p>Unless a college is prestigious and has lots of international students (in which case, they can select the intellectual elites of races that are, on the whole, rather unintelligent), &#8220;diversity&#8221; will likely negatively correlate with factors such as post-graduation earnings potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white elites fear that, if racial nationalism becomes acceptable in America and Europe, then non-whites in other countries will start organizing themselves on racial-nationalist principles.&#8221;<br>
Except for one problem: pretty much all non-white countries already do that, to a certain extent. It&rsquo;s really all a matter of degree, that is, if they are willing to tolerate investments by whites in their countries in the short run to improve economic growth. The ones who are most strident, of course, are folks like Mugabe, who suicidally kicked out the whites who kept his country&rsquo;s economy humming along, even in the face of massive government corruption and waste.</p>
