<h1>What Is &#8216;Black&rsquo; to You?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Albert McWilliams, Yale Daily News (New Haven), February 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This year, the Black Student Alliance at Yale is working on a project intended to collect thoughts about &#8220;Blackness&#8221; at Yale University on the following blog: yaleblackness.tumblr.com.</p>
<p>The purpose of the &#8220;Yale Blackness&#8221; project is to give Yale students a medium to offer their thoughts on race and culture at Yale University. Like many organizations on campus, the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY) recognizes the potential for &#8220;new media&#8221; to begin a dialogue on racial dynamics on college campuses. Anonymity is a powerful tool, and when used appropriately and respectfully, it can provoke students to offer powerful insight. Ultimately, BSAY hopes to use this raised awareness to incite action to dispel negative myths, improve race relations within Yale&rsquo;s student population and take advantage of Yale&rsquo;s diverse population.</p>
<p>In order to compile these thoughts and comments, BSAY asked Yale students to take two or three minutes, and answer the following question in an anonymous post of 50 words or less: What are your feelings about &#8220;Blackness&#8221; at Yale University? This question is intentionally broad, and has produced responses ranging from issues such as dynamics in Black organizations to interracial dating at Yale. Over 150 responses have been collected, and seven to 10 responses will be posted each day between now and the first week of March. Below you will find some of the 150 responses we have received:</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel left out when I see black kids only hanging out with other black kids. Like I&rsquo;m not allowed to approach. Is that racist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackness is not united here; it is clear that a lot of black people chose their one black group and that&rsquo;s it or they choose to not participate in any black groups  &mdash;  not because they&rsquo;re not &#8216;black&rsquo; but rather they probably enjoy the activities that they choose to do more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yale is far more integrated than my high school, and I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for that. I&rsquo;ve met some awesome black kids here, which is great. I&rsquo;m sometimes jealous of black freshmen who get black upperclassmen watching out for them. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing, but I wish someone would watch out for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the Af-Am center does good outreach, but I feel like the black students tend to only hang out with each other, much like some other groups on campus. I know I unfairly judge black students because of bad experiences I had in high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that we as a society, and as a Yale community, spend too much time defining diversity by race and skin color. Racial groups  &mdash;  including much of the Black community  &mdash;  become closed circles of friends and sometimes can be seen as a group quite separate from the community as a whole. As an entire community we should recognize diversity more broadly  &mdash;  diversity of thought, diversity of background, diversity of passions  &mdash;  so perhaps with a new outlook on similarities and differences, and a conscious effort to mix races, we can achieve a more cohesive, diverse student body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do black students need an &#8216;alliance&rsquo; at Yale? And if they&rsquo;re allied, WHO are the enemies? The insularity of a recognizable portion of (but not all) black students at Yale that is not really interested in hanging out with anyone who is not black is annoying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a white writer, my sense is that race at Yale is in a healthy spot. While some friend groups are racially homogenous, most are diverse. Segregation doesn&rsquo;t seem to be more serious for African-Americans at Yale than any other ethnic group. What worries me is my relationship to race in New Haven. I find that I have become more prejudiced since moving to New Haven. I don&rsquo;t mean racist. I mean prejudiced. I find myself noticing blackness more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Race relations on the surface may seem healthy at Yale, but based on my experience and the experiences of others, I feel like the dating preferences of white students in particular are all too often exclusive against individuals of color. I find it hard to believe such a phenomenon among this particular racial enclave at Yale is just too pervasive to be dismissed as coincidence. Some students would benefit from taking a hard look at the underlying reasons for why they choose not to date outside their own race.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about blackness at Yale. I&rsquo;m biracial and it&rsquo;s hard to fit in with the Af-Am house, or so it feels. People at Yale don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m black, but that doesn&rsquo;t erase history. People at Yale ignore America&rsquo;s problems, but they still lurk beneath the surface.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to become the Huey Newton of the 21st century by the time I leave Yale for two reasons. Firstly, a lot of white people I interact with are clueless and I&rsquo;m losing patience. Secondly, my professors (and friends) have intense white guilt and an empowering love for black culture beyond trite exoticization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackness is both community and isolation. It is respect, but condescension. It is being accepted in word, and ignored in deed. Being Black at Yale is still being Black.&#8221;<br>

		<p><i>Why do black students need an &lsquo;alliance&rsquo; at Yale? And if they&rsquo;re allied, WHO are the enemies?</i></p>
<p>Good question.  The answer is that they need to be allied against the evil white bigot professors and TAs who have the audacity to think that they should learn what they&rsquo;re trying to teach them, and that they should receive grades based on the work they submit.</p>

		<p>To me, an outsider, blackness seems to define ONLY those who adopt the victim mindset, the entitlement consciousness, that exists primarily in the black ghetto.  Being black means the world owes the black person a living.  Being black means that when adversity strikes, the black person sits on his or her rear and does nothing for him/herself, but instead demands help from other people, from the City, from the State, and from the Feds.  I don&rsquo;t think &#8220;blackness&#8221; is a real positive thing.  It has been presented to us whites as an immature, self-centered, and also violent type of viewpoint, and I personally want to stay as far away from it as I can.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Blackness&#8221; to me is a thing that, when it&rsquo;s not there, you don&rsquo;t notice any absence at first.  You notice only that everything feels calmer, quieter, less tense &amp; more civilized. Only after a while does it occur to you, hey, there are no blacks here, that must be why it&rsquo;s so pleasant.   </p>

		<p>So if diversity is such a strength, what&rsquo;s all the fuss about here?  Seems odd to me, what with diversity being a strength and all, that lengthy articles like this one talking about the Black experience would be all that necessary.  Right?  I mean, diversity IS our strength right?</p>

In the interest of fairness and a proper framing of the answers, why not run parallel questions to members of other groups such as Latinos, Asians and whites.  Or better yet, add a section for Asians, as well as other groups, to disclose what they think it is like to be Black at Yale.</p>

 <br>
This is very telling.  I bet they really are shocked to discover this.  Why?  Because they are fed a continual stream of multicultural lies from birth.  By the time they get to a REAL place like college or boot camp they are shocked to discover that 3/4 of their television-based education was a fantasy.  It&rsquo;s also pretty obvious where this particular student&rsquo;s priorities lie.<br>
  <br>
It&rsquo;s refreshing to hear that college-aged white women are wise enough to see the lies for what they are.  I&rsquo;d wager a good portion of them already had their eyes opened in their &#8220;diverse&#8221; high school.  An advantage to public schooling is that your children get to see the bull first hand.  So when you have to send them off to college, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about their priorities.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s as simple as not wanting their own race to become extinct.  Of all the world&rsquo;s major racial groups the one that is diminishing most rapidly in both percentage terms and soon in absolute numbers is the white race.  Every white nation is being inundated by massive numbers of non-white immigrants and the only differences among, say, the United States, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, France, Italy, or Germany is in which decade of this century whites become a minority.  By contrast, there is no chance that any sub-Saharan African country will ever be anything but overwhelmingly black, there is no chance that China will ever be anything but overwhelmingly Chinese, and there is no chance that Mexico will be anything but overwhelmingly Mestizo.</p>

<p><br>
This is fascinating. The writer   &mdash;   presumably a black male   &mdash;   wants to &#8220;become the Huey Newton of the 21st century&#8221; because of his experiences at Yale. Because the white people there are MEAN to him? No   &mdash;   because the white people there are TOO NICE to him. </p>
<p>Because Yale&rsquo;s white people refuse to accept their &#8220;guilt&#8221; for America&rsquo;s &#8220;racism&#8221; against blacks? No   &mdash;   because Yale&rsquo;s white people acknowledge their guilt TOO MUCH. </p>
<p>Because white Yalies have an interest in black culture that is no more than &#8220;trite exoticization&#8221;? No   &mdash;   because white Yalies have &#8220;an empowering love&#8221; for black culture.  </p>
<p>IOW, this young black male   &mdash;   and one of the smarter ones, based on his grammar and spelling   &mdash;   has been radicalized into an angry &#8220;Black Panther&#8221; type because in 2011 white people at his college behave in all the forgiving, indulgent, brotherly-love kinds of ways that the Civil Rights Movement TOLD white people to behave. </p>
<p>In the &rsquo;60s, whites were told that if we just started treating blacks better, then blacks would treat us better&hellip; which would eventually lead to a withering away of the old hatreds on both sides&hellip; and then a rainbow-flavored Age of Aquarius would truly be upon us. </p>
<p>Instead, this student demonstrates that the effect has been the exact OPPOSITE. Indulgence doesn&rsquo;t pacify, apparently; rather, it only aggravates. </p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;d like Yale to put to their students of all colors: </p>
<p><i>If the old approach of whites being mean to blacks didn&rsquo;t bring about the racial harmony of a color-blind society&hellip; </i></p>
<p>And if the new approach of whites being nice to blacks ALSO doesn&rsquo;t bring about the racial harmony of a color-blind society&hellip; </p>
<p>Then what reason is there to believe that ANYTHING will do the trick?</p>

<p>Sounds to me like a very good reason not to produce any more mulattoes, kid.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;a lot of white people I interact with are clueless and I&rsquo;m losing patience.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>So are we. Very quickly.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This year, the Black Student Alliance at Yale is working on a project intended to collect thoughts about &ldquo;Blackness&rdquo; at Yale University&hellip;</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>And what did the <i>White</i> Student Alliance have to say about &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; at Yale?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right  &mdash;  only nonWhites are permitted to notice their own race.</p>
<p>Stop whining, blacks.  If living among Whitey is so painful, there&rsquo;s an entire continent filled with your own kind, where you can find your dream. Of course, Africa is a little short on the White girls who seem so essential to your happiness, but I guess that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for getting in touch with your Inner Blackness, right? </p>
<p>Marcus Garvey was right.<br>
