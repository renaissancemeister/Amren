<p>One person was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, he said. Video evidence is being collected for the investigation, Thornton said. No other details were available because the case is under investigation.</p>

		<p>This college should be shut down NOW.  NO ONE will convince me that anyone there is getting a useful education.  No white with any sense would attend.  My wife left her public high school in 1977 in Los Angeles County when this sort of stuff started happening there.  I can&rsquo;t imagine a better image to illustrate Obama&rsquo;s America.</p>

		<p>Just another day in Obama&rsquo;s black America. Is this what it means when &#8220;the roosters have come home to roost&#8221;?<br>
This is typical of blacks at any school across this great country. They are not there to learn or develop skills needed to survive in the &#8220;real&#8221; world. They are there to party, have a good time and hook-up with some white women and start trouble. More proof they need their own cities &hellip;far away from us.</p>

This video is an anamoly in Black behavior  &mdash;  -Blacks are well organized, behaved, always reading Plato and Aristotle, and preparing for the future as physicists or doctors.

		<p>If you drive from State up to north Alabama, much nicer to me than the Black Belt, you may come to the town of Florence where you will find  Rosenbaum House, one of Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s finest Usonians.  Historians have noted that it is of perfect size (actually, I think it was enlarged at a later date) and seems to almost magically create an air of humanity and geniality.  No room is large enough for blacks.  In any cafeteria or hall, even in the domed stadium of a flooded city, always do they look out of place  &mdash;  like me in the Christian Science Reading Room.  Maybe, they sense that they live a life which for them is inauthentic.  Perhaps, that is why their rage boils so close to the surface.</p>

		<p>Now, do you understand why George Wallace stood in front of the entrance to the University of Alabama?  Can&rsquo;t you grant him the point that he wanted to prevent this from happening at the state&rsquo;s flagship public university?  And that&rsquo;s not counting the official reason of states rights and a protest against judicial tyranny, which are good enough reasons by themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty nice looking cafeteria we&rsquo;re paying for, whose damages we&rsquo;ll pay to repair.   And by &#8220;we,&#8221; I mean all of America&rsquo;s taxpayers.  Not just Alabama&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>Another univeristy with no white student support or activist group anywhere on campus. Not a single one. All the while endless numbers of &#8216;minority&rsquo; interest groups are promoted and agitating on campus, influencing the coverage done by the student newspaper and even the curriculum. No doubt this same university practices both &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; and a habit of blaming whites and &#8216;privilege&rsquo;, and strangely enough &#8216;institutional racism&rsquo;, for all evils there and in society at large and indeed for all ill affecting every creature anywhere on planet earth. </p>

		<p>Three years ago I saw a full scale riot just like this in a school I worked in at the time.  But it was both latinos and blacks who started jumping each other and beating each other wildly.  There were at least 50 involved.  When the school safety agents arrived, the rioters started attacking them.  It was then I knew I needed a transfer!  In my life as a white man who grew up in a whitebread town, I never even contemplated people could behave in such a manner.</p>
<p>Oh well, it&rsquo;s probably all a misunderstanding.  The inorities feel oppressed and so are forced to act out.  It&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>

		<p>This looks like one of those fights in the chow hall at your local &#8220;correctional institution&#8221; that are shown on Spike TV. I guess the local version of the &#8220;crips&#8221; and the &#8220;bloods&#8221; don&rsquo;t play well together at ASU. Those late night discussions of Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche just boiled over in the dining hall. Granted, the media would have you believe that the only reason that the philosophy of these men is not studied at this fine institution of higher learning is that the white man is hiding all of the books. </p>
<p>Some years ago, 60 minutes (I believe) did a story on HBCU recruiting of white students. Alabama State came up a couple of times in the story when it came to admission standards. Whites supposedly could be admitted and gain scholarships with lower grades. I didn&rsquo;t hear a discussion of comparable SAT scores. </p>

<p>Watch video for more political correctness gone wrong.  They took productive farms from whites, gave them to blacks and the farms fail over and over.  </p>

		<p>A few questions&hellip;</p>
<p>But the best question on this article would be this&hellip;WHO was recording the video!?</p>
<p>Yet another video to help wake White-America up. I&rsquo;ve been to this town coming from Georgia and the population in the school, judging from the town itself this does not surprise me as to what happened in that cafeteria. And to think, us taxpayers are going to have to pay for the damage most likely.</p>
<p>And if this is a university&hellip;what is the school boards definition of &#8220;Gifted&#8221;? Isn&rsquo;t that what college supposed to be, a group of talented students wanting a bright future and making something of themselves? Perhaps the video will be the new poster child for this University! <br>
Or else maybe it&rsquo;s the entire school sports team on lunch during a specific hour?</p>
<p>And how much did these students, or parents, (or US!?) pay for each one to be accepted into Riot University? </p>
<p>And ONE person person arrested!? you kidding me? If a white was in there and got beat up by a number of blacks&hellip;I wonder how this story would came out?<br>

		<p>#5, Anonymous wrote that there are 340 white students enrolled there at Alabama State.  No doubt this ruckus was caused by a group of those white students.  This does not sound like black behaviour at all, no sir!  Tis a same indeed, that the black students&rsquo; meal was interrupted by such brash white behaviour at the dining facility.  The resulting video tape will confirm that blacks at college are always on the best of behaviour.</p>

		<p>How can a school that accepts an AVERAGE ACT score of 16 be taken serious?  I graduated from a small public university in WI and ate in the cafeterias nearly every day for 2 years.  The idea of something like this happening there was impossible.  There was just no way it would ever occur, past, present, or future. This activity would be unheard in every high school I&rsquo;ve personally ever been aware of.  This is supposed to be a college?  The best and brightest of our future citizens and leaders(yeah&hellip; right), and this is the type of behavior they display?  I just can&rsquo;t believe the insanity of our country that we can&rsquo;t admitt what the common denominator is in all of these &#8220;altercations&#8221;.    </p>

		<p>This is just what happens when too much of this population is in one place.</p>
<p>People need to practice what they will do in such situations. Almost all of the Right Wing conservative thinking about guns, law and order are just not applicable in such situations.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t going to have AR 15 riffles available in such situations to mow down hundreds of Black brawlers and if even one of these &#8220;youths&#8221; were killed by a White with a gun, that White person would be persecuted worse than the Duke Lacrosse team who never hurt anyone.</p>
<p>No, the key is to get training to be in and around large groups of non Whites, the worst being low class Blacks or third world Muslims and practice staying cool and effective. Most people aren&rsquo;t killed or seriously injured when Black teens start rioting, punching, kicking, but it can be terrifying. </p>
<p>Here are some tips.</p>
<p>Keep on your feet, when you go down and the mob starts to kick at your head, that&rsquo;s where the real danger is.</p>
<p>Use improvised weapons - in this case chairs would be the most effective.</p>

		<p>I think the first poster has a good idea in saying that the college should be shut down, and all of the other colleges that blacks have ruined should be shut down, too. As most of the students who start this college drop out, that&rsquo;s an enormous amount of public money wasted. The quality of life on this campus is probably very bad, too, what with disruptive classrooms, rap music thumping everywhere, and a high crime rate. It has long gotten to the point where anybody who wants to learn has a choice between online colleges or small private ones.     </p>

		<p>Since these goons are those who &#8220;graduated&#8221; high school (which typically means that in order to &#8220;earn&#8221; C-averages all they had to do was show up and breathe) and are now attending college, they&rsquo;re a cut above the average blacks.</p>
<p>And&hellip; in spite of being a cut above the average, they&rsquo;re incapable of reflecting that instead of having to compete for a shrinking supply of the menial jobs for which their skills and intellects qualify them in the second worst economic downturn in US history, college is a pretty good deal.<br>

<p>&#8220;Now, do you understand why George Wallace stood in front of the entrance to the University of Alabama? Can&rsquo;t you grant him the point that he wanted to prevent this from happening at the state&rsquo;s flagship public university? &#8220;</p>
<p>Outstanding point that MUST BE MADE.  Like South Africa, white management was preventing chaos, but outsiders had to meddle and destroy it as a matter of principle, creating a far worse situation than previously existed.  And of course, it also has cost everyone their world.  Only a constant barrage of media propaganda props up the notion that we are living in a more just, safer, and progressive world.</p>

		<p>What gets me is looking at how new the furnishings are in the student center.  I bet it doesn&rsquo;t hold up like that for very long.  I&rsquo;d further wager they have to replace most of it every 3 to 5 years if not more often.<br>

		<p>Some of the Historically Black Colleges/Universities have very quiet special relationships with dental and medical schools.  If you graduate with a degree in Biology, etc., you are automatically admitted to the &#8220;partner&#8221; dental or medical school.  Whites are NEVER told by the medical/dental schools that these special programs exist, but blacks are.  The medical/dental school gets a steady stream of diversity, while keeping overall standards high by taking only the cream of the cream of the whites and Asians.  </p>
<p>My guess is that most of the whites attending this school in Alabama either live right in the neighborhood and can&rsquo;t afford to go elsewhere OR they are hoping to go to graduate school, and know that they need to be on a &#8220;special track&#8221; like the one described in the previous paragraph OR they just want to be able to work fulltime AND maintain a 4.0 average.</p>
<p>Lots of white and Asian kids planning to go to medical school go to junior college for two years and get past all of the hard science classes there while maintaining a high grade point average.  Then after one year at a four year school taking &#8220;easy&#8221; classes and maintaining a high grade point average, they apply for graduate school.  </p>
<p>Smart white kids who start off at a competitive college in a pre-med program often shoot themselves in the foot.  The program is too competitive, and their grades suffer so much that they will never be seriously considered for an opening at the graduate school level.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;&#8221;And went to the front page and look what I found, my &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; guy, Tim &ldquo;Wise.</i></p>
<p>Does Tim Wise spend a lot of time walking in the ghetto? Something tells me doesn&rsquo;t because of crime fears. He&rsquo;s not for real. He stokes angry black fires and then retreats to his comfy gated-community condo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ordinary privilege-less white guy who suffers the consequences of Tim&rsquo;s whipping up of black mobs to go on the attack.</p>
<p>I wonder how many future rocket scientists and brain surgeons were involved in the cafeteria riot? I&rsquo;m guessing not many. More like aspiring hip-hop rappers and future Cornell Wests.</p>

		<p>a student with an ACT score of 16 has an IQ below 100, and should be learning a trade, not attending college.</p>
<p>a university where 50% of the students have IQs is the 80s and 90s is by definition a criminal conspiracy.</p>

One arrest. ONE. </p>
<p>What incentive does that give anybody who participated in this, not to pull the same stupid stunt again tomorrow or the next day or next week? The lesson being taught here is: go ahead, fight in public, smash and destroy school property, there won&rsquo;t be any consequences. </p>
<p>It appears these folks have some sort of Riot Instinct, or Chaos Gene. When gathered in large numbers, this kind of &#8220;pandemonium&#8221; (as the video&rsquo;s future valedictorian correctly calls it) seems never to be too far under the surface. Capable of erupting very suddenly, and on very slight provocation. Do any of the rioters even KNOW what it is they&rsquo;re rioting over? It&rsquo;s not even as if this were some sort of protest march that got out of hand. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also note that ASU&rsquo;s lunch room looks a lot nicer and more expensive than the one at the middle-tier college I attended in the &rsquo;80s. Or rather, I should say ASU&rsquo;s is nicer at the START of the video. By the end? Not so much&hellip; </p>

		<p>Where are all the white children of the liberal black apologists?  Why aren&rsquo;t all the self-loathing whites sending their own precious pride-n-joy&rsquo;s here to learn about the superiority of everything non-white and more specifically *black*?  So puzzling&hellip;</p>
