			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Britten, Telegraph (London), February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The bodies of Joy Small, 24, and the children were found in their flat the day after Aram Aziz, 32, was found dead at a beauty spot.</p>
<p>Friends of Miss Small yesterday described Mr Aziz as an &#8220;abusive monster&#8221; who had threatened to kill her previously and had once even poured petrol over her.</p>
<p>Police said the family were known to them and it is understood Miss Small, who had converted to Islam and was an active internet campaigner on the rights of Muslims, had installed a panic button at her flat.</p>
<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission said they had been in contact with Leicestershire police over the case but, based on the evidence known so far, no formal referral was required.</p>
<p>The body of Mr Aziz, who is believed to come from Iraq, was found by a park warden in woodland at Watermead Country Park, Leicester, on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The following day, officers visited his flat three miles away in Birstall, and found the bodies of Miss Small, their son, Aubarr, three, and daughter, Chanara, two.</p>
<p>Friends said the couple had split up last year, but had got back together again despite a history of violence by Mr Aziz.</p>
<p>Jennie Bland, 27, a close friend, said: &#8220;She was a good person, and a fantastic mum. Her husband was extremely possessive. He would beat her all the time, and tried to stop her seeing her friends. He&rsquo;d poured petrol over her, tried to set her alight, and thrown a mirror at their son. He was an abusive monster.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&rsquo;t like me because I knew what he was like. She could be herself around me. I met her in May 2008, when they&rsquo;d already been together for a few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she eventually found the strength to finish with him last summer. She was doing really well, with the support of her friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&rsquo;d had to have a panic button installed in her flat. I stayed over one night and Joy had a hammer under her pillow; she was that scared of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they split up, he&rsquo;d left a message on her answer phone saying he would kill her and the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said she could never have another boyfriend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went away last July, and when I got back she was quiet. She said she had a new boyfriend, but I had my suspicions she was back with him. In November, I found out she was, and we fell out. I couldn&rsquo;t stand by and let it happen. She had been warned by police and social services that if she got back with him, they&rsquo;d take her kids off her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want that to happen but I wish I&rsquo;d followed my instincts now and said something. If I had, she might still be alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Post mortem examinations are expected to be carried out during the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Miss Small, who has a brother and sister, as well as four half-sisters and a half-brother, was born in Sheffield and lived in Grimsby before settling in Leicester.</p>
<p>She had an older son by her first marriage, to Javed Ghaznavi, 32.</p>
<p>Miss Small&rsquo;s stepfather, Martin Small, who lives with her mother, Susan, in Northern Ireland, said: &#8220;We haven&rsquo;t seen very much of Joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;She started living in a very Muslim area of Leicester and began living a Muslim life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The good news is that this dingbat is no longer campaigning for the &#8220;rights&#8221; of Muslims; would that someone could campaign for the right of the rest of us to not have them in our countries!</p>

		<p>This might sound heartless but I do not care one jot for this woman.<br>
&#8220;Friends of Miss Small yesterday described Mr Aziz as an &ldquo;abusive monster&rdquo; who had threatened to kill her previously and had once even poured petrol over her&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew waht he was like and went back. She was warned that her children would be taken away yet she still went back.</p>
<p>All the time campaigning for Muslim rights.</p>
<p>she had plenty of hard lessons and did not learn from them.</p>

		<p>One would be tempted to say that what happened to this poor woman is similar to that of white woman who engage with blacks - and there may be some similarities - but the real problem here is islam.  That is a culture, or ideology, which at its heart holds women to be fundamentally inferior beings, subject to whatever males mete out. If you add racial hatred to the mix, it becomes deadly for the female. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering if she might have been the victim of leftist brainwashing, since the UK probably has more left wing elitist fools pushing diversity per capita than any other Western country.  If whe was she should be pitied, if she wasn&rsquo;t she more than paid the price for her stupidity.</p>

		<p>In Program we know that no drunk can get sober unless it&rsquo;s his/her own desire to get sober; that is, no one can do it for someone else, or because the law forces you to, or anything else.  Likewise, this young white woman was addicted to being stupid.  If she was so stupid that she was willing to put not just herself but her children in harm&rsquo;s way, then all the friends in the world could not have helped her.  It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the children could not have been saved.  But she, because of her unwillingness to change, wrote her own death warrant - and in this case, her children&rsquo;s as well.  I&rsquo;ve seen many an alky die for exactly the same reason - they weren&rsquo;t willing to change, and chose the humiliations of the world instead of the humility that results from practicing the Program.  It&rsquo;s sad, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.  People&rsquo;s choices determine their position in life - that&rsquo;s immutable Law.</p>

<p>And her life ended in a very moslem way.  Something must have been terribly wrong with this woman to seek out moslem men to marry knowing how they treat their wives.  It&rsquo;s terrible what happened to the children, but it&rsquo;s hard to have sympathy for her.  </p>

		<p>Everyone is being very hard on this woman, but I want to consider another angle; Joy Small as a victim of the Labor Party&rsquo;s long running propaganda campaigns, BBC liberal campaigns, etc.  When Brits, or any white anywhere is raised on propaganda aimed at brainwashing them into this sort of &#8220;alcoholic style,&#8221; addictive behavior, it might be wise to look at the culture that is creating her type of victim.  If there were no or very few Muslims in Britain, she would have chosen another partner, likely English.  If society took the protection of women seriously, as it used before the age of arrogant Feminist individualism, she would not have been a victim.  And if the British culture had been better preserved in Britain, dozens of decent Englishmen would have sought out an abuser of a lady and beat him senseless.  The entire white population of Britain seems to have become neutered, passive, proles, only interested in momentary sensation and their next feeding time.</p>

		<p>So much for the &#8220;religion of peace&#8221;.  A number of times, I have been proselytized by muslims.  They were shocked when I quoted from the koran the deceptive permissions, the outright condonng of abusive behavior and other passages that all muslims hope would never be revealed to &#8220;infidels&#8221;.  I had to correct my muslim proselytizers by stating that the word &#8220;islam&#8221; means &#8220;submission&#8221; and NOT &#8220;peace&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I think that this poor woman is as much a victim of the current climate of Muslim pandering so common in the UK now. I have seen this first hand having been married to a Muslim in my younger and stupider days. A likely scenario for convert women who are brainwashed into believing that they have to marry Muslim men- after the first one beats and abuses her she thinks that they next one will be better. By the time she is 40- assuming that she has not become an unfortunate murder victim- she will be considered washed up, used and passed around, likely with several kids by different men. Girls need to realize that these men do not have their best interests at heart, they will use them for sex and when they are ready for their official Muslim wife they will dump the white girl like a used snot rag. I saw this coming a mile away and ran back to my own culture. </p>

		<p>Reminds me of that story on Amren a while back of the man who got mugged by blacks five times in a row in London, and still couldn&rsquo;t make the connection, proudly proclaiming his &#8216;anti-racism.&rsquo;  The last attack landed him in the hospital, as he got hit on the head with a steel pipe.</p>
<p>Apparently he wasn&rsquo;t hit hard enough.</p>

		<p>These stories we read all the time from England are so sickening.  Occupying Japan after WW II was in hindsight a waste of resources.  We (the US) should&rsquo;ve occupied Britain for a time until they regained their senses after that horrible ordeal.  In a helpful way of course.  The ultra leftists seem to have taken hold of &amp; raped that nation, our motherland.  I really doubt that in 1946 the leaders of the allies would&rsquo;ve predicted how things have ended up 60 + years later for the British Isles.  The heritage of eons has been sacrificed to the god of marx in such a short time.</p>
<p>The US has had onslaughts of the super PC rapeage but being a vast nation I don&rsquo;t think it can stick here at such a hideous scale.  More room to breathe here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s EXACTLY the same! That&rsquo;s why Blacks embrace Islam. It gives them carte blanche to pursue their hideous behavior which often involves unspeakable atrocities against women and all with the sanction of God. In addition they get to &#8220;dress up&#8221;. <br>
The Raheems, Shamirs, Shaheeds and Abduls never stop to think that Muslims were their original slave masters. <br>

<p>&#8220;Panic button?&#8221; I guess this was for when the beatings really got out of hand. The &ldquo;religion of peace&rdquo; once again demonstrates it&rsquo;s warm and caring nature towards women. Like someone mentioned above, at least she will not be campaigning for the rights of these muslim barbarians any longer. </p>
