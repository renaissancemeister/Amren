			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kent Chapline &amp; Bud Gillett, CBSDFW.com, February 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s Dallas County Commissioner&rsquo;s Court meeting erupted into an argument between Commissioner John Wiley Price and a citizen, ending with Price repeatedly telling several citizens to &#8220;go to hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Six citizens addressed the court. All of them talked about the recent controversial departure of county Elections Administrator Bruce Sherbet. Sherbet, who was the Elections Administrator for 24 years, said he felt Price and Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins forced him out.</p>
<p>The last public speaker at Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, Jeff Turner, began by stating that he would refer to &#8220;a certain member of the court&#8221;  &mdash;  Price  &mdash;  as &#8220;the Chief Mulllah of Dallas County.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Turner spoke, he continued to call Price &#8220;Chief Mulllah.&#8221; Price interrupted Turner several times, yelling at him, &#8220;don&rsquo;t call me Chief Mulllah&#8221; and &#8220;call me by my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}Turner continued speaking, ignoring Price&rsquo;s ongoing interruptions.</p>
<p>At that point, Jenkins adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>As Price stood to leave, he looked at Turner and the five other citizens who addressed the court. Price said to them, &#8220;All of you are white. Go to hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Price repeated &#8220;go to hell&#8221; three more times. An unknown member of the audience said, &#8220;You should be ashamed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not ashamed!&#8221; Price answered. &#8220;I&rsquo;m not ashamed! Go to hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenkins, Price and the other commissioners then left the courtroom to hold individual private meetings with constituents and others, which they traditionally do following the meeting of the entire court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Turner left the commissioner&rsquo;s court immediately following the meeting.</p>
<p>At 3:00pm Commissioner Price spoke with 1080 KRLD to explain why he chose to use the words he did.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, Price released a written statement about the episode in commissioners court. It contains offensive language. Here is Price&rsquo;s statement, published in its entirety exactly as he sent it to us: <blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>I have been patient and accommodating in every regard as it pertains to the recent resignation of a Dallas County employee. {snip}</p>
<p>However, in open court today, after every considerate attempt to discuss the matter further, one of the speakers shot off a racial slur. &#8220;Chief Moolah&#8221; has its roots in a slang that was used against Italian immigrants and was later used by the same to defame or discredit African Americans. The speaker continued to use terms like &#8220;tribal&#8221; and his intent to make race an issue was obvious. &#8220;Nigger&#8221; is &#8220;Nigger,&#8221; spoken overtly or incognito.</p>
<p>My history and record will reflect that I am one whose tolerance is limited or non-existent when it comes to racial slurs. The comments were bad enough, but to have them hurled by a member of the Tea Party, known for their racial insensitivity, was more than I plan to absorb.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote>CBS 11 caught up with Price Tuesday night at an event featuring filmmaker Spike Lee. Price continued to say he was frustrated on how the media was covering his statement, but said his statement was not an apology.</p>

		<p>Comrade Commissioner John Price has been blatantly racist for decades.  I can remember his &#8220;warrior marches,&#8221; where ghetto residents were paid to join alongside to protest any number of ghetto related legislation, and showing up in his Mercedes to do so.</p>
<p>The fact that he is still in public office shows how racist blacks in South Dallas are.  They condone this type of behavior.</p>
<p>And the &#8220;Chief Mullah&#8221; comment.  Price chalks it up to a racist statement, I chalk it up to financial slang.  The speaker should have called him &#8220;Daddy War Bucks.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>Wow.  That chip on the shoulder certainly causes some selective hearing.  First it was &#8220;black ho&rsquo;s&#8221; on greeting cards and now this.</p>
<p>Of course maybe I give too much credit in assuming Price would even have an awareness of the what &#8220;Mullah&#8221; means.</p>

		<p>This is a fine example of the low IQ response.  Price simply cannot respond civilly or logically.  When one feels cornered or attacked, nature (IQ) takes over.  In Price&rsquo;s case, an emotional outburst is one of only two responses available to him.  The other being a physical attack.  With a less populated forum, this could have had a bloody ending.<br>

<p>You have got to love the mixture of ignorance, hypersensitivity, and admitted intolerance.  Not knowing that &#8220;Mullah&#8221; refers to the Muslim world is classic.  He also managed to slander the Tea Party.  What a sorry excuse for an official.</p>

		<p>Commissioner Price first came to national/Amren fame for loudly insisting &#8220;black hole&#8221; was a racist term.  He never apologized for that, either.  </p>
<p>From 2008 (two links):<br>
<i>Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price is sticking to his comments that the term &ldquo;black hole,&rdquo; which a colleague used, is racist. Price also says language such as &ldquo;angel food cake&rdquo; and &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s food cake&rdquo; are also racially insensitive.</i></p>
<p><a href="/news/2008/07/commissioner_de.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/07/commissioner_de.php</a></p>
<p><i>Commissioner Kenneth Mayfield, who is white, said it seemed that central collections &ldquo;has become a black hole&rdquo; because paperwork reportedly has become lost in the office.</i></p>
<p><i>Commissioner John Wiley Price, who is black, interrupted him with a loud &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; He then corrected his colleague, saying the office has become a &ldquo;white hole.&rdquo;</i></p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see the foolish mistake this Price made. The Italian slang word &#8220;Moolie&#8221; a derogatory word for blacks, has its roots in the word &#8220;melanzana,&#8221; which meant eggplant. He heard &#8220;mullah&#8221; and thought he was being called a &#8220;moolie,&#8221; apparently. Of course, this misheard word alibi that would explain why he told all the white people to &#8220;go to hell,&#8221; might very well be something he came up with on the spot, when he was composing the letter and thinking about damage control. If past is prologue, he should know that as a black politician one does not need to fret about damage control. He can say anything he wants about whites without reprisal. If, however, he suspects even a hint of white racism, he can bludgeon the offending white party in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s shouting to the world that he doesn&rsquo;t like whites.</p>
<p>Neither reporter dared ask him about that comment, although it was a blatantly racist one.  </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m positive if a white commissioner had said the same thing to blacks they would have no reluctance to question the statement and the incident and the language would have made the front page in the local paper.</p>

		<p>If a white county commissioner had said to a handful of black citizens, &#8220;all of you are black&hellip; go to hell&#8221;, that commissioner would no longer have his job.  I&rsquo;d like to know why THIS commissioner still does.  If THAT isn&rsquo;t racist against whites I don&rsquo;t know what is.  But then again, it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable to be racist if it&rsquo;s against whites, isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

		<p> Jeff Turner in his audio comments sounded much more intelligent, and made a lot more sense, than did Price in his. The commissioner sounded arrogant and full of himself   &mdash;   typical of many black officeholders nowadays.</p>
<p> And, of course, if Price had been White, and had told five persons in the audience who had differed with him,&#8221;All of you are black   &mdash;   go to hell!&#8221;, it would be a national scandal, with extensive press coverage, Jesse and Al marching and protesting, cries of &#8220;Racism!&#8221;, ad nauseum. Don&rsquo;t expect this one to go any farther than the Dalas County limits   &mdash;   and to American Renaissance. </p>

		<p>I first heard of this guy back when he made a stink about some other council member using the term &#8216;black hole&rsquo;. I have come to the conclusion that Blacks with corn rows pretty much have one thing in common: Black man with &#8220;attitude&#8221;.</p>
<p>BTW, if I was there at that older incident, I would have asked him to define just exactly what a &#8220;white hole&#8221; is, and how it related to the subject at hand. Would have been interesting to hear his nonsensical response.</p>

		<p>Right on #10, Bro Dixie Rider. Mr. Price, an affirmative action hire public official, isn&rsquo;t really a whole lot different from the hooligans tearing up I-Hops and Wendys all over our once-great land. Catch on camera black antisocial behavior, black ignorance, and black hypersensitivity based on ignorance, then let the actions speak for themselves.</p>
<p>It took me 50+ years to figure out something I&rsquo;ve been observing for just as long with my own eyes and ears: MOST blacks  &mdash;  not just a few  &mdash;  regardless of their station in life, the level of their responsibilities, or any facade of respectability, are impulsive boors who unapologetically hate white people.</p>

		<p>Price is a low IQ Black idiot, but his confused rant has some basis in history.</p>
<p>Price is referring to the term &#8220;moolie&#8221; short for &#8220;moulinya&#8221;, used by Italians, Italian Americans to insult Blacks. It translates from the Italian for Eggplant, but is generally come down to be the Italian equivalent for &#8220;The N word&#8221;.</p>
<p>So Price thinks he&rsquo;s being insulted with the Italian version of the N word, instead he is being called a &#8220;Mullah&#8221; which is generally used to refer to a Muslim man, educated in Islamic theology and sacred law.  So the folks insulting Price are basically referring to him as some foreign Arab, Afro Arab Muslim guy acting as some bossy religious judge.</p>

		<p>I would say that Price is dumb as a post, but that would insult upstanding fence posts everywhere. How incredibly stupid can a man be? I wonder who ties his shoe laces for him in the mornings? He is simply constantly looking for an opportunity to take offense. With a chip that size on his shoulder, I&rsquo;ll bet he finds someone to knock it off just about every day.</p>

		<p>I think everyone is overintellectualizing this.  More probably, Commissioner Price thinks he was being called &#8216;Moolah&rsquo; as in &#8216;The Fabulous Moolah&rsquo; (the veritable Matriarch of Lady Professional Wrestlers).</p>
<p>Somehow, I suspect etymology, particularly back to the Italian Vernacular, is a bit beyond Commissioner Price&rsquo;s horizons.</p>
<p>Then again, Price could have thought he was being called &#8216;The Girl-name for Moo-cow&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Hey General quagmire:  How true!  Unfortunately I have to go to college with them at the moment.  No condiseration for the right or feelings of others, no realization that college is hard work; nor taking responsibility for their own actions.  The only good thing about this country going bankrupt is that we probably won&rsquo;t have the money to throw at this mostly worthless and hate-filled race anymore.</p>

		<p>Hirsch is right.  I can still remember the word &#8220;moolie&#8221; being screamed as watermelons were being thrown as the residents of Bensonhurst (Brooklyn) responded to Al Sharpton&rsquo;s march through their neighborhood (in response to a racial incident back in the 90&rsquo;s or so).</p>
<p>See &#8220;moolie&#8221; here:</p>

		<p>@9 Q,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;All of you are white. Go to hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s shouting to the world that he doesn&rsquo;t like whites.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No he&rsquo;s not.  He&rsquo;s shouting to the world that he hates being black.  That he is just smart enough to &#8216;know there is a conversation going on in the subtexts&rsquo; which he is _not smart enough to get_.</p>
<p>And because he thinks it is so unfair that he doesn&rsquo;t get it, that his operating vocabulary as conceptual intellect is so small that he -can&rsquo;t- get it, despite his elevated position, he automatically assumes it&rsquo;s a conspiracy against him personally.</p>
<p>And the one thing he does &#8216;get&rsquo; as a functional identity point for his persecution complex to form around, is one that he subconsciously recognizes in himself because he sees it in many of those around him who share the same trait as skin color: stupidity.</p>
<p>It is unfair Mr. Price.  Because a white man in your position would never be called a &#8216;Mullah&rsquo; as a religious insult and mistake it as a racial one.  There are whites who are that stupid.  But we would not elect one to high office because whites compete amongst each other, &#8216;fairly&rsquo;, to a common standard of intellectual performance.</p>
<p>It is not a conspiracy however.  Because genetics were never made to yield &#8216;equality&rsquo; in nature as an evolutionary edge.  And we refuse to act in our own best interests to make our -advantage- over you even more distinct.</p>
<p>Which is a shame.  Because the world is getting smarter all around us and we need every evolutionary edge we can get: natural or engineered.</p>
<p>We do not need to elevate blacks to positions they advertise their lack of qualification in holding.</p>

Tomorrow night, Investigation Discovery cable channel premieres &#8220;The Injustice Files&#8221;.  A documentary filmmaker investigates civil rights era cold cases where the truth was covered up.  He even has the civil rights division of the FBI in his back pocket.  Think he&rsquo;ll investigate the racist black Zebra killings?  Much more widespread than officially acknowledged, just a handful of racist killers convicted.  The killer or killers of a NYC policeman still free.  It was a set-up ambush.  Was the troof covered up?<br>

		<p>25:  You just answered a question I&rsquo;ve had ever since I heard the FBI was starting a civil rights cold case unit.  My question was this   &mdash;   Why are they bothering investigating crimes that happened before the enactment of Federal civil rights laws?  Ex post facto and all that.  You just provided me with the answer   &mdash;   They can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t bring charges, but they&rsquo;re going to &#8220;leak out&#8221; parts of their &#8220;investigations&#8221; that are part truths, part half-truths, part out-of-context truths, part invective and part lies, so that documentary producers and &#8220;academics&#8221; can then &#8220;draw their own conclusions,&#8221; i.e. slander white people.  This will enrage blacks even more, who will in turn murder whites out of a sense of &#8220;revenge.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sorry again, but my post doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the story.  Just wanted to write that the Investigation Discovery channel is doing the Christian/Newsom racist murders.</p>

		<p>This guy is proof positive that there are no Whites in Dallas with any back-bone.  This black PUNK has been around for 30 years acting like the hoodlum he is, and not ONE White Dallas official has the gumption to reign this A-Hole in.  Well, Dallas gets what it deserves.</p>

		<p>If a white county commissioner had said to a handful of black citizens, &ldquo;all of you are black&hellip; go to hell&rdquo;, that commissioner would no longer have his job. I&rsquo;d like to know why THIS commissioner still does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called black skin privilege.</p>

		<p>An experiment should be run, with a white county commissioner saying &#8220;all of you are black&hellip;go to hell&#8221;.  Let&rsquo;s see the reaction.  </p>
