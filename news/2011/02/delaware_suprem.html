<h1>Delaware Supreme Court Overturns Cinema Ruling</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean O&rsquo;Sullivan, News Journal (New Castle County, Michigan), February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Delaware Supreme Court overturned a decision by the state Human Relations Commission that the manager of a Dover cinema was racist when he used a &#8220;condescending tone&#8221; in telling a crowd of largely black patrons viewing a Tyler Perry movie to silence their cell phones and remain quiet.</p>
<p>The commission also ordered the Carmike 14 Theater to pay nearly $80,000 for violating the Delaware Equal Accommodations Law after it determined the October 2007 announcement  &mdash;  which was not regularly made in that way in other theaters  &mdash;  &#8220;insulted, humiliated and demeaned&#8221; patrons in that manager David Stewart had singled out a black audience at a &#8220;minority-themed&#8221; movie.</p>
<p>Court papers note that extra security also was brought in that night and guards were double-checking ticket stubs as audience members entered, which the plaintiffs said further added to the humiliation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The warning about cell phones was shown on the screen and then was delivered in person in the largest of the three auditoriums by Stewart, according to court papers. Some patrons later said Stewart&rsquo;s tone &#8220;was offensive and condescending, as if he were speaking to children.&#8221; And because the crowd, which had been well-behaved to that point, was &#8220;90 to 95 percent&#8221; black, some felt it was racist because it implied that blacks did not know how to behave in a movie theater.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m gratified by the ruling because blacks, like whites, actually have to abide by standards of politeness in a movie theater   &mdash;   and have no right to intimidate whites in the audience who object to their noise.  Still, this raises an issue:  Why would any white person see a Tyler Perry movie?  How about &#8220;The Fighter,&#8221; &#8220;Tron Legacy&#8221; or &#8220;True Grit?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>They DON&rsquo;T know how to behave in public!  They have no personal dignity or respect for others.  The theater manager was protecting his interests and the rights of other patrons.  I don&rsquo;t see how this could be wrong, but I guess it&rsquo;s just something else to blame the white race for.  They were treated like children because they were acting like children&hellip;typical of their mentality.  I have stopped patronizing many businesses because they are overrun by shucking and jiving black people.  Maybe if they acted like responsible human beings, we would treat them as such. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up.  </p>
<p>What do you think this same case will look like in the future when all the diversity hires are sitting on the court?  They are taught to overturn the White laws, not enforce them. </p>
<p>Being black is the greatest privilege on this planet, and to profit from us, blacks must force Whites into total submission and dispossession.  Black law students today all understand that, so don&rsquo;t look for &#8220;justice&#8221; as define it as a White to ever be upheld by the diversity justices when they have all the power, which will happen in your lifetime and set the culture for the last miserable decades that they allow you to have life, but only as long as it serves them and their selves.</p>
<p><br>
The greatest crime against blacks was forcing them to accept our White language. If we will only encourage them to free themselves from our linguistic system, may they will calm down and feel less oppressed.  Every time they think, speak, or write in English, it feels like the slave lash cutting another wound into their black flesh.  No wonder they are so angry.  Free them!  Ebonics is a first and hopeful step.  Next, teach them all Congolese and Edo, and then  charge them a race tax every time they use our White language without first asking our permission for the privilege.</p>

<p>Ha, Ha!  Have you ever been in a movie theater with Blacks?  Blacks even joke among themselves that all they do is whoop, laugh, scream, and comment during movies. Movies with black audiences are not really movies, they are public discussion/rap/stand-up comedy sessions.  With Blacks, movie-going &#8220;takes a village!&#8221;  This is known by everyone.  But of course, in Black-Run-America, it would be racist to 1) notice it and 2) Ask Blacks to tone it down during the movie.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had the misfortune of being in a cinema where the audience was majority black on two occasions. Never again. I walked out both times after about 10 minutes. You simply could not hear the dialouge on the screen for all the yelling comments, laughing, etc. A fair number of which were racist or vulgar.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;as if he were speaking to children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I take offense. My children are a million times better behaved than any black. How dare you use the word children.</p>
<p>&#8220;And because the crowd, which had been well-behaved to that point,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull, the warning was required because they were doing the exact opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;it implied that blacks did not know how to behave in a movie theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep, truth hurts.</p>

		<p>I remember back when I attended my mixed-race high school (long since turned all-black) that the school would occasionally hold fund-raisers in the form of a movie, such as the 3-D version of &#8220;The Creature from the Black Lagoon&#8221; or other such light fare, shown in the gymnasium or a large room. In some cases, the din from the black students was so great it was virtually impossible to hear the dialog. I remember that at a couple points, staff even stopped the movie and a black female teacher said to the group, &#8220;You know, there&rsquo;s actually a storyline associated with this movie.&#8221; The din lessened only slightly. Apparently, before school, after school, lunchtime and between classes wasn&rsquo;t enough time for all the babble, so the black students had to take advantage of movies too.</p>

<p>Good thing this was reversed.  Otherwise, it would have bankrupted me.</p>
<p>And where would this manager get the silly idea that an audience comprised of 90-95% blacks would be childish, would be so inconsiderate as not to turn their cell phones off, might need extra security because of rambunctiousness, and might try to sneak into the screening room?</p>

		<p>There are cell phone jamming devices that can used to shut down all the phones in a theater. Supposedly they are not legal, but I have considered buying one to use when annoyed by loud cell phone use, beeping, or texting.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I went to a play at our college. It was one of the darker Tennessee Williams affairs (there were no racial overtones in it). A black in the audience kept yelling at the actors on stage. The play was finally stopped and campus police escorted him out to the applause of the audience. </p>

		<p>To poster #9, you are so right in describing it as an unending babble.  I was once responsible for a large group of black teenagers, and they did not close their traps for four hours straight!  We were in a museum and they could not stop talking and making an absolute ruckus.  (They had no interest in what was in the museum other than to laugh and make fun of the exhibits.)  </p>
<p>There was one point when I was so exasperated that I just stood there and watched them.  They were all talking at the same time and no one was listening to anyone else.  I have never seen anything like it before.  All mouths in motion means no one can listen and respond, or so I thought.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t like they were talking about anything of any significance.  They would just say any useless thing.  Now I&rsquo;m working with latino teenagers, and about half of them are that way, but at least the other half are a bit better.</p>

		<p>I remember conducting my own experiment many years ago. </p>
<p>Phase 1 of my experiment: <br>
I watched &#8220;Phantom of the opera&#8221; in a $1 dollar ticket theater. About 90 whites in there, one hispanic. After movie was done, I stood up last, looked at the floors, perfectly clean, everyone taking their trash to the designated bin, and not a single worry or cellphone/pager going off in the dark.</p>
<p>Then came phase two in my experiment: <br>
The Nutty Professor 2. Me and my friend were the sole white men out of roughly 220 we counted, some white women were there, but not with who you&rsquo;d hope. It was the loudest, messiest movie showing I&rsquo;ve ever attended! Cell phones not dimmed, some not on vibrate going off during the film. We sat until everyone left, observed the floor and graded the experience. Let&rsquo;s just say it was the opposite of phase 1 by nearly every aspect. </p>

Warren:</p>
<p>I could not agree with you more. I was attending a movie last fall with some friends and the audience was mostly teenagers. Oh my God! Similar to your experience, they were loud, obnoxious, laughing hysterically (and in some cases, laughing at situations in the moive that were inaapropriate to laugh at), spilling drinks etc&hellip; We thought that we were going to lose our minds.</p>
<p>We managed to get through the movie, but vowed that we would never attend another movie where that many teenagers were in attendance.</p>

		<p>If anyone has had the misfortune of having to sit with a majority black audience in a movie theater they know how loud, unruly and ignorant they behave. As bad as teenagers, regardless of their age. They don&rsquo;t know how to behave in public. And they don&rsquo;t care. Which is why I haven&rsquo;t been in a movie theater in twenty years. I&rsquo;d rather wait and watch in the quiet of my home. And that goes for anywhere there&rsquo;s a lot of blacks. Maybe some may know how to behave like adults, but most do not or choose not to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the ghetto lottery bid was overturned.</p>

		<p>This is an example of why racial segregation existed in the first place.<br>
Whites are staying away from movie theaters more and more. Not only is it impossible to watch features due to black misbehavior, but the danger of crime mounts as black customers increase.   Owners will either have to do something to discourage black attendance, or entire chains will go out of business.</p>

		<p>I remember a news story from a few years back, a group of black students were taken on a field trip to see &#8220;Schindler&rsquo;s List.&#8221;  I cannot imagine the idiot who actually thought that blacks would appreciate that movie, sit through it respectfully, or feel any empathy for the victims depicted therein.  But anyway, they went.  Of course the black students talked and laughed and whooped it up.  One elderly woman in the theater was a holocaust survivor, and she complained.  The usual hand-wringing ensued, the poor, misunderstood blacks claiming to be victims of racism, etc.  Steven Spielberg even went to visit the blacks&rsquo; school and gave a talk, apparently thinking that they could be reasoned with or that they just needed a little understanding.  We whites just don&rsquo;t learn!  After all these decades of blacks behaving a certain way, whites still don&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>What really infuriates me is that going to the movies is now Number 5,673,874 of the Things Whites Can&rsquo;t Do And Enjoy Anymore Because of Blacks.  It NEVER occurs to the blacks that, &#8220;Gee, we love to whoop it up in the movies, but maybe that&rsquo;s not fair to others.&#8221;  Blacks never, EVER think of anyone but themselves, and they never will&hellip;especially if we keep on coddling them.</p>

I remember a news story from a few years back, a group of black students were taken on a field trip to see &ldquo;Schindler&rsquo;s List.&rdquo; I cannot imagine the idiot who actually thought that blacks would appreciate that movie, sit through it respectfully, or feel any empathy for the victims depicted therein. But anyway, they went. Of course the black students talked and laughed and whooped it up. One elderly woman in the theater was a holocaust survivor, and she complained. The usual hand-wringing ensued, the poor, misunderstood blacks claiming to be victims of racism, etc. Steven Spielberg even went to visit the blacks&rsquo; school and gave a talk, apparently thinking that they could be reasoned with or that they just needed a little understanding. We whites just don&rsquo;t learn! After all these decades of blacks behaving a certain way, whites still don&rsquo;t learn.</p>
<p>They probably weren&rsquo;t any worse than White teenagers. Warren and Sandra, I agree with you.</p>

		<p>Insulting or not, what does it matter? Halting their bahavior  doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve commented to a group of loud black men at the gym, &#8216;Would ya&rsquo;ll pleeeease not be so loud? You&rsquo;re making me crazy.&rsquo; It only helped for that day. I think they were embarassed around everyone else that a younger white lady actually said something to their group. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also made obvious stares at hearing loud young white men talk degradingly about going after girls. They&rsquo;re still at it.</p>
<p>But, the above situation wasn&rsquo;t racist. They just happened to be black, just like the loud ones in movie theaters usually happen to be. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m old enough to have had the unique moviegoing experience of seeing double- (or triple-) bills at the notorious Times Square grindhouses of pre-Giuliani New York City. The mostly-black audiences at these discount flea-pits were unbelievably loud and unruly; but fortunately for me the worst that I personally suffered was that the soles of my shoes kept sticking to the floor. </p>
<p>So I never witnessed anything quite as bad as what the white science-fiction author Harlan Ellison experienced at one such cinema in the early 1970s. There, during a showing of the talky, Oscar-winning Jack Lemmon drama <i>Save the Tiger</i> (what on EARTH was that film doing playing on 42nd St?) one ghetto type got into an argument with another ghetto type, and actually THREW HIM OFF THE BALCONY, to his death   &mdash;   right in front of Ellison&rsquo;s eyes   &mdash;   for refusing to shut up during the movie. (Language warning; NSFW): </p>
<p><a href="http://harlanellison.com/iwrite/mostimp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://harlanellison.com/iwrite/mostimp.htm</a></p>
<p>The pertinent portion about &#8220;Leeee-ROY&#8221; is found in &#8220;Section 2: Violence.&#8221; </p>
<p>I bring this up because we should all remember that minority misbehavior in moviehouses can be a lot worse than merely annoying or distracting   &mdash;   it can also be LETHAL. </p>

		<p><i>&#8220;The commission also ordered the Carmike 14 Theater to pay nearly $80,000 for violating the Delaware Equal Accommodations Law after it determined the October 2007 announcement&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Does this mean the movie theater has to pay up?  If so it is outrageous in the extreme. Whenever I hear dusky yoofs talking in the cinema I am sitting in I have to do an algebraic equation as to whether or not it is pertinent to tell the manager, or to just ignore it. Having a weapon of some sort in your pocket is highly recommended if you tell dusky patrons to shush. If they attack at least you&rsquo;ll be able to inflict some damage on them as well.</p>
<p>FYI: Any white patrons to a Tyler Perry film get what they deserve.</p>

I&rsquo;m one of the few intellectually honest blacks that I&rsquo;ve ever known. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that I have nothing in common w/ my &#8220;fellow&#8221; blacks. I think it&rsquo;s time for me to subscribe w/ Amren, if that is Ok with the community. Oh, and blacks ARE noisy as hell when in groups 3 or larger.</p>

		<p>I live at the edge of (but not &#8216;in&rsquo;) Jackson, Mississippi.  That city does not have one single Movie Theater.  I don&rsquo;t need to tell you why that is.  This is a situation which has persisted for decades, despite incessant plans (involving Government money, one way or another) and pipe dreams to build one.  One hears the most absurd schemes proposed for &#8220;making it work&#8221;.  One involved selling Beer, which would provide an excuse for keeping teenagers out.  As if a group of tipsy black adults would be an improvement.</p>
<p>There are several &#8216;Film Festivals&rsquo; held in town (government money, ya know&hellip;), despite the fact that there is no Theater.</p>
<p>There are a couple of theaters in nearby white areas.  I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what they&rsquo;re like.  I haven&rsquo;t set foot in a cinema since we wasted money on &#8216;The Age of Innocence&rsquo; (a clueless piece of garbage), in 1993.  This was in a Cineplex in the &#8216;White County&rsquo;, miles from the edge of Jackson.  There was a group of White Trash teens in the back of that theater (the kind who go to public schools with blacks&hellip;and act like it), being disruptive.  My husband turned around just once, to see the source of the noise.  We were menaced, from that moment, until we made it out of the parking lot.  There&rsquo;s a fabulous new theater in our own little city.  But after eighteen years, I no longer view movie attendance as a possibility.  I love driving past the theater&rsquo;s grand façade, but will probably never set foot inside the place.  </p>
<p>Our parents ask why our children refuse to go to theaters, and seem afraid of crowds.  But our parents still live in 1947, when America was full of good people who behaved.  Our children and their friends live in a cocooned world of private schools and gated enclaves.  Frankly, their bunker mentality reminds me of the last humans left alive in a Zombie Movie.  But living in Mississippi, the Blackest State, frequently is like being in a Zombie Movie.  This (and worse) is what all of America will be like, in a very few years.</p>
<p>Early exposure to the &#8216;rest of Mississippi&rsquo;&hellip;school field trips to theaters, problematic trips to the Zoo, etc. &hellip;taught our kids what to avoid.  Avoiding the many classes and colors of dangerous trash here is second nature to them, as was researching crash ratings as the primary criterion for choosing their first cars (you never know when a speeding car full of you-know-whats is going to hit you, on the Jackson streets).  We expected the kids to go for showy cars. No. They thought almost solely about safety.</p>
<p>Jay, and Ellen, your posts reminded me of a story from a friend in Memphis, who, then a Teacher, was involved in taking a group of black Sixth-graders to a film at the Pink Palace Museum.  The other people in the auditorium were a group of nice Garden Club type ladies, all in their St. John Knit Suits&hellip;up from the Delta for the afternoon. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d been going to the Pink Palace since they were little girls (my Mom has such fond memories of the place).  As soon as the lights went down, the black kids, as if rehearsed, began chanting &#8220;GIT BUUUUUUUUUUK&hellip;GIT BUUUUUUK&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s when all the Garden Club ladies quickly exited the auditorium.  I&rsquo;m sure they every one pointed their Park Avenues and Towncars back toward the Delta, set the Cruise on 80, and haven&rsquo;t been back to Memphis since.  I haven&rsquo;t been there in decades, either.</p>
<p>But what made me laugh is Ellen&rsquo;s story.  I have a taste for Dark Comedy.  Such a compounding of absurdities.  Which class of victim prevails?  Does the Slavery Card trump the Shoah card?  Did Spielberg get an inkling of what will happen to Jews in a world dominated by non-whites?  Did it finally dawn on him that whites, alone, are capable of empathy for the plight of Jews during he Holocaust?  Did he finally realize that to the non-white world, he&rsquo;s just another WHITE PERSON?<br>

		<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. Whites, almost exclusively, are the inventors. Much of the innovation of the past forty years, when you think about it, has something or other to do with avoiding or dealing with the presence of blacks in our midst and equal  &mdash;  if not privileged  &mdash;  under the law: Home video, home computers and Internet access, tasers, pepper spray, surveillance cameras, the 911 system, steering column locks, motion detector alarms&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;American&rdquo; &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; SHOULD be planning a way to &ldquo;take back&rdquo; the &ldquo;motherland&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sorry for the &ldquo;quotes&rdquo; but they seem needed.</p>
<p>No one has been stopping them from migrating to Africa since 1865, if ever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be happier there, &amp; we&rsquo;d be happier here.</p>
<p>Puzzles me every day: they whine, but won&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>That would be nice Charlie:</p>
<p>But unfortunately for us whites, the American black knows enough to know that their sitaution here in America is one hundred times better than living in the Motherland, where they rightfully belong. They are like children in many ways, yes, they like to whine and play the race card, sue at the drop of a hat for imaginary racism, and pump out children like flies, but they still don&rsquo;t want to leave. They want it both ways. The only solution I can see is that hopefully someday, the white race as a whole will wake up,  and see the reality of what blacks are, and what they stand for, and stop associating with them, stop patronizing any of their businesses, don&rsquo;t have any business dealings with them, and start fighting for their rights. </p>

		<p>I teach at a school with an alternating day schedule. For some quirky scheduling reason, most of my students on A day are non-black. Most of my students on B day are black. Even though I&rsquo;m supposed to be teaching the same lessons to both groups, I have so much more freedom to work with the non-black group. We watch movies, have book discussions, do some creative writing, perform dialogues, etc. My black group gets mostly book work (reading comprehension is several grade levels lower than the non-black group). That&rsquo;s all they can handle without going to pieces, creating chaos, screaming, yelling, etc. And, ABROLUTELY no movies for the black group. Ever. Something about movies just sets them off.</p>
