			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simone Baribeau, Business Week, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 10-digit lottery number on a crumpled Church&rsquo;s Chicken receipt is Governor Luis Fortuno&rsquo;s solution for pulling Puerto Rico from its &#8220;lost decade&#8221; and may salvage his popularity.</p>
<p>The number, printed at a Ponce restaurant by a machine that reports sales directly to the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Treasury, seeks to turn every Puerto Rican into an enforcement agent. The program will give anyone with a receipt a chance to win $1,000 or a car, while forcing businesses to report and pay taxes.</p>
<p>Consumers have a &#8220;personal interest in making sure that the tax is collected and sent over to our local Treasury Department,&#8221; Fortuno, a 50-year-old Republican, said in an interview in his San Juan office.</p>
<p>Governors across the U.S. are confronting deficits that total $125 billion in the next fiscal year by cutting spending and raising money. {snip} Fortuno&rsquo;s approach is to crack down on cheating. His anti-tax-evasion policies will increase the commonwealth&rsquo;s projected $8.1 billion revenue by $305 million this year, Treasury Secretary Luis Puig said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p><b>Pervasive Evasion</b></p>
<p>Free lottery tickets may be more to the public&rsquo;s liking than other measures Fortuno took in his first two years in office. He sparked student strikes when he raised fees to help balance the university&rsquo;s budget. He prompted street protests when he fired workers to help bring the territory&rsquo;s deficit to $1 billion in the current fiscal year from 2009&rsquo;s $3.3 billion, the largest of any state&rsquo;s proportionate to revenue.</p>
<p>Now, still dealing with a contracting economy, Fortuno&rsquo;s tax overhaul may prove more popular. He promoted a measure last year to boost revenue by tightening the net on collections, and another to cut taxes, which the Legislature passed Jan 31.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The tax system is so oppressive that people basically want to avoid it,&#8221; he [Jose Villamil, chairman of Estudios Tecnicos, an economic consulting firm in San Juan] said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Tax evasion is pervasive; it includes high-income professions such as doctors and lawyers that collect fees in cash,&#8221; as well as people selling food and other items on the street.</p>
<p><b>Fixing the System</b></p>
<p>Fortuno&rsquo;s measures include requiring banks to provide income information on some borrowers, limits on a mortgage- interest deduction and penalties for corporate tax evasion. The moves, along with a temporary 4 percent excise tax on foreign manufacturers, will allow the territory to lower business levies an average of 30 percent and individual assessments by 50 percent over six years. Residents who earn less than $20,000 no longer have to pay income taxes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;No Decisions&rsquo;</p>
<p>The husband of real-estate attorney Luce Vela and father of 19-year-old triplets was executive director of Puerto Rico Tourism Co. and secretary of the Department of Economic Development and Commerce. In 2004, he was elected resident commissioner, the territory&rsquo;s non-voting member of Congress.</p>
<p><b>Hot Dogs, Too</b></p>
<p>The commonwealth began the lottery pilot program in December in about 200 businesses in Ponce, the second-largest city. Every receipt will be a free ticket for a twice-weekly drawing, said Puig.</p>
<p>All businesses will have a machine, even outdoor kiosks, which have a wireless version. Dixon Diaz, selling hot dogs at his father&rsquo;s cart in Ponce and handing out receipts, said the business had long paid taxes; others should as well.</p>

		<p>How many of you know that Puerto Rico&rsquo;s public pension system is only 10% funded?  It has just 10 cents for every dollar of pension liability.  Everywhere politicians buy votes by promising money they don&rsquo;t have, and nowhere is that more true than in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Of course our own federal government is in a hopeless fiscal position as well.  No one can seriously believe that the federal government will ever really pay off its debts.  Income taxes could double and we would still have a deficit, so anybody who thinks we&rsquo;ll get out of this mess simply by &#8220;taxing the rich&#8221; is misinformed.<br>

		<p>What is the story here?</p>
<p>This is not a story?</p>
<p>Many states use lotteries and casinos  for the same purpose.</p>
<p>They take grandpa&rsquo;s $1,000.000 farm and then brag up how they gave his grandson $500 to go toward his college.</p>
<p>Liars, Cheats, Hypocrites, YOU would go to jail for a lot less than this scam. They talk about that bum Madoff but he is a small potatoes to these Govt. Scams.</p>

		<p>Taiwan instituted something similar in the early 1990s.  It worked quite well (except for some businesses negotiating a discount if the customer didn&rsquo;t want a receipt).  </p>
<p>This system is a good free-market way to harness human greed for enforcing business honesty!   Puerto Ricans love lotteries, so it should be quite successful.  </p>

		<p>Speaking of cash strapped states and lotteries, I would have conversations with people on occasion about what we would do if we were ever so lucky to win the lottery.  (I do play on occasion, but not too often, because I have a schizophrenic view on lottos   &mdash;   On the one hand, they&rsquo;re a tax on people who haven&rsquo;t taken prob/stat.  On the other hand, they&rsquo;re by far the best chance the average person has to get rich.)  The debate is whether to take the whole jackpot in an annuity form over so many years (25-30, usually), or take the lump sum option that gives you a little more than half the jackpot, but gives it to you now.</p>
<p>In the past, my mindset was to calculate the reverse interest rate that you concede to the lotto system if you take the lump sum, and calculate it using the time value of money equation.  If I thought I could beat that number on the open market, then I&rsquo;d take the lump sum.  If not, then I&rsquo;d take the annuity.</p>
<p>However, with tight state budgets, and any number of states verily on the verge of bankruptcy, save the fact that they can&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re sovereign entities, I no longer think in those terms.  I get the feeling that people who have won big jackpots and are taking the annuity option are going to start getting the short end of the stick here pretty soon when state legislators start making tough choices.  For instance, let&rsquo;s say someone won a $300 million jackpot five years ago, and took the 30-year annuity option of $10 million a year for 30 years.  At the moment, the person would have already gotten 5 payments of $10m apiece for $50m total, and *should* be getting another $10m check some time this year.  But if this is in a state with big budget problems, like the one next door to me, I think these big yearly annuities are going to be too juicy of a target.  Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in the Illinois State legislature.  You can either spend $10 million on someone who already has gotten $50 million from the state, or to fund the pensions of retired DMV workers in Chicago.  Guess who&rsquo;s gonna get the short stick.  Right.  While the lotto winner could sue, there&rsquo;s probably not a judge in the state of IL, or anywhere in this world, that would order the state legislature to take money out of the hands of retired DMV workers whose only income are those pensions and give it to a person who already has $50 million.  Even if the judge finds for you, the judge has no standing law enforcement force to get blood out of that turnip.  The legislators will impeach the judge that makes such a ruling.</p>
<p>And yes, there is a racial and partisan angle.  If the lotto winner is white, and the other beneficiaries are black or Hispanic, you can bet that IL Democrats and even most of the useless geldings that pass for &#8220;Republicans&#8221; in IL will side with the minorities.</p>
<p>Therefore, my advice these days would be to take the lump sum.</p>

		<p>Why not JUST GIVE P.R. its independence? America foolishly acquired this poor, Spanish speaking island during the idiotic and needless Spanish-American war in 1898. P.R. has never been of any use to America and is a considerable burden. Time to cut our losses.</p>

		<p>Puerto Rico&rsquo;s low birth rate (about 1.8 children per woman), high emigration, and shrinking population mark it out more like a dysfunctional Balkan country such as Bulgaria rather than a part of the USA. The main difference is that it seems Bulgaria is still trying to recover (successfully, it seems) from the post-Communist hangover.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s funny is they still have this problem despite a HUGE advantage.  Residents of PR pay NO federal income taxes.  They could style themselves as a tax haven like Monaco or something but with the added advantage of being under the mighty US aegis.  Think of it, US companies would flock to PR where their well paid employees would pay NO federal income taxes while enjoying the tropical climate and perhaps paying some modest local taxes (eg sales, property) to finance basic services.</p>
<p>But no, their rulers want highly progressive taxes and so this is where they&rsquo;re at.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m far from an expert, but my impression is that tax evasion is rampant and pervasive in Latin America. There just isn&rsquo;t a civic culture in Latin America of paying into a public system that functions well at providing services from which everyone can benefit. </p>
<p>My most immediate experience of this was from visiting Costa Rica where a relative of mine decided to live as an emigre for about 10 years or so. My understanding was that very few people paid income taxes. As a result tax rates were very high in order to just try to collect a little bit of what the government needed to provide basic services. These crazily high tax rates only served to exacerbate the problem because it established a norm where you would have to be foolish to pay such high rates when most people weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>As a result much of Costa Rica&rsquo;s public funding came from taxes on imports, which raised the price of consumer goods like cars and televisions very high and out of the reach of most average Costa Ricans. Which meant that owning something like a tv or a car immediately made you a glaringly obvious target for theft. </p>
<p>Such a beautiful country.</p>

<p>Puerto Rico has a carnival government.<br>
An abstract reflection of mans desire for a standard of living bigger than himself.</p>
<p>Amalgamated into sameness, and trapped between torment and the rush of the next lottery, their greatest milestone in life may be not to succeed alongside other nations, but to humble to the fact that their Socialism married them to an illusion of knowledge and that ignorance was not their greatest enemy.</p>

		<p>It must be rather hard indeed to collect taxes from the portion of the population that is too poor to pay any, and the other that is intelligent enough to get around doing so.  While not entirely relevant, I remember reading an old joke about Puerto Rico on these very comment boards and I&rsquo;d like to share it(apologies, it&rsquo;s been a while and I&rsquo;m probably going to butcher it horribly). </p>
<p>A white liberal from New York arrives in Puerto Rico for a delightful vacation.  However, shortly after arriving he notices something amiss.  Almost all of the people around him are white looking - and they aren&rsquo;t tourists!  They look nothing like the many Puerto Ricans he knows.  After entering a nearby bar, he asks the following question of the bartender, &#8220;Where are all the dark skinned Puerto Ricans?&#8221;  The bartender raises an eyebrow and replies, &#8220;New York, of course.&#8221;</p>
