<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jose Oswaldo Reyes Alfaro, an illegal immigrant who was ordered deported to El Salvador a decade ago but never left, was charged in the pair of attacks just blocks apart Thursday night that left three people dead and three others injured, Manassas Police Chief Doug Keen said.</p>
<p>{snip} Reyes Alfaro had a relationship of some sort with all the victims. Police are still investigating the exact nature of those relationships.</p>
<p>Keen said 56-year-old Brenda Ashcraft and 37-year-old William Ashcraft were killed in the first attack. A 34-year-old woman was injured and remains hospitalized, and a 15-year-old girl was treated and released. In the second attack, Keen said 48-year-old Julio Cesar Ulloa was killed, and a 77-year-old woman suffered head wounds from a large knife. The other victims were all shot.<br/>

		<p>This incident has similarities to what happened in San Francisco in June 2008.  A Salvadorian MS-13 street thug killed a father and two his two teenage sons in a car to car shooting.  He should have been legally deported earlier because of his criminal activity, but he was not because of the sanctuary city policy that the board of stuporvisors enacted  .I wrote a letter to the new District Attorney, George Gascon, urging him to seek the Death Penalty for the perp that did it.  I am sure that he will not heed it.</p>

		<p><i>Brenda Ashcraft&rsquo;s niece, Melissa King, said Friday that her aunt had been a victim of domestic violence by her boyfriend, whom she only knew as &#8220;Jose.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Remember (of course you do) the furor in the press over whether the Palin target map influenced the shooter in Tucson, even though there was no proof he ever saw the graphic?  The policies and beliefs of Giffords&rsquo; party when it comes to immigration has directly led to the mass murder and/or mass rape of thousands.  That&rsquo;s why I gagged when I saw that film clip of Giffords whining about the target map and having the nerve to say &#8220;they&rsquo;ve got to realize there&rsquo;s consequences to that action.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s consequences to Liberal/Democratic Party beliefs about immigration, this story is one; so&rsquo;s the huge number of murder suspects in America that are believed to be hiding out in Mexico.   Giffords was just another elitist hypocritically worried about her own hide while she gave support to a party that is responsible for enabling thousands of murders of &#8220;little people.&#8221;  There is indeed consequences to actions and beliefs,  but you&rsquo;ll never hear the press speculating about the connection of the Left to cases like this. </p>

<p>Not only are they not heeding your letter, the brain-dead voters of the state elected the D.A. responsible for that case and partially for SF&rsquo;s sanctuary policy, Kamala Harris, the Attorney General of the state.</p>

<p>Not just supporting immigration, but deliberately promoting blatant lies on race and racial relations. Deliberately misinforming children/young/students, planting in their heads fantasies instead of reality.</p>

		<p>Dear Poster Number ( 2 ) PEEJAY:</p>
<p>You are so right and if the honorable, District Attorney, George Gascon really wants to show how open, forgiving and kind he can be to someone who wipes out someone elses innocent family members, (NOT HIS FAMILY MEMBERS) he should offer the young man a ROOM IN HIS HOUSE until the poor guy can get on his feet?</p>
