<h1>White Supremacist Group Considers Suing Charlotte</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard DeVayne, WCNC-TV (Charlotte), January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jared Taylor said he wants apologies from City Council member Warren Turner and Mayor Pro-tem Patrick Cannon because they worked to keep his group from holding its convention in Charlotte.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m shocked I&rsquo;m astonished the idea that an elected city council member, the second highest in this city should try to out pressure or imply pressure to chase business away just because he disagree with us,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;Really, really, that&rsquo;s bad behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we spoke with Cannon, he said he did not send out an e-mail that was against the group coming to Charlotte. He added that he personally did not have enough time to contact all the hotels in the area. And he was just keeping some of his constituents informed.</p>
<p>NewsChannel 36 did obtain a copy of the email sent from Cannon&rsquo;s personal account and it reads:<blockquote><i>Subject: Re: Southern Anti-Racist Network </p>
<p>I have all hotels, motels, and gotels on notice and they seem to be cooperating well still. An attempt was made for accommodations at another hotel but based on what I ask to take place they were denied again. It&rsquo;s my thought that they will still try over and over even if they end up in Cabarras County or Rock Hill. I will keep the level of intelligence up as best I can.</i><br>

		<p>If that is indeed the email, I&rsquo;m guessing Cannon has gifted AmRen a confession.  From the subject line it appears that the Southern Anti-Racist Network and neo-Stalinist Leonard Zeskind were also involved in the conspiracy to deny and deprive Mr. Taylor and many others their constitutionally guaranteed rights. </p>
<p>Sue them all. </p>

		<p>By all means, please sue for as much as you can get.  Sue under the fourteenth amendment, any state provisions, any local ordinance, anything.  Sue these boobs personally as well as the city and even the state.  However, you should give some thought that future conferences be held where you can be more assured of a welcome.  Maybe such a place would be more out of the way, less able to accommodate a number of people, but it would be better to know that you have spent your money on people who appreciate the business, and there&rsquo;s less likelihood of anyone spitting in your food, as Jesse Jackson used to do so many years ago.</p>

		<p>I think the threat of legal action, and the actual pursuit of it, is the only way to go for Amren.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Amren has a very good chance at getting a large settlement from the city if they follow through and pursue the case or even if they settle out of court.</p>
<p>Kudos to Jared Taylor.  I&rsquo;m willing to contribute to a legal fund.</p>

		<p>When Enoch Powell made his great &#8216;rivers of blood&rsquo; speech, that point by point has come true, he claimed he was merely speaking up for local constituents. He did say, at the end, that to say nothing would be the greatest crime of all. Actually, the only way to inform the citizens of Charlotte would be to allow Taylor to speak.  </p>

		<p>VDARE has this absolutely correct. Cannon has no concept of<br>
any of the Constitutional principles of free speech, open discourse, or even reason itself. He simply cannot conceive<br>
of justice or freedom except as the free distribution of<br>
wealth along racial lines. What this evinces is a massive<br>
psychological gap that for all intents and purposes might as<br>
well be called genetic. Humans cannot change their eye<br>
color and Blacks simply cannot change or question their<br>
own own psychological coding. They are slaves..not by <br>
white mans rules&hellip;slavery is long over..they are slaves<br>
because they have resigned to unreason. This is why debate<br>
is so terrifying to them. This why they are eager to give<br>
into every impulse, every instinctual drive&hellip;sex, violence,<br>
rhythm, dance, and all the criminal variations of it. Anything<br>
anything is better than being aware of their own incapacity <br>
to think.</p>

		<p>When you get your apology, then double your efforts and demand their resignations.</p>
<p>Some sins are unforgivable.</p>
<p>We just can&rsquo;t afford to miss any more opportunities to bring about justice and equality.</p>
<p>We must heed the calls from a better future by answering injustice with justice.</p>
<p>All the whining blah, blah, blah that fills the news every day.  Use it! It works!</p>
<p>Do to them what Al Scam Sharpie did to Don Imus.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor&rsquo;s failure is in not having ALREADY started the boycott petitions against the hotel chain and Charlotte.</p>
<p>Start putting pressure on anyone who would attend the 2012 Dem. Convention: anyone not boycotting Charlotte 2012 is for bigotry, extremism, thuggery, and hate.  Stand in solidarity of inclusion, mainstream and civil discourse, and equal rights for all.  Stand against Charlotte 2012.</p>
<p>That game is played over and over again, and it always works. Time for Jared Taylor to start playing it to win. We can&rsquo;t wait any longer.  </p>

		<p>I know Mr. Taylor and all those who look forward to the conference are upset at the situation in NC. However the truth is the impact of this issue is having a greater impact on the White community than the conference itself could ever had. AR has won this battle hands down and should take every opportunity to capitalize on it this upcoming week.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;White Supremacist Group&#8221; should also demand an apology from Richard DeVayne, or whomever wrote that headline. Seriously, there are plenty of actual White Supremacist groups on the web, and I feel the need to take a long shower if I spend more than a couple of minutes on any of them. I come here exactly because it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a hate-fest, yet honestly addresses issues that other PC-addled media outlets are too terrified/brainwashed to deal with.</p>

		<p>It sounds to me like the city officials are definitely backpedaling here. Getting involved here was the biggest mistake they could make, because it implicated they entire city in the denial of a group&rsquo;s civil rights. </p>
<p>By denying that they were attempting to block the conference, they are as much as admitting that it would be wrong to do so. Now the next obvious step is to show their good faith by working to get the conference reinstated. </p>
<p>Perhaps this will make it harder for others to attempt to block the conference in the future. Let us hope so.</p>

<p>Though I think that something must be done to Turner and Cannon for abusing their power, I feel as if we&rsquo;re being a bit hypocritical in asking for an apology.  I personally am disgusted every time I hear a minority ask for apologies for something that was done to their ancestors, or for something that happened in the workplace, something that was said on television, etc.  Instead of asking for an apology, or suing (think how it makes you feel when a black asks for slavery reparations), isn&rsquo;t there some other way Taylor and American Renaissance could use the situation?</p>

		<p>The media is actually very keen on this. By calling us &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; and &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; they will instantly turn most people against us. Of course, the NAACP is never a black supremacist group despite pushing for quotas, historically black colleges, hate crime double standards and &#8220;reparations.&#8221; It is a rigged game and that is why we always lose.</p>

		<p>I think it was in the &rsquo;70s when John Lennon and Yoko Ono visited Toronto. They hired a skywriter and had some words about peace or war (I forget exactly) written across the sky of Toronto. It sure got everyone&rsquo;s attention. So I&rsquo;m thinking the letters &#8220;AR&#8221; would look good over Charlotte.</p>

		<p>Jared was very smooth, confident and well spoken. Patrick Cannon was not. The media seems to have spun this in a favorable way. </p>
<p>Sue em&rsquo; if they don&rsquo;t back down and grovel (and they likely won&rsquo;t so go through the motions as budget allows). I sent a modest $50 in for the cause and hope others will offer support as well. </p>
<p>Also please do consider places like Vegas, those big hotels may not have the small wholesome feel but Vegas is not likely to put on or tolerate political shenigans. Vegas spends big bucks on tourism advertisements and they won&rsquo;t get into such petty squabbles that could dampen their image.</p>

		<p>My last year as a resident of liberal/socialist N.J.was 2002 A.D.; I drove the 240 miles South to Northern Va. (A Dulles Airport hotel )and attended a very constitutional, non -biased, pro-Original American, aka, Euro-White Culture person). I knew from my own varied life experiences about how anti-White and self-destructive the American Federal System has become since 1964 A.D. .If an Original-American feels &#8221; superior &#8220;, it is the fault of all non-Caucasians who insist on living with us in our culture / country rather than their own and be independant of us ; marrying us and our federal government racist laws against Euro-stock people since the &rsquo; 60&rsquo;s. How else is one to feel; plus observing non-White contributions or lack of, in American Society ?</p>

<p>The difference is that Mr. Taylor and Amren are now in the position of being able to turn the tables on these black racists and use the same weapons against <i>them</i> that have for so long been used against <i>us</i>.  Seeing such an outcome, Patrick Cannon and his ilk across the land might think twice about trying such stunts again.  And it might well embolden more Whites to start pushing back, as well.</p>
<p>I want them all to endure the personal embarrassment   &mdash;   perhaps even humiliation   &mdash;   of having to issue a public apology, like the ritual groveling required of any White who dares displease the great black and brown god.  And if Jared Taylor &amp; Company think they can successfully carry out a lawsuit (good luck finding an impartial jury in Charlotte), so much the better.  White-haters everywhere need to discover that, starting now, prodding Whitey is going to get their fingers burned.<br>

Tell the mayor the more he fights, the more ordinary citizens are going to be reminded of us by the news&hellip;more supporters will gather. Like the famous line in the film Field of Dreams, &#8220;BUILD IT, AND THEY WILL COME&hellip;&#8221;.<br>
maybe that&rsquo;ll ruffle their feathers a bit when we build an event?</p>
<p>If all else fails Jared&hellip;take the conference to Wahsington D.C. and let US cover the martin luther statue with a wooden box, like the blacks did with our first and founding president! </p>
<p>I remember going to charlotte in 2009, and yes I&rsquo;ve been proven that city can be racist..and I have the proof and willing to share it! I recorded a short amount outside a church on my vidcam with all blacks preaching jesse jackson this&hellip;and that&hellip;and that&hellip;and this&hellip;<br>
Couldn&rsquo;t hear much of what they said&hellip;but a group of blacks just mentioning jesse jackson with a loud speaker handheld on the corner of a city block&hellip;well, you know what the subject is!</p>
<p>Good luck Jared! </p>

		<p>That video clip is an excellent example of the attitudes were up against. That young man, my age probably, wouldn&rsquo;t even shake Jared&rsquo;s hand. I&rsquo;d shake Louis Farrakhan&rsquo;s hand if he ever offered it, I&rsquo;m not afraid of what he has to say. It&rsquo;s just a handshake. The left is horrified by AmRen because Jared and the newsletter&rsquo;s arguments are factual and logical. </p>
<p>As someone who has a very public job it is infuriating to me that my opinions, opinions I&rsquo;ve come to form carefully, are shunned without consideration. How many of us reading this went and sought to be &#8220;race realists?&#8221; I myself was a rabid race denier up until a few years ago. I came to appreciate AmRen&rsquo;s message because it makes sense, not because I have some sort of vendetta against blacks. The only black person I even knew growing up was a smart, courteous kid. </p>
<p>The blatant hypocrisy that is staring anti-racists and the media in the face should be unavoidable. Maybe we should stick their noses in it a little closer?</p>

<p>It seems that Cannon has abused his position and authority to block lawful assembly of a private organization for his own political purposes.  There was no overarching need for this, thus no legal justification, making it most likely an illegal act.  A fair minded prosecuter could surely cite the statute that would prove this act by Cannon illegal.  Abuse of public office is no trivial matter.  It would seem most advisable to press charges.</p>

		<p>Dear Conference Registrant,</p>
<p>I am very sorry to inform you that the AR conference scheduled for February 4 through 6 must be canceled. Despite strong assurances that it would not submit to pressure, the hotel with which we had initially contracted has broken its contract with us. We have investigated many possible alternative venues but have not been able to find one.</p>
<p>There is evidence that at least one elected Charlotte official was working behind the scenes to deny us a venue, and our legal counsel is looking into grounds for action against the city.</p>
<p>We are deeply sorry for the great inconvenience this causes you, and I apologize to you personally. As the head of the publication that organized this conference, the fault is entirely mine.</p>
<p>At your instruction we will, of course, refund all registrations and banquet fees.</p>
<p>Many of you will have bought non-refundable air tickets. Generally, the amount spent on such tickets can, for a period of a year, be used to buy a different ticket on the same airline. However, most airlines then deduct $150 from the amount that can be spent to buy the new ticket. If you bought a non-refundable ticket, please send us proof of purchase and we will send you a check for $150. We do not want anyone to suffer financial loss because of this cancellation.</p>
<p>We have heard that because of the impending storms, some airlines are offering full refunds on &ldquo;non-refundable&rdquo; tickets. This offer may not apply to tickets for February 4, but it may be worth inquiring.</p>
<p>We are considering alternative models for future American Renaissance conferences.</p>
<p>Again, please accept my sincerest apologies. We greatly value your continuing support, and deeply regret that we will not be seeing you on February 4.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Jared Taylor<br>
</p>

		<p>For Amreners, just some basic background information on the Charlotte black political culture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Local-naacp-chapter-threatens-charlotte-dnc-bid&rsquo; (15 Oct 2010) <br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/9ZJGs" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/9ZJGs</a> <br>
&hellip;.&rdquo;A dispute over closing some of Charlotte schools led to the arrest of Charlotte&rsquo;s NAACP President (the &lsquo;reverend&rsquo; Kojo Nantambu). Now the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County NAACP is threatening to end Charlotte&rsquo;s chances of hosting the 2012 Democratic National Convention&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And then more recently there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Backlash over MLK Snow Day Decision Continues&rsquo; (17 Jan 2011)<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/fs1gx" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/fs1gx</a>  (Story from Fox News Charlotte) <br>
&hellip;&rdquo;The NAACP held a protest in Uptown Charlotte on Monday, and Nantambu says the group plans to ask organizations like the *CIAA and the **NCAA to not bring their events to what he calls a racist city&rdquo;.</p>
<p>*Established in 1912, the *CIAA is the nation&rsquo;s oldest black athletic conference, rich in history and heritage. The presence of the CIAA as a premiere member of the **National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II  https://goo.gl/k3dKx<br>
  <br>
&lsquo;Mayor Foxx, CIAA say no to NAACP&rsquo;s call for boycott&rsquo; (20 Jan)<br>
https://goo.gl/XaPpo <br>
&hellip;&ldquo;Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx says he is opposed with any effort by the NAACP to seek a boycott of major events in Charlotte and disagrees with a description of the city as a &#8220;racist city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this sound right; considering the last couple of day&rsquo;s events?</p>
<p>&hellip;&rdquo;Foxx was responding to comments made Monday by Kojo Nantambu, head of Charlotte&rsquo;s NAACP chapter, who called the city a &#8220;racist bastion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you have only a week later, Mr Patrick Cannon who from his own bio( https://goo.gl/UrVmt ) has a &ldquo;NAACP Life Member Award from President &amp; CEO Kwame&rsquo; Mfume&rdquo;, &ldquo;Best City Councilperson, two time recipient of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg NAACP Distinguished Service Award&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Acting aggressively, unlawfully and unethically to stop the 2011 Amren conference being staged in NC.  <br>
Then the coincidentally timed payoff seems to be&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlotte-to-host-2012-Democratic-National-Convention&rsquo;<br>
https://goo.gl/uepyq ( 1st Feb )<br>
&hellip; &ldquo;Charlotte as the leader of the New South&rdquo; {snip}<br>
&hellip;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also the first time since 1888 that the Democrats have held a convention in the South.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;First Lady Michelle Obama gave Charlotte a glowing review in an e-mail to campaign supporters Tuesday&#8221;&hellip;<br>
&hellip;&#8221;Vibrant, diverse, and full of opportunity, the Queen City is home to innovative, hardworking folks with big hearts and <b>open minds(?)</b>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To sum up; Pro black NAACP complains about majority black schools closing and the black deity MLK snow day issue, calls the majority black Charlotte council racist (?), threatens to boycott and to shut down big money events such as black athletic CIAA conference and black president DNC unless their demands are met. <br>
Then the Pro White Amren conference is illegally and unethically made the sacrificial lamb, to appease the pro black (&lsquo;anti&rsquo;) racists and Charlotte gets its two big money conferences. </p>
<p>I doubt there&rsquo;s a conspiracy here, but where is the White political power in all of this? Considering that African Americans are only 13% of the national population and 33.5% of the Charlotte-Gastonia-Salisbury area, they sure do seem to be consolidating their political power, while we Whites are in comparison, invisible.</p>
<p>To add, I was curious to the media in attendances reaction to Mr Taylor&rsquo;s excellent news conference the other day, and from simply reading the microphone labels from the photos and some googling (roughly in best to worst order)&hellip;..</p>
<p>-Channel 36 WCNC (NBC/ MSNBC &amp; Charlotteobserver.com affiliate/partner) <br>

This story was also carried on the NC section of the MSNBC national news site. <a href="https://goo.gl/a2GFU" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/a2GFU</a>  <br>
MSNBC actually has a whole &lsquo;Race and ethnicity&rsquo; section, but alas with no mention of this story there though. <a href="https://goo.gl/g0jxa" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/g0jxa</a> </p>
<p>This is also the exact same original article featured for this thread, complete with the &ldquo;Southern Anti-Racist Network&rdquo; email. </p>
<p>Of course the term &lsquo;Anti-Racist&rsquo; has been mentioned on this site before many times before, as being a euphemism for &lsquo;anti-White&rsquo;. </p>

<p>And finally there&rsquo;s:<br>
-Fox Charlotte (Fox broadcasting)<br>
Although, Fox Charlotte had a news team covering Mr Taylor&rsquo;s press conference, they were the only broad caster (that I could see) who have posted absolutely no follow up story on this issue what so ever, beyond the earlier pre conference story&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;White Supremacy Group To Hold News Conference in Charlotte&rsquo;(30 Jan) <a href="https://goo.gl/8XVpR" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/8XVpR</a>  <br>
Note that Fox News Charlotte also had no problem voicing the NAACP threatening to boycott &lsquo;racist&rsquo; events in Charlotte a fortnight earlier, in the first link of this post. <br>
This is pretty rich, also considering how quickly Fox news leapt at the chance to falsely point the finger at Amren only a couple of weeks ago during another removed, but very emotionally charged and tragic situation that then had the nation&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Thankfully more of us are waking up everyday.</p>

Though I think that something must be done to Turner and Cannon for abusing their power, I feel as if we&rsquo;re being a bit hypocritical in asking for an apology. I personally am disgusted every time I hear a minority ask for apologies for something that was done to their ancestors, or for something that happened in the workplace, something that was said on television, etc. Instead of asking for an apology, or suing (think how it makes you feel when a black asks for slavery reparations), isn&rsquo;t there some other way Taylor and American Renaissance could use the situation?<br>
__________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Good point, but the problem is that AmRen has to somehow salvage what is a bad turn of events. I maintain that it would have been much better for AmRen to have had a successful conference especially after the defeat last time. Well that horse is out of the barn now, so the next best thing to do is file suit.</p>
<p>But it should be underscored that this is no victory of any kind, given that once again AmRen&rsquo;s ability to freely associate has been interfered with. I do agree with the previous post though, the apology request is unnecessary, and frankly if this had happened to some nonwhite group they would be calling for resignations!</p>

		<p>It would be a fine day if Amren were to receive some compensation from the C.of Charlotte for this outrage. The Court system is loathe to do anything for groups such as these. On the other hand, the Federal Courts have given the NAACP anything they wanted over a period of decades. It makes for interesting if  dry reading to review the legal history of this subject. The same holds true for Native American litigation involving land rights, enviornmental laws, etc. As the Amren supportes know the system is effectively rigged agains them. Litigation at this level requires large resources and political clout. Alas</p>

<p>When I saw the notices for this year&rsquo;s conference I rejoiced in the wording. They were confident words. I figured everything was under control-that the cowardly self-named antiracist factions were set to be stymied in their underhanded tactics.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even concerned two days ago when the hotel wimped out. I was SURE you had things under control. For example, hustle the conferees into the front door of a hotel then straight out the back door to waiting shuttles which would go to the TRUE conference milieu.</p>
<p>I also would be glad to contribute to a legal offensive. It seems the only option right now.</p>

		<p>I am half white/black, and yes, I was a registrant at the upcoming conference this weekend. To call it a &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221; Conference is not only misleading, but very uncharitable, to say nothing of being dishonest.</p>
<p>It is glaringly obvious to me after this fiasco, that in America today, to be White  &mdash;  -and to have the audacity to argue for your own self-interests, is something to be looked down upon and proscribed.  (Never mind that nonetheless, the non-white world will clamor for all the accouterments that western society has given to the planet&hellip;you know, those same Whites who &#8220;oppress&#8221; everyone; but that&rsquo;s another matter.)</p>
<p>The hypocrisy of Cannon and others in the Charlotte government is deeply disturbing, and frankly, unconscionable. He does not believe in the constitutional principles of free speech, free association, and the right to assemble.  His poorly worded email demonstrates this.</p>
<p>To the college-aged kid who refused Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s handshake:  You&rsquo;re young, you&rsquo;re naive, and somewhat rude&hellip;but you&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn.  Don&rsquo;t be so quick to swallow everything you hear in the media and read in your college textbooks.  The exigencies of the real world will hit you soon enough.  Then you might understand.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When we spoke with Cannon, he said he did not send out an e-mail that was against the group coming to Charlotte. He added that he personally did not have enough time to contact all the hotels in the area. And he was just keeping some of his constituents informed.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>DECONSTRUCTION: No, he did not send out an e-mail against AR&rsquo;s coming to town. He sent out an e-mail to people (reputedly some of his constituents) to keep them informed of what he had done elsewise  &mdash;   presumably by telephoning and/or sending letters via the U.S.P.S. He did not have enough time to do so personally, yet his e-mail claims that all such public accommodations have been &#8220;put on notice,&#8221; and that they seemed to be cooperating. Thus, he had help  &mdash;   whether from his official office personal, one or more NGO(s), unaffiliated volunteers, or merely his own family and friends  &mdash;   in putting those hospitality businesses on notice; the fact that all of the latter appeared to him to be cooperating means that they were contacted with the purpose of getting them to act in accordance with his own wishes, and not merely to keep them informed of circumstances, as he claims to have been doing vis-a-vis his own constituents, with his cited e-mail message.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Cannon need not be lying per se to the news media now, as so many here assume; yet, reading between the lines of his denials, in light of his cited e-mail message, does give one a rather good  &mdash;   if damning  &mdash;   view of what has transpired between Mr. Cannon and the local hospitality industry in his successful attempt to stop the 2011 AR conference from going forward this weekend. Chances are good that the actual contacts between Mr. Cannon&rsquo;s team and the businesses were done by telephone, so that there would be no record of the contents, even if there were of the fact of those contacts themselves. It would likely take a lawsuit&rsquo;s forcing depositions under oath to discover what was discussed during those contacts, and whether that rises to the level of either a tortious interference with contractual rights, and/or a denial of civil rights done under the color of law (i.e., Mr. Cannon&rsquo;s appearing to act in his capacity as an elected city official, rather than as a private citizen).</p>

<p>Also, I must ask, does AmRen really need to have a conference? Why not an internet symposium? I know that people like to mingle with &#8216;their own kind,&rsquo; to &#8220;be among the living again,&#8221; but what does that really do for the cause? Presumably, anyone that is willing to spend $1,000 or so to attend a conference is already convinced of the justice of our cause, and so the conference is little more than a morale boaster.

Presumably, anyone that is willing to spend $1,000 or so to attend a conference is already convinced of the justice of our cause, and so the conference is little more than a morale boaster. The internet-site however, reaches hundreds of fence-sitters everyday. </b></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was thinking.  With technology these days, you don&rsquo;t need meetings or conference rooms really.  Plus it would save members the cost of getting a plane ticket and hotel room and other expenses.  Plus he&rsquo;d reach more people that way as you stated.</p>

		<p>That email is the smoking gun (oops, I said &#8220;gun&#8221;&hellip;sorry for the suggestively violent vitriol.) Without that email, I&rsquo;m not sure AMREN would have much of a case. With it, legal victory is a safe bet.</p>
<p>Also, I should mention - the severe winter the East Coast, South and Midwest have experienced works in AMREN&rsquo;S favor. Why? Because meeting outside somewhere just isn&rsquo;t an option. Actively sabotaging indoor accomodations means sabotaging freedom of assembly, and therefore free speech.</p>
<p>You can tell Cannon is nervous. He&rsquo;s smart enough to know the implications of what he&rsquo;s done. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s been denying ever having contacted any hotels (which has, of course, been proved a lie.)</p>

		<p>These assaults on your rights are not going to stop Mr Taylor, until you do something about it. A huge judgement in your favor in this case, will give others reason to think twice before infringing on your (and others) rights. </p>
<p>What gets my goat more than anything else in this fiasco, is the fact that these racists waited till practically the last minute before they pressured the hotel to cancel on you. In this manner, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for you to make other arrangements. I am quite sure this was done with intent.</p>
<p>These racists feel they have the right to mess with people&rsquo;s rights with impunity. I hope you show them that they are mistaken. A long, expensive, media reported trial, would do just that. PLEASE procede with a lawsuit. Im sure most here would donate to a legal fund, if nessessary. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with those saying &#8220;why do we need a conference, we can just &#8220;meet&#8221; online&#8221;. You&rsquo;re missing the point. Don&rsquo;t you think that our enemies will just figure out a way to block that too? Then what? These two racist clowns - Warren Turner-Patrick Cannon - don&rsquo;t WANT the truth to get out because they know that will be the end of their racism gravey train, which they rode all the way to where they are now. The truth to them is what a daggar, daylight and holy water is to a vampire. They don&rsquo;t want White Americans to see the daylight either. This is America, and we&rsquo;ve got every right to hold a real conference anywhere we choose just as the NAACP,Louis Farrakhan and La&rsquo;racea&rsquo; does, if not more so. No hotel in the country would dream of canceling them no matter how intense the pressure for fear of being called a &#8216;racisss&rsquo;. You can bet that the NAACP and La&rsquo;racea&rsquo; would be talking boycotts, marches and lawsuits, not &#8220;well we&rsquo;ll just have to meet online I quess&#8221;.<br>
SUE THEM ALREADY! AND SUE TURNER - CANNON ALSO!! </p>

		<p>This morning, I learned that the conference had been cancelled, but the videostreaming would take place with people being able to see and hear the speakers from their computers, cellphones, etc. </p>
<p>This is the second year such has happened and, frankly, I think its a waste of time and effort to try to hold a conference at a hotel because some hot-head is going to stand in your way again, inconviencing a lot of people who have made airline reservations, taken time off from work, and are now stuck with non-refundable plane tickets. One would hope that the hotel refunds the people&rsquo;s deposits. </p>
<p>In the future, videostream a selected group of speakers from undisclosed locations for their safety and encourage small groups to meet in private homes where they can watch the speakers and still socialize together afterwards. </p>

		<p><i>Blacks get millions when someone &ldquo;violates their civil rights&rdquo; so why shouldn&rsquo;t we?</i> - MikeH @ #37.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has already explained this. It&rsquo;s because White people are not a &#8220;Protected Group&#8221;.</p>
<p>GenX ANZAC # 41 - Thanks for the background.  I was wondering, as I read other news items about black riots in Charlotte this last week, what on earth was Amren thinking? Holding a conference in enemy territory?  With a black-controlled city council?  After last year, did you really think you would be allowed to meet?</p>
<p>I was in Virginia last month, and considered staying over for the conference.  Obviously, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t.  If I attend a conference for White interests, I don&rsquo;t want to do it surrounded by blacks.  I couldn&rsquo;t eat the hotel food, bearing in mind how Jesse Jackson boasted that, as a waiter, he used to spit in the White people&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>Learn a lesson.  You should have done it last year. Hold your conference in the summer. Do it in a White town. Have tents in reserve. Organize a barbecue in a public park. Just, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, stop losing.</p>
<p>What will it take to make you mad enough to start fighting back?</p>

		<p>Assuming that you are able to document your facts, including dollar damages for AmRen and its attendees, you have ample basis for a successful civil suit against (1) Sheraton Hotels for breach of contract, and (2) Mr. Cannon and the city of Charlotte for tortious interference with the contract.  With any luck you may also win a judgment for your attorney fees in addition to compensatory damages.</p>
<p>You should file a civil rights complaint with the local FBI office and with the US Dept of Justice.  This is, after all, plainly an act of tyranny by the city of Charlotte.  It would be instructive to see which side the regime takes when it comes to tyranny.  Are they for it, or against it?  Let&rsquo;s get them on the record.</p>

<p>It can&rsquo;t be in a public place (no way to manage protesters), but I agree, Amren needs to get creative.  Pick a hotel but don&rsquo;t book it, just tell registrants you suggest that hotel (on the phone when they register) so they can book their OWN rooms and the hotel can&rsquo;t cancel.</p>
<p>Next pick a couple of conference venues nearby location and keep it secret! When conference attendees arrive they can call a number 2 hours before each event and get the location (i.e. at 6 pm they can call and learn about an informal meet and greet at the ___ hotel bar. Next morning they can call and find out the conference starts at 9 am in &#8220;ballroom C at such and such a hotel&#8221;. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep your eggs in one basket. It is easy to identify the conference and shut it down when it is all in one place, it is a lot harder to say &#8220;it is rumored there is a WN group planning to have various events at different locations around the city&#8221;.</p>
<p>And choose a city that is large enough to have many many venues. Cities with casinos are a great idea, you don&rsquo;t need to tell a large casino there &#8221; might be protesters&#8221; just let them deal with any rabble rousers that dare show up (and they will!). The little anti-fa people are not going to want to deal with the security or interrupt the operations of a large casino.</p>

		<p>By all means sue.  I&rsquo;m horribly ashamed of my city and where it&rsquo;s headed.  There&rsquo;s been a near euphoric delight at the announcement that the DNC is holding it&rsquo;s 2012 convention here, along with all the extremist groups the left tags along.  Yet, Amren has been painted as a white &#8220;supremacist&#8221; and extremist group by all the local media without ever even reading what this site is all about.  They didn&rsquo;t even bother to quote anything from the &#8220;About Us&#8221; section of this site.</p>
<p>Someone needs to stand up for equality.  I&rsquo;m glad Amren got all this coverage.  It brought your organization to a lot of people&rsquo;s attention (like me).  </p>
<p>Sue, sue, sue the city.  It&rsquo;s obvious they are abusing their power from the email we&rsquo;ve seen.  I&rsquo;d like to see my tax dollars going to something useful for a change&hellip;like supporting Amren! </p>

		<p>Somewhat of a dissident view here but:</p>
<p>Sue the hotel.</p>
<p>Sue and win, so that hotels in America know that breaking contract with a group for a few complaints about the content of their message is illegal.</p>
<p>Hotels: you make the contract, you honor it. And if you&rsquo;re granting a space for the NAACP to talk, you&rsquo;ve got to honor one of the other sides as well.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor presents himself better in interview format than most presidential candidates. I&rsquo;m sorry we have not had the pleasure of seeing him occupy the spaces wasted on people like John Edwards.</p>
