			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reginald Fields, Plain Dealer (Cleveland), February 14, 2001</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. John Kasich on Monday met with members of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus in an effort to ease the racial tension that was sparked between the two sides last month over the Republican leader&rsquo;s initial hiring of an all-white Cabinet.</p>
<p>OLBC chair Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat, called the meeting a positive step and said both sides agreed to show more respect for one another and make a good faith effort to work together on legislative issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that the governor said is that he realized, based on the conversations we had, that he didn&rsquo;t do some things right,&#8221; said Williams. &#8220;He has agreed to have open dialogue with us. We definitely think this was a step in the positive direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kasich&rsquo;s spokesman Rob Nichols agreed with Williams that the meeting was worthwhile and said the governor took the opportunity to clarify his earlier position on diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a good meeting. It confirmed what the governor has said all along that he is committed to diversity,&#8221; Nichols said. &#8220;He recognizes that diversity is something that you continue to work for, continue to strive for.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day it is also about sharing his vision for governance, so, you know, he&rsquo;s not going to appoint a bunch of liberal Democrats to his Cabinet positions,&#8221; Nichols said. &#8220;But diversity in itself is something he will work toward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor, who is white, agreed to work on the black leaders&rsquo; agenda, which includes addressing low-performing schools and gaps in educational achievement, job programs for urban areas and assisting minority owned businesses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The governor will speak today at an OLBC luncheon and has agreed to meet quarterly with the black lawmakers to discuss their political agendas.</p>

One can never grovel enough and besides, the damage is done. Kasich is now officially a &#8216;racist&rsquo; so why bother.</p>

<p>His administration is over before it really has much of a chance to begin.  The state legislative black caucus is going to be able to roll this goofball flat as a pancake, and now they know it.</p>
<p><i>The governor, who is white, agreed to work on the black leaders&rsquo; agenda, which includes addressing low-performing schools and gaps in educational achievement, job programs for urban areas and assisting minority owned businesses.</i></p>
<p>Gee, Kasich.  Like nobody has ever thought of that before.  And it&rsquo;s not like anyone has really succeeded after having thought of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad I made no endorsement in OH-GOV.  While I wouldn&rsquo;t have voted for him, the only good thing Ted Strickland did was to try and block the resettlement of some 7,000 Iraqi &#8220;refugees&#8221; into Ohio.</p>

		<p>Why do these guys always unclench their fists and grab their ankles whenever Blacks accuse them of being racists? Why take a tough stance if you are going to punk out? Why attract an audience by standing straight and tall that will still be watching when you bend over?</p>

<p>And just how &#8220;diverse&#8221; is the congressional black caucus??? One gets the feeling that &#8220;diversity&#8221; is just a code word for &#8220;anti white&#8221;.</p>

<p>Meaning he didn&rsquo;t kiss enough black butt and appoint blacks into positions of responsibility for which they are entirely unsuited for. Blacks reveal their intentions by having such a thing as a &#8220;Black Caucus&#8221; in the first place, as has been mentioned, blacks would go ballistic if there was even a suggestion of a &#8220;White Congressional Caucus&#8221; and call such attempts RACISSSSSSSSSS. Maybe iet&rsquo;s time!</p>

<p>Just once it would be nice if some politico would agree to work on a White peoples agenda!</p>
<p>It does not appear this shall ever happen though with the current crop of Conservatives and Republicans.  </p>
<p>They always bow to the Blacks whims however!</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Ohio Legislative <b>Black</b> Caucus&#8221; is a racist organization by its very name.  Yet I don&rsquo;t hear anyone complaining about the percentage of blacks in their makeup.</p>
<p>As an aside, does anyone see a pattern, here?  White man in public position takes a stand against Political Correctness, then shortly afterward recants his heresy with much groveling and abasement?  We&rsquo;ve seen it over and over.</p>
<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist if you will, but it&rsquo;s hard to believe that blacks are really that powerful and organized.  Who is <i>really</i> getting to these uppity Whites?<br/>
