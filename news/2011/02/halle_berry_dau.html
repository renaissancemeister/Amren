<p>Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubry, battling for custody of their daughter Nahla, have both thrown some mud, but after word about Aubry&rsquo;s alleged racism got out, Berry is firing back.</p>
<p>In a new interview with EBONY Magazine, Berry says (via TMZ), &#8220;I feel she&rsquo;s Black. I&rsquo;m Black and I&rsquo;m her mother, and I believe in the one-drop theory.&#8221; </p>
<p>That goes against the wishes of Aubry, who, allegedly, doesn&rsquo;t like when people call Nahla black. {snip}<br>

		<p>Halle Berry is 1/2 White.  The father is 100% White.  That makes the child 3/4 White.  She considers the daughter Black.  It seems this guy Gabriel Aubry hasn&rsquo;t been asked what HE considers his daughter to be.  That in itself is interesting.  Of course if he was asked he might not answer accurately for fear of being labeled &#8220;racist&#8221;.  </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here is simple and most don&rsquo;t recognize it.  There&rsquo;s a great deal of evolutionary psychology going on here, but I believe behavior like Ms. Berry&rsquo;s is an example of -</p>
<p>Genetic theft</p>
<p>This is a pure example of genetic theft.  In other words people unconsciously seek out partners to improve their genetic line - especially Black males.  Since the door has been &#8220;opened&#8221; so-to-speak for Black males to seek out White females, we see more and more Black males seeking out White women, especially White women with Blond hair - the quintessential White woman, the Nordic type White woman.  The door has been opened over the course of the last 45 years or so with the onset of the so-called civil rights movement, the &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221;, the permissiveness of the 1960&rsquo;s, etc.  It can work for the &#8220;Black&#8221; woman too.  A mulatto like Halle Berry has the semi-dark skin of a typical mulatto, and she also possesses talent and good looks, most likely gotten from her White ancestry, if I may come to that conclusion.  Now the offspring of most mixed-race couples consider themselves the race of the non-White parent.  They usually also attribute any positive traits or qualities that they possess to their Black parent.  They do this simply by considering themselves the race of the non-White parent.  So in essence, they steal the White genes so-to-speak from their White parent and then attribute them to their Blackness.  Of course, the end result of all of this if carried to a conclusion will be that there won&rsquo;t be any more White people on earth at some distant point in time and all the semi-dark peoples who have appropriated our genes over time will claim all our qualities giving The White man no credit at all and eventually claiming credit for all that White have accomplished since time immemorial.  We see this beginning already.  We are beginning to see Blacks depicting Whites in movies.  We see Blacks already being given credit for inventions and accomplishments of Whites.  If it&rsquo;s this way now, and these trends are allowed to continue unabated, they will only increase.  The first thing that we can do is realize what&rsquo;s happening by being honest with ourselves and communicating what we observe to other racially-conscious White people, and they in turn communicate with others.  We have to also understand that there is an active agenda being promoted FOR our race to inter-breed with non-Whites as a strategy for our eventual extinction.</p>

		<p>I feel sorry for Halle Berry.  She&rsquo;s beautiful (looks just like her white English mother), is talented and probably quite intelligent.  But she clearly has mental issues, probably relating to the fact that, based on her own life history, she knows how violent and irresponsible black men tend to be.  Yet, she has to acknowledge her own racial makeup, and apparently has very strong mixed feelings about that. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard mulattos refer to themselves proudly as &#8216;Obama black&rsquo;. This child will probably take comfort in that.</p>

		<p>If Halle Berry were to give her family tree a good shaking, her few Black ancestors would be smothered under a pile of her embarrassed White ancestors. </p>
<p>I do, however, agree with her about the &#8220;One Drop Theory&#8221;. That theory is analogous to blending a tiny piece of feces  into a gallon of ice cream. It&rsquo;s still 99.999% ice cream, but it&rsquo;s 100% contaminated. </p>

		<p>I wonder what elements of proof are needed to access all manner of affirmative action goodies. Despite my Nordic ancestry and blond blue-eyed appearance, there could be some tiny remnant of black African blood in the old gene pool, which could have briefly dipped to low tide at some point in the distant past. </p>

		<p>And Halle&rsquo;s Mother is white, therefore, Halle is what? Seems to me that would make Halle racially mixed, as well as her daughter. Ironically, she has tried to make her ex seem racist, because he did not want to hear his daughter called black, but I think he only felt that way, because it sounded like her way of denying him as a parent. Halle strikes me as a hypocrite, considering it was her white mother that raised her.</p>

		<p>For those of you who want to make this an argument against interracial marriage and miscegenation (for the record,I do not approve of it), the back and forth between these two psychopaths will not help us advance our case. </p>
<p>This is nothing but a cheap publicity ploy by both camps (Berry&rsquo;s and Aubry&rsquo;s) to gain custody of a little girl. This is no different than millions of other custody cases between average people or celebrities. </p>
<p>In fact, I do not beleive half the &#8220;information&#8221; that is being printed.</p>

		<p>Actually, according to TMZ and the Associated Press, Mr. Aubry was physically abusive to Ms.Berry. He apparently, allegedly  slapped her around several times.</p>
<p>If this is true, this definitely disqualifies him as a suitable person for custody of the child.</p>

		<p>Well, after Barack Obama was declared &#8220;Black&#8221; the dirty little secret is out. Blacks have their own version of the Jim Crow &#8220;one drop&#8221; rule. Of course this only works for someone that has achieved some fame and power. If the black person in question is a criminal or somehow brought disgrace to themselves then blacks don&rsquo;t waste anytime reminding anyone who will listen that there is some &#8220;whiteness&#8221; in the family tree. As for Halle Barry is just shows what lengths blacks will go to play the race card even against their spouses. If you follow her logic, Barack Obama should be white because his mother was white.</p>

		<p>Actually, I do not agree with employing the &#8220;one-drop&#8221; rule in such situations, but for very different reasons than Miss Berry. The child ISN&rsquo;T Black, anymore than the child is White! The child, like Berry herself is mullato, mixed-race. I take issue with it, because mulattos like Berry, President Obama, singer Beyonce Knowles, etc., would almost certainly NOT be in the positions of power, wealth and fame they are, were it not for their White genes! Calling them simply &#8220;Black&#8221; inadvertently bestows far too much credit upon full Blacks in general. Whether we wish their White DNA to be there or not, it is still there and thus, shouldn&rsquo;t be written off - at least from the purely scientific standpoint.  </p>
<p>That said(as already noted above), they are most certainly not White either, and should never be considered such on any level. </p>
<p>Mixed-race is mixed-race&hellip;a mongrel, a mutt, what have you. </p>

		<p>If Aubry doesn&rsquo;t like it when people call Nahla black, he should have thought of that before he had a child with a black woman. The trouble is that anybody who tries to warn people of the problems which come with interracial marriage is shouted down with all sorts of insults. If the truth about miscegenation was the predominating view, this man might have married a white woman and had white children. Interracial marriage should be illegal.  </p>

		<p>Halle Berry amazes me to no end.  She is half white and half black but she considers herself black which is fine with me.  If you took away her white genetic makeup, she would have no beauty at all, no career, etc.  Simple math states her daughter is one quarter black so her daughter will have an easier life since she will look more white.  Why exactly does Berry identify herself as black when clearly it is her white side which has given all of her opportunity.  Talk about self hating.</p>

		<p>Years ago, people of African heritage hated the word &#8220;black&#8221; because they put great stock in having European ancestry and lighter skin.  But now the group has stuck itself with the word, and of course it DOES denote even one drop.  Many Americans who are identified, both by self and community, as white have a drop or a dram of Native American blood.  If they wish, these people can call themselves Indian or a member of a specific tribe (though the latter may not legally accept them as such).  <br>
Now, with Obama&rsquo;s election, the term &#8220;mulatto&#8221; has come back into common usage.  I personally have always preferred the word &#8220;colored&#8221; to refer to people who are African/European hybrids, but of course that term is deemed to be racist now.<br>
Nonelessless, whites around the world are becoming sick and tired of being subjected to attempted manipulation by darker-skinned racists who live to jerk whitey&rsquo;s chain.</p>

		<p>What I find ironic about Halle Berry is that in the majority of her films she is portrayed as sexual prey for the white men in the cast. Watch her movies which include Swordfish, X-Men, Executive Decision, Bullworth, Die Another Day, and let&rsquo;s not forget my personal favorite: Monster&rsquo;s Ball. </p>

		<p>I had a good friend that was mixed her mother was blonde haired blue eyed white as can be, her father black as coal and of course absent. She went to university joined a Black Sorority and was treated like dirt for being pretty and looking hispanic. She dated only black athletes they cheated on her and treated her like dirt. After university she came around to the fact most blacks wanted nothing to do with her. I believe this was do to jealousy. </p>
<p>My point is this Halle Barry is an opportunist she is black when it suits her. She lives in a wealthy White world and does not mix with average blacks. In Ebony magazine she is black, to gain custody she is black, her address lilly white.</p>

		<p> This whole incident is indicative of the decline of white civilization in American. In the Deep South, blacks, particularly women, were always proud of having lighter skin:  being of &ldquo;mellow&rdquo; or &#8220;yellow&#8221; complexion. On occasion, I&rsquo;ve even heard blacks muse wistfully over a lighter relative who married a darker black and let &mdash; &ldquo;all that yellow go to waste.&#8221;  During past centuries many prominent mixed race blacks (i.e. Jelly Roll Morton) didn&rsquo;t want to be considered black but Creole. Many had as their goal to mix enough to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; into white society and escape the &#8220;curse&#8221; of blackness. Now blacks are celebrated victims who are owed deference from society for &ldquo;racism and the legacy of slavery.&rdquo;  No famous blacks want to &#8220;pass&#8221; for white today; in fact, they frequently won&rsquo;t even acknowledge any positive aspects of their own white heritage. </p>

		<p>This controversy was a good test for me, on whether or not I&rsquo;ve truly been ignoring the MSM.  I swore off fashion magazines a few years back, when they got preachy and moralistic (and you know what &#8216;morality&rsquo;&hellip;Diversity&hellip;they were pushing&hellip;).</p>
<p>The &#8216;fashion&rsquo; shoots, anyway had seemed to have devolved into photo essays themed along the lines of &#8216;privileged teens, staggering, stoned on drugs, through the shrubbery of Southampton&rsquo; or &#8216;privileged teens, lying, semiconscious and stoned on drugs, in the gutters of Manhattan&rsquo;s trendier slums&rsquo;.  Sometimes, we were treated to &#8216;privileged teens, in the throes of glorious Interracial Love, while stoned on drugs and semi-clad in the latest fashions&rsquo;.  Much attitude: little information.  So, I just go into Maison Weiss, these days, and let them dress me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had never seen or heard of Gabriel Aubry.  I would have noticed him: first the enviable hair, and then the amazing fact that a man with hips as big and ugly as a woman&rsquo;s could be a Top Model.  THE Top Model, apparently.  I thought only narrow-hipped peasants got to be male models.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never heard of the man whom the Fashion Industry has named &#8220;The 2nd Male Model Icon of All Time&#8221;.  I just called a few of my Chums, and none of those women had ever heard of him, either (or recognized his photo, after a Google search).  We are women who buy the top labels.  And the MSM is not reaching us, anymore.  Big media is making itself irrelevant.</p>
<p>Aubry is not one of those German models with doctorates in Quantum Mechanics.  He was a cook, and his &#8216;accomplishments&rsquo; include playing the Guitar, and playing Golf.  He made it big in modeling because he &#8220;has that masculine, manly, look the Fashion Industry is looking for&#8221; and because he &#8220;has that androgynous, boyish, look the Fashion Industry is looking for&#8221;.  Yeah.  Quick research reveals he&rsquo;s from one of those giant Quebecois families (the kind, apparently, who, through fecundity and immigration, have come to form Maine&rsquo;s Underclass) and grew up in Foster Care (until he &#8216;made it big&rsquo;, and his Dad &#8216;rediscovered&rsquo; him). </p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m going with this is that Posterity will not suffer unduly, if Mr. Aubry&rsquo;s Pretty Hair Genes have hit a dead end.</p>
<p>Apparently, contact with Miss Berry has created another Race Realist in Mr. Aubry (to whatever degree he is able to conceptualize).  And this points out the dilemma with which so many people in similar positions are faced.  He&rsquo;s a Race Realist now, but he&rsquo;s got a mixed-race kid.</p>
<p>Does he join the &#8216;Realist Team&rsquo;?  Or does he force himself back into denial, out of love and loyalty to his child?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hate to be in Mr. Aubry&rsquo;s position, right now.</p>

Halle Berry amazes me to no end. She is half white and half black but she considers herself black which is fine with me. If you took away her white genetic makeup, she would have no beauty at all, no career, etc. Simple math states her daughter is one quarter black so her daughter will have an easier life since she will look more white. Why exactly does Berry identify herself as black when clearly it is her white side which has given all of her opportunity. Talk about self hating</p>

		<p>To Eduard post #17:</p>
<p>The &#8220;one drop rule&#8221; is simple; it proposes that anyone with a single drop of black blood in their ancestry is considered to be black.  In the Old South, a baby born to a black slave woman was automatically considered a slave regardless that the father may have been white or that the mother might not have been pure black.</p>
<p>A child with one white and one black parent was called a mulatto.  If that mulatto bred with a white, its child was called a quadroon.  And if that quadroon interbred with a white, it&rsquo;s child was called an octaroon.</p>
<p>Any amount of black blood (&#8220;one drop&#8221;) was enough that the individual was considered &#8220;colored,&#8221; and inferior to pure whites.  Obviously, there was much confusion and fraud.  A person of thinly mixed blood might pass for an un-tainted white and escape the suspicions of society.</p>
<p>Also, many if not most of the &#8220;black&#8221; geniuses portrayed during Black History Month were at least part white, and this is confirmed in photographs of them.      </p>

		<p>Pretty hard to tell if the child could be considered black. But I don&rsquo;t think she could be considered white either by the looks of her. I certainly wish people would think more of the results of their lust. Ultimately, this child will be hurt because of her parents behavior. Too bad.</p>

		<p>Berry probably declared the child is black so that it will benefit from a lifetime of aff-action preferences. The White side of the child will ensure that in a roomful of blacks, she will be among the smartest. In a roomfull of Whites however, she would languish with the blacks at the low end of the achievement scale. And so it goes&hellip; </p>

<p>She was raised by her white mother after being abandoned by her black father (there&rsquo;s a shock) and she had a big time nose job to make herself look whiter.</p>

<p>I would agree with that.  But whatever race she eventually identifies with, she&rsquo;ll be as confused as Obama was in determining who he was.  It results in considerable turmoil to mixed race people who wind up confused and angry and not belonging anywhere, nor fitting in anywhere.  </p>

So far everything has been he-said she-said, with a lot more she-said going on so far. And so far it seems Halle has relied on hints and implications, mostly be suggesting he is racist and perhaps an abusive parent, because she said her daughter cries when he sees her. But I am sure had he truly hit Halle, she would say so outright before the press. After all she has given numerous other interviews talking about all her physically abusive black ex&rsquo;s</p>

		<p>Halle gave interviews a few years back, saying she was eager to have a child, and being that she was over-40, she indicated, she would gladly have one out of wedlock. In one interview with Oprah, she talked about a white, gay male designer, that Oprah often featured on her show, saying how nice, and great looking he was, and what a beautiful child she could produce with him. She has also given interviews saying how she saw Gabriel Aubrey at a party, and found him so good looking she aggressively pursued him. Given all that it seems obvious she wanted a good looking white man to father her child, obviously to ensure she produced a beautiful child. Now that the deed is done, she wants to deny her child&rsquo;s white DNA. </p>

		<p>A while back the son of a friend of my mother had a kid by a woman that is half black and half white. The child they produced had white skin and blond hair and blue eyes. The kid was completely white and could pass for no other race than white. You would have never known that it was a quarter black by looking at it. </p>
<p>This raised a question in my mind in terms of how and why this kid was so much white if black genes are dominent over white genes? I mean the mother almost looks full blooded black and if you did not know it was her kid then you would think that she kidnapped a white child from its parents.</p>
<p>Another thing that is on my mind is what long term affects will all of the interbreeding between black males and white females have on the black women. It seems to me that white males are not flocking to black women in the same mass droves as their female conter parts. Also, I read that black females have more estrogen in their body. It seems to me that the biological clock of the black females is always in over drive and it seems like there is a good possibility that she could be abandoned by all males as a sexual partner, so what does this mean for the black female in the long term? I would wager that massive sexual frustration is very common among black women and hence the chip on their shoulder towards white people.</p>
<p>There is no denying that white males do intermarry with black women, but it just seems like it is not as common, and will never be as common as the interacial dating among whites and other races. Statistics have already shown that black females are less likely to be raped by white males than the other way around. Does this indicate that black females are not looked upon attactive enough to even force yourself upon them?</p>
<p>To answer my own question, I see black women becoming simultaneously bitter towards the black male, and in some sense society as a whole, for betraying them to white women. Secondly, I see them becoming increasingly sexually submissive to white males in an attempt to try and aquire their seeed. This is already going on, and as a white male myself I have noticed that black women hit on me in far greater numbers then other non-white females and even white women in general. However, I do not find black women attractive not so much for their appearance as their attitude. Most black females are just too damn rude, mean, over bearing and impulsive (and ugly) to date. </p>
<p>On a personal note, I dated a half-Mexican and half-white woman and when I first met her I though she was caucasian because her skin was very light and she had, believe it or not, green eyes. She was very attractive and when I found out that she was mixed I was astonished simply because she had white features.  </p>

<p>Actually, they never married. Halle Berry said after last marriage she never planned to marry again. Obviously, their daughter is &#8220;part&#8221; black, I doubt Aubrey would have a problem with it if she termed it like that. Basically, she is saying she is black like me, not white like you, to diminish his connection with his daughter. Also, by sending him an email saying, &#8220;You were good for only one thing, Thanks for the donation&#8221; It&rsquo;s obvious in her eyes, the relationship was only about sex, and having someone sire her child, and she selected a white male model with chiseled features to donate his DNA, Mission accomplished! Now she wants them out of their lives. Perhaps she should have considered a sperm bank, but then she might not have been able to get such a perfect physical specimen</p>

<p>  Jessica Alba is a good example of a half Mexican woman who looks almost completely white. Obviously, her father was not an Indio or Mestizo, but had more Spanish ancestry. She&rsquo;s an attractive woman, much more attractive than Ms. Berry.</p>
