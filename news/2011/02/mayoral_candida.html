<h1>Mayoral Candidates Go After Emanuel on Taxes, Slavery Reparations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Chase, Chicago Tribune, February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rahm Emanuel found himself criticized on issues ranging from taxes to reparations for slavery Wednesday night during the first forum featuring all six candidates for Chicago mayor.</p>
<p>The former White House chief of staff mostly ignored the barbs, especially those from Gery Chico, former Chicago school board president. He contended that Emanuel would burden taxpayers with a service tax Emanuel has proposed as part of a plan that would include a quarter-point cut in the city sales tax.</p>
<p>Two other candidates, William &#8220;Dock&#8221; Walls and Patricia Van Pelt-Watkins, slammed Emanuel for his positions on tax increment financing districts and reparations.</p>
<p>Emanuel agreed with most candidates in supporting reparations for descendants of slavery, but said that all citizens need to keep in mind that the city has a significant budget deficit to tackle.</p>
<p>Watkins, a community activist and one of three African-American candidates, said she was offended by Emanuel&rsquo;s comments because the nation was built &#8220;on the backs&#8221; of slaves.</p>

		<p>How much more does my state have to give!? When it comes to reparations for slavery, Rahm will not get many, if not all white supporters to cast out their vote for him. </p>
<p>The news media, newspapers seem to only say or mention his name, but not ANY other mayoral candidate. Once again the possessed and manipulating media are sucking up once again for the minorities. Believe me, if you live in Chicago, or anywhere in Illinois, or just maybe parts of Indiana (Hammond, Gary, Merrillville) you have not heard of the other mayoral candidates except for Rahm Emanuel&hellip;</p>
<p>At least I have not anyways!</p>

		<p>Correct me if i am wrong,  but Chicago never had any slavery and was built on the hard work of White settlers. Blacks were then attracted to live their by the city created by the Whites and by the jobs created by the Whites.</p>
<p>And now they want those same Whites to &#8216;compensate&rsquo; them&hellip;..</p>

		<p>None of the above.  I don&rsquo;t even trust Chico   &mdash;   While the city&rsquo;s cop union endorses him, Chico unfortunately also has the endorsement of Congressman Luis Gutierrez, and a lot of Chicago&rsquo;s Hispanic rabble rousing hate groups.  I&rsquo;m against slavery reparations, for sure, but this is a red herring issue, mainly as a last minute hail mary to try and derail Rahm, who is at over 50% in all the polls, with the election on Feb. 22.  If Rahm gets over 50 then, he&rsquo;s in. </p>
<p>Chicago never had slavery.  In fact, it was (and to an extent, still is) where a lot of blacks want to be, some sort of talisman land of milk and honey.  Chicago&rsquo;s very existence and its welcoming attitude toward blacks is the main reason why MS is still majority white to this day.</p>
<p>Another delicious irony is that Rahm&rsquo;s former boss, in his race for the U.S. Senate from IL in 2004, came out against reparations while his conservative so-called black opponent, trucked in from Maryland, came out for them in a sense.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s one of those little canards &#8220;community activists&#8221; like to throw out to justify their agendas. Slavery, like illegal immigration, is an attack on the working class. It creates unemployment and drives down wages by creating an artificial oversupply of labor. The people who benefit from slavery and illegal labor are business owners as well as the slaves and illegals themselves! Working class Americans are the ones who are harmed.</p>

		<p>One factor in Rahm&rsquo;s former boss Obama winning his Senate seat in 2004 was his opposition to reparation- fooling some into thinking he was a moderate- while his &#8220;conservative&#8221; black Republican opponent Alan Keyes supported them. </p>

		<p>Another thing, who bets this whole &#8220;Blacks deserve slavery reparations&#8221; gimmick that minority mayoral candidates can use&hellip;will one day soon be a trend or other candidates in the time to come? </p>
<p>Imagine the next Detroit mayoral candidate wanting to favor slavery reparations, blacks will literally lower a bridge over a moat to welcome that kind of guy into their city!</p>
<p>And Watkins&rsquo; comment about &#8220;Built on the backs of slaves&#8221;!? Funny&hellip;I don&rsquo;t recall cities like NYC, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles ever being built by slaves. Has there been anything that &#8220;slaves backs&#8221; actually built that could be considered &#8220;The reason our nation was built&#8221;? </p>
<p>If this Emanuel gets elected we&rsquo;re in serious trouble, and debt&hellip;well, maybe Illinois will be.</p>

		<p>Chicago&rsquo;s mayorial candidates are in favor of reparations to be paid by the CITY OF CHICAGO to the distant descendents of African-American slaves? I could see someone making a (very weak) argument for such reparations from the federal government, the state of South Carolina, or the city of Atlanta, but from the city of Chicago??? I would be no more surprised if the mayorial candidates came out in favor of Chicago starting its own space exploration program or navy.</p>

		<p>Illinois was a slave state to the extent that it was allowed on a county-option basis.  Only five of its counties allowed slavery.</p>
<p>That said, it has always been my understanding that it was the Swedes that built Chicago.  They get the credit.  I get this opinion from reading of Chicago history online, using official Chicago websites.</p>

		<p>This country was built on the backs of SLAVES?  Oh, really?  Blacks don&rsquo;t even make up 20% of the population today, and it was much less back when slavery was practiced.  The deep South was where the slaves did the backbreaking work; it wasn&rsquo;t in the north, or the West - the people who were to form West Virginia didn&rsquo;t even own slaves, and were loyal to the Union.  Blacks made contributions in the West, but as free men, not slaves, and ditto in the North.  No person alive today was ever a slave, and we don&rsquo;t pay reparations for dead people.  Get real, Chicago idiots!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;the nation was built &ldquo;on the backs&rdquo; of slaves.&#8221;: Reparations for Slavery will be a never ending cause for many Blacks.  Even if given vast amounts of money or other types of wealth, it will never be enough as succeding generations of Blacks will forever claim poverty or mistreatment by Whites. As aggravating as it might be for Southern Whites, I would suggest America give Blacks their own Nation, centered on the historical &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; throughout the Southeastern U.S.  The deal would be that they have their own Nation, but that ALL Blacks in the U.S. would have to move there, and stay there. They could take whatever White partners or mixed-race offspring they have with them. Additionally, reparations for Slavery is then to be seen as paid in full.  Otherwise, if we truly see an all-White ethno-State in our future, then what we are saying is that the United States is a failed Nation.  With that, the Black Nationalists and LaRaza/MECHA types who each want their own nation as well, actually become our allies in the cause.  I see two primary questions to answer: The first being not if or when we separate, but where (border lines) the separation takes place, and secondly, do we agree to break apart peacefully or drag it out and break up only after extreme ethno-centric violence and destruction of property?</p>

		<p>200 years ago my great, great, great, grandfather had his foot run over by a neighbors wagon. The neighbor was drunk, and my relative had to have his leg amputated.<br>
This ius tearing me up&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t sleep or eat, only enough to stay alive I MUST GET SOME FORM OF REPARATIONS for what happened.</p>
<p>1. How do I find the relatives of the man who did this, Today?<br>
2. How long will I have to wait for my check from the government once I find them?<br>
3. I am out looking at new Mercedes today, so I hope I collect my REPARATIONS fast.</p>

		<p>To Poster Number Two:</p>
<p>YES you are correct in what you are saying.<br>
1. There were never any slaves in Chicago.<br>
2. blacks came to Chicago to take advantage of the prosperity Whites had created in the city.<br>
3. This is pretty much the same system blacks use today, wait for others to build something of value, then DEMAND to be included, unless you are a racist that is..</p>

		<p>I say we give them their asked for reparations for slavery.  But we link it to a bill (call it reparations to communities resulting from free blacks) for the destruction they cause communities, the violence and crimes they commit TODAY, for the vast billions we&rsquo;ve spent on welfare etc, and all the free lunches in schools, and for all the social services they&rsquo;ve demanded and depended on.  Total it all up.  Do the accounting, and then send them a BILL for the diff between slave reparations and what it costs communities to have them in their midst as free peoples.  </p>

		<p>When the Hispanic population reaches 40% in the US it will be the result of decades of progressive growth and an entrepreneurial talent that few blacks have.  A large portion of those Hispanics will be middle class and a substantial number will be in the upper middle class and taking over substantial swaths of political territory.  NONE of them will vote for slavery reparations.  <br>
 <br>
But then, I don&rsquo;t expect it to come to an actual vote.  I expect it to be snuck in under the rug just like this recent black farmer fiasco.  The issue is introduced every single year by some &#8220;progressive&#8221; black while the rest of the year is spent trying to sneak parts of it in the back door.  Literally!<br>

		<p>What makes this really absurd is that most white Chicagoans are descended from late-19th and early-20th century European immigrants who came here to work in factories. These people make up most of the taxpayers and their ancestors hold zero responsibility for slavery.</p>

		<p>RUNING FOR MAYOR OF CHICAGO talking about Chicago Budget Issues and she wants CHICAGO TAX PAYERS TO PAY REPERATIONS, dose she forget not everyone in this world was a racist and many whites in the north fought and died for the ABOLISHMENT OF SLAVERY and CHICAGO was a city of Refuge for Slaves who made there way North. I looking looking at this character a lil closer, LOOK AT <a href="http://www.wbez.org/story/joseph-stanford/biggest-donor-mayors-race-explains-gift" rel="nofollow">http://www.wbez.org/story/joseph-stanford/biggest-donor-mayors-race-explains-gift</a> <br>
Seems over 60% of funds raised for her campaign comes from her pastor. Must be some major money here, making it off community funded projects with Watkins, Joseph Stanford construction company which is called AMFORCH construction. I believe to be an &#8220;acronym&#8221; for &#8220;Ambassadors for Christ Church&#8221;, Where Watkins is the Treasurer for both and then Watkins serves as the Director of Target Area Development. Just like this campaign looks as he contributes, she gives it back, $3500 reported one time consultation fee paid by Watkins to Stanford. I think this community development corp is nothing but the same out of Watkins hands into her Pastors pockets and back and forth again. <a href="http://www.housingdeveloper.com/consulting_clientlist_f.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.housingdeveloper.com/consulting_clientlist_f.html</a> <br>
Watkins is CEO of this Sheba Development Corp also, Stanford Founder of Ambassadors for Christ, Watkins his Treasurer/co minister there too. These two are so intertwined its crazy .Watkins church &#8220;AFC&#8221; is a rental facility: <a href="http://www.impactnetwork.net/crusaders.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.impactnetwork.net/crusaders.html</a> <br>
Crusaders is one of numerous church&rsquo;s who rents from AFC Outreach Center. AFC &#8220;acronym&#8221; Ambassadors for Christ a Watkins/Stanford $ organization. Is Rent Collected on this property Tax Exempt? Quite a tightly woven pair to the point Watkins is reported to live in the same residence. http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/3657336-418/paid-income-chico-taxes-2009.html <br>
Watkins has donated more than half of her adjusted gross income to charity. She did not provide documents to show where those contributions went and declined to answer questions about them. She also declined to discuss her relationship with Stanford. Van-Pelt Watkins: St. Joseph County Michigan, Van-Pelt or Watkins, Stanford, Ambassadors for Christ dating back to the 90&rsquo;s has numerous properties here one in Van-Pelt or Watkins name, two Stanford&rsquo;s and several in Ambassadors for Christ. A church in south bend which seems to have no members and is never open just a parking lot at the church spaces rented out. http://www.south-bend-today.com/ambassadors-for-christ-church/<br>
REPARATIONS? Looks like these two is doing fine using tax exempt/non for profit businesses. Stanford and Watkins operations seem to be going international too with the Target business <a href="http://targetarea.org/regional/atlantis-south-africa/" rel="nofollow">http://targetarea.org/regional/atlantis-south-africa/</a><br>
Watkins is obviously a quite intelligent individual too bad she seems quite off base on several things like Reparations and most likely she has racial attitudes, she obviously has made this pastor quite influential and wealthy. This will be an interesting one to follow.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t blaming and asking for compensation from a whole group of people, based upon what individuals from that said group have done in the past racist?</p>
<p>I find giving reprimands for &#8220;descendants&#8221; of slaves ludicrous. The actual slaves and the families, yes. But descendants from 150-200 years ago? Oh the agony! These black people must go through terrible pain although there is no DIRECT PHYSICAL INJURY  &mdash;  the nightmares that some evil white man from 200 years ago is inflicting upon them as a group! For people who don&rsquo;t like racism and value individualism they sure love to put themselves that racial group called &#8220;the black community.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know not all black people think this way, but this is sad. Doesn&rsquo;t the same group say &#8220;This is 2011. Why do we still have racism?&#8221; Yeah, I want to know why.</p>
<p>And no, the nation was not built by slaves.</p>

		<p>YES, you read this right, I say YES to REPARATIONS.</p>
<p>We have not done enough for blacks yet.</p>
<p>Some people might say decades of WELFARE is a form of REPARATIONS</p>
<p>Some people might say Affirmative Action to those undeserving is a form of REPARATIONS.</p>
<p>Now here is MY question is ONLY this generation of blacks entitled to REPARATIONS? What about their children to come?<br>
What about Grandpa Willie who passed away two years ago, who gets what he had due?</p>
<p>I say give each black a Debit Card and let them use it as they please, new care (use debit card) new house (use debit card) and so on, this way each black could take as much as they thought due from The Evil White Devil who has been so mean to them.</p>
<p>Off Topic:<br>
But what is going on with all these black males with white females commercials Micky D, Pepsi, Hallmark, maybe whites should quit interfering with what these great companies are trying to do for blacks and let the blacks they seem to crave so much be the Only Ones Buying Their Products?<br>
The protest MUST start somewhere..</p>

		<p>The purpose of reparations is to make a victim whole, to put him back in the position where he&rsquo;d be had the wrong never been carried out in the first place.  Had there never been slavery nearly every black person in the New World would be living in West Africa somewhere.  So here is my proposal:</p>
<p>To any black American willing to forgo his citizenship, and can find an African country willing to let him immigrate on a permanent basis, free airfare to that country plus $23,000* to get him started.  He can also sell off any property he has and take the cash with him, tax free.  If he comes back he gets jailed as an illegal immigrant and then deported.</p>
<p>* This is 10 times the per capita income of Nigeria.<br>

		<p>I heard Bill Cosby the entertainer say this more than one time.</p>
<p>Everyday I get down on my knees and thank God that my distant relatives were slaves. Now I am not saying they weren&rsquo;t mistreated what I am saying is blacks in Africa that were not sold as slaves by the sellers (enemy black tribes) were murdered by their captors. Bill said if my ancestors had not been slave my guess is I would have never been born. <br>
I think this is pretty good thinking myself but I know the NAACP was very upset with Mr Cosby&rsquo;s comments.<br>
Maybe that is why he has been so successful? He doesn&rsquo;t whine and cry he seizes opportunity and uses it to his advantage..</p>

		<p>Today&rsquo;s historians make one glaring error which seems to be endemic to today&rsquo;s &#8220;educated&#8221; people.<br>
Today&rsquo;s historians judge behavior of those who lived years and centuries ago by today&rsquo;s standards.  One cannot realize the objectivity of those who lived long ago by utilizing the norms of today.<br>
Yes, slavery was cruel.  White slaves (yes, there were many  &mdash;  known as &#8220;indentured servants&#8221;) were most often treated more cruelly than the black slaves.  Black slaves were seen as a valuable &#8220;investment&#8221;, to be cared for so as to protect the owner&rsquo;s financial interest.  Add to that the Christian concept which seemed to (mistakenly) justify (black) slavery by extolling the virtue of taking the savage away from the jungle and grounding him in the &#8220;enlightened&#8221; concepts of Christianity.<br>
One cannot judge the actions of those who have gone before us by today&rsquo;s standards.  </p>
