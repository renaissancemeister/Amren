	<p>Intelligence: Brahms on the Brain</p>
<p>If brought back to life, early humans might grasp &#8220;American Idol,&#8221; but they&rsquo;d be stumped by a Brahms symphony. According to one theory, music began, evolutionarily speaking, with expressive vocalization, and instrumental music (and bigger brains) arrived much later.</p>
<p>After statistically correcting for socioeconomic factors, researchers found that higher IQ did predict a preference for instrumental over vocal music.</p>
<p>To test out a correlation between intelligence and preferring the nonvocal classics, researchers drew on the 1993 edition of the General Social Survey, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center. The 1,600 participants were asked to rate their enjoyment of 18 musical genres on a 1-to-5 scale. Half also took a vocabulary test, converted to an IQ score.</p>
<p>After statistically correcting for socioeconomic factors, the researchers found that higher IQ did, indeed, predict a preference for instrumental over vocal music. The researcher&rsquo;s &#8220;instrumental&#8221; genres were classical, big band and easy listening. Those who liked classical music a lot had an average IQ of 107; those who hated it scored 93. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of information that is well known among those who use such things to our advantage&hellip;.but you will be hard pressed to find it researched.</p>
<p>Classical music CAUSES an increase in IQ.  It does so because that is one of the reasons why people create music in the first place.  Music creates altered states&hellip;.like focus.  It changes brain wave patterns and, over time, due to neural plasticity (look up what that is), our brains change in order to make it easier.  One way to define intelligence is the ease by which one enters into such focused states of awareness in order to &#8220;see&#8221; patterns which are not obvious and complete or extend them to find solutions to problems.</p>
<p>And todays music does the opposite.  Why?  By design.  Those who seek to control listen to classical music&hellip;.and create Lady Gaga for everyone else to listen to.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot of smarts to comprehend a single melody line, such as that which you find in any song sung by a solo performer.  It takes a whole lot more intelligence to appreciate both the horizontal (melodic) AND vertical (harmonic) dimensions in music, and that&rsquo;s what you find in a symphony, concerto, string quartet, jazz ensemble, or choral music.  Add any type of percussion dimension and it becomes even more complex.  This is why lower intelligences like rap hiphop music (no melody and a single repetitive percussive element), and higher intelligences can appreciate Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussey, and Webern, etc. - (multiple horizontal and vertical elements).  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing what sort of &#8220;statistical correcting&#8221; was done on the data.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that &#8220;instrumental&#8221; versus &#8220;vocal&#8221; is a valid distinction.  I like opera, which is just about as vocal as it gets.  Would that, in this study, indicate that I don&rsquo;t like classical music?  A lot of loose ends here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though the researchers seem to be very careful not to mention the race of the subjects, I would not be surprised to discover that Quantavius and Shaneeka don&rsquo;t spent much time listening to Katachturian on their boom boxes, or boogieing along to Wagner operas.</p>

		<p>No, no, no.  The article has it all wrong.  It&rsquo;s white priviledge combined with the inherent racism of classical music lovers that keeps certain people out of the room.</p>
<p>Instrumental music could diversify by allowing in African rhythmns, some salsa refrains - maybe a few &#8216;scratch mixes&rsquo; or an odd &#8216;Word Up!&rsquo; whispered in between melodies.  Then the genre would attract the high IQ blacks and latinos.</p>
<p>Of course Asians, who come from an old civilization with thousands of years of instrumntals, are happy with western classical music as is given that it mirros so much of what they have already, but then again, Africa and Latin America have more vibrant expressions than Brahms or any other culture could hope to match.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Al Sharpton on this?  We need some diversity here!</p>

		<p>Interesting.  My IQ in HS tested at 137.  I have always thought that classical music sounds absolutely beautiful but I could never sit and listen to it. I like easy listening and big band music as well but, other than while driving, I have never been able to listen to music for long periods of time.  Rap, hip-hop and heavy metal make me ill and would definitely chase me out of any establishment that played that trash.  I wonder where that puts me?<br>

		<p>Seems doubtful to me. While I like (western)&#8221;Classical&#8221; music (and Baroque,Renaissance, Romantic, Opera, etc.), I grew up in the deep south listening to country (Grand Ole Opry), dixieland, rhythm and blues (WLAC, Nashville Tennessee) and a smattering of &#8220;Classical&#8221; through presentations at my local high school. Jazz and Chamber Music came later.</p>
<p>Chamber Music, for me, was an acquired taste. As an adult I listened to various &#8220;small&#8221; performances, but none ever connected. That is, until I heard Smetana&rsquo;s Piano Trio in G minor, written in tribute to a daughter who died at age four. </p>
<p>My laptop computer sits on top of a tape deck, and I sometimes listen to music while I read on the internet. Earlier today I listened to &#8220;The Best of B.B. King&#8221; (includes &#8220;Why I Sing the Blues&#8221; and when I clicked on this article I was listening to an obscure tape which I found at the &#8220;free store&#8221; at our local dump - Cello Encores, by Ofra Harnoy, Cello, and William Aide, Piano.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a musician, just an old guy who happens to like music and was exposed to many kinds over the years.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Clearing out the riff raff&#8221; is true only in a general &#8216;playing<br>
the odds&#8221; rule of thumb.  While almost no subnormal IQ relates<br>
to finer music patterns and the attention and memory demanded<br>
for such, a lot of flat normal-range  people genuinely cotton to<br>
classical music and a troubling number of bright (often <br>
unemotional or emotionally disorded ) people relate mainly, often<br>
exclusively, to the Nashville product.   As a &#8220;compass&#8221; to IQ,<br>
this matter is hedged about with as many ifs and buts and exceptions as a third-rate stock market advice sheet.     </p>

		<p>No surprises here. I have long said that pop/rap/hip-hop music, for instance, is the very soundtrack of low-intelligence - it actually sounds stupid in composition and execution! Listening to Brahms or Schumann, however, gives me the exact opposite impression. I understood this long before I was altogether racially aware.   </p>

<p>Most music that involves vocals tends to repeat itself over and over again. I remember a popular disco song from the 70&rsquo;s where the only word in the entire song was &#8220;dance&#8221; and it was repeated over, and over, and over, and over, and over&hellip;again.</p>
<p>Originally vocal music was used as a learning tool and to memorize important things because most people didn&rsquo;t know how to write or have paper to write things down.</p>
<p>Now most music is centered between to genre: Complaining and bragging. Poor me (country), look at me (hiphop/rock), or a combination of both (rap-i&rsquo;m poor and black/look at all my ho&rsquo;s).</p>

<p><br>
Not surprisingly, the ONLY race other than Eurowhites who have EVER taken to classical music   &mdash;   both listening to it and performing it*   &mdash;   are East Asians. The only racial groups who like classical are also the only groups whose median IQ reaches into the triple digits. </p>
<p>BTW, the subway stations in my area pipe in light classical through their PA systems. I have wondered, when walking through a station infested with crowds of loitering black yoofs, how long it will be before some &#8220;Community Disorganizer&#8221; decides that string quartets are &#8220;elitist&#8221; and therefore &#8220;racist&#8221;; and demands that music on the public-transit system be made more &#8220;inclusive&#8221;&hellip; which will mean, of course, inclusive of gangsta rap, salsa, reggaeton, and other modern nonwhite sonic pathologies.  </p>
<p><br>
* Although not, significantly, COMPOSING it. Asians may perform difficult classical pieces superbly   &mdash;   but they have yet to show much indication of being able to CREATE them. For the WRITING of that sort of complex instrumental music, there&rsquo;s no substitute for the dreaded and despised DWEM (Dead White European Male). </p>

		<p>This has has long been known in the restaurant/bar business, especially those places catering to middle class white women. For some reason, instrumental baroque music works best. Just endlessly play Vivaldi or Bach and you will never, never see the underclass. What is nice about this strategy is that it avoids all charges of racial discrimination. In lower class white venues, old-fashioned country western music plays the same role.     </p>

		<p>#2 Music Major, thank you for explaining the reasoning for why I love symphonic music and anything with tight harmonies. I knew what I felt; I just didn&rsquo;t know how to explain it or why it was that way. In addition, I dearly love to WATCH such music being created. A very good example of all this is Yanni&rsquo;s DVD of  his performance at the Acropolis with the London Royal Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Yanni&rsquo;s singularly, but the addition of the symphony adds so many levels of music to follow that I can hear and enjoy a different [set of] instruments each time I listen.</p>
<p>I can understand why this type of music is much too complex for many blacks and other minorities to comprehend.<br>

		<p>For attentive listening, my favorite music is jazz&hellip;I love that I never know where the next note is going, but it always seems to go to exactly the right place.</p>
<p>For background music, the only music I can tolerate is the country music I grew up listening to in the 1940s and 1950s&hellip;I love it, and it doesn&rsquo;t distract me, since I&rsquo;m as accustomed to it as I am to the sound of my own breathing.</p>
<p>I like classical music if I hear it live by a good orchestra, but I can&rsquo;t bear to listen to it recorded&hellip;it tends to flow along pleasantly, but then suddenly the cymbals clash, the trombones blast&hellip;whew, spare me! But Baroque oboe music, or Segovia playing Baroque&hellip;I like that and have used it to go to sleep by. But Bach is much too noisy for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by differences in musical tastes&hellip;I have friends who share my love for some particular songs, but we also each dislike some favorites of the other.</p>
<p>The correlation of musical tastes with personal traits would be an interesting field of study.</p>
<p>Since this is a racial site, I guess I should add that I probably differ from a lot of you in feeling that, if our racial arrangements could have remained static in the form of the segregation system in the South during the first half of the last century, I think blacks under that system were an asset&hellip;I&rsquo;ve always felt grateful I grew up in that era in the South. Especially in music, blacks added a lot to the feeling of the South&hellip;their influence on country music was apparently sizable (I would hate to have had to go through life listening to those old ballads in the form of Celtic music), and of course jazz was at least as much their creation as the creation of whites, is my impression. I&#8221;m always ready to be corrected. And bluesman Robert Johnson is a musician for the ages&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to miss him.</p>
<p>I hate black music created since they won their &#8220;freedom,&#8221; but I heard a guy the other day that made me wonder if I&rsquo;d missed a few things&hellip;this version of &#8220;Eleanor Rigby&#8221; by Stanley Jordan knocked my socks off&hellip;don&rsquo;t try it if you don&rsquo;t like jazz at all.</p>

<p>Might as well enjoy the few good things that come from the mess we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>If anyone knows any classical pieces as soothing as baroque oboes or baroque Segovia, I&rsquo;d appreciate some links. Oh, anyone like me who looks for soothing music, here&rsquo;s a gem of classical music I do love&hellip;A CD called, &#8220;The Most Relaxing Guitar Music in the Universe.&#8221; Another one: &#8220;Guitar Dreams.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ha, ha, it never occurred to me that playing my beloved classical music could successfully be used to keep out the riffraff!!!  No WONDER the more upscale restaurants and shops in my area ALWAYS play classical music   &mdash;   and we almost NEVER have any blacks or Mexicans in &#8220;those&#8221; places.  Of course, the fact that their prices are high might have something to do with it as well&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered the Symphony Orchestra to be the epitomy of Western development.  Not just the composition and talent necessary to play an instrument   But everything that is needed to make a Symphony work.   From the metalurgical skills needed to creat the instruments to the level of cooperation required between the musicians.  </p>
<p>It highlights everything the Western mind can concieve.</p>

		<p>Anyone care to go with the truism, it takes a higher IQ to appreciate Western Music, because OUR music was written for Whites in mind?</p>
<p>In other words, &#8216;It&rsquo;s a White Thing, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nah, might be considered &#8216;racissss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yup.</p>

		<p>I have had to overcome extreme contempt for Classical Music, caused by early exposure to a sleazy little &#8216;Music Appreciation&rsquo; record &#8220;explaining&#8221; Classical Music in the most insulting terms possible.  The music &#8216;explained&rsquo; was Peter &amp; the Wolf: &#8220;This is the Duck.  This is the Pig&hellip;&#8221;  To this day, I detest the later, &#8220;Narrative&#8221; devolution of Classical, particularly the junk &#8216;portraying&rsquo; guns in battle, horses galloping&hellip;.men marching&hellip;. It insults my intelligence that music is supposed to have to tell a &#8216;story&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Too, I find the later stuff to be discordant and discontinuous.  Music is not my field, but there is supposedly a cutoff point between True Classical (which indeed is restful and conducive of Focus), and the gimmicky, Narrative garbage (which simply wears me out).  True Classical enhances concentration&hellip;becoming beautiful Wallpaper.  Narrative Classical is needy&hellip;occasionally stopping to scream at you, to make sure all your attention is focused on ITSELF&hellip;how dare you crunch numbers in your head for your company&rsquo;s next expansion.  How dare you write that article.  How dare you do anything but sit and &#8216;appreciate&rsquo; its ostentatious complexities and &#8216;unique&rsquo;, &#8216;shocking&rsquo; juxtapositions.</p>
<p>My Decorator has several books out (by him, as well as featuring his work).  He cannot write without listening to Bach.  &#8220;Organizes my mind. Modulates time. Engages the part of my brain which would normally interfere with the writing.&#8221;  He explained to me that the jumpy, showy, discontinuous Narrative garbage arose to please the emerging class of newly rich War Mongers who were taking over Europe at the time&hellip;sweeping away the ancient nobility (the lovers of the older, gentler, more organized music).</p>
<p>It does not surprise me that this &#8216;heroic&rsquo; Narrative music should have arisen contemporary with Modern Warfare and the slaughter of unprecedented numbers of (white) people.  Another way of looking at it is that the emergence of &#8216;Storytelling Classical&rsquo; paralleled the triumph of the ongoing Epidemic of Ideology over the Age of Reason.</p>
<p>Me, I like Vivaldi, Scarlatti, Albinoni, Telemann&rsquo;s Viola Concerti, and Bach.  And I love the new variant of Industrial Techno, known as Aggrotech, as well as Scandinavian Melodic Death Metal. I also love the North European &#8216;Happy Hardcore&rsquo; my kids listen to. Aggrotech (Fusspils 11, Combichrist, Amduscia, Heimataerde, Grendel, Funker Vogt) has classical organization, I think, and the human voices are distorted into demonic growls which are not so distracting, as are more readily discernible Human words.</p>
<p>I use Industrial/Aggrotech (and Klezmer) to make me more aggressive/speed me up.  I use Baroque/Renaissance/True Classical, when I need deep concentration on a project.  I use Deepspace Ambient (Lustmord, Robert Rich), when I need an hypnotic state.</p>
<p>I absolutely refuse to tolerate Soul, Funk, Rap, Easy Listenin&rsquo;, smarmy &#8216;Love Songs&rsquo;, Sinatra-type &#8216;Lounge Music&rsquo;&hellip; and my feeling is that these are designed both to fill empty heads, and to keep heads empty.</p>
<p>True Classical, by contrast, is for people whose heads are already filled with complex thoughts.  True Classical Music enhances development and resolution of those thoughts, and the objectives to which they are related.</p>
<p>So naturally, those who have neither thoughts nor objectives would find Classical Music to be repellent.</p>

<p>Well, what can one say! Thanks for that!</p>
<p>For others like myself who can still feel some warmth for blacks in spite of everything, the segment between 4:50 minutes and 5:30 minutes of that same group, at</p>

<p>is interesting. </p>
<p>That lovely lady has a good voice, in addition to apparently being able to play every country instrument under the sun, just like the two guys with her, and with any luck she&rsquo;ll be a star.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings. If blacks and their behavior were still under control, my joy in a group like this would be unrestrained. But with things as they are, the success of a group like this probably helps push forward the current racial madness also.</p>

		<p><i>I always liked &ldquo;Steel Guitar Rag&rdquo;, but I like to just hear Hank Williams singing a whole lot more.</i></p>

<p>Where does that put me?</p>
<p>Perhaps country, bluegrass etc. is for Whites in the middle-of-the-road, ~100 IQ range. FYI, blacks don&rsquo;t like White country music either.</p>
<p><i>And I don&rsquo;t think that &ldquo;instrumental&rdquo; versus &ldquo;vocal&rdquo; is a valid distinction. I like opera, which is just about as vocal as it gets. Would that, in this study, indicate that I don&rsquo;t like classical music? A lot of loose ends here.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d expect classical vocal music (Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem, quality Italian opera, classical Masses, etc.) would count as &#8220;instrumental&#8221; if only because the voice parts are enmeshed within the instrumental whole, whether in a leading role or not.</p>

		<p>Jazz and progressive rock with long instrumental passages are also indicators of high IQ. I find the smartest blacks listen to classical music and jazz. In the UK they found the smartest kids like classical music and heavy rock (which, lets face it, is often played by guitar virtuosos and has Wagnerian dynamics).

<p>It would be interesting to somehow get an accurate account of the difference in the percentage of white people who like country music and the percentage of black people who like country music.</p>
<p>in my experience, most white people do not like country music, at least what I think of as country music&hellip;the country music of the golden age of the 40s and 50s and some wonderful current stuff in the same vein. And as to black people liking country music or not, the performer that I linked in post 33, in the 40 second time slot I stipulated there, has some interesting remarks about blacks that approach her after a concert and &#8220;furtively&#8221; tell her how much they like that kind of music. These blacks I assume might possibly not answer honestly if publicly polled.</p>
<p>And thanks for being patient and courteous with me as I struggle here as best I can with my 100 IQ.</p>

		<p>Well Brendan #34 I&rsquo;m heartened to know that you can peg me as a middle of the road 100 IQ White. (actually I tested at 140) Your capacity to recognize nuanced humor and amusement might need some attention though. You are also incorrect in noting that Blacks have a universal dislike of C&W;/Bluegrass music. That holds true by and large for Afro-Americans, but if you check out the music scene on the Carribean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras, you&rsquo;ll find hundreds of Charley Pride type bands playing in the honky tonks. Nevertheless these cultures are also heavily afflicted by bling/crack/gangsta culture.</p>
