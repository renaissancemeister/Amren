			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rosa Prince, Telegraph (London), February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The failure of racist American bankers to provide black home owners with fair mortgages fuelled the financial crisis, Trevor Phillips, the equalities chief, will claim in a major speech this week. </p>
<p>Calling on the Government to ensure that the programme of public sector cuts does not fall disproportionately on minorities, Mr Phillips will warn that discrimination can have unexpected economic consequences.</p>
<p>Addressing the Policy Exchange think tank, he will argue that the phenomenon of subprime home loans, which led to the 2008 banking collapse, emerged because even wealthy black families could not obtain regular mortgages.</p>
<p>A number of banks involved in the crash, including Lehman Brothers and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), were over reliant on toxic subprime loans to customers who could not afford to maintain repayments.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips will say: &#8220;I know it&rsquo;s not a thing that the bankers and economists like to talk about, but the American financial crisis was precipitated at least in part by racial prejudice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why were so many minority families taking these expensive loans?</p>
<p>Because discrimination left them with no choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rapid growth of the sub-prime market in the past decade probably owed more to the history of racial discrimination than any other factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Phillips said before the crash that black families in the US were more likely than white people to be charged higher interest rates and have a subprime loan.</p>
<p>In order to prevent a repeat of the problem here during the recovery, he said the Equalities Commission would carry out a review of the Coalition&rsquo;s cuts programme.</p>
<p>Mr Phillips will say: &#8220;Racism did not cause the crisis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we would probably have faced a meltdown at some point even if all the loans had been to white folks.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no doubt that when the full story is unravelled we&rsquo;ll find that a racial factor did play a role in what happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now know what it led to. Perhaps now is the time to make sure that we don&rsquo;t repeat the mistakes we made going into recession on the way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spending review and the cuts that follow must not fall disproportionately on already disadvantaged social groupings.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Hey, Phillips.  Every hear of a credit score derived from a person&rsquo;s credit history?  Sure you have.  And you KNOW the reason the blacks TOOK those high cost loans, forced upon the banks by the US Federal Government and the likes of Barney Frank, is because they all had lousy credit scores resulting from multiple defaults on previous loans.<br>
So, when they defaulted on their home loans in great numbers, consistent with their history, the bubble burst.  The Fed Government guaranteeing risky loans that nobody otherwise would touch then had to bail out the banks and mortgage bundlers.  It wasn&rsquo;t prejudice against minorities that caused the failures, IT WAS IMBECILIC PC CORRECT BIAS IN FAVOR OF MINORITIES that caused the problem and the failures.  Would YOU have co-signed for any of those &#8220;poor minorities&#8221;?  Thought not.  Shut up and sit down jerk.</p>

		<p>This Trevor Phillips needs to do some research before making such claims.  Wasn&rsquo;t it the NAACP and the ACLU that forced the government to make more loans to unqualified minorities?  That was back in 1992, or earlier.  It just got worse after 9/11 when Bush used it as an empty economy booster.</p>

		<p>We have many rich blacks in America.  Some, like Oprah, achieved wealth through success in the popular media.  Others became multimillionaires  through athletic achievement.  Others are CEOs of major companies.  So how come none of these rich people got together to form a bank that would give mortgages at fair terms to all those conscientious, reliable blacks who needed one?  After all, having the market to themselves (according to the liberals who complain about &#8220;racist&#8221; banks), they could have charged an extra quarter of a point in interest and cleaned up.  Maybe because those rich blacks know more than anyone else that the blacks complaining about redlining are not such great credit risks after all.</p>

		<p>Are banks just vultures that do anything they can to stick it to the public while lining their own pockets?<br>
I have had a mortgage loan with a major bank for about 10 years I have never been late on even one payment. I retired about 4 years ago and when I saw a chance to lower my payment $200.00 by refinancing I went into the same bank where my loan already was and applied. The letter I got back from them said although my credit score was more than adequate my income didn&rsquo;t justify a loan at this time. I asked how they thought it would be more difficult for me to make a payment $200.00 less than what I had been making and they just said &#8220;Sorry you don&rsquo;t qualify&#8221; now had I said No Comprendo would I have gotten any farther?</p>

How pathetically biased and short sighted.<br>
Various pressure groups, through the conduit of Frank, Dodd, and even Obama pushed the system hard, to give liars loans, and pushed banks to make many minority loans, with the threat of anti-discrimination suits if they didn,t. Of course the &#8220;useful idiot&#8221; Bush, after some initial token opposition, pushed his bank examiners to &#8220;encourage &#8221; these imprudent loans.  Business ventures wouldn&rsquo;t be approved if the bank wasn&rsquo;t promoting minority ownership.  I talked to a conservative banker who told me that they were pushed by their regulator to make more loans before the bubble.  These liar and fibber loans of  course overstimulated the housing market and caused prices to be too high.  Young couples coming to their time for house purchase, were caught in this and were the real victims of these phenomena.  They lost their homes because they were caught in this corrupt bubble.  If they could have purchased a home at the right price, and not followed by a collapse, many would have been spared this nightmare.  The blame and the fault lay at the hands of very bad government, dying to please the NAACP etc.  </p>

		<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny, because I distinctly remember when blacks were claiming that bankers were racist for failing to give them loans. Oh, wait, I&rsquo;m thinking like a white guy. In black world, logical consistency is just an oppressive white construct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Phillips will warn that discrimination can have unexpected economic consequences&#8221;<br>
Like&hellip;not having your financial system collapse when a bunch of &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; borrowers default on their loans?</p>

		<p>Once again, you can&rsquo;t win blacks.  If they didn&rsquo;t get loans, they&rsquo;d scream racism.  Now they got loans that they couldn&rsquo;t afford and didn&rsquo;t pay back, and are whining about being conned into it.  Poor little victims.  If you&rsquo;re reading this, Leonard Pitts, cry me a river.</p>

		<p>Trevor Phillips is no economist.  If blatantly un-creditworthy blacks and Hispanics would have gotten the &#8220;less risky&#8221; lower rate regular mortgages that civilized people with good credit scores can regularly get, then the real estate bubble would have gotten a lot larger and therefore the bubble bursting would have been a lot more dramatic, and the fall would have been a lot more steep and the nadir a lot deeper.</p>

		<p>I think the fault of the financial crisis can clearly be laid at the hands of one man: Alan Greenspan.  He simply let too many bubbles get out of the hand:</p>
<p>1.  Tech Bubble 2000<br>
2.  Real Estate Bubble 2008</p>
<p>By engaging in massive credit creation he caused too much leverage to be built up in the entire financial economic/system.  Princeton University did a great presentation on this:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3jj4n5" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3jj4n5</a></p>
<p>What happened was that even though the &#8220;real economy&#8221; expanded between by 2X from 1988-2008 the &#8220;financial economy&#8221; expanded by 30X in the same period.</p>
<p>Also Tice from Prudent Bear did some great analysis to show that debt expanded for all three groups:</p>
<p>1.  Consumers<br>
2.  Government<br>
3.  Corporations</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4bm5uc4" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/4bm5uc4</a></p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just a particular group that increased it&rsquo;s leverage but every single group in the economy.</p>
<p>Of course many of these systemic risk issues were known as early as 2001,incidentally the man who wrote this report &#8220;resigned&#8221; a week after it was published:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/4n39dzz</p>
<p>Fannie also understood that their overall portfolio was deteriorating as well by 2007 although I do think the original material actually dates back to 2005.</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/4kkyroo</p>
<p>In short the United States simply has a self destructive financial system that was destined to collapse because it became dependent upon the geometric expansion of debt and leverage.</p>
<p>Hyman Minsky covered this in his theory of &#8220;Ponzi Finance&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4ckbesv" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/4ckbesv</a></p>
<p>In effect he said that the eventually any stable credit system would devolve into gigantic Ponzi Finance Scheme.  The best known example that has yet to collapse is social security:</p>

<p>Indeed. </p>
<p>And one can ask why liberals in general do not put their money where their collective mouth is. For example, liberals might open grocery stores in the inner cities. Or set up private schools open to the underclass regardless of academic achievement and bus their own children to them. Or start businesses which would have all the &#8220;diversity&#8221; they want. But invariably, liberals want to use the power of the state to get their way. It always seems to come down to control of the state machinery which can then be used to impose liberalism on everyone else.<br>

<p>I believe this was mentioned in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s Book &#8220;Paved With Good Intentions&#8221;.  There were attempts by blacks to open and run banks.  If memory serves me right, they found themselves having to reject black applicants for the same reasons that caused rejections at white banks  &mdash;  low credit scores and not enough income.  </p>
