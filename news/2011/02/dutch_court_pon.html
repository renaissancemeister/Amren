<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20110214/EU.Netherlands.Hate.Speech/">Dutch Court Ponders Halt to Lawmaker&rsquo;s Hate Trial</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Toby Sterling, Comcast News, February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Amsterdam court will reconsider dismissing the hate speech trial of one of the Netherland&rsquo;s most popular leaders, an anti-immigrant politician who has compared Islam to fascism and called for a ban on the Quran.</p>
<p>Preliminary objections to Geert Wilders&rsquo; trial were heard by another panel of judges last year, but that court stepped down when it became embroiled in allegations of potential bias against him.</p>
<p>A new court ruled Monday that Wilders&rsquo; defense team had a right to present its preliminary objections again, and if they are granted &#8220;then the case is over and out,&#8221; said Judge Marcel van Oosten.</p>
<p>Wilders, the powerful head of the Freedom Party, faces charges of &#8220;inciting discrimination&#8221; for his remarks, which opponents say have led to more anti-Muslim discrimination. Wilders denies wrongdoing, saying he has a right to freedom of speech and that many Dutch voters support him.<br>

		<p>Their original plan was to lock him up and throw away the key, gulag style.  But now if they do that he will be considered a martyr.  The best thing for liberals is to let it go.  They hoped he would cave, they hoped the people would scream for blood.  None of that happened.  This is the power of Liberals without their puppets.  While going through all this Geert only got more power for this.  But when he is released, the judges will say one more thing before he walks out the door.  &#8220;We&rsquo;re sorry and we didn&rsquo;t even want to go through with this.  They will beg for his forgiveness because Geert will be the most powerful politico in the country at that moment.  Geert, do not waste a second after their comment.  Get out there and say everything the moment you reach the stairs.  Make it awe-inspiring.  Make it so ground-breaking that they put a statue of you up right where you stood.  A monument to whites who want to be with other whites and is not afraid to say it.</p>
<p>Right now eErope could swing any way, these few seemingly insignificant actions its what will push it in our direction.</p>

		<p>If a government can control what political parties can advocate, democracy is a farce. Voting then becomes a ritual with no political significance.  </p>

		<p>Too bad we don&rsquo;t have a Geert Wilders here in Canada.</p>
<p>All we have are traitors.</p>
<p>Our conservative government just announced with great pride that they have allowed the greatest number of immigrants in the past 50 years!</p>

		<p>One has to wonder if these &#8220;anti-hate&#8221; statutes were put on the books with no realistic intention of applying them.  But, of course, the mood is swinging drastically to the right in Europe, and elected officials know it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on Dutch politics, but I suspect GW is riding a wave of popularity and the trial may actually helping his cause. Therefore, I think GW&rsquo;s political opponents are eager to see this trial over and done with.</p>
