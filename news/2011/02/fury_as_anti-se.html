			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Rawlinson, Independent (London), February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A German banker who has said &#8220;all Jews share a certain gene&#8221; and described Muslims as &#8220;dunces&#8221; will speak tonight at the London School of Economics amid a row over free speech.</p>
<p>Anti-facist campaigners vowed to demonstrate outside the LSE during Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s appearance in a debate on multiculturalism. The former executive member of the Bundesbank caused outrage in Germany last year with his comments, in which he also attacked Basques. He was removed from the country&rsquo;s central bank and raked down by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who called him &#8220;stupid&#8221;. </p>
<p>Jewish groups in London warned yesterday that allowing Mr Sarrazin a platform in Britain would be &#8220;provocative and almost certain to stir further hatred and offence&#8221;. He also labelled Germany&rsquo;s Middle Eastern population &#8220;dunces&#8221; and attacked Muslims for not integrating well. Mr Sarrazin is due to appear as a speaker in a debate as part of the German Symposium event organised by the German Society at LSE. </p>
<p>Sabby Dhalu, the joint secretary of Unite Against Fascism, called for Mr Sarrazin to be banned from the UK. &#8220;There is grotesque double standards in the implementation of bans on people entering Britain. There is no doubt that a known Muslim spouting similar views would be denied entry,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>&#8220;LSE&rsquo;s German society&rsquo;s invitation to Thilo Sarrazin to address their &#8216;Future of Germany&rsquo; meeting is misguided and ill-judged. The title and invitation imply that Sarrazin is the future. I wonder how many Jewish and Muslim German people agree with him? Such vile, racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic views have no place in Britain, Germany or any other country.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Symposium&rsquo;s organisers defended the decision to invite Mr Sarrazin, whose book, Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany does away with itself), has outraged many in Germany. Eva Gorenflo, a spokesman for the LSE German society, said: &#8220;Everybody should be allowed to express what they think and it is important that Mr Sarrazin be allowed to do that. &#8220;The speakers are going to have an open debate. It would be difficult to have a debate if everyone already agreed with each other. People will be given the opportunity to ask questions. I didn&rsquo;t know they were planning to protest. We are hoping that everything runs smoothly. Those people are allowed to express their opinions and they are welcome to join the debate as well. As Benjamin Franklin said: &#8216;Without freedom of thought, there is no such thing as wisdom&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>
<p>The LSE supported the society&rsquo;s decision to invite Mr Sarrazin. A spokesman said: &#8220;LSE is committed to the principles of free speech and is, traditionally, a place where renowned speakers come to explain their thinking and answer questions. Students are free to hold and express their own views and this extends to organising events.&#8221; </p>
<p>A Home Office spokesman refused to comment on any individual cases. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has the power to ban anyone from the country whose presence is not considered conducive to the public good but Mr Sarrazin&rsquo;s entry to Britain is not thought to have been barred. <br>

		<p>Sounds awfully familiar - very much like U.S.A. hotels refusing to allow AmRen to hold its conference within their walls&hellip;.  What is the problem with allowing multiple viewpoints?  30 years ago and more it was possible - but, since the Left has come to dominate in just about every area, the maturity level of people has diminished and so has the ability to tolerate more than one viewpoint.  I for one am very tired of the childishness of the Left, and even more tired of the fact that they are currently in control of the mores in this country.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s right about the double standards, but wrong about the victims.  The victims are right wingers.  The American talk radio host born Michael Alan Weiner is still prohibited from England, and the publicity hound preacher of a rinky dink church in Florida that wanted to &#8220;burn a Koran&#8221; also got put on the blacklist.  Muslims who do far worse are still let in.</p>

		<p>Third Worlders never want to debate.  They just want to silence.  I am also quite sick of Jewish groups silencing everyone that doesn&rsquo;t agree with them or bow before them.  If it&rsquo;s nonsense, what the heck are they so afraid of?  They&rsquo;re all afraid of independent critical thinking!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Such vile, racist, anti-Semetic, and Islamophobic views have no place in Britain&#8221;, said Sabby. Which one is it. When Muhammad  was embarrassed that the jews did not follow him he stated that the &#8220;jews are from the devil&#8221;. So, muslims are, from their very nature, anti-semetic. Is she saying there is no place for muslims in Britain? The concept of diversity does not work because not all of the &#8220;diversity&#8221; share our equality values. I am confused. </p>

		<p>Muslims don&rsquo;t integrate?  Middle Easterners are Dunces?  And (wait for it) Jews connected through genes actually share a gene together!  I don&rsquo;t even see how he insulted Jews honestly.  But if the shoe was on the other foot, it would be everyday talk.  Wrong again article.  These Jews, Muslims, and Gypies, etc. DO have a right to be in Germany.  In every white country in the world, In fact.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Divide Germany, France, and England down to middle.  Take all those that are not native and put them on side.  Take all others and put them on the other side.  Put liberals in cages for ten years then release them on the &#8220;diverse&#8221; side and see if their utopia was reached in that amount of time.</p>

		<p>Odd&hellip;counteless Jewish authors and observers commonly, and casually profess that, &#8220;all Jews share a certain gene.&#8221; and no &#8220;anti-fa&#8221; say a word. What a surprise, Lefty hypocrisy!</p>

		<p>There is nothing in Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s book that can be considered anti Jewish, anti Semitic. The worst were some comment that Jewish people share common genes, heritage and tend to have higher IQs - not exactly vicious hate speech against Jews.</p>
<p>But all should note that the PC thought police will always attempt to smear anyone who speaks up for White Western people as A JEW HATING NAZI - including those who speak out against any non White Western people such as extremist Muslims.</p>
<p>Europe has had many leaders, artists, political parties opposing mass Muslim immigration from a Liberal/Left perspective  - correctly observing the obvious that 3rd world immigrant Muslim communities do not share Western European ideals of women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights, individual rights respect for animals.</p>
<p>Such brave Western men from the Left like Theo Van Gogh and Pym Fortuyn gave their lives to speak up for Western freedoms against the Muslim invasion.</p>
<p>But for the PC crowd - they do not care about reporting the truth - it must always be those on our side are evil, racist NAZIS - Jew haters, the same as the worst NAZIS of the 1940s.</p>
<p>Never let these lies go unchallenged - always contact the news source and the organization spreading the lies and simply ask them to stop lying.</p>

		<p>Well I&rsquo;m would be really surprised that Jews share common ancestry in such a well that it defines them together (well really every race has a common ancestry as we are all homo sapiens) because the last I checked anti-semitic means against Semites. What are Semites? Semitic peoples Jewish descended from the middle eastern region they have hooked noses and very tan skin slightly lighter than peoples of the middle east.</p>
<p>Ashkenazim Jews descended from eastern Europe and Russia. There are many theories as to how these people came about. They are Europeans by definition being inhabitants of Europe well before WW2 for thousands of years. Some say they have a link to upper Asian middle eastern descent that has a &#8220;bottle neck&#8221; (but this geneticist says https://www.npitv.com/264 says not so).</p>
<p>But yes, before any of you ask, I do see the irony and hypocrisy of having a Jewish state by those who condemn racism (levels of hypocrisy may or may not be totally similar).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part Ashkenazim and part Italian (with Nordic blood). I ALWAYS considered myself white and pass as white&hellip;always been looked as white by everyone under the sun. Very few Ashkenazim have hooked noses unless they have Semetic blood in them and the many orthodox Ashkenazim have red hair! But anyone with different views I&rsquo;m open to listening without name calling or calling one anti-semitic.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Anywho&hellip;</p>
<p>I find it irony in &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; (the spell checker even doesn&rsquo;t think it is a word) considering it that the original phobia is homosexuality. And what religion loves homosexuals more that Islam?</p>

		<p>Sarrazin is by no stretch of imagination anti-Semitic, his critics are simply liars.</p>
<p>Like all European intellectuals who grew up after World War II, Sarrazin is fully aware of the contributions made by Jews to European civilization, and of the catastrophic loss of intellectual capital - for Germany and Europe as a whole - which occurred under Nazi rule through the deportation and murder of millions of Jews.</p>
<p>He has gone on record as saying that it would be good for Germany to attract more Jews.</p>
<p>As for European Muslims, virtually all are every bit as anti-Semitic as Hitler and the Nazis, and if Eurabia becomes a reality, Europe&rsquo;s Jews will either be murdered or forced to emigrate again.</p>
<p>The top priority for the Jewish intelligentsia in the United States and Europe should to reverse Muslim immigration.</p>

		<p>I am White and practice Judaism. I do not see anything offensive toward the Jews here. I just think because of the horrific past of Germany things are blown out of proportion.  The sad part is the Germans/Euros traded thousands of years living side by side with european jews and traded them for these Turks and Arab 3rd world dunces. Its hard to feel to bad, they did made there bed.</p>
