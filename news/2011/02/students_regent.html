			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Martinez and Tom Mcginty, Wall Street Journal, February 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Wall Street Journal analysis of high-school Regents test scores shows that a disproportionate percentage of New York City students barely got the passing score they needed to receive a diploma in the past two years, while very few received scores just below passing.</p>
<p>For the 2009 English Regents exams, for instance, students were more than five times as likely to get a 65  &mdash;  the minimum passing grade  &mdash;  than they were to score one point below. In the U.S. History and Government Regents, students were 14 times more likely to get a 65 than one point lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no question that there&rsquo;s something fishy going on,&#8221; said Jonah Rockoff, a professor at Columbia University&rsquo;s business school who frequently analyzes schools-related data sets.</p>
<p>In New York state, high-school teachers score their own students&rsquo; tests  &mdash;  which differs from tests in most other states, as well as New York&rsquo;s own third- through eighth-grade tests. Mr. Rockoff, who reviewed the Regents data, said, &#8220;It looks like teachers are pushing kids over the edge. They are very reluctant to fail a kid who needs just one or two points to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials from the New York City Department of Education say there is nothing untoward happening. They note that the state actually requires teachers to regrade certain Regents tests where the student barely fails in order to check for grading errors. &#8220;All of our teachers are trained on the State&rsquo;s scoring policy before grading the Regents exams, and we&rsquo;re confident the vast majority are adhering to those State guidelines,&#8221; said Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for the city&rsquo;s DOE.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some skeptics aren&rsquo;t convinced. Mr. Rockoff points to the eighth-grade math scores in New York City for 2009, which aren&rsquo;t graded by the students&rsquo; own teachers. There is no similar clustering at the break point for passing the test. He estimates that 3% to 4% of the students who passed the Regents test last year should have failed, based on the DOE data. He said teachers have effectively lowered the passing score on Regents tests to 62 or 63.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teachers refer to the practice of lifting test scores as &#8220;scrubbing.&#8221; After teachers grade tests  &mdash;  many times their own students or those of their colleagues  &mdash;  they set aside tests in which the students just missed passing. Teachers say that is generally from 60 to 64, but can go as low as 57. The teachers then ask the original scorer to take another look at the test to see if an argument could be made for giving the student an extra point or more.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some teachers said the pressure to receive a good grade from the city&rsquo;s Department of Education, which doles out A&rsquo;s through F&rsquo;s based on the number of students passing Regents tests, has driven them to be more generous on the scoring. The DOE has been trying to close schools that get lower grades.</p>
<p>But the concentration around 65s can be seen in other major New York cities, like Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo, where such school-accountability systems don&rsquo;t exist. Looking at past New York City data, Mr. Rockoff said the patterns around the score of 65 were &#8220;just as strong in 2000, so it&rsquo;s hard to argue that accountability under Bloomberg and Klein pushed teachers to pass more kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelle Costa, a high-school math teacher in New York City, said she often hears from friends who teach at other schools who scrub tests, though she doesn&rsquo;t do it. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state department of education guidelines for teachers scoring Regents tests say that student papers receiving 60 to 64 in only math or science &#8220;must be scored a second time to ensure the accuracy of the score.&#8221; But the Wall Street Journal analysis shows that test scores appear to be skewed in all of the main subject areas including English and history.</p>

		<p>The more the Education Establishment adjusts the curriculum and standards down to allow so-called minority students to pass, the more the so-called minority students will adjust their work efforts down to whatever is necessary to just get by, if that.  You can&rsquo;t fix stupid no matter who much money you throw at it. All this this moaning about the Achievement Gap is a distraction anyway.  Parents and students who are serious about education should realize that education is not a priority of the Establishment in this country and, in fact, a truly educated public is the last thing they want. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me that states don&rsquo;t hit on the simple solution to non-white school failure.  Simply change the law to make school optional.  Currently, it&rsquo;s illegal to not attend school, everywhere in the US.  But is that rational or reasonable?</p>
<p>The very reason IQ testing was created was to separate out those who could not benefit from an education from those who could, so as not to waste everyone&rsquo;s time, money and to humiliate the mentally defective.  At least half and maybe as much as 80% of blacks meet the original guidelines.  Similar results for those of amerind genetic background.</p>
<p>None of those kids wants to be in school.  None of them benefit in the slightest from school.  None of them willingly engage the process.  So let them go home, if they want.  It would change nothing in their lives.</p>
<p>But it would vastly improve our educational system for those who can learn.  Simple choice.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s too late, you know. The scam has been out of the bag for a while. They might as well just give blacks a score of 95.</p>
<p>Anyone without a lobotomy knows that a high school diploma from the esteemed NYC public school system is meaningless. It has no value, especially among blacks. </p>
<p>On the one hand I simply cannot believe how short-sighted and self-damaging this behavior is among African-Americans and their enablers. On the other hand, look at the source.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the school system was run in a fair and competent manner. That the subject material and testing were rigorous and enforced. Would all blacks graduate? Of course not. But some would. In that case, the diploma has value. But by shoving a diploma into the hand of every black student the diploma now has no value. Every black is pegged as mental failure who got a free ride. It&rsquo;s affirmative action taken to its end point. It basically affirms the belief one is attempting to erase.</p>
<p>Besides, what college worth its salt wants a class full of students with a 65 in every subject anyway? Well, we all know the answer to that - the HBCUs - but that&rsquo;s another subject entirely.</p>
<p>This bogus grading makes fools of the teachers because they cannot (yet) manipulate the standardized exams (ACT, SAT&hellip;) so there is a huge disconnect in scores - which exposes the folly. That&rsquo;s the reason such exams exist.</p>
<p>Everyone reading this needs to plan ahead by getting white families and friends on board. Whites will need to open private schools, just far enough away from the city, and simply have their children attend there (homeschooling on a mass scale is simply not feasible and may in fact delay white cohesiveness).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a legal form of self-segregation. It&rsquo;s also a prelude to secession but that too is another story. It will take work and perseverance and especially smarts but that is on our side and that always wins out in the end.</p>
<p>Let the public school rot in their multicultural slime because schools do more than teach - they indoctrinate. Whites need to finally start getting on the indoctrination bandwagon and driving it themselves.</p>

		<p>if 14 times as many students are earning grades of 65 than just a point or two below, this does NOT suggest that all of these are kids who were bumped up from 63 or 64.</p>
<p>In that case, the disproportion would be circa 1:2, not 1:14. </p>
<p>it suggests instead that a wide swath of failing students are being bumped up to 65.<br>

		<p>I notice they only double check if the student barely failed, so, by the same logic, they double check if the student barely passes.  Yeah, like that&rsquo;ll happen.  </p>
<p>@#2 - I think that&rsquo;s a bit lenient, we need a penalty for quitting such as being required to do unskilled manual labor if you quit or aren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to pass the test and not motivated enough to acquire a trade. Add a graduated system that rewards intelligence with increasingly greater opportunities and scholarships and things start to look up for our country - if we stop allowing immigrants to fill all the tech jobs.</p>

		<p>This has been going on in Atlanta as well and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is cracking down on it. All the black nay-sayers and rabble rousers are of course calling the GBI &ldquo;racist&rdquo;.<br>
