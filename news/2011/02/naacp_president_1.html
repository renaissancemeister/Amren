<h1>NAACP President Attacks Huntsville School System, Threatens Legal Action</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Banaszak, WHNT-TV (Huntsville, Alabama), February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Already dealing with an ongoing financial crisis that&rsquo;s forcing layoffs and possible school closures, Huntsville City Schools now faces the threat of a lawsuit from the NAACP.</p>
<p>Local NAACP chapter president Alice Sams ripped the school system in a press conference Monday morning, while also presenting a list of demands the organization wants fulfilled immediately.</p>
<p>Sams and other leaders from Huntsville&rsquo;s black community are accusing Huntsville City Schools of creating a divided system tilted against black students. The NAACP said the school district has failed to abide by a 1970 federal court order that officially eliminated segregation in schools for Alabama and other southern states.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have compiled a list of concerns, which in short is entitled &#8216;What We Want,&#8221; said Sams. &#8220;If satisfactory steps are not taken to satisfy our concerns, we may petition the state department of education to take over Huntsville City Schools and request Department of Justice and federal court intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>NAACP officials say the alleged inequalities will only be made greater if several schools targeted for closure in predominantly black North Huntsville end up shutting their doors. The organization cited a forty point achievement gap between black and white students on standardized state tests, calling the results unfair and unacceptable. Sams said the blame did not fall on students or their parents, but rather on schools she claims are inferior compared to those in predominantly white South Huntsville. School closures are a likelihood as the district aims to overcome a $20 million budget deficit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sams ended her speech with a bold statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent revolution inevitable,&#8221; said Sams, who quoted former president John F. Kennedy. {snip}</p>
<p>School board attorney J.R. Brooks declined our request for an on-camera interview and did not respond to the NAACP&rsquo;s claims. He only said the school district had always been in compliance with federal court orders issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, and that the school board had no control or authority over people who had voluntarily moved in and out of North Huntsville since 1970.<br>

		<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like somebody else said before - it&rsquo;s NEVER the blacks&rsquo; fault that their people are substandard; they ALWAYS blame somebody else, in this case, the school system.  How convenient.  Unfortunately, the world is wising up.  People are starting to NOTICE that when tragedies hit any community except a black one, the residents of the community band together and do the necessary corrective work THEMSELVES, without blaming anyone, and without demanding help from the Feds, the State, or anyone else.  Blacks just sit back on their ample a**es and whine about how it is absolutely somebody else&rsquo;s fault that their people aren&rsquo;t up to snuff.  It starts at home, people; single mother homes cannot possibly produce young people who have any appreciable decent standards of behavior in any area - and we already know that parental example is the most important factor in every child&rsquo;s young life.  Like parent, like child - show me a kid who&rsquo;s 4 years behind in reading &amp; math, and I&rsquo;ll show you a single mom who works, smokes, drinks, and maybe even does a line now and then on the weekends.  Those habits affect the very GENES that get passed on to the kids - and by definition such genes are substandard.  So it CANNOT be any surprise that these kids are so far behind their white counterparts.  We say, &#8220;Lower your expectations and improve your performance&#8221; - and we get great results by practicing that.  When blacks mature enough to take responsibility for their every thought, word and act - they might be able to practice the same thing and get the same good results.</p>

<p>I agree, but this is civil rights and equality we&rsquo;re talking about here, which is &#8220;more important than anything.&#8221;  All you&rsquo;re doing here is giving them ideas.  They&rsquo;ll add another demand to their precious little list, that some level of government force people to live in certain neighborhoods to maintain a racial balance.</p>

		<p>It is the fault of those older, white teachers who teach in the black schools. Obviously.  Right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a solution: offer to double fund the black schools as compared to any majority white schools.  Offer that every teacher and other worker in the black schools will be black also.  The white majority schools don&rsquo;t need to be all white as all races of teachers can apply.</p>
<p>So give them double funding, a guarantee of no discrimination in hiring in white majority schools, and &#8216;role models&rsquo; that &#8216;look like them&rsquo; in the all black schools.  I dare anyone to make this offer to them.</p>

		<p>Ah, the obligatory sign-off with a threat of violence. Do these people HAVE to be so utterly predictable?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it easier just to socially promote blacks for showing up and remaining reasonably non-disruptive, i.e. threatening violence more often than actually engaging in it? Employers know the value of a high school diploma in black hands, and avoid hiring them whenever possible anyway.</p>
<p>Give the NAACP what they want and pass them on. It&rsquo;s just another part of the big hypocrisy that has become our state religion of diversity.</p>

		<p>The NAACP &#8220;cited a forty point achievement gap between black and white students on standardized state tests, calling the results unfair and unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>COMMENT: A succinct definition of the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is useful when thinking about complaints such as the NAACP&rsquo;s. This is Education Trust&rsquo;s definition: </p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Education Trust, &ldquo;Closing the Achievement Gap,&rdquo; National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>
http://tinyurl.com/2d6sayq</p>
<p>Note the words &#8220;if they do so [reach 12th grade] at all.&#8221;  Those words means that the achievement gap is &#8220;four years&#8221; for the above-average contingent of black students still in school by 12th grade.  The below-average contingent black students (half the age cohort) has already dropped out before 12th grade. <br>

		<p>There is no segregation in Huntsville. It&rsquo;s a simple matter of white flight. Violent and uneducable blacks have driven white families out of the district. Now, they blame the schools for what their own violence and ignorance has done. </p>
<p>Appeasing those race hustlers isn&rsquo;t an option. It only encourages more unreasonable demands. If you stand your ground they will get nasty. But one can&rsquo;t afford appeasement because it never ends.</p>

Unfair?  How so?</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your troubles, but thanks for playing the game of life!  </p>
<p>Not everyone wins, but somehow we have remade segregation by letting school children go to the schools IN THEIR neighborhood.  Anyone can go to that school, but they have to live in that school district.</p>

		<p>Guess what. That 40 point gap isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. One hundred years and 100 million dollars from now there will still be a 40 point gap. Unfortunately, there may not be an America.</p>
<p>The only option, really, is segregation and ultimately secession. The nation is run by fools and cowards. </p>
<p>Staking a new claim on the new northern white homeland is essential.</p>

		<p>I spent my entire life as a firebreathing liberal, denouncing &#8220;racists&#8221; like the best of them (but secretly - and guiltily - wondered why blacks were so consistently unintelligent and dysfunctional despite all of the privileges lavished on them).</p>
<p>finally, it all fell apart simply because the unspeakable, hideous, shocking behavior of so many blacks kept crashing through my well practice denial mechanisms:</p>
<p>why are they taking advantage of the incredible opportunities being lavished on them by white America????</p>
<p>finally, the light went on in my head:</p>
<p>even after the heroic and unprecedented efforts of the past decades, with costs in the hundreds of millions or even trillions of dollars, YOU are still blaming US because you are stupid?</p>
<p>because you are violent?</p>
<p>because you abuse drugs?</p>
<p>because you are utterly indifferent to your own children?</p>
<p>because our communities are hell holes from which the decent few will sacrifice everything to escape into&hellip;&hellip;WHITE communities?????</p>
<p>my world suddenly turned upside down:</p>
<p>is up to YOU to prove that you&rsquo;re smart, hard-working, law-abiding, responsible, reliable citizens, good parents, decent human beings!!!!!!</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all on you, it&rsquo;s not my problem. </p>
<p>which is how ALL!!!!!! white people feel, except most are part of a crazy cult called &#8220;antiracism&#8221; and desperately need to be deprogrammed.</p>
<p>let the deprogramming began!!</p>

 <br>
That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s not their fault they&rsquo;re so dangerous and inferior. It&rsquo;s our fault. <br>
 <br>
More somberly, blacks and their white apologists should be ashamed to mention the achievement gap. It exists everywhere. It always has. It survives despite expensive efforts to bridge it. <br>

		<p>Response to Anonymous post #6:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve given this a lot of thought, and here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come up with: require sterilization of each applicant for welfare, food stamps, or other similar public assistance.  </p>
<p>Anyone who can&rsquo;t afford to support themselves has no business bringing more indigents into the world, and society should have no obligation to provide for irresponsible breeding.</p>
<p>This would quickly put an end to the practice of &#8220;playing&#8221; the system by receiving additional benefits for having multiple children.  It would also take a lot of pressure off schools now crowded by &#8220;under-privileged,&#8221; undisciplined minority students.</p>

Much of the irritation of the AM REN commentators has less to do with antipathy specific racial groups than the reaction to the lies, guilt-mongering, and brainwashing that were systematically pummeled into the brains of those of us having grown up in the Post-MLK USA.

		<p>Once again,  I grew up on the east side of what used to be a great city&hellip;. Detroit.  It was a beautiful area of all brick homes with fireplaces and leaded glass windows.  The local school was John E. Clark Elementary, a K-8 building.  We had very high test scores. </p>
<p>When we moved to the area shortly after the 1967 riots, and it was all white.  I mean 99.9% white when we moved there.  As time when on, a few blacks move in and the federal govt. started forced bussing in about 1976.  My school went from about 95% white to 50/50 white/black.</p>
<p>Well, that was all it took to ruin the school.  Our once great test scores which gave families a reason to move to the neighborhood, took a dive downward.  There were police and security guards in the halls.  White families stopped moving in and more and more black moved in.  Things just got worse and worse. I had to attend a private high school because the public school was too black, too dangerous and was a poor learning environment.  We finally moved out and got what we could for our house that dad had made payments on for 20 years.   Poor dad made nothing on the house because the social engineering by the federal government had ruined the neighborhood.  </p>
<p>We moved farther to the out-skirts of Detroit and again, for the third time, the area began to turn black.  We were broken into.  We moved again.  This time we moved out of the city to the &#8220;inner ring suburbs&#8221; and again it began turning black.  We moved again.  </p>
<p>Each time the pattern was the same.  The first blacks to move in were pretty nice, decent people with good jobs.  They were running from the bad blacks.  As time went on, the quality of the black families went down.  I remember one family was just awful.  They terrorized the entire neighborhood.  </p>
<p>My old Detroit neighborhoods are all pretty much trashed now.  What a shame we couldn&rsquo;t live in the neighborhood we grew up in and send our kids to John E. Clark Elementary.  My family was displaced by crime, violence and terror.  I believe Detroit is a prelude to what this entire country will be like in a few decades.  </p>
<p><br>
I read that when the government pays for abortions, the number of abortions among poor women goes up 25%.  When I see &#8220;religious conservative&#8221; on TV saying that the government shouldn&rsquo;t be paying for abortions, I shake my head and say, &#8220;don&rsquo;t they realize they are cutting their own throats?&#8221;  Am I the only person that feels this way?  Am I a bad person?  Some days I feel like the last man on earth with any common sense.  <br>
