<h1>Bono Reflects on &#8220;Shoot the Boer&#8221; Song</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sapa, Times (South Africa), February 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The song has been at the centre of a politically charged controversy in South Africa, where the firebrand leader of the ruling party&rsquo;s youth league is locked in a legal battle with a white lobby group over whether the song should be banned as hate speech. </p>
<p>The U2 frontman, who is in Johannesburg ahead of a Sunday night concert for the band&rsquo;s 360 Degrees Tour, said in an interview with South Africa&rsquo;s Sunday Times that struggle music like the &#8220;shoot the farmer&#8221; song has a place. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was a kid and I&rsquo;d sing songs I remember my uncles singing &hellip;   rebel songs about the early days of the Irish Republican Army,&#8221; he said, proceeding to sing a song whose lyrics spoke of carrying guns and readying them for action. </p>
<p>&#8220;We sang this and it&rsquo;s fair to say it&rsquo;s folk music &hellip;   as this was the struggle of some people that sang it over some time,&#8221; he told the newspaper. </p>
<p>But the rocker went on to say such songs shouldn&rsquo;t be sung in the wrong context. </p>
<p>&#8220;Would you want to sing that in a certain community? It&rsquo;s pretty dumb,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s about where and when you sing those songs. There&rsquo;s a rule for that kind of music.&#8221; </p>
<p>Talk radio and the Internet burst into discussion Sunday morning of whether the comments amounted to support for Julius Malema, the outspoken leader of the ruling African National Congress&rsquo;s youth league, or for Afriforum, the Afrikaner lobby group seeking to have Malema banned from singing the song at rallies. </p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s hate speech. They don&rsquo;t know our history at all,&#8221; said one caller to Talk Radio 702. </p>
<p>&#8220;He did not condone the singing of &#8216;Shoot the Boer&rsquo; in public,&#8221; said a comment on the Times&rsquo; web site. </p>
<p>Afriforum has taken Malema to court for publicly singing the song, which includes the lyrics &#8220;dubula ibhunu&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;shoot the boer&#8221; in Zulu. &#8220;Boer&#8221; is itself Afrikaans, the language descended from South Africa&rsquo;s Dutch colonisers, and translates as &#8220;farmer&#8221;. </p>
<p>But Afriforum argued in an affidavit that the song&rsquo;s meaning was much broader. </p>
<p>&#8220;The word &#8216;boer&rsquo;, in this context, is a derogatory word referring to farmers, whites and to Afrikaners in particular,&#8221; it said. </p>
<p>Malema&rsquo;s singing of the song generated heated debate last year in the wake of the murder of Eugene Terre&rsquo;Blanche, a white separatist leader who was allegedly hacked to death by two black workers on his farm. </p>
<p>Violence on farms is a divisive issue in South Africa, where a series of racially charged rural murders, with both black and white victims, have made headlines since the end of white-minority rule in 1994. </p>
<p>Bono, who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism on behalf of developing countries, has long been involved in South African politics. </p>
<p>U2 were part of the group Artists United Against Apartheid that raised more than $1 million for the fight against the white-minority regime in the 1980s, releasing a song that called for artists to boycott apartheid South Africa. <br/>
