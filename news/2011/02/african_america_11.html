<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walter [Wake Forest baseball coach Tom Walter] donated a kidney to Kevin Jordan, 19, after Jordan became ill from a disease called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis. Jordan, an African American, was undergoing kidney dialysis while in search of a donor kidney. His relatives were not matches for donation. Although his coach is white, Walter was a match. {snip}</p>
<p>African Americans have a much harder time finding donor organs and donor bone marrow. Nordstrom Inc. is running a campaign this month to raise awareness of the need for more African American marrow and umbilical cord blood donors. For every person who joins the &#8220;Be the Match Registry&#8221; as a potential marrow donor, Nordstrom will cover the $100 registry cost.</p>

<p>Talk about a feel-good moment!  I have no doubt that this coach considers himself touched by the angels for his act of Divine Diversity.  And the <i>LA Times</i> is, of course, only too happy to play along.</p>
<p>Wonder how often blacks donate their kidneys to Whites.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;African Americans have a much harder time finding donor organs and donor bone marrow.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Impossible.  Race is Only a Social Construct.  Everybody knows that.</p>

		<p>That man is a FOOL.  What if his remaining kidney goes bad?  What if one of his children or relatives needs a kidney?  Now his donated kidney will no doubt live a much shortened life, with a big chunk of it behind bars.  If blacks don&rsquo;t want to donate then let them die from their selfishness!  I work with mostly blacks and have heard them talk about not wanting a white to get one of their organs.  This crew CHEERED OJ being declared not guilty by the way!</p>
<p>Also, I have heard of whites donating kidneys to blacks in the past but can not remember an instance of a black giving up a kidney for a white.</p>

		<p>What a twisted, multi-culti fool. These are the kinds people who are destroying America with their &#8216;we&rsquo;re all alike&rsquo; attitude. How long before this demented white man sees this &#8216;fine young black man&rsquo; dealing drugs, smoking dope and running with the rest of the wild hooligans that have such a wonderful reputation. </p>
<p>And paying the $100 registration fee to encourage blacks to become donors? Purely ludicrous - you might as well spit in the wind. Perhaps they might have just a TAD better luck if they paid the BLACKS the $100; even then it will be a long shot to get them to actually DO it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Typically, people are more likely to find a donor match from someone of their own race or ethnicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if the writer of the article realizes that he has made a small, but very important, reference to the fact that blacks and whites differ from each other on a physiological basis.  It is something that even those in the medical profession don&rsquo;t like, or can&rsquo;t, talk about.</p>
<p>I thought there was no such thing as race!  These liberals would be hilarious if the matter weren&rsquo;t such a serious one.<br>

		<p>It is easily verified:</p>
<p>1. blacks being 12.5% of the population donate less than .20% of all organs gathered.</p>
<p>2. blacks make a constant demand on the organs donated by non blacks and cry racism if they don&rsquo;t get them.</p>
<p>3. So what&rsquo;s new here? Isn&rsquo;t this pretty much the way they operate with everything?</p>

		<p>The main reason blacks have a hard time getting organs is because they don&rsquo;t donate them. And this is mainly because they don&rsquo;t want whites to get them. Talk about self-defeating behaviour.</p>

		<p>Oh, really&hellip;how many times have I seen a black blood doner at the Red Cross when I was there donating? Once, that&rsquo;s how many. He was retired military (I talked to him), just doing the right thing. </p>

		<p>Other examples of foolish white charity efforts for black benefit:  Habitat for (black) Humanity; vacant lot clean-up in big city black neighborhoods; white supported orphanages with all black children; etc.  Do we ever see these things the other way around?  Would blacks ever support an orphanage for all white children?  Would blacks ever come into a white neighborhood and clean up vacant lots without being paid?  Would blacks ever build a house and give it to whites for free?  As a matter of survival, white people should learn to look out only for themselves.</p>

		<p>From a few discussions with Blacks, I don&rsquo;t believe that hatred of whites is the main factor in Africans not donating body parts. The blacks, that I spoke with, realized that other blacks would likely be the recipients. I gather that fear of supernatural influences occasioned by having an organ implanted in someone else&rsquo;s body is the main factor. This was something that the blacks hinted at, rather than stating directly.</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head. </p>
<p>Most Whites have lost all sense of survival for their race, (which was INTENTIONAL to begin with)&hellip;.. I see, read and hear it all the time. It is getting to the point I can even pick out a White person in a store, church, etc. that I KNOW would NEVER &#8220;offend&#8221; a person of color, but has no problem putting down and offending those of their own race.  It is to the point that I don&rsquo;t even want anything to do with most Whites knowing that they would consider me a &#8220;bigot, racist, hatemonger&#8221; and you name it. When in reality I consider THEM the haters and evildoers in our race.</p>

		<p>Because of bad experiences like the Tuskegee Experiment, many African-Americans distrust the medical establishment.  This might be wny they are reluant to sign donor cards.</p>
