<h1><a href="https://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-turn/2011/01/the_uncivil_left.html">The Uncivil Left</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Showing no concern for the new civility push that followed the Arizona massacre, a group of leftist activists from groups including Code Pink, Common Cause and jewel of liberal think tanks, the Center for American Progress, turned into a loud mob complete with Nazi imagery outside a conservative gathering in Rancho Mirage, California.</p>
<p>As the Daily Caller reported, over the weekend a conference sponsored by the Koch brothers featured conservative heavy weights such as House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.), Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Rush Limbaugh. The leftist groups were joined by a liberal law school dean and ex-green czar Van Jones. They decried the gathering as a nefarious conspiracy:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal here for the panel Sunday is to talk about the Billionaires Caucus agenda, its human impact and what can be done to restore the voices of ordinary Americans to the our political process,&#8221; explained Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause. &#8220;Our government is supposed to be of, by and for the people, but it has been hijacked by self-interested billionaires. We must take it back. &#8221; </p>
<p>Despite the hyperbole, the Koch conference doesn&rsquo;t sound so different from many off-the-record political conferences, including those held by the professional left. Shortly after the 2010 elections, for example, liberal groups converged on Washington D.C.&rsquo;s Oriental Mandarin hotel. The meeting, hosted by Democracy Alliance featured liberal leaders such as Van Jones, hedge fund manager Donald Sussman, and AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka. Michael Vachon, a George Soros representative, Peter Lewis, CEO of Progressive Insurance; and Fred Baron, the former president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America also attended.</p>
<p>{snip} However, the leftists&rsquo; main objection to third-party fundraising groups, namely that the donors remain &#8220;secret,&#8221; is curious since groups like Center for American Progress don&rsquo;t disclose their donors either.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also celebrated was the historical figure Guy Fawkes, whom the left routinely associates with anti-government violence.</p>
<p>According to an eye-witness who contacted me by e-mail, protesters shouted &#8220;traitors,&#8221; held signs that said &#8220;Koch Kills&#8221; and chanted &#8220;No justice, no peace&#8221; outside the hotel. </p>

		<p>The real problem is the perfidy of the news media. The public relys on the media to be their eyes and ears and ferret out malfeasance. Long ago the media was overtaken by the far left. I don&rsquo;t know how it happened but it did and any criticism of the left is not going to happen. If the fact that Van Jones was involved with this doesn&rsquo;t bring any attention, nothing will.<br>

		<p>I know precisely why this protest happened.</p>
<p>The reason is that the kook leftards on all their little kookosphere sites have all convinced themselves that the Koch Bros. are the secret Soros-like money men behind the Tea Party Movement.  Obviously, it&rsquo;s all projection   &mdash;   Since all their stuff is Soros astroturfing, then they can&rsquo;t conceive of the other side being anything different.  Therefore, they found two billionaire brothers in Wichita, who are pro-gay marriage, and whose money underwrites a lot of PBS programming, to blame all their problems on.</p>
<p>Personally, I fear for the Koch Bros.&rsquo;s safety.</p>

		<p>The foolish assumption is that the leftists will play by any sort of common rules.  Trying to negotiate with people who are convinced they are always correct always fails.  These tactics won&rsquo;t change.<br>

		<p>I am beginning to discern a strange sort of conspiracy theory neurosis at both ends of the political spectrum.  Leftists believe that there is a push for one world rule by the world bank, the G5 nations, whatever is left of the old Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergers, etc., while the right sees almost the same, but run by communists and Jews.  So they feel that whatever extraordinary measures they may take to suppress their real or imagined enemies is justified, because they are convinced of the other&rsquo;s plans to enslave and/or eliminate them.</p>
<p>Statistics show that whites are being marginalized in their home nations, indigenous lands, etc.  Whoever is doing that must be stopped, but if whites simply helped themselves by recognizing their intrinsic worth and demand parity and the right to exist, that would be enough.</p>

		<p><i>Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause says, &ldquo;Our government is supposed to be of, by and for the people, but it has been hijacked by self-interested billionaires. We must take it back. &rdquo; </i></p>
<p>From the Washington Examiner, <i>Common Cause has received $2 million from Soros&rsquo;s Open Society Institute in the past eight years, according to grant data provided by Capital Research Center. Two panelists at Common Cause&rsquo;s rival conference nearby   &mdash;   President Obama&rsquo;s former green jobs czar, Van Jones, and blogger Lee Fang   &mdash;   work at the Center for American Progress, which was started and funded by Soros but, as a 501(c)4 nonprofit &#8220;think tank,&#8221; legally conceals the names of its donors.</i></p>
<p><br>
In other words, money from billionaire George Soros and anonymous, well-heeled liberals was funding a protest against rich people&rsquo;s influence on politics.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve still got it wrong.  Neither of them control the other.  They are two arms of the same entity, working for the same cause, under the same ideological banner: the <b>governmedia</b>.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the left has been stung by the claims that<br>
they&rsquo;re puppets of Soros.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve responded in two ways: <br>
 1. With a counterclaim that conservatives are Koch brothers lackeys<br>
2. With a despicable smear that anyone who criticizes Soros is an anti-semite; see David Brock, Michelle Goldberg and the ADL. <br>

		<p>The Left wants to silence anyone who dares to disagree with their liberal pronouncements and refuses to buy into the liberal ideology.</p>
<p>Which is why I urge all readers to sign up and get a free Newsvine account   &mdash;   then post often under the various news articles offered daily. We have to make these people realize we also count. That our opinions DO matter.</p>

		<p>The mainstream media is collapsing at the speed of light.  You would think with all of the notions in the media of how horrible private property is that it would be a wonderful thing that the media is now being controlled by millions of website developers, bloggers, posters, etc.  So what&rsquo;s the problem?  I thought public ownership is a good thing?</p>
<p>Odd that organizations like the SPLC who bash private property and essentially praise communism operate on capitalist principles.  Capitalism is great!  As long as it&rsquo;s for them only apparently&hellip;</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly, that we don&rsquo;t need conspiracy theories. Sure, there are plenty of conspiracies out there, have been forever, will be forever, what&rsquo;s new? But a genuine American renaissance is something that Americans can do without &#8220;defeating the sinister ______s&#8221; (fill in the blank). Focusing on shadowy conspiracies gives them power over our minds, when they have in fact no power (else why do they stay in the shadows?) A Western man should be, is, above that. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you can keep your head when those about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting, too,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
