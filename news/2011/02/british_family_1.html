			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Becky Barrow, Daily Mail (London), Feb. 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Almost two thirds of parents who have one child say they are too poor to have a second.</p>
<p>The crippling cost of bringing up youngsters means the average size of a British family is &#8216;shrinking&rsquo;, a report claimed yesterday.</p>
<p>It found the average bill for raising a child from birth until the age of 21 is around £270,000.</p>
<p>From nappies to cots, shoes to dentists&rsquo; bills, new bicycles to the cost of school trips and after-school clubs, the costs are endless.</p>
<p>And this is before parents have embarked upon luxuries, such as foreign holidays and private education  &mdash;  which costs an average of £8,000 per term.</p>
<p>When asked why they were not going to have a second child, 58 per cent of parents with one child cited &#8216;money&rsquo; as the overwhelming reason.</p>
<p>Some 64 per cent of those with two children say they cannot afford to have a third.</p>
<p>Researchers warn: &#8216;The average UK family size could be set to shrink as the cost of bringing up a child spirals to £271,499.&rsquo; Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the average number of children born to married or cohabiting couples has fallen.</p>
<p>In 1971, such couples typically had two dependent children. The latest figures, from 2009, show they have an average of 1.7. The number of married or cohabiting couples who have one child has risen from 16 per cent in 1972 to 20 per cent today.</p>
<p>The report comes as families face the biggest financial squeeze since the 1920s. </p>
<p>The cost of living is rising faster than salaries, with state workers set for a two-year pay freeze if they earn £21,000 or more and private sector workers typically getting a two per cent rise.</p>
<p>Motoring costs are particularly high with record petrol prices and a 33 per cent hike in the average cost of comprehensive car insurance.</p>
<p>Louise Colley, mother of three-year-old twins, said: &#8216;When I had my scan and found I was having twins, I joked: &#8220;That&rsquo;s private school out of the window&#8221;. As a mum, I completely understand the financial pressures that parents are under. Nursery fees, in particular, are astronomical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The research by insurance firm Aviva was based on interviews with 1,000 parents with children under the age of 22. It divides the £271,499 total bill for raising a child into four categories.</p>
<p>These are &#8216;education&rsquo;, which includes anything from school trips to private school fees and university costs. The total bill is £66,938.</p>
<p>Next is &#8216;household services&rsquo;, which includes items such as internet connection, train fares and help towards a deposit on a child&rsquo;s first home. The total bill is £77,080.</p>
<p>The third is &#8216;clothing and food&rsquo;, which includes all nappies and prams, children&rsquo;s clothes, shoes and boots, as well as food and school dinners. The total bill is £69,332.</p>
<p>The final category is &#8216;leisure&rsquo;, which includes children&rsquo;s activities, pocket money, holidays and toys. The total bill is £58,149.</p>

		<p>The birth-rate figure of 1.7 is out of date as it has now surged to 1.9 - but that is thanks to immigrant births. Among white Brits it probably remains at 1.7 or below. In fact the birth rate among white British women has increased in recent years BUT paradoxically the number of white British babies born each year is still falling (although at a slower rate). The paradox is due to the fact that although the number of babies per woman has increased, the number of white British women in the fertile years is falling now that the last of the baby boomers has passed out of that category - the post war baby boom continued until 1968 when the birth rate began to fall sharply.</p>
<p>Anyway, I always tell young couples who want children but worry about the cost to go ahead and have them because they will manage somehow - and if they wait until everything is just right it&rsquo;ll be too late because it never will be just right. </p>

<p>While that might be true, it is not true for most.  And given that cultureless hedonists are usually liberal that may not be too bad of a thing.</p>

<p>While you are right that the time is never perfect, I do not blame them for waiting a year or two so the couple can send their kid to a private school if the need arises.  And maybe they can get assistance to manage in England; but if you are white and in the U.S. good luck.  You can get that public assistance money unless your kid is mixed or you live in a project in the ghetto.</p>

		<p>Yet Muslim immigrants on welfare can seem to afford to have kids by the litter.</p>
<p>Solution?</p>
<p>Ditch immigration, and no more foreign aid.  Put the money you&rsquo;re not spending on foreigners into a baby bonus programme for native whites.  Then those who want children will be able to afford all they can stand to spit out (and the breeders always manage to make up for the non-breeders, on average).</p>
<p>Give the white Brits this - at least they do think about whether or not they can afford to raise a kid on their own, unlike certain other groups we can think of, who don&rsquo;t seem to care about that.  When I see those CCF/Worldvision beg ads on the TV, all I see is a kid that never should have been born, and irresponsible parents who should be shot instead of fed.</p>

		<p>White people need to ignore the media propaganda about how much it costs to have children. I&rsquo;ve heard this nonsense for decades. I&rsquo;m 58, have two sons, 25 and 21, and my wife and I wish we had had at least four (4). Would it have cost very much more to have had four? No. Perhaps more meals of beans and rice. Perhaps two children per bedroom instead of each child having a bedroom of his own. Medical insurance would have been the same even if we had had a dozen kids. Besides, having additional children propels the economy!</p>
<p>These folks have managed just fine  &mdash;  </p>

		<p>So, &#8220;leisure&#8221; spending on children is almost as much as &#8220;education&#8221; and &#8220;clothing plus food&#8221;. Excuse me, but I think something&rsquo;s wrong here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leisure&#8221; spending for children should be set at exactly zero   &mdash;   okay, make it a bit more than that, but not much more.</p>
<p>If constantly upgrading to the latest game console has to be factored in the cost of raising children, of course children will be awfully expensive.</p>

		<p>Dear Spirit Wolf @#4</p>
<p>I suspect that you are being ironic, but if not, don&rsquo;t you think that our elites would be doing EVERYTHING they could (which is a great deal) to encourage indigenous British people to have children (and, correspondingly, everything to discourage the third-world immigrants, including the Muslims, from so doing), if that is what said elites REALLY wanted?</p>

		<p>With regards to comment number 1, many of my peers (20&rsquo;s-30) who are married really cannot afford to have kids responsibly and maintain a decent standard of living. </p>
<p>It is impossible to survive on one income and in these risky times, can I afford to allow my husband to be the only earner?  He is a software engineer and his job is hanging on by a thread  &mdash;  - they are just dying to hire someone on an H1B visa to replace him.  If he lost his job and I quit mine to raise a baby right now, where does that leave us?  </p>
<p>We did everything right  &mdash;   we did what we were told.  We followed the rules.  We desperately want to have a family but we do not see how that could happen responsibly right now.  So instead, we have a puppy  &mdash;   many of our friends are in the same position as well.  By the way I live in NYC where the cost of living if you are white or asian is astronomical.</p>

I would not want to shove a watermelon through my cervix.  Women don&rsquo;t get the choice.  And while I don&rsquo;t believe in monetary compensation (it isn&rsquo;t helping the Russians) for the act itself, I do believe that there should be a system in place that lets particularly late family starters get help.  Specifically through Exogenics and Genomics.  We cannot ever again depend on liberated white women to either remain racially loyal or &#8216;hold up their side of the bargain&rsquo; (safety and domestic provision in turn for 3 kids).  Not in a world where they can work to achieve independent means and breed with whomever they deign share their genes with, then dump them to move on.</p>
<p>John Bell In England,<br>
Have a care that those white mothers are not giving birth to brown babies.  It happens because women are native gene cuckolders as an evolutionary means to refresh bloodlines.  Ours are not stale (certainly not compared to the massivey inbred Pakistani and Somali peoples) but the fact remains that unless you can -prove- the parentage of the child, more white birth mums doesn&rsquo;t mean much and the statistics should be doubted until verified.</p>
<p>Spirit Wolf,<br>
The problem with &#8216;breeders&rsquo; of any kind is that they generally reduce rather than lift up the competitive IQ curve which makes for a lower left and a larger total percentage of dependent population in a highly competitive environment.  Great if you need cannon fodder to win a war.  Not so much if they occupy the same slot as the Indian or Pakistani or Horn Of African, creating &#8216;racial tension&rsquo; in blue collar positions.</p>
<p>We are on a downhill run in terms of total population curve vs. sustainable replacement here people.  Exhausted by a hard hundred+ years of industrial revolution we have depleted our cultural zeitgeist making one segment of us so insanely rich that they no longer relate to the rest of us at all.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can let them replace us.  But it does require that we be pragmatic (robots not more blue collar births, economic protectionist legislation and better genetics, not more poor, dumb, immigrants) in how we deal with much smalller populations overall.</p>
<p>Japan is a great example of a 128 million to 72 million paradigm shift way of looking at this as an opportuniity not a loss.  </p>
<p>They want their old people back on the job and will pay for it.  </p>
<p>They want their women out of the house after the kids are 8-10 and will make robots to play both nanny and elderly care giver in luring them.</p>
<p>They will collapse the retail sector&rsquo;s service quality (1960s level sales staffing) to go entirely internet based as a means to recover a huge resource pool of remissionablel trainees, useful elsewhere in the economy.</p>
<p>I would feel a _lot_ better about our chances if I saw the West taking the same high-road as technological and institutional solutions rather than self-defilement race mixing solution to population issues.</p>
<p>Rome imported her replacements and ended up sacked from inside her own borders for her troubles&hellip;</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why I only have one child.  I live in a majority-minority area (there&rsquo;s no jobs anywhere else) and after private school tuition (public schools? Are you kidding?), huge house payments to live in one of the remaining &#8216;safe&rsquo; areas and all the rest, there&rsquo;s nothing left over.  I would have liked to have 3-4 kids, but it&rsquo;s not in the cards.  Meanwhile, every illegal immigrant around me is pushing a baby stroller with 3-4 kids in tow, and that&rsquo;s no exxageration.  We are Rome in its last days, as #9 mentioned.</p>

		<p>Jay  &mdash;   My husband and I were in Babies &#8216;R Us the other day when we both took a day off work  &mdash;  of course the store was filled with Mexicans, pregnant and with several kids in tow.  Its amazing that they can afford to have so many kids while still managing to not work!   My husband and I were both astounded.</p>

		<p>We have one child, we live in a shoebox of an apartment (though thankfully it&rsquo;s in a good part of town), we live on one income.  We can&rsquo;t afford a second child ourselves.  Even if I could get a job, around here it&rsquo;d be minimum-wage.  Not only that, but I don&rsquo;t want anyone else raising my child, who has a developmental delay.  Bad enough he&rsquo;s in public school (long story there).</p>
<p>And my husband just paid off a car, so we have two cars that are paid for.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that if we weren&rsquo;t being robbed (via taxes) to support these freeloaders, we whites would be able to afford more children ourselves.</p>
<p>Kind of makes you think&hellip;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the problem is. If you can have 2 cars, there&rsquo;s no reason why you cannot have a second kid. Just calculate how much money is spent on a car, gas, repairs, insurance, etc.</p>
<p>Get rid of the second car, get a second baby instead.</p>
