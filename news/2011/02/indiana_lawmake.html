<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20110223/NEWS-US-IMMIGRATION-INDIANA/">Indiana Lawmakers Pass Immigration Curbs Like Arizona</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Comcast News, February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Indiana senate passed a sweeping immigration bill that echoes Arizona&rsquo;s tougher measures on illegal immigrants and despite opposition from some of the largest employers and business groups in the state.</p>
<p>The measure, passed on Tuesday night by a vote of 31-18, would allow state and local police to ask a person stopped for infractions like traffic violations for proof of legal residency if the officer has a &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; they may be in the country illegally.</p>
<p>Another provision would call for, with some exceptions, the use of English only in public meetings, on Web sites and in documents.</p>
<p>The bill still needs to be adopted by state&rsquo;s House of Representatives, where opponents say they will now turn.</p>
<p>The vote &#8220;was a key step in the legislative process,&#8221; the bill&rsquo;s author Sen. Mike Delph said in a statement, adding that the bill will &#8220;send a clear message that Indiana will no longer be a sanctuary for people who are in our state and country illegally because of our federal government&rsquo;s failure to act on illegal immigration.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I sincerely hope this law in Indiana get enacted. And I hope other states follow suit. It&rsquo;s easy for leftists to chant &#8220;boycott Arizona&#8221; and portay it as some sort of rogue state overtaken by extemists. But it&rsquo;s gonna be more difficult to say &#8220;boycott Arizona, boycott Indiana, boycott this state and that state&hellip;&#8221;  Stand up for AZ&hellip; have your own state to pass a similar law. </p>

		<p>If you click on the original article you will read, &#8220;Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce officials say the measure would have a chilling effect on business, particularly convention business.&#8221;  Nice to see the principles of sovereign rights, controlling our population and social benefits control takes a backseat to the need to fill the Indianapolis convention center.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll believe this when it goes through, but I hope it does. I would like to see a tsunami, a tidal wave of states enacting similar legislation. It will be hard for the Marxists to declare war on all 50 states, but of course they&rsquo;ll try.</p>

		<p>Excellent; though I doubt the impact will be much. Still, one must keep chipping away. Georgia is about to enact the same legislation. This recent situation isn&rsquo;t hurting the chances of it passing here: Just last week an illegal Mexican was arrested for drugs at the scene of another Mexican &#8216;domestic dispute&rsquo; where his friend, another [illegal] Mexican, stabbed to death two of his own three children to keep the [illegal] estranged wife and her new [illegal] boyfriend from having his [illegal] children. The second Mexican was released from jail &#8216;accidentally&rsquo; (he used fake ID&rsquo;s which confused the authorities - imagine that) and one week later blew up a house while making meth, killing his own [illegal] girlfriend&rsquo;s three small children, and hightailing it to Mexico.</p>

		<p>Should&rsquo;t having public meetings and documents in English be a given? This is the first time in the history of this country that another language is being given equal footing with our own. What a disgrace! Immigrants (as opposed to illegal aliens) of old, had to learn the language if they wanted to be a part of this country. Never did they force their native tongue on this country or demand that they be taken care of from birth to death as the bold lawbreakers of today do. But, this will continue as long as our leaders handle them with kid gloves. How about getting tough and ordering the invaders home - or prison?</p>

		<p>This is all worthless fraud. They need to enforce for PERJURY and IDENTITY THEFT (illegals purger themselves on every single w-4 form) and set 4 yr jail terms MINIMUM</p>
<p>Poof illegal immigration problem solved.</p>
<p>Instead, they will put them in county, hand them over to ICE, ICE will release them 5 feet on the other side of the border, and they will just STEP RIGHT BACK IN</p>

		<p>The State houses are where the action is on immigration, racial issues. This is where activists need to focus their energies, not on hopeless Libertarian Presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>The system is controlled and corrupt at the top - but new, local heroes are coming out and need our support like this Indiana Sen. Mike Delph</p>
