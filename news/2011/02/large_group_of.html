			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Lee Myers, KLAS-TV (Las Vegas), February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Border agents said Wednesday they arrested an unusually large group of illegal immigrants crossing through the western Arizona desert in what authorities said is proof that increased border technology is working.</p>
<p>Border Patrol surveillance video operators Friday morning spotted a group of more than 100 people walking just north of the Mexico border about 15 miles west of Lukeville, Ariz., Agent Eric Cantu said.</p>
<p>When agents responded, Cantu said they were able to arrest 22 people but the rest of the group scattered.</p>
<p>A helicopter team found much of the group hiding in thick brush, and agents arrested 106 additional illegal immigrants. {snip}</p>
<p>The 128 men who were apprehended have either been returned to Mexico or were jailed because of prior convictions.</p>
<p>The Border Patrol&rsquo;s Tucson sector typically sees such large groups of border crossers no more than once or twice a year, Cantu said. Illegal immigrants typically travel in groups of five to 15, he said, because larger groups are much easier to detect.</p>

		<p>Lemmie guess, a group of 500 were crossing at the same time but the agents were too busy with this group to bother to catch them.</p>
<p>Enforcement at the border is not going to work without INTERIOR enforcement. Every one of them knows if they can get 10-15 miles from the border, nobody will bother to catch them. </p>
<p>There are tens of millions of illegal aliens in the USA every day (in every state of the Union) and the press focuses on one group of 128 being rounded up in the desert.</p>
<p>Even when caught by local law enforcement, the Feds won&rsquo;t even take them for deportation. Obviously, this is not working.<br>

		<p>They&rsquo;re trying to get here before the REAL crackdown starts.  Word has spread that U.S. is starting to take illegal immigration seriously.  Still not nearly enough, but it&rsquo;s a start.  Our federal government needs to grow a backbone and start supporting the states with the most severe problem.  I suggest that Arizona send a bill to Obama, charging him $1000 for every illegal they have to deal with.  Federal government needs to fund enforcement of the laws they enacted on the individual states.  Now there&rsquo;s a novel idea&hellip;</p>

		<p>Make no mistake, I&rsquo;m glad to hear about this.  Knowing what I do about helicopters&rsquo; patrol endurance as a function of radius and minutes, I am still leary of pronouncing this more than a show catch.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am specifically reminded of a certain movie in which a certain criminal drug trafficker promised &#8216;major arrests&rsquo; and &#8216;cutting the drug trade in half&rsquo;, as means to make a Presidential administration look good enough to continue business as usual, under the table.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem here.  Because stopping the criminals at the border is a zero sum game in terms of what you win you give back immediately as a loss.  You throw the little fish back, they swim past the boat (or helicopter, as the case may be&hellip;) the next day, a different way.</p>
<p>We need to see measurable and _improving_ decreases in attempted illegal immigration, combined with self deportation of the existing population and most importantly, the ramp up of a replacement cheap labor force of indigenous peoples.  Until we hit zero immigration (legal or otherwise) and a return to self sufficiency.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s college kids working off a grant/scholarship, chain gangs looking for early parole.  Or robots that never get tired.  It won&rsquo;t be until we reduce this supposed &#8216;labor shortage&rsquo; as proof of control over corporate consumer greed, that we know we are winning.</p>
<p>Put another way: 100 people caught means 200 got by, using the BPs own statistical metrics.</p>

		<p>No doubt Obama will tell the border patrol to back off.  After all, they&rsquo;re deporting future Democratic voters.</p>

		<p>MEANWHILE! while the &#8220;authorities&#8221; were busy with this HUGE number of ILLEGAL ALIEN invaders, 20,000kg of drugs and hundreds more ILLEGAL ALIEN invaders safely crossed a few miles in one or the other direction (or both)&hellip;an all to common ploy used by the druggers and people smugglers and one which, apparently, the &#8220;authorities&#8221; have yet to catch on to.</p>

		<p>If we were not wasting billions of dollars on wars in Iraq etc,we might be able to build a border wall or fence that would keep these third world types from invading our country. I have totally given up on the lackluster policies of the federal government. re defending our borders.   Donald Kiernan</p>

		<p><b>I suggest that Arizona send a bill to Obama, charging him $1000 for every illegal they have to deal with.</b></p>
<p>Good luck with that considering it is Obama&rsquo;s DOJ that filed a LAWSUIT against the state of Arizona supporting the rights of illegal aliens over the rights of American citizens.</p>
<p>No change will occur until there is a change in government. </p>

		<p>7:  I agree we&rsquo;ve been in Iraq too long, if we should have been there at all.  But the costs of Iraq should not have ever precluded completing the border fence.  Under $7 billion, if that.  A lot for you and me, but chump change for an institution that takes in about $2.4 trillion in taxes and spends a lot more.</p>
<p>This story is precisely the reason why the USBP should be supportive of SB 1070 and other similar laws in other states.  While it is perfectly obvious, reading between the lines (not an original thought here) that the authors of SB 1070 knew that would be a waste of time to chase down every ole illegal alien, because ICE would say &#8220;let &#8216;em go,&#8221; the provisions in SB 1070 relating to certain kinds of illegals doing certain kinds of nefarious things (e.g. transporting illegal drugs, transporting terrorist ordinance, transporting an unsafe number of illegal aliens in a given vehicle, transporting underage girls for the purpose of prostitution), does draw the interest on other Federal agencies (DEA, HLS, DOJ), and would eventually put the onus on ICE to &#8220;deport&#8221; them (even in theory) once their Federal prison and/or state prison bids are through.</p>

		<p>I was watching a very old movie with Bob Hope in it. It was his usual corn ball stuff and involved Zombies.</p>
<p>Bod asked what a Zombie was and he was told they were mindless creatures of the walking dead without the ability to think on their own.</p>
<p>Bob said &#8221; Are you sure they are called zombies, I thought creatures like that were called Democrats&#8221; ?</p>
