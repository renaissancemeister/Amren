<h1>YSU Student Fatally Shot at Ohio Frat House</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas J. Sheeran, Washington Post, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A day after an admired college student was shot dead at an Ohio fraternity house and 11 people were injured, the governor, college officials and friends were hoping to find some explanation for the violence.</p>
<p>Jamail E. Johnson, 25, a senior at Youngstown State University was fatally wounded Sunday as he tried to separate two groups at a Omega Psi Phi fraternity house party. Authorities say there had been a dispute, two men had left the gathering and then returned and sprayed bullets into the crowd. Among the 11 injured was a critically wounded 17-year-old.</p>
<p>The two men were arrested on charges of aggravated murder, shooting into a house and 11 counts of felonious assault, said Youngstown police Chief Jimmy Hughes. Their names were not released, pending further investigation. The chief said only that they are in their early 20s and from the Youngstown area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The shooting occurred off-campus at a two-story brick house in a neighborhood of once-elegant homes, many of which are now boarded up. The house party had been bustling with 50 or more people early Sunday, the police chief said. Capt. Rod Foley said Johnson apparently was trying to separate two groups when he was shot.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
Members of the university-sanctioned fraternity lived at the house, though Cooper said the fraternity does not own it. He said that after the shooting, Johnson&rsquo;s fraternity brothers were &#8220;very solemn, very alarmed, very hurt.&#8221;</p>

						<p>Omega Psi Phi (ΩΨΦ) is a fraternity and is the first African-American national fraternal organization to be founded at a historically black college. Omega Psi Phi was founded on November 17, 1911, at Howard University in Washington, D.C.. The founders were three Howard University juniors, Edgar Amos Love, Oscar James Cooper and Frank Coleman, and their faculty adviser, Dr. Ernest Everett Just. {snip}</p>
<p>On November 23, 1911 in Thirkield Hall, Love became the first Grand Basileus (National President). Cooper and Coleman were selected to be the Grandkeeper of the Records (National Secretary) and Grandkeeper of Seals (National Treasurer), respectively. Eleven Howard University undergraduate men were selected to be the charter members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since 1945, the fraternity has undertaken a National Social Action Program to meet the needs of African Americans in the areas of health, housing, civil rights, and education. Omega Psi Phi has been a patron of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) since 1955, providing an annual gift of $50,000 to the program. Omega Psi Phi is a National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) member.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Each Chapter administers Internationally Mandated Programs every year:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Social Action Programs  &mdash;  All chapters are required to participate in programs that uplift their society. Many participate in activities like: voter registration, illiteracy programs, mentoring programs, fundraisers, and charitable organizations such as American Diabetes Association, United Way, and the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Health Initiatives  &mdash;  Chapters are required to coordinate programs that will encourage good health practices. Programs that members involve themselves in include HIV/AIDS awareness, blood drives, prostate cancer awareness, and sickle cell anemia awareness programs.</p>
<p>Voter Registration, Education and Motivation  &mdash;  Coordination activities that promote voter registration and mobilization.</p>
<p>NAACP  &mdash;  A Life Membership at Large in the NAACP is required by all chapters and districts.</p>

		<p>Is there another race that is as predictable and consistent as the Black race? Whether it is Monrovia, Detroit, Soweto, Philly, Port-Ah-Prince, St.Louis or a frat house in Ohio, the Black man never fails to show what he really is.</p>
<p>I look forward to my daily visits to thugreport for more good news from the people that Dr. Albert Schweitzer called &#8220;our little brothers&#8221;. They never fail to entertain me with their antics.   </p>

		<p>Governor, I have the answer for you, and you don&rsquo;t have to dig for it or search for the reason for the violence.  Whenever you have a large group of blacks in one place, or attending ANY kind of event&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;you get violence.  Guaranteed.  I guess the reason you have to scratch your head and &#8220;search for the reason&#8221; is because you like all PC imbeciles, have to search for some reason - any reason - rather than  acknowledge the REAL reason.  Blacks.  It&rsquo;s who and what they are.<br>

		<p> They want to know what caused the violence? How about, &#8220;Blacks have a tendency to extreme violence and poor impulse control?&#8221;</p>
<p> Blacks? Why, the article said nothing about race, did it? As we all know, fellow AmReners, it didn&rsquo;t have to. &#8220;Jamail Johnson&#8221;? Neighborhood with &#8220;once-elegant homes,&#8221; many now boarded up? The more the mainstream media tries to hide the truth, the more obvious it becomes.</p>

		<p>Well, I guess this proves that I&rsquo;m &#8220;non-racist,&#8221; but when I read about this story in the local paper, because the MSM studiously avoids mentioning race when it suits their purposes, and  because I usually do picture whites in stories like this, merely because whites are still the majority in this country, I assumed it involved whites. However, when I just found out here on AmRen that the frat house was black, I was not the least bit surprised. In fact, if anything, I was surprised that I initially pictured whites as the perpetrators. Guess I still am racist after all.</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a recorded case of the locals in a white town opening fire at a white fraternity party? Yes, I&rsquo;m sure there have been a lot of fistfights, but I&rsquo;m not aware of someone breaking out the AK-47 against the white fraternity members. Having grown up in an area with a lot of blacks, it was not unusual to see a fair number of the grown men with the Omega brand on their arm. </p>
<p>The media is going to extreme pains not to portray this as black on black crime. Unless you are familiar with Omega Psi Phi, you probably haven&rsquo;t heard that they are a black fraternity. You can imagine that Jesse and Al are working overtime to try to figure out a way to blame whitey on this one. </p>

<p>Not surprising that a clueless schmuck like John Kasich can&rsquo;t add the obvious two and the other obvious two in front of his face to make the obvious four.  I guess it&rsquo;s a requirement for Republican Governors of Ohio to be awful on race   &mdash;   Remember Bob Taft practically shaking in his boots after the Cincinnati riots in 2001?</p>

<p>Offhand, there were cases where blacks killed white students at Kent State a couple of years ago. Actually one incident was in a dorm on Kent state and another murder took place in &#8216;downtown&rsquo; Kent.</p>

		<p>I am 45 years old and I graduated from Youngstown State University about 5 years ago with my second degree.  The college is situated in the urban center of a dying town like Detroit, mostly minority now as most of the white people have long since moved out</p>
<p>I did not see any problems with the black students on the campus, in fact the whites and the blacks generally seemed to keep to themselves.  The one thing that stuck in my mind is that while the white students went to class and looked physicality and mentally exhausted from studying and working, the black students rarely were in class and acted like it was a party every day.  They constantly laughed hysterically, dressed in official NBA and NFL shirts, the girls had their hair and nails done just right, and they were having the time of their lives.  I am sorry to hear about the shooting however, regardless of the race of the shooters and the victims.</p>

		<p>I have noticed that when ignorance gets involved with two people agreeing to disagree, the one who cannot get their point across with educated debate, will resort to this type of behaviour. I have noticed this seems to happen so much more with blacks. Education is free in this country, however you need to make an effort to learn.Maybe if it was not free and blacks had to pay, to go to college instead of getting grants because their black, they might try to apply themselves to become educated.</p>

		<p> Naturally, there was no mention of either the shooter&rsquo;s name or the fraternity by our Controlled Media. I was lead to believe that these were the same type white fraternity boys who &#8220;raped&#8221; the brutalized black stripper at Duke. The truth will set you free indeed. </p>

		<p>About three weeks ago, a similar incident took place at the University of Rochester (considered a &#8220;new Ivy&#8221;). Supposedly the frat party had a &#8220;gangsta&#8221; theme.  Both victim and alleged perp are black.</p>

		<p>I could yawn at the knowledge of a group of blacks fighting. However, I&rsquo;m still stuck at &#8216;black fraternity&rsquo;. That still indicates a group of male college students, right? Are there enough blacks in college to create a fraternity? Perhaps the African AF-leet Free Ride fraternity.</p>

Thanks to affirmative action, &#8220;diversity&#8221; scholarships, and athletic scholarships, there&rsquo;s lots of blacks at college. There&rsquo;s a lot fewer who actually graduate, of course, but they generally hang around for at least a year or two.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if it was an all or mostly-white fraternity where this occurred, they&rsquo;d probably take the occasion to point that out as if it were a bad thing. They certainly wouldn&rsquo;t imply that it&rsquo;s just a matter of a few bad eggs.</p>

		<p>I was Treasurer for a real fraternity at a large university.  I was in charge of contracts for renting out our frat&rsquo;s house.  </p>
<p>Whenever a black fraternity rented, the custom, nay, the necessity, was to include a clause requiring at least two private security guards.</p>
<p>We also had to explicitly declare that all risk of damage, theft, criminal activity, etc. was laid upon the President of the black fraternity and its members and that we were absolved of any and all liability.</p>
<p>We found an ounce of contraband lying in the corner after one such party, probably ditched or forgotten in a moment of fear or paranoia.</p>

		<p>#20, [my fellow] Georgia Resident<br>
True, there are actually many blacks enrolled in colleges (notice I didn&rsquo;t say &#8216;attending&rsquo;). Actually, my comment was meant to be full of sarcasm. I live in close proximity to UGA, and just LOVE the Monday reports of how many &#8216;UGA Foo-baw players&rsquo; were arrested over the weekend.</p>
<p>As you say, with the full-out assault on white college applicants through black-only scholarships, diversity drives and SAT score manipulation there are a lot of blacks and other minorities, including illegals, registered in U.S. colleges.  I shudder to think of what goes on in black fraternities. Ewwww.</p>
