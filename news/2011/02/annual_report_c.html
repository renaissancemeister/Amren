			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Monitor, February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Even as the Southern Poverty Law Center points out that the number of US hate groups has topped 1,000 for the first time, the civil rights organization is receiving flak from critics on the right who say an overbroad definition of &#8220;hate&#8221; vilifies innocent people and stifles vigorous debate about issues critical to America&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Tension erupted recently between the SPLC and a slew of Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota (who tops the SPLC&rsquo;s &#8220;militia enablers list&#8221;), who protested the SPLC&rsquo;s listing of the conservative Family Research Council as a hate group. The SPLC said the Family Research Council is knowingly pushing falsehoods about gay people.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Montgomery, Ala.-based SPLC, which became well-known for civil lawsuits that weakened the KKK and other white supremacist groups, is careful to note that organizations on its list don&rsquo;t necessarily advocate violence. Its definition of a hate group and &#8220;ideologues&#8221; includes groups and people who suggest that an entire group of human beings are, by virtue of class characteristics, &#8220;somewhat less,&#8221; says Mark Potok, the editor of the SPLC&rsquo;s Intelligence Report, which published its findings Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Driven by fears about changing demographics, the first black president, and a harrowing economy, &#8220;[the] three strands of the radical right  &mdash;  the hatemongers, the nativists and the antigovernment zealots  &mdash;  increased from 1,753 groups in 2009 to 2,145 in 2010, a 22% rise,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;That followed a 2008-2009 increase of 40%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neo-Nazi-like hate groups grew by nearly 10 percent since 2009, to 1002; anti-immigration vigilante groups grew by 3 percent, to 319; and antigovernment &#8220;Patriot&#8221; groups  &mdash;  defined as &#8220;conspiracy-minded organizations that see the federal government as their primary enemy&#8221;  &mdash;  grew by 60 percent, to 824. {snip}</p>
<p>Potok notes that the slowdown in the increase of the number of so-called &#8220;nativist&#8221; anti-immigration groups is probably related to the enactment of tough new measures against illegal immigrants, such as in Arizona. But while legislators in states such as Virginia and Montana have proffered a slew of antifederal legislation this year, the mainstreaming of hard-right issues hasn&rsquo;t dramatically &#8220;taken the wind out of the sails&#8221; of Patriot groups, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the SPLC&rsquo;s investigations and studies are used by some law enforcement agencies concerned about domestic terrorism, its overall work, its critics on the right say, has taken on an overtly political dimension by giving ideological cover for attacks primarily on white conservatives and by turning the word &#8220;patriot&#8221; into a euphemism.</p>
<p>In December, 22 Republican lawmakers, among them Speaker Boehner and Representative Bachmann, three governors, and a number of conservative organizations took out full-page ads in two Washington papers castigating the SPLC for &#8220;character assassination&#8221; by listing the conservative Family Research Council as a hate group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They really need to explain what they mean by hate and how in the world [Loyola economist Thomas] DiLorenzo or myself could be associated with something called hate,&#8221; says Livingston [Donald Livingston, an Emory University philosophy professor]. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t hate anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January, Mr. DiLorenzo was called out on the House floor for being a member of the League of the South. Mr. DiLorenzo says he&rsquo;s not a member, but Loyola University in Baltimore is investigating.</p>
<p>Livingston, who describes himself as a former supporter of the SPLC, questions whether the organization&rsquo;s &#8220;hate group&#8221; reports are primarily tied to its fund-raising activities. He also notes that many of those listed by the SPLC take it as a &#8220;badge of honor,&#8221; much as tea party activists took to wearing &#8220;I&rsquo;m a right-wing extremist&#8221; T-shirts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he says, &#8220;it&rsquo;s time for some reality check on this sort of thing, beginning with the very concept of hate. The SPLC has a political agenda and they vilify people, that&rsquo;s what they do. There&rsquo;s very little in the way of an empirical examination of groups that might pose a threat to civil order. There&rsquo;s almost nobody left in the Klan, so what they do is they find respectable groups or high-profile people and they say, &#8216;X is linked to Y, who is linked to a hate group.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what McCarthy did.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The SPLC can never win the argument&hellip;the argument being would it be a great benefit to the Native Born White Majority to be race-replaced with high-fertility post 1965 nonwhites. And this is what drives all of uneasiness and conflict in America 2011. More and more Native Born White Americans are comming to the conclusion that it is not a great benefit. The know the obvious truth of this from experience with nonwhites. So what&rsquo;s the SPLC to do? Well the only option left for the SPLC is agitate for brutal police state repression for the rapidly growing population of Native Born White Americans who will not give their consent to being race-replaced by high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>The SPLC is an anti-white hate group whose mission is hasten the process of race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority. We must publicly identify the SPLC as a hardcore racist organization. Do not let the SPLC define the terms of the debate.</p>

		<p>I never thought I would see the day when patriotic Americans (including veterans) would be described as &#8220;nativist&#8221;, &#8220;rightist&#8221;, xenophobic, racist, and much worse&hellip;..ONLY&hellip;..and I say, ONLY&hellip;..because they believe Federal law SHOULD be enforced. No wonder some of our patriots feel the US government is their enemy.</p>
<p>This country is a nation of laws and without the law, all that remains is tyranny. Mr. Obama continues to amaze me with his willingness to describe EXISTING laws as &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221;. As I understand our system of government, ONLY the supreme court of the US can make that determination. His role is ONLY to enforce the laws on the books&hellip;..including the ones he does not personally agree with. (Yes, he has refused on many occasions.)<br>

That&rsquo;s what McCarthy did.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The difference is that Hollywood -was- largely overrun by extremely left leaning members or associates of Communists as later historical investigations and Russian archival material proved.</p>
<p>Now, McCarthy is long dead, the Cold War with him and yet the same attitudes remain as a cultural iconoclasty that seeks to destroy anything representative of white folk ways and rights to majority rule in the fashion of our culture.</p>
<p>And &#8216;the opposition&rsquo; remains associated almost entirely, _openly_, now with one group of people in control of both ends of the thought-crime and thought-control propaganda wing of our government as media.</p>
<p>For the latter is really what the SPLC has become.  An organizational mouthpiece for a quite obvious agenda with judge, jury and reparational powers necessary to condemn freedom of association and speech.</p>

		<p>I think I can clarify the words HATE and RACISM for the readers.</p>
<p>RACISM is anything a white person says about anyone who is not white that doesn&rsquo;t raise the non white up to the top of a pedestal. While putting down any white thoughts about the matter.</p>
<p>HATE is anything a white person says, thinks, or does that does not glorify the non white in some way.<br>
You can not care for mashed potatoes and prefer french fries. You can prefer a blue shirt to a yellow one BUT if the non white isn&rsquo;t your number one choice that decision on your part is what is called HATE, not preference, HATE or RACISM.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s got it almost right.  While the SPLC does indeed assign a hate label to groups by association, they are far more involved with demonizing conservative groups simply because they do not sign on to their open borders, pro-black, pro-non-white and gay agendas.</p>
<p>Crossing swords with the Congress might be a costly mistake for the SPLC and it could well cost them much funding.  This is the first time these people have been nationally criticized by so many of those in power.</p>
<p>Rumor has it their funding is down due to the economic situation. I look for layoffs to occur as the economy continues its downward spiral.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a man who has had sex with a man, and for that some people hate me very much. When I got physically hurt because of that, it was wrong. When I got made fun of - it wasn&rsquo;t a picnic but it wasn&rsquo;t something to get all worked up about. My mother taught me about sticks &amp; stones and she was right. </p>
<p>Time passed, I move to a more liberal city, I become a reader of amren (with all that implies), and now I get hate from liberals. Not something I enjoy, but they can fuss and fume all they want. </p>

		<p><i>Tension erupted recently between the SPLC and a slew of Republicans</i> </p>
<p>The SPLC doesn&rsquo;t have any power that the Repubs didn&rsquo;t help give them. If they hadn&rsquo;t been The Stupid Party, they would have seen this coming a long time ago.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;They really need to explain what they mean by hate and how in the world [Loyola economist Thomas] DiLorenzo or myself could be associated with something called hate,&rdquo; says Livingston [Donald Livingston, an Emory University philosophy professor]. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t hate anybody.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Notice the very weak form of argumentation here. He&rsquo;s automatically going on the definsive, by insisting that he &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t hate anybody&#8221; rather than pointing out that the SPLC is a money-grubbing con game and in fact, a &#8220;hate group&#8221; itself. A defensive position is naturally a weaker position than an offensive one. Once again The Stupid Party plays directly into the left&rsquo;s hands.</p>

		<p>The interesting thing is, I&rsquo;m not sure that the SPLC is even aware that their public image is on a downward trend. I mean, they hear the criticism, but they may just tell themselves that it&rsquo;s just a bunch of &#8220;hate&#8221; being spewed by their opposition. That&rsquo;s what it seems like. A bit like overly zealous religious fanatics.</p>

		<p>Until pretty recently, all i felt was disgust and loathing for islam and muslims, that is rather rapidly turning to the true definition of hate. This is daily being enhanced and reinforced by seeing the treatment given to non muslims, sometimes in the news, and all to often in person. Islam MUST be stopped and the stOOpid blacks that convert in prison or otherwise in the U.S. (especially the pushy, mouthy, beligerent, rude and disrespectful black women) have no real idea what ruthlessly enforced sharia would do to their way of life. I DO!</p>

		<p>SPLC&rsquo;s definition of a hate group is a gathering of two or more non Jewish white people. That&rsquo;s about it in a nutshell. A pronouncement made by a bunch of nuts who are desperately trying to remain relevant, who say their main purpose is to fight bigotry and hatred, when all they seem to do is spread it. Because if you don&rsquo;t agree with their Marxist ideology, they&rsquo;ll do everything in their power to smear your reputation. Especially if you are white and not a Jew. THEY are the ultimate hate group, and more and more people are catching on. Even their title is a joke. Their total assets at the end of 2003 was $156 million.</p>

<p>I occasionally read some of their &#8220;Intelligence Reports&#8221;. And, although, some of the biographical information on the people is accurate enough its when they start making the case for &#8220;hate&#8221; that things fall apart. Just like Livingston says, very few of the people listed on the site have any real ties to anything one could consider a &#8220;hate group&#8221;. It usually reads like a case of &#8220;they&rsquo;re a friend of a friend of someone who once thought they knew someone who might have been in the klan&#8221;. </p>
<p>The irony is that, as a young lawyer, one of Dees first cases was defending a klan member in court. That stopped the day he realized he could make more money with his fund-raising hustle. They don&rsquo;t call it the Morris Dees Retirement Fund for nothing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the $PLC&rsquo;s definition of a &#8220;hate group&#8221; is anyone opposed to the political agenda of its <i>donors</i>.<br>

<p>Let me see if I understand this correctly. If you disagree with cultural/class Marxist ideology then you are a hater and belong to a hate group. </p>
<p>Since when is the US a socialist country?</p>
<p>We had class Marxism in the USSR, which failed to spread worldwide as the middle class proved to difficult to mobilize.</p>
<p>Class Marxism was replaced with cultural Marxism and the tools of cultural Marxism is multiculturalism, egalitarianism and mass immigration. </p>

		<p>The real target of the cultural left is the young.  Otherwise, it&rsquo;s simply preaching to the choir, since mature people have their values firmly entrenched.  <br>
Anyone who believes that Christianity and white people are the scourge of humanity and Islam and the darker races the saving grace is free to follow the left.  </p>

		<p>HATE: </p>
<p>any White man who wants a job, any White employer who hires another White, any White church that doesn&rsquo;t hire all black staff and preacher, </p>
<p>any White fraternity or sorority that doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;actively reach out to communities of color in order to diversify their membership and help overturn the ugly and painful segregation past,&#8221; </p>
<p>any White girl who denies that her beautiful White skin is &#8220;consent&#8221; to Diversity sex, any White girl who yells &#8220;Help&#8221; or &#8220;Rape&#8221; or &#8220;Stop&#8221; when being forced to accommodate the Diversity Treatment&rsquo;s social justice through the formerly Whites Only womb, </p>
<p>any White who doesn&rsquo;t not &#8220;atone for the sins of segregation by holding myself accountable to people of color for my unearned White privileges,&#8221; </p>
<p>any White who constantly changes the TV channels because they refuse to get their news and weather from blacks and is offended by all the blacks and hispanics surrounding the Whites on commercials and shows, any White how notices that in most advertising, either TV, web, or print, the Whites are included as a definite minority with &#8220;others,&#8221; especially in ads showing children, any White girl who sees those ads and thinks how hideous her future will be when she&rsquo;s not allowed to have only White friends, </p>
<p>and finally, HATE is simply whatever Dees, Potok, Cohen, Beirich, Jealous, Foxman, Matthews, Maddow, O&rsquo;Donnel, Olbermann, and Stewart say it is.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hate&#8221; is the contemporary misallocation of emotions of anger and us/them outgroup hostility basic to the evolution of the Norther European races.  The &#8220;us/them&#8221; dichotomy is basic human nature.  Heidi and Morris are not guides to what is natural or good.  </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of gold in that there hate&hellip;if there was no money to be made off of so called hate you would find these people working another scam somewhere else. Carney hucksters rate higher than these people on my scale.</p>

		<p>I have a question about these so-called hate groups. Do these hate groups close our factories down and move them to China and Mexico??  My hometown had five such factories. Do these hate groups destroy big cities and fill up big prisons?? Are these hate groups the reason we are hated in the Middle East and why our nation is bankrupt right now?? Just the facts ma&rsquo;am!</p>

		<p>1 Anonymous:  No, but I do predict that the SPLC and ADL will start &#8220;sniping&#8221; at each other pretty soon, because they&rsquo;re all trying to hustle a decreasing supply of money from the same donor base which doesn&rsquo;t have as much to give anymore.  The row over the Armenia issue opened the first schism.</p>
<p>You know the SPLC has jumped the shark when both the Christian Science Monitor and John Boehner question you.  Next thing you know, David Frum and David Brooks might start saying publicly that the SPLC just might be &#8220;misguided.&#8221;  That would mean the dam is breaking.</p>
<p><i>ts definition of a hate group and &ldquo;ideologues&rdquo; includes groups and people who suggest that an entire group of human beings are, by virtue of class characteristics, &ldquo;somewhat less,&rdquo; says Mark Potok, the editor of the SPLC&rsquo;s Intelligence Report, which published its findings Wednesday.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhat less?&#8221;  Does this mean the SPLC will have a new category, of &#8220;somewhat hate groups?&#8221;</p>

		<p>So essentially people are just waking up to what your average Amren poster has known for many, many years?</p>
<p>Next thing you know the GOP will be holding up &#8220;The Color of Crime&#8221; as a shining example of why multi-racialism has failed!  Hey, I can dream.  At least until A3P starts putting up candidates.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The interesting thing is, I&rsquo;m not sure that the SPLC is even aware that their public image is on a downward trend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole left seems to find themselves in that fog. After years of living in their echo chamber they&rsquo;ve lost not only the ability to argue with any coherence but they are oblivious to the danger around them. Now I know why so many of them are into New Age. It&rsquo;s not going to be pretty when reality catches up to them. They&rsquo;d better hope that that reality is us and not the multicult paradise they&rsquo;ve been waiting for. </p>

		<p> While the SPLC&rsquo;s investigations and studies are used by some law enforcement agencies, its overall work&hellip;has taken on an overtly political dimension by giving ideological cover for attacks primarily on white conservatives and by turning the word &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; into a euphemism.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>A &#8220;euphenmism&#8221;?  Oh, really? Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t mean to say &#8220;pejorative&#8221;?</p>
<p>And that first comment about law-enforcement agencies using SPLC&rsquo;S material is worthy of further exploration.  It is one of the most disturbing aspects to me   &mdash;   that they are given access and  treated as a semi-official branch of the government, when  they are in fact nothing of the kind.  I am sure that many of those law-enforcement officers and organizations don&rsquo;t even realize that this is just a private organization grinding its own axe.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that even God HATED!  If one would read their own Bibles and UNDERSTAND their Bibles from day one, then one might find these gems of &#8220;hate&#8221; from God and WHOM/WHAT, HE hated. </p>
<p>So, I consider myself in good company &#8220;when I have justified hate&#8221;. Also remember God&rsquo;s ways (thinking) and our ways are not the same in the least. I get a kick out of these so-called conservatives and the lefties when they call any racially aware White person who speaks out some truths a &#8220;hater&#8221; and a &#8220;racist&#8221;&hellip;..Let them rant and rave all they want because I happen to know their tactics and their agendas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a man who has had sex with a man, and for that some people hate me very much. When I got physically hurt because of that, it was wrong.

Why do you find it essential to declare your sexuality right off the bat? Just because you claim to be &#8220;conservative&#8221;, it makes it okay with us? No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
