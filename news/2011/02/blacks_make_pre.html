<h1>Blacks Make Presence Felt at CPAC</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon L. Bratcher, Times Herald (Norristown, Pennsylvania), February 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blacks made their presence known at the 3-day Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held Feb. 10-12 in Washington DC. Though fewer in number than their white counterparts, they served as speakers and panel discussion experts and they were listened to by thousands who embrace the conservative political philosophy.</p>
<p>Herman Cain, a businessman, radio talk show host, and &#8220;black American patriot,&#8221; drew several standing ovations from the packed-out audience in the Marriott Wardman Park. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cain said that &#8220;the liberals don&rsquo;t think that we can think for ourselves.&#8221; Not only has he embraced conservative thinking, he is actively planning to run for president on the Republican ticket in 2012.</p>
<p>Congressman Allen West, R-Fla., stated that he is a conservative black politician because there needs to be a cap on federal spending and a balanced budget amendment.</p>
<p>William Owens, the Vice-President for Product Development of The Tea Party Review pointed out during a panel discussion sponsored by World Magazine that the new &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; movement encompasses people from all races and walks of life. {snip} Two African-American gentlemen in the audience confirmed that they, like Owens, have not only attended, but organized and spoken at Tea Party events, adding that &#8220;the liberal media ignored the fact that we were there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wright [Crystal Wright of conservativeblackchick.com] stated that she finds it frustrating that some of her friends are surprised that she can call herself a conservative. She stated, though, that &#8220;blacks are conservative on many issues, such as family values, and church, and lowering taxes.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wright mentioned that the GOP seriously needs to work at &#8220;seeing us in the room&#8221; and not dismissing blacks as irrelevant. Language needs to &#8220;be respectful and people need to watch what they say&#8221; as well. But no matter what, &#8220;Voting must be issue-driven,&#8221; she concluded and not based on personalities, perks, or past history.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are statistics that are not passed around by the media today  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s time to take a good hard look at what&rsquo;s going on.&#8221; One fact that Ms. Wright stated was that unemployment in some urban areas ranges from 30-50 percent now, whereas it was around 19 percent back in the Reagan era.</p>
<p>Eric Jessup, an attendee, joined in the conversation and pointed out that historically it has been the Republicans that have helped the black community in the best ways. He does not believe that the Democrats have done the black community any good &#8220;holding them hostage to social welfare programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wright quoted Walter Williams, radio commentator, as summing it up thus: &#8220;the social welfare programs have done what slavery couldn&rsquo;t do to blacks  &mdash;  destroy the family.&#8221; She pointed out that the breakdown of the family leads to dependency on the government.</p>
<p>Jessup added that there is still some inherited resentment in the black community towards voting Republican, because of past deeds.</p>
<p>Often blacks were also taught to be negative about America. {snip}<br>
In the last panel discussion of the conference, political strategist Margaret Hoover stated that it&rsquo;s time to stop playing &#8220;the game of identity politics,&#8221; separating people into interest groups, treating ethnicity above humanity.</p>

		<p>Needless to say, a guolt-ridden white GOP leadership will profusely apologize and redouble their efforts to be more &#8220;inclusive.&#8221;  Meanwhile, 95%-100% of all blacks will continue to vote Democrat.  </p>
<p>Republicans have been pandering to this kind of pressure for 40 years, ever since President Nixon instituted an early form of affirmative action.  It has availed the party nothing, with or without Michael Steele at the helm.    </p>

		<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t misinterpreted as advocating an open tent policy for the GOP, because I&rsquo;m not doing that at all.</p>
<p>My question is to these Blacks: why should the GOP focus on Blacks? Blacks are maybe 13% of the population and even less of the electorate. What good would it do? It&rsquo;d make more sense to court Hispanics, who are not only numerous but important in several key states.</p>
<p>But then again I&rsquo;d rather the Republican Party be one with a spine and represent the interests of Whites.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as much as &#8220;blacks making their presence known&#8221; at CPAC than black &#8220;conservatives&#8221; being shoved up onto the stage and in front of the podium far faster than they would if they were white.  It&rsquo;s really a nice hustle if you can get it, but you have to be black first   &mdash;   All you have to do is feign a little conservatism, and the Republidorks, the conservadorks and the Stupid Party will make you an instant star.  But if you follow through on your natural philosophy, that being liberalism, and pursue it through the Democrat Party, you&rsquo;re going to have to wait in a long line, and pay a lot of dues, before you truly become someone.</p>

		<p>The only way Republicans can get the black vote is to become the party of welfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The social welfare programs have done what slavery couldn&rsquo;t do to blacks &mdash; destroy the family.&rdquo;  Black people mistakenly believe they had a two parent system in Africa before slavery and somehow white people ruined it.  Africans before slavery had a situation where the mother would raise the child sometimes along with other women in the tribe with the father having little involvement, many times going off and impregnating other women.  Essentially what is happening today is the re-Africanization of black people.  Laws have been relaxed and the social stigma of out-of-wedlock children and single parents is largely gone leaving black people free to live their own way, not by European standards.  Despite what black people want to believe there was more family unity during slavery than in Africa.</p>

Politically, &#8220;black conservatives&#8221; are a nullity. They are maybe 1 percent of the entire US population. And when you subtract out the ones who are Democrat race hustlers in Republican clothing, you&rsquo;re probably left with one tenth of one percent. Get two thirds of blacks (about a tenth of the US population) to vote for conservative policies on welfare, affirmative action, and immigration (just for a start), and we&rsquo;ll take notice. But given that even minimal welfare reform provokes wails of indignation from the black community, and affirmative action is held even more sacred by them, I&rsquo;m going to venture a guess that we aren&rsquo;t going to be seeing a tide of black conservatives in the future.</p>

<p>8o% of African-American children are born out of wedlock. Blacks have the the highest rates of abortion, incest, domestic violence and drug use.</p>
<p>And yet I continually hear talk radio hosts whine that blacks belong in the GOP because they have &#8220;family values&#8221;.</p>

<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>You mean like passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964?</p>
<p><i>82% of Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 versus only 64% of Democrats. Furthermore, a few years later, it was Republican Richard Nixon who first put teeth behind affirmative action.</i></p>
<p>Remember &#8220;Sheets&#8221; Byrd? </p>
<p><i>Most dogged in opposing the Civil Rights Bill was West Virginia Senator and future Democratic majority leader Robert Byrd.  Senator Byrd&rsquo;s fourteen hour filibuster was the longest in senate history.  The filibuster led by Yellow Dog Democrats ran for 10 million words over 534 hours filing up 63,000 pages of the Congressional Record.</i></p>
<p><i>She stated, though, that &ldquo;blacks are conservative on many issues, such as family values, and church, and lowering taxes.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Then why do they continue to overwhelmingly vote like old lefty 60s Whites?</p>
<p>Yeah, like, <i>What Have You Done for Me Lately?</i></p>

		<p> The pursiut of the minority vote is hopeless unless the Republicans support bigger goverment with more handouts for everyone, Minorities being lower income love handouts and will vote for the highest bidder.<br>
 The best bet for the republicans is to take the hispanics and throw as many as can legally be deported out of the country. Even that wont save us as their birth rate will  simply replace us. What to do about that is to subsidise whites to have more children.</p>

<p>That sounds like a message the Democrats desperately need to hear.</p>
<p>=======================</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it like it is. The GOP has chosen to field some affirmative action candidates. It won&rsquo;t get them any votes. It will only be a headache as those candidates use their position to advocate the same identity politics that Hoover has just decried.</p>

		<p>Well, to the GOP, not only are they irrelevant, they vote overwhelmingly for the Democrats. I mean, 80+ percent. They are forever lost to the GOP.</p>
<p>The GOP would be much better served trying to get white women to join them and widen the majority they have with the white males in the country. White males are the biggest voting segment in America but you wouldn&rsquo;t know it with how marginalized they are. Once white males who don&rsquo;t make 6 or 7 figures a year tune out from politics because the GOP isn&rsquo;t serving their interests the<br>
GOP is through. They won&rsquo;t have anybody who&rsquo;ll vote for them!<br>
See California for a perfect example of what happens when &#8220;minorities&#8221; take over and the white people drop out of the system. <br>

		<p>&#8220;I mean, 80+ percent.&#8221;<br>
It&rsquo;s more like 90+ percent, at least in presidential elections. When one of their folks is running as a Democrat, black support can run over 95%.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GOP would be much better served trying to get white women to join them and widen the majority they have with the white males in the country.&#8221;<br>
If the GOP wanted to have an issue that could unite both white men and white women, they would publicize the incredibly high black on white (as opposed to white on black) crime rates, and the similar trend that Hispanics follow. Tough on crime is the perfect issue for white voters. White men want to see justice proportional to the crimes committed, and white women want their children to be safe from criminals. It&rsquo;s an issue that has worked even among overwhelmingly liberal whites in such places as New York. And while publicizing the Willie Horton case provoked howls of indignation from the left, it did indeed help win George (H.W.) Bush the election in 1988.</p>
<p>If I were a Republican candidate in 2012, I would point out the high crime rates of both blacks and Hispanics, and the fact that current government policies are making sure that there will be more of them in the future. I would point out to white women that in a future where their children are a minority, they cannot expect any justice from a colored government (justice for whites is spotty today, even when we are over three fifths of the population), and will likely be disarmed by said government when trying to defend themselves. I guarantee that if someone argued the point well, and didn&rsquo;t back down, he could get 80% of white women to vote for him (and an even higher percentage of white men). If, in 2012, whites make up 70% of the electorate (not an unreasonable expectation, since we are on average older and more likely to be citizens than nonwhites), that alone would get him at least 50% of the vote. He could probably pick up a few votes among Asians, who are none too fond of blacks either, with such an appeal. And he could establish a congressional mandate to radically reform the nation&rsquo;s immigration, welfare, and citizenship laws, as well as perhaps amputate lost territories, and in so doing save a white majority in at least the greater part of the country.</p>
<p>This is all a nice fantasy, of course, but expecting courage, resolve, or even mere competence from the Republican leadership is a fool&rsquo;s hope. They will likely continue with lame stunts like electing incompetent black men to party leadership positions, and hero-worshipping any black who says that marginal tax rates on the wealthiest people should be lowered.</p>

<p><br>
The Republicans HAVE been pandering to blacks, and the white ones are sure to blame Democrats for the woes of blacks  &mdash;  not the blacks themselves.  The only people in popular media to excoriate black culture are successful blacks themselves  &mdash;  from Bill Cosby to Walter Williams to Thomas Sowell.</p>
<p>The Republicans  &mdash;  who are winning more and more white votes as a condition of the Democrats losing working class whites  &mdash;  should try and eliminate immigration so that whites remain a majority.  Blacks always vote for whatever the government will give them.  The GOP is living in Neverland if it believes Thomas Sowell is a sign of things to come from the black community.</p>
