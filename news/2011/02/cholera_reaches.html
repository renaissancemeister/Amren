<h1>Cholera Reaches New York, Kills Two Children in Dominican Republic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The cholera outbreak that originated in Haiti has now made its way to New York City  &mdash;  thanks to a lavish Dominican wedding that seems to keep making headlines.</p>
<p>New York City officials confirmed that three New Yorkers contracted cholera while attending a 500-guest wedding at an exclusive Casa de Campo resort. The wedding served contaminated lobster bought near the Haitian border. Dominican officials have said the lobster was not cooked properly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A medical epidemiologist for the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told The New York Times Saturday that all three people who were infected last month have recovered.</p>
<p>The water-borne disease, which causes severe bouts of diarrhea and vomiting, could be fatal if left untreated.</p>
<p>Dr. Sharon Balter says the city typically sees an average of one cholera case per year. In less developed Haiti, where clean water is tough to come by and medical care is spotty, more than 4,000 people have died from the disease and hundreds of thousands of others have been sickened by it since it first appeared in the country in October.</p>
<p>In the Dominican Republic, the death toll rose to three this past weekend after two Haitian children died during a supposed religious ritual, authorities said. Dominican health care officials said a pastor urged the kid&rsquo;s parents to bring them to his church, where he said he could cure them with a ceremony, rather than take them to the hospital.</p>
<p>Four other children diagnosed with the disease were rescued from the church, which is in a rural community in Puerto Plata, north of Santo Domingo, officials said. The pastor, known only as &#8220;The Prophet,&#8221; remains on the run, said a statement from the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 300 cholera cases have been confirmed in the Dominican Republic.<br>

		<p>Sometimes I wonder if the good Lord causes all these disasters, plagues and the resulting deaths in third world countries just to try to compensate for the birth rate of violent,lesser quality species in a vague attempt to save the world from such rapid overpopulation of them. You know, just to give the rest of the world a bit of a fighting chance. And we&rsquo;re still losing.</p>

		<p>I recently saw a history film of German citizens working to clear away debris from their shattered city after the bombardments of WWII.  They were in a long line - men and women - working BY HAND to clear chunks of concrete and bricks, each handing the heavy pieces to the person on his/her right, finally depositing them in trucks that would take them to a designated place for dumping debris.  If you know anything at all about postwar Germany, you know the entire nation was demolished, as was London - yet, the Germans and Brits picked up the mess piece by piece, cleared it, and built anew.  WHY hasn&rsquo;t anything like that happened in Haiti???  I&rsquo;ve never seen citizen one doing one blessed thing to help clear away the serious wreckage from the earthquake, and as a result, death and disease are still rampant there after over a year.  It really doesn&rsquo;t take much to see that there definitely IS a difference between blacks and whites!  The whites are willing to work to clean up their area and build something decent.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t.</p>
