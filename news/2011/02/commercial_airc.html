<h1><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=12980959">Commercial Aircraft Deaths Worldwide Up 15 Percent</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ABC News, February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Deaths on commercial aircraft worldwide rose 15 percent last year while the overall accident rate involving Western-built jets fell to an all-time low.</p>
<p>Those figures were released Wednesday by the International Air Transport Association, a trade group for the world&rsquo;s airlines.</p>
<p>The group said 786 people died in 23 separate accidents last year, up from 685 deaths in 18 fatal crashes in 2009. The figures include all kinds of jets and turboprops operated on commercial flights but don&rsquo;t include private or military aircraft.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most common cause of accidents remained planes leaving the runway during takeoff or landing. Many incidents involved wet runways, or too much speed.</p>
<p>IATA said there was one serious accident last year for every 1.6 million flights operated with Western-built jets compared with one for every 1.4 million flights in 2009. It said 2.4 billion people flew safely on 36.8 million jet and turboprop flights last year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Accident rates were lowest in the former Soviet republics and North America, followed by North Asia and Europe. Rates were higher than the world average in the Asia-Pacific region, Middle East-North Africa and Latin America-Caribbean.</p>
<p>The highest rate was in Africa. IATA said African airlines accounted for 2 percent of worldwide passenger traffic but 23 percent of serious accidents.<br>

		<p>In this regard, I have heard the complaint, &#8220;We can only afford old russky planes&#8221;.  </p>
<p>However,<br>
&#8220;a study by the Interstate Aviation Committee concluded that the flight safety of most Soviet made types of aircraft is no worse and, in some cases, is better than that of their Western equivalents. &ldquo;Much more significant is that mainly small, poorly regulated fringe carriers fly these aircraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The high accident rate in sub-Saharan Africa is thus primarily a result of poor safety standards and lax supervision, not operation of Eastern-built or older aircraft.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t blame it on the Russkies, Mbongo.</p>

		<p>NO, No Way, this has to be a mistake.</p>
<p>I thought blacks invented the airplane, the jet engine, the GPS, the 40 ounce beer bag, so how could this be possible? It doesn&rsquo;t even make sense. I thought the black mind was the highest form of intelligence on the planet?<br>
Please recheck The Facts, there must be a mistake here.</p>

		<p>From the Worlds Funnies Aircraft Accident Video file is the <br>
Congolese airline with the huge door in the back that the pilot<br>
accidently opened while in flight. He landed and went back<br>
to the cargo to escort the 200 passengers off the plane<br>
and found no one.</p>

		<p>The simple fact is that black Africans are at the top in many areas.</p>
<p>Worldwide they top the crime rates, the unemployment rates, voodoo practice rates, VD rates, illiteracy rates, rates of famine and starvation, and highest inflation rates. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The highest rate was in Africa.&#8221; Why? Do the rubber bands keep snapping or are they letting gorillas fly the planes?</p>

		<p>WE are so quick to critisize and be critical of black genius yet when the truth is right before our eyes we deny the gift we have in these strong and brave black minds.</p>
<p>To see their genius with your own eyes I would suggest checking out on You Tube the item labeled ( kenyan aircraft ), there you will see what these minds are capable of and your laughing may stop.</p>
<p>(This Post Is Total Sarcasm)<br>
But check out Kenyan Aircraft on youtube and get ready to start laughing.</p>

		<p>Why do you think the Air Force is the whitest branch of the US military? Because even affirmative action can&rsquo;t convince people  to put multimillion dollar planes in the hands of incompetent pilots. </p>

		<p>Anyone who gets on a plane with an African (American or otherwise)at the controls will not get any sympathy flowers at their funeral from me.  That one clearly goes in the &#8220;Well What Did You Think Was Going To Happen?&#8221; file.</p>

<p>According to this book, Africans could fly without the need of airplanes&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;or at least they could back before Massa done stole that knowledge from them and turned them into the lousy pilots, aircraft mechanics and air-traffic controllers that they apparently are today. </p>
