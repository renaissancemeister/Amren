Representative Peter King (R-NY) have joined documentary filmmaker Ken 
Burns, a noted apologist for blacks, in a bid to get a posthumous pardon
 for the first black heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Johnson 
(1878-1946). Earlier efforts to arrange a pardon for Johnson&rsquo;s 
conviction for violating the Mann Act have been unsuccessful, with one 
bill stalling in Congress just last year. However, Johnson is a hero to 
many blacks and to the most truckling sort of whites, so there is a good
 chance President Obama will grant a pardon. During his lifetime many 
Americans considered his a career a standing insult to whites   &mdash;   which 
makes him a particularly appealing candidate for amnesty.

        <p>Jack Johnson, who was born in Galveston, Texas, but later 
moved to Chicago, was the original loutish celebrity athlete. In the 
early 20th century, when white supremacy was still the norm, he taunted 
his opponents both in and out of the ring, and boasted about his endless
 fornications with white women. He was the first black man ever to be 
allowed to fight for the prestigious heavyweight championship, which he 
won from Tommy Burns in 1908 in Sydney, Australia. In a particularly 
cruel fight, he not only insulted his opponent, but held him up several 
times when he was about to go down so he could punish him some more. </p>
        <p>Johnson&rsquo;s claim to the title was disputed, however, because 
Burns had been declared heavyweight champion following the voluntary 
retirement of the undefeated champion, James Jefferies. Many people 
considered Burns something of a fake because he had never fought 
Jeffries.</p>

        <p>The call went out for a &#8220;Great White Hope&#8221; to regain the 
title for the white race, and in 1910, former champion Jeffries came out
 of retirement for what was widely billed as &#8220;the fight of the century.&#8221;
 Jeffries said he accepted the challenge &#8220;for the sole purpose of 
proving that a white man is better than a Negro,&#8221; but he had not fought 
in six years and had to lose 100 pounds to get back to fighting weight. 
After Jeffries hit the canvas twice in the 15th round and conceded the 
match, there were race riots in more than 50 cities, in which 23 blacks 
and two whites were killed. Many riots started when angry whites 
attacked spontaneous public celebrations by blacks. Some whites were so 
upset by the outcome of the fight that in 1912 they persuaded Congress 
to ban the interstate distribution of boxing films that showed Johnson 
beating a series of white opponents. Southern detractors threatened to 
lynch the champion if he ever returned to Dixie.</p>
        <p>This, then, was the background to Johnson&rsquo;s prosecution under
 the Mann Act. The act, passed in 1910, got its name from its chief 
sponsor, Congressman James R. Mann (R-IL). The statute authorized 
federal prosecution of anyone who transported a woman across state lines
 &#8220;for immoral purposes.&#8221; Congress claimed that its authority to regulate
 interstate commerce could be used to stop the white slave trade.</p>
        <p>The act was part of a series of religious and Progressive Era
 reforms aimed at civilizing American society, and the city of Chicago 
took part enthusiastically in this effort. Johnson, however, continued 
to flaunt his insatiable sexual appetite, especially in the aftermath of
 his victory in &#8220;the fight of the century.&#8221;</p>
        <p>In an era when anti-miscegenation laws were still on the 
books in many states and firmly enforced in the South, Johnson 
scandalized the country by marrying not one, but two white women in 
rapid succession (all three of his wives were white). His first marriage
 was to New York socialite Etta Terry Duryea, who had divorced her first
 husband, an automobile manufacturer, before taking up with the boxer. 
The newlyweds&rsquo; turbulent relationship ended in less than two years when 
Etta committed suicide by shooting herself. Johnson had probably been 
beating her and she was said to be depressed by his infidelities. </p>
        <p>By then, Johnson had already taken up with a 24-year-old 
white prostitute named Lucille Cameron, whom federal authorities hoped 
to recruit to testify against Johnson in the first-ever prosecution 
under the Mann Act. She refused to testify and Johnson married her   &mdash;   
just three months after his first wife shot herself.</p>

        <p>Johnson, who was paid $225,000 for his fight with Jeffries, 
traveled the country with his new bride and another prostitute, Belle 
Schreiber, who had left a brothel to join the entourage. This tour 
spurred federal prosecutors back into action, and they charged Johnson 
with transporting Schreiber from Pittsburgh to Chicago for immoral 
purposes. From the start there were claims the charges were trumped up 
and racially motivated, but a jury found Johnson guilty on seven 
separate counts, and he got the maximum sentence of a year and a day. 
Johnson fled the United States for Canada, disguised as a member of a 
barnstorming Negro baseball team, and later went to Paris. The outbreak 
of the First World War broke up the party and Johnson left France as a 
man without a country. </p>
        <p>After traveling to various places, Johnson, who had by now 
run through all his money, agreed to defend his title against a 
challenger from Kansas, Jess Willard. The championship fight between 
Johnson and &#8220;the Pottawatomie Giant&#8221; took place on April 5, 1915 before a
 capacity crowd at a racetrack in Havana, Cuba. It was a brutally hot 
day with the temperature over 100 degrees. At six feet six inches, 
Willard was one of the tallest heavyweights, and he used his height and 
reach to great advantage, knocking out Johnson in the 26th round. 
Photographs show the defeated champ lying on his back on the canvas, 
shielding his eyes from the blazing sun with an outstretched, gloved 
hand. Although Johnson continued to box professionally, he never 
regained the title. </p>

        <p> Johnson eventually tired of exile and turned himself in to 
the authorities in July 1920. He served a year in Leavenworth, and 
returned to Chicago on his release. Reduced to supporting himself by 
working at carnivals, he insisted he had thrown the fight with Willard. 
He claimed he had a deal with federal officials to drop the Mann Act 
charges if he took a dive, but that they had double crossed him. </p>
        <p> A close examination of the film of the title match belies 
this myth. The fight was decided by a knockout after 26 punishing 
rounds. Johnson managed to stay even until the 20th round, but then he 
clearly began to tire. When Jess Willard was asked about the claim that 
the match was fixed, he replied, &#8220;If he was going to throw the fight, I 
wish he&rsquo;d done it sooner. It was hotter than hell out there.&#8221; The 
knockout punch can be seen in a YouTube clip, and has every appearance 
of being a solid hit. Most experts agree that Willard won the title 
legitimately. Nevertheless, Johnson&rsquo;s claim gained great currency among 
blacks, and was printed as fact in such black newspapers as <em>The Chicago Defender.</em> </p>

        <p>The malicious-prosecution and fixed-fight myths were further legitimatized by a 1967 Tony-award-winning play, <em>The Great White Hope,</em>
 which was loosely based on Johnson&rsquo;s life. James Earl Jones played 
&#8220;Jack Jefferson&#8221; on stage and in the screen adaptation made in 1970. 
Both versions took liberties with the facts and sanitized much of 
Johnson&rsquo;s unsavory character. Unlike the belligerent Johnson, 
&#8220;Jefferson&#8221; is a largely sympathetic figure exploited by white society. 
Appearing at the height of the civil rights era, the story was a 
romanticized liberal indictment of state-sanctioned discrimination. 
Jefferson is a flawed protagonist, not unlike Othello, whereas the real 
life Johnson was a heel. The play won a Tony award and Mr. Jones 
received an Academy Award nomination for the movie performance, leading 
many people to accept the Hollywood moonshine as fact. It would be much 
simpler for President Obama to pardon the fictional character than the 
real man. </p>
        <p>Johnson, who was often cited for speeding and reckless 
driving, died in an automobile accident in 1946. His apologists claim he
 had driven off in a fury after he was refused service at a segregated 
lunch counter in North Carolina, and ended up crashing his car. In 
April, in its report on the efforts to have Johnson pardoned, the 
Associated Press repeated the myth that he was buried in an anonymous 
grave. In fact, there is a large monument at the former champion&rsquo;s grave
 in the Graceland Cemetery in Chicago. Two of his three wives, the 
tragic Etta Terry Duryea and, his last wife, Irene Pineau, are buried 
next to him. The prostitute Lucille Cameron divorced Johnson on grounds 
of adultery 22 years before his death and is not buried in the same 
plot.</p>
        <p>I predict this most recent attempt to rehabilitate Johnson 
will succeed. After all, he is just the sort of black person we are 
supposed to admire: In his prime, he could beat any white man in the 
ring and he debauched untold numbers of white women. He was the 
prototype of today&rsquo;s foul-mouthed athletes who laugh at the very idea of
 sportsmanship. If, on top of all this, we can be persuaded that 
vicious, envious white men sent him to jail on false charges we have the
 perfect hero for our times. Gestures like this cost nothing, and Mr. 
Obama will have a grand opportunity to lecture us all on racism again. <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" /> </p>

		<p>Some of these old fights you might see on film wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed today by any boxing commission. In the old days middleweight fighters could fight heavyweights if they felt tough enough. Nowadays they have more regulations for reasons of safety. Johnson&rsquo;s great &#8220;triumphs&#8221; were against medium weight boxers and other lesser types. He himself was knocked out by white boxers. The Jeffries fiasco is a bad joke yet gets presented as another great victory for Johnson. It&rsquo;s all just another propaganda rewrite of history as part of the culture war. McCain has nothing else to do?  </p>

As a boxing fan and a student of its history, I&rsquo;m not sure that Johnson deserves either villification or deification. He certainly wasn&rsquo;t as sordid as Tommy Morrison (great-grand nephew of John Wayne) who rose to prominence in the early 90s, got caught in possession of cocaine and firearms, failed a drug and HIV test, and then retreated from the spotlight. And then, of course, further down the trough you have Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>The period in question was of course the last one in which the term &#8220;race riots,&#8221; meant that principally white people were inciting violence. The term means something entirely different today. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how Ken Burns is a &#8220;black apologist&#8221; as the author describes him (unless liking jazz makes one an apologist). However, I do think that Johnson was unfairly persecuted. I am, like most readers, personally opposed to miscegenation in my own life and for my family. But I do not think one should legislate their personal morality concerning what two consenting adults prefer to do in private. I do not usually play devil&rsquo;s advocate on this forum, but this article seems a little bit too vindictive. I suppose this comment will be vetted out. </p>

		<p>Hirsch, the point is not that Johnson was unfairly persecuted (he was) or that he was a piece of trash (he was). The point is simply that this will be used as another &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; about how evil Whites are, about how saintly blacks are, and about how White women want nothing more than to miscegenate with blacks but evil White men don&rsquo;t want them to know about how superior blacks are.</p>
<p>Of course this ridiculous piece of Historical Retconning will get through. What more can you expect from a country whose god is a plagiarizing, whoremongering, defiling liar whose only real achievement in life was to be a tool for Lenninites?</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t congress just seal his criminal records for 50 years. After that we could install a made-in-China statue of him next to Mike King&rsquo;s monument. </p>
<p>Black heroes are apparently scarce to non-existent, so we shouldn&rsquo;t waste any opportunity to manufacture male role models for kids who don&rsquo;t know who their fathers are.</p>

		<p>This story seems pointless to me. No one has ever claimed Johnson was a soft, sweet man. He earned a living by fighting, and never apologized for his vices.<br>
 The author believes that Johnson is some sort of inhuman monster just because he was black.Many white fighters lived less than exemplary lives, and yet escape this authors wrath.<br>
Johnson was a rough, larger than life character who lived in a rough era. <br>
I&rsquo;m a subscriber, but sorry guys, this article serves no purpose other than creating a forum for the authors misplaced anger.</p>

		<p>To Hirsch (3#):</p>
<p>I respectfully disagree; a sleazy cokehead like Tommy Morrison is nowhere near as bad as the vile Johnson, a wifebeater who sadistically humiliated some of his outclassed opponents in the ring. It was sickening to watch Ken Burns&rsquo; adulatory documentary portray this lout as a lovable rogue.</p>
<p> One of his most despicable acts was his lie that he threw the Jess Willard fight. Millions of blacks and p.c. white liberals actually believed this tripe, causing great pain to Willard, a decent man though a limited fighter.</p>

		<p>This article is very irrational. Jack Johnson was a fantastic boxer. Secondly, we have to look at the times that he was living in. </p>
<p>Unlike today where many Blacks are a GIANT nuisance and menace to society, during this era, White on Black violence and other callous attitudes toward Blacks were commonplace. Whites had no problem in aggressively and arrogantly engaging in prideful bigotry toward non-Whites. Moreover, such behavior was legal.</p>
<p>Lasty, his private sexual liasons with consenting women who were adults (again consenting and adult are the key words here) were his business and no one elses.</p>

		<p>He certainly looks like the type of black athlete who is full of himself that nowadays young white boys are expected to admire and emulate. He has that gaudy, &#8220;trying to hard to be a big man&#8221; look in his picture in the car. If he&rsquo;d been born 100 years later he&rsquo;d be shrouded in expensive, attention-seeking clothes, gold teeth and bling bling jewelry. </p>
<p>It is interesting to see actual blacks from that era and their true stories. It puts into question some of the ideas that whites were holding blacks down, and that blacks suffered from lack of self-esteem.</p>

Boxing is, as Larry Merchant once observed, the sport of the dispossessed. There have been fighters with college degrees (Marco Antonio Barrera, the Klitschko brothers) but for the most part, if the sport is not dominated by whites, it should be nothing to fret over. In the first half of the twentieth century Jews dominated the sport. Benny Leonard and Barney Ross, for example (Max Baer was not Jewish, contrary to popular opinion). Much like their role in organized crime, Jewish boxing prowess was a one to two generation phenomenon. They eventually assimilated into the greater culture. If blacks want to gloat over possessing a surfeit of fistic violence, let them.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s most erroneous assumption in this piece is that blacks in contempary society care one way or another. Aside from &#8220;scholars&#8221; (scare quotes are necessary since we&rsquo;re talking about people like Michael Eric Dyson)the memory of young blacks and boxing dates back no further than Muhammad Ali; even Joe Louis is going too far into the past.</p>
<p>Last year the boxer Edwin Valero (who sported a prominent tattoo of Hugo Chavez on his chest) stabbed his wife to death and committed suicide. Before him, Carlos Monzon murdered his wife and died in a car crash. Johnson deserves neither a pedestal nor the pillary.</p>
<p>My main qualm is with living blacks who consume a disproportionate amount of entitlements and education benefits, not with dead black men who lived in a time when there was genuine racism, rather than the race hustling we have today before us in their midst.</p>
<p>I thought I would be the lone dissenter on this post, but it appears others sense we have much bigger fish to fry, re: affirmative action and unchecked immigration. I thank Amren for allowing this free exchange, whereas opponents such as Tim Wise have taken to disabling their comment sections.  </p>

		<p>I find Jack Johnson to be a very engaging figure (the photo says it all)&hellip;I&rsquo;ve read part of a very good book about him, which gives a good picture also of race relations and attitudes in the early 1900s, &#8220;Unforgivable Blackness,&#8221; by Geoffrey Ward. </p>
<p>If whites had half the spunk Johnson had (openly going with white women in the early 1900s? Wow&hellip;either very brave or very foolish!), we wouldn&rsquo;t be in the state we&rsquo;re in. Few of us posting here have been courageous enough to publicly violate the racial conventions of our own time as Johnson violated the racial conventions of his time, and it&rsquo;s very likely that our failure to be as brave as Jack Johnson was is one reason why our &#8220;movement&#8221; has been so ineffective to date. I give the man his due.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Also, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that part of his failure to bow and scrape was from the fact that he grew up in Galveston, Texas, where as a child he hung out in his neighborhood with a lot of white kids&hellip;racial attitudes in the port city were apparently unusually relaxed for the era, and he didn&rsquo;t absorb the usual black behaviors required then.</p>
<p>For awhile I was reading that book while also reading &#8220;Until Proven Innocent,&#8221; the excellent book about the Duke lacrosse team case&hellip;reading those two together gives a vivid picture of the astounding racial change in the U.S. in the last 100 years.</p>

		<p>I despise Jack Johnson. But Hirsch &amp; the other commenters are right. Johnson was no worse than a number of other highly successful boxers - of various races. I doubt a white boxer of similar fame and behavior in that era would have been pursued with the relentlessness legal authorities used against Johnson. That said, I oppose any pardon or cleanup of his record. He was singled out because he was a taboo breaking black, but he still got what he deserved.</p>

<p>Where do you get your facts? If you look at the newspapers of those times (unconcerned about PC and other lies) you can see that black-on-white crime was a major problem. No, not as problematic as today, but still a great problem. </p>
<p>Even Abraham Lincoln was attacked by a gang of blacks as a young man.</p>
<p>Bernie:</p>
<p>You are being intellectually dishonest. I am sure you understood Dale&rsquo;s point. Yes, there have always been criminal elements in the Black community past and present. However, the point of the article is about Jack Johnson and the era he lived in.</p>
<p>Anyone who is being honest would acknowledge that Johnson resided in an America much different from today in which there was a notable level of hostility against Blacks, including those who did not deserve such callous mistreatment.</p>
<p>Trying to divert the topic to Black on White crime against Abraham Lincoln does not change the facts of history and the point that many posters are stating in regards to the extreme, myopic and quite frankly, pointless article written by the author.</p>
<p>On another note, I have read a number of magazines and newspapers from the early 20th century (apparently based on your post you have to) then you would know firsthand that many publications routinely, openly  and unabashedly used the N word, and referred to Blacks as savages, childlike, apes, buffoons etc&hellip; Including the supposedly more liberal ones or as you refer to them, PC publications. They are not that difficult to find. If this is what you call being PC then I have to strongly disagree with you. </p>

		<p>Hirsch, my good man, at the top you said you were against race mixing for yourself and your family. The impression I get is you&rsquo;ll take care of this by yourselves. You won&rsquo;t try to influence other whites to do the same. You won&rsquo;t need the help of other whites to get your wish. I have to ask you to be fair-minded about what I say. The global historical experience shows ethnic groups are the usual way of accomplishing racial separation. The typical experience is that you need to do it with other people.</p>

		<p>Those of you who are attacking the author are missing the point. It&rsquo;s not like he went through historical archives and dug up the story of a black boxer just to be mean. The author wrote this article to counter a foolish decision by two self-hating whites (Sen. McCain and Rep. King) that would make a &#8220;hero&#8221; out of someone who was not one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like the comments about Michelle Obama&rsquo;s looks. Michelle is not a terribly unattractive woman, at least when compared to other black women (although I certainly consider her less attractive than the average white woman). But she gets a lot of negative comments about her looks from conservatives - because and only because the controlled leftist media are desperately trying to convince us that she&rsquo;s the most beautiful woman in the history of the universe. The negative remarks about her appearance are simply a reaction to the pro-Michelle hysteria coming from the left side of the political spectrum. </p>
<p>The negative comments about Jack Johnson the boxer are being made for the same reason. Someone said that he deserves neither the pedestal nor the pillory. That may be true, but it&rsquo;s the supporters of the pedestal who decided to dig Johnson up and make a big deal out of him. If anyone deserves to be criticized, it&rsquo;s them.</p>

That has always been a popular theme, from Rod Serling&rsquo;s &#8220;Requiem For a Heavyweight&#8221;, as well as television programs like &#8220;The Untouchables&#8221; and (the original) &#8220;Hawaii Five-O&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;there were race riots in more than 50 cities, in which 23 blacks and two whites were killed. Many riots started when angry whites attacked spontaneous public celebrations by blacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>If we can believe innocent black Americans were set upon by whites, we can&rsquo;t believe &#8216;the 23 blacks killed and 2 whites killed&rsquo;. At least I don&rsquo;t believe it. I suspect it&rsquo;s all part of the black victim mythology. If you believe it, why, during all the rioting during the 1960&rsquo;s and again during the Los Angeles riots, when &#8216;the situation was reversed&rsquo;, why do the numbers stay the same? 20 blacks killed and 2 whites killed, etc. I suspect this is the result of the lack of white special interest groups having a say, and the power of the mass media. Just one man&rsquo;s opinion. I knew someone who was at the Detroit riots during the 1960&rsquo;s. A guardsman called up during the riots. He said blacsk were shooting at people from the tops of buildings with high powered hunting rifles. He said he was more scared during the Detroit riots than he was in Vietnam. </p>
<p>Recall, after Hurrican Katrina, that of the 1,400 deaths attributed to the hurricane, the reports from the Katrina morgue showed that whites in the area were more likely to have been killed by the storm. A quick &#8216;Katrina morgue&rsquo; google can confirm that. So a higher percentage of the white population ended up dead after the storm. That is, they were &#8216;disproportionally affected&rsquo;. Didn&rsquo;t read or see that in the news. Far from it. </p>

		<p>This story is at the same time both very sad and quite revolting. He made it to the very top in a very questionable sport where failure or even success can mean having ones brains bashed to pulp. When he reached the top he was fabulously wealthy for those times, especially for an Afro-American. Unfortunately his new wealth, lifestyle and conduct brought him down.

American&rsquo;s have always preferred athletes with character above their abilities.<br>
Today, athletes of character in professional boxing are few and far between.<br>
But even after decades of Communism and diversity in sports whites are the only race in boxing to come out on top from a moral and athletic perspective worldwide.<br>
The proof is in fighters like the Klitchko brothers and          Natalia Ragozina who will play in the summer olympic games in London in 2012.</p>

Just because you do not agree with something does not mean it is false! I have to be candid here, it really annoys me whenever I see these arrogant, sorts cognitive dissonant sort of of posts.</p>
<p>So what if you do not believe that almost two dozen Blacks were killed by Whites? Newspaper accounts, court records and other DOCUMENTED AND FACTUAL evidence indicate otherwise. What motivation would southern and midwestern newspapers have to distort or trump up false charges in favor of Black people in 1911? Give me a break! </p>
<p>Moreover, as a number of fellow posters have mentioned, given the American climate of the early years of the 20th century that was rife with REAL racism against Blacks, this scenario would not have been difficult to beleive at all. To compare an radically different event like hurricane Katrina that took place a few years ago with a situation that took place in our nation almost 100 years ago is inept and insane to say the least.</p>
<p>It is exactly this sort of denial, &#8220;I do not want to hear what I do not want to hear&#8221; behavior that does significant damage to the credibility of the race realist movement. In fact, I would argue that you are not even a race realist. A race realist would not dismiss such solid, information that is verified both historically and has been documented by uttering such nonsense.  </p>

<p>blacks are in many ways a form of amusement to those of other races, they sing, they dance, they rape, they rob, they play sports, but when it comes right down to it their whole life seems to be built around sick and perverse pleasures in particular those of the flesh?

		<p>Jack Johnson&rsquo;s immoral behavior retarded the development of better race relations in the United States. In an era when a black man in the South could be beaten up for not calling a white man &#8220;Sir,&#8221; we needed a black boxing champion like Sugar Ray Leonard or George Foreman during his comeback.<br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, Jack Johnson did advance the sport of boxing. To someone who knows little of the sport, it must seem instinctive, like two bulls, stags, or rams running at each other with their horns.<br>
 <br>
Actually, every aspect of boxing, from the making of a fist, was invented by someone somewhere. The human hand evolved to grab, not to punch. Chimpanzees have hands that resemble ours. Male chimps are pugnacious. Nevertheless, they fight with their large canine teeth, not their fists.  <br>
 <br>
Jack Johnson&rsquo;s contribution to boxing was combination punching. A boxer out of range of his opponent&rsquo;s fists will plan to deliver one or more punches with both fists, he will go in close, deliver them, and get out of range before his opponent can hit back. Because his opponent has to block several punches at least one is likely to land.<br>
 <br>
Jack Johnson was a defensive fighter and a counter puncher. In the early rounds he concentrated on not getting hurt, while analyzing his opponent&rsquo;s style. As he gained more insight, he became more aggressive. Finally his opponent would make a mistake and get knocked out.<br>
 <br>
Many fight fans like sluggers. These have plenty of speed and power. They get in close and trade punches. I prefer boxers who use their minds, the way Jack Johnson did. </p>

		<p>The Mann Act was intended to prosecute those transporting women interstate for the purposes of prostitution or sexual captivity. Whatever you think of John Arthur &#8220;Jack&#8221; Johnson (1878-1946), unless he transported these women for the purpose of prostitution activities, he should not have been prosecuted.</p>
<p>Although the liberal and socialist view of Johnson is that he was persecuted and disliked because of his color, there were other reasons operating as well. The heavyweight champion was expected to represent a standard of manhood in his public demeanor. Johnson failed in this. He was a contrarian and iconoclast, and he paid a price for it. Repeat   &mdash;   his prosecution was probably undeserved, but he was not good idol material to say the least.</p>
<p>In his post boxing career as a vaudevillian and entertainer he was successful and largely embraced by the white public. Some people have tried to say that he was a victim of racism in this career as well. A more moderate view is that he was used to celebrity, constant travel, and making large amounts of money. Hard to see how he could have done that except in entertainment.</p>
<p>As a boxer, Johnson was a deserving champion. Absent the color line in boxing, he could have won the championship earlier in his career than he did. Although he later claimed that he took a dive in his 1915 fight against Jess Willard, this almost certainly was simply a malignant excuse. By then, Johnson was well past his peak.</p>

<p>&#8220;This story seems pointless to me. No one has ever claimed Johnson was a soft, sweet man. He earned a living by fighting, and never apologized for his vices.<br>
The author believes that Johnson is some sort of inhuman monster just because he was black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only partly because he was black.  It is mostly because as a black, he taunted whites (which might be considered racist or at least unsportsmanlike), preyed upon vulnerable white women and especially minors, used drugs, transported drugs, transported minors across state lines, violating the Mann Act, helping establish the business of black pimping of young white women in the 20th century, actually a slavery issue, and beat his wives, women.</p>
<p>We can never know how a well mannered, gracious black champion would have been received, but we know that this one was looking to outrage whites.  I remember how outrageous Cassius Clay was in the 1960s.  He got a pretty fair shake, and later became an icon, which he hardly deserved from a political/ethical point of view.  He got drafted and refused while Elvis got drafted and reported.  Perhaps that is the difference.  That he succeeded is the point for discussion perhaps.  </p>
<p>But your post betrays a bias since as a woman, you might at least object to him as a woman beater.  And you are incorrect about all boxers.  Many, in the past at least, have been decent family men.  Wasn&rsquo;t there a movie with Russel Crowe recently about one, &#8220;Cinderella Man?&#8221;</p>
