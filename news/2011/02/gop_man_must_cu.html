<h1>GOP: Man Must Cut Tie to White Group</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New England Cable News (Newton, Massachuetts),  January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chairman Doyle Webb said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that John Casteel should sever his ties with the Council of Conservative Citizens, which grew out of organizations that battled school integration in the 1950s and 1960s. {snip}</p>
<p>Casteel&rsquo;s e-mail was listed as the contact for both the Republican Party in Jackson County and for the Arkansas branch of the St. Louis-based group. After The Associated Press contacted the Council of Conservative Citizens to ask about Casteel on Monday, the group took Casteel&rsquo;s e-mail address off its website.</p>
<p>Clippings kept by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Ala.-based organization that tracks hate groups, include a council newsletter showing Casteel at a Conservative Citizens board meeting in 2007. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On its website, the organization rails against immigration from non-Western countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also oppose all efforts to mix the races of mankind, to promote non-white races over the European-American people through so-called &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; and similar measures, to destroy or denigrate the European-American heritage, including the heritage of the Southern people, and to force the integration of the races,&#8221; the site says.</p>
<p>Webb said it appeared the Council of Conservative Citizens has values contrary to the Republican Party and said Casteel must make a choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under Republican Party rules, I do not have the authority to remove a county chairman,&#8221; Webb said. &#8220;I personally would not be a member of such an organization, and would ask Chairman Casteel to immediately resign his membership from the Council of Conservative Citizens, because it appears its purposes are counter to the principles and beliefs of the Republican Party.</p>

		<p>So Mr. Webb, are you saying you support the denigration and genocide of European-Americans?  Do you support the existance of groups like the NAACP?  Black Congressional Caucus?  Hispanic Conressional Caucus?  The JDL?  Are only whites not allowed to organize in the own interests?  Are you even worse than Mr. Steele?  Geeze.</p>

<p>How does one celebrate black-on-White violence?<br>
How does one celebrate cultural degeneration through immigration?<br>
How does one celebrate affirmative action&rsquo;s forced discrimination?<br>
How does one celebrate the Africanization of Detroit, E St Louis, New Orleans and other economic and cultural depleted areas?<br>
How does one celebrate a the economic burdens caused by ethnic rebalancing?</p>

		<p>The Republican Party structure in Arkansas is horrible.  Pro-black and Pro-Hispanic as it can get.  Most elected Republicans out of AR are that way, save its new Senator, John Boozman, who has a Numbers USA highest rating.  But don&rsquo;t forget, this is the same party in the same state that gave us Mike Huckabee.</p>
<p>Leftist critics would find the headline of this article redundant.</p>

		<p>The national GOP is an absolute joke.  The leadership is scared of it&rsquo;s own shadow in regards to anything involving race.  Why do you think they elected Michael Steele to be the head of the GOP?  Local conservative Republicans can be great allies but the national candidates are pathetic retreads and apologists.  </p>

		<p>We all realize the many ways the US has become increasingly totalitarian in recent decades. For example, at the 1972 Democratic Convention Hubert Humphrey haggled with a still unrepentant George Wallace in a futile attempt to get the nomination. And Wallace and McGovern delegates coexisted peacefully on the convention floor. If this we were reenacted today the McGovernites would demand the deaccreditation and expulsion of the Wallace delegates. All this aside from having a Marxist-Globalist government dedicated to ethnically cleansing the historic American majority.</p>
<p>http://mangans.blogspot.com/2011/01/american-diversity-outreach.html#c4055480224993807778<br>
&#8220;America in its current multi-cult incarnation is the biggest threat to the survival of the European sovereign, free nation-states based on ethnicity. The European Union is just an avatar and an imitation of the American Big Brother, a partner and an ally which America can understand and deal with on familiar terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the USA has brought its troops in Europe by the end of WWII, Europe is an occupied territory whose ideology is multicultural globalism. If there&rsquo;s any chance in the world for nations with a white majority to survive, the first condition is the end of American hegemony. It&rsquo;s not only beneficial to Europe, it&rsquo;s equally beneficial to white Americans. As long as the Multicultural Empire in its current incarnation remains the first military power of the world, the social engineering designed to bring us into oblivion will continue. Even China would be more merciful with peoples of European stock than the diversity-fanatics who form the American elite - all of them, &#8220;right&#8221; and left, from Howard Zinn to Glenn Beck.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I have yet to hear of a single main stream Democratic politician object the the Congressional Black Caucus, which exists explicitly to promote the interests of black people.  The mass media did its best to hide Obama&rsquo;s connection to Jeremiah Wright during the 2008 campaign, and when he was outed by the internet the Democratic establishment did everything it could to make it a non-issue.  But if a Republican politician does so much as give a speech before an explicitly pro-white group, he is cast into the outer darkness.</p>

		<p>The gauntlet has been thrown down: anti-whites explicitly state their claim to the Republican party, the only viable opposition (within the current system) to the even more brazenly anti-white Democrat machine.  </p>
<p>Will pro-white people now jump ship because an anti-white told them to?   That would be a great loss, and a totally unnecessary surrender.   </p>
<p>Or will pro-whites stand and protect what is theirs, what has always been theirs, and tell this guy (and everybody else) that there is no place for ANTI-whites in the GOP? </p>
<p>How long now have whites been ceding ground, forfeiting homes, communities, jobs, governing authority,  and entire cities to anti-whites?    Even if the fight for serious political representation is already lost, we should fight like men, not flee like rats.  <br>
  <br>
Loud and clear resistance to the anti-whites is our duty to our fellow whites who do not yet realize what&rsquo;s happening.  </p>
<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s not lost.  White people will rally, once the true nature of the anti-whites is made clear to them.   The most fundamental self-interest there is, that of survival, demands it.  Same goes for the political establishment to which the anti-whites have NO legitimate claim.</p>

		<p>Considering what the Republican party has become, I understand why the Republican party would want to distance itself from the CofCC. What disgusts me is that the Republican leadership is relying on the SPLC, a liberal enemy, for guidance. If the rePubs need information on the CofCC, they need only access its web site. </p>

		<p>The media and the left, with the approval of the republicans, have denigrated people like David Duke and others to the extent that they are destroyed.  So any white man or woman who tries to support a pro-white agenda is quickly treated like Duke and lambasted as a nutcase.  The media and the left have perfected this line of attack to the point we have to have our women (Bachman, Palin,etc) do the fighting for us.  White men have effectively been emasculated, or in hillary talk, they have cut our balls off.  I have watched this coming for decades.  So now we are stuck with pansies like hucabee and lindsey graham.  </p>

		<p>It probably won&rsquo;t be in my lifetime that the GOP will finally learn they will never appease non-whites and will then start openly advocating for whites.  Many white conservatives today claim to be tough when dealing with people who wish us ill will, that is, until they are accused of being a racist.</p>

		<p>Why is this any surprise? The GOP has repeatedly demonstrated that it is the enemy of white Americans, and does everything it can to reduce us to second class citizens. Indeed, it&rsquo;s policies could eventually force us to take up arms against our own government and hostile non-whites. This just sealed the deal for more white Americans to never vote for the Republicans again. What is needed more and more is a political party that unapologetically stands up for our interests. Otherwise, vicious and brutal racially motivated civil war will settle the issue.</p>

		<p>No surprize here! Both parties cater to the lowest common demoninator&hellip;  The same game played by a corporate monopoly.<br>
Both parties cater to foreign ethnics (especially illegal).<br>
GOP pretends to be traditional for votes then turns on US to give favors to opposition.  If either party cared about white heritage both parties would encourage a white caucus or better they would denounce all racial special interests.</p>
