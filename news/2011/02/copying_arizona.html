<h1><a href="http://newsok.com/many-states-struggling-to-emulate-arizona-law/article/3537323">Copying Arizona Not Working for Many States</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Oklahoman (Oklahoma City), February 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SOME conservative members of the Oklahoma Legislature are eager to pass an immigration reform law that&rsquo;s every bit as stout as the one signed into law last year in Arizona. House Speaker Kris Steele and Senate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman aren&rsquo;t in such a hurry, wisely suggesting that law enforcement and others who deal with this issue every day be consulted before moving forward. </p>
<p>Lawmakers, Bingman said recently, need to &#8220;identify what the problem is.&#8221; They also might want to see how copying Arizona&rsquo;s law has worked out for other states. The short answer: not very well.</p>
<p>A major reason for this is money  &mdash;  most states are hurting, badly, as a result of the recession and thus have no way to pay for the changes that Arizona-style immigration reform would mandate, such as having police become much more involved in enforcing immigration laws. Oklahoma&rsquo;s treasury is certainly hurting, with a budget deficit of about $600 million forecast for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Florida, a bill that not long ago seemed headed for approval &#8220;appears to be on life support,&#8221; the Post reported. Immigration bills in Utah remain in the pipeline, but have been slowed after appeals by leaders from the business, law enforcement and education communities urged moderation.</p>
<p>We have seen that in Oklahoma, where business leaders and others have urged Republican leadership to focus on jobs and the economy. The same has occurred in Texas, where according to the Post more than three dozen immigration bills have been filed.</p>

		<p>YOU CAN&rsquo;T FOCUS ON JOBS AND THE ECONOMY without focusing on half the jobs being taken by illegal immigrants, and employers who care more about hiring slave labor than hiring Americans.  Moreover, every illegal immigrant costs additional revenue beyond another American who lost and can&rsquo;t get a job.  They have drained welfare, drained our school budgets, drained our police forces with the increase in crime.  Don&rsquo;t sell us some bull that the money isn&rsquo;t there.  Expel the illegals and what you save with them gone, will more than pay for the program of seeing them on their way.  And then some.  WE know that, and The politicians know that.  It&rsquo;s just making excuses so their corporate sponsors can continue to screw Americans and make bigger profits.  </p>

		<p>Of course, since the provisions in Arizona SB 1070 cost the state almost nothing, the cost issue is a red herring.  When they say &#8220;business leaders,&#8221; they mean cheap labor loving greedmesiters.  When they say &#8220;law enforcement,&#8221; they mean far left big city chiefs and elected sheriffs of Hispanic-heavy counties (i.e. Dupnik.)  When they say &#8220;education,&#8221; they mean school districts that directly benefit from swelled school enrollment because of the per capita per diem remittance.</p>

		<p>Unreal!  What a lame attempt to appeal to the fiscally conservative.  Any fiscal conservative worth his salt knows that the costs burden from illegals is much higher than whatever law enforcement costs are accumulated. </p>

		<p>States could do pretty much the same thing by severely limiting welfare and passing laws that give hefty prison sentences to those state employees caught putting an illegal alien on the welfare rolls.</p>
<p>There is no way to spin that.  It would save each state BILLIONS of dollars and cost nothing to implement.  It would basically reduce the mexican populations in that state to near zero.  It would also strong arm neighboring states&hellip;.no way they could afford to absorb the extra welfare cases.</p>

		<p> The cost isn&rsquo;t in applying the changes - its in the legal fees to fight the lawsuits from our very own government.<br/>
 There is no longer any respect for the federal government. They lie and cheat like the cartel bosses they are, and simply don&rsquo;t care if we get upset.<br/>
 Life is about growth and prosperity, govt. is supposed to be about letting that happen - not assuming it for themselves at our expense.</p>
