<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20110210/LT.Mexico.US/">Mexico Angry at US Official&rsquo;s &#8216;Insurgency&rsquo; Remark</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>E. Eduardo Castillo, Comcast News, February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Mexican government on Wednesday condemned comments by a top U.S. Defense Department official characterizing the drug gang violence here as a &#8220;form of insurgency&#8221;  &mdash;  remarks the official later apologized for and retracted.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinosa regretted that &#8220;outdated visions&#8221; on drug trafficking continue to be used and urged U.S. officials to refrain from commenting on issues they are not fully informed about.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Westphal made his initial remarks Monday at the Hinkley Institute of Politics Forum. In a statement Tuesday he said that in response to a question, he &#8220;mistakenly characterized the challenge posed by drug cartels to Mexico as &#8216;a form of insurgency.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My comments were not and have never been the policy of the Department of Defense or the U.S. Government toward Latin America,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I regret that my inaccurate statements may have caused concerns for our partners and friends in the region, especially Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Espinosa said the two countries &#8220;need to find cooperation mechanisms that lead to a greater ability to confront organized crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s totally unacceptable and inappropriate to see the problem unilaterally,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is not the first time Mexico has accused U.S. government officials of exaggerating the situation in Mexico. Last year, President Felipe Calderon protested after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Mexico resembled Colombia two decades ago, when drug traffickers controlled sections of that country.</p>
<p>Drug gang violence in Mexico has reached unprecedented levels since Calderon deployed tens of thousands of troops and federal police to trafficking hot spots four years ago, vowing to crush brutal cartels.</p>
<p>The fighting has at times taken warlike proportions, with cartel gunmen ambushing army patrols, staging elaborate roadblocks and carrying out horrific massacres.</p>
<p>Nearly 35,000 people have been killed.</p>

<p>I wonder why these same officials didn&rsquo;t get bent out of shape when a spokesman for US Military Intelligence said the most likely countries in the world to collapse into anarchy were Mexico and Pakistan.</p>
<p>And I wonder where the rage is over US  newspaper reporters who declare periodically that almost all the Mexican politicans, police and some military are corrupted by drug money? </p>
<p>And the Sinaloa Cartel DOES control a large portion of Mexico.  Old Hillary is finally right about something.</p>

		<p>Under no circumstances must we ever call the situation in Mexico what it really is. That simply would never do. The truth must be avoided at all costs! How could anyone not see that this much is obvious?</p>
<p>Just because the Mexican government has no control of the situation, it is outgunned, and regularly is defeated in battles with the narcoterrorists, why should we think that they are facing an insurgency? The narcos don&rsquo;t really want the country; they just want a passage way through which they can smuggle their goods, and a place to hang out and enjoy life between operations. If the Mexican government and the rest of the country would simply disappear, I think they would call it even.</p>

		<p>Who are these idiotas kidding???  Those of us who live in border states know all too well how incredibly dangerous it is to go to Mexico now.  It&rsquo;s too bad, because we used to have a lot of fun in that country, and their people made some nice money off us, while we got some nice goods - it was beneficial to everyone.  But now, the drug cartels have made even beautiful cities like Guadalajara unsafe.  I won&rsquo;t even ride the bus across the border any more.  I could get shot for looking at goods in a store on La Avenida.  The Mexicans need to stop lying about their situation - it&rsquo;s totally out of control, and anyone who goes anywhere NEAR Mexico now is a fool.  I hope it gets better soon, but as long as they aren&rsquo;t facing the truth, it won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I was scanning the radio yesterday and overheard a discussion on NPR about the stability of the government in Mexico.  When asked by the interviewer about how much the approximately 350 million American dollar support for the governments fight against the drug cartels, a Spanish accented consultant flatly declared that because the government is so corrupted and in many cases, actually part of the drug cartel structure, there was no hope for any effect at all.  No one remarked at the obvious conclusion that U.S. taxpayers are giving the drug cartels millions to them as a sort of bonus for being in charge.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t understand the incompetence and likely, our own corruption that has allowed this state of affairs to exist. <br>
