<h1>Fort Worth Elementary Teacher Accused of Assaulting Elderly Couple in Arlington Mall</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deanna Boyd, Star-Telegram, February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brenda Jones Stafford, a fifth-grade teacher at A.M. Pate Elementary School, is accused of choking and pushing a 71-year-old woman in an argument over a chair in The Parks mall&rsquo;s food court, then shoving, hitting and choking the woman&rsquo;s 73-year-old husband when he tried to intervene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Barbara Griffith, a Fort Worth school district spokeswoman, confirmed Wednesday that the incident occurred while the teacher was accompanying A.M. Pate students on a field trip. She said Stafford was placed on administrative leave Monday pending the outcome of the investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bette Davis Morgan and her husband, Carlton, were drinking coffee and chatting in the food court when Stafford, while apparently gathering chairs for her group, pushed a chair on which Bette Morgan was resting her leg, commenting &#8220;Listen, lady, I don&rsquo;t need your chair with your leg on it,&#8221; according to Morgan.</p>
<p>Morgan said she removed her leg from the chair and continued her conversation with her husband.</p>
<p>But she said Stafford deliberately shoved the chair against their table, striking Morgan&rsquo;s knee. Morgan said she told the woman not to shove the chair because it was hitting her knee under the table.</p>
<p>She said Stafford deliberately did it again twice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time she came by, she&rsquo;d shove that chair under the table toward my knee, hard,&#8221; said Morgan, who said she had injured the same knee in a wreck while in her teens.</p>
<p>After the third time, Morgan said, she got up and confronted Stafford.</p>
<p>&#8220;She made some kind of snotty remark to me, saying, &#8216;Don&rsquo;t you tell me what to do, woman,&rsquo;&#8221; Morgan said. &#8220;Then she got up in my face and started shaking her finger in my face and started blowing in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan blew back into the woman&rsquo;s face, she said, and the woman spat on her.</p>
<p>Morgan said that she spat to the side of Stafford and that the woman lunged at her, choked her and pushed her down.</p>
<p>Morgan said her husband was trying to intervene when Stafford shoved him down and began hitting and choking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s when her people started yelling at her to get off of him, that she was acting like a madwoman, and pulled her off my husband,&#8221; Morgan said.</p>
<p>Tiara Richard, an Arlington police spokeswoman, said that officers arrested Stafford in another area of the mall and that neither of the Morgans required medical treatment.</p>
<p>Morgan said Wednesday that bruises have surfaced on her body and that she plans to see a doctor Friday to be checked out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tarrant County court records show that in 1995 Stafford was previously charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and assault with bodily injury, stemming from allegations that she threatened injury to a woman while using or exhibiting a firearm. Prosecutors later dismissed both charges.</p>

		<p>Some people just don&rsquo;t seemed civilized now do they?   Seems some people just have a propensity towards ignorance, crudeness and violence. Some people are just naturally violent, crude and vulgar.  Could it be culture or genetics or environment? </p>
<p>One day when science actually discovers and proves there is a part of the brain that promotes or controls violence and that there is yet another part of the brain that allows for a person to have a conscience and act civil, do you think they would ever publish their findings?  I think not, it may tend to make some people look bad and we can&rsquo;t have that now can we?</p>

		<p>Love the &#8220;Ima Black Beeatch&#8221; glint in her eye for the mugshot. Please everyone remember, Blacks do not behave like us because (aside from the obvious evolutionary retardants) they simply have nothing to lose. Most do not own their home, have no valuables worth anything, lease their cars, etc. Do not become involved in an altercation with them because they will immediately resort to violence as is their genetic code and have absolutely nothing to lose when they are found to be guilty. They know this. So if she goes to jail for a few years (which is unlikely) she will come out to apply for a variety of &#8220;assistance&#8221; and be right back in the same economic and social position as before her two year stint. So please, everyone, even if it hurts the pride, just get away from them. We have everything to lose and they have nothing to lose. Our time will come. For now, smile and escape from them.</p>

		<p>What chance do our children have of not being ignorant, when people like this are teachers?  What percentage of the students knew they were looking at ignorance in action but are made to feel like a racist for feeling this way?  What percentage of students are already ignorant and had that behavior reinforced?  One can only wonder whether or not affirmative action is worth it.</p>

Prosecutors later dismissed both charges. </p>
<p>If the incident had occurred in Florida or Texas and the elderly lady had a concealed carry permit with her weapon on her, she would not have been charged if she were forced to shoot, as the stututes both allow for defense of oneself if they feel they are in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death.</p>
<p>As this society continues to disintegrate along with the financial plummet, more senior citizens should give serious consideration to concealed carry permits.  Black violence will only get worse.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised they were even allowed to bring that up. After all, what she may have done in the past has &#8220;absolutely nothing to do with her guilt or innocence in the current case.&#8221; Just ask the lefties.</p>

		<p>It is very telling that, at the original story page, the following message now appears where the comments used to be:</p>
<p>&#8220;EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE: Comments have been removed from this story because of repeated violations by users.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
The media is having a terrible time keeping the reality of black savagery under wraps.   Everyone I know, even the White liberals, are well aware of the truth of black violence and incompetence, although the White liberals won&rsquo;t allow themselves to admit it out loud - except for in private and trusted company.    </p>
<p>I feel that there is a widespread White awakening taking place, it is very exciting!  The media is obviously very terrified of this White awakening, even more than they are of black violent crime.</p>

		<p>What you see on the Internet, particularly on YouTube is the EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU SEE IN TV SHOWS. </p>
<p>TV shows most often show white people as evil racist rednecks that need to be taught a lesson by the liberal open minded whites and highly educated and articulate blacks.  Youtube videos 99% of the time show violent blacks attacking whites.  And that is consistent with my reality of living in Detroit.   </p>
<p>Whites are the victims in&hellip;.I believe 90% of inter-racial crimes.  Every person in my family has been assaulted by blacks. That is the gods honest truth. </p>
<p>I am glad people have seen fit to post all those security videos of blacks attacking whites on YouTube.  One video shows a black man punch a 90 year old woman on a walker, then he takes her purse.  Another video shows a white man in a wheelchair being assaulted by a young black.  THEN, much to my astonishment, another black who just happened to be walking by, joins in on the assault.    Mind blowing!  You NEVER hear Al Sharpton Comment on that! <br>

		<p>Comment #8 is pointing out something that I have been noticing more and more.  Any story where the black is the perp and a white is the victim either has no comment capability or a large percentage are removed or comments are turned off after only a few due to the opinions of the readers.  It does not take a genius to figure out that the comments do not match the liberal rag&rsquo;s agenda so they stop it all together.</p>
<p>With that being said, should she get fired?  Would a white woman that attacked an elderly black couple get fired, suspended, or even jailed?  What do you think?</p>

<p>Well, this <i>did</i> happen in Texas, which (like Florida) also allows the use of deadly force to protect a third party from such threat. So an armed bystander could also have legally shot the cretin to protect that couple. As I commented recently on another thread here, IMHO these &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; laws are a direct result of skyrocketing black thuggery, which legislatures are finally taking steps to suppress.</p>
<p>Like &#8220;Former Seattle Resident&#8221; (#8), I also noticed that editor&rsquo;s note. Translation: &#8220;Too many readers dared speak the truth about this incident.&#8221; As a former Arlington resident who often visited that mall, I&rsquo;m actually surprised the &#8220;Startlegram&#8221; ran the story at all. After all, that rag hired the late Marxist shrew Molly Ivins almost immediately after her former paper, the Dallas Times Herald, folded in 1991. It was also the mouthpiece for the totally corrupt local Congresscritter Jim Wright until he resigned from his post as Speaker of the House in disgrace.</p>

		<p>That mugshot tells me everything I need to know. I hope this elderly couple can sue her and the schoolboard, since she will probably just get a slap on the wrist in our criminal &#8220;justice&rsquo; system.</p>
<p>I also agree a lot with #3. Blacks readily resort to violence because they don&rsquo;t have as much at stake as whites or Asians do. I was often provoked by this loudmouth, obnoxious black jerk at my work. I knew I could have cleaned his clock, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to throw away, or at least, seriously derail, my life and plans because of him.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tall and fairly athletic so people normally leave me alone. But my parents, who are both short and in their late 70&rsquo;s, have told me how pushy blacks and particularly black women were with them. I thought they might have been exaggerating so the last time I visited them I stood back a ways so I could observe the behavior in the malls, walmart, etc. I was shocked to see how much blacks tried to crowd and jostle them. But they never seemed to do it when I was nearby. Clearly, they were seeking out elderly to push around. I recommend senior citizens get a concealed carry permit and practice to proficiency.</p>

		<p>I was raised to believe that only a tiny handful of blacks were like this hideous, savage, brutal woman, the majority were dignified in respectable, like Sidney Poitier, or the lovely, dignified blacks in To Kill a Mockingbird - who make most of the whites look primitive by comparison.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I understand how the psychological mechanism functions:</p>
<p>PRECISELY BECAUSE blacks are so startlingly, obviously different from us, we need to install a special &#8220;antiracism software program&#8221; into our brains to ward off perceptions of reality.</p>
<p>When we perceive blacks is radically, utterly, shockingly different, the &#8220;antiracism software program&#8221; kicks in and tells us that we are evil, racist, slave drivers, who are keeping blacks from reaching their potential as NASA engineers, neuroscientists, entrepreneurs, and physicists.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p>The more shockingly different they behave, the more our  &#8220;antiracism software program&#8221; tells us that the problem lies in our distorted racist perceptions, and hence the more we must redouble our efforts to fix our incorrect perceptions by editing them.</p>
<p>Most whites never get out of this crazy echo chamber, where the radically alien behavior of most blacks is reinterpreted as a defect in one&rsquo;s own personality.</p>
<p>Apparently, no behavior is bizarre or aberrant enough to break through the brainwashing.</p>
<p>Why do some whites wake up, and others stay in a coma?</p>
<p>We really need to study this question in order to find out how to deprogram people. </p>

<p>I basically agree with your post, I have to add&hellip;.   It&rsquo;s not that white folk are just now becoming aware of black pathologies, we&rsquo;ve always known it.</p>
<p>What is shifting is that white folk are no longer afraid to speak out.  Earlier we could just move away.  But as &#8216;diversity&rsquo; marches on and we get squeezed we realize we can no longer remain silent.  </p>
<p>The rise of White Racial Awareness is the unintended consequence of Multi-culti dogma.  </p>

		<p>I see several factors:</p>
<p>First is White-privilege myth that blacks have adopted as an excuse to hate Whites.<br>
Second is a genetic predisposition to violence.<br>
Third is a Black culture that encourages anti-White racial  hatred.<br>
Fourth is a White culture that has been cultivated by social engineering bent on displacing reason with absurd notions of White guilt. </p>
<p>Such racial hatred and violence is why Whites abandon shopping malls. When blacks overwhelm a shopping center, the crime and violence compels Whites to shop elsewhere.</p>
<p>The solution is to allow property owners, in this case the mall owners, to select who and who will not be permitted to access their property. White-only would not be an anti-black racist policy, but would be a defensive measure by whites to protect themselves, their property and their business interests against racist blacks.</p>
<p>Of course, black property owners should have the same right: to restrict access to their premises using whatever criteria they choose.</p>

		<p>Elementary school field trip to a mall?</p>
<p>The budget for this idiotic trip is probably about what a year of schooling cost when my mother was a child in the &#8216;30&rsquo;s in rural Tennessee.  She learned well &amp; had a brilliant career.</p>
<p>I say, slash all &#8220;education&#8221; budgets to the bone or more, now.  The money is utterly wasted on garbage, not actual fundamental learning.</p>

		<p>When I am among blacks I walk with the presence of a lion, physical capabilities to inflict grievous harm still intact. Those few who challenge me soon regret their indiscretion when seeing the wrath lying within my eyes.  Should a situation escalate I am prepared to go with it. There is a reason this old white man has a concealed carry weapons permit. I have a walking stick made of a titanium alloy fitted with an arthritic grip. Made for my older years, with this walking aide I feel confident of being able to wreak havoc on those who would do me harm. I understand that should a situation arise, I should not expect help from any quarter.  </p>
<p>When any black is around I go on hyper-alert. Not that you would notice as I present a calm friendly appearance. Trust is not high on my list of attributes for judging the behavior of blacks. Their propensity for violence coupled with our modern communication is going to be interesting to watch develop. We will face more and more fight or flight stimuli in the future.  When your flight mode kicks into gear it is important to not hesitate. Get yourself out of the dangerous environment as fast as possible.  It looks like I&rsquo;m going to be around to see the racial animosity towards us kick up another notch. I do not know how things are going to turn out but I will not go without a fight. I will not go quietly.  <br>

At present, society will almost never protect whites against the onslaught of non-whites, regardless of how ill-bred or even loony the latter are acting.  As other commenters have mentioned many times, the only thing whites can do is stay away from them.</p>

		<p>In such cases, it&rsquo;s a good idea to do a criminal background check on the perp. The mainstream media, pressured by groups like the NAACP will work to present the NW attacker in the best possible light, say that the White victims provoked the altercation and both sides were in the wrong and there needs to be dialogue etc.</p>
<p>But, with the use of modern investigative techniques, or hiring a PI investigator, an Amren reader/activist can find out the perps long criminal background of doing similar violent attacks., this information can then be presented to the victims, to the general community through the internet.</p>
<p>If activists had done this with the Duke Lacrosse stripper/prostitute - the whole anti White MSM propaganda machine would not have kicked in to high gear.</p>
<p>email me if you would like links to effective investigative contacts. A full criminal background check should cost ~ $100.</p>

		<p>From the mug shot you can tell this &#8220;teacher&#8221; is a real genius.  But, give her credit, she was instructing her students,&hellip;..on how to treat whitey, as if her troupe of ghetto &#8220;yutes&#8221; didn&rsquo;t already know that.  </p>
<p>Malls have become the new inner city black-holes. When blacks moved into the cities and brought with them their pushy and criminal ways, whites left and the great American cities died.  </p>
<p>The same is true with malls.  I&rsquo;ve watched several of my favorite ones fade away as whites abandoned them due to black thugs and ever present danger of violence. Tellingly, the first to leave are the book stores followed by jewelry merchants due to smash and grabs perpetrated by young people or teenagers, as it is usually reported.  </p>
<p>I found other places to go because I kept thinking that eventually I would be forced to use my conceal carry .38 on one of these fine superior and misunderstood people, thus forever being snared in a legal network that favors the criminal.</p>
<p>Neither do I visit diversity mongering, miscegenation loving, and China importing Walmart for much the same reason.  </p>
<p>I checked the Texas state teacher certification files and Brenda Jones Stafford does not appear. She could be under another name however or a variation of her name.  My suspicion is that she isn&rsquo;t a certified teacher. Likely she is an aide. </p>
<p>According to student demographics, the Pate (Pre-incarceration) Elementary School is 83% black and less than 1% white.  The rest are likely illegal Mexicans. </p>
<p>I like the way the reporter soft peddled the charges by saying that harm to a child and/or the elderly carries &#8220;state jail felony&#8221;.  The PC reporter wanted to make it sound kind of like it was as serious as running a stop sign. Actually it&rsquo;s a felony that can carry a severe PRISON sentence. </p>
<p>Also the article made sure to mention that Stafford self reported the incident to her school supervisors as if to say &#8220;see what an honest person this Stafford is!&#8221; </p>
<p>My guess is that charges will be reduced to misdemeanors with a couple of hours of community service. She might even claim that the victims provoked her by calling her the November word.  Her &#8220;students&#8221; of course will lie for her. <br>

<p>This might sound like a cowardly thing to do, but this is why I&rsquo;ve taken the advice of some AR regulars, and played a psychological game on blacks with whom I am in regular contact involuntarily   &mdash;   In our conversations, I talk down to their level and slightly below it, without coming off as condescending, so he/she/they interprets that they&rsquo;re teaching me something.  When I hear them say something that really isn&rsquo;t profound by they think is profound, I pull out my phone, call up the voice recorder or text editor, and &#8220;pretend&#8221; to make a note of it in front of them, as if their little &#8220;profundity&#8221; is actually going to help me, as if I think whatever it is they said is so brilliant.  Stroke their egos a little bit.  The best kind of blacks to play these games with are working or middle class blacks who aren&rsquo;t much criminal if at all   &mdash;   The kind that thinks they&rsquo;re smarter than they actually are.</p>
<p>The other trick is that when you are in a minor conflagration with a black, and it&rsquo;s the type of thing where cops or arrests could never be part of the picture, make everything your fault, and keep making it your fault.  That usually calms them down.</p>
<p><br>
Ethnic Crime:</p>
<p>In the 1980s (?), near Chicago, there was a freeway billboard advertising a black country club.  A middle aged black man who looked like he could have founded BET wearing respectable golf clothing, and holding a golf ball.  The billboard&rsquo;s tag line was, &#8220;Where only the golf ball is white.&#8221;  There was no such country club, but black activists and their white liberal shills paid for it just to make a point about &#8220;exclusive white country clubs.&#8221;  (Where most of the CEOs just love affirmative action, BTW.)  Most white people just blew off the billboard - As if to say, good, play golf with us nowhere near.</p>

		<p>Here in STL many teacher job postings explicitly say that preference will be given to candidates of color and there have even been &#8220;colored teacher&#8221; fairs. The idea is that black kids will do better in school and in life if they have teachers who look like them and are good role models. I know that this is just one incident, but maybe these colored teachers are a different kind of role model after all. </p>
<p>On another note, I often think it must be scarcely believable to our senior citizens that those who a few short decades ago could be jailed for looking at their wives in the wrong way are now bold enough to attack them in malls. </p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be around blacks very long before you realize what they really are made of. They are loud, noisy, ill mannered, pushy, ignorant fools in so many instances.</p>
<p>Having lived around these clowns in the past I offer this advice:</p>
<p>1. Avoid getting into situations where there are more of them around you than your own kind.</p>
<p>2. NEVER speak to one first, I don&rsquo;t know why but speaking to them first signal&rsquo;s white weakness to them.</p>
<p>3. Only the most direct comments do they understand, so if you want one to step back Be Very Direct and be prepared to back your words up with actions. They are NOT like us and they feel intimidation on their part will scare off most whites.</p>

<p>This is so true.  There was a mall I used to go to in my youth in Pontiac called the Pontiac Mall (I think they renamed is summit place).  Then the black population of pontiac exploded and fanned out from the rotten city core.  The last time I was there about 9 years ago it was a ghost town of a mall with huge sections lacking any store and even the lights were turned off in those halls.  I rounded a corner and peered into one of those sections.  It was dark and there were some black men loitering in the shadows.  We turned around and never went back.</p>

Love the &ldquo;Ima Black Beeatch&rdquo; glint in her eye for the mugshot. Please everyone remember, Blacks do not behave like us because (aside from the obvious evolutionary retardants) they simply have nothing to lose. Most do not own their home, have no valuables worth anything, lease their cars, etc. Do not become involved in an altercation with them because they will immediately resort to violence as is their genetic code and have absolutely nothing to lose when they are found to be guilty. They know this. So if she goes to jail for a few years (which is unlikely) she will come out to apply for a variety of &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; and be right back in the same economic and social position as before her two year stint. So please, everyone, even if it hurts the pride, just get away from them. We have everything to lose and they have nothing to lose. Our time will come. For now, smile and escape from them.<br>

<p>Well said Sir, You hit the nail squarely on the head. Excellent post. So many people haven&rsquo;t got that in their heads yet. Black people have absolutely no place in this society anymore. If they&rsquo;re in jail, living high on the hog, working at some low level job, it&rsquo;s all meaningless to them. At some level, they&rsquo;re aware of this as well. They&rsquo;re not totally stupid. I think they&rsquo;re aware that at some point, they&rsquo;re going to be dealt with and that they may as well enjoy all this when they can.</p>
<p>When I see a murder case reported in the paper and the murderer is a black person, invariably, there is no occupation listed of the murderer. Never. They&rsquo;re just floating around until something happens in their lives to push them in a certain direction. They have never been trained to a trade and can&rsquo;t even change a flat tire.</p>
<p>I wish everyone understood completely, as you do Sir, just what we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>

		<p>&#8220;One day when science actually discovers and proves there is a part of the brain that promotes or controls violence and that there is yet another part of the brain that allows for a person to have a conscience and act civil, do you think they would ever publish their findings?

		<p>Many black women are notoriously mouthy, quarrelsome, and aggressive. We all know the black female with the big, non-stop  mouth who bosses and intimidates everyone around her.</p>
<p>However, after many years of dealing with  black staffs, I have come to realize that there is special sub-set  among black females   &mdash;   perhaps one out of two hundred   &mdash;   who are hyper-hyper-aggressive. All they want to do is argue, bicker, and fight. They are indifferent to rules and procedures, they &#8220;know it all&#8221;, and are afraid of no one. They don&rsquo;t hesitate to go from verbal to physical.</p>
<p>Perhaps they have too much testosterone, or an extra male gene, or something such.  I really suspect that is the case   &mdash;   that it&rsquo;s chemical or hormonal. These extra-aggressive women are a category unto themselves, walking volcanos who are nothing but trouble. They will start a fight with anyone anywhere. You could say they are pitbulls in human form!  They are a nightmare to have to work with, or to supervise. This woman seems to be one of that type. </p>
<p>And like this woman, they tend to go into civil service   &mdash;   where they&rsquo;re protected by EEO and <i>cannot  </i>be fired. Let&rsquo;s see if she gets fired.  I predict she won&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;ll be backed by unions, EEO, NAACP, and all the rest of their organizations. She may even turn it around and collect a hefty award for being harrassed, humiliated, upset, distressed, or being called the &#8220;N&#8221; word.</p>
<p>The bottom line is to avoid such people in any way you possibly  can. Do not argue with them or have any conflicts with them. They will make your life a nightmare.<br>

		<p>I lived in Kansas City for several years and there was a Very Nice Mall (Bannister Mall) that did a wonderful business.</p>
<p>Then the blacks started to come (mostly young) and they started with their lewd comments to white females, aggressive actions toward young white females and intimidation toward whites who were alone (this is a key piece in the puzzle of IF you will be harassed or not, they like one lone white)</p>
<p>As time went by more and more blacks (shoplifters and thieves) started to come. The white patronage started to vanish and believe it or not THE MALL CLOSED AND WAS TORN DOWN.<br>
You can&rsquo;t make a living as a store owner when the bulk of the people leaving your store with merchandise DIDN&rsquo;T PAY FOR IT.</p>
<p>Now I live in Iowa and I see the start of the same thing here.<br>
And eventually the end result will be the same.</p>
<p>blacks (not all) but for the most part are invaders whose sole purpose in life seems to tear down what others have built.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to look far to see what they are capable of left to their own devices&hellip; Detroit, Oakland, Atlanta are just a few and I am sure AmRen readers could name many more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people just don&rsquo;t seemed civilized now do they? Seems some people just have a propensity towards ignorance, crudeness and violence. Some people are just naturally violent, crude and vulgar. Could it be culture or genetics or environment?</p>
<p>One day when science actually discovers and proves there is a part of the brain that promotes or controls violence and that there is yet another part of the brain that allows for a person to have a conscience and act civil, do you think they would ever publish their findings? I think not, it may tend to make some people look bad and we can&rsquo;t have that now can we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucus - Science has long understood what the functions of the brain are and where they are located.  Find a junior college level anatomy and physiology text, it&rsquo;s in there I guarantee you.  Comparisons of behavior and how it relates to the function is the question.  There is data, but it has long been very unPC to discuss it or perform the obvious statistical comparisons, even though it doesn&rsquo;t require much insight into science to notice the trends.  It has also long been unPC (even before PC) to consider genetics with regard to IQ or behavior.  However, the more we are learning from DNA research the more support for genetically caused IQ and other differences is growing.  This is why one rarely notices an article hailing the latest genetic discovery.  What researchers are finding tends to support the hated theories of eugenics and racial differences.</p>

<p>I agree with your post 100%. I had the gravest misfortune to work with just such a black woman. She was morbidly obese, believed she was very attractive(!) and was loud beyond belief - even when she wasn&rsquo;t particularly angry. Working with her was an absolute nightmare.</p>

<p>Playing games with strange blacks is not a good idea, if one must work with black coworkers then a reasonably tolerant attitude is required.</p>
<p>Outside of the office why play games? If they are a cashier or other person one must interact with be civil. Other than that do not engage them in any way. </p>
<p>I generally practice the superior &#8220;look through&#8221; them glance in &#8220;safe&#8221; public situations. Maintain eye level but look right past them slowly, if it is out in the open and one could be prey then look at them directly with coldness, let them know you see them and are sizing them up threat wise. Playing up to them in any way is a BAD idea, they read social signals and see weakness, like any predator.</p>
