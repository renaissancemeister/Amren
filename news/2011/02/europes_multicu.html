<h1>Europe&rsquo;s Multiculturalism Leading to Civil War?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dale Hurd, Christian Broadcasting Network, February 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a northern district of Paris, a brave shopkeeper named Marie-Neige Sardin guards her newsstand like a military fort. As a white woman, she is a minority in the mostly Arab-speaking Muslim area.</p>
<p>Sardin has been the victim of dozens of crimes  &mdash;  raped, robbed, and having acid thrown at her, as other residents try to get her to leave.</p>
<p>Still, Sardin  &mdash;  the daughter of a French soldier  &mdash;  calls her little shop &#8220;a piece of French soil inside occupied territory,&#8221; and says she will not leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t bear to tell my future grandchildren that I have done nothing to preserve our French values. So, staying here is marking our territory,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;No Go&rsquo; Zones for Natives</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>France has some 751 &#8220;No Go&#8221; zones. The French government has labeled these areas &#8220;sensitive urban zones&#8221; that are dangerous for whites and non-Muslims to enter.</p>
<p>French writer Guy Milliere said even the local authorities stay out of these zones.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that it&rsquo;s the part of the country where the police don&rsquo;t go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The firemen don&rsquo;t go and even doctors and ambulance don&rsquo;t go, except if they have no other choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&rsquo;s like that because these parts of the country are in the hands of drug traffickers, gangs and imams,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vardon said the government treats the majority in France like a minority. They have been marginalized politically and victimized by immigrant crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Anti-Islamization&rsquo; Only for Show?</b></p>
<p>The French government has made high profile moves against Islamization, such as outlawing the veil. But in Marseille, CBN News witnessed Muslim women wearing full burqas in front of French police officers who did not respond to them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marseille is France&rsquo;s second largest city and today, is about one quarter Muslim. But there are parts of Marseille that are completely Muslim. In reality, some of the &#8220;No Go&#8221; zones function like micro states that are governed by or under the influence of Islamic sharia law.</p>
<p><b>France&rsquo;s Dark Future</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today in Europe, there are many victims of multiculturalism like Sardin  &mdash;  people without political voices who are afraid to leave their homes. But she vows not to surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we want our daughters to wear veils in the future? Do we want them to live under sharia law? Do we want stoning to be practiced? No, it is not possible,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be the symbol of &#8216;No.&rsquo;&#8221; she added. &#8220;The symbol of &#8216;Stop.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

		<p>First off, it&rsquo;s not multi-CULTURAL-ism leading to internal strife, it&rsquo;s multi-RACIAL-ism.  </p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m surprised that even this sanitized version of this kind of story appeared in a news medium founded by that noxious race-mixing advocate, Pat Robertson.</p>

		<p>Just another example that World War 2 was nothing more than a white civil war that forever weekend Europe to the point of it&rsquo;s collapse and colonization by moslems and other non-whites.  The entire war was a crime against white humanity.  </p>

		<p>The French term for these areas is &#8220;Zones Urbain Sensibile&#8221;, or Sensitive Urban Zones. If you search for the term, you can find maps of all the regions, showing where the birders are, up one street and down the other, here turning left, there turning right. All of them are mapped. The maps are official government maps. In effect, they are the boundaries of the 750 Muslim colonies in France.</p>
<p>There is a French action movie called &#8220;Banlieu 13&#8221; like &#8220;Escape from New York&#8221; showing all the crime and violence in an imaginary Muslim/alien/illegal immigrant colony in France.</p>

<p>NOT LIKE - - IS!!</p>
<p>These no go areas sound to be even worse than most of the &#8220;ghetto&#8221; [so called] areas of the U.S. French police can enter only in a group, with guns drawn, and then in half the cases they KNOW they will meet resistance of some sort.</p>
<p>And gunless Europe is now awash with all sorts of firearms brought in from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And in many cases it has been this way for some time, decades even. A number of years ago these French police were involved in a car chase with French bank robbers who fled into the &#8220;Muslim quarter&#8221;. The French cops stopped and went no further. To do so would mean being mobbed and killed in thirty seconds flat. The cops had to gingerly approach the Muslim &#8220;elders&#8221; and ASK for their help.</p>

		<p>I do not understand why the French have allowed these Muslims to come in and take over their country.  I also believe we here in the U.S. had better take clear notice of the French situation, and prevent it from happening here.  Islam is definitely the enemy of ALL non-Muslim civilization, and we had better make up our minds to fight it with everything we have, starting NOW.</p>

		<p>Multi-Racialism really is the problem, and our TVs are saturated with it.  Let&rsquo;s hope the violence is part of the nightly broadcast.</p>
<p>Die Hard was on TV tonight, and the computer genius was a black, of course.  Thankfully, a rising % of Whites will see that nonsense and think, &#8220;Sure, like he&rsquo;s really a typical black, all smart with the computer codes and physics. Instead, I bet he&rsquo;s an affirmative action hire, diversity hire, &#8216;opportunity hire,&rsquo; and a whole team of underpaid Whites will be needed to come behind him and fix the mess, but only after they attend sensitivity training and agreed to constantly audit themselves for racial insensitivity and bias and to &#8216;find increasingly meaningful ways of holding themselves accountable to people of color for our unearned privileges&rsquo; &#8220;.</p>
<p>A beautiful White girl was killed in a car crash in Villa Rica.  The TV went out to the high school to interview all her grieving White friends. There they were, a row of Whites holding candles.  And of course, as if from out of the dark shadows, the &#8220;friend&#8221; who was interviewed for the longest was a nappy headed black.   The media has a mission to show as much race mixing as possible,in all situations and circumstances.  If they push it hard enough and long enough, our complaints against it will be so outdated that kids will consider it fun to mock us and date blacks.</p>
<p>Thanks TV, for perpetuating the Integration is Good for Democracy lie that forces diversity into the previously secure domains of Right Whiteness.</p>

		<p>The liberals can bang their heads until bloody, the fact is that cultures do not mix, assimilation is not in the lexicon of primitive people such as Muslims and the civil war shall come . Whether or not my European white brothers and sisters will stand and fight is another matter, they must fight alone because the likely hood that America will come to the rescue is zero. I wish them well. Mme Sardin is a brave woman indeed, my neighborhoods back in England are in the hands of Muslims, Sihks and the Hindu.</p>

		<p>You know we have a lot of &#8216;no-go&rsquo; zones here in the states - places where white people fear to tread and where they are no longer welcome, even though the places were all white 50, 60 or 70 years ago.</p>
<p>I have gone into some of those places, in detroit, in Washington D.C., in new york, where it is so rare for the locals to see a real white person that they stare at you like you&rsquo;re from another planet.  Then the young men start to eyeball you and threaten violence with their stances, then it&rsquo;s time to high tail it outta&rsquo; there.</p>
<p>It happened to me one early evening when I got off on the wrong subway stop in brooklyn.  Never in my life did I ever have the feeling that I would die, but that night I did, as I stepped out into a world that was not America. The local &#8216;african&rsquo; americans were looking at me like I was a fool who deserved to die, and the gangbangers were sizing me up in a very serious way.</p>
<p>There are parts of south florida I used to vacation in as a kid.  Last time I was there a couple of years ago, I knew it was no longer my country. It&rsquo;s so sad, but it&rsquo;s happening everywhere.  The wheels of history they do turn!</p>

Their organizations like CAIR, La Raza, La Mecha, (yes, NAACP, too), various Asian groups, etc., assure that there&rsquo;s a steady stream of tensions and conflict by their constant complaining about one insignificant matter or another, just as T. Roosevelt warned many years ago.</p>
<p>Too, it is cultural differences that set those of different cultures  &mdash;    &mdash;  but of the same race  &mdash;    &mdash;  against each other.</p>

		<p>I am very surpirsed to see CBN using such blunt language (for example, &#8220;As a white woman, she is a minority in the mostly Arab-speaking Muslim area.&#8221;), since I thought there were one of those evangelical networks that panders to minorities just like the mainstream news channels.  I thought at least they would add in a part about how, &#8220;we need to bring these Muslim brothers to Christ&#8221; or something, but instead they attack multiculturalism directly.  I certainly pray that Mdme. Sardin&rsquo;s bravery does not go to waste.</p>

		<p>Marie-Neige Sardin could be remembered as the Joan of Arc of 21st century France: a womam with steely resolve, and a single goal in mind  &mdash;  the removal of France&rsquo;s invaders. <br>
Sardin needs to get a good publicist who will work to keep her in the public eye. The French need to truly see, not just look at the woeful state of their nation.</p>

		<p>Wherever Islam takes root, civil war and massive massacres are inevitable sooner or later. It&rsquo;s not a matter of if a brutal civil war will drown the streets of Europe in pools of blood, but when. The same fate awaits the United States, Canada, Australia and any other formerly white or mostly white nation that has been infiltrated by followers of Islam. And it&rsquo;s all the fault of Europe&rsquo;s ruling elites who apparently are full of malice towards the native white population, just as the ruling elite of the United States, Canada and Australia are towards the native white population in those nations too. Nobody asked the populations of any white, western nations if they wanted to welcome a bunch of people who regards all non-Muslims as &#8220;kaffir kuffars&#8221; and believe they have a God given right to rape, murder and mercilessly oppress non-Muslims. If they did, the answer would have been a resounding and forceful &#8220;NO!&#8221;</p>

It&rsquo;s obvious why things like this happen society has simply too complex.  Governments in the World have assummed more and more responsibilities to the point where their power is extended to the breaking point which is what we have seen in the Mideast.  Society as a system has become so complex that it requires more and more energy to keep it running.  So much so that it&rsquo;s really at the point of breakdown:</p>

<p>Honestly if Janet Brewer decided to tell the Feds that to go take a walk what are they going to do?  Take her court?  Most of the US miltary is deployed across thousands installations overseas.  If Arizona decided to follow it&rsquo;s own policies in reality there is not alot of the Federal government could do. </p>
<p>The 21st century represents the breakdown of central government.  Fortunately for Obama people like Ms Brewer don&rsquo;t realize this&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..yet.  </p>

		<p>many Europeans are waking up, but most are still sleepwalking over the cliffedge. </p>
<p>I was just thrown off an English-language online magazine in Germany for pointing out that crime in Europe is disproportionately Muslim, for pointing out the obvious, that Muslim mass immigration has plunged Europe in two bankruptcy, chaos, this function, and the crime epidemic.</p>
<p>as in the United States, it&rsquo;s a question of &#8220;kill the messenger&#8221; rather than admit that the Muslim invasion has been an absolute cataclysm for Europe.</p>

<p>No,ice, QD is right. It is multi-RACIALISM ( meaning different RACES) that is the real danger here.  White Europeans made up of different WHITE nationalities (cultures) melded together to form America. We have Swedish culture, English culture, Norwegian culture, Dutch culture, etc. that were able to melt together simply because of their WHITE race AND cultures. Different RACES in one country can&rsquo;t and will never melt together and the proof is in the pudding throughout all of history. Look around at the America of now and the Europe of now, compared to when they both were comprised mostly of their own race.  See any huge differences? </p>

		<p>     I had an older relqative who was a soldier in WW2 and took part in the US Army Normandy invasion.  He married in Europe and remained in France after the war ended.  He told me that the city of Marseille (sp?) was like this before WW2.  The French police would never enter the Arab Quarter of the city because those who had done so were never seen alive again.  During the war, French Resistance fighters who were were wanted by the Gestapo fled there.  When the Gestapo agents followed them into the Arab Quarter they were killed.  After this happened a few times the German army surrounded this area and soldiers entered in force and ordered inhabitants to leave a house.  Those who came out were taken prisoner and sent to concentration camps.  The soldiers then dynamited the house and proceeded to the next one.  He said that the local French people were grateful for this and the city became a much nicer and more civilized place after the war.  Unfortunately the French did not learn a lesson and now the whole country is becoming an Arab Quarter.</p>

All these areas are non-White.(what does that tell you) As a White American,there should not be anywhere in this country I should fear! The reason minorities get away with this beheviour is that they stick together. Until Whites learn this and start sticking together, nothing will change! How about we vote in another anti-American minority to repress White&rsquo;s. It looks as though a civil war is inevitable.</p>

Twenty-five (25) Mexican lives for each White life sounds like a fair and reasonable exchange ratio, if that Civil War takes place.

<p>&#8220;Just another example that World War 2 was nothing more than a white civil war that forever weekend Europe to the point of it&rsquo;s collapse and colonization by moslems and other non-whites. The entire war was a crime against white humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree to an extent, but remember the Asian theater has also been called a kind of race war, with racial stereotypes used in propaganda by both sides, and the Japanese declaration that the Japanese people were superior to all others and destined to rule over them.  It was a WORLD WAR because it involved more regions than Europe.  But I do agree that the European situation was tantamount to a civil war.  In fact, its origins may be traced to the split and long history of Christian wars pitting Catholic against Protestant, the remnant of which still remains in Northern Ireland.  &#8220;I do not bring peace, but a sword.&#8221;  &#8220;For my sake, son shall rise up against father, and brother shall fight against brother.&#8221;  &#8220;Those who live by the sword, will die by the sword.&#8221; Oh, Amen to all that.</p>

<p>NO, it&rsquo;s both.  Since it is largely motivated by religion, and the very overpowering history of religious conquest by both sides figures DOMINANTLY in the history, it is cultural, because religion is a major defining point of any culture.  However, race is involved as well because the difference between Arabs and Europeans is great enough for both to historically notice and note.</p>

		<p>Liberal New Hampshirite shocked when African refugees assault her 12-year old girl and aren&rsquo;t punished: <br>
https://mydaughtersassault.blogspot.com/2011/02/my-12-year-old-daughter-attacked-by-14.html<br>
(&hellip;)</p>
<p>&#8220;The arguments between my daughter and these boys started with  a couple of the boys asking Morgan to be their girlfriend.  When Morgan turned them down, they retaliated by calling her names like &#8220;fat ho, lesbian b**ch, c**t, etc&hellip;&#8221; this goes on for about a month before the first assault on the bus occurs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the principal received notification about the bus incident, he took another week to address it.  Not once was I ever notified that my daughter was assaulted on the bus.  The principal questioned my daughter and the boys that had been threatening her.  The boys were never suspended or removed from school.  Shortly after the conversation the students had with the principal, Morgan was brutally attacked.  First elbowed in the face, followed by 6 to 7 punches knocking her front teeth out and leaving her with a concussion.  It took four teachers to get one of the boys off her.&#8221;<br>
(&hellip;)<br>
&#8220;The dentist said this was the worst trauma she&rsquo;s seen to a child&rsquo;s mouth.  If the teeth end up taking, which there is a 80% chance they won&rsquo;t, she will have to have at least four root canals among other reconstructive procedures.  In the meantime she has to eat from a straw for the next month and possibly two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I asked the principal why he didn&rsquo;t tell me of the incident on the bus two weeks prior his response was &#8220;I have things to do and other people to talk to&#8221; followed by a condescending chuckle! This was his response to parent in tears at ER with her daughter.&#8221;<br>
(&hellip;)<br>
&#8220;My sister, along with my mother were the first to arrive at the school and were greeted by the Vice Principal saying &#8220;there are two sides to every story&#8221; in response to asking what action is being taken against the boys.&#8221;<br>

		<p>It would be interesting to hear from some racially aware Europeans - French in particular since they seem to be in the worst predicament - about how they propose to solve this problem. </p>
<p>What do you do? Strip people of their citizenship? Who? Recent immigrants? How many generations do you go back? Where do you send them? Will these European countries be compelled to give away parts of their territory to these populations? Let&rsquo;s face it, any real solution will require what is known as ethnic cleansing - wide scale forced movements of people. It would be ugly. And what would be the goal? To remove foreign populations entirely? Would you allow any to exist? 10%? 20? </p>
<p>I think some sort of showdown is inevitable. Either that or Europe as we knew it will cease to exist.</p>
<p>Let this be lesson to any who dare listen. It&rsquo;s a helluva lot easier to let them in than to force them out!</p>

		<p>If you want to know what Europe&rsquo;s future will be in regards to Islam then all you have to do is look to its past. Since the crusades in the 1100s Christian Europe has been at war with Islam. Fast forward to modern times and the nations of Europe have swallowed a very nasty scorpion by importing massive amounts of radical Muslims into their countries. In my crystal ball I see massive religouse ward engulfing the major cities of western Europe by the mid point of this century. Cities such as Paris, France; London, England; Amsterdam, Holland; Berlin, Germany and Brussels, Belgium will look like Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. </p>
<p>The more I read about Europe&rsquo;s Muslim debacle the more I have to ask what has happened to our European brothers? There was a time when each nation in Europe such as England and Germany were power houses of the world. They ruled over countless colonies around the globe and subjegated millions to their whim. Now after two world wars and fifty years of liberalism and political correctness have essentially castrated the former European powers. Unless they regain a backbone then they may very well be conquered by Islam, not by guns, bombs, or swords, but by the birth canal. </p>
<p>From what I have read and heared, most European nations have fallen below replacement level fertility while their Muslim cohorts have a much larger birth rate. Nature proves that when one species ceases to repopulate itself while a more reproductive species propogates itself then the weaker species will inevitably die off and the stronger one will take over. Will the countless millenia worth of European history be brought down via birth rates?</p>
<p>If these birth rate disparities are true then Europe may have less than a few decades to take back their homelands. This is why I forsee the rise of a twenty-first version of Hitler who will gain enough power to expell the non-European from the continent. However, this time the strong man will not have to brain wash the masses because the threat of multi-culturalism will be so grave to the people of Europe that they will willingly follow his commands. Of course I am not a supporter of Hitlerism, but I do see another strong man rising to power to save Europe, if we are lucky. </p>

<p>Exactly.  That&rsquo;s because they have been propagandized into believing that this is the accepted  &mdash;  and morally superior  &mdash;  majority viewpoint.  Sixty years ago, exactly the opposite views were held by the majority.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;These are whites who have had little contact with racial groups that cause problems.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I only wish that it were so. Unfortunately, even many Whites who rub shoulders (and other body parts) with blacks and mestizos on a daily basis still subscribe to the &#8220;Diversity Is Our Strength&#8221; mantra.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when they start to feel the strain of cognitive dissonance that they are susceptible to being awakened to the truth.  The lucky ones end up at sites such as these.</p>

		<p>The French allowed this to happen because they bought into the idea that diversity is ok, that immigration from alien hordes to their nation wouldn&rsquo;t change the demographics of their country. But now, the problem for them has gotten so out of hand, that they have lost portions of their country to these invaders, the muslims, who don&rsquo;t assimilate into a culture after immigrating.  This sounds exactly like what is happening in the US today. There are already parts of this country that have been taken over by foreign invaders. If it can happen in France, and already, S.

Since it is largely motivated by religion, and the very overpowering history of religious conquest by both sides figures DOMINANTLY in the history, it is cultural, because religion is a major defining point of any culture. However, race is involved as well because the difference between Arabs and Europeans is great enough for both to historically notice and note.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right WP about both multiculturalism/multiracialism causing internal conflict, and Question Diversity is so obviously wrong I can&rsquo;t imagine any WN making such an inane claim.</p>
<p>But neither of you can seem to grasp that there are cultural difference besides those based on religion that keep this country constantly on the brink in one form of chaos or another.</p>
