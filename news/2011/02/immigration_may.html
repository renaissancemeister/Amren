			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeffrey Tucker, Christian Science Monitor, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I know this observation is ridiculously aggregated, but when you take a coast-to-coast flight it is impossible not notice that the vast amount of land space is the U.S. is completely empty. You would swear that the country was an uninhabited wasteland. Then you reflect on the immigration debate and get the strong impression that we are fighting for room to breath around here. It&rsquo;s just a strange dichotomy. It&rsquo;s one thing for Japan to worry about immigration, or Switzerland, or even Austria. But the U.S.? There are other factors, I know, but it&rsquo;s probably true that 10 times the world population could live comfortably in the U.S.. The immigration debate is really about other things: fights over voting blocs, for example. Without labor unions, public infrastructure, and political parties, I don&rsquo;t know why anyone would even care about immigration.</p>
<p>David Veksler, the technical mastermind behind Mises.org, recently went to work in Shanghai, China{snip}. Let me share with you his facebook update from this morning:<blockquote>After living in China, I am convinced that the only real advantage America has over other countries is its historical openness toward immigrants. Once that ends (and I am thinking of the potential end of birthright citizenship) the United States will quickly sink into the muck of welfare-statism and never be heard from again.<br>
</blockquote>{snip} I look around at the native bourgeoisie in this country and see incredible dependency, sloth, debt, and the absence of the enterprising spirit of 19th century legend. But you look at the immigrant classes and you see the opposite. Again, wild generalizations of course. But David&rsquo;s comment taps into enough intuition I have developed from casual observation to make me wonder.</p>

		<p>Maybe the &#8220;spirit of enterprise&#8221; is present in SOME immigrant groups here in the USA, but I can guarantee you it doesn&rsquo;t exist in first-generation Mexicans or in Somalis or in any other group from Africa.  I&rsquo;ve seen this first-hand.  These are immigrants we could well do without.  I say we should go back to the practice of allowing only educated and/or skilled laborers to immigrate into this country.  That way we&rsquo;d be getting people with something worthwhile to give, instead of the rank takers we&rsquo;ve been getting.</p>

		<p>A bit of background is in order: </p>
<p>-author Jeffrey Tucker is editorial vice president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, a think tank that espouses the Austrian School of economics.</p>
<p>He builds his column around a quote from David Veksler, &#8220;the technical mastermind behind Mises.org&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The Ludwig von Mises Institute (LvMI) is based in Auburn, Alabama. Its scholarship is inspired by the work of Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises.</p>
<p>It is self-described as a &#8220;libertarian academic organization engaged in research and scholarship in the fields of economics, philosophy and political economy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that he advocates laissez-faire economics and neo-conservative open border immigration policies (bigger is always better). </p>

		<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem to see the land it takes to support each person.  It is perfectly true - we can put the whole human population on Manhattan.  Sustaining that population takes much more land, water, and resources.  </p>
<p>In general, white countries are less overpopulated than non-white countries.  Take Egypt.  80 million people in the middle of the sahara desert with one large river.  Less than 1% arable land.  </p>

		<p>3:  Tucker is fair game, but I don&rsquo;t think the entire LVMI is.  </p>
<p>By libertarian standards, the LVMI and most of the people associated with it are relatively race conscious and immigration conscious.  By no means are Lew Rockwell and the late Murray Rothbard erstwhile versions of Jared Taylor, I admit.</p>
<p>AMAF, I first heard about Sam Francis in an article of a newsletter that Rothbard and Rockwell co-wrote until the former&rsquo;s death, RRR (Rothbard-Rockwell Report).</p>

		<p>I think the question most important at the heart of the &#8220;immigration&#8221; issue is the legality of the immigrant. If you go through the LEGAL process and do things the RIGHT way and the LEGAL way, then welcome.</p>
<p>That is not the topic of discussion with regard to the ILLEGAL immigration that we have today. It is not so much immigration per se but ILLEGAL immigration and the scofflaws with their arrogance.</p>
<p>Wait your turn and do it the right way and welcome. Otherwise, stay out.</p>

<p>Without ever having heard of Jeffrey Tucker, a quote (usually attributed to Kenneth Boulding) immediately came to my mind:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as far as this one goes:</p>
<p><i>Once that [immigration] ends (and I am thinking of the potential end of birthright citizenship) the United States will quickly sink into the muck of welfare-statism and never be heard from again.</i></p>
<p>One has to &#8220;marvel&#8221; at how well all the third world immigration into California has halted the slide to &#8220;welfare-statism&#8221;. You know, unlike other states that have far fewer non-European immigrants.</p>
<p>Like Sam Dickson said about liberals, these &#8220;technical masterminds&#8221; are obviously mentally ill. I hope that one day they will be able to get the help they need.</p>

<p>This comment tells me that the author is entirely clueless about why most people have a problem with illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Also, 2  &mdash;  El Cerotito makes an excellent point - the notion that illegal immigrants are all enterprising hard workers who loathe taking advantage of the welfare state is just silly.</p>
<p>LA County - ground zero for illegal immigration in this country - is literally at the breaking point, straining to deal with the burden illegal immigrants place on the welfare state there.</p>

<p>This Tucker fellow simply doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s typical of libertarians who see all things through a dogmatic prism and pass uninformed judgments without making the effort to being well-versed in the facts about a particular issue.</p>

		<p>LvMI is correct about so many thing, but it falls flat on its face regarding immigration.</p>
<p>How much of the sloth of native born Americans is due to immigration?  Kids can&rsquo;t find jobs because the entry-level workforce jobs that used to be done by teenagers are now done for less pay by middle aged hispanic women.</p>
<p>They want to go to college and get an engineering degree?  Spend 5 years going into debt, take math and physics courses from foreigners who can&rsquo;t speak english, then graduate and work for peanuts or get replaced by an H1-B immigrant.</p>
<p>Want to start a company?  Try competing with woman or minority owned businesses for contracts!</p>
<p>The healthy thing for us to do is &#8220;mow your own damned lawn!&#8221;  But then I guess we take an opportunity away from an enterprising immigrant.  Can&rsquo;t have that!</p>
<p>Anyone who values a larger GDP than protecting their civilization is sick.  </p>

		<p>Even before I read the article, I noted a fundamental error, the title:<i>Immigration May Be the US&rsquo;s Main Strength</i></p>
<p>The U.S. is not a simple entity, but a very complex one, made up of over 300M human beings, divided and cross divided into many many groups. The question is not simply &#8220;Is immigration a benefit?&#8221; but &#8220;For whom is immigration a benefit?&#8221;</p>
<p>For Libertarians, borders are at best unnecessary and usually detrimental. They look ahead no further than the GDP. They love massive immigration to the U.S. America&rsquo;s billionaires take the same view, except they are motivated by their own financial interests. </p>
<p>For many unemployed white men immigration is a plague, that has destroyed their once comfortable existence. They hate massive immigration. </p>
<p>For Democratic politicians more immigrants mean more votes for democrats. So they love massive immigration.</p>
<p>For serious nature conservationists (such as those  purged by the Sierra Club) immigration means environmental destruction. Both by the increased population, and the  indifference of these immigrants to preserving America&rsquo;s natural heritage. </p>
<p>Immigration: It strengthens some; it incapacitates others.<br>

		<p>The real gains of 19th century immigration were not only more people but the United States was growing in actual size. In the years between 1800 to 1900 the land mass of the US more than doubled. </p>
<p>The real problem with our modern form of immigration is that there are no jobs for the people that are comming here. They are actaully used to displace American workers. We are not creating jobs the way we were during our industrial period.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what jobs American workers want to do and what they don&rsquo;t want.  Sooner or later un-employment benefits and even state welfare programs will run out of money and then the stuff will hit the fan because we will have millions of citizens without work and no way to live and they won&rsquo;t be happy campers. </p>

<p>I agree. If you remove everyone from the population who <br>
1. Receives welfare checks<br>
2. Receives disability checks<br>
3. Receives social security checks<br>
4. Is in elementary school or high school<br>
5. Is in college or graduate school<br>

		<p>this reminds me of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s observation - first the commies run things into the ground via insane regulation, then they blame &#8220;capitalism&#8221; for not working. Well, in the here and now it works equally well for both the commies (not just Obama, the government structure in pretty much its entirety) and for a good chunk of the corporate elite that wrecked things through outsourcing, looting wealth for its own ends and sometimes just being too dumb to do the right thing. And it&rsquo;s not just &#8220;capitalism&#8221; being blamed but also a group of people (Americans) that believed and practiced it for decades and centuries.</p>
<p>If the ongoing economic wreck is destroying people&rsquo;s initiative and sense of self-efficacy, the solution is not to elect the new people who are better at navigating the corrupt, mismanaged and full of lies environment that America is becoming. The solution is to build a new economy. An economy, inter alia, unencumbered by the looters, wreckers et al that destroyed the previous one.</p>

		<p>It seems impossible that the author doesn&rsquo;t know about the welfarism of so many immigrants, so he probably does and is intentionally and disingenuously ignoring plain facts  &mdash;  a very common practice on the part of the left.  However, those who depend on knowledge acquired from the MSM can easily remain ignorant of facts regarding immigrants.  I have an alert, intelligent, elderly relative who spends a lot of time watching news and politics on TV.  Last year, it took me months to even begin to convince him that states were going broke paying for services to illegals.  He&rsquo;d heard nothing of the schools, hospitals, and prisons that were financially at the breaking point because of immigration.</p>

He&rsquo;s right about some things but not in the way he meant it to be.  Only 66 percent of working age people are White coupled with the fact we have a huge underclass of black and brown people living off entitlement programs and we keep importing more and more.  </p>

		<p>What makes America great is not immigration, but a fairly uncorrupt court system, laws that are equal for all citizens and the knowledge that private property can not be taken so it encourages industry.<br>
 Immigration in small amounts, similar to the kind before the 1965 law was passed does little harm. massive unending immigration that drives the country to a half a billion only to profit those that benefit from inmmigration while passing the social,economic and environmemtal costs onto the communities is a sad bargain.<br>
Social cohesion is never acknowledged by the libertarians, they think you only need to get rid of welfare and social programs and all will be fairy dust and unicorns. if we soon become a tribal nation we will be divided and ungovernable, allowing the corporate whores and global banksters to continue to run us into the ground and accept a foreign governent</p>

		<p>Mises.org is a web site I frequently access, and generally appreciate the points of view expressed there, even if I often disagree. Some of their contributors openly advocate anarchy as a logical goal of maximizing freedom.</p>
<p>One problem I have with their economic analyses is their glossing over of the harm caused to native workers who are displaced by invasions of foreign workers (legal or illegal) or the outsourcing of manufacturing to other countries. Sure, such policies may result in lower prices that marginally benefit our populace as a whole with lower prices, but a distinct subset are thrown out of work, with possibly non-transferable skills, resulting in their impoverishment. Are those of us in this degrading position just supposed to take one for the team?</p>

		<p>The misinformation in this article is astounding. Immigrants are much more likely to use welfare than U.S. natives. The leading authority in the field, Harvard economist George Borjas, calculates that immigrants are fifty percent more likely to receive welfare than natives. </p>
<p>On average immigrants are less skilled and educated than natives. To a very large extent we are importing poverty. Perhaps many immigrants have a good work ethic to begin with, but our welfare system corrupts either them or their children as time goes on.</p>
<p>As for our wide open spaces, the reason we don&rsquo;t develop them is the same reason the Chinese don&rsquo;t develop the Gobi desert  &mdash;  not enough water. In our western states, the aquifers are falling and the Colorado River is drying up. But we can&rsquo;t expect immigrationists and other utopian fools to notice such practical matters.   </p>

<p>&ldquo;White people have lost their work ethic; that&rsquo;s why so many immigrants are pouring into the US!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seems to be a case where an immigrant, cleverly looking for a new argument for his and his people&rsquo;s invasion of America, has found an ally in an old school Redneck attitude that says, &#8220;Cut ur har and git a job.&#8221;  Both are based on questionable, and dated stereotypes.</p>
<p>In any society, when a period of growth and wealth with the expected rise in luxury, both in time and money, such as we saw in the Post War period (after WW2) or even the 1920s, the labor market becomes scarce.  In the Post War period, more Americans went to college than any time in history anywhere in the world.  By the 1960s, labor shortages were real.  I think that this is just one of many (and perhaps larger reasons) for the passing of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act.  However, as the Baby Boom generation came to the market, they found competition high and the economy suffering regular recessions, helped along, we might recall, by two oil shortages due to the manipulations of OPEC.  Sex, drugs, and rock and roll aside, the dye was already cast.  I know of many white people, including myself, who could not get a job working picking crops because of race.  I had done it as a youth in 1965-66, but by the &rsquo;70s, you couldn&rsquo;t get work if you were not Hispanic.  An AA was already in place.  In Sacramento, we had the famous Bakke Decision protest going on.  This was were a white student was refused entry into the UC Davis Medical program because he was white, even though he had scored higher than any minority applying.  He was excluded merely due to his race.  AA prevented me from attaining a job at the State Capitol, even though I had a letter of introduction from a State Senator.  I lobbied for the job for three months. As the new year session began, it was announced by a Senator named Moretti, that all special services would be hired from minority groups.</p>
<p>I will not go on and on in this.  The point is that whites have been systematically, politically, and even through on the job bullying, been excluded from the labor market.  Once a small group of Hispanics got on board in any job, whether it was construction or flipping burgers, they made whites uncomfortable through comments, theft,  and even violence.  It was not unusual for a lone white to be confronted by a number of Hispanics (they always were humble as singles, but vicious in packs), and attacked.  In the &rsquo;70s, whites were already intimidated and isolated, so they would just go away and look for a more peaceful place to work.  My last job as a health care professional was at a clinic that served mostly Hispanics.  The Hispanic staff was very difficult to work with and I was even sexually harassed (can&rsquo;t go into this, but it was discussions of male anatomy of differing races in my presence).  My discover of rampant insurance fraud caused my exit, and final conclusions regarding the nature of Hispanics. </p>
<p>The overall effect by the late &rsquo;90s was a growing number of totally defeated and beat down whites.  Today, these people tend to be blackified in every way, and often referred to as white trash, even by whites.  But their number is growing and the generalizing of whites into a defeated, low class population seems certain now.  The current strategy seems aimed at breeding them out of existence as they turn to minorities who have jobs as marriage partners.  And I have seen that in action everywhere I go.</p>
<p>I read and saved an article from CNN Money yesterday entitled, &#8220;How the Middle Class Became the Underclass,&#8221; by Annelyn Censky.  Stats reveal that middle class wages have remained the same between 1988 and 2008, while the wealthiest 1%, those making over $380,000.00 a year have only grown richer, helped along by Republican (Reagan) legislation.  The gap between the wealthiest few and the masses of underclass has grown and there is no indication that the trend is limited.  Trickle down economics never worked.  </p>
<p>Of course, it is more complicated than that.  Union busting and the globalization of labor has done it too, as well as the labor immigration into the U.S.  The result is a growing number of whites who are dependent on public assistance of all sorts.  The really interesting part was the last sentence of the article wherein the writer noted the Wall Street compensation consultant Alan Johnson said, &#8220;I think it&rsquo;s a terrible situation, because what we&rsquo;re obviously heading toward is some kind of class warfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Summing this up by saying that whites lost their work ethic is not just false, but it is a racial slur and a huge insult against whites in general.  It amazes me how this Machiavellian strategy works,and right under our noses.</p>

		<p>I lean Libertarian but can&rsquo;t commit because of this open borders stuff. Open borders will never work and any area that is open is doomed to fail, sooner or later a strong man emerges to bring order to the chaos and then the fun begins.</p>
<p>To #19 China is far from Homogeneous there are hundreds of dialects and many different ethnic types. The main people who run the government are descendants of Han Chinese and consider themselves to be the True Chinese. Look at the part of China with the ethnic Muslim Uyghurs China is claiming to have a lot of terrorist problems with them and really cracking down. Whether this is true or not remains to be seen it may be just an excuse to bust some Muslim heads as the Communist don&rsquo;t take to kindly to religion.</p>

<p>No, the heart of the immigration issue is the genetics - the RACE -  of the immigrants. Is it not true that the United States would be far worse off if all the now illegal immigrants were legal? After all, then they would qualify for even more services, could vote, etc., and proceed at full speed to destroy what is left of the United States.</p>
<p>Immigration policy should be set not only based on the existing population level of the country (which is already too high as it is), but, even more importantly, based on the GENETICS of the people allowed in, because their genetics determines the quality of future generations of their offspring.</p>
<p>It has been said (I do not know the origin of the quote) that immigration is inherently a selfish business. That is, immigrants do not come into a country to improve it, but rather to better their own lives. Therefore, the citizens of every country have a right and a duty to ensure that every immigrant, as well as their future descendants, will result in a net benefit to the country.</p>
<p>The long term lasting effects of immigration are changes to a country&rsquo;s population and gene pool. Therefore, immigration policy should be determined on that basis.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I find the content of the article more upsetting or some of the comments I am reading underneath it.</p>
<p>Here is my analysis:</p>
<p>1) This isn&rsquo;t a matter of legal vs. illegal immigration.  We need to halt all immigration. Look at the percentage of people in this country who are unemployed.  </p>
<p>2) The only people we should be letting in are white people around the world getting persecuted (just as Jared Taylor says&hellip;.aka South Africa).</p>
<p>3) America does just fine without nonwhite &#8220;intellect&#8221;.  Where were all the Asians when Americans were putting men on the moon?</p>
<p>4) I also think people are exaggerating with their suggestions about whites being as equally lazy as blacks, which is why we need hispanics.  Give me a break!  Maybe once you yourselves experience unemployment and what it is like, you won&rsquo;t be making such suggestions ever again. Most white people are willing to work.  I can&rsquo;t really say the same for certain other groups.</p>
<p>Times are going to start getting rough if people don&rsquo;t wise up about this stuff. And it really scares me, considering how young I am at the moment, thinking of what the future holds.  </p>
<p>Start doing your part by ceasing to go to nonwhite doctors.  Stop using companies for your internet and phone service who do nothing but connect you to a nonwhite person with an accent when you call in with a problem. Start hiring the white teenager who lives down the street from you to mow your lawn. </p>
<p>Wake up people! I am losing patience with whites who just don&rsquo;t get it!  Especially older whites from the 60s generation who don&rsquo;t give a care about the Third World nightmare they are bequeathing to those of us who are younger.  The thought terrifies me! Inexcusible!</p>

		<p>Typical libertarian view. They look at the issue in the short term and only with an economic lens. What they don&rsquo;t realize is the massive negative societal effects of immigration and that those underpaid immigrant masses tend ultimately not to be friends of a free market economy and vote accordingly. </p>

		<p>So Jeffery Tucker thinks we could comfortably accommodate a population of 3 billion people?  The man is an idiot.  Most of that &#8220;wasteland&#8221; he flies over consists of farmland growing wheat, corn, and other staples.  If they weren&rsquo;t there those of us in cities and suburbs would starve.  Most of the rest is desert.  There the population is limited by the availability of fresh water.  Already there is constant conflict over water usage in western states, and it only gets worse as the population grows.</p>
<p>Also, what some of us like about America, and why we prefer it to Europe or Japan, is that it does still have significant wilderness and open space.  We would like it to stay that way.  We think cougars and elk and bears need a place to live.  We like to hike and fish and hunt.  We don&rsquo;t want the whole damn place paved over from end to end the way the open borders libertarians do.</p>
<p>Another reason that guy is an idiot is that he thinks that mass immigration of third worlders will save us from welfare statism.  Quite to the contrary.  Michael Moore said that he couldn&rsquo;t wait for whites to become a minority so that socialism will be voted in.  At least Moore is honest in explaining his reasons for wanting to replace the electorate.  Note that the vast majority of people who support libertarian leaning Ron Paul (who fortunately does not support illegal immigration) are white.  Only a small minority of blacks and Latinos are fired up by a message about liberty, limited government, and a document written by Dead White Males, when the alternative is a welfare check or a cushy affirmative action government job.  Indeed 90% of blacks and two thirds of Latinos vote Democratic, and the Democrats are a very statist party.</p>

If they were that enterprising, why can they not build their native Countries into first world advanced ones.<br>
America did not need them to pioneer space travel and nuclear technology and America still does not need them now. It is they who need America because they cannot build a society like America in the first place. These people like the the cuckoo bird are brood parasites who cannot build its own nest but lays its eggs in nests already built by other birds. They are not hardworking at all. The real hard work is to BUILD a great society in the first place, not to immigrate (whether legally or not) into an already built one. BUILD yours if you can. They can&rsquo;t.</p>

At someone else&rsquo;s expense. At Mr and Mrs Whiteman&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>There are not enough real jobs to support more people, and there isn&rsquo;t enough CHEAP fertile land for people to grow their own food or raise animals to support themselves all year. Another factor is clean water.</p>

		<p> &#8220;I look around at the native bourgeoisie in this country and see incredible dependency, sloth, debt, and the absence of the enterprising spirit of 19th century legend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes&hellip;.Well, it&rsquo;s expected that many 3rd world &#8220;immigrants&#8221; would have that &ldquo;enterprising spirit,&#8221; especially when uncle Sam antes up tax payer dollars to make it happen. Especially in the land where minority status means access to all kinds of financial assistance to make your entrepreneurial dreams a reality. </p>
<p>I remember back in the late 70&rsquo;s, early 80&rsquo;s when several Vietnamese families moved into our neighborhood. Never mind the fact they seemingly came literally with only the shirts on their back and didn&rsquo;t speak a word of English. That in of itself might lead one to wonder how they were able to afford a home in this upper middle class neighborhood. Sure they lived slam jam style, but who&rsquo;s paying attention.</p>
<p>In any event, within three years they were ALL driving luxury vehicles and had their own business, i.e., donut shop, nail salon, dry cleaners, liquor store, etc., to boot. </p>
<p>These Vietnamese were able to accomplish in three years what would have taken White Americans perhaps decades to accomplish. How did a group of uneducated, 3rd world immigrants turn out so well unless our government was providing substantial financial assistance to make sure the so called &#8220;enterprising spirit&#8221; flourished?</p>
