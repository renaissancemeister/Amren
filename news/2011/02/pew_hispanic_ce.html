			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FAIR Legislative Update, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to a new report issued by the Pew Hispanic Center, illegal aliens gave birth to eight percent of the newborns in the U.S. from March 2009 to March 2010. The report revealed that within the time period studied, 350,000 newborns had at least one illegal alien parent, up 10,000 from the previous year. Of the illegal aliens having babies in 2009-2010, nine percent had arrived in the U.S. in 2008 or later. Thirty percent of the illegal aliens arrived in the U.S. between 2004 and 2007, with the remaining illegal aliens having arrived sometime before 2004. The report also revealed that 17 percent of newborns had parents who are legal immigrants, meaning that 26 percent of those born in the U.S. this last year were to non-natives.</p>

		<p>&#8220;illegal aliens gave birth to eight percent of the newborns in the U.S. &#8220;</p>
<p>Does that eight percent also include births to those on tourist and student visas? I doubt it does. So the percentage of births to people who aren&rsquo;t fully &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction&#8221; of the US is probably higher than 10 percent. And then we wonder why more than half of newborns are now nonwhite. Births to illegal aliens and visa holders is the driving force behind this demographic crisis. </p>

		<p>What a crock. The Pew Hispanic Center is selling itself short. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s at least double that, and that&rsquo;s being conservative.</p>

		<p>Well, friends, this CANNOT be a surprise!!!  I saw a report today that said it costs us $338BILLION per year to keep illegal aliens in this country, and it&rsquo;d cost $46BILLION per year to deport &#8216;em all   &mdash;   hey, no brainer, folks!!!</p>

		<p>Two things on this one: </p>
<p>One&hellip;we can just forget about taxes being lowered, or just expect to be receiving even less money in income tax returns because of one little &#8220;secret&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Two: Border patrol is appearantly missing quite a few &#8220;jumpers&#8221;.</p>

<p>There are few stories which catch me by surprise but I had no idea it was that many. The US simply must prevent anchor babies from fraudulently obtaining citizenship. Retroactively.</p>

		<p>Only 8%? They might want to recheck figures. I&rsquo;d have expected that at least 50% of Latinos born in our country are to illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>I also doubt the data.  It is much more.  One only has to look around and see the foreign baby boom.  Fed subsidies has created a nation of reproduction entitlements. It has been the platform of DNC for decades. Check out the number of subsidies that encourage out of wedlock births. It is UnConstitutional and it is against core American values. It was legislated to do exactly what we see&hellip;. increase foreigns into USA to pay for DNC votes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GOP is asleep at the wheel unconscious about the deceit and money laundry offense put upon US taxpayers. No one is standing for the Constitution or for American citizens.  Political money laundry is merging Huffy Post with AOL.<br>

Where does all their newly created largesse go???    </p>

		<p>And another 15% are anchor babies with faux US citizenship giving birth. The next generation you know. In any event, if the Pew says it 8%, you can easily double the number and feel comfortable, since the Pew has a tendency to underestimate numbers so as not to attract attention to the reconquista which is in overdrive.</p>
