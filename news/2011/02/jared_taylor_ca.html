			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Tuggle, Examiner (Charlotte), January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor held an outdoors news conference at the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Governmental Center on January 31st, a raw, cold day. Despite the weather, all the major news organizations attended, including Mi Gente, a Spanish-language publication.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We think better of Charlotte than this,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;We call on Patrick Cannon and Warren Turner to consider how their actions soil the reputation of their city. We believe they should support free speech. We believe they should take a stand for genuine tolerance of a genuine diversity of ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor, who calls himself a &#8220;race realist,&#8221; said that his group openly advocates for &#8220;white interests.&#8221; No one in Charlotte objected, he said, when the Latino advocacy group La Raza, which he translated as &#8220;The Race,&#8221; met there, nor did local government take action when Louis Farrakhan visited, even though Farrakhan has made statements that Taylor characterized as &#8220;vile things&#8221; about Jews and whites, such as claiming the US government purposely flooded New Orleans to kill blacks.</p>
<p>The reporter for Mi Gente asked Taylor if his group was white supremacist. He responded that the people of Japan or Israel or Mexico could be called &#8220;supremacist&#8221; because of those nations&rsquo; strict enforcement of immigration laws. Then he asked the reporter a question. &#8220;Your paper is called &#8216;Mi Gente,&rsquo; which means &#8216;my people.&rsquo; Who are your people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone,&#8221; she said, raising her hands in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone?&#8221; Taylor asked.</p>
<p>The reporter shrugged. &#8220;The entire Latino community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor pounced on this. &#8220;And if you wanted to associate with your people, or hold a conference, do you think you would be allowed to do so here in Charlotte?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One group that made no bones about their intention not to support free speech showed up as well. Five protestors who said they were members of Anti-Racist Action approached Taylor. With members of the Charlotte police poised at the edge of the courtyard, one of the protesters yelled obscenities at Taylor as he began to speak.</p>
<p>When Taylor concluded his Q&A;, the reporters turned to the black-garbed protestors. One of them, Michael Behrle, boasted, &#8220;American Renaissance will not hold a convention in Charlotte. If they try, it&rsquo;ll be just like Canada,&#8221; referring to the violent disruption of the American Renaissance conference in Halifax in January, 2007.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds hypocritical,&#8221; said one bystander.</p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor, </p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t paying attention.  </p>
<p>The blacks always get what they demand because they use logos, ethos, and pathos, but mostly pathos.  You left that out, and you only used logos.  </p>
<p>You must shame those who violated your rights. The entire success of Integration and Civil Rights was done upon the weakness of White Humanity for pathos rhetoric.</p>
<p>Start telling how painful it is to live in a country where you can&rsquo;t count on elected officials to uphold your civil rights and freedoms.  Complain about the hurt.  You should demand that they recognized your pain, acknowledge their faults, apologize for the violation, and heal the wounds of your community by repairing the damage by writing you a big check and undergoing sensitivity training.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, you are too smart and experienced to have missed this opportunity at turning the tables on the enemies of White Humanity.  We expect you to be more clever than you are acting. Are you tired and despairing? At least rise to the occasion and set an example for the younger generation by giving us a proven tactic when fighting against our sworn enemies.</p>
<p>Thank you for reconsidering your methods at getting your own restorative justice.  We just can&rsquo;t afford continuing to use failing tactics. Help move us forward by using the proven tricks of the past so we can have a better future for our people.  Adopt wholesale the vocabulary of the Civil Rights struggle and the Diversity Mandate. </p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Whitey White<br>

<p><br>
Uh, no it won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Jared Taylor&rsquo;s speech in Halifax was a free event which anybody could   &mdash;   and unfortunately did   &mdash;   just walk in off the street and disrupt. </p>
<p>Attendance at an AR conference must be booked in advance. You have to check in. You don&rsquo;t get in the room unless you&rsquo;ve paid, you&rsquo;re on the list, and you&rsquo;re wearing a jacket and tie. </p>
<p>And even if one of you mentally-ill, morally-bankrupt, fascistically-inclined &#8220;antifascist&#8221; hooligans did happen to meet all those requirements and somehow actually got inside the conference hall, and you started trying to do to Mr. Taylor what you did in Canada, this time he will have 200 or more supporters there happy to show you the door. </p>

		<p>Whitey White is on to something very powerful and indispensable for our community&rsquo;s cause.  Let us make ourselves worthy of the advice.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor should get the police reports from the local area and find all the mentions of black suspects, then hold these up and ask why the black city councilmen, NAACP, and all other anti-White Humanity thugs are worrying about old, powerless White men instead of demanding that the &#8220;communities of color&#8221; do more policing against thugs and citizenship training of their &#8220;youth&#8221;.  What are they doing to teach the harm of rap lyrics? Ask why they attack Taylor while they should be out looking for suspects who fit the descriptions of the violent perp.  Point at their failures when you fight back. Demand they explain why they have abandoned their communities to criminal blacks and focus their attention on peaceful Whites. Demand that all the Officers of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion be called to account for not doing their part at making dangerous black neighborhoods less violent.  Demand all White Diversity Worshippers start explaining why they aren&rsquo;t exporting the White Diversity into &#8220;troubled, but promising&#8221; black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>START HOLDING THEM ALL ACCOUNTABLE!!! That&rsquo;s how the game is played, and until you play it by the winning team&rsquo;s rules, you will just keep looking pathetic.</p>
<p>You really do have an opportunity here to teach White America how to ask the right questions whenever blacks start making nuisances of themselves, which is always, and is always typical.</p>
<p>We need a new typical response. They will shy away from attacking us when we wave the &#8220;black crime reports&#8221; from their own neighborhoods in their faces.  They most fear White Humanity regaining our sanity and our forthcoming reappraisal of the importance of negotiation instead of surrender.  </p>
<p>White Humanity is ready for the new message- we want change- we demand transformation: Transcend Diversity Always, Embrace Whiteness Only, Beware and Prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip;</p>
<p>Jesse Jackson claims that &#8220;black folks are the moral story of this country.&#8221;  Taylor should use his own recent notoriety to compare the pathologies in black neighborhoods in Charlotte with the claim of &#8220;moral story&#8221;.   Just go ahead and agree, &#8220;Yes, Jesse, you are the moral story, and we want to know why your community had failed to understand MLK&rsquo;s call for &#8220;peaceful, non-violent social change&#8221;.   Start teaching White America to accept the morality of black violence on its face value. What they do, is who they are.  The iron laws of nature will not be broken.<br>

<p>I wonder if one of those protestors was the one Taylor approached in the video accompanying one of today&rsquo;s stories, and who refused to shake Taylor&rsquo;s hand. In the scene just prior to that, it sounded like someone called Mr. Taylor over. Maybe he thought Mr. Taylor would be afraid to approach him, but Taylor showed him otherwise.</p>

		<p>Poster #1 may be on to something.  In high school rhetoric classes, students are taught to use all three types of rhetoric: ethos (the validity of the speaker and the relevance of the information given to the audience), logos (factual arguments), and pathos (emotional appeal).  American Renaissance has a lot of logos and ethos, to be sure, but not very much pathos.  Some nationalist institutions, such as the UK&rsquo;s British National Party, do use pathos effectively.  Perhaps we could learn from them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The reporter for Mi Gente asked Taylor if his group was white supremacist. He responded that the people of Japan or Israel or Mexico could be called &ldquo;supremacist&rdquo; because of those nations&rsquo; strict enforcement of immigration laws. Then he asked the reporter a question. &ldquo;Your paper is called &lsquo;Mi Gente,&rsquo; which means &lsquo;my people.&rsquo; Who are your people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone,&rdquo; she said, raising her hands in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone?&rdquo; Taylor asked.</p>
<p>The reporter shrugged. &ldquo;The entire Latino community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor pounced on this. &ldquo;And if you wanted to associate with your people, or hold a conference, do you think you would be allowed to do so here in Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hypocrisy emanating from hispanics on this issue is astounding. With groups like La Raza &#8220;The race&#8221; and no less than a dozen other groups specifically in existence to advocate on behalf of  illegal invading Hispanics, exclusively, makes one wonder how they could have the bravado to question anyone regarding the issue of race!</p>
<p>Ditto for blacks as well! We can have a Supreme Court Justice who is a card carrying member of la raza and a POTUS who was a member of a black liberationist church for over twenty years, whereby the MSM didn&rsquo;t scrutinize whatsoever! </p>
<p>But if you happen to be White and desire to belong to a group that advocates on behalf of our race, you&rsquo;re ostracized, while your Constitutional Rights are all but trampled.</p>
<p>Can their be any doubt remaining that our government is permanently trying to eradicate the White race from society, specifically by allowing some 20 million hispanics to enter this country in violation of our immigration laws and then demanding they be given amnesty as a reward for their actions!<br>

<p>Personally, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt my feeling if Charlotte was wiped off the map as it is becoming (has become) just a piece of Detroit or chiCONGO in the South. As little as 10 years ago it was a safe, mostly white city, now!!! not so much of either!</p>

		<p>Poster #1 and #7 did an excellent job defining rhetoric and the various types that should be used to make our case. If you notice, black and hispanic supremacy groups (la raza, naacp, just to name a few - there are dozens more as you know) have mastered the art of using mainly pathos (emotional appeal) to make their case. </p>
<p>Specifically la raza and other hispanic supremacy groups when advocating on behalf of the 20+ million hispanic illegal invaders, in the process of colonizing our country. It seems to have worked for them thus far, as they do not have the facts or the rule of law on their side. What they do have is the unrelenting capacity to continue to use terms like &ldquo;racists, xenophobes, and nativists&rdquo; for anyone who believes in the rule of law against their colonizing raza. DCleraly, such terms are designed to elicit an emotional response.<br>
 <br>
The White race must do more of this, as facts (logos) and the rule of law (ethos) seemingly do not matter to those we are fighting against. <br>

Right on! about the need for reclaiming the lost art of Western rhetoric. One would assume that a group that advocates White interest would have that subject down packed! After all, it is a great part of our Western heritage. Race isn&rsquo;t all about biology guys   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s cultural too! <br>

		<p>Perhaps next time, choose a majority white city to hold the conference. Charlotte is 49.9% white, 33.5% black, 11% Hispanic or Latino. I think most white American towns would welcome the conference. Also, where did the hotel get the money for the cancellation fee, after losing all the conference money?</p>

		<p>There also need to be formed militant pro-white organizations to counter the antifa traitors. This does not begin by advertising as such, but by building pro-white social groups, based on American nationalist principles (as opposed to white nationalist, though in practice there will be tremendous overlap, as our enemies will understand) which can be radicalized over time. We are in a war for racial survival. The operative word is WAR. </p>

<p>Most WN organizations are run by men and do not use pathos effectively. For the WN to go mainstream we need to appeal to the average women, the soccer mom for example, and that is why pathos is so important. </p>
<p>Here is one of the very rare examples of WN propaganda using Pathos, this is video was produced by Julian Lee a poster I came across on a similar site.</p>

		<p>The reason for this unawareness of the frightening danger to our country and to the entire free world is simple. The masterminds behind this great conspiracy have absolute control of all of our mass-communications media, especially television, the radio, the press, and Hollywood. We all know that the State Department, the Pentagon, and the White House have brazenly proclaimed that they have the right and the power to manage the &ldquo;news&rdquo;, to tell us not the truth but what they want us to believe. They have seized that power on orders from their masters of the great conspiracy and the objective is to brainwash the people into accepting the phony peace bait to transform the United States into an enslaved unit of the United Nations&rsquo; &ldquo;New World Order/Global Government&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in the midst of a phase of history in which nations will be redefined and their futures fundamentally altered.&rdquo; –Rupert Murdoch, CEO Fox News, Feb 24, 2009</p>
<p>Those who are asking for more government interference are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom.  &mdash;  Ludwig von Mises</p>

		<p><i>The blacks always get what they demand because they use logos, ethos, and pathos, but mostly pathos. You left that out, and you only used logos.</i></p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s high time to fight fire with fire and make use of our enemies strategies, strategies that do not come from blacks or hispanics.</p>
<p>Blacks have neither the intelligence nor organizational skills necessary to get what they want.  They are front men, useful idiots and pawns for the hostile elite agitators behind them, those with IQs ~ three to four standard deviations above those of blacks.  </p>
<p>Make no mistake:  Their true target of destruction is White America.  And we are losing this battle, demographically and morally.</p>
<p>What the hostile elite masters use in their scorched earth policy is Alinsky&rsquo;s playbook, Rules for Radicals:</p>
<p>We would do well to heed Alinsky&rsquo;s screeds:</p>
<p><i>What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be&hellip; Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take power away [from the haves].</i></p>
<p>And strategies:</p>
<p><i>True revolutionaries do not flaunt their radicalism. They cut their hair, put on suits and infiltrate the system from within. The trick is to penetrate existing institutions such as churches, unions and political parties.</i></p>
<p><i>Time magazine once wrote that &#8216;American democracy is being altered by Alinsky&rsquo;s ideas.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Both Hilary Clinton and Barak Obama worship at the altar of Alinsky:</p>
<p>Hilary wrote her senior honors thesis on Alinsky, which the Clintons later tried to hide and Obama:  <i>spent years teaching workshops on the Alinsky method.</i></p>
<p>Alinsky dedicated Rules for Radicals:  <i>to Lucifer, the very first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom.</i></p>
<p>In the narrative of Rules for Radicals, Alinsky advocates the following: <i>one thing that inner-city organizers want to do to whites is **** on them. Nothing is off limits.</i></p>
<p>Got it?</p>
<p>Folks, this is what we are up against, the tactics that the government, media and academia are using against us, straight out of the Alinsky handbook, using blacks and hispanics as pawns to carry out their War on White America.  We can&rsquo;t fight this unless we&rsquo;re fully aware of it and it deserves nothing less than a full frontal attack in return.  Our lives and our survival depend on fighting this beast.</p>
<p>Here is a superb article on Alinsky&rsquo;s tactics from<i>Investor&rsquo;s Business Daily</i></p>

		<p>The idea of using pathos is an interesting one but I am not sure that it is the right way to go. What we do not want to do is legitimize the kinds of arguments that minorities use. There are simply no logical or ethical grounds for outlawing the hanging of nooses or the distribution of cotton balls, for example. Such laws depend entirely on pathos  &mdash;  on how such actions (allegedly) make people feel. If we begin arguing that we are offended, hurt, traumatized, made to feel bad about ourselves, etc, and use that pain as a premise in an argument, we are only agreeing that such premises carry weight. We would, in effect, be saying that it certainly should not be permitted to hurt anyone&rsquo;s feelings but our feelings are being hurt as well. This is entirely counterproductive. </p>

		<p>Pathos means persuading by appealing to the audience&rsquo;s emotions. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean being pathetic or whiny. Pathos can mean inspiring pride, fear, sympathy, a sense of family, anything that touches on EMOTION. The best spin doctors and politicians always use Pathos because IT WORKS! However for logically minded people like Mr. Taylor it takes a concerted effort as logical fact based arguments seem more natural to them.</p>
<p>To win the battle, to win the hearts and minds of the mainstream White population Pathos is absolutely necessary. </p>

		<p>Respectfully, it is my view that using the &#8220;Louis Farrakhan litmus test&#8221; is kind of weak. If you want to have a conference of like-minded ideologues and scholars to discuss issues relevant to your cause, then do so. Fight based on that, however, the sniveling &#8220;oh, you let Farrakhan speak and he said bad things&#8221; sounds childish. The reason Farrakhan has been able to speak is because he is unapologetic and consistent in his views. They also make use of an internal security force which reduces the chances of things getting out of hand to nearly zero.</p>
