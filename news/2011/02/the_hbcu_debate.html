<h1>The HBCU Debate: Are Black Colleges &amp; Universities Still Needed?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robin White Goode, Black Enterprise, February 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Although most have a majority Black student body, the faculty at many HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] is strikingly diverse, sometimes more than 50% non-Black. Moreover, these institutions have never discriminated on the basis of race.</p>
<p>But, in an age of increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the U.S., do we still need HBCUs?</p>
<p>Chancellor Charlie Nelms of North Carolina Central University [4] in Durham says yes. &#8220;HBCUs provide a culturally affirming, psychologically supportive environment. Students don&rsquo;t have to prove they belong here.&#8221; NCCU provides its students &#8220;intentional, intrusive, focused&#8221; academic assistance, says Nelms.</p>
<p>HBCUs represent about 3% of colleges in the U.S. but enroll 12% of all Black college students and produce 23% of all Black college graduates. Remarkably, this small group of colleges confers 40% of all STEM degrees and 60% of all engineering degrees earned by Black students. They also educate half of the country&rsquo;s Black teachers and 40% of all Black health professionals. And they do this with much less funding support than that of traditionally White institutions.</p>
<p>Solange Sayers, a graduating senior at Grambling State University [5]in Grambling, Louisiana, has been very happy with her HBCU experience. Originally from St. Lucia, Sayers was elected Miss Grambling last year. {snip}</p>
<p>One challenge she did encounter at Grambling was the school&rsquo;s unpreparedness for the influx of internationals that came on campus in 2006  &mdash;  500 students from Africa, Belize, Haiti, Nepal, and the West Indies. &#8220;Even dealing with our accents proved trying,&#8221; recalls Sayers. {snip}<br/>
Tyron Young, a senior at Morehouse College [6]in Atlanta, initially considered attending the University of Maryland but changed his mind after talking with the assistant principal at his high school, a charter school in Baltimore called National Academy. &#8220;The idea of attending a Black school appealed to me,&#8221; Young says. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had experiences here I would never have had anywhere else  &mdash;  singing backup for Aretha Franklin and on a soundtrack for Spike Lee, for example.&#8221; Young, who plans to teach, also has received a Bill and Camille Cosby scholarship and talks with Bill Cosby personally.</p>
<p>Young grew up in Baltimore surrounded by African Americans and attended schools that were all Black, so for college he wanted the comfort and familiarity of a majority Black student body with which he would share certain commonalities. Yet, he enjoys working with all kinds of people: He is now working with a racially diverse group to establish a student mentoring program in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Marc Lamont Hill [7], host of Black Enterprise&rsquo;s Our World television show and Associate Professor of Education at Columbia University Teachers College, says HBCUs must be supported, especially because of the way they value their students and work to increase their students&rsquo; confidence. But he says there are problems the schools must address. An issue Hill sees as particularly regressive is the cultural conservatism that he says pervades all HBCUs: for example, rules forbidding choices like dreadlocks or braids or mandating attendance at chapel services. &#8220;These schools have only a veneer of progressivism,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Many don&rsquo;t even have African American studies departments, and many are anti-gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In spite of the nurturing HBCUs provide their students, their graduation rates are lower (about 38%) than that of Black students who attend traditionally White schools (about 46%). But this may be more a reflection of the student body HBCUs serve, one that is typically less affluent (65% of HBCU students are eligible for Pell Grants [9]), often less prepared academically, and often first generation college students. And HBCUs typically have tiny endowments; others struggle with debt. So obtaining resources that could help struggling students avoid dropping out isn&rsquo;t always an option.</p>
<p>Nelms points out, however, that the variation among HBCUs is actually greater than that between HBCUs and traditionally White institutions. Spelman College [10], for example, has an outstanding graduation rate of 80%  &mdash;  one of the highest in the nation  &mdash;  with 40% of its students Pell Grant eligible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a report released in December, &#8220;The Educational Effectiveness of Historically Black Colleges and Universities,&#8221; {snip} By the 1990s, however, there was a 20% decline in the relative wages of HBCU grads compared with Black students who graduated from non-HBCUs, although SAT scores of students accepted into HBCUs had also risen during that same period.</p>

		<p>They are glorified middle schools. </p>
<p>And, if they are permitted to be &#8220;historically black,&#8221; then we should have the option of &#8220;historically white&#8221; colleges.</p>
<p>In the end, blacks only embarrass themselves because everyone knows these schools are a joke educationally and a corrupt money pit on the management side.</p>
<p>Does anyone take these schools seriously? </p>

Because ultimately, it&rsquo;s not about the type of university you go to, but the kind of student you are. And whites tend (on average) to be better students than blacks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I am not at all surprised that the majority of the faculty at HBCUs are non-black. After all, a moderately intelligent black can probably get a much better position, thanks to affirmative action, at an HWCU (Historically White College or University). By contrast, an equally intelligent white will be shut out of elite university faculty, and will have to settle for a job elsewhere, even if it&rsquo;s at an HBCU.</p>

<p>Except to fill government-mandated AA requirements:</p>
<p>A very bright black colleague I work with sent her daughter to an HBCU in the deep south. Daughter was a fair to middling high school student who wanted the &#8220;black experience.&#8221; She wanted out after a few weeks, complained of the condition of the campus (dirty and filthy) and level of the other students (dumb and dumber as she put it).  Tuition was paid via black-only grants and &#8220;scholarships.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there she was offered internships, partnerships and mentorships with professionals from any/all career categories.  Companies twisted themselves into knots to sponsor black students from the HBCU.  During the summer, students were offered paid summer jobs plus traveling expenses at places such as NASA and Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Daughter is about to graduate and says every major corporation one can name from all part of the US are falling all over themselves to hire &#8220;graduates.&#8221;  If the students receives a diploma, they&rsquo;re in.  No one looks at grades or test scores or accomplishments.</p>

		<p>the first comment was from Mars.The aforementioned commenter said Blacks would wind up with a &#8220;college loan debt&#8221;.He is obviously delerious or insane. Blacks dont pay for college. NO way.No how.The only people who pay are Whites. Everyone else rides free.Whites for the most part are not allowed into Ivy League schools. Thats reserved for Jews,Asians and of course, unqualified Blacks.In the second and third tier schools which we are still allowed to attend;we pay and pay and pay. Sometimes for the rest of our lives. I dont think a single Black has paid for college in America in the last forty years.</p>

		<p>I have no problem with all-black schools.  Let blacks self-segregate.  But I do have a problem with federal subsidies for them.  We provide upwards of $500 million in public dollars each year to HBCUs, especially Howard.  With a current budget deficit of more than $1.5 trillion, it&rsquo;s time to pull the plug.</p>

		<p>A moderately intelligent black (top 10%, IQ-wise) can probably get his tuition at a middle-tier college and most of his other college expenses paid through scholarships and financial aid that a white could only get if he was in the top 1%,intelligence-wise, and a high-school workaholic to boot. <br/>
The Ivy Leagues bring in lots of foreign students (many from wealthy families that essentially bribe the universities to get their scions in), hence American-born whites are an extreme rarity in such places.</p>

<p>Boy, are you on the money. I first saw AA as a law student (naturally, I was paying and working my way through) in the early 70s.  If a student was black, regardless of need, regardless of ability or expectation of graduation, he or she was given money and remedial classes.  (I&rsquo;m not kidding, and this was LAW school.)  I told my son, who was a National Merit Finalist and (U.S.) Presidential scholar (top tenth of top one  percent of all students in the U.S.), not to even bother applying to Ivy League schools. Two of his friends did make it into Yale: one was an Italian-American female, admittedly brilliant and valedictorian, the other was of Chinese ancestry, whose grades, SATs and other criteria were less than my son&rsquo;s.  Same with MIT: in our upper-middle class town, the only kids getting into MIT in the past few years have been white females and Asian males.  My son did apply and make it into some highly-rated and high-priced private universities.</p>

		<p>Just a couple of notes of interest here. </p>
<p>1. About 15-20 years ago the nursing program was closed down for about a year because they were not meeting standards.</p>
<p>2. My husband, born and raised here in NC, told me that many years ago NCCU stood for North Caorlina Colored University.  </p>

		<p>So the HBCU are turning out engineers and doctors and lawyers.  Hmm, next time you cross that new bridge or ride up the elevator in that new skyscraper or just before you go under for that heart surgery, remember this, your HBCU educated professional may have bought his degree.  I refer to the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Fl.  Recently it was discovered that a couple of brothers hacked the school&rsquo;s grading system and changed a whole bunch of bad grades to really good grades for a whole bunch of students that purchased the altered grades.  Funny thing, as much as many of us tried to ask about what will happen to the students, we could never get an official response.  Oh, this follows closely on the heels of a massive fraud where millions just vanished from the school administration and there was the scandal at the credit union where the manager stole money and then there was the teacher&rsquo;s certification program that was closed down because no one could pass the certification tests and then there was the law school that had to be closed and then there was, sorry for the run on, you get the point, don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>Are these issue exclusive to black colleges? I don&rsquo;t thunk so. How many graduates historically of so-called selective colleges at best fit in the profile of &#8220;moderately bright and can pay for it&#8221;? Isn&rsquo;t every kind of college for a lot of the students &#8220;a great opportunity to fool around for four or five years, get a worthless piece of paper and an attitude that says they are educated&#8221; when they are not?</p>
<p>Room for criticism, but try to apply it more broadly. The college system deserves your best effort!</p>
