<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41466543/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">Armed Rooster Kills Calif. Man</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A California man attending a cockfight has died after being stabbed in the leg by a bird that had a knife attached to one of its limbs.</p>
<p>The Kern County coroner says 35-year-old Jose Luis Ochoa was declared dead at a hospital about two hours after he suffered the injury in neighboring Tulare County on Jan. 30.</p>
<p>An autopsy concluded Ochoa died of an accidental &#8220;sharp force injury&#8221; to his right calf.</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Ray Pruitt says it&rsquo;s unclear if a delay in seeking medical attention contributed to Ochoa&rsquo;s death. Tulare officials are investigating, and no arrests were made at the cockfight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When deputies arrived, people started fleeing,&#8221; Sgt. Martin King told kget.com in Bakersfield. &#8220;One of the roosters jumped at the decedent, inflicting some type of injury and causing his death.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What happened? Did Mr.Ochoa deflate? The gaffs and knives that cockfighters attach to their roosters are only around an inch long. They are never longer than an inch and a half. How do you die from that?</p>
<p>I suspect that when the toxicology report comes in the authorities will conclude that one of the cockfighters had figured out a way to cheat by dipping their gaffs and knives in some kind of powerful poison. </p>
<p>The practice of treating gaffs and knives with a deadly fish toxin used to be common in Thailand, but I have never heard of it in the Western Hemisphere. Cockfighters in Thailand are now expected to &#8220;taste&#8221; their rooster&rsquo;s knives or gaffs immediately before releasing their cocks into battle to prove that there is no foul play. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;A California man attending a cockfight has died after being stabbed in the leg by a bird that had a knife attached to one of its limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newsflash:</p>
<p>MSNBC, February 8, 2011. </p>
<p>Chris Mathews has launched an in depth overnight investigation of the above incident and found this radicalized rooster to be a racist cock. It was said to be a known member of the &ldquo;Tea Party&rdquo; and had planned to attend the cancelled American Renaissance conference scheduled for February 4 through 6 in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was angry that it could not deliver a speech entitled &ldquo;Chicken hawks and Mexicans, why their &lsquo;undocumented migrations&rsquo; have been encouraged by Chick-fil-A and cows.&rdquo; The wretched rooster was said also to have stocks in McDonalds, Outback Steak House, and Red Robin. While the knife wielding rooster had posted on his blog that he felt chickens and roosters were inferior to cows and bulls, Ernesto &#8220;Che&#8221; Guevara  and Colonel Sanders were his most admired historical figures, and that his favorite books were Das Kapital and Chicken Little, it is safe to assume he had psychopathic attachments to the racist right in this country. </p>
<p>After all, it murdered a Hispanic man named Ochoa, which is similar to Obama, the first African-American president. It doesn&rsquo;t take much to connect the dots here.</p>

		<p>Another example of customs and culture from another country being brought to the US. These people gladly participate in this illegal activity and will continue to do so at every opportunity in the name of preserving their culture. Too bad more roosters are not armed with knives to attack these criminals.</p>

		<p>Well I don&rsquo;t see how getting stabbed in the calf can cause death, but this does seem like some kind of poetic justice. Perhaps fear of prosecution caused the victim to avoid getting medical treatment, causing tetanus, which I guess can be fatal.</p>

		<p>An autopsy concluded Ochoa died of an accidental &ldquo;sharp force injury&rdquo; to his right calf.</p>
<p>As with most incidents of hispanic origin, this makes no sense.  How big was the knife that this rooster was wielding, and how strong was this rooster where it could muster enough force to kill a grown man by stabbing him in the calf?</p>
<p>And can this be considered an accident if the knife was deliberatelty attached to one of the rooster&rsquo;s limbs?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s got to be more to it than this. The blade must have been treated with some kind of poison or something. Wherever there are Mexicans, there is always trouble.</p>

		<p>I think he got what he deserves! I think anyone that hurts-kills an innocent animal for sport doesn&rsquo;t deserve to live themselves. I&rsquo;ve never understood how some people can go to these things and don&rsquo;t have a shread of sympathy for the animals, that goes for rodeos, bullfighting, circuses, zoos and rodeos also. These people cheer while the animals are terrified and fighting for their lives. Too bad they don&rsquo;t arm the roosters with guns!   </p>
