<h1>Emory &#8216;Regrets&rsquo; Slavery Ties, Holds Conference on Topic</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Diamond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The founders of Emory University owned slaves. They used slave labor to build the campus. Their pro-slavery views helped drive the North-South schism in the Methodist Episcopal Church leading up to the Civil War.</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s slave legacy doesn&rsquo;t end with the antebellum era. In 1902, the college forced a professor to resign for an article he wrote condemning lynching.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2003 when a professor&rsquo;s use of a racial slur led to campus-wide debates.</p>
<p>That incident spurred self-reflection.</p>
<p>Emory leaders created a program to research the university&rsquo;s past and talk about race. The program&rsquo;s work will be discussed during a four-day conference  &mdash;  beginning Thursday evening on campus  &mdash;  where about 30 public and private colleges will examine the role of slavery at institutions of higher learning in America. And, as the private college marks its 175th anniversary, the Board of Trustees released a statement of regret over Emory&rsquo;s involvement with slavery.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>President James Wagner said the statement allows Emory to be clear about its past.</p>
<p>The statement reads: &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Emory regrets both this undeniable wrong and the university&rsquo;s decades of delay in acknowledging slavery&rsquo;s harmful legacy. As Emory University looks forward, it seeks the wisdom always to discern what is right and the courage to abide by its mission of using knowledge to serve humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>An apology, Wagner said, could be viewed as &#8220;inappropriate and an attempt to force today&rsquo;s value and our own words in the mouths of the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students are reacting. An editorial in the student newspaper commended the statement and said the university must encourage discussion about race, diversity and other sensitive topics. About one-third of Emory&rsquo;s 13,381 students are minority.</p>
<p>While few colleges have offered a statement similar to Emory&rsquo;s, many are acknowledging their own pasts. Leaders from Brown University to Clemson University to University of Alabama have conducted similar reviews, said Mark Auslander, an anthropology professor at Brandeis University.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senior Patrick Jamieson will present a paper at the conference about Emory&rsquo;s &#8220;intellectual investment in slavery&#8221;  &mdash;  how professors and leaders used classroom lectures and scholarly activity to legitimize slavery.</p>

<p>We all know that this statement is a flatout lie.  What these leftist student&rsquo;s want is a one way lecture on the evils of white society.  They would be the first to shut down honest debate on racial issues.  </p>

		<p>As the prominent teaching hospital in the state, this &#8216;horrendous discovery&rsquo; hardly affects blacks or whites for that matter from flocking there for quality care.</p>
<p>Just once I would love to see an institution&rsquo;s response to accusations of slavery connections as being, &#8220;None of us were here at that time  - neither were any of you - so none of us have anything to apologize for. Now go away and let me get back to my work.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Were whites treated any better during the Industrial Revolution?</p>
<p>The life of a black slave in the U.S. south who lived a long existence of peaceful toil and freedom from hunger was conditionally superior to a white wage slave in Europe who perished from disease, poverty, famine, industrial accident or overwork.<br>

<p>And yet, a &#8216;White Privilege&rsquo; Conference is scheduled for the Sheraton Bloomington, in ritzy, &#8216;privileged&rsquo; Bloominton/Edina corridor in Minneapolis, this coming tax tide.</p>
<p>Black &#8216;scholars&rsquo; and other &#8216;mea culpists&rsquo; are going to diss White Culture, American society, and engage in what any other group would (if allowed to do so) be termed &#8216;racial profiling,&rsquo; &#8216;racist rhetoric,&rsquo; and &#8216;racial supremacist ideology&rsquo; (even in damning Whites for being&hellip;well, White!)</p>
<p>Can we PLEASE have threatening calls to the Sheraton, protestors outside, boycotts, just to show that &#8216;what&rsquo;s good for the goose, is also good for the gander&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Just to be &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; you understand?</p>

		<p>Nowhere did the original article specify the nature of the unnamed professor&rsquo;s 2003 &#8220;slur.&#8221;  Perhaps a slur in the context of Emory and other universities these days means accidentally telling the truth with a joke (as opposed to accidentally telling the truth without a joke).  </p>
<p>Laura Diamond didn&rsquo;t do her job.  Then again, if she did, she might be out of hers.  Here, then, is another example of lazy reporting from a daily paper I once held in high regard.  </p>

		<p>I have lived a few miles from Emory most of my life and even worked there in an office in the &#8216;80&rsquo;s (in fact, I was born  at the hospital there). It has had a &#8220;liberal&#8221; reputation for years, so it is indeed ironic that it has slavery connections.</p>

		<p>Seek, a prof used the expression &#8220;ni  &mdash;  er in a woodpile.&#8221; She did so openly. As Emory is &#8220;liberal&#8221;, as I said earlier, one would not expect that from anyone employed there. As a metro Atlantan, I heard all about it, of course, although surprisingly our local liberal rag reported on this non-news 6 weeks after the fact. The expression is so outdated (1920&rsquo;s or &#8216;30&rsquo;s) that I was also surprised that a middle-aged person in the yr. 2003 would use it. The Emory response was to agree to recruit more blacks as students, TA&rsquo;s, profs, and other employees. I was disgusted but not surprised by that nonsense. </p>
