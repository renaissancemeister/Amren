<h1>Racial Flaps Dog &rsquo;Bama Despite Progress</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Reeves, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Months after the University of Alabama dedicated a plaza and clock tower to its earliest black students, the school has been swamped with unwelcome attention over the past two weeks because of racial slurs used on campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School president Robert Witt has drawn praise for instituting programs to increase diversity. But it&rsquo;s student foibles that garner the national headlines, such as when a parade of white students in Confederate uniforms stopped in front of a black sorority house in 2009 and angered alumnae gathered for a party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2004, Brophy [Al Brophy, a University of North Carolina law professor who previously taught at Alabama] helped push the Faculty Senate at Alabama to issue a formal apology to the descendants of slaves who were owned by faculty members or who worked on campus during the antebellum period. The action was met on campus both with praise and complaints that it was pointless for anyone to apologize for the sins of the 1800s.</p>
<p>{snip} But while the student body is more than 12 percent black, the proportion is still small when compared to the state&rsquo;s population, which is 26 percent black.</p>
<p>Most galling to some is the fact that Alabama&rsquo;s Greek-letter social organizations remain segregated almost entirely by race, not by rule but by preference. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Given this lack of diversity, it is not surprising that some students feel discrimination and racism is okay,&#8221; the student newspaper, The Crimson White, said in an editorial last week.</p>
<p>The most recent flare-up began Feb. 4 when a white student was accused of yelling a slur from his fraternity house at a black student. The school has refused to reveal the student&rsquo;s punishment, but the national president of the fraternity, Delta Tau Delta, apologized personally to the black student.</p>
<p>Less than a week later, disparaging words were written about several ethnic and racial groups on three sidewalks near The Quad, a large campus green area. Administrators responded to each occurrence with campus-wide e-mails decrying intolerance, and an investigation continues into the written epithets.</p>
<p>In the 2009 incident, Rebel-garbed members of a fraternity holding its annual &#8220;Old South&#8221; parade paused in front of a gathering of alumnae celebrating their sorority&rsquo;s founding. After dozens of the women complained in letters, the fraternity banned members nationwide from wearing Confederate dress for the yearly parties.</p>

<p>How disgusting!  The VAST majority of the blacks in the school right now are there, because of AA not because they&rsquo;re qualified, yet comrad Reeves of the Atlanta Yellow Journalism sheet doesn&rsquo;t want to admit 12% is far above the percentage of blacks who would be there now if they were required to meet the same standards as the other students.</p>
<p>Sadly whites who are not aware of the situation today will likely utilize the services of these blacks when they get their AA degree, and will be victims to varying degrees of black incompetence.  God help them if they encounter these people to have their prescriptions filled or for medical reasons.</p>

		<p>Just did an image search of Southern belles and  Old South Parade etc&hellip; Saw some great pics of Southern belles in period costumes&hellip; I must say that they looked even better than in &#8220;cheer&#8221; attire!! And no gyrations either!!<br>
  Couple of constructive comments though from a guy who used to put on parties for 300+ every year.   Push the envelope a lil more each year! Some things I noticed were many flags adorning the hall, all of them silk screened nylon&hellip; Ouch!! Could someone in the group start making them by hand  out of cotton or silk instead? Then they would be good for every year after. Also saw that many parties were held in the school gym. How they got away with that, I don`t know But a hotel ballroom would have been a nice touch if affordable. And it hurt to see Southern belles drinking punch out of styrofoam cups. I know some grandmas must have real punch bowls. Details people! It`s all in the details. Like when my mom yelled at my brother for heading to the prom with holes in his socks. Look sharp, act sharp, be sharp!</p>

		<p>It can&rsquo;t be too bad at the University of Alabama, if the extent of racial problems over the last few years have been words yelled out of a window, words written on a sidewalk with chalk, and people in uniforms stopping in front of a house.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re white, it&rsquo;s a different matter.  Race relations at Alabama are very bad, because your every move and word is put under a microscope.</p>

<p>We should be ashamed that Whites still resist change.</p>
<p>The path the future is the path of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Academic elites who move us forward along that path will be &#8220;recognized,&#8221; which means better pay and status, while their own White Humanity suffers from dispossession.</p>
<p>Whites who offend blacks must be punished.</p>

		<p>I think people need to seriously GET that Southerners, both black and white, prefer to be segregated.  We don&rsquo;t want to date each other, we don&rsquo;t want to live next door to each other, we don&rsquo;t want to be roommates, and we don&rsquo;t want to socialize with each other.  It&rsquo;s OK to eat in the same room in a restaurant, stay in the same hotels (different rooms!), ride on the same bus, train or plane, and visit the same historical or scenic sites.  But the South is the South - we are proud of our heritage, and some things will NEVER change, no matter how hard the Northern aggressors try to force us to.</p>

		<p>As a public speaker on higher education, I have talked to a number of young people who are members of fraternities and sororities, mostly in the northwest and New England, and they tell me that there are many Greek organizations that have Black, Hispanic and Asian members. </p>
<p>I wonder if this is more regional than racial.</p>

		<p>Several months ago I made a comment on another post that discussed this topic of fraternities and sororities. I was a member of Delta Sigma Theta when I attended Hampton University from 1994-1998. I remember one poster who accused me of being a &#8220;White liberal troll&#8221; and levied other nonsensical charges against me.</p>
<p>However, I live here in Washington State, work on a college campus in student affairs in Tacoma and I see students across racial lines interacting with one another. I am  not saying that college campuses are a utopia, but I do not see things as divisive and fragmented as some people seem to be trying to make them out to be.    </p>

		<p>The disgraceful Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution was bought by a Ohio socialist back in the thirties.  It has sympathized with blacks from that day forward.  It is essentially a black run institution today.  Sane people long ago stopped reading that rag.  About the only thing that keeps it going are the automobile ads.</p>

		<p>Overall, the north is far more segregated than the south. Government data reveals the residential side, and my own observations as a Chicagoan tell me that the social scene is more segregated up here too. I have visited the south, and notice a big difference there. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the deal? Are southerners just less afraid, more attached to their home turf, or both, or what?</p>

<p>I live in Washington State also, and I have been on a few campuses and worked in a number of the state&rsquo;s communities.  Whites in Washington are notoriously liberal and comparatively opened to miscegenation, even in supposedly conservative areas like Chehalis and Centralia.  The campuses have Diversity Departments and hammer the theme ad nausea, obscuring natural actions.  The faculties seem to work overtime in locating and bringing non-white populations into the state for the sole purpose of a state paid education.  This seems to be part of the college business plan.  Whites in the Northwest are pretty dull witted too, when it comes to racial politics.  I have met many young white men who express shame at being white.  Being familiar with the King County Bar Association, I can tell you that it is run by a really naive bunch of airy-fairy feminists.  These are the ones who announced that henceforth, King County would be known as such in respect to MLK, not the historical British territory appellation. You cannot draw conclusions for the entire nation based on what goes on here in Washington State.  It is a case of intentional social liberalism gone ammuck for some time and the state has been dominated by liberals and has had a liberal female dominated government for nearly ten years now.  (Women have most of the cushy government jobs in Washington State by the way). </p>

<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; and &#8220;inclusion&#8221; are only for whites according to the govermedia, the goal being white displacement and demise.</p>
<p>If one be non-white, his path is one of ethno-centrism, pride in his &#8220;non-whiteness&#8221; and his own culture and traditions and govermedia encouragement to keep himself separate from mainstream white culture.<br>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t blacks see that these constant, petty whines make whites even more resentful and unwelcoming of them?  There must be something genetic about the tendency, but people with even a modicum of common sense should be able to control such impulses!  Of course, white liberals have taught them that whining is the way to go, and most blacks don&rsquo;t appear to realize that, at some point, their complaining reaches a saturation point.  And now that whites feel that their freedoms of speech, assembly, and association are under constant fire and restraint, mere resentment has turned into backlash.  </p>

		<p>8-Jeanette: &#8220;&hellip; I see students across racial lines interacting with one another. I am not saying that college campuses are a utopia, but I do not see things as divisive and fragmented as some people seem to be trying to make them out to be.&#8221;  I agree with this statement, but I don&rsquo;t believe this is the main, overall concern (then again, maybe it&rsquo;s just me). Most people of varying races tend to get along with one another, but in a mixed environment, humans prove time and again that we will intermarry, even if at a low percentage.  Nothing wrong with that for the individuals concerned, as I am glad when anyone finds happiness in their life. But when we have Black, Brown, and all-other immigrants coming into every White nation on earth in the massive numbers we see today, by nature we are guranteeing the extermination of the White races and of our associated culture. That isn&rsquo;t the only issue though, as the current White birth rate remains so low as to also diminish the White population.  Using Japan as an example of racial conservation, no matter what their birth rate is today, at some point they will return to a stable population. And with no immigration, that future population of Japan will be 100% Japanese.  We cannot say the same for Sweden, Germany, the UK, or any nation in Europe;  their immigration policies vitually ensure civil war with Islam and a future population that is ethnicly non-European. Sorry for going off subject, but I believe this is the underlying concern of many White Race-realist types.</p>

		<p>6-Unapologetic Southerner: &#8220;we are proud of our heritage, and some things will NEVER change, no matter how hard the Northern aggressors try to force us to.&#8221;:  I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want you to change in regard to being proud of who you are, as we should all carry such pride. I would question though, what I see as a -constant- anti-White-Northerner disposition coming from many White-Southerners.  Recently, comments were made about bringing a halt to the Southern bashing here on AMREN, when from what I see, most such comments are IN REPLY to comments such as either: 1) White Southerners are better than everyone else or, 2) White Southerners had so little to do with Slavery that they have less blame than anyone else.  As there is plenty of blame to go around, it makes it difficult to accept such statements without responding.  Basically though, I have to say that your sentiments are very much similar to mine regarding race. But if you and other White Southerners truly want just a separate White Southern nation, then so be it. I believe though, that we would be stronger, and have a much better chance at survival, if we worked together on race-realist type concerns and made efforts to move beyond the&hellip; War of Northern Aggression //Ouch!! Damn.. as a Northerner, it pains me to even say that&hellip; primarily due to the lack of totality of understanding such a statement entails. But if we can&rsquo;t breach the divide of our past, we pretty much guarantee we will have no future.<br>

		<p>So much to-do about absolutely NOTHING! Students reenacting a historical period dared to stop in front of a black sorority house? SHOCKING! A white student yelled a slur? How many black students yell slurs? Some words were chalked on a sidewalk? I mean, how petty can you get? </p>
<p>And whites always have to take these grievances on the part of blacks oh-so-seriously. As usual, though presumably written by a white writer, this MSM piece exclusively takes the point of view of blacks. This piece would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t so common.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because many, if not the majority, of black highschool graduates in the South go to historically black universities.  So, naturally, state schools are going to have a lower percentage of blacks.  Funny how the media always leaves this fact out when it laments the low percentage of blacks and public universities in the South.<br>
