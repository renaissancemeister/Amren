			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William Selway and Frank Bass, Bloomberg, February 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mike Tsamouras, the owner of a Baltimore bakery, watched his city shrink for five decades, leaving neighborhoods with rows of vacant homes, their marble steps leading to boarded-up doors.</p>
<p>As factory jobs disappeared, so did the people and the merchant stalls that once lined the sidewalk outside the 19th- century Hollins Market, where he works. During the 1970s, the city lost almost 1,000 residents a month as whites rattled by racial tensions moved to the suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The exodus, while not over, is slowing, according to 2010 Census data released yesterday. That may be a cause for celebration in a city that&rsquo;s long struggled to shake a battered image that was showcased in HBO&rsquo;s television crime drama &#8220;The Wire,&#8221; a stark portrait of an urban center in decline.</p>
<p>Baltimore&rsquo;s population fell by 30,193 residents to 620,961 in the past decade, the smallest 10-year decrease since the 1950s, census data show. The 4.6 percent drop followed a 12 percent slide in the 1990s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Hispanic Surge</b></p>
<p>The report on Baltimore&rsquo;s population comes a week after census data showed that Newark, New Jersey&rsquo;s biggest city, reversed decades of population declines, as a surge in Hispanic people drove the first gain in 60 years.</p>
<p>An influx of Hispanic residents also bolstered Baltimore&rsquo;s population. While the number of black residents fell 5.8 percent to 392,938 and whites declined 13.6 percent to 174,120, the Hispanic population more than doubled to 25,960.</p>
<p>After the census report showed the slowing decline, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake issued a statement citing a 13 percent drop in fatal shootings last year as well as a two straight years of increased enrollment in the city&rsquo;s public schools, the first back-to-back increase in decades.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Housing Crisis</b></p>
<p>The foreclosure crisis has also taken its toll. In 2008, Baltimore unsuccessfully sued Wells Fargo &amp; Co., saying the bank targeted black neighborhoods with deceptive loans. Between 2000 and early 2008, more than 33,000 Baltimore homes had been foreclosed upon, which crimped real-estate tax revenue, the city said in its suit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Vacancy Rates</b></p>
<p>Baltimore&rsquo;s vacancy rate for housing was 15.8 percent in 2010, up from 14.1 percent a decade ago, according to the census. Baltimore&rsquo;s was the highest of any major city in Maryland, which had a statewide rate of 9.3 percent, according to the census.</p>

						<p>
							<i>Max Brantley, Arkansas Times (Little Rock), February 11, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Democrat-Gazette further mined Census data yesterday for the finding that white people are no longer a majority of Little Rock&rsquo;s population. They constitute about 48.9 percent of the city&rsquo;s some 193,000 residents; blacks account for 42.3 percent. The rest are some racial mix. Presumably many are Latino, though that is not a racial category for Census purposes. More than 13,000 people, or 6.8 percent of the city&rsquo;s population, said they were of Hispanic or Latino origin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of politics to be mined from this, naturally, beginning with a city board that is roughly 33 percent black (three of 10, plus the white mayor.) Ward-only elections would likely change that balance somewhat, a key reason why downtown power brokers have long favored keeping the decisive handful of board seats elected in expensive citywide races, not by wards. </p>

Read the current academic books coming out about White Flight.  They blame Whites&rsquo; &#8220;abandoning the public space&#8221; for the disastrous chaos in black communities, formerly White, decent, and safe communities.</p>
<p>Now, we are told we &#8220;must recognize&#8221; our responsibilities for the failures of blacks to keep their acquired territory in livable shape.</p>
<p>Whites were supposed to stick around and be robed, raped, and murdered so they wouldn&rsquo;t value their White privilege so much.  Miserable Whites can&rsquo;t enjoy White privilege, so making White as miserable as possible is the way blacks are helping to reshape, transform, change, and improve American Democracy.</p>
<p>An remember always, if your White daughter is raped, her black attackers won&rsquo;t go to prison.  White skin is an admission of White privilege and racism, therefore, Whiteness is &#8220;consent&#8221; to forced sex.  Once a White girl is raped by the blacks, she no longer can claim the privilege of having Whites Only sex- she&rsquo;s been inclusive of diversity, and she didn&rsquo;t need to say &#8220;yes&#8221;.  Her Whiteness is all the &#8220;yes&#8221; the afrovoodoos need.  Affirmative Action sex is eyeing up your daughter right now.</p>
<p><br>
Also, if you are a White conservative, you are a White flight racist:</p>

<p>During the civil rights era, Atlanta thought of itself as &#8220;The City Too Busy to Hate,&#8221; a rare place in the South where the races lived and thrived together. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, however, so many whites fled the city for the suburbs that Atlanta earned a new nickname: &#8220;The City Too Busy Moving to Hate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this reappraisal of racial politics in modern America, Kevin Kruse explains the causes and consequences of &#8220;white flight&#8221; in Atlanta and elsewhere. Seeking to understand segregationists on their own terms, White Flight moves past simple stereotypes to explore the meaning of white resistance. In the end, Kruse finds that segregationist resistance, which failed to stop the civil rights movement, nevertheless managed to preserve the world of segregation and even perfect it in subtler and stronger forms.</p>
<p>Challenging the conventional wisdom that white flight meant nothing more than a literal movement of whites to the suburbs, this book argues that it represented a more important transformation in the political ideology of those involved. In a provocative revision of postwar American history, Kruse demonstrates that traditional elements of modern conservatism, such as hostility to the federal government and faith in free enterprise, underwent important transformations during the postwar struggle over segregation. Likewise, white resistance gave birth to several new conservative causes, like the tax revolt, tuition vouchers, and privatization of public services. Tracing the journey of southern conservatives from white supremacy to white suburbia, Kruse locates the origins of modern American politics.</p>

		<p>I was born in Baltimore and still live in an &#8220;inner-ring&#8221; suburb. NO WAY would I ever go into town if I didn&rsquo;t have to. I occasionally think about the treasures at the Walters Art Museum  &mdash;  what happens to that when the &#8220;locals&#8221; get mad? Same thing that happened in Egypt?  When I was little, Baltimore was relatively safe  &mdash;  rode the Number 8 to Hutzler&rsquo;s downtown. Wanted a fancy-pants house in Resevoir Hill. Now, I just want way far out, because I see the Baltimore population crawling up the arteries  &mdash;  York Road, Loch Raven, etc. </p>
<p>The reason we have fewer non-fatal shootings  &mdash;  think about it, folks  &mdash;  our docs at Johns Hopkins and U of M Shock-Trauma are the BEST in the world. (Kiss that goodbye with Obamacare.)</p>

<p>If the only problem is population decline then an influx of rapidly breeding Hispanics will cure that.  But if the problem is that each resident is costing the government more on average than he pays in then I doubt that flooding one&rsquo;s city with illegal aliens and their spawn will solve anything over the long run.<br>

		<p>The damage is done.  You can only sluff off so much before the residents become too poor and too ethnic to move out to anywhere better.  And there may actually be some &#8216;recumulativeness&rsquo; as whites flee ever further into the exurbs where the cost of living is quite high.</p>
<p>Blacks lump together.  Hispanics lump together.  The sum of which is not synergism but entropy and, ultimately, violence.  It is just a matter of waiting until the critical mass of either or both together drives the city (as Maryland) further against itself inter or intra racially.</p>
<p>Enrollment in schools means nothing.  It&rsquo;s mandatory and the food is often free.  Social entitlement, as institutionalized day care, is not something whites should be &#8216;proud to pay&rsquo; for other races.</p>
<p>And this is the same state as the seat of our Nation&rsquo;s Capital, &#8216;just down the 95&rsquo;.  Pathetic.</p>

		<p>Kick back in a lawn chair with a beer.  Pretend you are about to watch fireworks, but you will see this city fall like a lead meteor once the last of the tax-paying whites leave.  And after the grand finally, with all said and done, your eyes open and a look of awe comes over your face.  You stand up to see some letters on the tallest building in the city announcing it&rsquo;s new city name, &#8220;Detroit II&#8221;.  Your new motto: &#8220;We&rsquo;ll try to do better than last time.&#8221;.  But deep down, we know you won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Wire&#8221; gives a fair depiction of life in &#8220;B-More,&#8221; never mind the justification the show gives for violent street crime by blacks.  In the real Baltimore, blacks commit crimes, it would seem, out of boredom, rather than some great moral justification which &#8220;whitey just don&rsquo;t understand.&#8221;</p>

		<p>city by city our nation will fall to low iq violent rapist blacks and browns who only know &#8220;gimme gimme gimme&#8221;</p>
<p>our federal income tax will make it impossible to hide and whites will pay ever greater taxes year after year.</p>
<p>Social security should be awash with cash with the booming population but the truth is blacks and hispanics take not contribute to social security. Worse they use it as their welfare program with fake disability claims for being &#8220;lispers&#8221; or &#8220;learning disabled&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course blacks are learning disabled! </p>
<p>This will end badly. The only hope is for a state to nullify federal income tax AND vow that any federal agents attempting to arrest citizens will themselves be thrown in jail.</p>

		<p>#4 - you nailed it, re:</p>
<p>&#8220;Baltimore&rsquo;s population fell by 30,193 residents to 620,961 in the past decade, the smallest 10-year decrease since the 1950s, census data show. The 4.6 percent drop followed a 12 percent slide in the 1990s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 9/11, the DC-Baltimore metropolitan area has seen an influx of no fewer than one million government employees.  These jobs have been added to every area of the DC-Baltimore corridor.  Many NSA jobs are located just a few minutes south of downtown Baltimore along the Baltimore Washington Parkway (295).  There are many agencies that have quadrupled in size over what they were in the 1990s, along with new agencies like Homeland Security that didn&rsquo;t exist prior to 9/11.  It is a realtively short commute to the DC beltway (495) from Baltimore.  These new Federal Gov&rsquo;t jobs since 9/11, all feeding at the public trough of course, more than account for any reversal of fortunes as may regard Baltimore city&rsquo;s population growth.  In fact, they most likely mask a further steep decline in private sector employed white residents.</p>
<p>For four years from 1990 to 1994, I lived in a suburb just south of Baltimore.  The violent crime at that time was atrocious.  Having grown up in the Boston area, I was well familiar with blacks and had gone to school at Northeastern University which is adjacent to Roxbury (since the 1960s, Boston&rsquo;s predominatly &#8220;black section&#8221; [read ghetto]).  I was, however, woefully unprepared for the strain or urban blacks whom I would occasionally encounter close up in my suburban Baltimore community.  When sitting, e.g. in a Wendy&rsquo;s for a bite to eat, a car load would pile in and eat at a table within earshot.  I was amazed at their language.  I don&rsquo;t mean only the profanity so much as the actual language itself.  Some form of ebonics that was so foreign that I literally could not understand what they were saying.  I am now a white-flight statistic, and I&rsquo;ve escaped the Baltimore suburbs for the Sun Belt garden city of the south.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the DC/Baltimore corridor has become one of the more unpleasant places in all of America to live.  I compare it to a Blivey.  For those who may not know what a Blivey is, it&rsquo;s two pounds of $#@& in a one pound bag.  Common courtesy is anything but common.  For those feeding on the public trough, they&rsquo;re stuck with their neighbors because that&rsquo;s where their jobs are.  The option of leaving would require finding comparable salary and benefits in the private sector.</p>
<p>After having moved south, I hadn&rsquo;t been back to Baltimore for a look around last week on business.  I took a little stroll, as it were, down memory lane and was shocked at the ugliness that had grown up around my former residential area.  Just as Washington DC became a mecca for blacks to camp out post slavery in order to have ready access to government sponsored largesse, so now the entire DC/Baltimore area has added a new level of folks flocking there to work for Uncle Sam.  You can almost hear, as Ross Perot used to say, the massive sucking sound of the American taxpayer dollars being siphoned away, plus an additional 40 cents on every dollar placed on our grand kids credit account.  I stayed in Greenbelt, where I-95 connects to the Washington D.C. beltway.  The first evening I went to the closest Outback Steakhouse restaurant for dinner.  It was 98% black.  All of the help, greeters, everybody including almost all of the customers were black.  The music that they were playing had a distinctly soulful flavour.  I&rsquo;ve never been so surprised to find myself in that great of a minority, especially at an Outback. </p>

		<p>A number of neighborhoods have been gentrified by young professionals. Nevertheless, white flight can only be reversed significantly by more vigorous efforts to imprison the criminals who caused it initially. </p>
