<h1><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,747459,00.html">Italy Warns of a New Wave of Immigrants to Europe</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Spiegel, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Moammar Gadhafi, in recent years, has enjoyed a cynical role as Europe&rsquo;s border guard against African immigrants. Italian ministers now warn that if his Libyan government collapses, people will flow across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Chaos in Libya has led to immediate concern that hundreds of thousands of immigrants could head for Europe. Italy&rsquo;s interior minister, ahead of an EU summit in Brussels, called on Thursday for European help in dealing with a looming &#8220;catastrophic humanitarian emergency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other Italian officials warned earlier this week of a wave of refugees fleeing violence that Moammar Gadhafi&rsquo;s regime has reportedly visited on its own people. But if Libya collapses into anarchy, some observers have said, it could become an immigration route for far more people from sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p><b>A &#8216;Biblical Exodus&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>&#8220;We know what to expect when the Libyan national system falls,&#8221; said Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Wednesday, according to the UK Telegraph. &#8220;A wave of 200,000 to 300,000 immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are estimates, and on the low side,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It is a Biblical exodus. It&rsquo;s a problem that no Italian should underestimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over 5,000 migrants have already sailed from Tunisia to the Italian island of Lampedusa since the Tunisian government fell in January. But post-uprising conditions in Tunisia are mild compared to reports this week from Libya, where Gadhafi&rsquo;s security forces have fired on protesters as well as on guest workers who have now started to flee across the borders into Egypt and Tunisia. </p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re shooting at civilians and children,&#8221; a shocked Egyptian at Libya&rsquo;s eastern border told SPIEGEL ONLINE on Wednesday.</p>
<p><b>Gadhafi, Guarding the Gates </b></p>
<p>Gadhafi in recent years has played up his role as a bulwark against African immigrants to Europe. Italy and Libya began joint naval patrols in 2008 to stop boatloads of illegal or trafficked immigrants from crossing the Mediterranean, and last year Libya signed a €50 billion deal with the European Union to manage its borders as a &#8220;transit country&#8221; for sub-Saharan Africans.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Frattini said that some 2.5 million people in Libya  &mdash;  about a third of the population  &mdash;  are non-Libyan immigrants who would flee if the government fell. </p>
<p>Gadhafi himself has enjoyed stoking these fears. &#8220;Europe will become black,&#8221; he said last December, if European leaders failed to cooperate with him on immigration controls.</p>
<p><b>Welcome to Germany?</b></p>
<p>Amnesty International is calling on other countries to ease the burden on Italy if institutions there are overwhelmed. &#8220;Germany, as the largest and most economically powerful country in Europe, has a special responsibility to act,&#8221; said Monika Lüke, head of Amnesty International in Germany. &#8220;Germany has to finally end its obstructionist attitude regarding a common refugee policy in the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically the head of Italy&rsquo;s anti-immigrant Northern League party, Umberto Bossi, made similar statements. &#8220;If they come, we will just send them to France and Germany,&#8221; he said according to the Telegraph. </p>
<p>But German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière, on his way to the EU summit in Brussels, which begins on Thursday, warned Thursday morning that rumors of a refugee crisis could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Europe, he told the German broadcaster ZDF, should try to promote stability in North Africa. &#8220;People stay in countries with stable democracies,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The two-day meeting in Brussels is a routine summit for EU interior and justice ministers, but the crisis in Libya will force immigration to the top of the agenda.<br>

		<p>While most of the world smiles upon the shows of power of the people through much of the Middle East/North Africa, and have rosy visions of these countries&rsquo; future now that the oppressive regimes are toppling, most people here probably have a much more realistic prediction of these countries&rsquo; future: after the instability, some new leadership will arise, it will be more of the same, with only very minor improvements to be had.  Following this, hordes of frustrated refugees, possibly by the millions as this article states, will flood the West.</p>

		<p>Europe is the home of NATO, the most powerful military alliance in the history of mankind.  </p>
<p>If it were the Republican Guard legions of the former Saddam Hussein regime sailing toward Europe, you can bet the response would be swift and decisive. </p>
<p>The protection of European territory from invasion is a military responsibility; Europe is being invaded. The response should not be in the hands of corrupt civilian rulers. </p>

		<p>I agree with Bossi and hope Italy turns away all immigrants from Africa. These immigrants have proven over and over again that they have nothing to contribute to first world western European nations (except maybe to their athletic teams). It is well known that anti-immigration sentiment in Italy is at an all time high and I hope the people of Europe don&rsquo;t feel guilted into entering this unholy marriage with African immigrants (of both Arabic and black ancestry) who, quite frankly, have a history of butchering each other. They will only bring their poverty, misery, chaos, and violence to any civilized nation they enter. Europe!! I am begging you! WAKE UP!!</p>

		<p>The Camp of the Saints &#8220;prophecy&#8221; is about to come true.  But I feel the ending will be different in real life than that of the book.  If several hundred thousand or more likely one million plus sail across the Mediterranean Sea it will cause regional wars or full blown civil wars in entire countries.</p>
<p>People that say or think whites will just lay down and take are dead wrong.  I am not implying that all whites are racially aware, but they all will defend their own towns or families, even nutjob liberals.  Whites will lose if the military intervenes and shoots those that oppose this exodus.  I would consider it an invasion, though.</p>

<p>Well, so what? All the Italians have to do is not let them in.  Simple, isn&rsquo;t it?  Sure, the Pope will burble and moan about &#8220;welcoming the stranger,&#8221; but he&rsquo;s made himself irrelevant even in Italy.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Amnesty International is calling on other countries to ease the burden on Italy if institutions there are overwhelmed.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>See above. Italy won&rsquo;t have a &#8220;burden&#8221; unless it chooses to.  Oh, and by the way, has Amnesty International bothered to ask the Italian people what <i>they</i> want?</p>
<p> &ldquo;Germany, as the largest and most economically powerful country in Europe, has a special responsibility to act,&rdquo; said Monika Lüke, head of Amnesty International in Germany. &ldquo;Germany has to finally end its obstructionist attitude regarding a common refugee policy in the EU.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translation: &#8220;Germany is an evil White racist country, and must atone for its Nazi past by absorbing each and every boatload of nonWhites that care to scuttle across its irrelevant borders.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The two-day meeting in Brussels is a routine summit for EU interior and justice ministers, but the crisis in Libya will force immigration to the top of the agenda.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The European (Soviet) Union is functioning exactly as planned.  Europeans, you wanted your New World Order.  Now how do you like it?<br>

		<p>Libya is already the departure point for most illegal aliens who sail to Italy. If Lybia become a violent, unstable no-go zone, it can only help Italy. Before his fall/recent turmoil Ghadaffi was pretty much a light skinned black nationalist pontificating about turning Europe black by exporting millions of Africans&hellip; After failing to win over Arabs, he has apparently thrown his lot in with black africans and utilized them to murder his own people&hellip;</p>
<p>The best possible thing for Europe, in my opinion would be a total failure of North African governments followed by recolonization by Europe. I am against colonization but if European governments controlled North Africa it would be much easier to mass deport the Muslim invading hordes. </p>

<p>My interpretation is that Bossi is letting the rest of Europe know that this isn&rsquo;t just Italy&rsquo;s problem. And if the rest of Europe doesn&rsquo;t back them up in stopping it they will make it the rest of Europe&rsquo;s problem. I support Bossi in this. It&rsquo;s high time socialist bureaucrats stop criticizing and blocking others&rsquo; attempts to address the illegal immigration disaster. If Italy is to hold the line then they deserve support.</p>

<p>WWII clearly didn&rsquo;t teach the Italians or Germans anything, you either stop invaders on the beach OR you don&rsquo;t stop them at all! Germans and Italians apparently need to buy prayer rugs and learn Arabic&hellip;.we Americans already are!!:( OH! and BTW Mr. Bossi, you won&rsquo;t &#8220;send&#8221; muslims anywhere, they will go where the hell they please and you can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>

		<p>Canada, Australia and Egypt have one thing in common: they look huge on the map but have only a small portion of their land that is habitable by humans. Accordingly, Canada&rsquo;s population is only 30 million and Australia&rsquo;s population is only 22 million people. However, Egypt&rsquo;s population is a whopping 80 million people, more than Canada and Australia combined! How can the Egyptian government or the private sector create so many jobs to feed so many people? This issue is not being addressed.</p>

		<p>It is not just Italy but the entire EU as is bordering the Mediterranean. And the exodus will be not just from Libya but all of North Africa. And from areas much further south too. In the millions and make the border between the U.S. and Mex seem sound and tranquil.</p>
<p>We could see a major break up and total destruction of the normal way of life and societal stability for that Mediterranean region. WE ARE RIGHT NOW?</p>

		<p>While some African immigrants do choose to go to USA or Canada or Europe or Australia, more than half the African immigrants choose to live in other parts of Africa because it is closer meaning they can be closer to their relatives and there are less cultural conflicts and requires less expense to immigrate if they choose to live in other parts of Africa.  </p>

		<p> A note to &#8220;Senaca the younger&#8221;: White people may stand and fight the invaders but the biggest problem is that the established government is on the side of the invaders.<br>
 The government leaders have so much time, energy and effort tied up in keeping the nations &#8220;elites&#8221; happy that they will gladly order government troops to fire on their own citizens to help the invaders because they are nothing more than puppets doing the elites bidding.</p>

		<p>Perhaps again we need to look at the big picture, Planet Earth is quite simply overpopulated. Anyone that can, will by any means possible try and get away from their overpopulated war- torn hell-holes and their corrupt incompetent governments to find the land of milk and honey in the west.</p>
<p>Are any of the worlds leaders addressing this issue? (Overpopulation) Are any of the world do-gooders such as Amnesty International or the UN refugee agency addressing the issue, no way! Islam seems to prescribe that their families should have 10 children. Only China has made some attempt to limit population growth.</p>
<p>The solution for everyone else,Just send them all to the West. Yes, the west could just could possibly absorb up to a billion more before our way of life including our economies and social infrastructures would just completely collapse.In the mean time the population of the 3rd world despite all of it&rsquo;s misery and wars would probably have increased by a further 2 billion.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of a time back in the 70s when some otherwise sensible people would buy 25 acres of land and try and be self sufficient just in case our way of life collapsed due to the oil crises at the time. I told one family I knew that even if they were successful living off their land, the mob would come and raid them anyway if anarchy took over in our cities.</p>
<p>Another commenter has observed that while Australia is a big land that only a small part is habitable, this is totally correct! (Our larger cities already rely on desalinated sea water just to keep going.)</p>

<p>Remember when progressives used to promote ZPG (zero population growth)? Seems ZPG works only to cut down the numbers of people in the advanced nations. Meanwhile, the third world populaces multiply (in part due to Western food and medical aid) and then mass migrate into Europe and North America. We are facing a &#8220;movement of peoples&#8221; not seen since the days of the Fall of Rome. </p>

Oz, I read a news opinion once that blew me away. It said the China`s one child policy is NOT about limiting population growth, but it is about destroying the last obstacle to total domination, the nuclear family. One billion people where there are NO brothers and sisters or cousins. Only the parents and the state. They have bred out the genetic &#8220;Bonanza response&#8221; ( an American Western show where three brothers ride to the rescue of each other every week). There is no more family loyalty to supersede the state because there are NO MORE FAMILIES!!!</p>
