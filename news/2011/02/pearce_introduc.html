<h1><a href="https://www.sonorannews.com/archives/2011/110223/frontpage-Pearce.html">Pearce Introduces Immigration Omnibus &#8216;Clean-Up&rsquo; Bill</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Bentley, Sonoran News (Cave Creek, Arizona), February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Russell Pearce, R-Mesa, introduced SB1611, an immigration omnibus bill, which he says is basically a &#8220;clean-up&#8221; bill to Proposition 200, passed by voters in 2004, and various subsequent voter-approved statutes requiring people to demonstrate they are legally present in order to obtain public benefits. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>SB 1611 would require persons to provide documentation for all public benefits, even those which cannot be denied under federal law.</p>
<p>The bill requires the attorney general to provide employers that cannot provide proof they are registered in the E-Verify program with a notice of noncompliance. </p>
<p>If the employer is still not in compliance six months after the notice is issued, SB 1611 requires the AG to order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses held by that employer.</p>
<p>All licenses suspended under this subsection would remain suspended until the employer complies.</p>
<p>Public housing authorities, including cities, towns and counties, would be prohibited from offering public housing to any person who cannot provide verification of U.S. citizenship or documented verification of qualified alien status.</p>
<p>SB 1611 further requires public housing authorities to evict all residents of a dwelling unit in rental housing accommodations owned, operated, managed or contracted for by the public housing authority if a resident of that unit allows a person who is in the country illegally to reside in that unit.</p>
<p>Schools are currently required to notify a person enrolling a pupil for the first time that within 30 days that person must provide a certified copy of the pupil&rsquo;s birth certificate or other reliable proof of the pupil&rsquo;s identity and age, such as the pupil&rsquo;s baptismal certificate, application for a social security number, or original school registration records, accompanied by an affidavit explaining inability to provide a copy of the birth certificate. The same documentation must be provided to the county school superintendent if the child is to be home-schooled.</p>
<p>If the person either enrolling or home schooling the student does not comply with that requirement or the affidavit appears inaccurate or suspicious in form and content, the school, school district or superintendent must refer the case to the local law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>SB 1611 increases the penalty from a class 2 to a class 1 misdemeanor for employees of state agencies or political subdivisions that administer federal public benefits, any person who administers or processes any state or local public benefit and supervisors who were aware of an employee&rsquo;s failure to report discovered violations of federal immigration law and failed to direct the employee to make the report.</p>
<p>The bill identifies commercial or professional licenses, benefits provided by the public retirement systems and plans of this state, and services widely available to the general population as a whole, as state or local public benefit.</p>
<p>While SB 1611 makes it unlawful for a person unlawfully present to operate a motor vehicle, if convicted, it requires the court to order the motor vehicle operated by that person at the time of the offense forfeited, sentence the person to serve at least 30 consecutive days in jail and order the person to pay incarceration costs.</p>
<p>Property subject to forfeiture would be disposed of in accordance with current law but would require the proceeds to be deposited into the General Fund.</p>
<p>Motor vehicle registration applications must include proof satisfactory to ADOT that the applicant&rsquo;s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law, with several exceptions, including 90-day non-registration permits and single trip permits.</p>
<p>There are several other motor vehicle provisions in the bill, one of which specifies that a driver license issued in Arizona on or after October 1, 1996 is evidence that the applicant&rsquo;s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.</p>
<p>The bill prohibits colleges and universities from admitting any student who does not demonstrate lawful presence in this country.</p>
<p>Unconvinced out-of-state tuition covers the full cost of education, Pearce says it&rsquo;s pointless to allow illegal aliens to attend college when they cannot legally obtain jobs once they graduate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This change would add voter registration fraud and illegal voting, class 5 and class 6 felonies, respectively, to the roster of non-bondable offenses for illegal aliens.</p>
<p>{snip} SB 1611 would require the court to order as an initial term of probation that the person convicted of aggravated taking the identity of another person to be imprisoned in the county jail for not less than 180 consecutive days to commence on the date of sentencing. </p>
<p>The bill amends A.R.S. Title 41, State Government, by adding Chapter 48, which states, &#8220;This state or any political subdivision of this state shall not accept a consular identification card that is issued by a foreign government as a valid form of identification.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, SB 1611 amends A.R.S. 41-1822, powers and duties of the Police Officer Training and Certification Board, by adding Paragraph E, which states, &#8220;The board shall revoke the certification of any officer who refuses to uphold the United States and Arizona constitutions and enforce the laws of this state.&#8221;<br>

		<p>A passing fad.  </p>
<p>All these revolts against the illegals will eventually be overturned by illegals&rsquo; voting with the permission and encouragement of federal non white employees.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be tempted to say that Arizona&rsquo;s resistance will be an interesting sidebar in a history book, but by the time it&rsquo;s history, there won&rsquo;t be books in third world non white Amerika.</p>
<p>The Diversity says that Whites have no legitimate interest in defending themselves from non white immigration, documented or not.</p>
<p>The Diversity is winning.</p>

		<p>why is SB1611 an issue? Illegals should not be here period! Let alone, suck the taxpayers dry. I&rsquo;m not going to give the government my hard earned and much needed money so they can give it to illegals. These monies are to help the citizens of this once great country, not some parasites who violate our laws.</p>

Then you had better form white super majority states, pronto.  So that peoples who have an interest in learning from history books have states to live in.  Do it privately through the &#8216;job search&rsquo; business-is-business provisos of corporations whose requirements are so specific that -only- one person as  much as type of employee can be right for the job.  That&rsquo;s right, we will have to be as picky about the whites we take in as we are exclusive of hispanics and blacks once we opt out.</p>
<p>Of the Union.</p>
<p>@2<br>
You hit the nail on the head.  The one way to bring this thing to a boil _fast_ is to make it a function of revenues from states which are willing to share the burden of lost federal matching funds through a new standup currency system as the only means available to avoid the coming crash of the USD.</p>
<p>If we have the equivalent of just 5-7 big mid-states supporting each other, adopt extremely conservative fiscal policies and use innovative methods like tolls and green-up taxes to force civilian micro windfarms and home-grown foods, we can get out from under The Fed.  Who are now and always have been our real enemies.</p>
<p>Past which, it may come to war but it will be a war we can win because if we lose, militarily, we can still shut out the corporate interests who feed from this glut of immigrants by refusing to buy into their mass consumerism.  We just need the _smallest_ of windows here and any followon oppression (can&rsquo;t grow your own food) will seem so arbitrary and commercial-interest punitive that we can make a moral case to Allies who listen to our &#8216;taxation without representation&rsquo; grievances.</p>
<p>But money and the refusal to buy into a system that doesn&rsquo;t benefit us anymore is _the key_.  Provided we can sit on enough high tech expertise to make other states groan at the losses when we stand up independent industries and government.</p>

		<p>Three cheers for Arizona and especially for the Senate President in never giving up on stopping the illegal invasion. States like Arizona and California are going broke giving illegals all kinds of &#8220;benefits&#8221;.  It way past time to shut these magnets down.  We all know the states will never get any help from Obama or Janet Napolitano.   Also think Governor Jan Brewer is great!</p>

		<p>better fight back hard now.  it is getting very close to the critical point of no return.  past advanced civilizations fell for the same reasons we are presently experiencing:  over taxation, open borders to undesirables, breakdown of family unit, wars, too much people on welfare, high deficits, racial deterioration, etc.</p>

		<p>BRAVO!!! Now if every state would pass and enforce a law like this, there would be much of an illegal immigration problem. Of course I can already hear the cries of racism going out.</p>

		<p>NOTHING will ever be done about illegals in this country except to grant them amnesty. They will NEVER close the border. If anything ALL borders will become obsolete so as to hurry the annihilation of the White race.  We all know it. There is no turning back since the White man/woman gave up their race and their nations to the ever growing populations of the nonwhite races. We all see and hear these &#8220;Whites&#8221; always defending the nonwhites and the Christian &#8220;brethren&#8221; are all on board with the destruction of our race and homelands. You see it is called &#8220;compassion&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8221; not to mention &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; to these foolish, naive Christians&hellip;. BTW, I am a Christian in the TRUE sense of the word.</p>
