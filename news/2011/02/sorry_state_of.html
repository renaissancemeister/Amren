<h1><a href="https://adage.com/article?article_id=148565">Sorry State of Diversity in Advertising Is Also a Culture Problem</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Bush, Advertising Age, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite some positive trends over the past year  &mdash;  general-market agencies are hiring more Hispanics (as they try to win more Hispanic business)  &mdash;  a number of watchdog groups and industry professionals still think the situation is far from good.</p>
<p>Though the most current figures aren&rsquo;t yet available, the New York City Commission on Human Rights doesn&rsquo;t seem to be satisfied with progress made since it intervened in 2006. And while holding companies say they&rsquo;re making progress, the threat of a class-action lawsuit still looms.</p>
<p>Hiring, of course, is only part of the problem. The failure to retain minority talent, which many believe is due to the lack of an encouraging environment, is the other issue.</p>
<p>Carol Watson, president, Tangerine Watson, a cross-cultural talent consultancy, said she hasn&rsquo;t seen dramatic differences in minority hiring over the past year but has noticed one positive trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employee resource groups and affinity groups are a big thing now for general-market agencies that get a lot of multicultural assignments,&#8221; Ms. Watson said. &#8220;There has been more hiring, of Hispanics in particular, for these groups that pitch and consult clients, discuss messaging and help identify all of the opportunities in multicultural marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rob Norman, CEO of WPP&rsquo;s Group M North America, said diversity hiring has occupied more of his time than he thought it would since taking the CEO role one year ago. He said the agency has brought on a full-time diversity recruiter. But he said that all of the programs and efforts may never be enough to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do you have to recruit people that are diverse, you have to create environments under which those people are comfortable working in,&#8221; Mr. Norman said. {snip}</p>
<p>Clifford Mulqueen, deputy commissioner general counsel at the NYC Commission on Human Rights, said the commission will soon be releasing a report on its investigation into the diversity hiring practices of 15 ad agencies including Arnold, Euro RSCG, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Grey Direct and Grey Interactive, Y&R;, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Kaplan, DraftFCB, Gotham, BBDO, DDB, Merkley and Partners and PHD.</p>
<p>After finding fault with the diversity-hiring practices at many of the big ad agencies in New York, in 2006 the commission signed a memorandum with them. The sides came to an understanding that the agencies would increase their minority hiring. {snip}<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A court action may not be the way to go,&#8221; Mr. Mulqueen said. &#8220;It seems like they have to do something to change the entire culture.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If this were happening to any other industry, I would, as usual, find this government interference infuriating.  However, considering the Advertising Industry&rsquo;s complicity in trivializing, demoralizing, and demonizing Whites, I can only call this JUST DESERTS.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s also a silver lining to this cloud of Comeuppance. Possibly, with significant &#8216;minority&rsquo; presence gumming up the wheels of Big Advertising&rsquo;s machine, the industry will become less effective at furthering the objectives of the giant multinational corporations which seek to destroy us.</p>
<p>Currently, we&rsquo;re being boxed-in by the traitorous actions of Big Government, Big Business (and its Handmaiden, Advertising), Big Media and Big Religion.  But with &#8216;minorities&rsquo; insinuating themselves into the hierarchies of each, I wonder for how long those monstrous entities will remain as potently threatening as they are today.</p>

		<p>How dare private businesses hire who they want to hire?</p>
<p>Obviously in a free society we must have government quotas ordering us as to who we may or may not hire. Otherwise how will our culture be changed for us?</p>
<p>Our beliefs are obviously wrong, our culture is obviously bad, our thoughts are obviously incorrect. Thank goodness for liberal activists and big government to reprogram our minds.</p>

		<p>Is having a black face, usually as a white womans mate, not enough for these diversibots?  Every commercial I see has some form of diversity in it, mostly in laughably absurd roles such as scientist, doctor and other professional to educate stupid white men on how to be healthy and save for the future.   </p>

		<p>I just saw that men between 50 and 60 have a 38% harder time finding a job, while women in the group have 18%.  And it gets worse as the age increases over 60.  Which is the reason why I have so much time to read and post on Amren.  I&rsquo;m a well educated, reasonably intelligent white male and all I pick up from the society I am in is that I should go away somewhere.  It seems as if the campaign to corral and eliminate white men is working.  I think that black men have all sorts of opportunities, but are continually their own worst enemies.</p>

		<p>It is my observation that TV, print, and Internet ads feature black faces at a rate of at least double their actual share of the population (let alone their share of the non-prison, middle class population that is most likely to buy stuff advertisers want to sell).  Anyone have precise numbers?<br>

<p>The fact of the matter is, no successful company lets a good employee go. Companies always &#8220;retain&#8221; the best people they can. If people aren&rsquo;t retained, they just aren&rsquo;t up to standards. That&rsquo;s how things work.<br>

		<p>Not enough blacks in commercials? Since President Obama&rsquo;s election there has been a massive increase in commercials with blacks in them. Don&rsquo;t they see All State Commercials? Old Spice Commercials? Beer commercials? Every commercial in the Super Bowl?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m the only male at my workplace. Does that mean my human rights have been violated? </p>
<p>The connection between &#8216;human rights&rsquo; and the lack of minorities in advertising is an outrageous leap in logic that flies in the face of all that is intelligent. That they actually have an audience with this nonsense and receive anything more than laughter in the face is really incredible. </p>

		<p>Instead of complaining&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy anything with diverse advertising. Vote with your wallet. If enough people vote this way, Madison Ave. will sit up and pay attention. Better yet, send a letter (not an e-mail) to a company with a good campaign, and one with a bad one. Praise the former and tell the latter that you won&rsquo;t be frequenting their business, and why not.</p>
