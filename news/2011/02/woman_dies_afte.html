<h1><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0209/breaking31.html">Woman Dies After Buttock Injection</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Irish Times, February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A woman who lived in Britain has died after travelling to the US for a cosmetic treatment to her buttocks that was arranged over the internet.</p>
<p>Detectives said Claudia Adusei (20), and three companions travelled from London and were staying at the Hampton Inn in southwest Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Two of them had visited the city in November to have their buttocks enlarged. On Monday, one received another injection while the other had a hip augmentation.</p>
<p>Police said the woman who had the buttock injection later complained of chest pains and had trouble breathing. Paramedics were called, and she was taken to Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital where she died.</p>
<p>Her death has sparked a police investigation.</p>
<p>The results of a postmortem examination by the Delaware County medical examiner&rsquo;s office have not been released.</p>
<p>Detectives are now looking for two people who carried out the cosmetic procedure, which police said was arranged over the internet. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not quite sure right now if that person performing that procedure is licensed or unlicensed,&#8221; said Lieutenant John Walker, of the Philadelphia police. &#8220;We&rsquo;re still working that information right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lt Walker said investigators were also awaiting test results to determine the substance used.</p>
<p>TV channel NBC quoted the Delaware County medical examiner as saying Miss Adusei&rsquo;s preliminary cause of death was silicone injected into her vascular system, which stopped her heart.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: &#8220;We are aware of reports of a UK resident who tragically died in Philadelphia.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Why is it Third World people who tend to hold the monopoly on odd and what I would refer to as &#8220;perverted&#8221; medical procedures?  Just a few months ago there was some other story out about another woman dying of the very same procedure and the &#8220;doctor&#8221; responsible was a hispanic woman. </p>
<p>Then there is the other procedure where women get their buttocks augmented by fat redistribution (as opposed to an injection). The doctors who hold the monopoly on this particular procedure usually have either brown or black skin and sound like they are from Latin America somewhere or the Carribean, from what I have seen on television. </p>
<p>Is this a procedure that those particular cultures are obsessed with?  It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me.</p>

<p>First of all, Adusei is not an Irish name. Second, there is no indication that this woman was from Ireland. The article says that she was a UK resident. Just because the article is from an Irish newspaper does not mean that the woman was Irish herself.</p>

<p>Oh, definitely licensed. All licensed cosmetic surgeons operate out of Hampton Inns.</p>

		<p>Well, obviously, this tragic situation does have its humorous aspects.  I mean, anyone who crosses the Pond for an a**-augmentation has got to have a cut wire or two somewhere, especially when it&rsquo;d be simpler, safer and cheaper to pad one&rsquo;s clothing in the area desired.  I think &#8220;her driveway doesn&rsquo;t line up with her garage&#8221; covers it well.  I also think the folks who attempted such an atrocity need to be caught, prosecuted, and put away for a long time.  It never fails to amaze me how creative people can be in finding methods to kill themselves.</p>

		<p>They did the same thing in postwar Japan with direct injections of silicon to augment breast size in their doll-like female biometrics.  Since silicon, even &#8216;medical&rsquo; silicon, is a highly aggressive long term irritant and carcinogen unless &#8216;safely sealed&rsquo; in a separate, non toxic, (latex or similar) envelope, the death rates were enormous with reactive pustules forming in days.</p>
<p>Yet nobody remembered the lesson learned when we did the same thing to OUR women in the 1970s and 80s, turning them into caricatures whose &#8216;enhanced&rsquo; proportions were and remain _ugly_, even now that firm silicon has been replaced with water balloon saline (also toxic if it leaks btw. and they -always- do, eventually).</p>
<p>The ultimate irony being that whites head to brown countries to have these procedures done &#8216;cheaply&rsquo; with idiots traveling to Mexico or even as far as India to go under the knife and have their bodies be mauled and distorted, for a price that is less than what would be only criminal if done in a backroom, here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t miss the people who pay 5,000 dollars to hop on an airplane and head off to the biological equivalent of a chop shop in Calcutta or Mexico City.</p>

Yes, although black women often accuse white women of getting butt implants in droves, the truth is more often it is non-white women, and especially black who opt for the procedure, since ample round rumps figures highly in black culture, in terms of desirability. I actually know more white women who want to hop on the treadmill as soon as their butts start to look too big, regardless of how much big butts are emphasized in today&rsquo;s culture.</p>
