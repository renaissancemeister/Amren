			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Molly K. Hooper, The Hill, February 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A conservative lawmaker has made friends with liberal colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), but others are skeptical of him.</p>
<p>Some in the caucus have embraced freshman Rep. Allen West (Fla.), who is the first Republican to join the CBC since 1996.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, some are &#8220;leery&#8221; of West, according to a CBC member who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>West raised some eyebrows in a CBC meeting soon after the assassination attempt of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.).</p>
<p>After members expressed concern for their safety, West, a two-decade plus Army veteran, said members should consider carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Hill this week, West said, &#8220;They were talking about getting detailed security and I said, &#8216;Well you just look in your state as far as getting a concealed weapons licensing,&rsquo; which is something that I have. I think personal protection starts with yourself, but you just coordinate with local law enforcement to make sure you have collateral security at your events.&#8221;</p>
<p>CBC member Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) said West&rsquo;s suggestion didn&rsquo;t go over well, adding it was &#8220;frowned&#8221; on by other lawmakers.</p>
<p>Legislators in the CBC seem sensitive to reports highlighting controversial remarks attributed to West, including one recent statement that appeared to single out fellow CBC member Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) for his Muslim beliefs.</p>
<p>West argued that his initial comment that Ellison&rsquo;s beliefs &#8220;represent the antithesis of the principles upon which this country was established&#8221; were misconstrued. He said the comments were &#8220;not about his Islamic faith, but about his continued support of [the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)].&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>CBC Chairman Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) said West has been &#8220;no different than any other member.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s not alien to Democrats. He is a former military leader who probably speaks in a different tone than a majority of the CBC members on issues of the war and those old social issues that divide Democrats and Republicans,&#8221; Cleaver said.</p>
<p>Freshman Rep. Tim Scott (S.C.), a black Republican, has not opted to join the CBC.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Lewis [Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.)] told The Hill that his colleagues &#8220;see [West] as another member.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewis said CBC members do not feel awkward in West&rsquo;s presence  &mdash;  even though several members, including Lewis, campaigned against West during the 2010 election.</p>
<p>&#8220;CBC is very diverse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.nbsp; [West] will fit in. He&rsquo;ll be ok,&#8221; Lewis added.</p>

		<p>John Lewis is a constant embarrassment.  We hope he keeps talking.  Shows liberal Whites just how low they must sink to find blacks who are &#8220;distinguished, esteemed, renowned civil rights icons whose legacy enriches us all and makes Atlanta a better place.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Lewis should be held accountable for all the violent blacks in his district who make our lives miserable and constantly threatened.  Upon the chaos to come, so might accountability if White Humanity will ever rally around the White Christ who says it&rsquo;s okay to prevent your enemies from killing you.<br>

		<p>Allen West and Steve Cohen might not be good for much, but at the very least, they&rsquo;ve inadvertently exposed the CBC for the lying two-faced hypocrites that they and most of their members are.  Lazy Clay (D-MO) is part of the CBC&rsquo;s core mentality, and he fought tooth and nail Cohen&rsquo;s admission.  Just a few days ago, AR had the story about him bashing one of Ron Paul&rsquo;s witnesses.</p>

<p>Remember that diversity means fewer whites.  Maximum diversity is achieved when there are no whites at all.  So yes, the CBC is very diverse.</p>

<p>As in the color ranges from chocolate brown with African hair to so black they are purple with African hair. Mr. West may indeed be different and I consider his comments about the muslims to be dead on. It is TBD if he becomes just another black thinking only of his race and his position in politics or a true innovator. I hope the latter.</p>

		<p>His comment &#8220;I think personal protection starts with yourself&#8221; shows a man who thinks that a man needs to be responsible for himself. The other members &#8220;frowned&#8221; on his comments, just shows the typical black attitude to put responsibility for themselves on others and blame the government and whites if they are not taken care of. Of course this also means buying and carrying a gun in a legal manner which is rare for blacks. I applaud Allen West!</p>
