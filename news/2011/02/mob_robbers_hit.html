<h1>Mob Robbers Hit Convenience Stores in St. Paul</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Trisha Volpe, KARE-TV (Minneapolis-St. Paul), February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Saturday, St. Paul police say 50 kids swarmed a Holiday store on Wabasha, a so-called mob theft or mob robbery. They stormed in together, their numbers overwhelming and just started stealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They steal your basic convenience store type of goods and run out,&#8221; says St. Paul Police Department spokesperson Andy Skoogman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second incident like it in St. Paul in less than six months. Last fall, surveillance cameras at a BP station on Lexington captured some 20 kids coming into the store at the same time. They stole merchandise and one of them assaulted the clerk on the way out.</p>
<p>Police worry about this kind of mob behavior because there have been similar incidents in other cities.</p>

		<p>and why is this such a common occurence? blacks and hispanics know they are above the law. That laws are only for White people and law abiding citizens. Will all you bleeding hearts stand aside and let White people punish those who violate White&rsquo;s! Until we punish criminals properly(punishment to fit the crime)this will keep getting worse,mainly,of course, in area&rsquo;s predominately non-White.</p>

		<p>This is where American Renaissance is at its most useful and vital.  Mass black crimes of this nature are almost always stifled at the national level, so collecting these local reports allows the nation as a whole to have a better idea of black violence and crime.</p>
<p>Also of note is the website hosting the original story.  57 comments were added, approximately a third of which were removed for &#8220;violations of terms of service&#8221;, showing that Americans are indeed waking up and being more blunt about what&rsquo;s going on.  Some eye-opening posts were allowed to stay, including one rightfully complaining about the massive taxpayer-funded importation of Somalis into Minnesota at a time when there are so many other blacks obviously not being properly raised.<br>

		<p>The typical retail store design cannot work with an African population. They cannot control their urge to steal, and theft eventually shuts every store down.</p>
<p>When the Africans have ruined and therefore caused the closing of every food store they will whine idiotically about being victims of &#8220;food deserts.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The most (police attitude) informative material at the end of the article is unfortunately left out-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Police worry about this kind of mob behavior because there have been similar incidents in other cities. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is never highlighted in the publically available media so the LEOs know the level of risk but we don&rsquo;t, until it&rsquo;s too late to do the logical thing which is hire guards and install a limited cage-entry gate like most pawn shops now have.</p>
<p>We need a local PD Wikileaks volunteer here, they are all networked and the shock of the scale of black crimes should be made fully public.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
As for the incident at the Wabasha Holiday, investigators say surveillance images will help them identify mob members.  They cited at least 20 of them for curfew violations that night, but more serious charges are possible with the kind of mob mentality police say could get even more dangerous for both workers and customers. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Yeah, if you can find them again.  Which is like an excuse to FORCE biometric IDs on us to &#8216;make us all safer&rsquo;.  Never mind that this should have been a bang-and-you&rsquo;re-done type of automatic adult crime (as adult organizational skills in evidence) that gets these little monsters on the fast track to a permanent residency in a Federal penitentiary.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&#8220;The inclination might be to try to stop it. We don&rsquo;t want people to do that. We want store employees to be witnesses to shoplifting, not victims of assault,&#8221; says Skoogman. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Do you even know what your own statute says?</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
609.24 SIMPLE ROBBERY.<br>
Whoever, having knowledge of not being entitled thereto, takes personal property from the person or in the presence of another and uses or threatens the imminent use of force against any person to overcome the person&rsquo;s resistance or powers of resistance to, or to compel acquiescence in, the taking or carrying away of the property is guilty of robbery and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than ten years or to payment of a fine of not more than $20,000, or both.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.24&amp;year=2010" rel="nofollow">https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.24&year;=2010</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a decade or 20 grand for &#8216;simple&rsquo; robbery.</p>
<p>These people attacked a clerk who _did nothing_ just to intimidate them.  You multiply the &#8216;threat of force&rsquo; by 50 people and it&rsquo;s impossible for the danger not to be perceived as _imminently lethal_.  Because we know that a bunch of blacks together will either stand around and watch a victim be beat up and do nothing.  Or join in.</p>
<p>Which is why the **very instant** you have mob conspiracy, you should have instant arrests, very public trials and &#8216;aggravated&rsquo; consequences-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Subdivision 1.First degree.Whoever, while committing a robbery, is armed with a dangerous weapon or any article used or fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably believe it to be a dangerous weapon, or inflicts bodily harm upon another, is guilty of aggravated robbery in the first degree and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 20 years or to payment of a fine of not more than $35,000, or both.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.245&amp;year=2010" rel="nofollow">https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.245&year;=2010</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 20 years or half a black man&rsquo;s life, if he was 15 when he pulled this stunt.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The mob robbery at the Holiday store happened just before a shooting incident down the street where two people were injured. St. Paul police are looking into whether the two cases are connected. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>You dumped a veritable horde of Somalis and other unwanteds on innocent white populations and now you are &#8216;surprised&rsquo; that Africa came with them.  _Get Control, Now_.  Or lose it forever.</p>
<p>These people only understand the rule of force.</p>
<p>White, Native, Minnesotan&rsquo;s are good people.  So wide eyed and kind to strangers it&rsquo;s a crying shame that they must be taught to _fight back_ like this.  Because those charged with protecting them will not.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a common occurrence in this city. Higher end shopping malls in the tourist areas have had these group thefts, not to mention the wildings that go on even in crowded areas. They&rsquo;ve become increasingly bold in the past few years. For them it&rsquo;s really a kind of urban sport, showing off to their admiring friends how daring they are. The media never reports it unless they have to, for fear of harming the tourist trade.   </p>

		<p>Not a robbery.  Indeed&hellip;.not a crime.  The point isn&rsquo;t to steal stuff.  The point is separation.  Blacks are seeking separation in the most direct manner&hellip;through ethnic cleansing.  Literally driving out the white man&rsquo;s civilization.</p>

		<p>Wilding, mob theft, polar bear hunting and regular &#8220;in your face attitudes&#8221; among blacks, seems quite indicative to the northern and west coast regions. </p>
<p> Please excuse my regional observations but this stuff happens far-far less frequently in the south. Despite significantly higher numbers of blacks down here, they&rsquo;re more civil overall. Many still seem to fear that perceived invisible heavy- hand the south was once known for. Tighter family structure and church might be a partial explanation as well.</p>
<p>Things are changing though. I might not be able to make this claim years from now.</p>

		<p>The easy part is dealing with the kids.  What will be hard to confront are the follow up demonstrations and riots in their support, to which the political elite typically cave, even cater.  At some point white, or, if you will, mainstream, America must say no more, no more, no damn more, to the larger community from which these roaming bands of barbarians emerge, and into which they blend. </p>

<p>An unlikely scenario that would only likely give more kids to do it, couched in a ridiculous religious myth mode.  Not only was there no white Christ, but Christianity doesn&rsquo;t care about race on way or the other, just that everyone becomes one.  No help at all.</p>

		<p>But Lutheran Groups, and Catholic Groups and Jewish Groups continue to demand that more &#8220;refugees&#8221; be brought from the lowest scale countries into Minnesota.  Somalis.  Hmongs.  Any non-white can come and get lots of welfare on the back of the Minnesota tax payer, so these religious groups can feel confident that they are buying their way into heaven.  </p>

		<p>News casters noted that they were young, kind of missed the race thing.  It would be truly shocking if it was a white gang.  Of course there are those that will see in this event the victims of slavery and racism acting out in defiance to the oppressor.  Ahem, this is no economic crime, it recreational mayhem.</p>

		<p>Thanks for that, Anonymous at 5:48 PM, I got a good ironic laugh when I saw that ad was exactly as you described it!</p>
<p>Notice there was some mild tut-tutting in the news report, but that&rsquo;s all. No strong denunciations of this uncivilized behavior, like the kind the MSM would normally reserve for, say, Tea Party activists, much less someone who would dare to make a (gasp!) &#8220;racist&#8221; statement. </p>
<p>Notice also that when the reporters were talking among themselves at the end of this piece about &#8220;how young they are,&#8221; it had a double meaning. It could be interpreted as &#8220;How could someone so young already be committing such a serious crime,&#8221; but what they really meant was, &#8220;Look how young and innocent they are! They mustn&rsquo;t be prosecuted too harshly for this! They didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing!&#8221; Notice that&rsquo;s all they could bring themselves to say: &#8220;Look how young they are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice also the use of the word &#8220;kids&#8221; in this article. In long bygone years, these thieves would have been called thieves, which is exactly what they are. Later, they would have been called, &#8220;hooligans&#8221; or &#8220;ruffians&#8221; and even that would be mild. Then in the 1960&rsquo;s they would have been called &#8220;juveniles,&#8221; but even that has connotations too harsh for our modern delicate ears. </p>
<p>The MSM can&rsquo;t use the word &#8220;youths&#8221; because that is reserved for political riots and the MSM risks sullying a perfectly good euphemism. So it resorts to using the cute and cuddly sounding &#8220;kids.&#8221; As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if someone is six feet tall and uses their imposing physical presence to commit a crime, they&rsquo;re no longer a &#8220;kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s been an escalation in politically-correct pandering over the years. If this keeps up, we won&rsquo;t even be able to disapprove of this behavior in the future, much less report on it. That&rsquo;s the Marxist path we&rsquo;re headed down, folks! Get ready for it!</p>

After 45 years of wasted billions and still counting on Head Start, Race to the Top, affirmative action, social programs, etc. blacks are no better.  This is ALL wasted tax money.

<p>Well, the news report showed two other similar mob robberies, and both appeared to be all blacks to me. I&rsquo;m impressed that the station did that. Certainly viewers can&rsquo;t be so blind as to not notice that the &#8220;young people&#8221; in all three mobbings were all black.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cited at least 20 of them for curfew violations that night,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Robberies before curfew are acceptable I guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;but more serious charges are possible with the kind of mob mentality police say could get even more dangerous for both workers and customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this just poor writing, or is there an implication that individual shoplifting is not a big deal?</p>
<p>The problem is not that they entered the store in a group, but that they ROBBED the store!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The inclination might be to try to stop it. We don&rsquo;t want people to do that. We want store employees to be witnesses to shoplifting, not victims of assault,&rsquo; says Skoogman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s not what I want. I want the employees of the store to shoot them as they exit with boxes of stolen goods under their arms, and for there not to be any legal repercussions for it, in spite of the fact that about 90% of the allegedly edible goods in such stores are about as worthless as the thieves.</p>

Of course, the people who own these stores often care more about their merchandise than they do their employees.  Otherwise, convenience marts in ghetto and barrio neighborhoods would always be these types of fortresses.<br>
We are fast descending into a second Dark Age in which security has become a top priority for daily living.  Even upscale white neighborhoods are under assault from black and Hispanic criminals who simply drive to their targets.<br>

<p>What&rsquo;s to be done? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m truly sorry that decent black folks have to live with the reality: Skin color is more reliable than any other sociological factor as an indicator of antisocial tendencies. The worst thing I can think of to say about sociopathic white people anymore is that they don&rsquo;t deserve to be white.</p>

<p>That is rather creepy. Don&rsquo;t worry about the employees who can seal themselves behind bullet proof glass, worry about any innocent customers who are trapped inside a store with panicking thieves! In my old neighborhood all the stores ended up with bullet proof glass, as much as I hated it I did realize it lowered the chances of a robbery gone bad and customers getting caught in the crossfire, so in a way the bullet proof glass protects the innocent customers too.</p>

		<p>The same type of incident happened to a friend of mine who worked for a 7-11 store in St Louis city a few years back. Though they had a different style of organization to it.  Two large, and intimidating blacks stood on opposite sides of him, not openly brandishing weapons, but implying that they had them. They didn&rsquo;t say a word. While they did that, another dozen to eighteen blacks stormed the store, robbed as much of the liquor, cigarettes, and other items as they could carry. Some of them came back for a second go. When the last of their grabbers was out the door, the two men told my friend behind the counter to get on the floor, and then calmly walked out the door. </p>
<p>I have no idea what happened to the people who robbed the 7-11, nor if any of them were eventually caught. I only know my friend decided the risk of them getting violet was too great, and quit working there a few days later. </p>
<p>This type of attack is not a new thing, and its certainly not an isolated incident. I would be surprised if MN law didn&rsquo;t automatically tack on a few years to sentences if someone gets hurt in any way. This type of thing needs to be harshly prosecuted, with all of their pictures displayed in the paper with the sentences they get. Anything less than that will only encourage future incidents. </p>

<p>If they were ever caught, the good news (good for our side) is that even if the two that claimed they had guns didn&rsquo;t have them, they still could have been charged and convicted for the most serious classification of robbery (armed) in this state, because in the eyes of our state&rsquo;s law, saying that you have a gun in order to rob someone is the same as actually having a gun.
