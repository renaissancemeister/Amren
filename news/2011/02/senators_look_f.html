<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/48956.html">Senators Look for Immigration Deal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Budoff Brown, Politico, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have rekindled their alliance on immigration reform, taking some early steps to test the political will for addressing the contentious issue this year.</p>
<p>Their call list hasn&rsquo;t focused so much on House and Senate members who&rsquo;ve been reliable pro-immigration votes in the past. Instead, they&rsquo;re looking to a strange-bedfellows mix of conservative and liberal constituencies that can provide a &#8220;safety net&#8221; of support, as Graham put it, once the issue heats up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For all the groups getting a call from the pair, it is the presence of Graham himself who elevates the odds  &mdash;  however bleak  &mdash;  that the Senate could move on a comprehensive, bipartisan overhaul bill. Graham abruptly departed the talks last spring and took with him any hope of getting a bill in the past Congress.</p>
<p>Now, conservative evangelicals, the AFL-CIO, the Service Employees International Union, business organizations and immigrant advocacy groups say they have gotten word from Schumer&rsquo;s office that a renewed effort is under way. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce confirmed that it is back in the mix, after a hasty exit last year when Schumer proposed a legislative framework with a temporary worker program that favored labor unions.</p>
<p>And Schumer and his staff have quietly begun reaching out to some unlikely players in the Senate, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who has professed a newfound freedom since winning reelection last year without the Republican Party&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The task won&rsquo;t be easy. For starters, Republicans control the House, and they can&rsquo;t say it often enough: A pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants won&rsquo;t fly on their watch.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, advocates of comprehensive reform see some reason for optimism.</p>
<p>Democrats believe the November elections put a bit of a scare into Republicans, who failed to capture the Senate in part because of strong Latino turnout in California, Nevada, Colorado and Washington. If the GOP hopes to win the White House in 2012, it will need to reverse that trend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>House Republican leaders blocked Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a foe of illegal immigration with a penchant for harsh rhetoric, from taking over the immigration subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee  &mdash;  signaling that they are sensitive to the political pitfalls of alienating Latinos. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) has also shied away, at least for now, from pursuing the most divisive proposals, such as revoking birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>And in one closely watched comment, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) let it slip recently that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) &#8220;seems to think that there&rsquo;s a shot at this.&#8221; It led to a round of speculation that the McCain of the past, the senator who ushered a comprehensive bill through the chamber in 2006, might be ready to come back.</p>

		<p>Sen. Graham would sell out his own mother to further his political ambitions.  Unfortunately, the voters of SC just re-elected this embarrassment in &#8216;08.  I suppose they all suffered short term memory loss or were just clueless to begin with, since it was Graham after all, who referred to anyone not in support of a path to citizenship for illegals as &#8220;bigots&#8221;.  </p>

<p>Yeah, well they won&rsquo;t reverse that trend by giving the Dems 11 million more voters, now, will they?</p>
<p>Someone really needs to find a way to oust Senator Grahamnesty from office.</p>

<p>It should indeed have put a scare into the Republicans.  If 20 million illegal aliens get amnesty no Republican will ever win an election again   &mdash;   unless he&rsquo;s a Democrat who calls himself a Republican, like Lindsey Grahamnesty.  The Democrats and the far left Service Employees International Union know this all too well.</p>

		<p>Now that the election smoke has cleared the lizards are slithering out of their holes and circling the body of the sick &amp; dying USA. They never quit. They change their spots like the chameleons that they are, but they never really change. Now that he&rsquo;s won reelection, the evil John McCain is ready, once again, to flip the bird to his constituents and to sell them out for a few latino votes. Snakey Shumer and creepy Graham are teaming up with the vile Ms. Murkowski to flip the bird to the entire U.S. It&rsquo;s deja vu all over again gang! Watch the bean under the cup! You&rsquo;ll never guess which one its under&hellip;. unless they rig it so that you do! If that happens, hold on to your wallet and watch your back!</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s only one acceptable policy for immigration.  </p>
<p>Zero legal immigration.  Zero illegal immigration.  Repatriation of anyone who wasn&rsquo;t born in the USA, whether they&rsquo;re here legally or illegaly.  </p>

		<p>The only thing that surprises me here is that McAmnesty has waited only less than three months to show his true colors again. Even I didn&rsquo;t expect him to turn so quickly on the people of Arizona. I knew he would, but to slap them in the face so soon is a new low for this traitor to the USA.</p>

		<p>So the traitor McCain is back at it again, as head cheerleader for 20 million illegal invaders in this country demanding their amnesty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad McCain cannot work as hard for the American citizens who elected him to represent their interests, as he does the 20+ illegal invaders who are in full reconquista mode!</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a day that goes by that he isn&rsquo;t championing amnesty for illegal invaders!</p>
<p>What a disgrace!</p>

		<p>John McCain is simply a despicable human being.  In his latest campaign he pretended to be strongly against illegal immigration in order to defeat his challenger, who really was opposed to illegal immigration.  He fooled Sheriff Paul Babeu, and apparently plenty of naive Arizona Republicans. </p>
