<h1>Marker Rejected for Slaves in South&rsquo;s Army</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Bell, Charlotte Observer, February 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Union County [North Carolina] is refusing to approve plans for a marker to commemorate slaves who served in the Confederate Army, raising questions of how to appropriately honor men virtually ignored by history.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Civil War&rsquo;s 150th anniversary, amateur historian Tony Way led the push for a granite marker to be placed at the Old County Courthouse in Monroe next to a 1910 Confederate monument. The new marker would be for 10 black men, nine of whom were slaves, who served the Confederacy during the war and eventually got state pensions.</p>
<p>It would probably be one of a few public markers of its kind in the country, experts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But county officials recently recommended the marker not go on the 1886 courthouse grounds, saying it would be inconsistent with other monuments. The existing Confederate monument cites regiments, not individuals. Other war monuments on the grounds name only those who died.</p>
<p>Earl Ijames, curator of community history and African-American history at the N.C. Museum of History, worked on proposed wording for the marker.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tremendous opportunity has been lost to have this outreach for black and white people to understand a facet of history that has been swept under the rug,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It re-enslaves them all over again&#8221; by not recognizing their service.</p>
<p><b>Slaves in the army</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nearly all of the work that blacks did for the Confederacy was support and logistical, from building latrines to working in armories. Some slaves could have been hoping for more favorable treatment back home because of their service, Ijames said.</p>
<p>Almost no black men fought in battle for the Confederacy, Blight [David Blight, a Civil War expert at Yale University] said. He added that though it&rsquo;s impossible to know how many slaves went willingly, many bolted for the Union lines the first chance they got.</p>
<p>Still, there have been occasional commemorations of the South&rsquo;s slaves. At Tyrrell County&rsquo;s courthouse in Eastern North Carolina, a 1902 Confederate statue includes the words, &#8220;To Our Faithful Slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For neo-Confederates, it was a way of legitimizing the Confederacy in the popular memory: &#8216;Look, the blacks supported us, too,&rsquo;&#8221; he [Blight] said. &#8220;If they were there, they were impressed or ordered into service. They were not soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Eventual pensions</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Way, the historian, {snip} and several friends {snip} found records for 10 black pensioners, including a free man, Jeff Sanders.</p>
<p>All were described as &#8220;body servants&#8221; or bodyguards, even Sanders. Some hauled supplies, carried water or cooked. At least two were wounded.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Southern states began providing Civil War pensions in the 1880s; only Mississippi did not exclude blacks. In 1927, N.C. law finally let people of color seek pensions  &mdash;  but only if they went to war as laborers or servants.</p>
<p>&#8220;They essentially got pensions by being loyal slaves,&#8221; Blight said.</p>
<p>Fewer than 200 sought N.C. Civil War pensions, Ijames said. They got annual pensions of $200, about $2,550 today.</p>
<p>In Union County, most of the 10 men had an average age of 90 when their pensions began.</p>
<p><b>County concerns</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commissioners sent the request to the county Historic Preservation Commission, which recommended that no new marker go on the courthouse grounds unless there was a major new conflict to commemorate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The county manager agreed with the group&rsquo;s assessment. Staff told county commissioners they did not recommend the marker be added and recently told Way of the decision.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p> &#8220;If you go back 100 years later and put up a supplement to the monument, with names, it elevates the 10 people by name above the 500 other people who died,&#8221; Surratt [County preservation commission Chairman Jerry Surratt] said. &#8220;(It) would turn a race-neutral monument to be racially a step backwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ijames called it disingenuous to think a monument erected in 1910 at the height of the Jim Crow era would have been intended to honor contributions by black residents.</p>

		<p> The powers-that-be who authorize what type of Civil War memorials (and memories) will be honored as &#8220;true&#8221; and which won&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t want the fact of black men actually fighting for the Confederacy to gain any credence. It would put a major speedbump in the way of their depiction of Southern blacks as all unwilling slaves, ready to bolt for freedom at the slightest chance.</p>
<p> It would also confirm numerous old documents showing that blacks did, indeed, fight for the Confederacy   &mdash;   perhaps as many as 65,000 of them. It appears that a significant number thought of themselves as Southerners first, then blacks. And they viewed the Union Army as an invading force.</p>

		<p>Servants and logistical support [what it would be called today]. For the most part accompanying the master when the master was an officer or a senior commander.</p>
<p>And most did so willingly and did not &#8220;bolt&#8221;. Including those belonging to the unit of Nathan Beford Forrest. Strange as it may seem it is true.</p>
<p>Combat arms perhaps only in the most dire of circumstances.</p>
<p>This is intriguing matter for a historian seeking a PhD? But I bet it would be very controversial.</p>

		<p>When I was in grammar school in the 1960s we were taught that people thought of themselves as citizens of their states first and the US as a whole second.  That was why so many whites, the overwhelming majority of whom were NOT slave owners, and quite a few blacks, fought for the CSA, not to defend slavery but to defend their homeland.</p>

		<p>This report is WRONG.  I want everyone who comes to this posted column about this rejected marker to PLEASE go to the link that I HOPE works.  This is an online copy of a journal made by Lewis H. Stiener, a Northerner journalist who got caught in a Maryland town that was briefly occupied by a division of Confederates.  He reports about 3,000 black troops with arms of all sorts serving in a combat force with white Southerners altogether about 64,000 strong.  Go there, read it and tell us if my eyes are deceiving me.  But I have heard of this in other places as well.  I seems that history really is being revisioned actively by Adam Bell in Charlotte, NC right now!</p>
<p>Just think of the stir if this report, photographed as real pages from the actual printed journal to enhance its authenticity, which I found online - IT&#8221;S STILL THERE! ; If it were to be known to the larger American public.  3,000 blacks willingly served in that division alone!</p>

<p>A child could see that&rsquo;s exactly what it was.</p>
<p>The War of Yankee Aggression shows how willingly most people are to follow their leaders into senseless mass slaughter. How did Lincoln get so many apparent lunatics to sign up to die for &#8220;The Union&#8221; ? </p>
<p>When potential volunteers started to get smart, Lincoln instituted conscription-for the first time in US history-to save his dubious cause. </p>

&#8220;Meanwhile, newspapers such as the Detroit Free Press were perhaps more accurate in interpreting the motives of the rioters: &ldquo;There is no good reason why one man should be exempt and another compelled to perform military duty, simply because one happens to have temporarily more money than another&hellip; . If he has wealth, he has more reason to fight for its protection than the man who has nothing.&rdquo;[xxvii] Likewise, the New York News encapsulated the frustrations of the protestors and the reasons which drove them into the streets for retribution: &ldquo;It is a strange perversion of the laws of self-preservation which would compel the white laborer to leave his family destitute and unprotected while he goes forth to free the negro, who, being free, will compete with him in labor.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Those claiming that blacks served in the Confederate army are making silly claims.  Certainly there were slaves in support roles - drivers, laborers, etc. - and certainly some, once in while, under some circumstances, picked up a rifle and took part in combat.  </p>
<p>But blacks did not serve in the army in any significant way.  People who claim they did must address some questions that they just can&rsquo;t answer satisfactorily.  For examply, in 1863 Gen. Cleburne made a detailed argument, in writing to his superiors, recommending that slaves be recruited and offered freedom in return for military service.  He believed this was essential for victory as the Confederacy was facing an acute and worsening shortage of manpower.</p>
<p>Cleburne&rsquo;s recommendation got nowhere and he was harshly critized for making it.  </p>
<p>If blacks had been serving in the army, as some claim, why would the recommedation be met with such outrage?  For that matter, if blacks were already serving, why would Cleburne have made the recommendation at all?</p>

<p>Two additions:  (1)  Most of the &#8220;poorer&#8221; whites in NYC who couldn&rsquo;t buy their way out of service were recent Irish immigrants, and (2)  They and most others noted the hypocrisy of being forced to go liberate blacks while their own children were chained to factory machinery to be slave labor for the industrialists egging on Lincoln and his quest to liberate blacks. </p>

		<p>I would rather the honor of the South remain it&rsquo;s honesty.  Slavery was the reason the North invaded.  The underlying reality of a &#8216;free labor&rsquo;, as mercantile socialist controlled economics, system was a threat to those looking to set up a centralized banking economy which we all know has done -such great things- for our nation&hellip; (rolling eyes).</p>
<p>The South&rsquo;s reasons for fighting were simpler: they did not believe it was the North&rsquo;s right to ruin them for want of exercising control over what kept them fed.  Such proselytizing interventionism pushed on an internally stable economic system is gratinigly offensive to any adult that has stepped beyond the dominance of their parents&rsquo; door.  There was never any threat of whites enslaving whites in the South.  Never any threat of the South demanding the North submit to occupation as enforcement of slavery laws.  Though indenturement of white domestics was common enough in the New England states.</p>
<p>While it is true that the slaves made the Southern economic system possible, the fact remains that it was not the slaves who fought the Northern Aggression.  But the whites who believed _the land_ of the Confederacy was theirs.  As their home and their way.</p>
<p>And they were right.</p>
<p>And the sadness is that the rate at which King Cotton leached the soil, the British made Egyptians slave to the same plant and mechanization would have changed everything, anyway, in 20 more years, is the unrecorded truth that counters any altruistic motives the Abolitionists claim to have had.</p>
<p>Southern Slave Economics would have come to an end, regardless.</p>
<p>So it is that Northern Aggression was a vileness that was not only unnecessary but acted against a common racial good for the sake of commercial and political gains by the North&rsquo;s own elites.</p>
<p>Blacks were and are the original &#8216;enablement industry&rsquo; purchased victims by which we divided ourselves, internally, unnecessarily and we should be ashamed of that racial sellout.</p>
<p>Not seek to aggrandize it.</p>
<p>For loyalty to ourselves is what Lincoln really meant when he said this _nation_ must remain whole, whether with slaves or without them.</p>

		<p>I agree, the report is dead wrong.  Thousands of black served in the Confederate army, and NOT &#8220;just&#8221; in &#8220;logistics, servants,&#8221; etc. Louisiana had troops of all colors fighting in our ranks, including Cherokees, Mulattoes, blacks, Mexicans, and Jews.</p>

<p>Silly?  Now there&rsquo;s a criticism.</p>
<p>I refer you to my Post #5.  Go to the ling there and read the report of journalist Lewis H. Steiner. The journal is authenticated as a historical document.  He obviously hated the rebels, but wrote in matter of fact fashion when reporting on the armed black troops.  I read in the Slave Narratives that some blacks were forced to fight, but having this source tells me that that is a lie or exaggeration at best.  No one could force a group of 3,000 armed people to fight, especially if they were embroiled in such an issue as this case.</p>

		<p>Servants, are you kidding? Don&rsquo;t you watch TV or go to the movies? The blacks were Undercover Generals because according to what they promote on TV and in Movies the poor ignorant white man must have the black genius to guide their footsteps or they won&rsquo;t know what to do. Only the Super Intelligent black can save the day?</p>

		<p>   Vietnam era draftees were impressed and ordered into service, were they not soldiers ?<br>
   Lincoln was dead set against the use of black troops until he had to face the possibility that without them the Union just might lose the war.<br>
   My ma in law who passed a while back at the age of 75 used to stop by black houses and go in to get breakfast as they walked to school . <br>
   Most of our parents who grew up in the Great Depression/WW2 era lived in tenant houses themselves that you could see the dogs, cats and chickens through the cracks in the floor and they all picked cotton . <br>
   There was very little prosperity in the south until after WW2. And of course whites were essentially ordered to give a lot of that up after Brown vs Board . <br>
   Growing up in the 50s there seemed to be a little more animosity there . I would guess it was fueled largely by the growing civil rights movement . <br>
   It used to be kind of like a chess game in the south between the blacks and the whites . Give and take . The two groups mistrusting each other, despising each other and yet caring for each other . You would almost have to be Southern to understand . Brown vs Board has had a large hand in changing all of this . <br>
   And with non-southern blacks flooding into the South with chips on their shoulder as big as &#8216;48 Buicks, the southern white will soon find himself in a very precarious position .   </p>

<p>Not really. Thanks to the Obama-inspired revival of the 2nd Amendment, whites here in Dixie are more heavily armed than ever. And thanks to the greatly enhanced self-defense laws passed during the last decade in Texas, Florida and elsewhere, we&rsquo;re able to use those weapons if and when needed.</p>
