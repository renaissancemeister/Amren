<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/feb/27/support-poll-support-far-right">Searchlight Poll Finds Huge Support for Far Right &#8216;If They Gave Up Violence&rsquo;</a></h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Huge numbers of Britons would support an anti-immigration English nationalist party if it was not associated with violence and fascist imagery, according to the largest survey into identity and extremism conducted in the UK.</p>
<p>A Populus poll found that 48% of the population would consider supporting a new anti-immigration party committed to challenging Islamist extremism, and would support policies to make it statutory for all public buildings to fly the flag of St George or the union flag.</p>
<p>Anti-racism campaigners said the findings suggested Britain&rsquo;s mainstream parties were losing touch with public opinion on issues of identity and race.</p>
<p>The poll suggests that the level of backing for a far-right party could equal or even outstrip that in countries such as France, the Netherlands and Austria. France&rsquo;s National Front party hopes to secure 20% in the first round of the presidential vote next year. The Dutch anti-Islam party led by Geert Wilders attracted 15.5% of the vote in last year&rsquo;s parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Anti-fascist groups said the poll&rsquo;s findings challenged the belief that Britons were more tolerant than other Europeans. &#8220;This is not because British people are more moderate, but simply because their views have not found a political articulation,&#8221; said a report by the Searchlight Educational Trust, the anti-fascist charity that commissioned the poll.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 39% of Asian Britons, 34% of white Britons and 21% of black Britons wanted all immigration into the UK to be stopped permanently, or at least until the economy improved. And 43% of Asian Britons, 63% of white Britons and 17% of black Britons agreed with the statement that &#8220;immigration into Britain has been a bad thing for the country&#8221;. Just over half of respondents  &mdash;  52%  &mdash;  agreed with the proposition that &#8220;Muslims create problems in the UK&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP who fought a successful campaign against the British National party in his Dagenham and Rainham constituency in east London, said that the findings pointed to a &#8220;very real threat of a new potent political constituency built around an assertive English nationalism&#8221;. The report identified a resurgence of English identity, with 39% preferring to call themselves English rather than British. Just 5% labelled themselves European.</p>
<p>Earlier this month David Cameron delivered a controversial speech on the failings of &#8220;state multiculturalism&#8221;. The speech was seized on by the anti-Islamic English Defence League, which said that the prime minister was &#8220;coming round&#8221; to its way of thinking. BNP leader Nick Griffin also welcomed the speech as a sign that his party&rsquo;s ideas were entering &#8220;the political mainstream&#8221;.</p>
<p>The poll also identified a majority keen to be allowed to openly criticise religion, with 60% believing they &#8220;should be allowed to say whatever they believe about religion&#8221;. By contrast, fewer than half  &mdash;  42%  &mdash;  said &#8220;people should be allowed to say whatever they believe about race&#8221;.<br>

<p>Maybe the association is largely in their own minds.  But I don&rsquo;t think the immigrants they would want to expel will go quietly.</p>

		<p>This is a very interesting article.</p>
<p>It shows that the people of Britain aren&rsquo;t hopeless after all.<br>
It also demonstrates the power of the media.</p>
<p>This poll said that huge numbers of people would support nationalist parties if they weren&rsquo;t associated with &#8220;fascism and violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly which nationalist parties in the British political system openly advocate fascism and violence? I can&rsquo;t think of any.</p>
<p>However a certain media continuously attacks certain political parties as racist and fascist, though not necessarily explaining why. Perhaps this means that as social networks like Facebook and Twitter gain credibility, and as more people begin to depend on Internet news sources as opposed to mainstream television ones, opinions, votes, and consensus will gradually shift back towards truth and sanity. </p>
<p>One can hope.</p>

		<p>Has the BNP been committing any violence?  More than the left has been committing against them?  As for fascist imagery, that comes from the BBC and other liberal media.  They can&rsquo;t have a story about the BNP without showing old film clips of marching Nazis.<br>

<p>That poll number is interesting, but I&rsquo;m sure most of the other <br>
48% are just answering in the most politically correct fashionable way. I guess setting off bombs on London buses and trains, creating no go zones in formerly white neighborhoods, making demands for Sharia law, forced marriages, and demonstrating against returning British troops is not creating problems!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that a large minority of Blacks &amp; Asians who are of immigrant descent are also against immigration. The UK is ready for its own Tea Party. Griffin is the wrong guy, the BNP has a dirty past. Somebody from the mainstream must take the initiative.</p>

		<p>Straw dog.  Neither the BNP or EDL advocate violence.  BTW, the EDL is not a political party, it&rsquo;s an activist group which has hot and cold (mostly cold) relations with the BNP.</p>
<p>The results of this survey show why the media have to promulgate the falsehood, as demonstrated by this article&rsquo;s loaded and false headline, that the BNP does advocate violence and engage in it.  Game over if people get wind of the truth.  </p>
<p>If 48% of voters voted for the BNP under the current first past the post system, the BNP&rsquo;s leader would be PM easily and the BNP would have a majority in parliament easily.  (Note that NickG is stepping down in 2013.  This survey shows why the process to replace him is CRUCIAL, why they better get it right when it comes to picking a new leader.)</p>
<p>Note that Tony Blair remained PM after 2005&rsquo;s elections, wherein the Labour Party only got 35.2% of the popular vote.  David Cameron&rsquo;s Conservative Party only got 36.1% of the vote last year, and he&rsquo;s PM, even in a shared power sense with the Learning Disableds.  So the BNP getting 48% would be a rout, by comparison.</p>

		<p>&#8220;fewer than half &mdash; 42% &mdash; said &ldquo;people should be allowed to say whatever they believe about race&rdquo;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh, they must know what people are thinking! Maybe they are even having thoughts of apprehension themselves. </p>
<p>Lets be a bit more honest here. People of color are saying whatever they want about race. They&rsquo;re paid to criticise whites and the evils of &#8216;Britain&rsquo; in their activist groups, in the paper, and on campus. And eagerly hearing what people of color have to say considered &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whites have feelings of their own by they are frightened into shutting up about them. Only &#8216;bigot types&rsquo; say things. At least for whites. The reality is, many whites have already experienced the blatant and out in the open racism of non-whites. They don&rsquo;t know what to say and aren&rsquo;t allowed to talk about it, unlike racist, and seriously mislead, persons of color. They may not be allowed to talk about it but by their feet, their silence, and their action, it&rsquo;s obvious most whites don&rsquo;t want to experience more of their racism and hatred.</p>

		<p>The association between the &#8220;far right&#8221; and violence/fascism is a media fiction constantly portrayed by leftists.</p>
<p>Violence is just a natural way of life anyways, how do you think police officers, or the military, or anyone defends themselves and their country? It&rsquo;s all violence! But i guess out of sight out of mind.</p>
<p>@5  &mdash;  Dutchman<br>
A lot of people are wildly naive and brainwashed. They believe irrational leftist ideology and engage in circular reasoning and emotional appeals to back it up.</p>

		<p>A few other things:</p>
<p>1.  That 48% of Britons would vote for a &#8220;clean&#8221; nationalist party MIGHT be a deliberate statistical overstatement by the far left Searchlight kooks.  For much the same reason Morris Dees &#8220;needs&#8221; thousands of &#8220;hate groups&#8221; out there.  Fund-raising.  Though I should say that if it&rsquo;s even half that in reality, 24%, that&rsquo;s still enough to win beaucoup seats in Parliament under FPTP, and be the king makers under the right circumstances, a la the Learning Disableds last year.</p>
<p>2.  Like I said above, the EDL and BNP have mostly cold relations.  The reason for that is archaic   &mdash;   EDL big wigs still think the BNP of today is the BNP of the Tyndall era, vehemently against a certain small Middle Eastern country and its majority ethnicity.  The EDL is definitely for that country, and its members have waved that country&rsquo;s flag in its public protests and street theater.  In reality, NickG has moved the BNP to neutrality on those issues.  So much so that as of last year, the BNP had a Jewish member who won a public election to a city council seat.  The Post-NickG BNP could migrate to the EDL&rsquo;s position, or halfway between there and where they are now.</p>

		<p>What violence does the far-right condone?</p>
<p>This just proves that the liberal media still has too much influence on your average citizen.  The same can be said in the USA as well.  I wish the survey would have asked the people this follow-up question based on their response:</p>
<p>&#8220;What specific violence should the far-right denounce?&#8221;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you name some examples of far-right violence?&#8221;</p>
<p>I still do not give Britain hope, they are too dumb in the sense of what is actually happening to their country.  The ones that do not get slaughtered or enslaved after the muslim revolt will come the America and claim refugee status.</p>

		<p>This is exactly why I left the National Alliance, founded by William Pierce, and became more interested in American Renaissance.  Pierce, whom I met personally on several occasions, actually liked the Nazis and the imagery associated with them.  But the U.S. fought and killed Nazis, and the imagery of thuggishness associated with fascists just isn&rsquo;t going to fly in the U.S.  The adverse reaction is just too deeply engrained in the public, and not only because of media brainwashing.  The Nazis pretty much were murderous barbarians at heart.  Any white movement drawing upon their methods or imagery is doomed to fail  &mdash;  and actually serves our enemies.</p>
<p>What is best about whites is the <i>civility</i> of our civilization.  That is what we must put forward as worthy of defending.  We must promote the idea (the truth) that the behaviors producing our benign and livable society are generated by the genetic code of white Europeans, and that is why no other people have created societies like ours.</p>
<p>I have supported AmRen because its tone and its solutions are at basis <i>civilized</i>, and its leader, Jared Taylor, is a gentleman.  Nationalist movements should move closer to the example of AmRen.  It would be a shame if some day our people had to resort to a violent defense of our identity.  But to build the white advocacy movement, we should exemplify what we defend.</p>

		<p>This poll cannot be taken seriously.Searchlight - the outfit that originated it area hard-left, fanatical anti-white hate group that has very strong links to the Communist Party, they are the type of thugs that punched and kicked Jared Taylor whilst he was giving a speech.<br>
  Searchlight are just doing this for publicity and their own foul, underhand purposes<br>
 I simply refuse to believe that a large proportion of subcon immigrants want further immigration stopped, how come so many of them strive might and main to bring all their relatives over?</p>

		<p>part of the irony is that because Muslims have refused to integrate, and take much more in benefits than they contribute and taxes, most Europeans realize that if the entire Muslim community were deported tomorrow, it would be an economic and fiscal windfall, and would reduce crime by around 80%.</p>
<p>all of the multiculturalist brainwashing has intimidated people, but not convinced them.</p>
<p>and not even the most skilled propagandists have been able to devise any argument at all, no matter how ridiculous, for why we need Muslims in Europe. </p>
<p>most European countries are curtailing immigration, now it&rsquo;s the battle of the birth rates:<br>
even with zero Muslim immigration into Europe, they will soon own the continent.</p>
<p>because Europe started to save itself too late, the only hope for survival now is lowered non-European birthrates combined with deportation of criminals, terrorist supporters, and those dependent on welfare.</p>

		<p>There is unfortunately zero chance of voters being able to dissociate &#8220;violence&#8221;from the so-called far-right.A controlled media actively promotes the lie at every opportunity,despite the fact that the violence that accompanies even the poorest attended EDL or BNP gathering is perpetuated by rent a mob outfits like Unite Against Facism,acting with impunity while a compliant police &#8220;service&#8221;looks on.The BNP has already done much to promote itself as a mainstream political party,but its membership is still presented in the media as being composed entirely of brutal shaven-headed stormtroopers. </p>

		<p>Ah, the fatal disease of the modern White man!   Cowardice.  Timidity.  An insane and irrational desire to be &#8216;liked&rsquo; and remain &#8216;respectable&rsquo; by the enemies who hate the white race&rsquo;s guts and who fully intend, if allowed to do so, to steal everything the white race has ever created - your nations, your technology, your medical advancements, and your women.  </p>
<p>Let me ask the AR community and the white nationalist community a question.   Did our White European ancestors have this sort of spineless, feminized, nauseatingly cowardly attitude when they set out to conquer the world and create Western Civilization?    Did our white ancestors here in America tip-toe over the Appalachian Mountains and move across the frontier wearing a pair of depends and shaking in their boots over the possibility that some Indian might come upon them and ask to see their hallway pass?     </p>
<p>Answer:  No.    Might makes right, and only the strong survive.  News Flash to the White race, white men in particular.   Its time to soak your pair in a bucket of miracle grow and stop begging minorities to &#8216;please&rsquo; let us survive.  Get off your hind parts and go on OFFENSE and stop letting the enemy dictate the language and terms of engagement.   </p>
<p>All options are on the table, people.  All options.   This is our survival we are talking about here, for crying out loud!</p>

		<p>Post # 15 bears upon this comment, in my estimation:  One thing<br>
to be acknowledged loud and clear is that it is presumptuous in<br>
the extreme to assume otherwise than that nowadays and increasingly so, there is almost certainly afoot a vast<br>
counterpart to the old COINTELRPO that is directed toward us. One key element almost certainly is to produce the appearances of hate groups, etc etc.  It is long overdue that AR devoted attention to the awareness needed to safeguard genuine organizations and sincere people.  As to whether NA has been compromised, the fact is that many utterances by Pierce fed into the assertions of &#8220;hate&#8221;/ &#8220;exremism&#8221;/ My sense has always beem that he was a dramatic exhibit of what the late Hans Eysenck termed a &#8220;P-factor personality&#8221; and that Pierce lacked the emotional qualities basic to leadership.  </p>

<p>Great post, Luke.</p>
<p>To 15  &mdash;  Charles Hastings:</p>
<p>Every publisher&rsquo;s designer of book covers keeps in mind the adage, &#8220;swastikas sell.&#8221; So the overall effect of the imagery you decry may be a bit two-sided in our culture. Possibly attractions to that imagery are often repressed and consciously denied, as with sex for many Victorians.</p>
<p>In any case, a broad spectrum of approaches that can appeal to all types is probably best. </p>

		<p>I must emphatically agree with Mr. Hastings&rsquo; post (No. 15).  A few years of failed thuggery is an image we should neither accept nor adopt in any way.  With the single exception of a warped sense of racial identity, the National Socialists were at heart progressives.  Their movement was un-American and anti-Western.  Follow Amren&rsquo;s lead on this.  We don&rsquo;t need twenty years of thuggery as the basis for our advocacy.  Instead,we have thousands of years of Western Civilization to draw upon.  The movement must capture the hearts and minds of the middle and upper middle class in order to go mainstream.  A bunch of Nazis goosestepping down Main Street will only derail any such effort.  </p>

		<p> &#8220;Ah, the fatal disease of the modern White man! Cowardice. Timidity. An insane and irrational desire to be &lsquo;liked&rsquo; and to remain &#8220;respectable&rsquo; by the enemies who hate the white race&rsquo;s guts and who fully intend, if allowed to do so, to steal everything the white race has ever created - your nations, your technology, your medical advancements, and your women.&#8221;</p>

<p>A most excellent post, Luke! (And Wulfstan&rsquo;s too.) I commend you both. </p>
<p>You understand &#8220;the deal&#8221;. But you forgot to mention the conquest and appropriation of our  <i>culture </i> and of our entire intellectual tradition and instutions  by the dominant  aliens   &mdash;   something that is in fact already largely a fait accompli, and which has been for many years now, even decades   &mdash;   to the point where <i>our</i> culture has largely become <i>theirs,</i> and is even regarded as such by many of our own people who consider it a thing foreign to them! </p>

		<p>Not to put a damper on anyone&rsquo;s parade, but don&rsquo;t take anything Searchlight says seriously.  They&rsquo;re an organization of unashamed anti-white racist communists run by an ex-con, and the last time anyone took them seriously (namely, the BBC) it cost the British tax payers over a million pounds due to slander charges, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>They make the UAF look like a group of gentlemen.  They&rsquo;re far more cunning, as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Huge numbers of Britons would support an anti-immigration English nationalist party if it was not associated with violence and fascist imagery&#8221;<br>
Well, both the British National Party and (to a lesser extent) the UK Independence Party (which favors withdrawal from the EU and immigration restriction, but has a more libertarian bent on economics) should fit that description. The BNP isn&rsquo;t made up of Nazis. By and large, they&rsquo;re working-class Britons who&rsquo;ve had to deal firsthand with the problems caused by mass immigration into the country.<br>
I find it interesting that the Asians in Britain were more strongly in favor of &#8220;immediately halting&#8221; immigration than whites, while being less likely to say that immigration has been a bad thing for the country. Then again, it probably has something to do with the fact that many of the immigrants are muslim, while much of Britain&rsquo;s &#8220;Asian&#8221; population is Indian (they don&rsquo;t exactly have a happy history with the muslims).<br>

		<p>A Searchlight poll of Searchlight members reveals that 100 per cent of them would support &#8220;Far Right&#8221; parties if they embraced multiculturalism, feminism, gay rights and open-door mass immigration.</p>

		<p>So what violence did the BNP, or English Defense League commit? If they were involved in anything, it had to be strictly a self-defense matter, where they were being attacked by non-Whites, and Communist Thugs. </p>
<p>Showing White natives who are peacfully protesting, slugging it our with those that attacked them, makes great Media Spin for the Cameras, and the ones who own those cameras, and the &#8220;News&#8221; Stations that will broadcast it.</p>
<p>Preception is everything in this game. It&rsquo;s time to start making our own preceptions. </p>
