<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Soaring numbers of Hispanics and Asians pushed Virginia&rsquo;s population over 8 million in the past decade, transforming the state into a far more diverse place, according to census figures released Thursday.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s white population barely grew. As a result, fewer than two-thirds of all Virginians are now white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 2010 Census numbers underscore how the home of the former capital of the Confederacy is evolving into a mosaic of races and ethnicities from around the world. It has grown by a third in the past two decades, and its very character is changing. Today, seven of 10 Virginians live in three big urban areas, and Virginia&rsquo;s once-mighty rural areas are shrinking. Dozens of small towns, mostly in the rural southwest and Southside, lost residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Loudoun County was in a league of its own in the past decade, adding 142,000 residents. As with the state as a whole, much of the growth was fueled by minorities. The Asian population quintupled, Hispanics tripled and blacks doubled. Non-Hispanic whites increased at a much slower pace and today account for a little more than six in 10 residents in the county.</p>
<p>Statewide, the number of Hispanics almost doubled, to 632,000. Hispanics now make up 8 percent of Virginia residents, and a third are younger than 18, a harbinger of future growth as young people come of age and have children. In contrast, just about one in five of all non-Hispanics in Virginia is a child.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s Asian population also took off, climbing by 68 percent in 10 years.</p>
<p>In a state that in living memory had anti-miscegenation laws on the books, there was a striking jump in the number of Virginians who describe themselves as multiracial. The number rose from 90,000 to 233,000 in the past decade. A third of the growth was in Northern Virginia, and most of the rest was in the Hampton Roads area and Central Virginia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As recently as 1990, non-Hispanic whites made up 76 percent of the state&rsquo;s residents. A decade later, their numbers had fallen to 70 percent, and last year, they accounted for less than two-thirds of the state&rsquo;s residents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state&rsquo;s non-Hispanic black population held steady at just over 19 percent.</p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s Hispanic population has shown the most dramatic increase. Qian Cai, director of the demographics group at the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said immigration alone is not responsible for all the growth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Virginia faces additional deadline pressure because it is one of 19 states that must have its redistricting approved by the U.S. Justice Department, because of a past pattern of discrimination. Even now, minorities make up less than 15 percent of the 140 members of the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The redistricting creates opportunities for lawmakers from Northern Virginia, who have long complained that too many of the region&rsquo;s tax dollars are sent to other parts of the state.</p>

		<p>I think these articles are being to make whites believe that the future is already written and to just accept your(whites) fate.  I&rsquo;ve got news for them.  The stable society that whites have built, both here and in Europe, have allowed these massive gains by &#8220;minorities.&#8221;  The welfare, the hospitals, the free housing, the infrastructure.  There would be none of these if whites weren&rsquo;t the dominant culture.  </p>

<p>Such poetic joy over the elimination of whites.</p>
<p>In stage one, these reports always marvel at the glorious transformation from white to non-white.</p>
<p>Rarely do they report on stage two when things begin going down hill.<br>

<p>I understand what you are saying, but I think that the structures and management culture that whites put in place would go on for some time without whites before they completely collapse.  I think we will see the collapse within our lifetimes.</p>

<p>  So true.  The example that springs foremost to my mind is Rhodesia.  From the the bread basket of Africa to starving and jobless in less than two decades!  With South Africa to follow in due time, I can only wonder what the response will be.  Though given how race deniers love to completely ignore the realities of both Rhodesia and/or South Africa(and when they don&rsquo;t, blame them all on one or two black africans and then proceed to scream &#8216;racist!&rsquo; at the top of their lungs) I&rsquo;m guessing it will be minimal.</p>
<p>  We can&rsquo;t rely on other people to secure our future, that&rsquo;s our job.  I&rsquo;m firmly entrenched in the belief that if we don&rsquo;t save ourselves, then we were never worth saving in the first place.  The universe has no place for self-destructive and suicidal intelligence.  How hard could it be to get all the white &#8220;racists&#8221; and race realists to relocate to one area and start from there?  Orania did it, and that was with far more stringent criteria(you can&rsquo;t just be white), not to mention being surrounded by jealous blacks that could attempt to wipe them out on a whim whenever they choose.  So why can&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>As a white woman who was told to work hard get an education, work harder I collapse after every work day exhausted no time to date much less time to consider the luxuries of marriage and having children</p>
<p>When I go to the grocery stores I see huge black women with massive shopping carts full to the top, often with five or six children in tow, always paying with food stamp cards. </p>
<p>Rather than poor houses they get HUGE fancy 3 bedroom apartments which cost 3,000 a month on section 8. I can barely afford my 1500 a month tiny apartment while I try to save and dream of affording a 800,000 1000 sq foot house. </p>
<p>My tax rate is 32% federal + 5% misc/disability + 15% social security + 10% California = 62%. I basically work from January to July to pay taxes. </p>
<p>California is broke but that doesnt matter, they demand bailouts from the federal government&rsquo;s allotment of white tax payers money. </p>
<p>Anytime we get close to 60% the financial catastrophe nears. at 50% its game over. </p>

		<p>Carol Morello&rsquo;s excitement can barely be contained. In any case, in almost all such Washington Post dispossession stories the reader suddenly finds that the box the Post normally provides for reader commentary has strangely disappeared, as was true for this story.<br>

		<p>Correction on my post: It was an earlier Washington Post story, one about an announcement by the Census Bureau that 80+ percent of U.S. population growth is non-white, which did not allow comments, which is the norm. By some fluke, the Post is allowing comments on the Virginia story.</p>

		<p>I live in the Richmond area and have noticed the change.  As late as eleven years ago I would have said &#8220;What Hispanics?&#8221;.  Now they seem to make up all the construction crews and I can&rsquo;t go to Walmart (which I hate anyway)without hearing Spanish.  I&rsquo;ve also noticed more Asians.  I sat this morning in the DMV to renew my driver&rsquo;s license and I must have heard Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish while also seeing a few overweight white women with their mulatto offspring in tow.  </p>
<p>I live in a county that&rsquo;s run by Republicans who of course are pro-growth and pro-business.  The problem is that these Republicans don&rsquo;t seem to realize all the newcomers may make it impossible for them to be reeelected.<br>

<p>In the most recent issue of Middle American News, on page 3 - there is an article titled:  &#8220;Establishment Republicans Want to Back Off Immigration Issues&#8221;.</p>
<p>Look, people.   I&rsquo;ve said it once and I&rsquo;ll continue to hammer the point home until it FINALLY cracks through the thick skulls of all these white imbeciles who (a) Still worship Rush Bimbo, Sean Insanity, Glenn Beck or the Faux News Network - all of whom are Judas Goats, or (b) Are still too dumb to be able to identify the vast and fatal differences between a politician who has an &#8216;R&rsquo; next to their name, but who is a neo-con piece of Leon Trotsky worshiping, ML King Jr Commie-praising,  globalism loving, open borders &amp; white racial genocide lusting, war mongering trash    &mdash;    and a traditional, America-First, pro-white, racial realist conservative of the Sam Francis variety.   </p>
<p>Listen up, fellow AR readers.   &#8220;Establishment&#8221; Republicrats, as revealed in the MAN article cited above - are &#8216;neo-cons&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Neo-cons are the MORTAL enemy of every White man, woman and child. Neo-cons crave to genocide you and to destroy any future for your white children.   What more do I have to say to make you understand this sobering truth?  </p>
<p>Let me list a few names of these neo-con enemies, once again.  Please take notes.     The entire Bush family, the entire Rove family, the entire Cheney family, the entire Gingrich family, the entire Dick Army family, the entire blood-line of Lindsay Graham, the entire Hatch family, the entire Palin family - who, incidentally, was hand-picked by Bill Kristol, who is a flaming neo-con through and through.  Also, I heard that the Republicrats are now trying to float the cross-dressing, left-wing, nauseating clown &amp; hard-core neo-con war mongering Rudy Giuliani&rsquo;s name as a possible 2012 GOP candidate. Unbelievable!   Then there is Mike Huckabee, another religious fanatic and neo-con who is about 1 inch to the left of John Hagee, Mr. Armageddon Himself.  Huckabee would guarantee WW3 and get every white male combat soldier killed in wars that his favorite foreign nation demand we fight for them.  Oh, and while Juan McCain is now thankfully too old to make another run at the White House, he is also a neo-con and he is our enemy.  </p>
<p>Oh, and in case the AR community is infected with any of this white guilt disease and includes a few guilt-ridden, half-awake whites who still long for &#8220;white-guilt-absolution&#8221; and are casting fond eyes upon the likes of Alan Keyes - this black guy is a hardcore neo-con and he roomed with William Kristol during college.   He is stooge for the neo-cons, so shun him.  </p>
<p>Also, Colin Powell - another stooge that was created by the neo-cons for the clever purposes of appealing to whites who suffer a need for &#8220;white-guilt-absolution&#8221; and who are begging for some black politician they can support, to prove they are not &#8216;racists&rsquo;.  Powell is a leftist and a neo-con and will not lift one finger to help the white nationalist community or do anything to promote our legitimate ethnic interests.   Thankfully, Powell is also probably far too old, and long in the tooth now, to be used to buffalo the gullible white majority.  </p>
<p>So, in conclusion - let me assure Mr. Anonymous that the &#8216;establishment&rsquo; (read: neo-conned) GOP fully intends to shove a sharp knife in the backs of the millions of angry white conservatives who put them back into power.   Had those angry white conservatives had the intelligence and political savvy to recognize that their neo-con enemies had hijacked the Tea Party and that no sooner than they were returned to power, they would resume the very same agenda that lead to them being thrown out office last time - perhaps white conservatives could have voted more responsibly.     So, now the thing to do - is to purge every last greasy neo-con from the GOP, no matter how long it takes or no matter how deep these neo-con rats try to burrow down into the bowels the GOP to hide. Make the tag of &#8216;neo-con&rsquo; the kiss of death for any politician&rsquo;s political or government career.  </p>
<p>In the meantime, I say abandon the GOP and let your R&rsquo;s know why you are leaving.  Support the American Third Position (A3P) instead.    We are in a war, people.   The outcome of this war will determine whether or not White, Western Civilization survives in some form or is devoured by the Cultural Marxist enemies who have sought to destroy both it and the White race for the last 50-60 years.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I want to remind all the AR readers and white nationalist community of like-minded whites that what the Democrats did to the white majority since the Great Society income redistribution socialist programs, which LBJ and his pals enacted in the 1960s - with blacks as the recipients of well over $5 trillion dollars of money that was stolen from our families paychecks - these &#8216;Establishment&rsquo; (neo-con) Republicrats fully intend to duplicate, but this time they will get into a bidding war with the Democrats to see how much they can steal from the dwindling white majority in order to win the bidding war for Mexican votes.   Is that where we want to be, people?</p>
<p>Learn how to identify and recognize a NEO-CON!   Purge them completely or die a slow and agonizing death.  </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to lecture us about who we ought to listen to, at least write in proper English, since it must be your single and proud to be - language.  Genocide is a noun, not a verb.  Turning nouns into verbs is a habit acquired from modern Ebonics.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  Just their being below voting age explains a lot. As well as their disinclination to vote even when eligible.</p>
<p>Besides, is 66% even a historic low for whites in Virginia?  Sick as it may sound, whites were actually a minority in several states until 1950.  </p>

<p>So, most of the 632,000 hispanics are children?  Nonsense.  It may account for a certain percentage but the real answer is that these people are not US citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, is 66% even a historic low for whites in Virginia? Sick as it may sound, whites were actually a minority in several states until 1950.&#8221; </p>
<p>Tell us in your historical revision of &#8220;Amerika&#8221; which states those are?  This country was around 90 percent White in the twentieth century well into the 1960s until they changed the immigration laws. The continental US was overwhelmingly White and even in the Deep South most Southern states black populations didn&rsquo;t go over 20 percent. Anyone from that region knows that the South was alot Whiter 30, 40, 50 years ago than now.</p>
