<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20110215/US.Census.Black.Migration/">In a Reversal, More Blacks Moving Back to South</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Comcast News, February 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Great Migration, the 60-year escape from segregation and racism that brought American blacks to the North, has reversed course. Better jobs and quality of life in the South are beckoning, as is the lure of something more intangible  &mdash;  a sense of home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the shift is happening as we encounter economic turmoil that is being felt disproportionately among blacks, such as mortgage foreclosures, loss of jobs and economic devastation in major Northern hubs,&#8221; said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP&rsquo;s Washington bureau. &#8220;With major changes and less racial devastation in the South, people are finding their way back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s black population grew by roughly 1.7 million over the last decade. About 75 percent of that growth occurred in the South  &mdash;  primarily metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Miami and Charlotte, N.C. That&rsquo;s up from 65 percent in the 1990s, according to the latest census estimates. The gains came primarily at the expense of Northern metro areas such as New York and Chicago, which posted their first declines in black population since at least 1980.</p>
<p>Illinois had its first decline in the black population in the state&rsquo;s history, with the number of African-Americans decreasing by 1.3 percent since 2000, according to official 2010 census figures released Tuesday.</p>
<p>In all, about 57 percent of U.S. blacks now live in the South, a jump from the 53 percent share in the 1970s, according to an analysis of census data by William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution{snip}</p>
<p>The findings, based on 2009 data, are expected to be highlighted in official 2010 results that show changes in non-Hispanic black populations in states such as Texas, New York, Georgia and Florida. Illinois&rsquo; official 2010 data was released Tuesday. The recent census figures for blacks refer to non-Hispanic blacks, which the Census Bureau began calculating separately in 1980.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broken down by state, Georgia was tops in the total number of African-Americans, edging out New York state. It was followed by Texas, Florida and California. California in recent decades has seen its black population slip or remain largely unchanged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Frey noted that the continued Southern migration of blacks, who tend to vote Democratic, could have political implications as they flow into mostly Republican-leaning states. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama was able to win in traditionally GOP-leaning states such as Virginia, North Carolina and Florida after a jump in black voter turnout.</p>

		<p>2:  Most states allow convicted felons to vote if they&rsquo;re through with probation.  And if they&rsquo;re on probation, then they&rsquo;re probably not allowed to move out of state.  Ergo, most of these black felons would be allowed to vote.</p>

<p>Where?  Except for Texas, I can&rsquo;t think of any Southern states that are doing well economically.  I guess if you are Black or Hispanic, you can pretty much land any kind of government job if you have a high school diploma; but other than that, I just can&rsquo;t see it.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;as is the lure of something more intangible &mdash; a sense of home.&#8221;: I would say it is more an underlying sense of Nationhood.  A sense that as Whites become less and less of the overall population, and as Mexico reclaims the Southwest, that an embryonic African Nation in the Southeast is also felt as a possibility. As Blacks move in, Whites will eventually move out, or will become a segregated minority in a Black ruled South, to be taxed out of existence. Either way, a Black ethno-state in the Southeast is coming.  As for voting demographics, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. If it takes a hundred years to push out all the Whites, it won&rsquo;t matter if it is accomplished by the vote or by the gun, the result will be the same.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the implication of this report at all.  It makes it sound as if there is some &#8216;great reverse migration&rsquo; when all you&rsquo;re talking about is a few thousand here and there going south.  Those remaining behind are having more than enough illegitimate children to replace those who left.  I live in a northern city that is overrun with blacks and latinos and even asians.  Whites are down to only about 25% of the city.  I see no clearing in the clouds.</p>

		<p>In CIVIL WAR II, Thomas Chittum predicted all this. The US will eventually break into three nations  &mdash;  </p>
<p>1. A Latino nation in the Southwest<br>
2. A black nation in the deep South (south of Dalton, Georgia), which will curve up the eastern seaboard to New York<br>
3. A white nation in the center of the US, which will encompass the mountainous areas and the Midwest. Only whites make good farmers globally, plus whites do extremely well in mountainous regions. Non-whites do better in deltas and low-lying areas.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan points out that the Soviet Empire in 1990 became a number of separate nations based on race and ethnicity. Nations are more eternal, lasting for thousands of years, but must be racially homogeneous. Empires are multiethnic but are short-lived. In 1965, the US gave up the route of nationhood to become a multiethnic empire. We will eventually divide into separate nations. THE SOONER THE BETTER!</p>

		<p>To add to #2 drifter 745&rsquo;s comment: the South is turning more solidly Republican.  Whites there are voting more and more as a bloc, and, as long as they are in the majority, blacks can only win in heavily black districts.  Almost all blacks moving South will settle into black areas and simply cast a few more votes for the same black mayor or Congressman as most other blacks do.</p>

<p>No mention that a lot of this Southward black migration is not from the North, but from the West. Due to Mexicans ethnically-cleansing the poorer parts of SoCal   &mdash;   turning black ghettos into brown barrios   &mdash;   thousands of Af-Ams from Compton, Watts, South Central, etc, have decided they&rsquo;re better off with Bubba than with Pedro. </p>
<p>In fact, you might even say, &#8220;LA proved too much for the man, so he&rsquo;s leaving on that midnight train to Georgia&hellip;&#8221; </p>

The so called &#8220;Great Northern Migration&#8221; served little purpose. It ended up being two sides of the same coin. They merely swapped Dejure segregation for defacto and their economic situation as a racial group improved mediocre at best. Just look at the infrastructure of large and mid-size northern cities and judge for yourself. </p>
<p>&#8220;Obama money&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t cut it. Southern cities and surrounding counties are beginning to suffer the same effects. As time goes on it&rsquo;ll get worse,- unfortunately.</p>

		<p>Southern States like GA, NC, MS, LA, TX and FL will become minority dominated in a generation.  White conservatives will not be able to win elections in large parts of the South in the near future.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a lifelong Georgian, mostly as a metro Atlantan, and the state&rsquo;s unemployment rate has often been above the US average. I fail to see any opportunities here.<br>
I must also express my wry amusement that blacks are leaving the far more &#8220;open-minded&#8221; North for the so-maligned &#8220;bigoted&#8221; South.</p>

		<p>In an odd way, stories such as this make me smile, even though I myself am a white Southerner.  Let me explain&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Number 1) It shows that people enjoy being around people who are like them.  Number 2) I think this is a slap in the face to white liberal Northerners who love ranting about how racist and backwards white people in the South are, while priding themselves on providing &#8220;safe havens&#8221; up North for these blacks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I don&rsquo;t enjoy being around large groups of blacks. But I just can&rsquo;t help smile over this, particularly because of my reason number 2 above. Sorry, but I despise liberal Northern whites who love minorities while constantly bashing white Southerners. Stories like this are a huge slap in the face to their &#8220;evil Bubba and Billy Bob&#8221; propaganda.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to make is that Alabama is my home and I can&rsquo;t imagine leaving it.  White people in Alabama (when left alone by liberal Northerners) have historically been able to deal with living around black populations pretty easily through segregation etc&hellip;..Even today the state is still pretty segregated due to the fact that people naturally segregate themselves. </p>
<p>Even though Montana and Idaho or New Hampshire and Maine, seem real appealing to me as a white person in that they have a lush European-ness about them that the South has lost (not just because of the large black population we have but also due to the fact that most white people in the South have been here since the Revolution and tend to consider themselves American over European American)&hellip;&hellip;..despite all this, it will take a huge, ground breaking black take over to occur down here before I ever leave.  It is home for me down here, and my roots in the state go back really far.  I identify with the white culture down here more than with anywhere else.</p>

		<p>15-Courtney: 1) &#8220;I think this is a slap in the face to white liberal Northerners who&hellip;&#8221;: I agree, but I doubt the White Liberal Northerners would take offense.  They are more likely to attempt to find some lame excuse or to otherwise explain away their own failings.  More likely, they would blame White Conservative Northerners for making life so extremely difficult for Blacks that the Blacks felt they needed to leave.  Note: Please do not include all Northern Whites in the term &#8220;Liberal&#8221;. It is just not the case. As neither do all Northern Whites denigrate the South.<br>
2) &#8220;it will take a huge, ground breaking black take over to occur down here before I ever leave.&#8221;: I doubt you will ever need to leave the South, as I can&rsquo;t foresee such a change within our lifetimes. In the future though, maybe within the next 100 years such a change could occur.  I believe we in this time frame need to ensure we have some thoughts to our future survival as a race, so that our next generations can better prepare for what lies ahead.</p>
