			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Harrison, Telegraph (London), February 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A voluntary group banned from council meetings after its chairman was accused of racism for using the phrase &#8220;jungle drums&#8221; has now been reinstated.</p>
<p>The group, a health watchdog, has also had its funding restored after The Sunday Telegraph highlighted what the local MP described as a &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; case.</p>
<p>Wiltshire council asked all members of the Wiltshire Involvement Network to undergo &#8220;diversity training&#8221; but they refused and the local authority has admitted it has no powers to force them to do so.</p>
<p>Phil Matthews, deputy chair of the network, said: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve won and common sense has won. The council has caved in. We refused to apologise because the remark was not racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Councillors are now demanding an inquiry into how the case was allowed to drag on for six months at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense.</p>
<p>The council has not, however, rescinded its finding that the &#8220;jungle drums&#8221; remark was racist, even though the network&rsquo;s chairman, Anna Farquhar, insisted she used it to mean &#8220;gossip&#8221; or the &#8220;rumour mill&#8221;.</p>
<p>The row started in August when Mrs Farquhar, 70, chaired a meeting of WIN at the scout headquarters in Potterne, near Devizes. During a discussion about changes in the NHS, and how rumours about them can spread, she said: &#8220;You cannot help the jungle drums.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sonia Carr, 50, from Warminster. a member of the county&rsquo;s Racial Equality Council, who was in the public gallery, intervened and said the phrase was racist.</p>
<p>Mrs Farquhar a former chief executive of the county&rsquo;s St John Ambulance and ex-trustee of a local Citizens Advice Bureau, apologised immediately for any offence caused.</p>
<p>But Mrs Carr, of Warminster, lodged a formal complaint alleging racism under the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>The council launched an investigation, upheld the complaint and last month withdrew funding for WIN&rsquo;s administration costs.</p>
<p>The group, which represents patients&rsquo; interests at council meetings, rejected the racism allegations and, at a meeting last week, the council reinstated the watchdog and its funds, although it said that the remark was &#8220;inappropriate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mrs Farquhar, of Potterne Wick, near Devizes, said: &#8220;It is of great regret this matter has taken so long to resolve. It has caused me great personal stress and I will be glad to get back to work serving the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly never meant the remark to be racist. I&rsquo;m not a racist. It was just a remark that was made about stuff going around that people didn&rsquo;t know about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiltshire council said the meeting last week was &#8220;productive and both organisations agreed to continue to work together to support users and carers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mrs Carr declined to comment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that even now they are furiously plotting to close <i>that</i> embarrassing little loophole.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Councillors are now demanding an inquiry into how the case was allowed to drag on for six months at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Have these people never taken a look around them at the degenerate state of Once-great Britain today?  Tempest-in-a-teapot is the order of the day, where Race is concerned.</p>
<p>The only thing encouraging about this sad tale is that the &#8220;health watchdog&#8221; group steadfastly refused to undergo state-ordered brainwashing. It&rsquo;s refreshing to see something other than the usual ritual grovel.<br>

		<p>What is wrong with you White Racists? This is 2011 not 1852.<br>
What I would like to see done is for anything a white might wish to say is first it must be submitted in writing to The Kings and Queens of days gone by, for their approval. Now don&rsquo;t that make good sense to you too? <br>
These people have done so much for the poor pathetic white race to show them this much courtesy doesn&rsquo;t seem out of line. I know I am just like most of you, I do not want to do anything that might offend those who created the civilized world we live in. Not counting Detroit, Oakland, Chicago, Atlanta and a few other places in America that are the exception to the rule.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad the accused were reinstated.  But in a sense, the Wiltshire radicals scored a moral triumph because their targets felt it necessary to declare their non-racist bonafides in order to retain good standing.  What if the allegedly guilty parties really were &#8220;racists?&#8221;  Should they be ostracized?  It&rsquo;s an empty victory for our side, if a victory all the same.  </p>

<p><i>Councillors are now demanding an inquiry into how the case was allowed to drag on for six months at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense.</i></p>
<p>The answer:</p>
<p><i>But Mrs Carr, of Warminster, lodged a formal complaint alleging racism under the Equality Act 2010.</i></p>
<p>Both in the same article.</p>
<p>The solution:  Repeal the Equality Act of 2010, and any similar legislation.</p>

<p>The tunnel he must run thru to avoid being &#8216;a racist&rsquo; draws narrower and narrower with every pro-diversity edict. It&rsquo;s only whites who must conform or be tolerant however. The way I paraphrase their little game&hellip; You&rsquo;re a &#8216;racist&rsquo; unless you hate whites enough and with the proper enthusiasm and in the proper way.</p>

		<p>&lsquo;The law makes it clear that what matters is not the intention of the person who uses the phrase but whether anybody is offended by it.&rsquo; And thereby hangs a tale. A tale of typical african ignorance and racism, a complete disregard for the White country that now hosts her biased whining, carping, bitching mentality. &#8216;If it ain&rsquo;t black, it ain&rsquo;t good&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s just a great pity that this stupid and offensive &#8216;complaint&rsquo; was backed up by cringing, sacredly-cat councillors who would rather insult and revile a decent old White lady with a long history of unpaid, dedicated loyal public service than simply ignore this insult by some obese loud-mouthed black with a well known local history of making trivial and baseless &#8216;racial&rsquo; complaints against White citizens. The following report reveals all. But I suppose you in USA will be well used to this behavior and now we in White England are expected to kneel down and grovel to this primitive witch-hunt.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Council has caved in. We refused to apologize&hellip;&#8221;<br>
Reminds me of the time I was walking past some bikers smoking Pot in the Flea Market parking lot. An elderly woman walked up and started to verbally chastize them. One biker laughed and said, &#8220;We hear ya knockin` Granny but ya can`t come in!&#8221;  There was nothing left for her to do but walk off red faced, smarting at the chuckles of the bystanders&hellip; The lesson I learned? The power of shame and name calling is fragile at best and needs only the non cooperation of the target to disssolve in impotence.</p>

<p>Yorkshireman. I hit the link, saw the opening page&hellip;and I just didn&rsquo;t, or wouldn&rsquo;t go further.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for the link on your post number 12 too, for additional information. If Mrs Farquar just couldn&rsquo;t be bothered anymore because of this rubbish, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame her. All that public service scuppered by an ingrate-alien.</p>
