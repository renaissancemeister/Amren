			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My Fox Tampa Bay, Feb. 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tampa mother is getting attention for some unconventional parenting.</p>
<p>Ronda Holder is forcing her 15-year-old son James Mond to stand on various Tampa street corners holding a sign detailing his bad grades.</p>
<p>Some cheer her approach as tough love; others question whether it&rsquo;s too much.</p>
<p>The sign says he only answered four questions on his FCAT and has a 1.222 GPA. The sign asks passersby to &#8220;honk if I need an education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until he straightens up his grades and gets his education on track, he&rsquo;s going to work this corner,&#8221; said Holder, with her son at Hillsborough Avenue and 22nd Street Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>James&rsquo; mother realizes her parenting is unorthodox, but says it&rsquo;s because she cares and doesn&rsquo;t want her son to become a dropout. She says James will be on the corner for one week.</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&rsquo;t like it and I&rsquo;m probably the baddest parent in the world right now, but he&rsquo;ll be okay,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In the long run, he&rsquo;ll thank me for it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is not the first black child subjected to this kind of humiliarion.  Bill Cosby&rsquo;s father did something similar.  He used to tell visitors, &#8220;Here!  I want you to look at my dumb kid!&#8221;  He said to his son, &#8220;Tell my friend how you smeared jello on the kitchen floor in order to trip the Chickenheart that ate New York City!&#8221;</p>

		<p>A better approach, practiced by other successful ethnic groups includes; talking to your kid, reading regularly to your kid, minimize TV, third party intervention like tutoring, establish discipline at home such as regular meal times, chores, rules of social courtesy.

		<p>I applaud this woman.  Most black single mothers couldn&rsquo;t tell you what grade their child is in, much less what kind of grades he gets.  She gets it.  She knows that dropping out will lead to arrests and finally either prison or death.  If only all black single mothers had the common sense she does.  On the other hand, I bet the people saying that it &#8220;might be too much&#8221; are probably white liberals.   </p>

<p>Sounds like a great idea. The truth is MOST blacks could pass k-12 and graduate, with some legitimate effort. School work has been so dumbed down, that a kid who could only get &#8220;d&rsquo;s&#8221; in the 60&rsquo;s could make the honor roll today. I have seen first hand through the last 4 decades, how simple schoolwork has been lowered to. All in a futile effort to close the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; between whites and minorities. </p>
<p>For a kid to only attempt to answer 4 questions on his FCAT, shows how much effort he is putting into his work. Perhaps this mother&rsquo;s efforts will keep her son from joining his brothas in prison and maybe he wont be a burden to society. Maybe.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Mond, he might not be the next Einstein, but from what I have read and seen, it seems to me that he&rsquo;s perfectly capable of getting better than a D+ average.  Especially in today&rsquo;s high schools, especially if his school is majority black.  Nowhere can I find the name of his school, and if we could find that out, we could easily find the race data of the student body.</p>

<p>I wonder how the kids mother did in school. Why isn&rsquo;t she taking the time to properly (help) educate her child. Why is it always up to the kid and school. Maybe the child has a learning disability (like a bad mother). I am guessing that they are both black, but that shouldn&rsquo;t matter. Humiliation does not build intelligence, it builds resentment. </p>

		<p>Oh man.  This mom has the right idea, she is trying to do the right thing.  More black moms could be like that.  But perhaps she could have done something before it got to this point, because a GPA wouldn&rsquo;t fall to that level overnight.</p>
<p>But how embarrassed do you think he will be?  This can only increase his standing with his homies  &mdash;  the same homies who are probably giving him &#8216;high fives&rsquo; as he stands on the corner with his sign. He&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; it real.</p>

		<p>She may be able to tell herself and her neighbors that she is trying to help the kid, but she is only making it worse.</p>
<p>What she needs to do is sit down with the kid on a day by day basis and make sure he does his homework and gets him to read ahead in the book for the next day&rsquo;s lesson, if applicable.</p>
<p>Maybe she even helps him with some Q&A; about the lessons.  </p>

		<p>James&rsquo; chances of getting an education would improve a lot more if his mother would keep him in school after hours for studying instead of lowering his confidence, self-esteen and morale by just standing on a street corner showing his failures&hellip;or most of all, his mothers failures more likely. </p>
<p>And Ronda, until he straightens up on his education and grades, perhaps you can sit with your own child that you want to succeed and prosper in his life, by supporting and being a help-guru or even just a simple mother&hellip;not a billboard advertiser!</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t need to be a dropout, because that&rsquo;s why we got a corrupt school system for minorites, right?</p>

I find this emotionally abusive and cruel if this boy doesn&rsquo;t have the IQ to do better in school.</p>
<p>Is it laziness or is he dumb? If he&rsquo;s simply naturally dumb he isn&rsquo;t responsible for his poor grades. We all know the average IQ of blacks so there&rsquo;s a good chance he could be on the far left side of the bell curve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see anyone, black or white, be humiliated because of their natural limits. I don&rsquo;t want to see blacks browbeaten for their innate failure. I just want them to acknowledge such and understand their limits (and to live as far away from me as possible).<br>

For goodness sakes, the mothr is obviously concerend for her son! As some other posters have commented from time to time, for the life of me, I cannot understand why some of you cannot applaud a Black person whenever they are doing something positive. It is as if, you are looking for excuses to bash them.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to venture if a Black or Hispanic doctor found a cure for cancer in the near future some of you would argue that he or she should have done so years earlier or it&rsquo;s only to cure a segment of the population or some sort of insane foolishness.</p>
<p>It is this sort of unjust and uncalled (and quite frankly bigoted, no race realist would utter such foolishness) for criticism that gives our critics ammunition toward us.  </p>
<p>Give it a rest guys!    <br>

		<p>Can the kid get a better GPA or is he maybe cognitively impaired?  Seems like he&rsquo;s obedient enough (to his mom anyway), he&rsquo;s standing on the corner with a sign at her direction.  And I doubt that this is the first time his mother has mentioned, and tried to correct, his academic problems   &mdash;   it seems to be a real concern of hers.  The fact is that some kids (especially Black male kids) just CAN&rsquo;T do well in school even if their mothers (and society) would like them to.</p>

		<p>As a one-time junior high teacher and daughter of an elementary teacher, I have to disagree with many of the comments concerning this story.  This boy may be a poor reader or even a non-reader(Mom may have printed the sign).  The whole affair may be a publicity stunt aimed at acquiring donations.<br>
One person or even the whole of American liberality cannot make those with low IQ&rsquo;s able to excel academically.  By their insistence that blacks, as a group, are no less intellectually gifted than whites, the left has probably caused more frustration and unhappiness in the black community than was  previously known.  Equal opportunity is all that can be realistically given to blacks.</p>

		<p>In Britain you could  have your children taken away and  put into  a home for such treatment. Though only if you were white.  Over here  some would call it &#8216;child abuse&rsquo;. <br>
In any case I would say it could prove a rather dangerous approach; especially for those with a pathological make up. <br>
Such kids later arm themselves and shoot up the school. </p>

		<p>One of the first signs of innate intelligence is persistent curiosity about the environment.  Look at the face of that young man and tell me that that isn&rsquo;t the face of someone tired of only being held up when he fails to meet spec on another report card.  To the point where the only thing he has left is total dissociation from his present situation.</p>
<p>Now look at the presented expression of the stubborn, proud, _dominant_ mother.  Who takes such pleasure in her potent control over her male sons perceptions of the situation but has no concern whatsoever as to why he is the way he is-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&#8220;You take the phone. You take things from them&hellip; It don&rsquo;t work,&#8221; Holder told Fox 13 News in Tampa Bay. &#8220;So embarrassing is the best thing. He don&rsquo;t like to get embarrassed.&#8221;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>If he has a phone and can use it and you take it away from him because he won&rsquo;t study math and science which he -doesn&rsquo;t- &#8216;get&rsquo;, how cruel do you suppose it seems to him to be removing the one thing he can make work for the many he can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>In this, probably as a result of her own cognitive failure, she doesn&rsquo;t understand that what he doesn&rsquo;t like is being made to feel even dumber and more behind than he already is.  THAT is the embarrassment here.  Standing on the street corner like a homeless person asking for work only reinforces that issue.</p>
<p>And every car that drives by _without honking_?</p>
<p>Furthers his understanding of himself.</p>
<p>Couple Genetic Facts here people:</p>
<p>1.  There are those who are born workers that do a job they are told to, well, with a given amount of oversight and take pride in the fact that those whom they know are smarter than they are still want them to do that job.  There are those who supervise the first type in the execution of more complex tasks.  And there are those who create or formularize the policies and processes by which those tasks are done.</p>
<p>We have just about created a society where the first kind of person has no future, as robotics come online to replace labor outright rather than pay it a dollar a day, that reality will become ever more explicit.  Which doesn&rsquo;t mean we should torture those not gifted by enforcing a blatantly misrepresented egalitarian standard as a false attemt to &#8216;close the gap&rsquo; of unraiseable standards.  Until the victims break into criminal fury or apathetic sociopathy.</p>
<p>2.  If you have a couple, no matter what their IQ, the chances are that their kids are going to be somewhere between their average intelligence and the population average.  After 40+ years of genetics studies we still don&rsquo;t even have a public -guess- as to why.  Which tells you where the science of race realism really is at: still in the 70s.</p>
<p>This blatant ignorance of simple facts not told to expectant parents is a tragedy for the highly intelligent who don&rsquo;t understand why their children don&rsquo;t perform at their level and so see their SES continuance vanish before their eyes.</p>
<p>It is flat out _dangerous_ for those of lower intelligence because an average IQ of 74 between the mother and father in a population average of 87 still only results in an IQ of 83 for the son.  Subtract another two points for every sibling whose care mom must divide her attention between and/or 10,000 dollars under a given SES norm of &#8216;privilege&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Which sets up the real farce of the article-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The hair stylist and niece of a former Tampa Bay police chief didn&rsquo;t finish high school herself, and neither did the teen&rsquo;s father, James Mond Jr.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not the occasional bright bulb in the group that sets their potential.  It&rsquo;s _the group_, as an average.  And no amount of &#8216;noteworthy individuals in the family tree&rsquo; as apologia can change this as an attempt to avoid acknowledging statistical genetics.</p>
<p>Rather than avoid the issue, how about we stop with dreamworld Liberalism as social guilt and try pragmatic Race Realism instead?  Get the kid into something he can enjoy, either for itself or for the rewards it gives.  Teach him about responsible sex and reward him, with straight up payouts not job entitlements beyond his abilities, for having few kids of his own.</p>
<p>While making sure that we start a program of applied genetics to improve the human species as a whole so that we don&rsquo;t keep expanding the &#8216;persistent curiosity deficit&rsquo; problem through James Mond IV.</p>
<p>I personally have no care whether blacks improve or not but for their reproductive rates and transfer payment drain upon white society.  But if we are going to play Archimedes and lever up the planet, let&rsquo;s do it the right way, like we intend to solve the problem.  As smart people.</p>
<p>I am so tired of seeing an endless process of treating the symptoms as an enablement industry, not curing the shortfall as a long term gift to -our- children.</p>
<p>Who could also benefit from an intelligence increase.</p>

		<p>Why bother, I ask? Some people just aren&rsquo;t cut out for &#8220;brain work&#8221;, and such people are more common in the black population than the white population. You&rsquo;ll just make him into an angry young man, who will then proceed to express his anger by beating hell out of a white person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the genius in this story, who is getting an F in gym&#8221;<br>
How in hell does anyone get an F in gym? I was a sickly child, and I got a B in gym consistently. You basically have to ignore the instructor, or engage in disciplinary infractions to fail that class. Oh, wait&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally, shame might work on a white child (I was mortified when I was nine and my parents mentioned my &#8220;C&#8221; grade in math to my relatives), but black males have the most overinflated egos of any group on the planet. Trying to shame them is like trying to smash a boulder with a wiffle bat.</p>

		<p>While I find this a bizarre form of pusnishment, I&rsquo;ll grant at least she is showing concern about his schooling   &mdash;   which is more than many other black parents do.</p>
<p>But what is this boy&rsquo;s IQ?  Does he have learning difficulties? Dislexia?  No amount of humiliation is going to change basic deficiencies.</p>
<p>If the mother had more intelligence herself, rather than emotionally abusing her child in this way, would it  not make more sense to SIT HIM DOWN at home and SEE TO IT that he spends more time on  his  homework, rather than wasting  time standing on a street corner which will accomplish nothing but to make him resentful and bitter?</p>
<p>This way, she&rsquo;s not educating him;   all she&rsquo;s doing is producing an angry member of society.  You cannot shame people into getting better grades, if they don&rsquo;t have what it takes.<br>
