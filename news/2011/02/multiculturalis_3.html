<h1>Multiculturalism &#8216;Clearly&rsquo; a Failure: Sarkozy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Post (Toronto), February 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared Thursday that multiculturalism had failed, joining a growing number of world leaders or former leaders who have condemned it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My answer is clearly yes, it is a failure,&#8221; he said in a television interview when asked about the policy which advocates that host societies welcome and foster distinct cultural and religious immigrant groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we must all respect differences, but we do not want .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a society where communities coexist side by side. If you come to France, you accept to melt into a single community, which is the national community, and if you do not want to accept that, you cannot be welcome in France,&#8221; the right-wing president said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The French national community cannot accept a change in its lifestyle, equality between men and women .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. freedom for little girls to go to school,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been too concerned about the identity of the person who was arriving and not enough about the identity of the country that was receiving him,&#8221; Mr. Sarkozy said in the TFI channel show.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Australia&rsquo;s ex-prime minister John Howard and Spanish ex-premier Jose Maria Aznar have also recently said multicultural policies have not successfully integrated immigrants.</p>
<p>Ms. Merkel in October said efforts towards multiculturalism in Germany had &#8220;failed, totally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comment followed weeks of anguished debate sparked by the huge popularity of a book by a central banker saying that immigrants, in particular Muslims, were making Germany &#8220;more stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Mr. Cameron last week pronounced his country&rsquo;s long-standing policy of multiculturalism a failure, calling for better integration of young Muslims to combat home-grown extremism.</p>
<p>He urged a &#8220;more active, muscular liberalism&#8221; where equal rights, the rule of law, freedom of speech and democracy are actively promoted to create a stronger national identity.</p>
<p>The prime minister, who took power in May 2010, argued that &#8220;under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and the mainstream.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this had resulted in a lack of national identity in Britain which had made some young Muslims turn to extremist ideology.</p>
<p>Mr. Sarkozy said in his television interview Thursday that &#8220;our Muslim compatriots must be able to practise their religion, as any citizen can,&#8221; but he noted &#8220;we in France do not want people to pray in an ostentatious way in the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen late last year came under fire for comparing Muslims praying in the streets outside overcrowded mosques in France to the Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen said there were &#8220;10 to 15&#8221; places in France where Muslims worshipped in the streets outside mosques when these were full.<br>

		<p>Too little, too late.  Different cultural groups, even if they share the same religion, do not mix.  The Bosnians, Serbians and Croats are indistinguisable from each other, but due to language and religion they live seperate lives.  Iraqi Arabs are all the same whether shia, sunni or christian.  Yet the fight like maniacs.</p>
<p>France accepted north africa in its midst.  That part of France is lost.  Alas, Joan of Arc, France was conquered!</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything here about halting immigration, let alone reversing it.  All these so-called &#8220;right-wing&#8221; politicians appear to be saying is that &#8220;we&#8221; (meaning White people, of course) need to do more to entice foreigners to be nice and fit in with their host countries.</p>
<p>That, of course, isn&rsquo;t going to happen, because the cause of the problem is genetic, not political or social.  I suppose it&rsquo;s a good thing that the topic is being raised in public at all, but these politicos are still delicately tiptoeing around the core issue.</p>
<p>PS: What is &#8220;muscular liberalism?&#8221;  Is that something like warm cold, or sunny night or flooded drought?<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled.  All these (fake) European leaders will go back to the drawing board to try and figure out a way to force miscegenation, which is really their goal.  They all need to be ousted immediately and sent to the country where most of their cottled immigrants came from.<br>

		<p>These governments have foisted foreigners on a native population who did not want it for decades. They&rsquo;ve allowed foreigners to invade and colonize while demonizing any who protest. And, now, that the truth of it can be hidden no longer they up the ante by demanding that those same put upon natives assimilate their invaders rather than repatriating them. The fraud and treachery of these traitors should be evident by one single fact this article quietly omits   &mdash;   that those same leaders who now admit multiculturalism is a failure still refuse to stop the flood of invaders.</p>

		<p>This is, to an extent, good news.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not stating that Sarkozy is at all a crusader for European heritage, nor am I stating that he is shifting his attitudes or anything. Quite likely, this &#8220;multiculturalism has failed&#8221; comment is a political ploy to woo over supporters of the National Front ahead of the 2012 presidential elections. God knows he will desperately need their support in order to win the election.</p>
<p>But this is good news, because, as highduke (Post #1) mentioned, it represents the slow shift of the paradigm back to normality. Just like Cultural Marxism imposed itself ever so slowly and incrementally in Western civilization, so can nationalism. This admission of the failure of multiculturalism in effect shows that our ideas are gaining wider acceptance.</p>
<p>The road is a long one still, but I think we are moving in a positive direction.</p>

Obongo is correct.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about ending 3rd world immigration or sending the lot to their homeland. It&rsquo;s about whites being asked to TRY HARDER to MAKE multiCULTurlaims work because &#8216;it&rsquo;s OUR fault, after all. White people aren&rsquo;t doing enough to make these people become French, or German, or American. WE have failed multiCULTuralism&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Progress. That dim-witted western leaders can bring themselves to say ethat multiculturalism has failed IS progress.  A few years ago, Brenda Walker, an acerbic blogger for VDARE.com, could accurately observe: </p>
<p>&#8220;These days, no American holiday celebration is complete without major fawning about diversity.&#8221; (Brenda Walker, VDARE.com, Nov. 25, 2008)</p>
<p>There is less fawning today. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>More of Walker on multiculturalism:</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity and its political twin multiculturalism are the latest in history&rsquo;s march of wrong and stupid ideologies, following Fascism and Communism in the last century.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;We can have multiculturalism or we can have women&rsquo;s rights and safety &mdash; not both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have in the West is worth defending, and we must. A future where traditional freedoms are destroyed is too awful to contemplate.&#8221;*<br>

		<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism &lsquo;Clearly&rsquo; a Failure: Sarkozy&#8221;</p>
<p>That these elitist promotors of multiculturalism weren&rsquo;t aware of the vast problems inherent in ALL &#8220;diverse&#8221; societies before embarking on their plan for third world inundation, is a silent testament to their lack of any real intelligence and their unawareness of what the real world is all about.  </p>
<p>After years of failure, and seeing first hand that people want to be with their own kind and adhere to their own language, customs and traditions, some of them now understand what a mistake it was opting for diversity in the first place. But far too many still don&rsquo;t get it and never will even if their society erupts into racial/ethnic conflict all around them. </p>
<p>The people on the right they loved to condemn as racists for warning of the vast problems and dangers of creating non-homogeneous societies knew full well in the beginning the plan was insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unravelling now and will continue to get worse no matter what steps these leftist radicals take to try to make their societies work.</p>

		<p>These liberal and neo-conservatives are simply re-calibrating their strategy, the final aim of which is the mongrelization of Europe and the White Race as a whole.  </p>
<p>The only acceptable solution should be the repatriation of immigrants back to where they came from, back to where they belong.  </p>

<p>I told him do you realize over 600,000 whites died in the Civil War so that you could be free?</p>
<p>Do you realize No One dislikes you because of your Color, whites lay in the sun to darken their skin, the reason people feel the way they do about you isn&rsquo;t because of COLOR, it is because of BEHAVIOURS.</p>

<p>I agree with you but it would be very foolish to think these steps don&rsquo;t &#8216;work&rsquo;. So far it&rsquo;s been about affirmative-action for people of color (because whites are discriminating) and condemning all whites as evil but also white racial activism. So far it&rsquo;s prevented a revolution and even a populist uprising or political movement of the kind that could have prevented whites from taking the path that they are on now, the road towards extinction in this new world. Ultimately their efforts will fail in North America, or at the very least it looks likely whites will have their own country in the Pacific Northwest. Wishful thinking? Perhaps, but personally I&rsquo;m guessing such a &#8216;hateful&rsquo; place is the most likely resting point for their &#8216;diversity&rsquo; train. </p>

		<p>I would agree this is nothing more than pre-election sabre rattling.  Sarkozy&rsquo;s first campaign ran on an anti-immigrant platform for the sole purpose of taking the steam out of the Front National.  All the French got for their trouble was anti-White discrimination laws, affirmative action and government compelled miscegenation.  Sarkozy is an immigrant himself and given his alien origins, he&rsquo;s not even European or French any more than Trevor Howard is British.</p>

		<p>Hopefully this is the start of something.  Once the right-wing leaders of Europe realize that these immigrants cannot be successfully integrated, they will have to oppose immigration as a whole.  Sarkozy even said that, &#8220;&hellip; if you do not want to accept [integration], you cannot be welcome in France.&#8221;  The overwhelming majority of immigrants in Europe will never integrate.  They will stubbornly refuse assimilation, and then the only thing left to do is deport them.</p>

&ldquo;My answer is clearly yes, it is a failure,&rdquo; he said in a television interview when asked about the policy which advocates that host societies welcome and foster distinct cultural and religious immigrant groups.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Then admit that IQ is tied to genetics.  Admit that cultural memes (low criminality, high cohesion, progressive work ethics, high aesthetics, low psychoses, commonizeable goals) are expressions of IQ.  Show that &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; (endogamy as homogenic phenotype preferrence) is simply the instinctive acknowledgement that _with certain external morphologic characteristics go certain internal behaviors_.</p>
<p>Something which _every_ species has had, long before science proved it.  And a behavior whose genetic conservatency of the external as the internal &#8216;is a really good idea&rsquo;.  For us.</p>
<p>Essentially admit that the reason why modern society looks like it does (97% of cultural achievements attributable to white males) is because whites have selected for certain fitness traits in our specific environments that are setting us up to evolve into a separate species.</p>
<p>Separate and not equal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;Of course we must all respect differences, but we do not want &hellip; a society where communities coexist side by side. If you come to France, you accept to melt into a single community, which is the national community, and if you do not want to accept that, you cannot be welcome in France,&rdquo; the right-wing president said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Then you clearly do not understand what &#8216;diversity&rsquo; means.</p>
<p>Because diversity is achieved in _geographic isolates_ where genes are given the chance to condense homogeny to new variation in genetic norms.  Including the unique cultural memes which express our &#8216;way of doing things&rsquo;.  Better than anyone else.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism leads to muddy cosmopolitanism as cultural flatlining because memetic values brought too close, spatially, among different _cultural inheritances_ Retards Excellence by competing resources between divergent groups until the group which pioneered the effect loses all value in it to the one which exists as exogamic parasites.</p>
<p>Darwin says so.  Spearman, Watson, Lynn, Murray, Jensen, all agree with him, via different, validated, statistical, models.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the above and we will wake up to the fact that human evolution is not coincident but tangential.  Our maximums are peaked differently.  And we are ultimately divergent.</p>
<p>Fail to do this, and what WE ALL AGREE (Nike or Playstation, Mozart or Renoir) is &#8216;best of what makes us human&rsquo; _will fade to nothing_.  Because other cultures cannot sustain for themselves what they enjoy of our lifestyle.  And we cannot sustain ourselves and them as cooccupants of the same terrain isolate as environmental niche.</p>
<p>Not At All.</p>

		<p>Someone feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but isn&rsquo;t this the very same Nicholas Sarkozy who on at least two well documented and well publicized (in white nationalist circles)occasions,  basically ordered his native White French to race mix, &#8216;or else&rsquo;, with the hordes of Africans and other non-white Muslims that white genocide craving bigots like him have been deliberately importing into these White majority nations?    </p>

<p>Getbackjack is dead on the money.   And, to his observation, allow me to add this one.   Since it is now apparent that these anti-white, hate consumed ruling elites have decided to synchronize their new message - while publicly making statements that seem to show an acceptance that these multi-culturalizing schemes have been a failure, these elites will continue to keep importing thousands of these non-whites and then switching their agenda to cooking up ways to steal more of the white tax payers money to fund various new programs that claim to focus on integrating these non-whites into the host culture, none of which will work – but they will buy more time for these evil elites and their stooges to complete their white genocide program.</p>
<p>And, as always, when whites are deprived of greater and greater portions of their income, they respond by having fewer and fewer children – because they can&rsquo;t afford them.</p>
<p>Here is the real solution:   Arrests, genocide charges applied, genocide trials held, followed by swift convictions and even swifter public executions of every ruling elite who has had a role in the promotion of White European genocide.    </p>
<p>Followed, of course, by the election of a legitimate and honest European Nationalist government, who should immediately pass laws that classify any and all promotion of &#8216;Cultural Marxism&rsquo; to be a crime of treason, punishable by death.</p>

		<p>The ongoing attempt to give the appearance that multiculturalism is a &#8220;failure&#8221; is merely an attempt by the ruling cliques in the various entities of the EU to throw sand in the eyes of their disconcerted populations.

<p>Concerning the ever-evolving strategies of the globalists, though, I would say that while it is right for savvy WN´s to caution against underestimating them I also feel that in some sense we are overestimating them as well. I&rsquo;m not sure they are all on the same page tactically and the furious backpeddling going on might also suggest that they themselves were overconfident and actually surprised at the reaction. For Cameron and Sarkozy I am almost sure of this. Perhaps Merkel as well but I sense that maybe she might really be coming to a revelation. Of course I could be wrong (but the one guy I think might have meant it was the first of the major European leaders to say something. Berlusconi did say &#8220;Italy is not a multi-ethnic society&#8221; and of coarse was vilified and ignored. Now these other bums step in).</p>
<p>Just look at how the Obama team bungled the Egypt situation. Biden and the special envoy Wisner saying one thing and Obama and Hillary another. I&rsquo;d like to opine that even the smartest, most disciplined leftists have serious emotional problems and when your talking about the whole bunch, including all the mediocrities, any conspiracy is bound to unravel if some real pressure is put on them and things spiral off script (e.g. you could look at Bernanke&rsquo;s forced actions re QE2, trying to keep the Greenspan bubble afloat but with diminishing returns. And that&rsquo;s my point. Why do so many assume these guys are all evil geniuses?).</p>
<p>What I see among regular white people really is an awakening. One of the smaller tipping points was when Omar Thornton killed those white guys in CT and the whole media tried the Colin Ferguson racism defense. Nobody was buying it and I overheard frequently (never mind the people I talked to) conversations where even liberal seeming people were angry about what they were being fed. Another OJ moment and I do believe these are cumulative. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pressure that&rsquo;s building and I&rsquo;m not sure these guys got an answer to it. Is their support from their respective militaries or police so strong that they could order a third-world type crackdown on dissent when push comes to shove? And I&rsquo;m not talking about the generalized PC repression that&rsquo;s been going on. I mean the real thing. I don&rsquo;t see it but if someone here knows better please tell us how it can come about.<br>
Just from talking to the cops that I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem that it would go off as well as they would like it to.</p>
<p>Anything can happen at this point but I do think the momentum is definitely going our way more and more. Good hunting to all of us.</p>

		<p>Sarkosy isn&rsquo;t suggesting that multiculturalism should be abandoned as a method of creating a one world cultural Marxist state.</p>
<p>Pay attention to what he is saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;We have been too concerned about the identity of the person who was arriving (immigrants)and not enough about the identity of the country that was receiving him,&rdquo;(the French) Mr. Sarkozy said</p>
<p>This means that the cultural Marxists are going to apply cultural Marxist theory more stringently. The French will be expected to forgo their national identity.  </p>

Obongo is correct.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about ending 3rd world immigration or sending the lot to their homeland. It&rsquo;s about whites being asked to TRY HARDER to MAKE multiCULTurlaims work because &lsquo;it&rsquo;s OUR fault, after all. White people aren&rsquo;t doing enough to make these people become French, or German, or American. WE have failed multiCULTuralism&rsquo;.<br>

This is a move in the right direction. Until recently it was taboo to acknowledge that efforts to achieve diversity had any costs at all. Once national leaders state what is obviously true it will be more difficult to suppress an honest discussion of the problems created by admitting immigrant groups who will not or cannot conform to Western standards of civilization and decency.  </p>

		<p>The goal of multiculturism was never to &#8220;work,&#8221; at least not in the sense one might take that to mean. Sociologically, biologically, and culturally it could never work, despite governments&rsquo; best efforts to hoodwink us into believing how marvelous multiculturism would be for us.  </p>
<p>Rather, the goal of multiculturism was to displace Whites as quickly as possible, creating forever a massive class of dependent, third world parasites that would bow at the feet of their leaders which sacrificed so much for them.</p>
<p>So what Sarkozy really means when he says multiculturism is &#8220;not working&#8221; is that it&rsquo;s not working fast enough for his liking! Words without affirmative steps to stop this genocidal practice are nothing but that, hollow words with no substance.</p>

		<p>Anon #19: &#8220;&hellip;other cultures cannot sustain for themselves what they enjoy of our lifestyle. And we cannot sustain ourselves and them as cooccupants of the same terrain isolate as environmental niche. Not At All.&#8221;</p>
<p>In different words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consciousness of kind is widespread.  In his Guide to the Panorama of North American&rsquo;Mammals, University of Kansas biology professor Raymond Hall summarized a law of nature: &lsquo;Two subspecies of the same species do not occur in the same geographic area.&rsquo; One will inevitably eliminate or displace the other.  And Professor Hall included humans in this rule: &lsquo;To imagine one subspecies of man living together on equal terms for long with another subspecies is wishful thinking and leads only to disaster or oblivion for one or the other.&rsquo;&rdquo;*</p>

		<p>Its not &#8216;Multiculturalism&rsquo; which is a a failure but &#8216;MULTIRACIALISM&rsquo; itself. Europe has gotta become 99.99% Genetically European or White if one wants to prevent it from becoming a failure.</p>
