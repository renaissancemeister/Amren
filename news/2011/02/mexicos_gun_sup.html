<h1><a href="https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110209-mexicos-gun-supply-and-90-percent-myth">Mexico&rsquo;s Gun Supply and the 90 Percent Myth</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Stewart, Stratfor, February 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For several years now, STRATFOR has been closely watching developments in Mexico that relate to what we consider the three wars being waged there. Those three wars are the war between the various drug cartels, the war between the government and the cartels, and the war being waged against citizens and businesses by criminals.</p>
<p>{snip} According to the Mexican government, the cartel wars are not a result of corruption in Mexico or of economic and societal dynamics that leave many Mexicans marginalized and desperate to find a way to make a living. Instead, the cartel wars are due to the insatiable American appetite for narcotics and the endless stream of guns that flows from the United States into Mexico and that results in Mexican violence.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the part of this argument pertaining to guns has been adopted by many politicians and government officials in the United States in recent years. It has now become quite common to hear U.S. officials confidently assert that 90 percent of the weapons used by the Mexican drug cartels come from the United States. However, a close examination of the dynamics of the cartel wars in Mexico  &mdash;  and of how the oft-echoed 90 percent number was reached  &mdash;  clearly demonstrates that the number is more political rhetoric than empirical fact.</p>
<p><b>By the Numbers</b></p>
<p>As we discussed in a previous analysis, the 90 percent number was derived from a June 2009 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report to Congress on U.S. efforts to combat arms trafficking to Mexico (see external link).</p>
<p>According to the GAO report, some 30,000 firearms were seized from criminals by Mexican authorities in 2008. Of these 30,000 firearms, information pertaining to 7,200 of them (24 percent) was submitted to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) for tracing. Of these 7,200 guns, only about 4,000 could be traced by the ATF, and of these 4,000, some 3,480 (87 percent) were shown to have come from the United States.</p>
<p>This means that the 87 percent figure relates to the number of weapons submitted by the Mexican government to the ATF that could be successfully traced and not from the total number of weapons seized by Mexican authorities or even from the total number of weapons submitted to the ATF for tracing. In fact, the 3,480 guns positively traced to the United States equals less than 12 percent of the total arms seized in Mexico in 2008 and less than 48 percent of all those submitted by the Mexican government to the ATF for tracing. This means that almost 90 percent of the guns seized in Mexico in 2008 were <em>not</em> traced back to the United States.</p>
<p>The remaining 22,800 firearms seized by Mexican authorities in 2008 were not traced for a variety of reasons. In addition to factors such as bureaucratic barriers and negligence, many of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities either do not bear serial numbers or have had their serial numbers altered or obliterated. It is also important to understand that the Mexican authorities simply don&rsquo;t bother to submit some classes of weapons to the ATF for tracing. Such weapons include firearms they identify as coming from their own military or police forces, or guns that they can trace back themselves as being sold through the Mexican Defense Department&rsquo;s Arms and Ammunition Marketing Division (UCAM). Likewise, they do not ask ATF to trace military ordnance from third countries like the South Korean fragmentation grenades commonly used in cartel attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, some or even many of the 22,800 firearms the Mexicans did not submit to ATF for tracing may have originated in the United States. But according to the figures presented by the GAO, there is no evidence to support the assertion that 90 percent of the guns used by the Mexican cartels come from the United States  &mdash;  especially when not even 50 percent of those that were submitted for tracing were ultimately found to be of U.S. origin. </p>
<p>This point leads us to consider the types of weapons being used by the Mexican cartels and where they come from.</p>
<p><b>Types and Sources of Guns</b></p>
<p>To gain an understanding of the dynamics of the gun flow inside Mexico, it helps if one divides the guns seized by Mexican authorities from criminals into three broad categories  &mdash;  which, incidentally, just happen to represent three different sources. </p>
<p>Type 1: Guns Legally Available in Mexico</p>
<p>The first category of weapons encountered in Mexico is weapons available legally for sale in Mexico through UCAM. These include handguns smaller than a .357 magnum such as .380 and .38 Special.</p>
<p>A large portion of this first type of guns used by criminals is purchased in Mexico, or stolen from their legitimate owners. While UCAM does have very strict regulations for civilians to purchase guns, criminals will use straw purchasers to obtain firearms from UCAM or obtain them from corrupt officials. Cartel hit men in Mexico commonly use .380 pistols equipped with sound suppressors in their assassinations. In many cases, these pistols are purchased in Mexico, the suppressors are locally manufactured and the guns are adapted to receive the suppressors by Mexican gunsmiths. </p>
<p>It must be noted, though, that because of the cost and hassle of purchasing guns in Mexico, many of the guns in this category are purchased in the United States and smuggled into the country. There are a lot of cheap guns available on the U.S. market, and they can be sold at a premium in Mexico. Indeed, guns in this category, such as .380 pistols and .22-caliber rifles and pistols, are among the guns most commonly traced back to the United States. Still, the numbers do not indicate that 90 percent of guns in this category come from the United States. </p>
<p>Additionally, most of the explosives the cartels have been using in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Mexico over the past year have used commercially available Tovex, so we consider these explosives to fall in this first category. Mexican IEDs are another area where the rhetoric has been interesting to analyze, but we will explore this topic another time. </p>
<p>Type 2: Guns Legally Available in the U.S. but Not in Mexico</p>
<p>Many popular handgun calibers, such as 9 mm, .45 and .40, are reserved for the military and police and are not available for sale to civilians in Mexico. These guns, which are legally sold and very popular in the United States, comprise our second category, which also includes .50-caliber rifles, semiautomatic versions of assault rifles like the AK-47 and M16 and the FN Five-Seven pistol. </p>
<p>When we consider this second type of guns, a large number of them encountered in Mexico are likely purchased in the United States. Indeed, the GAO report notes that many of the guns most commonly traced back to the United States fall into this category. There are also many .45-caliber and 9 mm semiautomatic pistols and .357 revolvers obtained from deserters from the Mexican military and police, purchased from corrupt Mexican authorities or even brought in from South America (guns made by manufacturers such as Taurus and Bersa). This category also includes semiautomatic variants of assault rifles and main battle rifles, which are often converted by Mexican gunsmiths to be capable of fully automatic fire.</p>
<p>One can buy these types of weapons on the international arms market, but one pays a premium for such guns and it is cheaper and easier to simply buy them in the United States or South America and smuggle them into Mexico. In fact, there is an entire cottage industry that has developed to smuggle such weapons, and not all the customers are cartel hit men. There are many Mexican citizens who own guns in calibers such as .45, 9 mm, .40 and .44 magnum for self-defense  &mdash;  even though such guns are illegal in Mexico.</p>
<p>Type 3: Guns Not Available for Civilian Purchase in Mexico or the U.S.</p>
<p>The third category of weapons encountered in Mexico is military-grade ordnance not generally available for sale in the United States or Mexico. This category includes hand grenades, 40 mm grenades, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), automatic assault rifles and main battle rifles and light machine guns.</p>
<p>This third type of weapon is fairly difficult and very expensive to obtain in the United States, especially in the large numbers in which the cartels are employing them. They are also dangerous to obtain in the United States due to heavy law enforcement scrutiny. Therefore, most of the military ordnance used by the Mexican cartels comes from other sources, such as the international arms market  &mdash;  increasingly from China via the same networks that furnish precursor chemicals for narcotics manufacturing  &mdash;  or from corrupt elements in the Mexican military or even deserters who take their weapons with them. Besides, items such as South Korean fragmentation grenades and RPG-7s, often used by the cartels, simply are not in the U.S. arsenal. This means that very few of the weapons in this category come from the United States.</p>
<p>In recent years the cartels, especially their enforcer groups such as Los Zetas, Gente Nueva and La Linea, have been increasingly using military weaponry instead of sporting arms. A close examination of the arms seized from the enforcer groups and their training camps clearly demonstrates this trend toward military ordnance, including many weapons not readily available in the United States. Some of these seizures have included M60 machine guns and hundreds of 40 mm grenades obtained from the military arsenals of countries like Guatemala. </p>
<p>But Guatemala is not the only source of such weapons. Latin America is awash in weapons that were shipped there over the past several decades to supply the various insurgencies and counterinsurgencies in the region. When these military-grade weapons are combined with the rampant corruption in the region, they quickly find their way into the black arms market. The Mexican cartels have supply-chain contacts that help move narcotics to Mexico from South America, and they are able to use this same network to obtain guns from the black market in South and Central America and then smuggle them into Mexico. While there are many weapons in this category that were manufactured in the United States, the overwhelming majority of the U.S.-manufactured weapons of this third type encountered in Mexico  &mdash;  like LAW rockets and M60 machine guns  &mdash;  come into Mexico from third countries and not directly from the United States.</p>
<p>There are also some cases of overlap between classes of weapons. For example, the FN Five-Seven pistol is available for commercial purchase in the United States, but the 5.7x28 armor-piercing ammunition for the pistol favored by the cartels is not  &mdash;  it is a restricted item. However, some of the special operations forces units in the Mexican military are issued the Five-Seven as well as the FN P90 personal defense weapon, which also shoots the 5.7x28 round, and the cartels are obtaining some of these weapons and the armor-piercing ammunition from them and not from the United States. Conversely, we see bulk 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm ammunition bought in the United States and smuggled into Mexico, where it is used in fully automatic AK-47s and M16s purchased elsewhere. As noted above, China has become an increasingly common source for military weapons like grenades and fully automatic assault rifles in recent years.</p>
<p>To really understand Mexico&rsquo;s gun problem, however, it is necessary to recognize that the same economic law of supply and demand that fuels drug smuggling into the United States also fuels gun smuggling into Mexico. Black market guns in Mexico can fetch up to 300 percent of their normal purchase price  &mdash;  a profit margin rivaling the narcotics the cartels sell. Even if it were somehow possible to hermetically seal the U.S.-Mexico border and shut off all the guns coming from the United States, the cartels would still be able to obtain weapons elsewhere  &mdash;  just as narcotics would continue to flow into the United States from other places. The United States does provide cheap and easy access to certain types of weapons and ammunition, but as demonstrated by groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, weapons can be easily obtained from other sources via the black arms market  &mdash;  albeit at a higher price. </p>
<p>There has clearly been a long and well-documented history of arms smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border, but it is important to recognize that, while the United States is a significant source of certain classes of weapons and ammunition, it is by no means the source of 90 percent of the weapons used by the Mexican cartels, as is commonly asserted.<br>

		<p>We buy the drugs so the Mexican government blames us for the behavior of their drug cartels. They get some weapons from the USA so they also blame us for that even though they are the buyers in that instance. Mexico is notorious as a totally crooked country where  the supposed law enforcement authorities are often also the criminals, presidents amass huge amounts of unexplained money, and so on. If you&rsquo;ve got the money anything or anyone can be bought there. For them to complain about any other country is laughable.       </p>

		<p>That the politicians in the US  &mdash;  -like Hillary Clinton  &mdash;  - are unaware that the vast majority of arms and armaments come from outside the US is no surprise, considering how out of touch with everything else they are.</p>
<p>However, the same information available to Stratfor is available to researchers within this present administration and to staffers for those in Congress, so there&rsquo;s no excuse for them to be agreeing the US is a major supplier of arms to Mexico.</p>
<p>Although the above article definitively breaks down the sources of arms, ammo and other weapons better than any other I&rsquo;ve read, Stratfor isn&rsquo;t the only source writing about the arms supply situation.  The information is available from several other sources also, which makes it even more inexcusable for US politicians to be ignorant of the situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Mexicans are delighted to be able to point their fingers at us for something in order to take some of the heat off themelves somewhat for failing to halt the flow of narcotics through their country.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m equally certain the leftist gun grabbers here are delighted to accept these bogus Mexican charges, hoping to use the false information to control guns somehow.</p>

		<p>I look at this as just a precursor (incident) excuse to create some kind of &#8216;cross border gun control&rsquo; along the lines of irreduceable size metrics, specific radiotag coaatings or in-barrel tag signatures that cannot be drilled out.  Any of whose &#8216;end user certificate&rsquo; violations will bring down ten different kinds of BATF hassle to U.S. gun manufacturers/dealers via civil suit and active prosecution.</p>
<p>This will virtually shut down gun manufacture/distribution to legitimate civillians in the States, something the liberal socialists have been seeking for a long time.</p>
<p>And set up &#8216;the next step&rsquo; in NAU justification as a function of a major cross-border terrorist attack along the lines of Pancho Villa.  &#8216;With our own guns against us&rsquo;.</p>
<p>IEDs are &#8216;more than just interesting&rsquo; in this case because a proficiency in explosives would allow Hispanic Looking Arabs (or vice versa) to create significant if not crippling damage to infrastructure at many places, simultaneously, with low risk.</p>
<p>Simply by blowing up underdefended electrical and water supply infrastructure.  People have _no idea_ how much copper and aluminum and even silver is invested in our major rectification grid, just in the neighborhood transformer pads.</p>
<p>And how much it would cost to replace slagged units without hurting a single living person.</p>
<p>Either way, sealing the border to let the inmates slaughter their way through the asylum can only be considered a &#8216;socially responsible&rsquo; thing to do.  Because drugs have no place in a society of dependent on intelligence and responsible, reliable, work ethic.  And while we may not send the guns, our coke, heroine and marijuana habits certainly supply the cash to buy them.</p>
<p>Wherever she gets the weapons to commit national suicide, better that Mexico should melt down or save herself without us to blame.</p>
<p>And if it keeps illegals on their side of the fence?</p>
<p>Hey, win-win.</p>

		<p>Even the relatively few American guns that wind up in Mexican drug gang hands might be overstated.  Last week, the scandal broke that the ATF was deliberately letting American guns get into Mexico.  The official ATF excuse was that it was the equivalent of drinking deuterium water   &mdash;   They wanted to identify bad guys based on where the guns went.  Problem is, the ATF has no jurisdiction in Mexico.</p>
<p>The real story is that the Obama White House is ordering the ATF to flood Mexico with guns in order to &#8220;create&#8221; the &#8220;problem&#8221; of &#8220;American guns in Mexico&#8221; in order to create the &#8220;need&#8221; for a &#8220;solution,&#8221; i.e. more gun control domestically.</p>

		<p>I work at a big apartment complex owned by a company in Chicago. Last summer, the company decided to do major remodeling. Since the owners were from Chicago, all the plumbers, electricians, and carpenters were also from that city. It took three months for the remodeling to be complete. As a result, I got to know the workers real well. The electricians were all brothers who were raised in America. Only one could remember anything to do with Mexico. When talking about politics, they showed how they blamed America for Mexico&rsquo;s problems. The gun thing was mentioned a couple of times. Man, I wish I had this information back then. Funny thing though, the white Eastern Europeans who barley spoke English and were not nearly as assimilated as the hispanic electricians who were raised here, showed gratitude for this country. </p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard lefties claim this in a long time.  But here and there it rears its ugly head.  The reason being is that information was made available and after a few protests on AZ someone spouted this out and no one responded,  No one called that person a racist or xenophobe.  They just shut up and hang their heads, like a friend found our their dirty, dark secret.  This is one piece of ammo to be loaded into the clip to shoot info at these nut cases because they have no response to it.  Its actually quite funny and you can see a few leftists actually question them selves.  like a bullet that flies past a soldier&rsquo;s head.  it didn&rsquo;t hit him, it didn&rsquo;t kill him, but it will make him pause for a minute and question Whether or not this fight is worth it and possibly what it is about.  This is one of our best responses to any question they have because they will actually reflect on what we said and question their worth.</p>

		<p>Guns FROM the US?? I occasionally get a flyer from a sporting goods store, and every firearm that&rsquo;s made in the USA is tagged with an American flag. I&rsquo;m actually sorry to say that only 10-20 percent of the guns advertised in the flyer are made here.</p>
<p>Bersa, Rossi, Uberti, Beretta, Browning, Glock&hellip;even many Winchesters and some Remingtons have been made in some of the very countries that complain about all the guns FROM the US.  </p>

<p>Lol, you didn&rsquo;t need this article.</p>
<p>The idea that &#8220;you put the gun in my hand&#8221; is a coward&rsquo;s argument.  Mexicans are not dogs, they&rsquo;re human beings.  If they&rsquo;re going to chop one another&rsquo;s heads off and throw grenades at one another, then <i>they&rsquo;re</i> to blame.  Not machete or grenade manufacturers.</p>
<p>Mexicans clearly have enormous problems with social stability and violence.  That they still haven&rsquo;t advanced past pointing the finger everywhere else shows how weak and immature they are as a people.</p>
