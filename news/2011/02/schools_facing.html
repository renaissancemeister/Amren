<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/education/09lunches.html?_r=2">Schools Facing Cuts If Lunches Aren&rsquo;t Paid For</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fernanda Santos, New York Times, February 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Of the 2,200 students at Intermediate School 61 in Corona, Queens, 86 percent receive free cafeteria lunches. Some others pay a reduced price, and some are supposed to pay full price.</p>
<p>But not all of their parents pay what they are supposed to, and recently, the school&rsquo;s principal, Joseph Lisa, has been spending a lot of time trying to collect money from them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Louisiana, some districts did not feed the children whose parents were in arrears at all, until, in November, the State Legislature passed a law ordering that they be given at least a snack, while directing districts to notify child welfare authorities if a student got just a snack on more than three consecutive days. Framingham, Mass., hired a constable to hand-deliver notices to parents whose bills were still unpaid after the schools had sent them several letters alerting them to their debt.</p>

		<p>I work in a school where about 70% of the students are illegal aliens.  Fine, they&rsquo;re nice kids for the most part and they don&rsquo;t give me any trouble, so I&rsquo;m nice to them.  (I just wish my tax dollars did not have to support them!)</p>
<p>About 95% of the students in our school get free or reduced lunch.  It is SO HARD to get the parents to fill out the simple forms for their kids to receive the free lunch.   We have to BEG them to fill out the forms.  When the kids do have food on their own it&rsquo;s always chips, candy and soda pop.  Always.</p>

		<p>If you read the main article it points out that over the past 6 years NYC&rsquo;s low-cost lunch program is $42 million in arrears. When you consider how cheap these lunches are, $42 million works out to a LOT of lunches - and a lot of parents not paying.</p>
<p>These facts are informative about the realities of the mostly minority underclass welfare culture. Clearly someone found out that if you don&rsquo;t pay then the school system wasn&rsquo;t going to make you pay, and they certainly weren&rsquo;t going to deny food to children (&#8220;who would not give food to little kid?). So very quickly the welfare culture adapted to this, saving a little money by not paying for lunches, making the &#8220;low-cost lunch program&#8221; into a &#8220;free lunch program.&#8221; Soon, once people find out this is going on, no one pays - you would be an idiot to do so.</p>
<p>It might seem like a trivial story, but I think it&rsquo;s interesting. It shows how lawlessness in some parts of society threaten the larger society. How is someone supposed to be content with paying taxes into the system when they learn that benefit recipients aren&rsquo;t even meeting their basic responsibilities?</p>
<p>The fact that race inevitably gets mixed up in all this - blacks disproportionately receive welfare like low-cost lunches - only adds to the problem. You have a white middle class being asked to pay into a system ripe being gamed and ripped off by a black underclass. Add to that the fact that this underclass then preys on the white middle class in the form of crime like robbery, making using public transportation unsafe and in general having a hostile attitude toward their white benefactors, and is there any wonder why the white middle class doesn&rsquo;t want to pay into the system?</p>
<p>Multiculturalism and diversity do not produce stable societies with strong systems of social welfare. People just don&rsquo;t have enough of a sense of community to do their part, either as recipients of benefits or as benefactors.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a black problem, although they are the worst when it comes to personal responsibility.  People today think that government should do everything for them.  We went from reduced school lunches, to free lunch to free breakfast and lunch. The more government does, or attempts to do, or promises to do the less the population does for themselves.  Although you need to government to provide certain common infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer systems, the government should stay out of the individuals day to day lives, which includes feeding one&rsquo;s own children.  My mother made my lunch every day for 12 years, except on rare occasions in grammar school for hoagie day.  And never once did I have the money to pay lunch in HS (grades 7-12 for me).  My younger siblings got to buy lunch more often as my parents were older and better of for a while.</p>
<p>And while not a specifically black problem they are the population that becomes the most accustomed to and least bale to revert to self-reliance.<br>

		<p>I take issue with the writer of this article. She states:</p>
<p>&#8220;School lunches are subsidized by the federal government, which spent $9.8 billion nationwide on the program in the 2009 fiscal year.&#8221; </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is school lunches are subsidized by the overburdened taxpayer, not &#8220;the federal government&#8221;. The payers of this subsidy are the same taxpayers who are charged full price for their children to eat lunch in school cafeterias. </p>

		<p>If you live in or near a major city with a lot of black or Hispanic children who are on the free or reduced lunch school program, then you are aware of a fad that has taken hold in the last several years   &mdash;   Summer continuation of free lunch.  It will be something along the lines of those within a certain age range, sometimes limited to those who are on free/reduced lunch during the school year, sometimes open to all, being able to go to community centers, meeting halls, etc. to eat lunch for free during weekdays (sometimes weekends too) during the summer months.</p>
<p>What is going on there is that it is assumed that those students on free/reduced lunch have that and only that to eat.  Even though many of them come from households whose heads are getting &#8220;food stamps.&#8221;  I guess they&rsquo;re right, because so many food stamp clients are handing over their food stamp debit cards to dope dealers with the security code number, in exchange for drugs.</p>

		<p>I have yet to see any child starving in this country. In fact, the majority of them could stand to lose a few pounds. Whatever happened to feeding the kids that you made? Ironically, I cannot afford to have my own kids, but my tax dollars must go to feed the anchor brats, of some illegal invader with irresponsible breeding habits. </p>
<p>I suspect most of those complaining the loudest; likely arrive to pick up their little darlings in Escalades, with 25 inch spinner rims to boot. <br>

<p>Roger that Jedderman. I too did the paper bag lunch thing through most of school (except on Hoagie day) lol. Anyway, my mom mostly made egg salad sandwiches, other kids moms made mostly PBJ, others, bologna &cheese; so many of us would trade sandwiches or drinks, cookies and such and had a group lunch&hellip;it worked out pretty well. Of course, we didn&rsquo;t have thieving blacks in our school either to disrupt our cooperative lunch groups.</p>

		<p>How outraged can someone be? I am a white male in my mid 50&rsquo;s. I am an Army veteran that was awarded the Army Commendation Medal. I grew up learning the ABC&rsquo;s and the &#8220;three R&rsquo;s!&#8221; I ate bologna sandwiches for lunch - packed by my mom - and I liked them! My dad was a plumber who worked 60 hours a week, but was always there on the weekends to fire up the grill! There were some weeks when we had to settle for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch - so what! it was OK! We did what we had to do! My God! Expect the government to provide our lunches? Are you kidding? There was not even a word back then to describe such a slack minded individual that would expect such a hand out!</p>

<p>When I was in high school I was mad because I had to spend $2 for a lunch at school while the welfare kids got lunch and breakfast for free. Then I found out I could buy a book of 25 coupons for $5 from a welfare kid so he could by dope. His coupons included breakfast and lunch. That was $0.20 for lunch and breakfast, and it was fairly good. I sure wish I could get free handouts.</p>

		<p>I used to watch parents drive up into the school lot in the morning to drop off their kids.  Many drove new cars, like new Lincoln Navigators (which I couldn&rsquo;t afford on my salary!) and their kids got free breakfast AND free lunch.  Yes, most of the food was thrown away.  I sampled some of the meals and they were darn good.  The kids were simply ungrateful and didn&rsquo;t care that they were costing our State an incredible amount of money.  Their parents didn&rsquo;t care either, of course.  When I was a kid, we ate breakfast at home - that was our parents&rsquo; responsibility, and we brought lunches to school in a sack or a lunch box - again, our parents&rsquo; responsibility.  What is it with these ethnics that they think somebody else is responsible for feeding THEIR children????</p>

		<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a free lunch&#8221;. <br>
Apparently unless you are a minority.</p>
<p>This story is the exact opposite of a news story I caught last night on this new concept of &#8220;pay what you want&#8221; restaurants.  <a href="http://goo.gl/kaS8k" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/kaS8k</a>  <br>
In this report they said that 60% of people voluntarily paid more than enough for their food, 20% paid just enough and 20% paid under what their food cost.<br>
Made me wonder what the racial break down of those groups were and to speculate which groups would be the ones to destroy this honesty based system (for everyone).</p>

		<p>This is silly.  We had a lunch program when I was in elementary school, and in junior high as well.  In elementary school, you brought cash each day to buy lunch with.  The number of kids receiving &#8220;free&#8221; lunches dropped off to about five each year for the fifth grade class.  When you hit fifth grade, you had to work during your lunch break to earn your lunch.  The truly poor kids were probably not happy about the situation, but no one that I know of mocked them for working for their lunch.  In junior high, you either paid cash or you paid in advance monthly.  My dad bought our lunches in advance, for a discount.  They also had a few students  &mdash;  not poor kids  &mdash;  working in the lunchroom during lunch and for an hour after school making $2.00 or so an hour, for spending money.  Of course, they were the first kids to get &#8220;real&#8221; jobs in high school at the few local fast food joints, having actual work experience that the rest of us did not have.  Of course, this would all probably be illegal now, if not horribly damaging to the self esteem of the children involved.</p>

		<p>This is insane.  For every dollar spent providing a lunch to a school child, $1000 is give to giant farm corporations in federal subsidies, often for NOT growing food.  </p>
<p>  School children need food at lunch.  End of that discussion.  Now deal with the unbelievable and wasteful giant agricultural subsudies that the stupid federal government gives away.  That will solve the problem.</p>

		<p>Like most others here, my mother packed our lunches or gave us the 35 cents (in those days) for a hot lunch.  </p>
<p>And NO, I did NOT enjoy the home-packed lunches of PB&J; or bologna, so in sixth grade (1970), I finagled a year of free lunches.  How?  In our elementary school, a student could volunteer for kitchen duty  &mdash;  and your pay was a free lunch!  No income qualification.<br>
You were excused from class ten minutes early (nice bonus), had to report to the kitchen and get ready for lunch set-up.  Afterwards, you had to gather trash, wash trays, wipe down tables, etc.</p>
<p>Now this was an actual working kitchen in our small school, with hot ovens, lunch ladies actually cooking, baking, peeling potatoes  &mdash;  -so it might be considered a &#8220;hazardous environment&#8221; for kids today and not permitted.  That&rsquo;s unfortunate, since it not only provided me with a free lunch, but a great work experience at a young age.</p>

		<p>I read all the above comments and it seems more than a few of you are becoming enraged.  Good.  And it&rsquo;s about time. Dave writes: <i>How outraged can someone be? There was not even a word back then to describe such a slack minded individual that would expect such a hand out!</i></p>
<p>Welfare has become a way of life, not a temporary helping hand.  We are on the third or fourth entitlement generation   &mdash;   those who derive their entire living expenses from the government from cradle to grave and reproduce at will with no consequences for their behavior.  As a very wise poster wrote last week:  </p>
<p>The entitlement class not only expects ALL of their expenses paid, they expect to live in luxury, they feel it&rsquo;s owed to them due to White Institutional Racism   &mdash;   this is what the media and government schools pound into them.</p>
<p>From Jay:  <i>It is SO HARD to get the parents to fill out the simple forms for their kids to receive the free lunch. We have to BEG them to fill out the forms.</i></p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.  That&rsquo;s why my friend&rsquo;s school actually ran a contest between homerooms to get kids to bring back the free lunch forms.  Winning class got an assembly or some such thing.</p>
<p>From Istavan:  <i>This isn&rsquo;t just a black problem, although they are the worst when it comes to personal responsibility.</i>  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let Hispanics off the hook.  They are just as bad, make NO MISTAKE. In California, Armenians and (I understand) Asians are jumping in as well.  Many work for cash, therefore show 0 income, making their kids eligible for free lunches and reduced fees on things like AP tests (regular fee $87 <br>
reduced to $5) or SAT tests (regular fee $48 reduced to $0) and college application forms ($0).  These are the kids that get dropped off in Mercedes SUVs every morning. </p>
<p>From Jedderman:  <i>90 % of that food they serve the kids is thrown away anyhow. Most of it is inedible or just lousy.</i></p>
<p>It has gotten much worse over the past two years and a lot of it is thrown out, especially any fruits and/or vegetables.  A few years ago some enterprising kids wanted to save this perfectly good food and give it to a homeless shelter or food bank.  They were shut down immediately by the Feds because the food has to be inspected first.  So, tons of perfectly good food went right back into the trash.</p>
<p>None of this makes me happy (as tax time looms ahead) but at least I get the impression that some of you are starting to become aware of what goes on in the public schools, the massive waste of funds, the futility of educating the left side of the Bell Curve past a rudimentary level, the deceitful lies told by the media.</p>
<p>Please tell everyone you know, and spread the word about the FRAUD of public education.</p>

<p>This happened all over the country once the blacks succeeded (rather quickly) in driving Whites out of the government projects.  They could not be evicted because the ACLU/ADL/NAACP/National Lawyers Guild/ Ford Foundation etc obtained court orders that blacks could not be evicted from housing projects.  Some blacks (on welfare of course) paid no rent at all in many of the projects for 30 or more years until the projects were finally demolished.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles all children with hispanic names get free lunch automatically.  Madonna&rsquo;s eldest child, Jennifer Lopez&rsquo;s, no matter how wealthy the parents, if a child with a hispanic name enrolls in a Los Angeles public school the kid gets free lunch, and breakfast and often an after school snack.</p>
<p>And in the summer free bag lunches are passed out in the parks and playgrounds in hispanic neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>I am also a former school teacher. I taught for 10 years at an all black school. Every year was a struggle just to get the parents to fill out the forms for free lunch. Since the school would not be reimbursed for the lunches unless the forms were filled out, all kinds of incentives were tried including giving the parents some type of gift if they turned their forms in on time or a pizza party for the classroom that had the most forms turned in by a certain date.  It unbelievable that one would have to provide more free things so the parents could fill out a form to get free things. Needless to say, like the teacher above observed, they all drove expensive cars and wore designer clothing. </p>

		<p>During lunch, I work in the school cafeteria checking off names and payment rates (free, reduced, full cash payment) of kids coming through the line. We have quite a few kids who simply hand over their &#8220;free&#8221; lunch to someone else, and quite a few who will take a bite and throw the rest away. We have kids who pre-order and don&rsquo;t pick up. When the cafeteria manager tells them that&rsquo;s wasteful, kids respond, &#8220;so what?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s status assignment. They waste because they can  &mdash;  it shows us we&rsquo;re not &#8220;the boss&#8221; of them. *Take that, you stupid taxpayer.* A lot of them don&rsquo;t know (or care) where the food comes from.

		<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m in the minority, but when I went to school in the 1970&rsquo;s, there was no such thing as a lunch program. Our school did not have a cafeteria.  Kids brought brown bags which they ate from at their desks during lunch break.</p>
<p>Making lunches the night before may have taught them the useful skills of planning and preparation.  </p>
<p>Of course, the students and parents were 100 percent white and everyone considered self-reliance to be a virtue.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t blame anybody for wanting a free meal.</p>

<p>You do not appreciate that which is provided for free, especially that which is provided by someone you do not personally know and am taught to despise (the white taxpayer).  This goes double for that which is &#8220;owed&#8221; to you.</p>

High academic scorers give a break - no- in their mind set they are given an award and I bet you they eat their lunches and enjoy it while their parents are encouraging them. Please apples to apples.</p>

		<p>In my all White Australian school of the 60s and 70s I recall every child comming to school with a &#8220;cut lunch&#8221;; usually one or two sandwitches and an apple or orange plus a refillable bottle of cordial.  We were happy, never hungry.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;tuckshop&#8221; (ie canteen) was staffed by volunteer mums and grandmothers.  They sold cheap salad sandwitches and a few sweets and cakes for the extra hungry or to cover for a working mom who didn&rsquo;t have time or more likely a kid that preferred the canteen so much he threw away his lunch.  We ate our lunches on benches without tables mostly in the open unless it was raining when we were allowed to eat at our desks.  Our text books were brought from the proceds of the canteen and the opperation of a yearly fete on the weekend and then handed to the next year.</p>
<p>I simply can&rsquo;t believe how utterly pitfull this free school lunch nonsense in some countries is.  Once this entitlement mentality takes hold the whole country seems to go on a slide downhill.  </p>
<p>How expensive must it be to opperate a canteen?  From what I&rsquo;ve seen the quality of state supplied food is actually quite low.  I&rsquo;m glad of my White background and the sense of self responsibillity I developed and perhaps always had.</p>
<p>Not giving your child a breakfast of cereal and a cut lunch makes you a deadbeat parent by the standards of the day and I have no doubt that it is intergenerational.  </p>
<p>It seems we are weighed down by taxes that are used to evermore subsidise and micromanage the welfare of the otherwise unfit.  In a way we are in a codependant relationship &#8216;enabling&rsquo; miscreant behaviour.</p>

&#8220;This is insane. For every dollar spent providing a lunch to a school child, $1000 is give to giant farm corporations in federal subsidies, often for NOT growing food. </p>
<p>School children need food at lunch. End of that discussion. Now deal with the unbelievable and wasteful giant agricultural subsudies that the stupid federal government gives away. That will solve the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talk about a red herring argument! Nobody said children &#8220;don&rsquo;t need food&#8221; at lunch. What&rsquo;s being said is perhaps those who had the children should be responsible for feeding them and not the tax payers. </p>
<p>We can talk about &#8220;wasteful giant agricultural subsidies&#8221;, which I&rsquo;m sure most of us would also have a problem with. </p>

<p>To Bon from the land of Babble:</p>
<p><i>High academic scorers give a break (sic) - no- in their mind set they are given an award</i></p>
<p>You are wrong and profoundly so.  What are you a mind reader? </p>
<p>What &#8220;mind set&#8221; might that be?  You mean like watching non-Whites vastly lower than them in achievement, scholarship and test scores receive college scholarships, academic achievement awards, special assemblies, mentoring programs, free SAT prep classes and FREE LUNCHES while high scoring White children receive nothing?</p>
<p>Explain to me clearly how that is fair.</p>
<p><i>and I bet you they eat their lunches and enjoy it while their parents are encouraging them. Please apples to apples.</i></p>
<p>You have obviously never worked in a school.</p>
<p>Pretending (like the government, media and academia) that IQs of 85-90 are equal and just as capable of achievement as IQs of 120+ is not apples to apples.</p>
<p>The FACT is high IQ&rsquo;d children to not &#8220;rise to the top&#8221; nor do they &#8220;pull up the bottom.&#8221;  They become discouraged, quickly, sink and drop out.  This is not in dispute.</p>
<p>It is loathsome, vile and outrageous that the government and educational system believe that it&rsquo;s OK not only to ignore White children but to vilify them as well while coddling those with limited abilities.</p>
