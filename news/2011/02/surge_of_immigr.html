			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Marosi and Andrew Becker, Los Angeles Times, February 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of immigrants from India have crossed into the United States illegally at the southern tip of Texas in the last year, part of a mysterious and rapidly growing human-smuggling pipeline that is backing up court dockets, filling detention centers and triggering investigations.</p>
<p>The immigrants, mostly young men from poor villages, say they are fleeing religious and political persecution. More than 1,600 Indians have been caught since the influx began here early last year, while an undetermined number, perhaps thousands, are believed to have sneaked through undetected, according to U.S. border authorities.</p>
<p>Hundreds have been released on their own recognizance or after posting bond. They catch buses or go to local Indian-run motels before flying north for the final leg of their months-long journeys.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Indian migration in some ways mirrors the journeys of previous waves of immigrants from far-flung places, such as China and Brazil, who have illegally crossed the U.S. border here. But the suddenness and still-undetermined cause of the Indian migration baffles many border authorities and judges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The influx shows signs of accelerating: About 650 Indians were arrested in southern Texas in the last three months of 2010 alone. Indians are now the largest group of immigrants other than Latin Americans being caught at the Southwest border.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the immigrants say they are from the Punjab or Gujarat states. They are largely Sikhs who say they face religious persecution, or members of the Bharatiya Janata Party who say they are targeted for beatings by members of the National Congress Party.</p>
<p>But analysts and human rights monitors say political conditions in India don&rsquo;t explain the migration. There is no evidence of the kind of persecution that would prompt a mass exodus, they say, and Sikhs haven&rsquo;t been targets since the 1980s. The prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, is a Sikh.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some authorities think the immigrants are simply seeking economic opportunities and are willing to pay $12,000 to $20,000 to groups that smuggle them to staging grounds in northern Mexico. Kibble said smugglers may have shifted to the Southwest after ICE dismantled visa fraud rings that brought Indians to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Many Indians begin their journey by flying from Mumbai to Dubai, then to South American countries such as Ecuador or Venezuela, according to authorities and immigration attorneys. Guatemala has emerged as the key transit hub into Mexico, they said. The roundabout journeys are necessary because Mexico requires visas for Indians.</p>
<p>They sneak across the dangerous Guatemala-Mexico border and take buses or private vehicles to the closest U.S.-Mexico border. Mexican organized crime groups are suspected of being involved either in running the operations or in charging groups tolls to pass through their territory.</p>
<p>The Indians usually wade across the Rio Grande, and then are shuttled from stash houses to transportation rings that take them north. David Aguilar, deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, said he believed a high percentage were caught as soon as they crossed the river.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The detainees eventually claim asylum. In January, immigration court calendars at the area&rsquo;s two main detention facilities were full of the common Indian surnames Patel and Singh, and attorneys and judges struggled to keep up. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Indians are largely unseen in the towns along the Rio Grande Valley, where they disappear into detention centers, stash houses or motel rooms. Some Sikhs have been confronted by locals alarmed by the sight of people wearing turbans, motel workers say.</p>

<p>No,but living conditions there certainly explain it. Living conditions that they will happily recreate here when they reach a sufficient number.</p>
<p>I went through O&rsquo;hare airport last year and was shocked by sheer ammount of Indians there who were arriving or waiting for their kinsmen to arrive. <br>
Nothing will be done to stop this, of course. All non whites are welcome. The more they let in, the quicker they can reduce whites to a minority.</p>

		<p>The public only knows of about 50% of the illegal immigration into the USA.  We know about crossing the southern border by foot or through tunnels.  We know about tourists and students who overstay their visas.  </p>
<p>What most citizens don&rsquo;t know are the other ways to sneak into the USA.  Nearly every week another cargo or container ship docks in an American port, filled, in some cases, with hundreds of illegals.  At night, by truck, boat, or through tunnels, these people are off-loaded and sent to safe-houses. These illegals are primarily from Asia, the Middle East or Eastern Europe.  </p>
<p>ICE knows about this, but does little to stop it.  Go to Seattle, L.A. or NYC.  There you will see hundreds of thousands of non-Hispanic foreigners, who can speak little English.  They just arrived!  How did they get here?  Hundreds off-load daily.  Our government doesn&rsquo;t care.  </p>

A surge of immigrants on the Texas border baffles officials?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because everyone in the world knows there is no enforcement along the Texas-Mexican border.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t figure this out???</p>

		<p>What stunning irony.</p>
<p>India has built border fences of 4000km on its frontier with Bangladesh, 550km at Kashmir, and a 1600km fence on the border with Burma, to halt narcotics and human smuggling. India, impoverished as it is, has a problem with illegals.  </p>
<p>The much wealthier U.S. can&rsquo;t finish a 3100km wall.</p>

		<p>This is not rocket science, folks.</p>
<p>The border with Mexico is wide open, even illiterate Mexican and Latin American indians and peons can manage to cross&hellip;.I am sure the Asians can too.</p>
<p>So if there is no one guarding the border, anyone who wants to can just walk in, so they do. We get more Mex because they are closer, but others get in too.</p>
<p>The motel owners should have their properties confiscated for aiding and abetting the illegal aliens avoid (feeble) interior enforcement.<br>

		<p>I wonder how many illegal immigrants are going across our southern border who originally come from Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Saudi, Arabia etc.? You never hear about these do you? If each of them carried a nut and a bolt with them they could have built a nuclear reactor by now.</p>

		<p>So this story merely adds more weight to the fact and confirms that the billions of tax-payer dollars that the fed-gov is blowing (each month) on &#8220;THE WAR ON TERROR&#8221;  TERROR!!! is a five star scam.</p>
<p>Anyone can (and apparently does)just stroll across the border unimpeded with zero background check to engage in God knows what sort of illicit activities and the fed government does NOTHING.</p>
<p>Meanwhile US citizens with valid passports and drivers licensees are being probed for colon cancer, by the same fed government, before they can get on an airplane.</p>

		<p>The all you can breed Indians,legal or illegal,have been swamping the Western societies all over the world.Yet these are the people who will pathetically claim their country is the beacon of light for the world.The West and the rest will never stop the tsunami of these weird creatures being unleashed on all the continents unless their giant breeding farm in India is outlawed by UN security council and ferociously enforced by military.</p>

<p>  I certainly have noticed more Hindi&rsquo;s in rural areas of the South. Could some of these scofflaws be coming via the Texas smuggling pipeline? We are told by the media that India is an emerging great power, but the huge number of people wanting to leave India for white countries tells an entirely different story.  </p>

		<p>Everybody commenting abovw are right - our govenment doesn&rsquo;t care and will not do anything to stop the flood of illegals, regardless where they come from. Oh, maybe one exception- whites I suppose are fair game since they don&rsquo;t have any immigrant/political lobby behind them. </p>
<p>Personal comment - I&rsquo;d rather have illegal Mexicans than Indians if I had to choose. Indians are the most obnoxious people in the world, spare none. People living in Silicon Valley know what I&rsquo;m talking about. If you don&rsquo;t have them in your community (yet) look out. </p>

<p>This never ceases to blow my mind. And you hear it all the time about illegals coming from everywhere. If they have that much cash to give to a coyote then why the Hell are they coming here? For twenty grand they could live like kings in India or Mexico.</p>

<p>Factually incorrect.  The wheelers and dealers of the subcontinent are the Gujaratis.  Sikhs are known for their fighting prowess (disproportionately represented in the Indian Army) and their farming abilities (Punjab is the bread basket of India). <br>
