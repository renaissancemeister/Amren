<p>{snip} New York has developed a host of niche markets that allow the city&rsquo;s many immigrants to get tucks and tweaks that are carefully tailored to their cultural preferences and ideals of beauty. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When a patient comes in from a certain ethnic background and of a certain age, we know what they&rsquo;re going to be looking for,&#8221; said Dr. Kaveh Alizadeh, the president of Long Island Plastic Surgical Group, which has three clinics in the city. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Many Egyptians are getting face lifts. Many Italians are reshaping their knees. Dr. Alizadeh says his fellow Iranians favor nose jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} A century ago, [ethnic] operations were targeted at assimilation issues,&#8221; Ms. Pitts-Taylor [Victoria Pitts-Taylor, a professor of sociology at Queens College who has written about popular attitudes toward plastic surgery.] said.</p>
<p>Today, [rather] than striving to fit in to their new country, many immigrants reshape themselves to their home culture&rsquo;s trends and tastes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps the most sought-after procedure among Asians is &#8220;double-eyelid surgery,&#8221; which creates a crease in the eyelid that can make the eye look rounder. {snip}<br>
&#8220;One of the traits of beauty is to have large eyes,&#8221; Dr. Lee said, &#8220;and to get that effect you have to have the double eyelids.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I remember a 200 million dollar lotto night at the bar. A perky 20 something CPA named Debbie said that if she won,the first thing she would buy would be breast aumentation surgery. <br>
 And the high school busboy said that if HE won, he`d be happy to pay for it&hellip;</p>

<p>Sounds like a contradiction to me. They&rsquo;re not worried about fitting in and yet they want to make their eyes look rounder? Or is this saying that this tendency is so common in their home countries that it&rsquo;s become part of their native culture?</p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons I enjoy being White (half-Norwegian/ half-German)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have to worry about having these humiliating surgeries done!  </p>

		<p>This White man can&rsquo;t understand why any Orientals would want to change the shape of their eyelids, which are distinctive, and, on females, very attractive.  At the very least, you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have more racial pride than that.</p>
<p>If I were to move to Japan, I would certainly learn to speak the language, but I&rsquo;d consider having surgery to implant an epicanthic fold in my eyelids a sign of creeping insanity.<br>

		<p>My Russian wife (going on 12 years now, for those of you who pooh-pooh marrying a girl from the former Soviet Union), fortunately is blessed to the extent that she need never have breast augmentation surgery.  It is, however, a comfort to know that these Russian girls are open to the idea.  God love them.  I know I do! </p>

<p>I do not find the Oriental eyes attractive whatsoever on females or males. I do find the Caucasian eyes and shape beautiful for the most part and they have the variations of all colors, which nonwhites do not have, as all have brown eyes period with no variations of colors. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been told that I have Asian-looking eyes due to some Amerind ancestor from at least seven generations back.  I simply shrug and say &#8220;oh well.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also got made fun of in junior high for having &#8220;Japanese eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to run out and get plastic surgery.  I&rsquo;m at least 96% white (Anglo-Saxon-Celtic  &mdash;  lots of Scottish, with Polish and Russian), I identify as white, and it doesn&rsquo;t really bother me.</p>
<p>I just wish my mother would quit harping on the tiny bit of Amerind we have.  Smacks of white guilt to me.</p>

East Asians want to look like white people.  They fiercely deny it but everyone can see with their own eyes.  East Asians have yellowish to brown skin color not white, black hair not blonde, brown or red, brown eyes not blue, green or hazel, bell-shaped noses not straight noses, slanty eyes not round eyes.  Unfortunately, many white people go too far with tanning making themselves look worse and age their skin in the process.</p>

		<p>One seldom comes across a Korean girl who has NOT colored her hair to an auburn shade.</p>
<p>It is as though they are embarrassed about having black hair.<br>
