<h1>Former Luxury Hotel Home to Thousands of Squatters</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Fallon and Mark Tutton, CNN, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s the hotel where many guests have lived all their lives and some may never check out.</p>
<p>Once one of the most luxurious hotels in southern Africa, the Grande Hotel, in Beira, Mozambique, was abandoned by its original owners five decades ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now home to between 2,000 and 3,000 people who live in squalid conditions, without running water or electricity. Yet for these people the crumbling building is a self-contained community where they sleep, eat and work.</p>
<p>The once-luxurious lodging is the subject of a movie by Belgian filmmaker Lotte Stoops, which has just had its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival.</p>
<p>Stoops stayed near the Grande Hotel during a month-long trip to Mozambique six years ago and was fascinated by what she saw.<br/>
The once-luxurious lodging is the subject of a movie by Belgian filmmaker Lotte Stoops, which has just had its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officially opened in 1955, when Mozambique was still a Portuguese colony, the Grande closed its doors as a working hotel in the mid 60s.</p>
<p>By 1992, when the country&rsquo;s 16-year civil war ended, the building was accommodating refugees from all over Mozambique.</p>
<p>There were originally 110 guest rooms, but Stoops says every bit of space in the building is now used as a living area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The telephone booths have been cut off and made into a room, the corridor is a room,&#8221; said Stoops, who estimates there are currently about 350 families living there.</p>
<p>There is little inside the hotel to hint at its former splendor. Glass has been taken from its windows and sold, while wood from the interior has been used to build fires, said Stoops.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of the building&rsquo;s original squatters have claimed rooms as their own and now act as landlords, letting them to others.</p>
<p>Although there is no electricity, running water or sewage system, the residents are expert improvisers. Some access electricity by connecting to external cables, while one or two have solar panels, said Gamariel. The hotel&rsquo;s outdoor swimming pool is now used to wash laundry, while the pool changing room is used as a mosque.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Piles of rubbish fill the building with a pungent smell and attract rats, said Gamariel. Trees grow from the roof of the hotel, their roots penetrating the top floors, causing alarming cracks to develop in the walls. And while Gamariel said it was safe to visit during the day, he advised against going at night.</p>
<p>Gamariel said a local Muslim community group has successfully re-housed some residents in new homes on the outskirts of the city. But he added that for every family that moves out, another replaces it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some residents don&rsquo;t want to leave. For some, as well as being their home, the Grande Hotel provides their livelihoods. Its corridors act as market places, with traders selling everything from sugar to toiletries. Others sell fruit and vegetables in front of the hotel entrance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There were stories of murders,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I also wanted to show the positive parts and focus on the survival stories.&#8221;<br/>

So the best stories they can come up with after the &#8220;white devils&#8221; were driven off is that some blacks have survived? Really?</p>
<p>Even German do-gooders were rubbing their eyes when they saw the first blacks from South Africa trying to get to Europe after South Africa was not getting the paradise they expected, and they realized blacks came here the same way, they once went to South Africa.</p>

		<p>Of course this is what happened.  Did anyone expect anything different?</p>
<p>Africans are incapable of maintaining a modern, technological society.  When left to their own, they quickly destroy any infrastructure, and revert to a more primitive state. Thousands of examples now exist, from Zimbabwe to Haiti to Detroit. </p>

		<p>LOVE what they did with the POOL!</p>
<p>Reading Amren is so much more entertaining than watching the news (which we no longer do, since the TVs were returned to their packing boxes). </p>
<p>I googled around, and found two Youtube videos on the Grande Hotel, plus several articles.  So, to be fair, I have to say that the Hotel, in its original state, was grotesque: ugly, even by Fifties standards.</p>
<p>The utter lack of landscaping gave the Hotel a lower-middle-class vibe. But the room rates, necessary in such an enormous structure with so few guestrooms, would have required an upper-middle-class clientele. The greige color scheme was bleak and depressing. Compare the place with its contemporaries, Morris Lapidus&rsquo; wondrous Fontainebleau and Eden Roc Hotels (Miami Beach), and you&rsquo;ll see how far the Grande Hotel missed the mark.  The scheme was doomed from the start (as have been most white enterprises on that continent).</p>
<p>Prosperous farmers from nearby Rhodesia took their holidays on Mozambique&rsquo;s beaches.  They were the Hotel&rsquo;s target demographic.  Unfortunately, the erudite, cultivated North Europeans who farmed Rhodesia would have been appalled by the barren aspect of the &#8216;Grande&rsquo;, an edifice informed by the Latino contempt for plant life.  North Europeans (wherever they live) crave abundant greenery.  Arabs, Spaniards, and Portuguese seem to be uncomfortable with much more than a few potted plants.  So, it is no wonder that the hotel went out of business, before the Communist era.</p>
<p>Today, the swimming pool (depending on which article one is to believe) is either used for washing, or as a gargantuan toilet.  Refuse is also disposed of, by tossing it over the balconies.  Articles also wax rhapsodic over the &#8216;fact&rsquo; that this colony is highly &#8216;organized&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>But their &#8216;organization&rsquo; seems not to extend as far as waste collection, growing of food on the vast grounds, or even as far as removing the trees growing on the roof. The trees are acknowledged as accelerating the collapse of the structure.  Apparently, Africans (pure Africans, on their own) are incapable of organizing to achieve even the most rudimentary common goals.</p>

		<p>&#8220;2,000 and 3,000 people&#8221; is about the number of Beirans, who could be directly (and indirectly as family members) deriving a decent living from the Grande Hotel. If the establishment had remained under competent management, instead of African anarchy, Africans would have been the main beneficiaries. Apparently the residents make little or no attempt at even survival maintenance, i.e. tree roots threatening the upper floors. </p>

		<p>Is it just my imagination or is the media hell bent on promoting the black as something they are not and will never be?<br/>
I was watching a commercial for a major greeting card company where a very black young male was giving a Valentines Day Card to a very excited smiling young white female.<br/>
I guess the secret message isn&rsquo;t really that much of a secret, is it?</p>

		<p>No running water means no sprinkler system and no electricity means the use of fire for cooking and light. </p>

<p>From the photo, it looks like its designer worked in maximum security prisons!</p>
<p>One thing that struck me from my time in Rhodesia, South Africa, and parts adjoining was how even a small number of Whites (with perhaps an able assist from Indians) could keep a much larger black populace running a functioning modern society. Yet after Smith stepped down in Rhodesia, within two year, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s cities were already starting to show the signs of decay. Maintaining a civilization really is the work of a small number of people. </p>
<p>We might consider how Western elites have abdicated this leadership back in North America and Europe&hellip;</p>
<p>Just a random observation&hellip;</p>

		<p>Rhetorical question: Is there anywhere on the planet, right now, where large numbers of whites live in such conditions?  I&rsquo;m aware that there are poor whites in the US, usually in remote rural areas, &amp; that there are individuals who live in squalor for whatever reason (mental health problems usually).  But thousands of whites living together like this&hellip;?  I don&rsquo;t think so. If it happened at all the news would be all over it.  And yet with blacks it seems to be not at all uncommon throughout the world.<br/>

		<p>When this place does fall down or burn down, the residents will find a way to blame whites for the catastrophe. It is always that way. The media will go right along with that, and many whites will suffer guilt complexes, and vow to do whatever it takes to help those blacks who have suffered yet again from white racism. Various Hollywood celebrities will surely join in to help Africa. <br/>
They will surely say it is our fault for leaving the place standing.We will be accused of not caring enough about Africans. We will be called racists! And if we had torn it down, we would be accused of denying the noble black African of something wonderful and advanced, why we would be accused of racism. With blacks, you are damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t. </p>

<p>&ldquo;There were stories of murders,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I also wanted to show the positive parts and focus on the survival stories.&rdquo;<br/>
 </p>
<p>Of COURSE you wanted to show the positive parts   &mdash;   you&rsquo;re a guilty white liberal, and that&rsquo;s what guilty white liberals do: make black reality look far better than it really is. </p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m an optimist by nature too, I believe in &#8220;accentuate the positive.&#8221; But when the negatives HUGELY outnumber the positives   &mdash;   as they do in this depressingly familiar tale of black-driven devolution   &mdash;   then it&rsquo;s time to take a more realistic approach. Trying to find positives in the decline and fall of Mozambique&rsquo;s Grand Hotel, well, it&rsquo;s like looking for a something-or-other in a coalmine. </p>
<p>Turning a swimming pool into a gigantic laundry tub (or worse) is NOT progress. Changing of waste-disposal customs from indoors plumbing to chamberpots dumped over the balcony is a society that&rsquo;s going BACKWARDS, not forwards. Letting trees grow randomly on the roof of a hotel is NOT an exciting new development in architecture, it&rsquo;s a health hazard. </p>
<p>As for the &#8220;survival stories,&#8221; well, you better write &#8216;em soon Ms. Stoops, because once the cracks from that rooftop jungle get big enough, the ceilings will start coming down on the heads of the squatters. And when that happens, there won&rsquo;t be a lot of survivors for naive European filmmakers to tell their stories about. </p>
