			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FoxNews, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Federal, state and local authorities conducted a massive sweep Thursday of suspected Mexican drug cartel members in the United States in a widespread domestic response to the killing of a U.S. agent in Mexico last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking a stand and we are sending a message back to the cartels that we will not tolerate the murder of a U.S. agent, or any U.S. official,&#8221; said Carl Pike, assistant special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s special operations division.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By Thursday morning, agents in areas including Atlanta, St. Louis, Denver, Detroit, San Antonio, San Diego, Chicago and New Jersey had seized more than $4.5 million in cash and nearly 20 guns, arrested more than 100 people and confiscated about 23 pounds of methamphetamine, 107 kilos of cocaine, 5 pounds of heroin and 300 pounds of marijuana at more than 150 different locations.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata was killed, and fellow ICE agent Victor Avila was wounded in Mexico on Feb. 15 when the Chevy Suburban they were in was run off the road by at least two vehicles loaded with armed men. Authorities have said the agents, who were driving in a fortified sport utility vehicle with diplomatic license plates, identified themselves as U.S. diplomats in the moments before the shooting.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities have arrested one person in connection with the brazen attack, which is believed to be the work of members of Mexico&rsquo;s Zetas gang. Former Mexican special forces soldiers are among its members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, Mexican President Felipe Calderon complained that U.S. help in the fight against warring cartels has been &#8220;insufficient.&#8221; He made the comment to a Mexican newspaper in response to recently disclosed secret diplomatic cables in which U.S. officials criticized his anti-drug strategy. Calderon told the newspaper that the dispatches show U.S. diplomats&rsquo; ignorance about Mexican security efforts.</p>
<p>More than 35,000 people have been killed since Calderon launched a crackdown against drug gangs in December 2006.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities are leading the investigation of Zapata&rsquo;s death and the Justice Department has announced a joint task force, led by the FBI, with the Homeland Security Department.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip; in a widespread domestic response to the killing of a U.S. agent in Mexico last week.&#8221;: I guess my questions are - What if the agent had not been killed?  Would the hundreds of pounds of drugs not been intercepted and thus allowed to stay on the street, even though it appears we knew of the whereabouts of the drugs, guns, and people?  Just what is it we do in regard to the &#8220;War on drugs&#8221;, if we know of such information and do little about it unless an agent is killed?  I become more and more cynical every day&hellip;</p>

<p><br>
Shouldn&rsquo;t the policy of not tolerating murder be extended to all US citizens or must one be on the public payroll before your life is valued by law enforcement.</p>
<p>Better yet, how about protecting the border of our own country instead of those in the ME and central Asia.</p>

		<p>At any time, the US could instantly destroy the drug cartels.  All it would take is discrimination in welfare.  Welfare is for old people in nursing homes&hellip;..welfare is not for multi-incarceration drug criminals.</p>
<p>An easy way to do this is every month, someone on welfare would show up at a local clinic.  Hair and urine would be taken from them under police guard&hellip;..and sent to a lab.  A positive test would de-activate their welfare cash cards.</p>
<p>Why do this?  Because the lions share of welfare is used to buy drugs.  And the mexicans are here not only to get their share but to make money supplying those drugs.  Make it impossible for a drug user to get welfare and the second and third biggest exports (drugs and children for sex) for mexico become worthless.</p>
<p>At a time when the US is clamoring to cut budgets, no one mentions what that welfare money is being spent on and why we might want to put a stop to it.</p>

		<p>It is terrible what has happened, but it needs to be mentioned that this only happened because it was an ICE agent.  If they really arrested and detained 60 illegals for every murder committed by one, we wouldn&rsquo;t have any illegals here.</p>
<p>Well maybe this will wake up the agency.  And I hope I&rsquo;m wrong, but this is probably the first of MANY.  If that is what it takes than so be it.  If we used our heads to begin with, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess today.</p>

<p>There is a bill going through the Missouri legislature that would do pretty much that.  The difference is that a welfare client who shows a positive test for those drugs wouldn&rsquo;t be cut off, just that their benefits would have to be handled by a responsible (i.e. no rap sheet, no drug problem) third party, so that the welfare client&rsquo;s &#8220;children&#8221; won&rsquo;t have to &#8220;do without.&#8221;  The point is to get resources out of the hands of drug addicts so that they have nothing with which to pay the dealers.</p>
<p>And, predictably, a lot of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organizations are complaining.  I think I can almost take that as evidence that these &#8220;civil rights&#8221; orgs are getting indirect funding from illicit drug profits, laundered several times along the way.</p>

		<p>Remember when the American ship the Mayaguez was supposedly hit by North Vietnamese fire and the pretext for the war was laid? Now the bar is set pretty high, isn&rsquo;t it? What would, you ask, cause the USA to take Mexico seriously? An invasion of 5000 troops into <br>
Texas, perhaps.</p>

		<p>Is the melting pot still alive and well, so that after some time of residence here by both muslims and the mexican drug cartels, there will be no discernible difference in the way they carry out their beheadings?</p>
<p>For the sake of the cultural unity of our country, I certainly hope so.</p>

		<p>Officially, these arrests are called a &#8220;widespread domestic response&#8221; to the murder of the two ICE agents in Mexico.  A much more rosy way of saying &#8220;revenge.&#8221;  BTW, those ICE agents were in a State Department vehicle, and everyone in it was unarmed, at the command of the State Department.  Practically begging to get assassinated.  Thanks a lot, Obama/Hillary.</p>
<p>But the greater point is this:  Why couldn&rsquo;t we round these Mexican drug gangsters in America up sooner?  That we did it so soon after the assassination in Mexico means that we had the goods on them all along.  So what was the wait?  Does American Federal law enforcement only have information on these ne&rsquo;er do wells for the sole purpose of using it later on and as a means of retribution?  Here&rsquo;s a radical idea for you   &mdash;   Don&rsquo;t wait until they pick off one of ours before we round up some of theirs.  Round up some of theirs first, and this might preclude them picking off one of ours.</p>

<p>This country is a joke. I would be laughing a lot harder if only I didn&rsquo;t live here. The Police&rsquo;s behavior is typical and predictable. </p>
<p><br>
1)Do absolutely nothing to stop crime because of imminence incompetence.</p>
<p>2)When there is a huge amount of evince of Police incompetence, they go psycho and arrest everyone they can that should have been arrested 3 years earlier. In the corporate world it is called restructuring. File cabinets get moved, walls get painted, new furniture is purchased, and the guys at the top get a raise. A lot of work is done but nothing is accomplished. Just like this gang sweep. </p>
<p>3) After the mediocre accomplishment and finally doing what they are getting paid to do, the Police beat there chest and tell everyone how wonderful they are. </p>

		<p><i>Federal, state and local authorities conducted a massive sweep Thursday of suspected Mexican drug cartel members in the United States.</i></p>
<p>Sure, and good luck with that.</p>
<p><i>The U.S. Justice Department reports that Mexican drug cartels now operate in 2,500 U.S. cities and towns.</i> </p>
<p><i>The Mexican drug trafficking organizations have established permanent base camps in &#8216;strategic locations in the hills of southern Arizona from which their scouts can monitor every move made by law enforcement officials&rsquo; as reported by Adam Housley for FOX News.</i></p>
<p>And, they are armed with military-grade weapons:</p>
<p><i>The Zetas are armed to the teeth. Their arsenal ranges from semi-automatic rifles to rocket-propelled grenades, assault rifles, grenades, dynamite, fragmentation grenades, bulletproof vests, Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifles and a Light Anti Tank (LAW) rocket.</i></p>
<p><i>Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata was killed, and fellow ICE agent Victor Avila was wounded in Mexico</i></p>
<p>Let me ask the following:  Would the Feds have had such a reaction if the agents were White?</p>
<p>What was the reaction from the Feds after border agent Brian Terry, 40, was gunned down in December <b>10 miles inside the US</b>?  Calls for more border security?  For completion of the border fence?  For a crackdown on heavily armed smugglers operating on US territory?</p>
<p>Not that the USG cares for Native Born Citizens, especially if they&rsquo;re White.</p>

<p>Heh, my respect for government employees continues to grow.</p>
<p>The message they send is &#8220;we will not secure our national borders, we will not do anything to enforce the law, we will not protect our country from the immivasion, and furthermore, we won&rsquo;t have <i>anyone else</i> doing these things, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>I always thought the purpose -that is the Entire purpose- of government was to protect it&rsquo;s Citizens, not merely it&rsquo;s &#8220;agents and officers.&#8221;  Guess that does not hold true anymore.</p>
<p>Once (many years ago) the County Sherrif came to my school, he said something that I think is very important, and that I know they no longer teach&hellip; it stuck with me. </p>
<p>He said: &#8220;My nightstick is there for me to protect myself, my gun is there for me to protect everyone else.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
In other words, the life of Any other citizen was more important than his own -that was his job; to protect his citizens, at the cost of his own life if needed -his gun was not for his own defense, it existed only to prevent bodily injury to another citizen -and as a last resort. I hope that where ever he is now (rest his soul) he does not have to see what his country has become.</p>
