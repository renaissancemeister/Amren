			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Members of an African American Student Union were left open-mouthed and outraged after a white, freshman was hired for a top job within the group.</p>
<p>Torey McCleskey, a first year student at University of North Florida, was handed the coveted assistant director role, after a unanimous decision from the institution&rsquo;s Senate.</p>
<p>However AASU members argue that Mr McCleskey, an athletic training and sports medicine student, has never actually set foot in the AASU&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&#8216;We didn&rsquo;t even know who he was. He has attended one event and he left early,&rsquo; a member told Newsforjax.com.</p>
<p>They also said the student, who is a &#8216;slam&rsquo; poet, has little experience. Around a dozen or so members took to campus grounds to protest the decision yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8216;The decision-making, the selection process of his appointment was unlawful,&rsquo; Christa Merix, an executive cabinet member of AASU who was up for the job herself,&rsquo; told the website.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is the main purpose why we are here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Merix and and John Iyoyo, a mechanical engineering junior, were both candidates alongside Mr McCleskey, according to the university&rsquo;s student newspaper.</p>
<p>AASU argue that both were much more qualified for the position.</p>
<p>Miss Merix, an advertising student, has been with the AASU for three years, has served on the cabinet and was chosen by the advisory board for the role.</p>
<p>The appointment decision was decided in a tense debate at the Senate on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, The Spinnaker reported.</p>
<p>Current director of the AASU, Joanna Hillman said in the meeting that Student Body President Sitou Byll-Cataria&rsquo;s choice to hire Mr McCleskey was racially driven and unlawful.</p>
<p>&#8216;They (Mr Byll-Cataria and Student Body Vice President Giovannie Medina) are using Torey as a white poster-child for diversity to fulfil their personal agenda of a multicultural agency,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>But Mr Medina hit back saying: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t see colour when I interview candidates. My principles aren&rsquo;t based on that, how I was raised was not based on that,&rsquo; according to The Spinnaker.</p>
<p>Many members, including Ms Hillman said Mr McCleskey&rsquo;s race was not the issue but the lack of experience was. </p>
<p>However supporters of the Mr McCleskey went on to argue that he was more than qualified for the job.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the student tried to make light of the situation. &#8216;Variety is the spice of life,&rsquo; he said, &#8216;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I like my food spicy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But protesters may not see it this way. Yesterday they announced they weren&rsquo;t going to stop until something was done about the appointment.</p>
<p>They said they want Mr McCleskey removed and the approval process overhauled so this sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>However Miss Merix reiterated the AASU sentiment by saying their decision to protest had nothing to do with race.</p>
<p>&#8216;It has nothing to do with the assistant director who was appointed,&rsquo; she told Newsforjax.com. &#8216;It&rsquo;s the decision making that went with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr McCleskey didn&rsquo;t seem to be taking it personally either when he walked right past the protest, saying that the students had a right to speak their minds.</p>
<p>The AASU was founded 20 years ago. Today it has 200 members and its focus is African-American enrichment.<br>

<p>The quotes from the blacks are pretty telling. They are outraged and indignant, or situation normal. They say it&rsquo;s not about race but experience and qualifications.  Ha, when YT says that they are shouted down as bigots and whiners.  </p>
<p>It should be noted that the Student Body President, who orchestrated this move, looks to be an African.  Maybe he has a beef with the American blacks.  </p>

		<p>A less qualified (supposedly) white gets the job over two more qualified non-whites in an institution historically geared to non-whites?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it feel?</p>
<p>Technically, Miss Merix, what might be &#8220;unlawful&#8221; is Mr. McCleskey being denied the position only because he is white.  </p>
<p>Overall, unless he&rsquo;s doing it as a ruse, just to showcase black racial hypocrisy, then I question Mr. McCleskey&rsquo;s mental health.</p>

		<p>It is so fun to see the blacks&rsquo; reaction when this happens to them. They are so insensitive! I enjoy seeing the shoe on the other foot. Now they can appreciate how white people feel about less qualified blacks getting the job.</p>

		<p>One of the most satisfying things in the world is to see the rules that blacks demand from whites for &#8220;equality&#8221; be applied to themselves. Their outrage is very telling.</p>

		<p>They should be grateful for the help.  I personally have no problem with white people who help blacks achieve independence.  It is painfully obvious that they are still not fully capable of doing it for themselves by and large.  I see another century of carrying American blacks though the weight will drop off quicker as Hispanics, who are considerably more driven to being self-sufficient, grow in number and political power.  <br>
 <br>
While I don&rsquo;t have any genuine hatred of blacks, I am wise enough to understand their hatred of me, ridiculous as it is.  I think blacks are really starting to feel the pinch.  The current mayor of Atlanta beat his white opponent by the skin of his teeth.  The ghettos and housing projects are being bulldozed.  I&rsquo;ve been watching it happen since the 80s, when I started to care.<br>
 <br>
My feeling though is that if American blacks can become self-sufficient, we can end the entitlement programs that magnify their mis-placed contempt of white Americans.  There was once a time when blacks welcomed the assistance of an intelligent white man.  Our own government&rsquo;s meddling has turned that around on all of us.</p>

		<p>5 Idareya:  Stranger than that are the blacks who complain about &#8220;white segregation&#8221; in a previous generation, demand and get the legal dismantling of the segregationist system, win elections themselves (in areas that are majority black), then turn right around and re-implement most of the segregationist system under a different name and claiming that it&rsquo;s for the &#8220;people&rsquo;s&#8221; own good.</p>

		<p>The most &#8216;racist&rsquo; thing here and on the campus is that there is no White United Students group at University of North Florida. This situation exists at every college in the nation, as far as I know, regardless of the history or Demographics. The university does everything they can to bring about &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, meanwhile they are the main ones blocking diversity by not have any white interest or white student groups on campus. White interests aren&rsquo;t representing in the curriculum either, except as a mention of &#8216;privilege&rsquo; and oppressors.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It has nothing to do with the assistant director who was appointed,&rsquo; she told Newsforjax.com. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the decision making that went with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>How come I suspect the &#8220;decision making process&#8221; would have worked just fine had a she, a black, been selected for the position? Obviously the White candidate was selected because he&rsquo;s the best person for the job. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, blacks do not understand this concept because of years of entitlement programs paving the way for them. Merit, or lack thereof, has never been a worry for this group.</p>
<p>Another example of a black racist, displaying the attitude of entitlement, after feeding at the affirmative action trench her entire life.</p>

		<p>Ha, ha, ha! First the student union, then the NBA. It&rsquo;s getting hard to keep us Whites in our place. Maybe someday one of us will be President of the U.S.A.</p>
