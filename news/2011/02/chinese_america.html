<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Feb. 6 incident began when the 25-year-old victim placed an order for takeout at a Korean restaurant in the 18300 block of East Colima Road in Rowland Heights, said Sgt. Steven Kim of the L.A. County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department&rsquo;s Asian Gang Team.</p>
<p>A group of seven Korean American men were eating inside the restaurant when one of them approached the victim, whose name was not released, and asked if he was Korean. He responded that he was Chinese and shortly after received his order and left the restaurant.</p>
<p>The man who had approached the victim followed him outside, accompanied by five other men. Once outside, the suspects began beating the victim with their hands and feet &#8220;for no apparent reason,&#8221; Kim said.</p>
<p>The suspects then vandalized the victim&rsquo;s car, &#8220;causing hundreds if not thousands of dollars in damage,&#8221; Kim said. It was later determined they had stolen the victim&rsquo;s wallet and taken his GPS navigator.</p>
<p>Several bystanders intervened to stop the assault. Kim said the man &#8220;suffered numerous cuts and bruises all over his body, including a large cut on the top of his head, which required medical staples.&#8221; </p>
<p>Deputies from the Walnut station tracked down and arrested one of the suspects, identified by authorities as Jachin Yi, 18, of Diamond Bar, after witnesses came forward with a license plate number. Deputies also arrested Peter Kim, 19, after they found his ATM card in the parking lot where the man had been beaten.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The at-large suspects were identified by authorities as members or associates of the Korean American street gang &#8220;Asian Mafia Assassins,&#8221; based in eastern L.A. County.</p>
<p>Investigators on Tuesday arrested Hwan Joon Huh, 29, of Diamond Bar, and Jae Du, 25, of West Covina, in their homes. Efforts to track down at least two other suspects were continuing, Kim said.</p>

		<p>My sincere apologies to the Chinese man and the man&rsquo;s family members on their behalf.  I of course no excuses.  It is my deepest desire that the the five Korean men receive the appropriate punishments and disciplines!  You know they are cowards when five men attack one person.  If anything the Chinese person was a nice person who respected and enjoyed the Korean culture and helped with a Korean person&rsquo;s business.  </p>
<p>I would rather be beaten up by a stranger for no reasons than physically attack someone for no reasons.  </p>
<p>It broke my heart to read this story and I am extremely disappointed in the guys who had done that.  </p>

		<p>Very well said.  That was a nice apology.</p>
<p>Whenever an Asian asks me that question, I NEVER give the answer he/she wants to hear.  I ALWAYS answer that I am an American.  The ONLY motive for asking such a question is to foment anger, hatred, and violence.</p>
<p>It pains me to say it, but I must say that this Chinese man was VERY FOOLISH to have answered as he did.  I hope he has learned his lesson.</p>
<p>It has been a very long time since the last time a Caucasian person has asked me that question.  I do recall that she was an elderly Caucasian woman who had a prosthetic leg and needed a walker.  When she asked me, I turned the question around and politely asked her, &#8220;You go first.  Where are you from?&#8221;  She was  from a Scandinavian country.  We talked and laughed.  There was no harm done, and there was no fear of any harm to be done.</p>
<p>I always find it puzzling that some Asians, nowadays, feel the need to form gangs.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

		<p>Speaking like a liberal:</p>
<p>&#8220;I reject that any incident took place.  Only whites can be racists.  This was all a misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seriously, what do liberals think when you bring people from a hundred incompatible cultures together in a small place?  They think it becomes some wonderland of kumbaya and vibrancy.  </p>
<p>No, it becomes the tower of babel and everyone at each other&rsquo;s throats.</p>

		<p>Anyone says that East Asians are our model minorities.  While I do agree with that, you must admit that they are the winners in this category solely due to a lack of competition.  This just goes to show you, even if you fill a state, county, or country with Koreans or Libyans or (input any country/race in the world here) that area will become like their homeland.  </p>
<p>If I had to pick between living next to a Somalian or a Korean, I would pick the Korean every time.  But I would prefer a white American.  The Koreans or any other East Asians would not preserve or protect white America&rsquo;s culture or heritage any more than blacks or Mexicans; they would just do it in a less brutal way.  Think about it.</p>

		<p>When you get to know them, it&rsquo;s amazing how much contempt these East Asian ethnic groups have for one another. In Korea, multiple times I heard people refer to Chinese as `inferior`, with a look of disgust on their faces. That it hasn&rsquo;t spilled over other than just a bit of gang violence is surprising. To me it says a lot about the Asian temperament. </p>

		<p>This cannot be a hate crime. Eric Holder the AG [ZANU-PF] said so. Only whitey is possible of perpetrating a hate crime.</p>
<p>Just ask the master Holder AG [ZANU-PF] about this. He will tell you. That man knows all. </p>
<p>In the LA area, the various Oriental groups hate one another. If you put two Orientals in the same jail cell and they are of different Oriental ethnicity, they will immediately fight and try to kill one another.</p>
<p>There is a Korean mafia, and it is related to the Japanese Yakuza. Recently a jewelry store in Monaco was robbed by an armed gang of Koreans [!], thought to be Korean mafia.</p>

<p>You have nothing to apologize for. You are not accountable for or answerable for other members of your race, and what they do is not your responsibility or fault. You cannot apologize for them because you had no connection with their actions. </p>
<p>We need to destroy this false, pernicious and un-American idea that one person can apologize for (or be held liable for) the actions of another person or group of people that he had nothing to do with.</p>

		<p>There was a civil case I read about from my old neighborhood. Bank employee ethnic group A alleged that there was ethnic discrimination at her bank by management and employees who were of ethnic group B. She said they constantly belittled her country of origin. The players? The plaintiff was from Trinidad and the defendants were from Guyana. </p>
<p>I notice something about Caribbean people in general. Guyana and Trinidad both have roughly an even split of Indian and African descent people. Both groups are well represented in NY. Yet in Richmond Hill (now Little Guyana) you barely saw an Afro-Caribbean (mostly in Brooklyn) and it was evident that antagonism between the two was high and well established (the Africans refer to the Indians as &#8220;coolies&#8221;). Now go back to the original story, where the ethic groups are closer together racially. Kind of says something, huh?</p>
<p>The only people who actually believe in and practice multiculturalism are naive yet smug sheltered white liberals. </p>

		<p>This is simply another one of the mainstream media&rsquo;s &#8220;man bites dog&#8221; stories.  The truth of the matter is the percent of Asians in gangs pales in comparison to Hispanics and Blacks.  And from experience, I can tell you that Koreans and Chinese get along about as well as any other two groups of people you can think of.  Again, the story above is the exception rather than the rule.  As far as the &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws being invoked, I think that&rsquo;s so that the authorities can quell the accusations by whites that hate crime laws are only ever used against them (which is still for the most part true).  But I guarantee you if this was a story about Hispanics beating up on a black person (which happens all the time in SoCal), you wouldn&rsquo;t even see the story in print.   </p>

<p>Generally speaking, though the Chinese have more reason to hate others than any ethnic group in the world, they tend to be the least hateful and contemptuous of &#8220;others&#8221;.</p>
<p>Probably because almost no Chinese person (regardless of province, dialect/language) could justify random violence against someone they don&rsquo;t know based on how someone else from the same &#8220;ethnic group&#8221; behaved once or twice.</p>
<p>Those specific Koreans who act that way do so briefly alleviate a severe inferiority complex, which is not something most Chinese people display.</p>

		<p>Well as someone who lived in LA for several years I can assure you that the dislike between Asian groups is more than evident. Koreans look down on Chinese people. Japanese look down on Koreans. Chinese people hate Japanese. Koreans hate Japanese. Japanese hate the other two. I find it funny how people are trying to denny this fact with their comments. The people saying that this conflict doesn&rsquo;t happen often are either not familiar with LA or are just trying to lie to other people to save their Asia pride or whatever they want to call it. <br>

		<p>About 15 years ago a bunch of us were out to lunch at a very good Vietnamese restaurant (Saigon Springs), and one of our party, a fifth-generation American was asked his ethnicity by the (Vietnamese) waitress.  When he answered &#8220;Japanese&#8221; the look of disgust on the face of the waitress was startling.  As someone wrote above, he should have said &#8220;American&#8221;, but of course that would not have answered what the waitress really meant with her question.  In fact, it probably would have irritated him even more.</p>
<p>When asked the same question, I usually give the complete answer: Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, Cherokee and Tuskarora, but for the sake of brevity I sometimes just give &#8220;Celtic&#8221;.  For all intents and purposes I am, except that my fair skin tans more readily than does that of most Scots and Irish; that and the fact that at age 45 I still only have to shave every other day are the only traces of my Amerind background.</p>
<p>Can different east Asian groups tell each other apart?  To some extent, but it varies quite a bit with individuals.  Japanese for instance tend to have only one epicanthic fold per eye and mainland Asians two.  Nose bridges tend to be more pronounced in northeast Asians than with those from the southeast (it&rsquo;s a cold weather adaptation and we Caucasians have large nose bridges for precisely the same reason).  Interethnic Asian hostility is real, but probably overstated in most cases.  Two of my closest friends in Australia were ethnically Chinese.  They were pretty much best friends, but looked quite different.  William had grown up in Australia and spoke with the accent you might expect.  He was also short and fairly dark.  Everett&rsquo;s family had immigrated from Malaysia.  They were constantly making fun of each other, and it was amusing to listen to.  William chided Everett for not being a real Australian, and Everett chided William for not being able to use chopsticks, for being a &#8220;banana&#8221; (yellow on the outside but white on the inside) and for being short and dark (&#8220;Are you sure you&rsquo;re not really an Indonesian?  When did your family shorten your name from Sulaono?&#8221; - Many Indonesian names start with &#8220;Su&#8221; and end with &#8220;no&#8221;.)  Their kidding was good natured, but it was easy for me to see how the subject matter could make for some real unpleasantness among guys who were not friends.</p>
<p>One engineer on loan to us for a joint R&D; project from Matsushita in the 1990s was an ethnic Japanese married to an ethnic Korean.  Socially, things must have been quite unpleasant for them in Japan, because when he was due to be rotated home (which would have involved a nice promotion) he quit his high-paying electrical engineering job at MEC to open a restaurant: quite a step down.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the sort of incident described in the article is quite rare; it seems most of the interasian hostility consists of cultural chauvanism and nothing worse.  It&rsquo;s also fair to point out that international hostility among Europeans used to be quite intense as well.  In the US, the presence of significant numbers of completely non-European nonwhites probably helped cement whites together into a more generalized &#8220;American&#8221; ethnicity, and in Europe the world wars seem to have accomplished pretty much the same thing; there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much future in them fighting each other; not when they&rsquo;re so tragically talented when it comes to war.  In some areas, this hasn&rsquo;t changed much; a quick read on the Balkan wars of 1911 and 1913 compared with the Yugoslav civil war shows that not much has really changed in southeast Europe.</p>

<p>No, they can&rsquo;t.  My wife happens to be a very Asian looking Hispanic/Native American, And Asians are constantly asking her if she is Asian.  </p>
<p><br>
There is a PC myth that Asians are very peaceful and passive people and always have been.  The leftist mantra is now that &#8220;whites started all wars in the world&#8221;&hellip;and unfortunately some people are ignorant enough to believe that. I had to take an Asian studies class in college and it was basically one war after another.  There is a lot of racial hatred between the Japanese, Koreans and Chinese that whites are oblivious to. <br>

		<p>well it is not quite relevant to this AmRen page but, I was reminded of something after I read the comments about the relationship between the neighboring countries in East Asia.  </p>
<p>I recently got to know a guy named David.  He was born in England and he earned his doctorate degree from the University of Cambridge.  He is currently doing a post-graduate degree at University of Toronto.  His student visa is expiring soon, and he is trying to get a job as a professor at University of Toronto or Ryerson University, which is another local university in Toronto where I did my undergraduate at.  If he does get a job, he can stay in Canada for a little more while.  </p>
<p>I cautiously asked him, &#8220;I hope you do not feel offended but, did you watch the movie Braveheart?&#8221; and he said &#8220;Yes, it was a very good movie!&#8221; I felt relieved to know that he was not offended by my question or the movie Braveheart.  &#8220;Ah, I am relieved to know that you did not feel offended by my question or the movie.  I was a bit afraid to ask that question to you because the movie described England in a rather negative way.&#8221;</p>
<p>and he responded, &#8220;The story of the movie was a very long time ago, and the movie exaggerated in a few ways in order to maximize the profit out of the movie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mongols went rather heavily against that characterization. They were indeed impressive warriors, and their exploits hold a great fascination for students of military history. Aggressive, cruel, and militarily brilliant, with a record of conquests that, in less than a century, dwarfed the Indo-Aryan conquests, the Mongols conquered most of Asia and threatened Europe itself before power struggles within their own ranks led to the abandonment of a planned invasion.<br>
They were essentially of the same racial stock as the Chinese, although cultural differences led the Chinese to turn their attention inward for much of their history. That seems to be changing, and an aggressive China will not be good for anyone.</p>

    In my opinion, the Indo-European expansions( conquests?)<br>
    dwarf the Mongol conquests and are far more impressive<br>
    in the duration of linguistic and cultural influence <br>
    on much of Western Eurasia.  </p>
<p>    Indo-Europeans conquered all of Europe, Russia, Central Asia<br>
    and much of the Middle East.   </p>
<p>    The only problem is we dont know how exactly they did it<br>
    due to lack of any historical records.  This expansion took<br>
    place in the pre-historic and in comparison is far more<br>
    impressive.   </p>
<p>    Anyone disagree with my contention?   </p>
