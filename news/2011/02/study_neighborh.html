<p>Study: Neighborhood Natives Move Out When Immigrants Move In</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, DC, February 8, 2011  &mdash;  Native residents of a neighborhood are more likely to move out when immigrants move in, according to new research by three American sociologists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neighborhood Immigration and Native Out-Migration&#8221; appears in the February issue of the American Sociological Review. Study authors are Kyle Crowder of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Matthew Hall of the University of Illinois-Chicago and Stewart E. Tolnay of the University of Washington. </p>
<p>The authors note that for native whites the tendency to leave areas with large and growing immigrant populations appears to be rooted in reactions to the racial composition of a neighborhood. In contrast, decreasing homeownership rates and increasing costs of housing in the neighborhood appear to be the primary impetus for native blacks to leave neighborhoods with large and growing immigrant populations.</p>
<p>However, large concentrations of immigrants in areas surrounding a neighborhood reduce the likelihood that native black and white residents of that neighborhood will leave. The scholars propose that this may be because these surrounding areas, which normally would be the most likely destinations for native householders seeking to relocate, become less attractive to those native householders when they contain larger immigrant populations.</p>
<p>The authors used data from a longitudinal survey of U.S. residents called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics linked to information on neighborhoods drawn from four U.S. Censuses. The research sample included 16,516 native-born, non-Latino white and non-Latino black heads of households from 1968 to 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the settlement patterns of immigrants themselves are important, native-born residents&rsquo; decisions to remain in diversifying neighborhoods or to flee in the face of growing immigrant concentrations are just as crucial in determining the trajectory of residential integration,&#8221; said Crowder, the Howard W. Odum Distinguished Professor of Sociology in UNC&rsquo;s College of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the Carolina Population Center. </p>
<p>&#8220;These findings have important implications for processes of immigrant incorporation, patterns of neighborhood change and broader systems of residential segregation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crowder researches social demography, racial and ethnic stratification, residential mobility and migration, residential segregation, neighborhood dynamics and urban politics and development.</p>
<p>Hall is an assistant professor in the department of sociology and the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois-Chicago. His central research interests are in urban sociology, social demography, migration/immigration and labor markets.</p>
<p>Tolnay is S. Frank Miyamoto Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington. His recent research and publications have focused on the Great Migration of African-Americans. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way it will continue on into the foreseeable future&hellip;at least for the most part&hellip;. until the country will be as it is now, only more so comprised of areas where tribal kinsman congregate in order to be among their own DNA.</p>
<p>I do not believe as some do that we are going to be embroiled in armed conflict in the next 20 years.  If it comes about, it will be later.</p>
<p>However, I do see the country evolving further into a sharp delineation of rich and poor, with the former living in gated, guarded communities while the rabble rule the streets at night, just like Brazil&rsquo;s large cities.</p>
<p>And IF we do have a depression, I think that will hurry things along a bit.  Plus crime of all types will skyrocket in all areas, but urban areas will be so bad as to be declared &#8220;no go&#8221; zones.</p>

		<p>In the UK, these areas where Pakistani / Indian / carribean  immigrants moved in, were referred to as &#8220;twilight&#8221; suburbs.<br>
Simply getting darker as the white neighbours moved on.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_busting" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_busting</a></p>
<p>The findings are old hat among the real estate industry and property speculators.</p>
<p>The economic activity generated by &#8216;busting up&rsquo; settled neighborhoods is in the billions of dollars in goods and services. Having established how easy it is to stir the pot, the government sponsors of mass immigration have been block-busting an entire country with the 1965 Immigration Act.</p>

		<p>Well, when the majority of people around you are speaking a language you don&rsquo;t understand, have breeding pit bulls wandering around just waiting to kill you, your family, and/or your cats, and when you look out your back window in time to see your neighbors murder and dismember a goat and then proceed to roast it over an open fire   &mdash;   this does tend to inspire you to sell out and leave.  When your home turf suddenly belongs to a group you don&rsquo;t relate to at all, you got to get out and go to someplace where your neighbors might be willing to call an ambulance if you keeled over in your front yard.  Just ask almost any white person in SoCA.</p>

		<p>The writer leaves out the obvious question:</p>
<p>Why are whites forced into this situation?  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their country.  No immigrant has a right to move here.  Why is our government bringing people we don&rsquo;t want here?  </p>
<p>I thought this was a government of by and for the people.  </p>
<p>If whites are reacting this way to immigrants, how could anyone conclude that the whites favor having these people brought/allowed in?</p>
<p>Why is it happening?</p>

		<p>White Americans have already been exposed to the racism of non-whites, they are moving out so they don&rsquo;t have to experience more. I guess only sometimes can these scholars can come up with a simple explanation.</p>

		<p>Does anybody - ANYBODY - really need a sociologist to tell us this???  Anyone who&rsquo;s over the age of 40, especially someone who&rsquo;s lived in NYC as I have knows the absolute truth in this.  What it should be referred to as, is White Flight.  I have seen and lived in multiple neighborhoods in NYC and seen the &#8216;For Sale&rsquo; signs go up, and as soon as the point of critical mass is reached, then there&rsquo;s a full-scale exodus of Whites from the area.  I&rsquo;ve seen entire sections of boroughs get all Black, or all Hispanic, or all Korean, etc.  This is almost always at the expense of Whites.  This study only confirms what all of us already know.  That being the case, we need to rely on our own observations, because it is what we see with our own eyes that is the truth, not what we get from the media, not what we get (for the most part) from Academia, and not the lies we get from the government.</p>

<p>Ya think so, Mr. Sociologist?</p>
<p>&#8220;A bleak picture of the corrosive effects of ethnic diversity has been revealed in research by Harvard University&rsquo;s Robert Putnam, one of the world&rsquo;s most influential political scientists. His research shows that the more diverse a community is, the less likely its inhabitants are to trust anyone - from their next-door neighbor to the mayor &hellip;&rdquo; (Financial Times, Oct. 8, 2006)* </p>
<p>Putnam: &ldquo;&hellip;in the presence of diversity, we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it&rsquo;s not just that we don&rsquo;t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don&rsquo;t trust people who do look like us.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Prof. Putnam found trust was lowest in Los Angeles, &#8216;the most diverse human habitation in human history&rsquo; &hellip; When the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, they showed that the more people of different races lived in the same community, the greater the loss of trust.&#8221; </p>

<p>Q, where have you been? these &#8220;urban&#8221; areas, Urban being code talk for black, already ARE no go zones and have been since the mid 70s and only getting worse and worse still when the blacks are muslims. OH! I mean to say they are no go zones especially for Whites, but also dangerous for other civilized thinking people of any color.</p>

		<p>Would be interesting to hear from a dozen or so who fled to find out whether their reasons for leaving were similar.<br>
For instance, were there problems with drug dealing, B&E; crimes to their dwelling, mugging, rape of a neighbor or friend, vandalism, NOISE at all hours&hellip;? <br>
The gravity of their decision to flee may have been a secondary effect of race rather than the news media&rsquo;s favorite dunce - that of the &#8220;typical white person&#8221; harboring racial paranoia based solely on skin color.<br>

		<p>Squeaking as I do as a European immigrant I find the only people who object to me are the dopers on the block. On the other hand I notice that as my neighborhood goes black and Asian so more and more of those moving out, are indeed the &#8220;non immigrants.&#8221; I am feeling the squeeze now, what holds me in are other middle class whites . What will drive me out are the dopers ( all colors,)  I just don&rsquo;t do the perpetual party thing.<br>
I was born in England and my wife in Germany, we feel less and less welcome as the days go by . We speak without an accent, it&rsquo;s culture that makes the difference. When you are the only one checking books out of the library where everyone else checks out videos, you just know something is wrong,  especially when the &#8220;librarian&#8221; makes a verbal note of it.<br>
The states are going to be a mad mix of Brazil and the middle east before long. Not my doing . Don&rsquo;t blame me . I came here to assimilate. Packers won again, har de har.</p>

		<p>Ain&rsquo;t democracy grand.  In so called democratic countries to governments sell out the native population.  When Kuwait was liberated from Iraq one of the first thing the Emir did was evict the &#8220;guest workers&#8221; who turned on their Kuwaiti employers during the occupation.  None of this trying to understand.  Can you imagine if the UK monarch actually had some power and could throw the bums out?  Lord knows our politicians, even the so called &#8220;Republicans&#8221; (think Lindsey), once back in power stab the voters in the back.  Maybe China government isn&rsquo;t so bad, at least they are nationalistic!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very taboo to say diversity isn&rsquo;t good. Publically we all tend to go along with this propaganda to get along. We sure pay the price for it as you know. </p>
<p>Unfortunately no place is safe for long. Any time whites start a community, create good schools, jobs, parks and safe solid infrastructure, it always attracts the other races. These days it doesn&rsquo;t take long to be taken over. The govt is flooding us with masses of people so quickly that there won&rsquo;t be any good places to live unless you are rich. </p>
<p>Sorry everyone, we&rsquo;ve been sold out by the govt. It&rsquo;s the root of the problem. Yeah, write your representative - what a laugh that is.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t need three &#8220;Sociologists&#8221;, or a report, a study, a commission, taxpayer funds, or anything else.  They only needed to ask one person with common sense, a nominal awareness of life, and the ability to speak the truth.</p>

<p>Uh-huh. Because black people are purely incapable of racism, and the Hispanic immigrants do absolutely nothing to the native residents except &#8220;raise housing prices&#8221;. Just ignore the racially motivated gang wars that often go on between blacks and Hispanic immigrants. They&rsquo;re all really just mad about higher housing prices.</p>

		<p>What a bizarre mystery!  There&rsquo;s an English couple down the street from me, but their presence didn&rsquo;t occasion a mass exodus from my neighborhood.  In fact, they&rsquo;re on everybody&rsquo;s social calendar.  Where I used to live a German couple with two small kids moved in across the street; again, nobody rushed to put up FOR SALE signs on their own lots.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, there&rsquo;s a well-to-do black family that&rsquo;s been in our neighborhood for some years now.  I believe the man of the house is a doctor, and while they don&rsquo;t seem to socialize with any of our immediate circle, nobody&rsquo;s rushing around in a state of hysteria, worrying about crashing housing values.</p>
<p>The fact is that in America people of any racial or ethnic group are welcome as long as they adhere to established social norms in terms of behavior, comportment, and decoration.  </p>

		<p>It is an evolving situation and events are playing themselves out in America 2011. We are rapidly moving to an unworkable and dangerous situation in this nation. On the one hand-especially with the very depressing news that nonwhites are majority in the third grade and below-you would think facts such as this and the fact that the US population is  exploding-even without the passage of amnesty-would cause an immediate revolt of millions of Native Born White Americans. Well, it hasn&rsquo;t. and the reason for this is that as bad as things are&hellip;..they aren&rsquo;t bad enough. The pain level will have to increase-and it surely will.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point. The level of pain that triggers the full blown Native Born White American racial revolt is going to be excruciating. But our fellow Native Born White Americans will be completely receptive our White Nationalist message&hellip;.and a big part of this message has to be revising the demographic situation in America. This,of course, will require mass expulsions. Let me tell you something, anyone who thinks the long term survival of Native Born White Americans in the new White Homelands within borders of the former &#8220;America&#8221; is delusional&hellip;.the level of ecological destruction will be so massive in scale that-with very high probability-the White Nation within the former America-and the nonwhites ones that surround it-will collapse. There already have been several shows on the Discovery Channel and the History Channel dealing with this issue. There are actually academics who do research on this for the Pentagon. One of them is at Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are running out of places to flee the blessings of post-1965 racial diversity. The idea of a White Homeland in Montana and Idaho is pure delusional thinking&hellip;ecological constraints will prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>The pitch that White Nationalist-when they go on TV and radio- has to be along the lines of what I have just written..don&rsquo;t pull any punches&hellip;millions of Native Born White Americans are already starting to experience the very nasty consequences of overpopulation&hellip;.and you might want to add into this very scary scenario: amnesty+an increase in Native Born White fertility will create an unbearable and unsustainable situation in the US. This is what we should be telling our fellow Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>They always act like it&rsquo;s inevitable, like these immigrants just fall from the sky and are unavoidable.  This didn&rsquo;t have to happen, and we didn&rsquo;t have to let all these immigrants in.  If whites had had any kind of vote, any kind of say, the vast majority would have said, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t let them in.&#8221;  Everyone talks about &#8220;white flight,&#8221; but nobody talks about how devastating and unfair this is to whites.  I&rsquo;m sure all those whites would have preferred to continue living in their nice, safe communities.  Instead, crime and blight and noise and bad schools and graffiti, etc. etc. came to their towns.  The whites were then forced to pick up stakes, sell their homes, move somewhere else, either switch jobs or endure a longer commute, put their kids in new schools, and on and on.  Nobody goes through all that just because they are an evil bigot who can&rsquo;t stand the color of someone else&rsquo;s skin.  But then&hellip;nobody cares about whites&rsquo; suffering.</p>

		<p>WHITE natives move out when immigrants move in. For the simple reason CRIME RISES with the number of immigrants in the area. But I am sure, this is only a coincidence. After all, haven&rsquo;t we been told time and time again, &#8220;illegal (or even legal) immigrants come here only to better themselves.&#8221; (The reality that bettering themselves should be at OUR expense, being carefully omitted.)</p>

		<p>I recall in college, I was allowed to take one &#8220;easy&#8221; course for graduation. I chose sociology because I thought it would be fun. It&rsquo;s true, it was like filling in coloring books, compared to my other studies. I had to laugh as our textbook reflected on many studies related to &#8220;racism&#8221;. It was always how whites persecuted other races, and never the reverse. There were several photos and illustrations describing how whites are horribly racist towards blacks and others, and that everything is our fault. Surprisingly, the liberal professor was pretty moderate and didn&rsquo;t concentrate too much on this. One afternoon, I was talking with him on the walk to class. He told me that he had studied in Berkeley&hellip;and that it was okay, but there were too many Asians there. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever heard anything so hilarious from a liberal college professor.</p>

		<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, there are some white neighborhoods that won&rsquo;t budge, even though they are in a sea of surrounding black, latino or asian neighborhoods &#8216;in transition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The authors of this study are spot on in their observation that if the areas we might flee to are already overrun, we might as well hunker down.</p>
<p>The trouble is that they have far more children than we do, so our &#8216;neighborhood&rsquo; schools are 90-100% non-white while any white kids basically go to private schools.</p>
<p>As an American who is seeing the loss of my fatherland, I am so confused about what to do.  Is anyone else besides whites giving up their homelands?</p>

<p>Well I&rsquo;m going to go against the grain here. I think you&rsquo;re being too simplistic. Quite frankly many whites do (or did in this case) want immigrants in the country. That is how the civil rights could actually have momentum to begin with. If what you said was true the movement wouldn&rsquo;t have even gotten off the ground do too such a strong collective opposition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in conspiracy theories, although you do make a point that only white countries are the only ones to face such problems. I do believe it has more to do with the high standard of living and that is was 3rd world immigrants want to move here. </p>
<p>We are a super power just starting in decline. Rome faced a similar situation.</p>

<p>White Advocates are going to have to imitate the Russian Dissidents of last century.</p>
<p>They knew that the Soviet System was built on the lies of economic equality and also knew that moving around the various ethnic groups (Chechens, Tatars, etc., ) within the traditionally Russian Ethnic zones would never work.  The historic Russian Nation of people was still there underneath the hegemon of the Soviet System, waiting to get out from underneath!  Alexandr Solzhenitsyn understood all this.</p>
<p>A very similar, almost eerie, situation exists in the contemporary USA today.  The historic White Nation is still here under the Obama/ Federal system, waiting for White Advocates to help them dig themselves out. </p>

		<p>I used to think of white flight as something motivated by irrational color prejudice. The truth is that when whites or Hispanics move into a white working class neighborhood the crime rate goes up. Course work at public schools becomes less demanding or few blacks and Hispanics will graduate. The schools also become dangerous. <br>
 <br>
Upper middle class white liberals are not impacted this way, because the very few blacks and Hispanics who can afford to move to their neighborhoods are exceptional.<br>
 <br>
By suppressing an honest discussion of these problems, and by not addressing them, liberals have caused white blue collar workers to switch allegiance to a political party whose economic policies have contributed to stagnant blue collar wages. </p>

 <br>
This sentence: The truth is that when whites or Hispanics move into a white working class neighborhood the crime rate goes up. <br>
 <br>
Should read this way: The truth is that when blacks or Hispanics move into a white working class neighborhood the crime rate goes up. </p>

		<p>White flee when large numbers of blacks or Hispanic move in because  they fear for their lives and more importantly, their children&rsquo;s. The fact that blacks and Hispanic look at white girls as pieces of meat is enough to make many whites leave. In my city, many brutal crimes against whites committed by blacks and Hispanics have occurred. Rape, murder, home invasion by a gang, robbery, beatings, shooting, stabbing, the list goes on of the atrocities that occur when blacks and Hispanics flood formerly white areas. Add to that the rise in breakins and many whites are on edge when they see non-whites in their neighborhoods. Add to that the racism these invaders have towards us, it&rsquo;s quite understandable that whites leave. Besides, what person in his right mind wants to live in a place where they have to carry weapons at all times and be looking for the next possible threat to come their way for the rest of their lives? White just want to live in peace, without living in fear. That is why they leave, but the government will just keep importing more hostile non-whites whenever whites gather in number to create all white enclaves.</p>
<p>Only I feel soon we will no longer have any place to run to, and we&rsquo;ll be cornered. Just as I taught a couple of very stupid blacks the risks they take when they corner a white man, non-whites are going to pay in blood and guts when they corner whites. Whites are sooner or later going to dig their heels in, then dig in and get weapons ready for the day when they will start killing black and Hispanic attackers. We are going to sooner or later have to fight for a very survival, and this will be a fight that can only have one winner. </p>
<p>White flight is merely part of the run up to the day where whites are going to after suffering excruciating economic, physical and spiritual pain at the hands of the government and non-whites explode into an armed rebellion that will not only be unstoppable, it will spread worldwide. The pain we are in now is great, but before we stand up and fight back physically, enough of us will have to be subjected to so much of that pain, we snap and take matters in our own hands and seize control of our future from our non-white and alien enemies cold, dead dead hands.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Those who believe that economic deprivation causes crime must account for James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein&rsquo;s portrait of an urban community that has suffered severe poverty but little crime. During the 1960s, San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown had the city&rsquo;s lowest income, highest unemployment rate and highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 a year. Yet in 1965, the authors note, there were only five people of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Blacks and Mexicans are merely weapons used against us by someone else.  Whites are brainwashed in schools, TV, music, etc. into allowing these people into their communities.  Until we can figure out who &#8220;they&#8221; are we&rsquo;re just wasting time on a hamster wheel.</p>
