<h1><a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE71C0KX20110213?sp=true">Nearly 1,000 Tunisian Migrants Reach Italy Overnight</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, February 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 1,000 people escaping turmoil in Tunisia landed on an Italian island overnight on Sunday after the government declared a wave of illegal immigrants a humanitarian emergency.</p>
<p>Struggling local authorities called for more support on Sunday to help handle the increasing stream of migrants into Lampedusa, a Sicilian island closer to Africa than mainland Italy, after thousands of arrivals in the past week.</p>
<p>The situation has alarmed Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s government, which proclaimed a humanitarian emergency following a meeting on Saturday, giving authorities extraordinary powers setting aside normal bureaucracy to control migrant flows, in part by blocking incoming boats off-shore.</p>
<p>The interim government running Tunisia since its president was overthrown last month will discuss the issue, but Italy has yet to make direct contact with it about the problem, a government spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>PATROL BOATS</p>
<p>Italy has called for an urgent EU meeting to work out an efficient response and it wants patrol boats stationed near the Tunisian coast to intercept migrants.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Roberto Maroni has blamed the new exodus on Tunisian authorities being unable to enforce bilateral accords on curbing illegal immigration after weeks of protests overthrew President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali last month.</p>
<p>Maroni, a member of the fiercely anti-immigrant Northern League, said earlier this week that there could be &#8220;terrorist infiltrations&#8221; among the migrants and criminals could take refuge in Europe under the guise of seeking political asylum.</p>

		<p>What southern Europe is currently witnessing, depicts the scenario from &#8220;The Camp of the Saints&#8221; at full momentum in real world.</p>
<p>Imagine a march of tens of thousands of African immigrants toward the fortress of Europe, the same way as the Orks marched onto the conquest of Helm&rsquo;s Deep in the second part of &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221;-trilogy. This certainly would give Europeans a freezing shock, but I bet they would not have the stomach to apply defensive measures to keep the hordes out of the fortress, especially Western Europeans. In fact, most would not even acknowledge the masses as invaders, but simply as refugees seeking a better life and thus treat them as such.</p>
<p>Sadly, whites have lost their tribal instinct that puts the protection of their offsprings against intruders at the top of their priority list. The fear of even thinking to be intolerant, racist or violent outweighs their concern for the environmental welfare of their kids, which is why so many whites remain silent and let the car approach the wall at 100 mph without pressing the break. But what is there to talk about kids if most refuse to have any - hence they don&rsquo;t care and continue conducting their spoiled way of life.</p>
<p>I fear that one day, Europe will be just swamped by a tsunami of immigrants from Africa, as their population is exploding in their native countries, creating an immense migration pressure. No government following the revolutions in the Arab world will be capable of providing thousands of jobs to the youth bulge to still their hunger - the laws of Economics and Demographics are merciless. Certainly, Europeans have the technological and military capability to defend their shores and their borders, but they won&rsquo;t be able to penetrate the destructive barrier of political correctness in their heads.</p>
<p>On a positive note: At least Italy has voiced concern and pressured the EU into assistance. I bet if these immigrants arrived at the shores of Sweden, they would be received with open arms.</p>

		<p>For nearly a millennium, ending in 1815 with a slave raid by Barbary pirates on the island of Sardinia, the white nations of the Mediterranean (especially Italy and the Balkans, and to a lesser extent, Spain) were subject to kidnapping expeditions by muslims, resulting in the capture and enslavement of millions - that&rsquo;s right, MILLIONS.  Now, the descendants of these same slavers, pirates and anti-Christians are trying to get into Europe.  To what end?  They should all be put (back) out to sea, and if the Europeans have any sense of survival, should treat these matters as an invasion, which it certainly is. </p>

		<p>Gee, I thought was was going on in Tunisia and Egypt were freedom movements.  If so, why are Tunisians wanting to get out?</p>
<p>Two groups of people are going to be loving this news   &mdash;   One, the radical Islamists already entrenched in Europe, who will look forward to increased numbers of Muslims in Europe, and Two, lamestream left wing parties all over Europe, who will gladly accept the votes.</p>

		<p>First the good news:</p>
<p>1.  These people are largely Berbers which is to say only a little more dusky than your average southern Italian.  Ethnically, they could make it, &#8216;breeding in&rsquo; on the Peninsula, if they had any skills.  They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>2.  These people pay upwards of 1,500 Euros (2,000 U.S. dollars) to smugglers to bring them to Lampedusa which is only about 70 miles offshore from Africa.  They are not starving, yet.  You could send them home and tell them to ask for a refund.</p>
<p>Now the bad news:</p>
<p>A.  Interior Minister Maroni thinks this is like the Berlin Wall scenario.  It&rsquo;s not.  The Eastern Europeans were whiter than we were when the Warsaw Pact fell.  Smarter and prettier in many ways too, they had not been polluted by two and a half decades of forced multiculting.</p>
<p>B.  The Italians won&rsquo;t shoot on sight and won&rsquo;t give up Lamedusa as a springboard of mandatory asylum &#8216;paper checking&rsquo; to would be migrants.</p>
<p>C.  The Tunisians have &#8216;categorically refused&rsquo; to let the Italians help them keep their prisoners and malcontents in Tunis (It is believed up to half of the nations jails were emptied by the revolution.).  Which makes me think more of Cuba than Germany.</p>
<p>D.  It&rsquo;s not 1,000 anymore.  By late Sunday it was 1,400 and growing.  Rome is calling it &#8216;a biblical exodus&rsquo;.  There are only about 6,000 on all of Lampedusa anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>Folks, this is what happens when idiot socialists encourage revolution in oppressive but stable dictatorships.  A week after the last stolen liquor is consumed, people wake up and notice they are STILL poor and STILL huntry.  And start looking overseas for the next party.</p>
<p>When Serbia did her little ethnic cleansing, avoiding the consequences we are seeing here was a large part of our justification for Operation Allied Force, back in 1999.</p>
<p>It was wrong then because it was not a _NATO_ problem (and the KLA were really thugs) while and simply population flipping a couple districts would have vastly improved the safety of each Serb and Muslim group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary now.  Because these are NOT Europeans.  And if Europe won&rsquo;t defend her sovereignity by making local North African populations fear her more than they fear their own lack of resources, we will see _The Camp Of The Saints_ made real.</p>
<p>Even if Italians are willing to become even less white and more culturally impoverished in the process, certainly their economy cannot afford to be very generous.  Next to Greece, they have the sickest debt ratio in Europe right now.</p>
<p>If you won&rsquo;t reproduce with someone (and the Tunisias are all highly Arabized), whatever they take from your culture as socio economic status improvement will be _forever lost_ to you.</p>
<p>If their appearance or their mannerisms throws you off investing in their genes, don&rsquo;t invite them to stay.  It really is that simple.</p>

		<p>Now this gets me on a personal level since all my family is from Italy (Sicily to be exact).  But Italy was the forebears against political correctness in Western Europe.  A few blacks land there and demand asylum and work and set a car on fire, four hours later there are hundreds of Italian natives chasing them swinging bats!  They are very ethnocentric in Italy and hate foreigners, about half do not accept me even though all four of my grandparents were born there, I speak the language fluently, and my immediate family owns land and part of a few family businesses there.  With that being said I see the people of Italy not taking this sitting down, like they never have in the past.  It really makes me wonder because if a black person walks around a city in Italy locals will yell at them, tell them to go home, and throw things at their head even if they are an American tourist!  It really makes me think how bad their real countries are to want to put up with that.  I even told a black coworker not to visit Venice.  When she returned I got to tell her &#8220;Told you so!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think the Italian government should repatriate these Tunisians back to Tunisia, ASAP. It&rsquo;s not like these people are the victims of religious persecution, since Islam is the official religion of Tunisia, and these people are Moslems.</p>
<p>Italy is for Italians, not Tunisian carpetbaggers. Besides, didn&rsquo;t these people want regime change in Tunisia, to begin with?</p>
