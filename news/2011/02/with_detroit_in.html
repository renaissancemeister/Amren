			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, February 8, 2011</i></p>

<p>But his [Mayor Dave Bing&rsquo;s] eyes were focused on the grim details of the city&rsquo;s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. Page 25: The annual budget is in the hole by $155 million. Page 28: Long-term debt has climbed to $5.7 billion. Bing tapped the 237-page document with his index finger, number after daunting number.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was elected, I thought I knew what was going on, but I got here and found out [that] in the short term, things were way worse than I ever imagined,&#8221; Bing said. &#8220;Financially. Ethically. From a policy standpoint. We were on the brink of a financial calamity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Bing has issued an open invitation: anyone with a proposal, plan, theory  &mdash;  a notion, even  &mdash;  is welcome to try to save his crumbling city.</p>
<p>Numerous outfits have responded, turning Detroit into the new New Orleans  &mdash;  a giant testing ground for urban planners and developers.</p>
<p>There is an urban farming proposal, which would turn over whole sections of the city to corporate farming operations. Many of the country&rsquo;s leading foundations, including Kresge, Ford, Rockefeller, Kellogg, Skillman and Knight, are funding arts, education and development projects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bing announced a plan on Monday to encourage city police officers and firefighters to live in Detroit as a way of bolstering neighborhoods. Using federal dollars and deals with local banks, the city would offer homes for as little as $1,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mayor has, so far, made no commitments. At this point, he just wants residents to face facts. Such as: He cannot afford to send water, garbage trucks and other services to large parts of his city. And: There are so few ambulances that some people have been transported in city-owned sedans. Plus: Last summer, the wheels and rims were stolen off Bing&rsquo;s GMC Yukon security vehicle and it was left on blocks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Sense of urgency</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a recent trip to Washington to attend the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Bing sat near the front of the room as retiring Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley passed along wisdom gained during his 22 years in office. &#8220;The idea that we come down to Washington, and they have all this money, it&rsquo;s wrong,&#8221; Daley said. &#8220;Those days are over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bing clapped &#8216;amen&rsquo; to that, but he continues to pursue federal programs that could benefit Detroit. &#8220;As much as we can get  &mdash;  always,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Creating a plan</b></p>
<p>Late last year, Bing held his first round of community listening sessions for his Detroit Works Project, which will eventually produce a master plan for the city. There was a lot of yelling and many questions about whether people would be forced to move out of their homes if their neighborhoods are shuttered. Bing promises no forced relocation.</p>
<p>But memories remain of two black neighborhoods, Black Bottom and Paradise Valley, that were demolished when the city built the Chrysler Freeway.</p>

		<p>New Orleans isn&rsquo;t such a good model.  The head coach of the Saints, who just a year ago was hoisting the Lombardi Trophy for the city, is moving his family to Dallas, while he maintains an apartment in New Orleans.  This is something he wanted to do starting at the beginning of last season, but the team&rsquo;s owner talked him out of it because of Katrina pity.  Evidently, Sean Payton&rsquo;s big worry was that he wanted his family to live in a good suburban neighborhood where there are good public schools (translation:  white), whereas he had to spring for private school tuition when they were all in New Orleans, and the rumors are that he didn&rsquo;t think even that private/Catholic schools in NO were that good, either.</p>
<p><i>Bing announced a plan on Monday to encourage city police officers and firefighters to live in Detroit as a way of bolstering neighborhoods. Using federal dollars and deals with local banks, the city would offer homes for as little as $1,000.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;As little as&#8221; a grand?  I thought that was the average price for Detroit real estate.  If Bing wants to get on the good side of cops, he could try something really radical, like not putting a convicted murderer on the Board of Police Commissioners.</p>
<p>Residency rules for police and first responders in big cities is a roundabout form of racial affirmative action on the margins.  The reason Detroit cops don&rsquo;t have to live in Detroit city is because the state did away with residency rules about ten years ago.  The state can go one step further, and adopt the Missouri rule for big city police departments   &mdash;   The Governor appoints all but one of Detroit&rsquo;s Police Commissioners, the Mayor is the other one ex officio.  While Michigan&rsquo;s current Governor, big time outsourcer Bill Snyder, or its previous Governor, Jennifer Granholm, or most of the predecessors, are not much to write home about, they certainly wouldn&rsquo;t send a convicted murderer to the Detroit BOPC.  And a Republican Governor would make an occasional good appointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is an urban farming proposal, which would turn over whole sections of the city to corporate farming operations&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of that land available for farming, or thought to be, has too much industrial pollution and contamination to be suitable?</p>
<p>Let the place continue to revert to nature, create a nature preserve, remove the folks! There are some big ideas.</p>

		<p>Big Thinking Needed, this sounds like a job for that Caped Crusader Al Sharpton and his NAACP buddies?</p>
<p>They ran the whites out of Detroit they control it and even a blind man could see what they have done with it.</p>
<p>I am sure there must be an intelligent black somewhere? I guess  I just  haven&rsquo;t been lucky enough to meet him or her?</p>
<p>They may need to go back to black basics, start crying about slavery and demanding more cash.<br>
If you sell used Escalades or Newport Smokes you will be glad to see their hard earned money?</p>
<p>EVERY race has good and bad points BUT the blacks need to accept the fact that they really can&rsquo;t make it on their own and start showing a little more respect to real producers and taxpayers?</p>

China, or other foreign countries, that could then deport the<br>
unwanted, unqualified, unproductive, criminal, dangerous, and otherwise useless, back to the remaining places in the USA that still find them worth supplying free food and housing to with nothing in return.<br>

		<p> &#8220;He&rsquo;s now applying for a $40,000 grant for a beautification project in the Brightmoor neighborhood. &#8220;There&rsquo;s over a million dollars a year now for public art in Detroit.&#8221; &#8220;</p>
<p>Only the fertile black brain could conceive this. No electricity or water in parts of the city but a million bucks for public art.<br>

		<p>DETROIT SHOULD BECOME AMERICA&rsquo;s WEST BANK AS A HOMELAND FOR ENDANGERED WHITE PEOPLE.</p>
<p>We could turn it into an economic power house and haven for displaced white people looking for a better life.  We would even pay to have the Statue of Liberty moved to the Motor City.</p>
<p>How much would it cost to purchase the entire city of Detroit?  Most of it is gutted so now is the time to buy it.  It would be a place where prayers could be said in school every morning.</p>

		<p>Seeing the Superbowl ad about Detroit only made me firmer in my commitment to buy a new car built in our home state of Alabama. Our old Chrysler product is on its last leg. We will soon be buying a new Mercedes, Honda or Hyundai in Alabama. A little over 10 years ago Alabama had no automotive industry. Without federal aid or union thugs, we were able to attract and develop our own auto industry. We now produce over a million vehicles a year. Our production capacity is about 25% of that of Michigan and when C Class Mercedes production comes on line in a couple of years here in Tuscaloosa, it will be even higher. Our local Mercedes plant has a payroll in excess of $2-million per day that will soon double.</p>
<p>The old traditional American automotive industry has never done a single thing for Alabama except take our money and turn up their noses. If Chrysler, GM, or Ford wants to build plants in Alabama, then come on down. You&rsquo;ll get the same incentives our local manufacturers received. but until you do, you won&rsquo;t get my business.</p>

		<p>Of course the problems of Detroit will never be solved, because the real causes of its problems have been declared &#8220;off-limits&#8221; for discussion, but the idea of turning vast parts of it over to farmland or forest preserve seems to be the most realistic option at this point.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a big idea: pay any and every citizen of Detroit (excluding post-menopausal women) $20,000 to get sterilized. If they have children, pay them $3,000 less for each child they have, bottoming out at $1,000 for someone with 7 children or more.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another plan––pay every resident of Detroit $20,000 to renounce their US Citizenship and go to another country in the African diaspora, such as Jamaica, Ghana, Somalia etc.</p>
<p>What do you think, readers?</p>

<p>Case one:<br>
After 20 years &#8220;suddenly&#8221; Detroit will get rich and liberals will try to explain with the good work of the NAACP.</p>
<p>Case two:<br>
In Germany the communist leader of Berlin tried to get gypsies out this way. What happened was exactly what the &#8220;bigotries &#8221; had said before would happen: They took the money and didn&rsquo;t leave.</p>

		<p>No surprise here. I knew Bing&rsquo;s idea of &#8220;revitalizing&#8221; Detroit was to go hat in hand to Washington DC, and beg Uncle Sam for federal largesse. Only that won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Bing is in over his head as Mayor of Detroit, and he knows it. He was able to sell himself as an NBA jock, but compared to being mayor of Detroit, guarding the likes of John Havlicek was easy.  </p>

		<p>Soviet Republic of New Jersey (#8), Detroit is gone FOREVER.  The reason the smart money is running from the place is because, in addition to Blacks, there are HUGE numbers of Muslims moving in, as well as HUGE numbers of Hispanic Illegal Aliens.</p>
<p>These numbers are sloppy approximations: but the city, now, is roughly one-third Black Welfare Recipients, one-third Muslim, and one-third Hispanic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last place on earth suitable for a White Homeland.  And who needs that stinkin&rsquo; Statue of Liberty, anyway?</p>
<p>And as for commercial farming operations, who would want to eat food grown on that soil?  Detroit, surely, has some of the most toxin-laden soil anywhere.</p>

<p>Jack responds:</p>
<p>Yes, I am sure that German automobile companies in Alabama that employ White Alabama workers will produced very good cars and help the Alabama economy do well.</p>
<p>But, please, PLEASE do not fall in for the anti union, high cost labor is the problem, let big business do whatever it wants  - trap.</p>
<p>Big business - except for some racially loyal Japanese CEOS, some Swiss billionaires will always ALWAYS work to bring in cheaper NW, non union workers. Detroit was a very White union town until Henry Ford and other Auto business leaders allowed cheaper Black African workers from the South to be used as strike breakers and eventually they stayed on and the rest is Detroit history.</p>
<p>I know that many if not most Amren readers started out as &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; and accepted &#8220;free market economics&#8221; as the American way - it&rsquo;s not.  Our White race needs to be protected.</p>
<p>Yes we are &#8220;Protectionist&#8221; - we need to lock the doors of our homes and not let all kinds of people come in and out. We need to lock down our borders and keep out tens of millions of NWs who could certainly find employment in Alabama working for 50% less than White workers in the auto industry there.</p>
<p>California went from being the most prosperous, beautiful state to the hell that it is now, thanks in no small part from large White owned agribusinesses that wanted endless supplies of cheap NW labor - it was supposed to be &#8220;good for business&#8221; good for California. </p>
<p>The same was said about Black African slave workers in the South. None of this $*%&# would have happened if you folks had picked your own cotton.</p>

		<p>Many of the country&rsquo;s leading foundations, including Kresge, Ford, Rockefeller, Kellogg, Skillman and Knight, are funding arts, education and development projects. </p>
<p>All of them WHITE foundations I imagine! It amazes me that White liberals continue to throw good money after bad, must have to do with tax write offs or something, that&rsquo;s all I can figure. It also continues to amaze me that with all the wealthy blacks in this country, none of them EVER fund anything like this. I heard that Al $harpton rides around in a $300,000 Rolls Royce, the &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright just bought a multi million dollar house in a gated &#8216;racisss&rsquo; White neighborhood, that would certainly help fund some of these &#8220;projects&#8221;. They may fund some little &#8220;community cehter&#8221; [ thug hang-out ] or clean up some ghetto park [ which was trashed BY the thugs ], but thats about it. Maybe they know its a lost cause. More than likely though its always &#8216;mo bedda&rsquo; when its Whiteys money, &#8220;let Whitey pay fo it, day da ones got us in dis mess in da fers place!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;It&rsquo;s open season,&#8221; said Chazz Miller, an artist and entrepreneur in Detroit who was handed a $15,000 grant from the Knight Foundation  &mdash;  </p>
<p>Oh give it a break &#8220;Chazz&#8221;, you&rsquo;re nothing more than a entrepreneur at being a CON artist! Soon, if not already, he&rsquo;ll be driving around in a new Benz and living in a &#8216;racisss&rsquo; White neighborhood with this &#8220;grant&#8221; money!</p>
<p> The key is what change will really look like,&#8221; said Donna Harris, director of a neighborhood community development corporation.</p>
<p>Translation: We want Whitey to pay for all this &#8220;change&#8221;, but it has to remain a &#8220;chocolate city&#8221; with &#8220;chocolate people&#8221; in charge.<br>
Someone needs to ask Ms. Donna how long shes been the &#8220;director of a neighborhood community development corp.&#8221; and what &#8220;changes&#8221; she herself has made through the years to better the &#8220;community&#8221; to substantiate her job. She sounds like part of the problem to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not that we dislike change. We dislike being changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like Ms. Donna likes Detroit just as it is. The Whites that were run out of Detroit &#8220;disliked being changed&#8221; also and   were labeled racists for saying so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the real goal to, in one fell swoop, clear significant portions of land that can then be turned over to developers, and then you can turn over the entire ethnic typography of the city?&#8221; asked Horace Sheffield III, president of a coalition of black organizations. </p>
<p>Yeah &#8220;Horace Sheffield III, president of a coalition of black organizations&#8221; thats usually how it works, the people that PURCHASE the land have the right to DEVELOP it as they see fit, with-in reason. Not that you would know this &#8220;Horace&#8221; but I would imagine they think they&rsquo;d have a higher return building retail\business centers and medium to high end housing for people that actually CONTRIBUTE to society over roach motel high maintenance public housing, barber shops, liquor stores, chitlin shacks and nail salons.</p>
<p> Look folks with people like Ms Donna &#8220;director of a neighborhood community development corporation&#8221; and Horace Sheffield III, &#8220;president of a coalition of black organizations&#8221;, is it any wonder why Detroit is as it is? </p>

		<p>I think commenter number 8 has a great idea, make it a separate homeland for us displaced whites. In less than a generation we could make it a paradise beyond the imagination of the current occupants.</p>
<p>  Another idea would be to declare it a tax free type of land, like the Cayman Islands, and let banks and investors base their business there. Entrepreneurs and private enterprise are the only means to bring this city back to life. Public art is not the way to prosperity&hellip;.

		<p>$1000 for a home in Detroit? Those cops and firemen are being ripped off big-time. Many homes in the Murder City are listed for $1.</p>
<p>I sure hope Sean Payton did his homework in relocating his family. The black-infested part of Dallas (mainly south of I-30) is &#8220;Detroit on the Trinity.&#8221; Like Detroit, well over half of the city&rsquo;s policemen and firefighters live in the suburbs (as do nearly 40% of all other city employees) because Texas has never allowed residency rules.</p>
<p>Like &#8220;TTownTony&#8221; (#9), I found the Chrysler ads ridiculous, bordering on disgusting. Having Eminem   &mdash;   a textbook example of the pejorative term &#8220;w*****r&#8221;   &mdash;   endorsing any product is the equivalent of hiring Charles Manson or OJ Simpson as spokesman for kitchen cutlery. IMHO the phrase &#8220;imported from Detroit&#8221; simply confirms the city&rsquo;s status as a Third World pool. Seeing our bailout dollars spent in this manner is further proof that Chrysler is a hopeless basket case that should have been allowed to go under.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing so predictable as one person eagerly deflating anothers idea without offering one of their own.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t pretend to know whats best for Detroit, but &#8216;predatory capitalism&rsquo; is clearly not what I had in mind. My thought was merely to find a way to foster private enterprise, composed entirely of like minded whites working together, free of the shackles of leftist, do-gooder politics and their resultant costs.  As for the straw man of ADL or SPLC hiding their money in such a place, spare me.  You honestly think that you can prevent their accumulation or hiding of wealth by leaving that festering vacant land as it is? Moreover, who cares what they do!  My thought was not limited to banking alone, but industry, or any other business model that would benefit from being there. You mean an area of low taxes, pro business climate and a high IQ workforce is a bad idea? Or you prefer to discuss the sour grapes beyond your reach? </p>
<p>You missed my greater point in your eagerness to tear down my initial thoughts. Such a place would be an unapologetic, pro white, pro capitalist place, where the cultural standards of borders, language and culture would be defined as most all of us here would define them. Morality would have a place, more so than it does in our current culture.  Starting from scratch would mean we would have the  ability to decide many of the parameters that hamper social and economic success. As for who would cut the grass or wash the dishes, I will leave those details to others, but certainly if we can transplant human organs and go to the moon, our people could find ways to be wildly successful if left to our own devices. Would you not agree? </p>

		<p>In just a few years of WW2, many European cities were deliberately devastated by bombs, fire, shelling and gunfire. London, Coventry, Berlin, Dresden and Stalingrad are a well known few. All these cities have now been rebuilt. Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced Atomic Bombs but the next day, the inter-city trains to and from Hiroshima were operating. There are no European cities anywhere that have simply being abandoned to rot and be regularly looted and torched by their own citizens over a period of several decades. No American city was bombed during WW2 and the economy along with the lifestyle of citizens blossomed. In 1842 Haiti suffered a massive earthquake and during international relief operations following the 2010 quake, much evidence of the damage from the first was still evident. Wonderful cities built by Europeans all over Africa and under control of Black Africans for the past 50 or 60 years are, just like Detroit, simply falling to pieces with Blacks content to squat in the ruins. The transport of Black African slaves to work the cotton and tobacco plantations of USA was obviously a huge mistake. At that time, there were many thousands of White farmers, smiths, carpenters and similar skilled or even unskilled labour in Britain who would have jumped at the chance for free passage to America to work the fields for no pay, build their own homes, grow their own veg patch and raise chickens &amp; pigs. It&rsquo;s a sure bet that within the first year, these innovative people would have invented easier ways to pick and process cotton and so benefited themselves and their temporary masters. There would have been no civil war. Ah, but it&rsquo;s too late now. The genie is out of the bottle and is too numerous and well-fed to put back. In Haiti, the population burns it&rsquo;s own people as witches for spreading disease whilst queuing for free cholera shots and content to stand ankle deep in their own slowly flowing human sewage. As for turning over huge tracts of Detroit into farmland or a nature reserve, there is no need to give the corrupt black politicians any grant, aid or investment money. Just leave it alone for the next few years and it will continue to revert to nature as it already is doing. According to the Pigford case, there are thousands of experienced and willing black farmers who now have compensation money with which to start up with all this free land, Yessiree.. FREE.. that one little word that always gets the attention of any black!</p>

		<p>To Yorkshireman (re post # 23):</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget Australia, which, of course, was used by the British as a penal colony and was built up by white convicts, since the 18th century. At the same time, the aborigine population never built a permanent structure in Australia, and continued hunting and shooting wildlife with spears and blowguns. They still do, today.</p>
<p>In the case of Stalingrad, did you know that Winston Churchill wanted Stalin to let Stalingrad lie in ruins, as a &#8220;memorial&#8221; to the destructiveness of war? Stalin, to his credit, refused to go along with that stupidity, and rebuilt Stalingrad (now Volgograd).</p>
