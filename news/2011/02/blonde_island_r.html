<h1>Blonde Island Resort In Maldives Planned By Lithuanian Firm</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liudas Dapkus, Huffington Post, February 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Olialia (pronounced Oh-la-LA) has created a business empire in Lithuania, using its troupe of glitzy models with platinum hair to market just about anything from potato chips to pop music. There&rsquo;s Olialia pizza and Olialia cola, even Olialia computers.</p>
<p>With the Maldives resort  &mdash;  and plans for an airline linking it to the Baltic republic  &mdash;  Olialia is taking its blond ambition to a new level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blond is light. It attracts people like sunshine,&#8221; brand manager Lauryna Anuseviciute, a 24-year-old former model, explained at the Olialia office in downtown Vilnius.</p>
<p>In Lithuania, where a big chunk of the population shares Anuseviciute&rsquo;s light hair color  &mdash;  naturally or aided by peroxide  &mdash;  such unabashed glorification of blond beauty doesn&rsquo;t raise many eyebrows.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how the Olialia concept will be received in the Maldives, a more ethnically diverse archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which requires foreign developers to hire at least 50 percent local staff.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No need, according to Anuseviciute. &#8220;Staff who are not blond will wear a blond wig to make everyone look similar,&#8221; she said. The wig will be considered part of their uniform.</p>
<p>Approximately 65 percent of the staff will be women, she said.</p>
<p>The resort plans are still in their infancy  &mdash;  the tentative launch date is 2015  &mdash;  but Anuseviciute insisted Olialia already has secured financing.</p>
<p>Still, it won&rsquo;t miss a good chance to promote the project, like at next month&rsquo;s international real estate fair in Cannes, France. Olialia plans to arrive in style, with 130 blondes flying in from Lithuania on a chartered plane.</p>
<p>Back home, the small women&rsquo;s rights movement is cringing in disgust. Not only is the &#8220;blond island&#8221; idea demeaning to women, but borderline racist, said Margarita Jankauskaite, director of the Lithuanian Center for Equality Advancement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ashamed that this initiative came from my country. This only sends a message to the world that Lithuania is a country of cheap beer and cheap <br>

&hellip; and of course they don&rsquo;t ask the normal people but directors of institutions, which is their to find those things bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s is like talking to anti-alcohol organizations how they think about alcohol, and than do like it would be the common opinion - or better, the opinion you need to have to be a good human being.</p>

		<p>This really upsets me. I always thought central/eastern Europeans still possessed their sanity, and to a very large extent they still do so. But to send young White women off on their own to a nonwhite and muslim island in the middle of the Indian Ocean is CRIMINAL. </p>
<p>I pray something derails this plan indefinitely.</p>

<p>But when blacks want to start their own exclusionary organization, you&rsquo;ll notice the MSM never quotes anybody as saying <i>that&rsquo;s</i> &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think that rich Arabs and Indians will swarm the Island and there will be a drive to marry up every blonde on staff.  That is, the ones that aren&rsquo;t already dating a Maldivian male.  This will require yet more Lithuanian women to come. When they run out, Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, etc., will be recruited.  It will go on until every last blonde in Europe has been devoured.  Outlandishly paranoid as it sounds, this seems possible to me.</p>
<p>Yet there is hope.  The Maldives was where that big tsunami hit in 2004.  It has lots of problems.  It seems that the Maldives are threatened by flooding due to global warming.  Just read this copy and paste from the Wiki article on the Maldives;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last century, sea levels have risen about 20 centimetres (8 in);[20][21] further rises of the ocean could threaten the existence of Maldives, being the lowest country in the world, with a maximum natural ground level of only 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in), with the average being only 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level. Current estimates place sea level rise at 59 centimetres (23 in) by the year 2100. However, around 1970, the sea level there dropped 20–30 centimetres (8–12 in).[22] In November 2008, President Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to look into purchasing new land in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia because of his concerns about global warming and the possibility of much of the islands being inundated with water from rising sea levels. The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism.[23] The President has explained his intentions:</p>
<p>    &#8220;We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades&#8221;.[24]</p>
<p>On 22 April 2008, then Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom pleaded for a cut in global greenhouse gas emissions, warning that rising sea levels could submerge the island nation of Maldives.[25][26]<br>
[edit] Marine ecosystem&#8221;</p>
<p>But since American conservatives KNOW that Global Warming is a farce, I guess the plan will go forward.</p>

<p>Sorry if I&rsquo;m going against the current, but am I to assume that they were forced to go or they went due to financial reasons; even better, for adventure of &#8220;diverse&#8221; cultures?</p>

<p>No, Maldives is SINKING, like many islands, it&rsquo;s not the ocean rising. Liberals just love to blame everything on global warming.</p>
<p>What i find exceedingly disgusting, is the modern focus on mating blonde white women with blacks, or dark haired non-whites. Do they not understand that their beauty derives from genetics? and that miscegenation destroys it?</p>
