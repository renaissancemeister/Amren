			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Harrison, Telegraph (London), February 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A family of &#8220;travellers&#8221; with 12 children are to be moved into their twelfth home in 12 years following a string of complaints by neighbours.</p>
<p>They have been called the &#8220;anti-social climbers&#8221;  &mdash;  families who behave badly, have more children and are moved on up the property ladder at the taxpayer&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>Families whose behaviour makes life a misery for their neighbours can be thrown out of their social housing, but the authorities must rehouse them  &mdash;  in a bigger home, if they have had more children  &mdash;  and the process can start all over again.</p>
<p>In one of the most astonishing cases, a family of &#8220;travellers&#8221; with 12 children are to move into their 12th home in 12 years.</p>
<p>Tanya Welch, 39, and her partner Tom O&rsquo;Leary, 42, have been served an eviction notice on a £1.2m house in a prosperous area of north London, where they were placed as tenants by the local council.</p>
<p>Since the family, who receive more than £70,000 a year in state benefits, moved into the five-bedroom semi in Muswell Hill just over a year ago residents have complained about verbal abuse, theft, litter, noise, late-night rows and children out on the streets at all hours.</p>
<p>It was a similar story at previous homes. The Sunday Telegraph has established the family was moved out of its last two addresses after neighbours complained about their anti-social behaviour.</p>
<p>In total, Haringey council has housed them in four &#8220;permanent&#8221; homes and seven temporary ones  &mdash;  including B&B; accommodation  &mdash;  since 1999.</p>
<p>Under the law, tenants evicted for antisocial behaviour are considered &#8220;intentionally homeless&#8221;, with no automatic right to be rehoused.</p>
<p>However, if there are children in the household then the council must find temporary accommodation for the whole family  &mdash;  parents and children  &mdash;  and then help them to find a permanent home.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians called on Labour-run Haringey to stop moving the O&rsquo;Leary family around the borough and causing misery to more residents.</p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2005 they were placed in a rented three-bedroom terraced house, now valued at around £340,000, in Vincent Road, Wood Green.</p>
<p>Neighbours there said the behaviour of &#8220;the gipsy family&#8221;, as they were known, was so bad that they signed a petition and complained to the council and local MP to have them removed.</p>
<p>The family were then moved to their next &#8220;permanent&#8221; home, a £400,000 three-bedroom terrace in Fairfax Road, in an area known as the &#8220;Harringay Ladder&#8221; because of the street pattern in the area. They lived there from 2006 to 2010, leaving the house in need of thousands of pounds of repairs.</p>
<p>Here too, residents describe the misery inflicted by the travellers and their relief when they were finally moved on.</p>
<p>One said: &#8220;The police were always around, there was always something going on. There was a lot of threats and verbal abuse. People didn&rsquo;t want to take them on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year the family was moved on to a large Edwardian house in Dukes Avenue, Muswell Hill, a well-heeled suburb with celebrity residents and houses valued at up to £3 million.</p>
<p>The neighbours, alarmed by the family&rsquo;s behaviour, hired a solicitor, formed a neighbourhood watch, signed a petition demanding the family&rsquo;s removal and sent Haringey council a dossier of 28 complaints. The travellers allegedly responded by shouting &#8220;rich b  &mdash;    &mdash;  &#8221; at them.</p>
<p>Last week, the council served them with an eviction notice. If, as expected, the family resists the eviction order, the matter will be resolved by a magistrates court.</p>
<p>But even if that is successful, the council will, under the law, almost certainly have to provide them with new accommodation.</p>
<p>Cllr Richard Wilson, the from the opposition Liberal Democrats, said: &#8220;Haringey council has clearly decided to push this family from pillar to post rather than tackling the root cause of the problems they may have.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has meant that more residents, in different areas of the borough, have had to put up with the disturbances caused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong action is needed against disruptive tenants but I have yet to see evidence to suggest that the council has tried to come to a long-term solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Welch, who calls herself &#8220;Gipsy T&#8221; and is pregnant with her 13th child, due next month, describes her &#8220;sporting interests&#8221; on the internet as &#8220;eating chocolate and having kids&#8221;.</p>
<p>Her profile on the internet auction site eBay reads: &#8220;Ime a proud mum who formes part of the Irish travelling community; of wich I am veary pleased to be part off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just love travelling!&#8221;</p>
<p>The site shows she has paid more than £1,000 for a crib, as well as dozens of items of Royal Crown Derby china, a vintage pink baby doll nightie and an Art Deco Romany fortune-telling tea-cup.</p>
<p>Last week she said that she would prefer to be housed on a caravan park, preferably somewhere with no neighbours.</p>
<p>Haringey council said it was &#8220;unable to confirm or deny&#8221; that the family had been evicted from their previous &#8220;permanent&#8221; homes because of anti-social behaviour.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;We have served a notice to the family that we will be seeking possession of the premises and are urgently deciding what further action is needed, given we have a legal duty of care to the children, and an obligation to any neighbours who have suffered at the hands of the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to work with the family to try to find the best solution for all concerned.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Those &#8216;parents&rsquo; don&rsquo;t care and they never will. They shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to be parents. They&rsquo;ve found a way to survive, off of everyone else, through their children that they&rsquo;ve manipulated. </p>
<p>Kids need a foundation and direction. Moving is a huge life change for anyone, but the kids must be really out of their minds. </p>
<p>The parents need &#8216;tough love&rsquo; from the system. Back them into a corner and make them think and do for themselves. </p>
<p>Put the children in some type of foster care. Maybe 1 out of 12 might get lucky with some good adoptive parents and be straightened out.  </p>
<p>With the parents childless, let them hang themselves, being &#8216;rehabilitated&rsquo; by the system. They&rsquo;ll wind up being paid for one way or another, at least now not through the kids.</p>

		<p>     Just to make it clear,these are not Roma Gypsies. They are white trash. In Britain The term gypsy is not a racial or ethnic description but a lifestyle description. A gypsy can be white or Roma.In Britain the term gypsy when used alone is usually referring to a white of Irish heritage that has low ethics in general and usually impoverished. It is noteworthy that White and Roma gypsies have very similar predicaments which many claim is proof that its them and not society that causes their poverty.<br>
      Traveler is also used instead of gypsy sometimes and is interchangeable. Due to the fact that they never seem to set permanent roots as demonstrated in this article. However, if a certain clan does not travel they may still be described as gypsy or traveler because of their poor social ethics. Here in USA rednecks or white trash could very likely be described as a Traveler or Gypsy by someone from Britain. <br>
      They are viewed upon by their fellow citizens much like we would view inner city blacks or loud mouthed obnoxious unreliable whites.<br>
     Simply put, they are a sub ethnic group that is defined not by their difference in race or religion but by their anti-social and self destructive culture.</p>

<p>passerby; I have objected to the use of the term &#8220;white trash&#8221; on Amren before and I do so again now in your case of use.  Poor people are created by neglect, and as often, by abuse.  Every race and culture has its losers, and no civilized society is truly civilized if they don&rsquo;t do something to help their least.  I&rsquo;m not even a Christian, but I think that directive is scriptural. It makes sense to anyone but a selfish animal.  From the name, I would guess that they are Tinkers, the Irish &#8220;gypsy&#8221; class of landless wanderers who used to be tolerated in their lifestyles of mobile caravan living, with their colorful horse drawn homes, dancing children who would beg for their living.  But the government had to intervene, largely due to the insistence that they not wander.  I own a copy of a great film on this issue (although unintended) Into the West, which is really a children&rsquo;s film.  No effort is made to educate them, and no police are forward enough to actually do anything to teach where the line is drawn.  So that&rsquo;s what you get.  But calling any white person TRASH is not helpful. </p>

<p>Thank you! As soon as you said Tinkers I remembered. I was havng trouble with the term Travellers which I had never heard before. But now I remember my grandmother and my father and his brothers sometimes talking about the Tinkers. They couldn&rsquo;t have been that bad because I don&rsquo;t recall any really negative comments, just that they were very clannish and never stayed in one place for long. As I recall, they were considered sort of like itinerant tradesmen. I never heard them referred to as anything like White trash. I think they were considered just a quaint part of Irish history and culture. I certainly never heard that they were hated or feared.  </p>
<p>Of course, I heard these things a long time ago before the West went totally mad.     </p>

 Sorry for any offense. Thank you for the education. I just wanted to point out the view that many British have of the Gypsies, white and Romani. Sadly enough, the subject family in this news item re-enforces that bad image.However, I will put aside my wide brush.<br>
    But I would also like to point out that if we are going to visit a web site that many call a racist white supremacy site,with most of us viewers claiming otherwise.We must be able to admit and deplore anti-social behavior of people within our own race as well as others. If we can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t do that, then we really are racist.   </p>

		<p>I think these are Irish (white) &#8216;travellers&rsquo;. Not the Asiatic Roma Gypsies. The &#8216;travellers&rsquo; seem to have emerged after the 1640&rsquo;s &amp; 50&rsquo;s when Ireland was decimated by religous civil war and Cromwell&rsquo;s army (which committed some horrific atrocities). Many Irish were forced off their lands and driven to the west of the island, where the soil is very poor. Some of them never found any place to settle down and began a roving existence, which they have continued to this day. Given all the injustices Britain has inflicted on Ireland perhaps it is only fair that the U.K. taxpayer is on the hook for them.</p>

		<p>Anonymous at 6.30 might be pleased to know that &#8220;Travellers&#8221;are no more welcome in Ireland than they are in wicked old England.<br>
It is also worth noting that not all travellers are of Irish stock,a sizeable minority are actually English and (nominally)protestant.The Romany population also differs from the thoroughbred newcomers arriving in ever-increasing numbers from eastern Europe,having interbred with the natives long enough to produce blond children,rather like certain modern day Oklahomans who claim Indian roots.The one unifying factor that binds Travellers,Gypsies,and Roma is a propensity for lawlessness,that makes them unwelcome anywhere between the Urals and Connemara.  </p>

		<p>I applaud the Travellers for having so many kids.  Now, if we could just get more sissified Whites to have as many kids as many of our people once did, we wouldn&rsquo;t be facing our genocide on this dark planet.</p>
<p>Keep having kids Travellers.  Your kids will dance on the graves of the twits who look like their shoes are too tight and who are dying off.</p>

		<p>A number of comments seem to assume these travelers are White though I see no mention of them being White in the article. In my fanciful world, only muslims (usually Paki muslims) and blacks know how to use the system as these people seem to be doing. SO! for lack of confirmation, they are henceforward BLACK MUSLIMS!</p>

		<p>Skip, they are Irish Travellers.  Go to the original article.  They are White.</p>
<p>Irish Travellers are often blond haired and blue eyed.</p>
<p>Because of their large families, they may be the Adams and Eves of any Whites who survive into the future.</p>
