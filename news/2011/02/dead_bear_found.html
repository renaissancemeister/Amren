<h1>Dead Bear Found in VA Park May Have Been Killed for its Bile</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Gaines, WMAL-AM (Washington, D.C.), February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Humane Society of the United States is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to a conviction in the death of a bear cub that may have been killed for the bile stored in its gallbladder.</p>
<p>A clean up crew working in Prince William Forest Park found the remains of a black bear cub a trash bag in mid-November but police still do not know who killed it. The bear&rsquo;s insides were missing, including the gallbladder that can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market in Asia, a spokeswoman for the Humane Society told 630 WMAL News.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bile of bears is used in some traditional Asian [cultures] for medicinal purposes, so the bear gallbladders are taken and often sold overseas where they&rsquo;re literally worth their weight in gold,&#8221; Elise Traub, deputy manager of the Humane Society&rsquo;s Wildlife Abuse Campaign, told WMAL.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Poaching black bears is a problem across the country because their parts can bring in a good deal of money. As a result, many states have laws against selling their parts, Traub said.</p>
<p>The Wildlife Abuse Campaign runs a nationwide anti-poaching program and offers rewards of $2,500 for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of poachers.</p>

		<p>A black Bear was killed for its&rsquo; gallbladder so a Chinese legal immigrant can increase his reproductive potency so as to ensure a substantial asian geneline in America.Or, to put it another way, the Asian Legal immigrant race-replacement war against the Native Born White Majority requires the destruction of America&rsquo;s Wildlife.</p>
<p>By the way, the snakehead fish problem-a very serious problem and  dangerous fish species(the largest subspecies of the snakehead fish species is a very dangerous fish and it has made its way to America)-started in Virginia&hellip;.a direct consequence of a Chinese legal immigrant releasing a breeding pair into the Potomac River. All of Virgina&rsquo;s rivers-the states whole river system- are now infested with the snakehead fish. The Asian population of the state of Virginia-along with the Muslim population of the state-is exploding.</p>
<p>It is an indisputable fact that Asian legal are a mighty serious threat to America&rsquo;s wildlife.</p>
<p>There are no economic,cultural,demographic reasons for importing Asian immigrants.</p>
<p>When Jared Taylor makes the environmental and ecological case against high fertility post-1965 nonwhites he should do it with the kind of detail that I have presented here&hellip;and don&rsquo;t pull any punches.</p>

		<p>Just recently in New York an Asian reptile/amphibian smuggling ring was broken up before they could ship hundreds of our native red-eared sliders, snapping turtles, salamanders, newts, and frogs to China. These were to be served in Chinese restaurants or used for medicinal purposes. Now that the Chinese have eaten or killed off their own herps with pollution, they send their alien agents over here to steal our animals. </p>

<p>In other news, British farms are experiencing a surge in thefts of lamb, which coincidentally are in high demand for Muslim feasts (Aid Ei Adha).</p>
<p>In accordance with Arab customs, during the month of pilgrimages to Mecca, a live animal must be killed by having its throat slit on the prescribed day.  </p>

		<p>In China, bears are kept in cages with an IV running permanently from the gall bladder, bile being drained. A commodity highly prized.</p>
<p>Medicine the value of has never been determined except by Chinese folk remedies.</p>
<p>When some of these species go extinct, the Chinese are going to have a lot to answer for. But that western sentimentality with animals does apply in the same way with the Orientals, does it?</p>

		<p>One would think that the cubs would be denned up with their sow by then and if so, then there is at least one bear still missing.  In any case, either these &#8216;hunters&rsquo; know the park well enough to find bears in late autumn.  Or they are using traps and letting the luck of the draw bring the animals to them.  Both of which are give away behaviors.</p>
<p>It was also not terribly smart to fail to bury the carcass remains with lye and hunting scent covers so there is still some hope of catching them.</p>
<p>From the killing method and/or surgical removal site instigate countersurveillance on the likely trails into victim population areas and the hope the poachers get greedy.</p>
<p>While doing a forensic credit check for anyone in the appropriate period who paid for a late year campsite, hotel room or trail entry pass on a straightline vector closest to that point and/or with short term stay.</p>
<p>Parks are actually pretty good about this kind of thing, including license plate numbers for temp stickers.  Something to do with forest fires&hellip;</p>
<p>I would certainly hope that Billy Bob and Uncle Buck are less likely suspects than Van Tran and Nguyen Thieu but these days, easy money is awfully tempting.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t say.  I thought all these Asians coming here were desperately needed to replace Native Born White American engineers and IT specialists.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon you guys!  Celebrate diversity!  Give up your pets and endangered species.   Which is more important to the government, endangered animal species, useless pets owned by Whites or White Genocide?   I&rsquo;d say White Genocide trumps all.</p>
<p>Plus, Big Brother <b>demands</b> that you LOVE multi-culturalism and actively seek the  Genocide of your own people.</p>
<p><i>After the 1975 influx of Southeast Asian refugees, pets roaming Golden Gate Park in San Francisco routinely disappeared. In Long Beach, Cambodians were arrested for butchering dogs in their backyard. Animal shelters had an increase of adoption of black puppies  &mdash;  -they are considered better eating.</i></p>
<p><i>the illegal sale of wildlife and &#8216;wildlife parts&rsquo; generates something like $100 million per year   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s going up, as hard economic times have forced the state to cut back on game wardens. Only 230 wardens regulate 159,000 square miles of land, including 1,100 miles of coastline going 200 miles out to sea. The number of game wardens in California is the lowest per capita in the U.S.</i></p>
<p><i>  &mdash;   Late last month, 11 people were arrested and 120 citations were issued in Sonoma and Mendocino counties after an elaborate ring of abalone poachers with headquarters in a hotel room was discovered.</i></p>
<p><i>  &mdash;   In February, two people were arrested in Monterey County after they were caught with 51 black abalone, a federally listed endangered species.</i></p>
<p>Any Questions?  Care to go up against the government-enforced PC Reign of Terror?  Prepared to lose your job, pension and reputation as a price for speaking out against your own race replacement via government-preferred non-White colonists?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

This Chinese poaching incident is reminiscent of how Asians like the Hmong in Minnesota think.<br>
Asians who hunt do not seem to understand the concept of private property.<br>

		<p>Anon # 2 is right, they decimated their animal life in China, now they are doing the same to the US. Here in CA. they are caught every year poaching abalone. I&rsquo;ve even seen them on beaches collecting starfish by the bucket full. They have no concern for the environment and wildlife.</p>

		<p>Reply to Jedderman:</p>
<p>Bear bile farms are extremely cruel.  I do not agree with everything the animal rights people stand for, but in this case they are right to protest against the cruelty of bear bile farms and poaching bears for their gall bladders.</p>
<p>In fact, in the USA and Canada, licensed bear hunters would not be hypocrites to openly protest against poaching bears for their bladders and other poaching by Asians and other people, involved in these crimes against wildlife,  After all, legitimate licensed hunters are the ones who pay for game wardens in the fight against these crimes against wildlife.</p>
<p>In the USA and Canada, licensed bear hunters would certanly not be hypopcrites to protest against the cruel bear bile farms in China!  That is what bear hunters should do.</p>
<p>Licensed bear hunters want what is best for bears to thrive in the wild.  Poachers are in the same mentality that caused the extinction of such species as the Passenger Pigeon, Heath Hen, and Great Auk.</p>
