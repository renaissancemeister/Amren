			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Price, AOL News, February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican lawmakers want to widen Arizona&rsquo;s illegal immigration crackdown with a proposal to require hospitals to check on whether patients are in the country legally, causing outrage among medical professionals who fear becoming de facto immigration agents under the law.</p>
<p>The medical industry ripped the bill Monday as it was scheduled for a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Doctors envisioned scenarios in which immigrants with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis would stay home from the clinic or hospital and put themselves and the public at a grave health risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is making us into a police state that will try to catch people when they are sick,&#8221; said George Pauk, a retired doctor with an organization called Physicians for a National Health Program. &#8220;Do we want to stop sick people from coming in for health care?&#8221;</p>
<p>Arizona is the first Legislature to take up such a measure amid a national push in conservative states to crack down on illegal immigration, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. {snip}</p>
<p>The discussion about the bill comes just days after an illegal immigrant in Texas with a banana-size tumor in her spine said she was ousted from her hospital because of her immigration status. She later found another hospital to get treatment.</p>
<p>Supporters say the hospital bill is necessary tool to fight illegal immigration at a time when hospitals lose tens of millions of dollars treating illegal immigrants in emergency rooms.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The legislation, known as Senate Bill 1405, would require hospitals, when admitting nonemergency cases, to confirm that a person seeking care is a U.S. citizen or in the country legally. In emergency cases where the patient isn&rsquo;t here legally, the hospital would be required to call immigration authorities after the treatment is done. Hospitals in non-emergency situations would also be required to contact federal immigration authorities, but they would have more apparent discretion about whether to treat illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>I hope every hospital in the country adopts this, although I heard a doctor say no law like this will stop them from treating patients who need medical care, no matter who they are. This is getting to the ridiculously insane point. Taxpayers will continue to be drained financially because the illegal population used the emergency room for everything, with no questions asked. This is on my mind today as my husband had the misfortune last evening to trip and landed on his face on the concrete sidewalk. We immediately went to the emergency room, only abour four minutes away. He had great treatment. He required nine stitches in his forehead and had a broken nose, and a CAT scan was taken. While he was waiting to get taken care of, he was asked for his insurance card and a photo ID. Now, I wonder if the Hispanic man waiting with his small child was asked for any identification at all? However, I&rsquo;m sure, he passed the charges off on us and all the other taxpayers waiting. Why must we pay for people who ignore our laws and break and enter our country?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t stop with hospitals and health care. Make utilities check immigration status before connecting services. Same with business licenses, trades licensing, permitting, library cards, school admissions, credit cards, commercial accounts, bank accounts, airline tickets, bus stations, nursing homes, hotels/motels, building permits and vendor permits. Make it very clear in this country&hellip;..illegal aliens will not be given a pass just because they got past the border patrol.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t make doctors into police. Just use the police, or the ICE, or the border patrol. One agent per hospital, checking patients for ID. Really, what could be easier?</p>

		<p>GOOD!!!  I hope the practice spreads to every single border state in the USA.  Remember - illegal aliens cost ALL OF US legal USA citizens $338 BILLION dollars EVERY YEAR   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;d only cost us $46 BILLION dollars per year to deport every last one of &#8216;em.  What&rsquo;s it going to take for our bankrupt states AND country to truly understand those numbers?  War with Mexico?</p>

		<p>Good idea to start billing Mexico for the bill instead of the American tax payer and if Mexico refuses to pay start confiscation of Mexican property in America. No longer will the Mexican National <br>
be able to run across the Mexican border and stick us with the bill.</p>

This is garbage.  Hospitals must report drug overdoses, gun and knife wounds, domestic abuse, and child abuse.  Why don&rsquo;t they comlain about that?  Doesn&rsquo;t that make them de facto police officers?  Doctors get paid big bucks, if they love illegals so much, they should pay their medical bills.  </p>

<p>First: Who are Physicians For A National Health Program?<br>
Second: Yes! We do want to stop sick people (who don&rsquo;t belong here and who violate our law to be here) from coning in for health care! Let them go to their own country for that. <br>
Third: Even if we do treat an illegal after they come here, we can have our government bill there government. Mexico, of example, could pay with oil, gold, silver, wheat, tomatoes, etc. They are worth more than our dollar. </p>
<p>We need to think outside the box a bit and not impoverish ourselves by being the world&rsquo;s patsies. </p>
<p>These Physicians For a National Health Program are probably a bunch of wealthy dudes that don&rsquo;t mind at all if Mr. Average Taxpayer pays the bill!</p>

<p>Actually Doctor..the answer to that is YES. <br>
Why dont you ask the following question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we want to keep going year after year to the white taxpayer<br>
..forcing him to pay against his will?&#8221;</p>
<p>As for your fears of a possible &#8220;police state&#8221;..we already have<br>
one run by the IRS..and when whitey doesnt pay he goes to jail<br>
Why no concern about that coercion and surveillance eh Doctor?</p>

		<p>Even if a bill passes an ACLU lawyer will shop it to a liberal judge who will say No, Arizona can&rsquo;t deny services to anyone and that will be the end of it.Even if that decision was appealed another judge would say the same thing. This country is ruled solely by judges and that&rsquo;s a simple fact. </p>

		<p>I just came form that website and commented on it.  Good news, someone counted up the first few hundred comments and it is about 95% FOR the Bill.  We are waking up a little more each day.  Phase two, ELECT officials that agree with us.  People need to realize that real &#8220;change&#8221;  will not come from either a Republican or a Demoncrat.  They are both too ingrained in corruption to care.</p>

<p>We want to stop them from coming into the country, and if they do, they should do so legally, and with the proper medical screening. Just as all of our ancestors endured in places like Ellis Island -where incidentally tuberculosis was one of many disqualifying causes -and you were required to foreswear any allegiance to any foreigh prince or potentate&hellip;</p>

<p>We are doing that already.  If someone comes in with a gun shot wound, or if spousal or child abuse is suspected, hospitals are required to notify the police.  This is not so different.</p>

		<p>Doctors are &#8220;outraged&#8221; but are they willing to give up their massive salaries to treat illegals? Some how I think not. It is the only profession where the employees demand their employer go bankrupt in order to satisfy their own vanity. </p>
<p>They are mortified at the prospect of immigrants being refused non live saving treatment but not at giving them free treatment and then charging others more for their care to pay for the illegal&rsquo;s flagrant theft.</p>

		<p>You can bet that hospitals ask for a patient&rsquo;s medical insurance, to which I don&rsquo;t hear any great outcry that this will stop people from seeking emergency care.  Getting info regarding someone&rsquo;s legal status should be a lot quicker and easier than insurance data.  Lack of neither would cause an ill person to be tossed into the street.  Are we to stop ER&rsquo;s from reporting gunshot wounds because such a procedure might deter black gangbangers from seeking help?</p>

<p>That ship has already sailed.  According to Federal law, hospitals and ERs must report gunshot wound victims to some law enforcement agency.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take this one step further and require utility companies (electricity, phone, cable, water) to verify US citizenship or authorization to live in the country before services are provided.  The social security number provided on the application could be run through E-verify.  If an illegal tries to get a friend or legal relative to do it on their behalf, that person must show two documents that verify they live at that address like a drivers license, passport, etc.  </p>
