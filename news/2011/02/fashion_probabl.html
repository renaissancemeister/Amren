<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rising model Leomie Anderson will have to work twice as hard as her white peers to succeed. Hannah Pool reports on an industry that is stuck in a time warp</p>
<p>Leomie Anderson is being compared to Naomi Campbell. Photograph: Premier Model Management </p>
<p>At 5ft 10.5in, with feline features and legs like a gazelle, Leomie Anderson makes quite an impression when she enters a room. With her hair tied back and wearing no makeup, the 18-year-old has the kind of beauty that is both knockout and approachable.</p>
<p>Anderson, who was spotted when she was 14 by a scout from Premier Model Management, is one of the stars of The Model Agency, Channel 4&rsquo;s new seven-part series following Premier&rsquo;s bookers, scouts and models, which starts tonight.</p>
<p>In her first season, last September, Anderson walked for Marc by Marc Jacobs, Giles, Topshop Unique, Ungaro and Loewe (for whom she opened the show). She also caught the eye of uber-stylist (and editor of biannual fashion magazine Love) Katie Grand. Inevitably, comparisons are being made with Naomi Campbell, whose career was also launched by Premier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m flattered people compare me to Naomi Campbell, because she&rsquo;s done so much in the modelling industry, but I don&rsquo;t want people to think I&rsquo;m going to be &#8216;the next Naomi&rsquo;. I want to be my own person. I want to be known for my writing, not just modelling,&#8221; says Anderson, who blogs for US magazine Essence.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for more than one successful black model, but it does seem that popular culture can only deal with one at a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a lot harder to start a black girl than a white girl, for a number of reasons,&#8221; says Carole White, Premier&rsquo;s founder. &#8220;There&rsquo;s not so much work for them, and sometimes photographers and makeup artists are scared. They don&rsquo;t know how to light or make them up properly so it takes a lot longer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s a slower process.&#8221;</p>
<p>White first called for greater diversity in the fashion industry in 2008. &#8220;In the last couple of years there&rsquo;s been a movement of trying to get more black girls into the business, but it&rsquo;s an attitude. Right now everyone is scared  &mdash;  they think, if I take that risk, will she sell my products? So they go with the tried-and-tested white girls.</p>
<p>Is the fashion industry racist? &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think the industry is any more racist than anywhere else,&#8221; says White. &#8220;It&rsquo;s driven by what sells and, in general, white blonde girls sell, that&rsquo;s the mindset. In actual fact, black girls do sell but they&rsquo;re not given as many openings. It is safer to go with a white girl, and in a recession people are very conservative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Booker Annie Wilshaw puts it more strongly: &#8220;Yes, I&rsquo;d say the industry is racist. In Milan black girls never work. In Paris it&rsquo;s still the same. It&rsquo;s 2011 and that&rsquo;s quite disgusting, really.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilshaw continues: &#8220;When the client sends you a brief you know straight away they&rsquo;re not talking about a black girl. They say they want &#8216;a girl with long hair, who looks like a fairy&rsquo; or something. When they want a black girl, they will say &#8216;looking for mixed-race girl, tribal-prints location, desert scene&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really bores me when photographers shoot black girls the same way, with a tribal print and some bright eye-shadow going on. Come on, that was Alek Wek in the 1990s, do something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the success of some prominent black models, such as Puerto Rican Joan Smalls (who has just signed for L&rsquo;Oréal), Chanel Iman and Jeneil Williams, Premier still warns its black girls that things will be harder for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I explained to Leomie when we took her on that she won&rsquo;t get the options as easily as the white girls, because it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s so much harder to develop the black girls. She has to work twice as hard to get picked up on,&#8221; says Wilshaw.</p>
<p>Does Anderson think the industry is racist? &#8220;How can you expect fashion not to be slightly racist when the world is still racist? There&rsquo;s racism and prejudice in every aspect of life, so yes, fashion probably is a bit racist,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Does she get disheartened? &#8220;There are a lot of girls, white, black, Chinese, Asian or whatever, who have got a lot stronger walk than me, or a unique look, and if a designer is looking for that particular look, and I haven&rsquo;t got it, maybe it&rsquo;s not because of my colour.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is not a time warp when people find their own women to be more attractive or more gorgeous. Why would they not? Lemmie guess, it does not matter what the consuming public wants&hellip;.make it black anyway? Better wait for a seller&rsquo;s market.<br>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t think of anything more likely to make me want to buy something then to see it on a black male with a scowl on his face for all the injustice the white man has put on him.</p>
<p>I know the first question I ask myself when I am shopping for any item &#8221; I wonder what blacks would do &#8221; it makes it so much easier to decide once they put their mark of approval on it.</p>

		<p>Okay, since the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s nations are NON-White, then why oh why can&rsquo;t Ms. Anderson model in them? Honestly, why not? She has roughly 100 black or majority black nations in which she could begin a career catering to people who look exactly like her. YET, like EVERY SINGLE MINORITY she has decided to work in White nations, live in a White nation, and proceed to complain about that same White nation. NO ONE IS KEEPING YOU HERE MS. ANDERSON! You have a world to choose from. By all means, go to a less &#8220;racist&#8221; and more black nation. We won&rsquo;t have our feelings hurt, I promise.</p>

<p>Really, is the black modeling industry really that racist? Oh, you mean there is no black modeling industry  &mdash;  she wants to push her way into the white modeling industry instead? Silly me.</p>
<p>Of course blacks are incapable of creating their own thriving industries  &mdash;  they must push their way into white institutions instead, while complaining about &#8220;racism&#8221; the whole time.</p>
<p><i> Does Anderson think the industry is racist? &ldquo;How can you expect fashion not to be slightly racist when the world is still racist? There&rsquo;s racism and prejudice in every aspect of life, so yes, fashion probably is a bit racist,&rdquo; she says.</i></p>
<p>Of course there is never any &#8220;racism&#8221; on the part of blacks. That is always the unspoken assumption on the part of articles and people like this. It&rsquo;s just one hate slur after another against whites.</p>

		<p>While she sounds like a nice girl, she is not what I would consider attractive.  </p>
<p>Think about it: the wacko clothes you see all those models wearing all the time, black women are not going to dress like that.  Most white women would never dream of dressing like that either.</p>
<p>The whole fashion industry is an ego trip for haughty &#8216;designers&rsquo; and the bored rich people who go to see the spectacles like it was an animal circus or freak show.</p>
<p>The trouble with inserting more and more black girls is that human nature, which you cannot fight against, forces people to identify with others who look like them.  If you have half the models black, many whites will not identify with them, even if they consider themselves otherwise open minded.</p>
<p>There are plenty of black designers out there from sean jean to fubu.  They use only black models with an occassional white girl.  Why not go after them to have more white (or mexican) girls?</p>
<p>Ah but the double standard is alive and well.</p>

No matter how hard you try, we could not care less about your opinions and our buying habits will not change.<br>

		<p>Hey, sorry. She&rsquo;s not attractive - in fact, she&rsquo;s a bit repulsive. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s very nice but I can&rsquo;t help it that she wasn&rsquo;t born a white, blond female.</p>
<p>Her argument, if you could call it that, makes no sense. The standards for beauty are what they are - you cannot change them to fit some racial guideline.</p>
<p>That being the case she should find another line of work of accept the fact that she&rsquo;ll never be a top-end model.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make $1000 a day doing male modeling shoots. But that&rsquo;s like me complaining that the fashion industry is discriminating against me for being a 46 year old slightly overweight white male who doesn&rsquo;t really exercise a lot and has a graduate degree instead of years of fashion experience. I&rsquo;m not GQ material - and I&rsquo;m not going to indict the style makers for being racist or sexist or ageist or whatever. </p>

		<p>The obsession with blonde females is mainly driven by inhabitants of countries where blondness is either rare or non-existent.This basically means all points south of the Alps,where even the frumpiest northern european women find themselves under constant harrassment.The fashion industry is astute enough to recognise this and markets itself accordingly.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many white women stop buying upscale products that get snapped up by black women  &mdash;  since these products become associated with ghetto chic. I&rsquo;m thinking about Coach and Uggs lately. Several years ago, it was the Burberry plaid motif. <br>
All I know is, when a black niche model/spokesperson is flacking a specific product, I tend to be a little more reluctant to buy it. (Thinking about that Allstate guy now&hellip;)</p>
