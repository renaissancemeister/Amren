			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Slack, Daily Mail (London), Feb. 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Labour&rsquo;s open-door immigration policy led to the largest population explosion since the Saxon invasion more than 1,000 years ago.</p>
<p>An audit of official figures last night revealed that during the party&rsquo;s 13 years in power Britain&rsquo;s foreign-born population increased by three million.</p>
<p>At the same time, nearly a million British citizens left the country.</p>
<p>The report shows that net immigration, the number of immigrants arriving versus those leaving, had reached almost three million by mid-2009.</p>
<p>Campaign group MigrationWatch said figures to be published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday will show that by mid-2010 that total had reached 3.2million.</p>
<p>In recent years, migrants have been arriving at the rate of around &#8216;one every minute&rsquo;, the group&rsquo;s report says.</p>
<p>It comes as a poll found, for the first time, that those in the 16-24 age group were more worried about migrant numbers than those in their 30s.</p>
<p>The 3.2million population increase does not include illegal immigrants  &mdash;  of whom there are around one million in the UK.</p>
<p>MigrationWatch says the &#8216;three million-plus extra people on this island equates to the creation of three cities the size of Birmingham&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The open-door policy was pursued with no public consultation, the study says.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: &#8216;This has been a clear failure of democracy due in large part to the Left&rsquo;s deliberate tactic of stifling reasoned debate with accusations of racism.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the years to come, immigration will be seen as Labour&rsquo;s great betrayal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The MigrationWatch document says: &#8216;Immigration under Labour is certainly the largest ever in numerical terms and the largest in relation to population since the Saxon invasions over a thousand years ago. </p>
<p>&#8216;The only two subsequent immigrations  &mdash;  the Huguenots in the 17th century and the Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries were minor by comparison with recent inflows. </p>
<p>&#8216;Net foreign immigration over the past five years has averaged 24,000 a month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The report also says that of the 3.2million immigrants, 80 per cent came from outside the EU, and that, since 1997, 75 per cent of extra jobs created went to foreign-born workers.</p>
<p>It states that more than a third of new households will be a result of immigration  &mdash;  requiring 330 new homes every working day for 23 years. </p>
<p>And it points out that the percentage of children born to a foreign mother almost doubled under Labour to 25 per cent. </p>
<p>This comes as an extra 500,000 children arrived in our primary schools and a similar number do not have English as their first language.</p>
<p>The report says even New Labour&rsquo;s favourite think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, acknowledged last year &#8216;that immigration under New Labour has changed the face of the country&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew said: &#8216;We would agree, the sheer scale of what has occurred is changing Britain fundamentally and irrevocably and in ways the majority of the population did not ask for, were not consulted about and did not wish to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The MigrationWatch report estimates that 5.5million foreign migrants arrived in 13 years of Labour government, not accounting for those who left.</p>
<p>That is the equivalent of 423,000 a year  &mdash;  or 48 an hour. In recent years, the figure rose to around 470,000 per annum  &mdash;  close to one every minute.</p>
<p>Last night, Immigration Minister Damian Green said: &#8216;Unlimited migration has placed unacceptable pressure on our public services over the years. </p>
<p>&#8216;That is why we are currently carrying out major reform of the system to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands. </p>
<p>&#8216;We have already introduced an annual limit to the number of economic visas from outside the UK alongside new proposals to reform other routes of entry including student, marriage and settlement visas, which have in the past been subject to widespread abuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Critics have insisted Labour adopted a deliberate policy of mass immigration to create a &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; country.</p>
<p>Last night, Labour&rsquo;s immigration spokesman Gerry Sutcliffe said: &#8216;This is an unbalanced, misleading and highly political report. Migration levels increased initially because of the strength of the British economy over many years. </p>
<p>&#8216;The most recent figures show net migration from outside the EU was coming down as a result of the points-based system and over a third of &#8220;long-term migrants&#8221; were in fact students, the vast majority of whom study, pay their fees, and then return home.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The article does not even touch on the main point of all this.  White people are being forced to build the homes, grow the food, and provide everything else for these non-whites&hellip;.to the point that no one has any time to have their own families.  A deliberate ethnic cleansing of whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time that whites refused.</p>

		<p>This started in the 1950&rsquo;s, the objective was a Marxist solution to the problem of indigenous people becoming too strong for the ruling elite. It was basically cultural genocide and I can assure you that it was planned .<br>
In Cambridge, 1975, I was told that &#8220;working class people ( of England )  and the &#8220;North,&#8221; are of no importance and don&rsquo;t exist.&#8221; The man speaking was white, wealthy and very well placed . In the 1950&rsquo;s we were told as children that the future of Britain was not Caucasian. <br>
They got what they wanted, a Britain with no ties to the past and a hatred of western values which astounds me . Britain is to be a mulatto nation of uneducated urban peasants dwelling in iron cages of superstition and fear. The religious state will be Moslem . I wish it were different but the ruling class and the few whites left are Hell bent on turning the island into a sewer.<br>
I see no counter revolution, I see no white army, I see no white hope . The BNP is perhaps the last light which shall be dimmed by assassins. That&rsquo;s not a wish, just a hunch. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a general election here in Ireland on friday.Not one of the parties has spoken about &#8220;the elephant in the room&#8221;,immigration.One in five people on welfare are non irish and yet immigrants are still arriving despite 450,000 out of work.It&rsquo;s costing millions of euro&rsquo;s to &#8220;help&#8221; asylum seekers.The political class are so out of touch with the wishes of the irish people that i can see major trouble ahead in terms of race relations.</p>

		<p>The British people are surely fools to have elected this government many times over.</p>
<p>England as we used to know it is dead.</p>
<p>The only way to bring it back is with civil war.</p>
<p>Highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Glad there is an ocean between us and them.</p>

		<p>The Anglo-Saxon invasion is the defining point of English, as this event gave the former Roman province of Brittania a new people, culture and language that has persisted to this present day.<br>
 The numbers of Anglo-Saxons who ever invaded Brittania was orders of magnitude lower than 3 million, furthermore the process was spread over a period of centuries rather than just 13 years.Therefore it is justified to say that the Labour Party&rsquo;s lunatic &#8216;open-door&rsquo; policy of massive uncontrolled immigration amounts to nothing less than the founding of a new nation composed of a new people.</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, Bank of England Governor, Melvyn King warned Britain that it will face the tighest squeeze in living standards for 90 years ie since the 1920s.<br>
  The justification and rationale for the Labour Party&rsquo;s lunatic &#8216;open door&rsquo; policy of massive, uncontrolled immigration was economic, apparently it was supposed to generally increae living standards.</p>

<p>If the people didn&rsquo;t ask for it then why should it be &#8220;irrevocable&#8221;?</p>
<p><i>The MigrationWatch report estimates that 5.5million foreign migrants arrived in 13 years of Labour government, not accounting for those who left.</i></p>
<p>If they&rsquo;ve all entered in the last 13 years then why not simply repatriate them? Why allow this invasion to stand?</p>

		<p>I think a lot of &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; are closet globalists who believe the nation state is obsolete. Those who are against immigration are soon bribed or cajoled into having the &#8216;right &#8216;opinions. That is why the create such a sense of inevitability - well it&rsquo;s happening or it&rsquo;s happened and there&rsquo;s not much we can do. </p>
<p>Because the left has won the cultural war in the 1960s the most any conservative will say without being marginalized is &#8216;we have to curb&rsquo; not stop or deport. but as things start to unwind - and it looks like they are very quickly - that might change. </p>
