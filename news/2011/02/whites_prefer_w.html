<p>Data from more than 1 million profiles of singles looking for love online confirms that whites overwhelmingly prefer to date members of their own race. The same is not true for blacks, especially men, who are far more likely to cross the race barrier to meet a mate.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed the racial preferences and online activity of people from the United States who subscribed between 2009 and 2010 to a major Internet dating service. In their profiles, the online daters stated if they had a racial preference.</p>
<p>Researchers were then able to compare the online daters&rsquo; stated preferences with whom they actually contacted for a date, and they found profound differences between blacks and whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who said they were indifferent to the race of a partner were most likely to be young, male and black,&#8221; says Gerald Mendelsohn, a psychologist, professor of graduate studies, and lead author of the study, which will soon be submitted for publication.</p>
<p>Overall, he said, &#8220;Whites more than blacks, women more than men and old more than young participants stated a preference for a partner of the same race,&#8221;</p>
<p>The reluctance of whites to contact blacks was true even for those who claimed they were indifferent to race. More than 80 percent of the whites contacted whites and fewer than 5 percent of them contacted blacks, a disparity that held for young as well as for older participants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The main findings of this study parallel the census data on marriage in that blacks are more likely than whites to be in interracial marriages, and that couples in which the husband is black and the wife is white are more common than those in which the husband is white and the wife is black, according to Mendelsohn.</p>
<p>&#8220;One theory is that blacks are acting like other minority populations in the history of this country,&#8221; Mendelsohn says. &#8220;They are interested in moving up in the power structure, and one way you do that is through intermarriage with the dominant group.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the study, more than 80 percent of the online dating contacts initiated by whites were to other whites, with only 3 percent going to blacks. {snip}<br>

		<p>They always do these studies to make whites look like racists for not wanting to date blacks, but they never mention that Asians are less likely to mate with blacks.  Asians always get a free pass.</p>

		<p>White men might not be interested in dating black women (and it&rsquo;s no wonder) but they have no qualms whatsoever about putting a check box next to Alaskan/Native American/Asian/Latino/Hispanic/Arab/Brown Mish Mash/Mixed-Race. I have used these types of websites in the past and whenever I come across a profile where a white man indicates no preference for race (except for black women), then I immediately skip him over. Especially if he adds in a bit about how he worked in Africa for one year on a humanitarian aid mission giving out candy to AIDS orphans. It&rsquo;s hard to tell sometimes who is truly that naive and who is just too afraid to publicly admit that they might be &#8220;racist&#8221; (in other words, only interested in dating other whites). </p>
<p>As a white female, I received dozens of messages from black men, most of which were the most ghetto types imaginable. &#8220;HEY GIRL HOW U DOIN&rsquo;&#8221; &hellip; &#8220;don&rsquo;t ignore me like that, get back at ya boi!&#8221; in spite of the fact that I expressed an interest in white men exclusively. I&rsquo;m sure that this happens to all white women on these websites, no matter where they might be on the attractiveness scale.</p>

		<p>So black males are open to dating anything that moves, gee what a surprise.</p>
<p>On a related note, is it just me or does it seem that interacial dating agency banner ads, often seem to be placed on right wing blogs?<br>
Some sort of ironic joke perhaps.</p>

<p>So, white women still prefer white men by a large margin, despite all the interracial couples one sees on tv and in the movies..I&rsquo;m so proud of them for resisting the multicult onslaught. It&rsquo;s enough to fill a white man&rsquo;s heart.</p>

		<p>I watched the video that accompanies this story and post and no one said anything about not wanting to date a person of antoher race. I did hear two people, a Black woman and a bi-racial Hispanic man state that they had preferences, but they still were open to dating outside of their race. </p>
<p>In fact, the vast majority of those interviewed were clear that they were open to interracial dating. What is even more interesting is that they were VERY convincing in their comments. They were not being politically correct.</p>

		<p>Gee, could the reason come down to an instinct that one&rsquo;s offspring look somewhat like themselves and not something that is almost unrecognizable? I believe this is part of the reason that more Whites do not choose to marry outside their race. <br>
Of course in Southern California (LA County) you do tend to see White men with Asian or Hispanic women but rarely with Black women generally.</p>

<p>I work with the military in Afghan/Iraq/Kuwait and pretty much anywhere they are and if you wanna see some damned insulting conduct towards White women, watch black men in the military hit on White females in the military (black women are not safe either) but it is the White women that catch the brunt of the rude, sexual and insulting innuendo when they decline any contact with blacks. White female soldiers often are seen walking with blacks because the blacks tag along unwelcomed and the females are loathe to appear racist. The situation is worse when the armored patrols leave for the day or days, since most of the line combat troops are White and that leaves most of the black males on camp to accost the White females with no help or support from officers or senior NCO who also fear being cited as RACISSSSSSSS thereby ending their careers. We also have monthly seminars pointing out that &#8220;Sexual assault and RAPE&#8221; is &#8220;&#8221;&#8220;UNLAWFUL&#8221;&#8220;&#8221; a rather mild description of a capital felony I should think. But the troops only have to qualify with their weapons once a year! RAPE is also very common on the camps here in Afghanistan with the usual victim/assailant we know and love so much, though the race of the assailant is NEVER announced, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for it to get around. ALSO! ALL posters put up by the military (all branches) depict black males and white females, almost no exceptions. </p>

		<p>Thank goodness that things like natural ethno-centrism and genetic similarity theory are assuredly at work here!</p>
<p>However to be totally realistic one must admit that another factor is involved here and it is that White Women are by far the most physically attractive Race of Women.  </p>
<p>Speaking as a White Man (Half-Norwegian, half-German) I wonder why the heck other White Men would even consider other racial types as mates!  <br>

		<p>I was glad to see this article and that most white women prefer  white men. As a Caucasian woman I would only date Caucasian men. I love my Western heritage, culture, and language and I would expect my boyfriend or hubby to love them to. Also, many times black and Hispanic men have brought up racial issues like the historical racial grievances that they have. This is a turn off for me.</p>
<p>Many times blacks and hispanics have asked me out on dates. I always turned them down but I never told them it was because I don&rsquo;t believe in inter-racial dating. So far, not one has called me a racist. Amazing!</p>

		<p>How many people here can relate to what I witnessed one day at work. While sitting at a table in the break room with other employees, I observed a black guy constantly trying to &#8220;hit&#8221; on a white women,over and over he would keep saying what a good time he would show her. When she did her best to ignore him and told him he was &#8220;full of it&#8221;, the black guy did what so many do to white girls, played the race card by saying,&#8221;What&rsquo;s the matter, don&rsquo;t you go out with black guys?&#8221; And of course this white girl did not want to appear to be a bigot, so at that moment she had a case of &#8220;white guilt&#8221; and said &#8220;yes&#8221;. But I could tell by her reaction that she probably didn&rsquo;t go out with black guys. The point is why do blacks feel they have to play the race card when it comes to dating. Did it ever occur to that guy that perhaps she didn&rsquo;t want to date him because he was acting like an idiot, or he was unattractive? And even if she didn&rsquo;t want to go out with him because he was black, that is her choice, and has nothing to do with being a bigot. It always has to be about race with blacks if they don&rsquo;t get their way.  </p>

<p>I agree with Roger. I watched the video as well and the students being interviewed were genuine in their remarks. The fact is that there are people who for whatever reason) do not have an issue with interracial dating. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.  If I was in that situation I would go militant feminist (even though I&rsquo;m not) on his black behind and tell him it&rsquo;s none of his business whom I date and then I would report him for sexual harrassment. No woman needs to be pushed into a situation like that in the workplace.  At the very least you can tell him your already dating someone. </p>

They simply cannot accept a &#8220;no&#8221; answer.  No matter what reason you give (ex: &#8220;I&rsquo;m married&#8221;), the comeback is always the same &#8220;nah, man, you jus racisss &hellip; &#8220;.</p>

		<p>#6 - That is basically true - statistics show there are approximately two white male/Asian female marriages for every black male/white female marriage.</p>
<p>But step back and think about this. How often do you see white male/Asian female pairs in the media? Rarely, if ever. The same is true for Asian male/white female, black/Hispanic, and even white male/black female couples. The one pairing that is consistently and continuously shoved down our throats by the controlled media is the black male/white female. Whether on sitcoms, dramas, movies, or advertisements, this is the kind of couple that the media are desperate to manipulate us into accepting&hellip;no, more than accepting - worshipping.</p>
<p>This is for a reason. No other type of couple will destroy white culture and white integrity faster than the black male/white female pair - and of course, the destruction of whites as a people is the controlled media&rsquo;s ultimate goal. We&rsquo;ve all seen it - the empty-eyed white woman with her mulatto offspring, abandoned by her black &#8220;baby daddy&#8221;, scorned by thinking people, and whining to herself, &#8220;But MTV made this look so much cooler!&#8221;<br>
Her children will grow up fatherless, undisciplined, and violent, with huge racial chips on their shoulders. In the spirit of Obama, they will despise their white mother and all their other white ancestors, and embrace militant &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; blackness.</p>
<p>No other interracial pairing will do this much damage, this fast. True, the offspring of a white male/black female couple will be considered forever black, wasting the white genes that could have been put to better use and increasing the black population. But at least they&rsquo;ll have a father around and have some order and discipline in their lives.</p>
<p>Any of my White sisters who are on the fence and considering dating a black man&hellip;take my advice and DON&rsquo;T. It is NOT how MTV makes it look. There is NOTHING cool, glamorous, or progressive about it. Find a good White man who will love and cherish you. Don&rsquo;t throw your genes away.</p>

		<p>Eric, you may think the story sounds suspect, but I believe the original poster 100%. The poisonous atmosphere of political correctness that hangs over both corporate and government jobs has led to a strict racial/sexual hierarchy where someone who is the victim of harassment from a person above them in the hierarchy has virtually no chance of getting justice. White men are at the very bottom, but white women occupy the second lowest position. Above them are Asians, above them, Hispanics, and at the top, blacks, gays, and Muslims compete for supremacy. </p>
<p>The race grievance industry is far more powerful than the feminist grievance industry, and any company knows they have far more to fear from Jesse Jackson and his ilk than from NOW and other feminist groups. That is why corporations and governments are content to allow black men to sexually harass white women. At any rate, the &#8220;feminist&#8221; groups are all race traitors anyway, and never defend white women from males &#8220;of color.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Edna and Roger, you are wrong and Fred is correct. Polls consistently show that around 75%-80% of white people SAY they have no problem with interracial dating. And yet how many white women actually marry black men? Less than 2%. The total percentage of whites who engage in interracial marriage of any kind is under 5%.</p>

		<p>So many people say one thing and do another.  So many feel they must pretend to support race mixing, and in reality they don&rsquo;t.  I go to a black barbershop.  I am the only white client I have ever seen there.  I take my children to a black pediatrician.  I can count the number of white clients I&rsquo;ve seen there on one hand.  I live in an overwhelmingly white, liberal neighborhood, but the public schools are predominantly nonwhite.  All of these do-gooders talk about integration, but their children are all shoved into private schools.  </p>

		<p><i>And he did not get written up (or given the current climate toward sexual harrassment)fired? This story sounds suspect.</i></p>
<p>Maybe,maybe not. Certainly if a <i>white</i> man behaved in the manner related,he&rsquo;d be out on the sidewalk with a huge black mark in his copybook so fast it would beggar belief. (Us pale types are easy targets. All we&rsquo;re good for is to work-when the EEOC bean counters show up with sanctions and lawsuits at the ready,we count for nothing at all.)</p>
<p>But juggling the various protected classes can be a complicated game. Blacks are definitely protected,so the question becomes one of what trumps what in the diversity game. If the company in question had plenty of women working there,but were low on blacks,then it could very well be that the brother is safe. (The debates on differing degrees of protection can,and do,approach the complexity of theological discussions. Which,since our new god is Diversity,is only fitting.)</p>
<p>And it could also be an episode of an employer wanting to keep the known devil,rather than risking a lawsuit from a (justifiably) terminated black employee,then having to jump through all kinds of hoops to hire another black employee to fill the gap. And then finding out that the brother who got hired in place of the brother that got fired is just as bad,or even worse than the one that was already there. It happens,believe me.</p>

Edna and Roger, you are wrong and Fred is correct. Polls consistently show that around 75%-80% of white people SAY they have no problem with interracial dating. And yet how many white women actually marry black men? Less than 2%. The total percentage of whites who engage in interracial marriage of any kind is under 5%.</p>
<p>Actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p><br>
Not always true. Just because a person has no personal objection to something does not mean they are willing to partake in it. Example, I sincerely would have no problem with the U.S. government legalizing marijuana, yet I still would not use it.</p>

		<p>I think that 80 percent figure is way too low.  On the internet a person can assume the identity of anyone they want.  There&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who for whatever reason want us to believe that miscegenation is more common than it really is.  I imagine there are also black women who&rsquo;ll pretend to be White to try to land a black date.  </p>

&#8220;White men might not be interested in dating black women (and it&rsquo;s no wonder) but they have no qualms whatsoever about putting a check box next to Alaskan/Native American/Asian/Latino/Hispanic/Arab/Brown Mish Mash/Mixed-Race. I have used these types of websites in the past and whenever I come across a profile where a white man indicates no preference for race (except for black women), then I immediately skip him over.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Don&rsquo;t be so quick to dismiss the guys who don&rsquo;t check off a racial preference. Probably lots of guys do this thinking that if they don&rsquo;t, given how large a percentage of white women are liberal brainwashed that they will write the man off as being a &#8220;racist&#8221; right off the bat and not date him. </p>
<p>That being said, I will say that when I was using internet dating a few years ago, in looking through women&rsquo;s listings, and looking at men&rsquo;s listings to examine the competition and get some ideas, that women seem to be more bold about listing racial preferences.<br>

<p>I think your analogy is apples and oranges.

On Friday, you comparison shop on the car lots and find a Saab that really catches your eye, and buy it.  On Saturday, you&rsquo;re driving your new Saab around and find that, gosh darn it, everyone is driving Saabs all of a sudden.  Really, they&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s just that you never noticed the relatively few Saabs on Wednesday but you do pay extra attention to them on Saturday simply because you own one now.</p>

		<p> Only in a study done in Berkeley could the researchers be so naive, or wilfully blind to the real world, to wonder why few Whites want to &#8220;hook up&#8221; with blacks.</p>
<p> Elephants don&rsquo;t mate with giraffes; nor bears with tigers; nor dogs with cats. Yes, donkeys and horses will breed with each other if given the chance, producing mules. But donkeys and horses are first cousins, anyway.</p>
<p> In the main, then, the animal kingdom sensibly keeps its mating within species. In my estimation, Whites and blacks, although obviously both human beings, are not the same &#8220;species.&#8221; Whether you view Whites as a more evolved people descended from those who came &#8220;out of Africa&#8221; many millennia ago; or as a separate species entirely who originated somewhere other than Africa, the differences in physiognomy, IQ, athletic ability, etc., are too glaring for the saying among liberals that we&rsquo;re &#8220;all the same under the skin&#8221; to have any validity. No, we&rsquo;re not &#8220;all the same,&#8221; above or below the skin.</p>
<p> As to black men marrying White women to be &#8220;upwardly mobile&#8221; as the study claims, that statement would make a fencepost laugh. Black men marry   &mdash;   or rather, try to bed whenever possible   &mdash;   White women because of the blacks&rsquo; insatiable sexual appetite, because White women tend to be far more attractive than black ones, and, most significantly, because they see it as &#8220;gittin&rsquo; back at Whitey&#8221; by defiling &#8220;his&#8221; women.</p>

How many people here can relate to what I witnessed one day at work. While sitting at a table in the break room with other employees, I observed a black guy constantly trying to &ldquo;hit&rdquo; on a white women,over and over he would keep saying what a good time he would show her. When she did her best to ignore him and told him he was &ldquo;full of it&rdquo;, the black guy did what so many do to white girls, played the race card by saying,&rdquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, don&rsquo;t you go out with black guys?&rdquo; And of course this white girl did not want to appear to be a bigot, so at that moment she had a case of &ldquo;white guilt&rdquo; and said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. But I could tell by her reaction that she probably didn&rsquo;t go out with black guys. The point is why do blacks feel they have to play the race card when it comes to dating. Did it ever occur to that guy that perhaps she didn&rsquo;t want to date him because he was acting like an idiot, or he was unattractive? And even if she didn&rsquo;t want to go out with him because he was black, that is her choice, and has nothing to do with being a bigot. It always has to be about race with blacks if they don&rsquo;t get their way. </p>
<p><br>
The fact is that Black men do not have a monopoly on being aggressive toward women. I have woked at a number of places and lest me assure you that White men and Hispanic men are just as aggressive in pursuing women. </p>

		<p>I am a White Male of mostly Celtic extraction, Scot, Scot-Irish, Irish. My grandma was 1/2 Choctaw (my family is from Oklahoma, common occurrence there), so I am not all the way lily-white. White is the race I claim, that is what I am the most of, and I am proud of it.</p>
<p>I am married to a Mexican girl and she is paler than me, I suspect her family was more Spanish than Mestizo. Our kids look very European. </p>
<p>I was married previously to an American woman of Swedish descent, and it was a thoroughly unhappy pairing, to the point I&rsquo;d sworn off the institution of marriage completely for over 13 years. </p>
<p>I was a career Marine for 22 years, huge numbers of my friends married foreign girls, Asians and Hispanics mostly, but others as well. As far as White American men marrying outside their culture, I may have a simple expanation for it. </p>
<p>American women (thanks to 40 plus years of feminism) have made themselves singularly unattractive, marriage-wise. Marry a girl in this country today and there is a better than 50/50 chance you will will be divorced, 75% of the time, she will initiate it. When it happens, you will be raped. </p>
<p>You will lose most of what you own, be left with bills for the things she takes with her. Oh yeah, and did I mention the child support you will pay for the kids you will rarely see and that she will make every effort to ensure you have no hand in raising? And the legal system (I won&rsquo;t dignify it by calling it a justice system) will help her do it to you. She will do this and not turn a hair over it when she does. Now was someone going to tell me why I should have married another American woman?</p>
<p>My position is that White American men are not so much turning their backs on their own race as they are the women in their own country. I don&rsquo;t have any statistics to quote here, but from my personal observations I&rsquo;d say that the guys that are marrying foreign girls have marriages that are hanging together far better than those that married inside their own culture. </p>
<p>I think a lot more guys would be marrying blond haired, blue eyed American girls named Tiffany or Jennifer if they hadn&rsquo;t already had it shoved up their tailpipes by one of the Tiffany&rsquo;s or Jennifers, or seen it happen to their friends, brothers, dads, uncles, etc. </p>
<p>Just a thought, boys and girls</p>

<p>When I was using Internet dating, I used those features to better my choices. For example, I would provide a nice essay about myself and then add a section of things I do not like and are definite turnoffs&hellip;</p>
<p>- interracial dating<br>
- loud, outspoken, liberal women<br>
- cats</p>
<p>On my profile &#8220;check marks&#8221;, I selected &#8220;White only&#8221; and &#8220;Conservative only&#8221;. I received many replies and met some very nice women. Im fact, I married one and we have been happily married for five years. It pays to be honest.</p>
<p>If any man is hoping &#8220;not to scare away liberal women who may fear he is a racist,&#8221; he&rsquo;s only hurting himself. It&rsquo;s better to scare them away and find a good, conservative woman.</p>

		<p>One of the interests of this website is hoping for a secure future for white people.  For that to happen, don&rsquo;t white people need to marry each other and produce white babies?

<p>You want to blame white women, but how are you yourself innocent?  You don&rsquo;t seem to be doing any good for our race either.</p>
<p>It appears to me that most white men prefer white women (based on all sorts of evidence).  I really don&rsquo;t understand where these phantom theories come from about &#8220;most white men are sick of white women&#8221;.  Give me a break. You are with an Asian woman because you are part of the problem.  Stop blaming &#8220;most white women out there&#8221; when most white men don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with white women.</p>
<p>We need to be coming together as a race.  I don&rsquo;t understand why lots of men in this movement think it is productive to bash white women all the time.</p>

I don&rsquo;t see much of such inter-racial socialization.  Here, a<br>
very large contingent of PRC students is remarkable for its<br>
&#8220;us/them&#8221; dichotomy and  for the Chinese &#8220;in group&#8221; affinities as distinct from elective interaction with the (yet ) majority American population.  It is somewhat suggestive of a possible covert Chinese belief that what is good about America can be taken to China and advanced and refined and propagated much better there than here.  There is widespread perception by them that the US is a rapidly declining and inferior power.  There is remarkably little N. Asian and American Black elective socialization.  </p>

<p>Have you ever thought about the fact that many White women (like women in general) want to be treated as human beings, not as sex objects or unappreciated stepford wives who are merely accesories for their husbands. In all due respect to you sir,how many of have seen so many, in fact far too many American men (especially White, well bred, well wed and well fed men) leave his wife who had stood by him often through thick and thin, cheat on her and more than often leaves her for a trophy wife when she does not look &#8220;quite the same&#8221; as she did during those first early years of marriage?  </p>
<p>I know firsthand, it happened to my mother. I know of several friends where they have experienced such shallow behavior from men. So did I</p>
<p>No I will not tell you why you should marry an American White woman, but I will suggest that you think about some of the reasons that women are understandably leaving their husbands in considerably growing numbers. </p>

In fact, several of my buddies and me as well go GAGA whenever they see any of these women on tv. For the record, most of us are married and to White women.

		<p>Courtney, all through the 70s and 80s the film industry was promoting White male/black female relationships but it didn&rsquo;t work so they changed tactics and concentrated on White females/black men.  Films/TV shows/commercials and anonymous internet postings such as are found here are all part of the course.  They&rsquo;re meant to create this illusion that White women are man hating feminists who&rsquo;ll bed black men if given the chance.  It&rsquo;s meant to shape other White men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s opinions about each other and hopefully get some black men to see these things and start believing them themselves.    </p>

If a person refuses to date, marry or have sex with a person outside their race, they are not going to do so. It&rsquo;s that simple. Case closed.</p>
<p>Why some of you get your panties in such a bunch over this topic is beyond me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would you like to give you a standing ovation.  Maybe AmRen is just upset that the mainstream media constantly, and endlessly recommends white women dating black men?</p>

<p>The average African American has 13 percent European ancestry. You&rsquo;ll note that all the really beautiful African Americans exhibit more European racial characteristics than African racial characteristics.</p>
<p>If you want to see what a 100% pure African look like, you will have to come to Africa, but let me tell you, they are not pretty and yes they look a lot like M Obama.</p>

<p>No I will not tell you why you should marry an American White woman, but I will suggest that you think about some of the reasons that women are understandably leaving their husbands in considerably growing numbers. &#8220;</p>
<p>I am 59, and I didn&rsquo;t get married until I was 47, even though I came close a number of times.  Reason; American women (on the West Coast at least) were always so self-serving, obviously interested in the financial side of the equation, climbing up as their goal.  They have been made increasingly demanding of men via feminism, and use it to justify anything they want at the time.  They tend use sex as a manipulation weapon.  Then they are outraged when the man seeks companionship elsewhere.  Feminism has played a large part in the ruin of the institution of marriage and the number of fatherless children.  </p>
<p>I was able to observe this up close since I was always getting hit on in my professional setting, but ignored in public in general.  I got to know an unusually high number of personal lives as a health care practitioner.  Also, one of my longer term girlfriends made her living creating custom bridal gowns, so I got to learn about the attitudes of brides to be.  That, along with just my own time on the scene taught me that most women get married as a trial, if they don&rsquo;t get the life they wanted, after about seven years, they get a divorce and of course, half the material possessions, alimony, child support, etc.  And if there was animosity in the split, they have many powers to make their ex miserable, and they do it actively.  The other thing I have noticed all along is how difficult it is to find a female over 18 who hasn&rsquo;t already had a baby or two. American women bring little to the table in general and expect everything.  When I worked in Eastern Europe, I found the women there far more desirable as marriage partners, although some Western feminism was creeping in.  However, in general, Slavic women are extremely loyal and hard working.</p>
<p>Most young American women today seem to be loudmouthed, pushy, over &#8220;assertive&#8221; Tania Harding types.  They think having multiple sex partners before marriage is a given, they are so obnoxious that they are often only trumped by a black male, who will likely disrespect them and physically abuse them enough to calm them down, and of course by then they are ruined. So when they do &#8220;GO BACK,&#8221; they are damaged goods and have the attitude of a damaged psyche.  Unless you want to be run by a woman, and deal with all this social fallout, American women are best avoided.  </p>

But NOT to bring them home as friends. That under no circumstances would a Black daughter-in-law or Black son-in-law would ever be welcome in our family. In short, mary a Black and your White family will no longer want you, have anything to do with you. End of story.</p>

		<p>Perhaps a key aspect of whatever Majority American and<br>

have a sense of themselves as being a natural functional<br>

tend to transact with men in a way evolved over time in Nature  &mdash;  <br>

<p>While I do think Feminism has caused a lot of problems in society, I do agree with your stance.  Asian fetishers who supposedly espouse pro-white agenda while marrying an Asian Female are hypocrites to the highest degree.  It is equivalent to a PETA member who screams animal rights but enjoys eating steak.  They are very much a part of the problem.</p>
<p>Side note:  I used to live in San Jose where there seems to be quite a bit of half Asian youths at the local schools (in addition to the flood of orientals and Indians). It seems like a number of the half Asians (at least at where my grandson goes to school) tend to date other half Asians or even full Asians. So not only are your gene pools being &#8216;diluted&rsquo;, it also runs the chance of having the white breeded out of it.  </p>

		<p>a previous poster shared his/her experience about a black guy pressuring a white woman to date him. the black guy used the race card because it was the expedient thing to do and in the west the personal preference is no longer sacred. </p>
<p>how many times we men heard that we are wrong to choose woman based on her outer beauty? in fact quite many great thinkers of our time have ventured so far that men ought to completely overlook physical aspect and instead focus only on what is on the inside. well, the black guy too apparently thinks that it&rsquo;s what on his inside that should only matter and thinks whether he is short/fat/bald/unattractive/old/broke/ should be non-issues for the white woman. and even if the black guy is violent he is only violent on the outside while on the inside he is as docile as a lamb and as sensitive as any metrosexual man, just ask him or his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I often see young White boys with pretty young East Asian girls from China or Japan. This is quite an common union perhaps partially because the girls are often less deculturated. I do however then wonder about the partnering prospects of the surplus White girls. It is possibly another reason that so many well educated White women end up partnerless and childless?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well to bring it more into perspective, of whites and asians are most closely related than other racial groups. HINT: CaucASIANS. Our people migrated through caucus region of Asia into Europe. A group, from the original group moving upward, decided to go east.<br>
Asians and whites tend to be more likely to date because they are more similar biologically than say Africans. That might bring another perspective to it.</p>
<p>Feminism does play a factor, but another factor is generally stratification of a mindset that see race as irrelevant. A different &#8220;consciousness&#8221; if you will. This consciousness, while having plasticity, isn&rsquo;t breakable however (as even most anti racist will admit that it is impossible to eliminate race).</p>
<p>Another factor (this is the leading one in my opinion) has to do with sexual selection fundamentally. I&rsquo;m a Social Darwinist. White women are higher on the hierarchy. More men compete for them and they have the advantage to be more choosy, play games, etc. There was an article about how black women were trying to be white. I believe sex and mating is the ultimate driving factor. </p>
<p>Feminism argues in its generality that men and women are the same biologically and we are only constructed differently (sounds familiar to race anyone). Jared Taylor touches on this slightly in his NPI TV talk about &#8220;dangerous myths.&#8221; It [feminism] also argues that the reason to why women were treated different when ultimately men and women are the same (and thus should be treated the same) is because men have oppressed women. While some truths are embedded in these arguments, it lost due to much ignorance for a particular agenda (like race).</p>
<p>I, myself, am having trouble meeting white women in good ol&rsquo; Southern Cali. Many are very superficial, materialistic, narcissistic, masculine, arrogant, etc. It isn&rsquo;t all women. I can&rsquo;t blame feminism for everything. Life isn&rsquo;t black and white.</p>
<p>Thanks for the insight William.</p>

<p>I already replied but what you said was very interesting and true. This is where pride is beneficial. </p>
<p>It can give you confidence, as there is nothing wrong with dating within a group. in this case a race. Some will be more conservative and only date those who are of Nordic or Italian descent. Others will be more liberal and date race and surrounding people who are similar.</p>
<p>When you play a game to try to please or hook someone in it doesn&rsquo;t work. When checking the check box &#8220;whites only,&#8221; did you out of curiosity get any &#8220;You evil racist!&#8221; comments?</p>

<p>Wow!  We are truly living in end times when our own men write these things about us, seemingly despise us so much.</p>
<p>Our enemies, those who wish to see Whites wiped off the face of the earth, must be jumping for joy:  Their plan for White genocide is playing itself out exactly as planned without a shot being fired.  We are following the script laid out for us, that of severely reducing if not eliminating White numbers world wide.  We are down to (what?) 10% of the world wide population and falling?  50% of the American population and falling?  </p>
<p>Our mortal enemies&rsquo; plan is working, better than they&rsquo;d ever dreamed.</p>
<p>How to get Whites to hate themselves and each other, incite internecine warfare, for the purpose of reducing White numbers?</p>
<p>Start young and use the educational system, media and government to wage this War on Whites.</p>
<p>Start at an early age:  Fill school textbooks with nothing but &#8220;Whites are Evil&#8221; propaganda across the curriculum.  Instill guilt for non-White failure and pound it in.</p>
<p>Fill the airwaves and media 24/7 with portraits of White males as weak, wimpy, brainless idiots, those to be laughed at and mocked, in need of saving by brave, strong, virile blacks or browns.  Geez, who&rsquo;d want to be married to one of those losers?  </p>
<p>Money and power are the strongest aphrodisiacs so give blacks the best paying jobs regardless of their qualifications.  Make sure White males are locked out of prestigious colleges and universities, are barred from entry level positions are passed over for promotions, engineering and technology jobs go to H-1B holders from India.  </p>
<p>Cut off White males&rsquo; source of prestige and income forcing any female that marries them into the workplace, making sure White males aren&rsquo;t able to support a family.  Use the tax code as well to keep families separated by work obligations.</p>
<p>Send White women a strong message that their place is in the workplace competing with men, not raising the next generation of White children.  Tell them children are to be aborted, marriage will enslave them, they will live a live of servitude chained to a stove.  Any White female deigning to have children are to immediately hand them over to state-run day care.</p>
<p>Make divorce easy, as in no-fault, abortion available without question, day care a right.</p>
<p>Courtney, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s working well, this plan to eliminate us, to make sure our DNA lines end through childlessness and miscegenation. </p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<p><i>White Women are by far the most physically attractive Race of Women.</i></p>
<p><i>Speaking as a White Man (Half-Norwegian, half-German) I wonder why the heck other White Men would even consider other racial types as mates.</i></p>
<p>I love you guys!  You lead me to believe there is hope for us Whites yet.</p>
<p>I look all around in California and see nothing but a sea of brown and black faces, those who stare at me in hostility because I am Whites.</p>
<p>If you want to know what the United States will look like in 50 years, come to California.  </p>
<p>This is what the War on Whites has produced.</p>

<p>The person didn&rsquo;t say all white women. I believe he is saying that Californian women tend to behave in this way.</p>
<p>Question how do you italicize? There is no button to do it. </p>

<p>&#8220;Probably without realizing it, you are saying that middle aged Black women are more attractive thatn middle aged White women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing of the sort was implied. When Halley Berry turns 65 she will still be considered the most beautiful woman in Hollywood and Naomi Campbell&rsquo;s face will grace the covers of many magazines for years to come, long past when other models are all washed up at 25.  You already know why.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Money and power are the strongest aphrodisiacs so give blacks the best paying jobs regardless of their qualifications. Make sure White males are locked out of prestigious colleges and universities, are barred from entry level positions are passed over for promotions, engineering and technology jobs go to H-1B holders from India.</p>
<p>Cut off White males&rsquo; source of prestige and income forcing any female that marries them into the workplace, making sure White males aren&rsquo;t able to support a family. Use the tax code as well to keep families separated by work obligations.&#8221;</p>
<p>As always one of the best posts on the board is by Bon.</p>
<p>Just one thought to add on the purpose of the H1-B craze. I would venture that as part of the plan for White extermination these Indians and Chinamen arriving under H1-B are also here to provide alternative mates for White women.  After all there are only so many blacks to go around.  By being handed prestigious jobs and titles formerly held by White men these coolies are granted as well the illusion of being successful, intelligent and creative  &mdash;  the qualities actually owned by the White male. Basically,  the H1-B Indians and Chinamen are awarded the chance to play dress-up in the White man&rsquo;s persona as it is stripped away from Whitey.  These 3rd-Worlders ill-begotten money and power are supposed to attract White women to them now instead of those White men who have been reduced to poverty as a direct result of the job-theft caused by this H1-B presence.<br>

		<p>Good posts. One may be tagged as a conspiracy theorist or paranoid, but with the way situations are transpiring in the West, one wonders.</p>
<p>Miss Whitey: Very true. As a woman a white female has to be careful nowadays. And the unfortunate reality is that few whites are going to side with a white woman when she&rsquo;s harassed by minorities. Many of those morons will even side with the minorities in such scenarios.</p>

		<p>This thread has evolved into wondering what whites CAN DO, in the face of an obvious genocidal campaign against us.</p>
<p>One very easy thing to do is to NOT DONATE OR WILL MONEY TO CHURCHES, UNIVERSITIES, or CHARITIES (all of which seem to have become instruments of our enemies).  Instead, try willing it to a struggling white family with kids.  Establish a College Fund for your family as a whole.  We are dying out as a race, because whites cannot afford kids (because our wealth is siphoned-off by government confiscation AND by narcissistic donations to churches, colleges, and charities).</p>
<p>A half-million Dollars will raise and educate a child.  How many rich, narcissistic old men (and silly old ladies) have willed away more than that to idiotic causes?  And think of a certain Narcissist in Seattle, who became rich using white brainpower, but who has given away enough money to some African piddle, to raise tens of thousands of white children (A single billion is a thousand million.  For every billion he gave to &#8216;Africa&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s two thousand white children who could have been, but won&rsquo;t be, born).</p>
<p>Those not blessed with such resources can still do their part, by openly labeling the selfish, traitorous, narcissistic donation and willing of wealth to those outside our besieged race, as being precisely what it is.  The wealthy Narcissist frequently has a Hero Complex.  He will be less likely to give money to &#8216;Africa&rsquo;, or &#8216;Literacy&rsquo;, or &#8216;The Gamecocks&rsquo;, if such actions, in the eyes of his peers, relatives, and sycophants, make him not a &#8216;Hero&rsquo;, but instead, a Traitor.</p>

			80  &mdash;  Advice for Young Ladies from Sadder but Wiser wrote at  4:15 PM on <a href="#c722551">February 23</a>:
		</legend>
		<p>I wish that my parents had given me ANY sensible advice on dating and choosing a spouse before I got to college.  My choice was disastrous (although perfectly white.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my Advice for Young Ladies:</p>
<p>1) Keep your school life/career SEPARATE from your personal life.  When you are in college, don&rsquo;t date guys who live in the same dorm or eat in the same cafeteria complex.  When you break up, it will be a cleaner break.  You cannot be taken seriously at work if you are sleeping with a co-worker.  It won&rsquo;t damage HIS career, but it WILL damage yours.</p>
<p>2) Once you make an exception to Rule #1, you will find it VERY awkward to turn down a date from ANYBODY at work, and this will lead to serious problems.</p>
<p>3) Once you start dating blacks, a lot of whites will cross you off their list of potential dates/mates because they will see you as someone who has slept around a lot, because you are obviously not selective in your dating habits.  Harsh, and possibly untrue and unfair, but that is reality.</p>
<p>4)  Once you have a child out of wedlock, you are no longer a girl that a guy can take Home to Mother with pride, no matter how pretty and educated you are.  Raise this to the nth power if your child is multi-racial. </p>
<p>5)  Guys who ask you out in front of a lot of other people are either insensitive/foolish (see Rule#6) or they are doing it deliberately in order to create an awkward situation so that you will be intimidated into agreeing to go out with them.   </p>
<p>6)  Keep private facts private.  If someone asks you in a room full of people what you usually do on Saturdays, ANY answer at all from you tells too many people too much about your schedule and habits.  Laugh it off by saying, &#8220;That&rsquo;s classified.&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>7) The first time someone asks you for something, it is a request, and you can answer &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221;  If they won&rsquo;t take no for an answer, it is no longer a request, it is BULLYING.  This is true whether the person wants to go out with you, or borrow your car.  </p>
<p>8) If someone asks you out, and he seems like a possibility, agree to go out for coffee with him on Saturday morning.  If you like him, and have a lot in common with him, you can agree to go on a real date with him.  If you do NOT want to have further contact with him, tell him politely but plainly and firmly that you do NOT have much in common, and a relationship between the two of you would NOT work out.  INSIST on picking up the check, and you are now FREE of him.  You do NOT owe him ANYTHING.  (Note:  This technique will not work with blacks or Muslims.  Never agree to have anything to do with either category.)</p>
<p>9)  Meet his parents and let him meet yours EARLY in the relationship.  If you don&rsquo;t like his parents, or if his parents think that he &#8220;could do better&#8221; or if he is rude or inconsiderate to any member of your family, DUMP HIM.  </p>
<p>10)  Read multiple books on sociopathy and toxic relationships BEFORE you start dating.  Most rotten people can fake normalcy for a few months at most.  Move slowly, and you can avoid getting in too deep with a charming horror of a man.  Remember that a sociopath has to work fast in order to con you before you see his mask slip.  He will talk too much too soon about marriage, &#8220;being soul mates,&#8221; etc.  </p>
<p>11) Insist on pre-marriage counseling BEFORE agreeing to an engagement.  Both of you will have to fill out all sorts of forms regarding finances, prior marriages and children, etc.  If anything on the forms does NOT match up with what he has told you previously, or led you to believe, do NOT let him blow it off as a misunderstanding.  Run a background check on him to see what else he has lied about, or better yet, just DUMP HIM.</p>

<p>The black guy hitting on the white girl, couldn&rsquo;t help but play the race card because he was in all probably insecure with himself as a man and his race, in comparison to whites, so to compensate, had to use guilt and play the race card to try to get his way. I just hope for that girls sake that she never agrees to go out with a black, regardless of what any black might say to her.  </p>

This isn&rsquo;t entirely true what you wrote, because many white Americans can be very forgiving. I have a neighbor, who is a single woman, who has a daughter who married a black. This neighbor told me, her daughter asked her if it was ok to marry this black man she was invovled with. The neighbor woman said yes, and then she told me, her family got down on her for giving her daughter this advice, allowing her daughter to marry a black, but now, the neighbor&rsquo;s family, the daughter of the girl who married the black, is finally coming around to accept this.<br>

		<p>I agree that the above story regarding black males asking a woman out and then playing the race card when she says no is likely true.  I suggest they do it precisely because it is an uncomfortable interaction - I think it amuses them.  </p>
<p>I am married and often have my daughter with me when running errands and such.  We live in Chicago and the black men, even the nicely dressed, educated men do not seem to have a problem with asking out or hitting on a married woman (with a child) - a complete stranger in public places!  </p>
<p>I wear a wedding and engagement ring and my daughter is clearly my child, she looks a lot like me (same hair/eye color) and I think you can tell from our interaction that I am not her nanny.  I&rsquo;m not a woman with model looks and I don&rsquo;t dress provocatively.  I have been approached while shopping in a grocery store, in Barnes &amp; Noble, and hit on by a shoe store employee when I was buying shoes for my child.</p>
<p>I always emphasize that I am MARRIED and this child is MY CHILD.  The shoe store employee was chatty and I did not smile or encourage small talk.  An added misery when one of these awkward interactions begins is that everyone around us gets quiet and listens in.  I already feel upset and uncomfortable and my daughter picks up on my anxiety, then on top of it all I have become the freak show entertainment for other patrons.</p>
<p>My coping skill is to just abandon what I am doing and walk away as soon as the &#8220;chatting up&#8221; black guy starts in.       </p>

<p>Frankly, I never considered Angela Bassett or Thandie Newton to be attractive. The first seemed too dark (there&rsquo;s a point on the color scale where darkness in and of itself is just associated with too much bad luggage) and Thandie frankly just looks a bit strange, kind of bug eyed, and with sickly skin. It seems to be a growing trend in Hollywood to put in some less attractive women into movies and try to sell them as attractive (Cameron Diaz looks a bit strange faced too, though does have a good body). Maybe its a feminist poison getting into the system there. God help us if the feminist infection rate ever goes terminal like in Britain- they have largely ditched the scantily clad hot chick for naked men in their movies, it seems.</p>
<p>If Hollywood is trying to shoot itself in the foot with Liberalism, turning off its viewers in the same path as the NYT and other American MSM outlets, then continuing along the ugly woman to naked man trajectory will probably do it even more so than NYT liberalism has, as disproportionately more people who watch movies are young men. And one more great American industry will fall by the wayside. Though a silver lining would be all of the rich liberal nut actors and directors who would have to deal with reality.</p>

		<p>ACTIVISM. Do this. Create a fake account on dating site and declare &#8216;I only reply to W.A.S.Ps&rsquo; or something similar. It is our responsibilty to break the ice for whites so they no longer feel pressure to cross breed.</p>

<p>Lady, <br>
You got to fight back against this sort of harrassment. Contact the manager of the shoe store, or his supervisor and complain, and follow up on this. Or get in touch with the owner, I know it&rsquo;s a hassle, but this behavior isn&rsquo;t acceptable. The more white women that stand up to blacks sexually harrassing them, the more blacks will get the idea, that it just isn&rsquo;t worthwhile to pursue this.  <br>
Stay out of areas where there&rsquo;s alot of blacks, or if you are approached by one, learn some assertive verbal kills, e.g., say, I understand, but I&rsquo;m not interested, say this over and over, and if they keep persisting, maybe you should just tell them to  F &#8216;off. </p>
