			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Linthicum and Andrew Blankstein, Los Angeles Times, February 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 74 reputed members of the Armenian Power organized crime gang were charged Wednesday in a fraud scheme that cost Southern California victims at least $20 million, law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>Authorities said members of Armenian Power, or AP, face criminal charges with potential sentences ranging from a few years to life in prison.</p>
<p>A total of 99 members have been charged in two federal indictments and by the Los Angeles County district attorney with crimes including racketeering, extortion, kidnapping, drug trafficking and identity theft.</p>
<p>Some of the defendants are accused of secretly installing sophisticated skimming devices that allowed them to steal customer account information at a dozen 99-Cent Only stores across the region, according to a 212-page federal indictment unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>Armenian Power members allegedly caused more than $2 million in losses when they used the skimmed information to create counterfeit debit and credit cards, the indictment alleges.</p>
<p>In addition, authorities allege Armenian Power worked in conjunction with African American street gangs to gather information that allowed them to take over bank accounts, often of older victims, that led to financial losses of $10 million.</p>
<p>Andre Birotte Jr., U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said members of the gang used violence to maintain their fraudulent activities. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Armenian Power is a small but virulent gang that took root among Armenian immigrants who arrived in Los Angeles in the 1980s and early 1990s, authorities said. The gang has about 200 members.</p>

		<p>Here is yet another example of why multiculturalism and diversity do not work.</p>
<p>People generally don&rsquo;t steal from their own families. In early America, people grew up in small towns and felt a kinship to their neighbors   &mdash;   same races, same religions (Christianity), same culture and heroes. Kinship and homogeneity reduce crime and violence in society.</p>
<p>Diverse racial and religious groups not only lack this &#8220;altruism&#8221; toward each other, they actually feel it is OK to take advantage of the &#8220;other.&#8221;  They often feel that the &#8220;other group&#8221; deserves what they get.  Hence, diversity increases crime and violence, as different groups attempt to exploit one another.</p>
<p>Another factor in early America was that most people were Christian, and hence followed the Golden Rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Currently our government is flooding the USA with people who do not subscribe to such ideas.  These people have diverse religions that consider Christians as enemies who should be exploited.  </p>
<p>The Armenians are doing exactly what we would expect them to do.  It is our government officials who are to blame for these crimes, because it is they who brought these criminal people here.</p>

		<p>What is the racial classification of ethnic Armenians? I have seen some who look very white, and I have seen others who look much less so. Are they like the Turks, who really don&rsquo;t have a clear racial classification (some are blue-eyed and blonde-haired, while others are dark-skinned, dark-haired, and have dark eyes)? I have not met many Armenians myself, as they seem to have settled mostly on the west coast.</p>

		<p>Armenians generally look white, but are a little bit more ethnic.  Like Italians or Greeks or Spaniards.  They tend to have a reputation for strong business skills and money laundering.  </p>
<p>People from the former Soviet Republics and Caucas region run a lot of financial schemes in Los Angeles County.  </p>

		<p>They are Caucasian. They are bordering the middle east so therefore there has been an admixture of blood. They&rsquo;re borderline, but I&rsquo;d consider them white, especially after a couple generations of absorbing american culture.</p>

		<p>Armenians (you can always tell if somebody is Armenian because their last name always ends in &#8220;ian&#8221;) - live primarily in Glendale and La Crescenta, with some in Burbank and La Canada.  This is north central LA County, a foothill area for the most part.  Armenians usually have money, their kids are well-educated, they own many businesses, and the younger generations often become professionals (doctors, dentists, etc).  Armenians are usually a handsome people, with dark hair, beautiful dark eyes, and light olive skin.  That said, they are very clannish, some of the male teenagers have gangs and terrorize whites, and you really don&rsquo;t want to live in an Armenian neighborhood.  They aren&rsquo;t as just flat out bad as blacks, as blacks are for the most part nowhere near as well-off as most Armenians, but they will not be kind to you if you are non-Armenian and happen to live in a neighborhood they&rsquo;ve infiltrated.  I was surprised to learn that their mafia had joined forces with blacks; Armenians usually look down on blacks and won&rsquo;t associate with them.  But, I guess when there&rsquo;s money to be made, Armenians will sink as low as anybody to get it.  </p>

		<p>Anonymous, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not Jewish, but you&rsquo;re still &#8220;right on the money!&#8221; Ha! Ha!</p>
<p>You may remember that social service groups like the Kiwanis, the Jaycees, the Lions, etc., reached their peak with the Greatest Generation back in the 1950s when America was 90% white.<br>
That was when America was still a NATION. Those groups have all but disappeared as America has become a multi-ethnic empire.</p>
<p>Now America is a bastardized multi-ethnic empire like the old USSR. America chose that route in 1965. I can&rsquo;t wait until the US splits into racially distinct nations like Thomas Chittum predicts in CIVIL WAR II</p>

		<p>On the East Coast, I lived in an Armenian neighborhood in a rust belt city for four years. The Armenians there were Christian and industrious. Most often they were small business owners: take-out food, coin-laundries, pizza, income property, etc. I liked most of them, and  I never had a problem with any. They reminded me of Italians, even they way they spoke.  We all had a common enemy, as they had to defend themselves against violent black and hispanic criminals who also inhabited the city. We also had the common enemy of Islam. As you know, the Turks tried to kill most Armenian Turks during WWI. It was commonly known as the Armenian holocaust. It&rsquo;s actually against the law to talk or write about this holocaust in Turkey. The Turks brush it off, claiming that the Armenians wanted to secede and had to be controlled. It was really hatred of Christianity, and it was a genocide. The last Turkish author who tried publishing a book about the Armenian genocide was brutally murdered.  So much for the civilized Turkish bid to enter the European Union. (That is another horrifying story)</p>
<p>I also have lived in Los Angeles. I didn&rsquo;t live in &#8220;Armenia Town&#8221; but I heard bad things about it. Some Armenians here in the West have embraced gang culture. I want to believe that most Armenians are decent folks, as they were in the East. It seems that the youth are emulating the criminality that they see in rap videos and in other parts of the city. I see some white youth doing the same here in Orange County. I don&rsquo;t believe that Armenians are inherently evil like a large number of blacks and hispancs, but they are becoming a product of their environment. This is an evil place. Excuse the hippie expression, but California has bad energy. Nothing ever good will happen here&hellip;only death and decay.</p>

		<p>Armenians are from central asia and primarily turkic with some slav mixed in. They are not white but they are caucasian under the american racial classification system. They and other people from the caucasus are universally hated in Russia. </p>
<p>Very few americans understand the differences between whites and caucasians. When the census says that by 20xx, whites will be 50% of the population, they actually mean &#8220;caucasians will be 50% of the population&#8221;. The census uses the term white and caucasian interchangeably which is outright desinformation. American whites are already at about 50% of the population. The rest of the &#8220;white&#8221; population consists of non white caucasians like these armenians. If you go by the census categorization, the worldwide &#8220;white&#8221; population is booming becuase there is a population explosion in north africa and the middle east&hellip; </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re doing the same thing in New Jersey. I was a fan of Gov. Chrsitie until he appointed a Muslim to the Superior Court.  He also appears to be in favor of amnesty to illegals.<br>
And of course there is the war on teachers that he&rsquo;s waging; blaming them for the failures of schools in Camden, Atlantic City, Newark and a host of other districts where Blacks predominate.<br>
 As a retired teacher I&rsquo;, saddened  to hear that instead of reforming tenure to make it easier to dismiss incompetent teachers,  they want to eliminate tenure completely and to base teachers careers on &#8220;student achievement&#8221;.  That seems to be sweeping the country right now. Pennsylvania is heading in that direction as well; all because no one wants to admit what the REAL problem is and HAS BEEN articularly in the urban schools. Camden, Newark, NYC, LA, Miami, Milwaukee, Philadelphia ad infinitum et ad nauseum are all experiencing the same problems but it&rsquo;s politically incorrect to blame the &#8220;students&#8221;. How can any teacher cause &#8220;students&#8221; to achieve when they consistently cut school and when they ARE there they spend much of the time wandering the halls, hooking up with their friends and searching out copulation opportunities and when they&rsquo;re IN class they disrupt and all because teachers fear them on the physical level and also fear being labeled racist. We attribute their often bizzare behavior to &#8220;cultural differences&#8221; and no attempt is made toward behavior modification.<br>
 <br>
I compared my bathroom sign in sheet with another teacher&rsquo;s who for the last two years had bathroom duty that came either the period before mine and the period after. There were lots of duplications of the same &#8220;students&#8221;. One could infer that that these people played this game all through the day.<br>
In my 44 years in education I never met a teacher who went into class with an Asian lesson plan, a Black lesson plan, an Hispanic lesson plan and a White lesson plan. Every kid at my school has an equal opportunity to be educated and there are some groups mainly Black and some Wannabe Hispanics who consistently reject it and have been for the last 50 years since LBJ&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Society&#8221; began.<br>
So now, rather than admit that a half century of set asides, social programs, Head Start,  and tens of thousands of dollars per student sent down a rat hole has been a failure, we&rsquo;ll now attack the teachers. They&rsquo;re an easy target because they&rsquo;ve been so hamstrung by PC that they&rsquo;re won&rsquo;t risk defending themselves because that would entail their identifying the problem. That would be an instant career killer.  <br>
A  so called education expert in Philly complained about young teachers going into &#8220;Inner City&#8221; schools and then &#8221; move on&#8221; after a couple of years. DUUUHHHH!!! Better to WALK out than to be carried.<br>
At South Philadelphia High School Asian students were being randomly attacked and beaten, some severely enough to warrant hospitalization,  by groups of &#8220;youths&#8221;. Reporters made sure to mention that the victims were all Asian but avoided mentioning the ethnicity of the attackers. No need to, really. &#8220;Youths&#8221; has become a code word for Black thugs.<br>
Emile Zola said &#8221; If you hide the truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts forth it will blow up everything in its path&#8221;. I&rsquo;m still waiting for that day but in the meantime let&rsquo;s drive teachers out of education. Imagine having your career based on &#8221; achievement&#8221; when you&rsquo;re dealing with a group, the majority of which hasn&rsquo;t a scintilla of a desire to &#8220;achieve&#8221; anything other than mayhem.<br>

		<p>Yet another bad example of the benefits of diversity. The more diversity in a country, the higher the crime rate. Crime and diversity are to each other like cold and ice. You simply can&rsquo;t have the one without the other.</p>
<p>What is needed is to tell our liberals throughout our country where to get off. We&rsquo;re tired of multi-culti. Tired of the crime and social problems that will always be an inseparable part of diversity. As to why liberals worship at the altar of diversity&hellip; something I personally can&rsquo;t figure out. Any person with even half a brain can understand that the only thing diversity offers Americans is endless crime. Endless social problems. Endless parasitism since our &#8220;diverse&#8221; feel it only reasonable and proper to be supported by White Americans in perpetuity.</p>

<p>In addition, authorities allege Armenian Power worked in conjunction with African American street gangs to gather information that allowed them to take over bank accounts, often of older victims, that led to financial losses of $10 million.</p>
<p><br>
This surprises me. In my experience, Armenian-Americans generally look down on those darker than themselves, but they&rsquo;ve been collaborating with black street gangs? </p>
<p>Because the Armenian light-brown complexion is similar to latinos, in California they are often mistaken for Mexicans   &mdash;   which the Armenians do NOT like (and I can&rsquo;t blame them). So if Armenians regard brown mestizos as inferiors, imagine how much worse they must regard African blacks. </p>
<p>But when the stakes are that high, I guess professional criminals will (at least temporarily) work with whichever ethnics will get the job done for them. $20 million is an awful lot of purchases at the 99-Cents stores. Over 20 million of them, in fact. </p>

		<p>Armenians are from the Caucasus mountain area, formerly part of the USSR. They&rsquo;re generally dark haired, dark eyed, and have a reputation for being quite sharp. You can see from the crimes described they have some computer skills and are some steps up from lowly smash and grab type crimes. They are Christian, however, and are one of the very first ethnic groups in the world to have come forward to adopt Christianity as a group. They&rsquo;ve lived in a bad neighborhood throughout their existence and have had to adapt in order to survive. You can view them as swarthy eastern cousins to the Europeans. Of course, the ones who migrate out may not be a true representative sample.  </p>

<p>The Armenians are primarily of Orthodox Christian background; a much smaller number are Catholic.  They are very anti-Turk as they were nearly slaughthered as a group in the early 20th century by Muslims from Turkey.</p>
<p>An Armenian would take great offense at being accused of being Muslim.</p>

		<p>@Skip #4 - You&rsquo;re half right, Armenians have the typical Middle-Eastern ethnocentric morality.  They feel absolutely NO moral obligation to those outside of their own group, and they&rsquo;re famous for &#8220;strong business skills&#8221; (i.e. fraud, tax evasion, welfare fraud, etc.) as Johnny C. put it.  This is also a consequence of living under communism for decades.  However, they are by definition Apostolic Christian, not Muslim.</p>
<p>Like most non-European caucasians, they identify with us when it is in their advantage to do so, or as asians (in this case) when there is an AA benefit.  In the free-for-all that is California, a very large percentage of their population is here illegally.</p>

		<p>To #4:  Armenians are NOT Muslim.  Their native religion is the Armenian Apostolic Church, an Orthodox-like religion that was purportedly founded by a direct disciple of Jesus and became the first &#8220;national&#8221; Christian church.  Few US Christians know about it since it is a theological &#8220;outlier&#8221;, being Monophysite (rejects the belief that Christ is simultaneously all god and all man).  In recent years, some Armenians in the US have broken away to form Armenian Catholic and Armenian Protestant parishes. </p>
<p>The Armenians in the Boston suburbs tend to be closely associated with the local Greeks.  They place a high value on acquiring and preserving wealth. </p>

<p>Not only is your post wrong, it is the direct opposite of the truth. Armenia was the first Christian kingdom in the world. Armenians are devoutly Christian and generally despise muslims, particularly Turks and Azerbaijanis. In the 1880&rsquo;s and during WW1, the Turks engaged in a brutal genocide against the Armenians, partly because of their being Christians. Estimates of the death toll are between 1.5 - 2 million people. Muslim  Azerbaijan and Armenia have almost come to war on several occasions. You would be hard pressed to find a people more historically hostile (and with good reason) to Islam then Armenians. </p>

<p>Not only is your post wrong, it is the direct opposite of the truth. Armenia was the first Christian kingdom in the world. Armenians are devoutly Christian and generally despise muslims, particularly Turks and Azerbaijanis. In the 1880&rsquo;s and during WW1, the Turks engaged in a brutal genocide against the Armenians, partly because of their being Christians. Estimates of the death toll are between 1.5 - 2 million people. Muslim Azerbaijan and Armenia have almost come to war on several occasions. You would be hard pressed to find a people more historically hostile (and with good reason) to Islam then Armenians.&#8221; </p>
<p>I read somewhere, someone making a very good point about how Imperial Empires create problems like this when they form and then inevitably break-up.  The historical oppression of the Ottoman Turks on the surrounding non-Turkish populations was instrumental in creating black market alternative societies for the sake of survival.  The taxing and suppression was so intense and long (500 years) that the problems of mafias and other similar gang business is normal and expected in these regions.  Imperial Russia did the same to its minorities, and even its own Russian people.  So when they come to the West and in this case America, they see all the opportunities for exploitation and they do it.  </p>
<p>The few Armenian people I have know were really decent people, but by insisting on bringing in so many people from so many troubled areas of the world into the U.S., we are actively destroying our society on every level.  There is no sign that common sense will regain its place in our domestic policies any time soon, so the wise are well advised to prepare for some really difficult times ahead.</p>

<p>Baron! Sorry! but I personally know hundreds of Armenians and they are without doubt MUSLIMS! they are also hostile and beligerent muslims. They have thrown down their prayer rugs in my shop to pray and refused to move..I ultimately chose not to deal with them and they were beligerent about that too. They also are hard to collect from with more excuses than blacks have. When dealing with Armenians, demand cash, but better not to deal with them, they are also inclined to violence. SO! your experiences are different than mine clearly.</p>

&gt;The most handsome people of Anatolia are Turkish HANDS DOWN. Turkish, particularly the men, are beautiful.</p>
<p>From  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turki" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turki</a></p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, &#8220;Turki&#8221; was used as an adjective by Bedouins in the Najd region of Saudi Arabia meaning &#8220;handsome&#8221;, as the Turkic peoples (fom Central Asia), commonly designated Turks in medieval Persian and Arabic sources, were considered handsome. Thus, they named their children &#8220;Turki&#8221; because they look handsome as children.Turki is a popular name now in the Gulf States, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.&#8221;</p>
<p>And also keep in mind there was a good deal of white people living in Central Asia during the Turkic movements to the west. There are a semi-nomadic group in Turkey called the Turkmen who are blonde, blue eyed and distinct from the Turkmen in Turkmenistan. The founder of the Turkish republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, claimed descent from these nomadic Turkmen who were settled in the Balkans during Ottoman times.</p>

		<p>The problems with determining the racial classification of Armenians seems to be part of a larger problem in determining the race of middle eastern peoples. On the US census they get classified as &#8220;Caucasian&#8221;, and some of them certainly are very white (some Turks, especially in the upper classes, have blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin). On the other hand, some are very clearly not white, such as many people from the Arabian peninsula (Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia, for example, looks like a mulatto). While I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of the idea of bringing in any of them as immigrants (even the white middle easterners tend to bring along the clannish mindset that prevails in the region), the most dangerous thing that we can do is bring in a lot of &#8220;white&#8221; middle easterners who are probably not even white and act in a manner totally at odds with the norms of white European society.</p>

<p>You &#8220;personally&#8221; know &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of Armenians? To say nothing of anyone from a non-Armenian background? You must be a very popular person? And they are &#8220;all muslims&#8221;? I don&rsquo;t believe this at all.</p>
