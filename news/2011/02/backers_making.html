<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-politics/20110221/US.Boxing.Pardon/">Backers Making Another Run at Pardon for Boxer</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frederic J. Frommer, Comcast News, February 21. 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lawmakers are going another round in their fight to get a posthumous presidential pardon for the world&rsquo;s first black heavyweight champion, who was imprisoned nearly a century ago because of his romantic ties with a white woman.</p>
<p>New York Rep. Peter King and Arizona Sen. John McCain, both Republicans, plan to reintroduce a congressional resolution urging a pardon for boxer Jack Johnson. Another supporter, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said he will talk to President Barack Obama&rsquo;s new chief of staff, William Daley, and Attorney General Eric Holder about the cause.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion a century before Obama was elected the nation&rsquo;s first black president. The boxer&rsquo;s flamboyant lifestyle and his relationships with white women inflamed white sensibilities. Racial resentment boiled over after he defeated a white boxer in the &#8220;Fight of the Century&#8221; 100 years ago last summer. Three years later, Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for immoral purposes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>King said he was surprised that Obama didn&rsquo;t act during the last session of Congress, when the House and Senate passed the resolution. But the congressman said he&rsquo;s still optimistic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about righting a wrong,&#8221; she [one of Johnson&rsquo;s great-great nieces, Constance Hines] said</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In their efforts to prosecute Johnson, authorities first targeted Johnson&rsquo;s relationship with Lucille Cameron, who later became his wife, but she refused to cooperate. They then found another white witness, Belle Schreiber, to testify against him. Johnson fled the country after his conviction, but agreed years later to return and serve a 10-month jail sentence.</p>
<p>In his 2005 documentary, &#8220;Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,&#8221; filmmaker Burns explored the case against Johnson and the sentencing judge&rsquo;s admitted desire to &#8220;send a message&#8221; to black men about relationships with white women. Burns helped to form the Committee to Pardon Jack Johnson, which filed a petition with the Justice Department in 2004. {snip}</p>
<p>The effort went nowhere during the Bush administration. Burns, McCain and King revived it in 2009, confident that Obama would act on the request  &mdash;  especially after the resolution passed both houses of Congress for the first time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Johnson won the world championship on Dec. 26, 1908. Police in Australia stopped Johnson&rsquo;s fight against the severely battered Canadian world champion, Tommy Burns, in the 14th-round, leading to a search for a &#8220;Great White Hope&#8221; who could beat Johnson.</p>
<p>Two years later, Jim Jeffries, the American world titleholder Johnson had tried to fight for years, came out of retirement to challenge Johnson for the championship in a 45-round &#8220;Fight of the Century.&#8221; They squared off on a scorching Independence Day in Reno, Nev., at a stadium that had been quickly constructed for the match. Johnson won, but deadly race riots ensued, as angry whites took out their frustrations on blacks, especially those who had celebrated Johnson&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Clinton awarded the PC Congressional Medals of Honor  towards the end of his second term for those supposedly overlooked because of racial discrimination; now that fraud, McCain, wants to reverse a conviction for PC reasons. Perverted honor. Perverted justice. Not so surprising from a guy with his perverted behavior while a prisoner in North Vietnam.</p>

		<p>Oh, so now we have to go about the task of &#8220;righting every wrong&#8221; ever done against a black person?  Well, we demand equal time.  What about all the wrongs done against white Southerners during the Reconstruction time?   Please.  There&rsquo;s enough wrongs to go around.  Let &#8216;em go and get on with this business of living, here and now.</p>

<p>Whites looking for champion against black success: Proof of white insecurity in the face of black superiority. Whites should acknowledge that blacks are better at everything and therefore submit to any and all black desires.</p>
<p>Blacks looking for champion against white success: Proof that each white is engaged in a conspiracy to destroy blacks. Despite being totally inferior to blacks, sneaky whites manage to find a way to break the rules.</p>
<p>Heads, blacks are gods. Tails, whites are devils. Understand?</p>

		<p>This kind of thing can keep the racial grievance hustlers busy in perpetuity. There will always, always, and I mean ALWAYS be some historical incident that one can dredge up that requires much hand-wringing, presidential pardoning, and yes, monetary &#8220;restitution.&#8221; Any black who was ever enslaved, imprisoned or &#8220;unfairly treated&#8221; by mean ol&rsquo; whitey can be hauled out 100 years or more after the fact for a presidential &#8220;pardon.&#8221; Heck, if we really work at it, we might have time for little else. </p>
<p>For true poetic justice, the descendants of the white women who were mistreated by this boxer should come out and demand restitution. That would really make things interesting, but most whites are too browbeaten to do anything like this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The boxer&rsquo;s flamboyant lifestyle and his relationships with white women inflamed white sensibilities&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, it was Johnson&rsquo;s behavior in the ring that made him a reviled figure.  He made that other media darling, Mohammed Ali, look like a sportsman.  When Johnson had an opponent overmatched he would grin and taunt him - check out Johnson&rsquo;s wins against Jeffries, Burns and Flynn on YouTube.  </p>
<p>Jack Johnson was not smiling the last 10 rounds against Jess Willard, when he realized he couldn&rsquo;t knock out Willard and was running out of gas.  When Willard clocked him in the 26th round, Johnson later claimed he had thrown the fight.  Even ultra-liberal Ken Burns admitted this was bunk in his syrupy documentary on Johnson.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see something is this precedent is being looked at more thorough than immigration, national security, deficit, etc.  This IS the most important thing in the world now.  Anyways, this is more Liberal propaganda.  If you look at best heavyweight boxers ranking throughout its existence Jack Johnson gets moved up a couple notches every decade.  Fact.  Another fact is that he was not arrested for sleeping with white women.  He was arrested for transporting prostitutes across state lines, USING prostitutes, and physically beating them.  All of these laws are still on the books and enforced to this day, unless it is black male on white female crimes&hellip;.Come to think of it, he should be pardoned, I mean its not like he raped and murdered a blonde news reporter in Arkansas&hellip;..</p>

		<p>There are riots and revolutions all over the middle east and north Africa, we have two wars that have dragged on for a decade, 16% unemployment and a federal deficit of over $14 TRILLION. But at least our GOP congressman have their priorities straight. Nothing is more important than getting Johnson a pardon.</p>

		<p>If it was illegal back then, it was illegal.  It was illegal for Al Capone to produce and sell alcohol back in the 1920s, yet nobody is going to pardon him. I&rsquo;m sick and tired of having to constantly pander to blacks and change the rules for them.  </p>
