			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Williams, MSNBC, February 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three years ago, Lamar Grace left Detroit for the suburb of Southfield. He got a good deal  &mdash;  a 3,000-square-foot colonial that once was worth $220,000. In foreclosure, he paid $109,000. </p>
<p>The neighbors were not pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t want to live next door to ghetto folks,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>That his neighbors are black, like Grace, is immaterial. Many in the black middle class moved out of Detroit and settled in the northern suburbs years ago; now, due to foreclosures, it is easy to buy or rent houses on the cheap here. The result has been a new, poorer wave of arrivals from the city, and growing tensions between established residents and the newcomers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a way in which they look down on people moving in from Detroit into houses they bought for much lower prices,&#8221; says Grace, a 39-year-old telephone company analyst. &#8220;I understand you want to keep out the riffraff, but it&rsquo;s not my fault you paid $250,000 and I paid a buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The neighbors say there&rsquo;s more to it than that. People like John Clanton, a retired auto worker, say the new arrivals have brought behavior more common in the inner city  &mdash;  increased trash, adults and children on the streets at all times of the night, a disregard for others&rsquo; property.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the summer months, I sat in the garage and at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning you see them walking up and the down the streets on their cell phones talking,&#8221; Clanton says. &#8220;They pull up (in cars) in the middle of the street, and they&rsquo;ll hold a conversation. You can&rsquo;t get in your driveway. You blow the horn and they look back at you and keep on talking. That&rsquo;s all Detroit.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve got people of color who don&rsquo;t want people of color to move into the city,&#8221; says Southfield Police Chief Joseph Thomas, who is himself black. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a black-white thing. This is a black-black thing. My six-figure blacks are very concerned about multiple-family, economically depressed people moving into rental homes and apartments, bringing in their bad behaviors.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;They still think it&rsquo;s OK to play basketball at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning; it&rsquo;s OK to play football in the streets when there&rsquo;s a car coming; it&rsquo;s OK to walk down the streets three abreast. That&rsquo;s unacceptable in this city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas has seen the desperation of the new arrivals. His officers, handling complaints, have found two or more families living in a single house, pooling their money for rent. They have &#8220;no food in the refrigerator and no furniture,&#8221; Thomas says. &#8220;They can&rsquo;t afford the food. They can&rsquo;t afford the furniture.&#8221; But they were eager to flee the gunfire of their old neighborhoods in Detroit.</p>
<p>The foreclosure crisis made it possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the foreclosed upon Southfield homes were going for $40,000 to $60,000. The median home value dropped from more than $190,000 to below $130,000 over the same period, according to Census figures.</p>
<p>With so many empty houses available, rents also dipped by hundreds of dollars. Renters increased from about 13,100 in 2006 to 15,400 in 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks, like all Americans, want good schools and a safe community, and they can find that in the suburbs,&#8221; says Richard Schragger, who teaches local government and urban law at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These were the things that prompted Richard Twiggs to leave Detroit 23 years ago for the safety, quiet and peace of mind Southfield offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason suburbs are the way they are is because a certain element can&rsquo;t afford to live in your community,&#8221; adds Twiggs, a 54-year-old printer. &#8220;If you have $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 homes you&rsquo;re relatively secure in the fact that (the homeowners) are people who can afford it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when you have this crash, people who normally couldn&rsquo;t afford to live in Southfield are moving in. When you have a house for $9,900 on the corner over there  &mdash;  that just destroys my property.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pride that comes with home ownership and a large financial investment in the property is missing, says Clanton, who lives across the street from Twiggs on Stahelin, about a half-mile north of Detroit. Back yards are deep and mostly tree-shaded. Sidewalks are few.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheryll Cashin, who teaches constitutional law and race and American law at Georgetown University, says it would be a shame if black flight from the city set off black flight from the near suburbs.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about time that civilized Blacks learned what all of us Whites have been complaining about. Maybe this will make them think twice before they vote for politicians that support programs that assist ghetto people in spreading their blight to good neighborhoods. </p>

		<p>It is remarkable, nay, unbeleivable how candidly some can speak of the well-known, well-documented, obnoxious behavior of blacks&hellip;so long as they themselves are black! If two plus two is four when a black man says it, why is it not also four when we whites say it?! Moreover, why then is is &#8220;evil&#8221; for whites to even say &#8220;four?&#8221; </p>

		<p>I am from Detroit and this is happening in all of the &#8220;inner ring&#8221; burbs.   </p>
<p>Blacks are moving to the burbs to get away from blacks.  The first blacks to move in to a white neighborhood are almost always very good people.  But as more and more move in, the schools begin to fail, crime goes up, property values go down and whites will no longer buy there and the whites already there, move out. The good blacks will stay there a long while, then move to another white area and the process starts over.  </p>
<p>In a few decades, this whole country is going to look like Detroit, Haiti, Liberia unless something changes.  There is no other possible outcome!   </p>
<p>This sums it all up<br>

		<p>Milwaukee and the suburbs, same story . Culture clash . I can never figure out where they get the money from . Party day and night and they still have cash and no job. Then they turn around and complain that the schools, stores and streets are not safe anymore. The same schools and such their own people just destroyed.<br>
We need to end welfare and end rent assistance.</p>

		<p>I remember back in 1985 when Judge Leonard Sands ordered the city of Yonkers to build low-income housing in the White parts of the city so ghetto riff raff could move in.  Naturally, the citizens of these areas protested loudly.  Leftists in turn, denounced them as &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also remember when Morton Downey Jr. (who had a talk show then) brought a number of these people on his show to air their grievances.  A minority of them were well-to-do blacks who had moved to these White areas to get away from this riff raff (as they freely admitted).</p>
<p>It goes back to what I&rsquo;ve always said: nobody likes blacks; they don&rsquo;t even like each other.</p>

<p>- If a white person said this exact same thing about blacks, he would be accused of being racist.  If a black man says it about other blacks, he gets a free pass and people try to understand his point of view.  The hypocrisy is huge!</p>
<p>The small town where I was born, which is far from any ghettos, has recently had some blacks move in here and there.  I cannot tell you the sorrow and consternation I feel every time I visit the old homestead and see someone who doesn&rsquo;t belong walking down the streets I used to play on as a child - when people trusted their neighbors and there was nearly zero crime.  Now I envision that beautiful place being a full-fledged gangland ghetto in 20 years.  It brings tears to my eyes, like I&rsquo;m losing something precious.</p>

		<p>So in other words, the better blacks are dragged down and overwhelmed by the far larger number of lower-class blacks. It&rsquo;s an old story  &mdash;  the old, sad tale of the entire black race. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that there are no good, hard-working blacks, but the larger number of not-so-hard working ones drag everyone else down. Then, as East Side Clyde wrote, the better blacks have to move to another white suburb and the whole cycle starts all over again.</p>

		<p>This very same thing has occurred in Memphis in the last 20-30 years.  What used to be upscaled white neighborhoods, are all black now, with blacks taking advantage of subsidized housing and all.  And typical of black neighborhoods, you see trash everywhere, uncut, grown up lawns, blacks walking up and down streets three and four abreast, so you have to carefully drive around them.  The houses, once nice dwellings, are now in disrepair, with multiple cars on the sidewalks, playing loud rap music.</p>

<p><br>
This is how race and integration have come to distort the issue.</p>
<p>I grew up in a nice, safe, clean suburb with excellent schools and services.   It was all white. My parents were far from well to do, but this was not about money.  Not back then. That was before government-imposed integration. </p>
<p>Now, it takes MONEY to escape the black plague, even for blacks!  If you don&rsquo;t have money,  whether you&rsquo;re  black or white, you&rsquo;re doomed to live in a festering ghetto and your children will be wiggers.</p>
<p>And, especially for white people, it&rsquo;s going to take more and more money, as time goes on, to escape the spreading blight. Eventually, only the  wealthy few - the ruling elite -  will be able to afford the luxury of escaping ghetto blacks and living among their own kind. A white neighborhood  (which was once just taken for granted) will be a luxury neighborhood.  Very few will be able to afford the privilege.</p>

		<p>Southfield, Redford, Hazel Park, and Highland Park are all just north of Detroit and have been bad for over a decade.  This is similar to certain downriver(south of Detroit) cities like Melvindale, Ecorse, Inkster, Taylor(most parts anyways), River Rouge, Romulus, Dearborn(Arab/Muslim capital of the U.S.), Dearborn Heights, and Lincoln Park.  </p>
<p>Interestingly enough Lincoln Park was/is always rated one of the worst public schools in the state of MI, even beating out quite a few Detroit public schools(they bus in a lot of Detroit kids).</p>
<p>Bottom line, these cities and towns are already done for and already implement &#8220;busing&#8221;.  No sane whites have moved to these cities in years, they have been looking to cities farther away for at least a decade.  The demographic shift is just now starting to show, but everyone that lives in the area saw this coming a mile away.  No surprise to locals.</p>

		<p>Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t read &#8220;Black Rednecks and White Liberals,&#8221; by Thomas Sowell simply must. As he writes, there has pretty much always been a black middle class, even at the height of slavery. They lived in Northern cities and made very few waves. It wasn&rsquo;t until the invention of the cotton gin and the death of the plantation that the undesirable blacks made their way north in the great migration. </p>
<p>I am experiencing something similar to what these upper crust blacks are now suffering. I live in a fairly middle-class neighborhood, yet the apartments ringing the township are filled with ghetto dwellers who fled the large project tenements and moved into townhouses using section eight vouchers. Whenever I drive down the block to the grocery store, I receive a gauntlet of hateful stares, blaring rap music, teens flagrantly walking in front of my car. This must stop.</p>

		<p>  I live in a suburb north of St. Louis. I have two black neighbors. Guess what? They moved from their previous homes because of crime, falling property values, and under-performing schools. No surprise that crime is up,etc.and etc. If you&rsquo;re white you have two choices. Buy rich or buy rural.</p>

		<p>The two black Americas mentioned by AR Poster (22) must be understood in the light of Affirmative Action and government hiring schemes which have created an entirely artificial black middle class and - in the bargain - institutionalized incompetance in the affected institutions.  If the federal government could somehow be forced to operate on the sort of budgets they were allowed only 50 years ago, this middle-class black America would find itself quickly whittled down to the much lower numbers of people who actually possess genuine intelligence and drive.<br>

		<p>During the long history of African blacks I&rsquo;m sure they produced<br>
numbers of high I.Q., innovative inividuals.  The local population didn&rsquo;t produce enough receptive minds to appreciate and support them.  The critical mass just wasn&rsquo;t there.<br>
Even direct contact with innovations from other races and cultures were only slowly and poorly utilized.<br>
This contrasts with the Caucasian and N.E. Asian populations who not only could innovate on their own, but could recognize good ideas from other cultures and adopt them.<br>
Unfortunately pampered generations of whites seem too willing to adopt the only thing blacks have to offer, which is behavior. </p>

		<p>Now that is one thing you can say about blacks, their idea of Moving Up to a better neighborhood never means moving to a inviting black neighborhood because a good black neighborhood doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist.</p>
<p>No their idea is to move into a nice, quiet, peachful, well maintained, white neighborhood where they can do what they do two things best.</p>
<p>1. Drive Home Values Way Up.<br>
2. Cause crime to plummet<br>

<p>&#8220;Why must the middle-class always have to flee?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, the white middle class is almost gone, so there will be no need for them to flee.  They are being replaced with those ghetto blacks who have, over the last 40 years and billions of dollars been culled from their ranks, given state and federal jobs, and represent those &#8220;nice blacks&#8221; who some posters think are alright.  Of course, as yet other posters point out, those &#8220;nice blacks&#8221; will be followed by the not so nice blacks.  In any case, even the &#8220;nice&#8221; blacks are a threat to whites genetically.  Meanwhile, some whites, joining in with others make the use of the epithet, &#8220;White Trash&#8221; to apply to the early white losers in the plot.</p>
<p>An article I found on CNN last week entitled, &#8220;How the Middle Class Became the Underclass&#8221; stated that there has been no increase in income for the private sector middle class since 1988.  Federal and State workers represent a taxpayer funded middle class, and therefore an artificial middle class.  This socialist supported middle class has allowed much of the ruin that we have seen culturally, because as some have posted or implied, &#8220;You can take the black out of the ghetto, but you can&rsquo;t take the ghetto out of the black.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I love this part that was snipped:</p>
<p>&#8220;(Professor of constitutional law and race and American law at Georgetown University Sheryll Cashin) says: &#8220;There is classism within the black community&hellip;middle-class blacks, like middle-class whites, are also put off by behavior of impoverished blacks who &#8216;have developed their own culture, one that is very different from mainstream America.&rsquo;<br>
&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To the higher income black people, if you don&rsquo;t want to love and help your lower-income black brethren, why would you expect white people to? If you can&rsquo;t do it, no one in society can do it.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, classism. People who have a little class don&rsquo;t want to be around people who don&rsquo;t have any. But at least the professor drifted into a little reality toward the end there.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t about class like some posters here seem to think, it&rsquo;s about race.  Having more money will not magically raise their IQs(which has been proven conclusively to be heritable) or erase their increased propensity for criminal behavior.  Sure those few rich black people might seem wonderful and preferable to &#8220;white trash&#8221;(the fact that you&rsquo;re comparing upper class blacks to white trash in the first place should tell you something), but will their kids be?  Will the ghetto blacks that inevitably come after them be?  The answer is no.</p>

<p>Actually class does come into play. No one is comparing upper class Blacks to White trash. They were comparing lower income, ghetto Blacks to White trash. You are deliberately distorting the arguement to suit your own agenda.</p>

<p>There are plenty of rich White kids who are dysfunctional and wayward. Paris Hilton anyone? As well as those who are much lesser known. There is no reason to beeive that wealthy Black children are any more unruly than spoiled rich White ones.In fact, I have met a number of upscale Blacks whose children are well behaved. The same can be siad for most upper income Whites for that matter.</p>
