<h1>Organization to Offer Scholarship for Caucasian Males</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Karen Buenrostro, University Star (Texas State University), February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Former Majority Association for Equality (FMAFE) organization is offering one of the first ethnically focused scholarships for underprivileged Caucasian males.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bohannan [Colby Bohannan, president of FMAFE] said the scholarship is not limited to Texas State students, and is geared towards individuals who have found the scholarship process difficult because they do not fit into certain categories or ethnic groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in equality for everyone, as well as being a strong believer that everyone should have an opportunity to attend college no matter who they are or where they come from,&#8221; said Calysta Spence, FMAFE fundraising coordinator.</p>
<p>The organization focuses on students dedicated to their own education, helping others and finding a successful career.</p>
<p>According to FMAFE&rsquo;s organizational website, they will award five candidates a $500 scholarship. Applicants should be at least 25 percent Caucasian, male, maintain a GPA exceeding 3.0, demonstrate a commitment to education and substantiate financial need to be eligible for these awards.</p>
<p>Calculating what constitutes 25 percent Caucasian decent has been a top priority of discussion but has not yet been established.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bohannan said the organization has not yet started accepting applications for the fall 2011 semester, and FMAFE is not affiliated with any student or campus organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The toughest obstacles to getting this organization off the ground seem to be not appearing racially motivated, and getting taken seriously,&#8221; Bohannan said. &#8220;The board members of FMAFE are not trying to put anyone down or make any race or cultures seem inferior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bohannan said FMAFE does not accept donations from any individual or group of people that are associated with racially bigotry.</p>
<p>The organization is based in San Marcos, and the staff is made up exclusively of volunteers. FMAFE&rsquo;s board of directors currently consists of seven individuals. Ford [Michael Ford, FMAFE&rsquo;s senior advisor] said a diverse group of board members is key to achieving an unbiased selection of scholarship winners, and serve a strong foundation to building a reputable organization.</p>

		<p>The 25% issue doesn&rsquo;t bug me that much, as most racially based scholarships seem have a clause where they have to let you in as long as you had at least one grandparent of X race.  I seem to recall one commenter here talking about how he was reviled by all the mestizos at the mandatory scholarship meetings because he looked 100% white, and only qualified because he had a hispanic(I think it was a Spaniard) grandparent and a Spanish last name.  </p>
<p>What does bug me is this - </p>
<p>&ldquo;The toughest obstacles to getting this organization off the ground seem to be not appearing racially motivated&#8221;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a SCHOLARSHIP BEING OFFERED ON THE BASIS OF RACE here.  How could it possibly NOT be racially motivated?  </p>

<p>Won&rsquo;t be long until FMAFE itself gets onto the SPLC&rsquo;s and ADL&rsquo;s rock em sock em mega mart everything must go list of extremist hate groups.  Sorry, FMAFE, no weaseling your way out of this   &mdash;   Any three white people gathered together by themselves or any one white person doing a good turn for another white person is automatically racial hatred.</p>

		<p>Malcolm X was 25% white. Obama 50%.</p>
<p>Louis Farrakhan and Jeremiah Wright are probably at least 25% white. </p>
<p>So I guess they would&rsquo;ve all qualified? </p>

		<p>I noticed on the original article there is a commenter who is vehemently arguing there shouldn&rsquo;t be ANY ethnic scholarships and they mention the UNCF as another example. But does anyone really believe that if you went to articles discussing UNCF you would find comments from that person making the same points? Nope. Because that person is being hypocritical.</p>

		<p>The FMAFE statements are incoherent.</p>
<p>They refer to Caucasians, but their 25% definition covers most African-Americans - not to mention the vast majority of individuals who have benefited from affirmative action in the United States.</p>
<p>The average African-American is around 22% Caucasian.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is an open secret that African-Americans who benefits from affirmative action are as a rule middle-class or upper-middle-class blacks mixed-race individuals who are at least 50% Caucasian, and many 80 or 90% Caucasian:</p>
<p>These are individuals with enough African genetic heritage to qualify for AA, and enough Caucasian genetic heritage to function as at least mediocre entitlement students (their lives are made easy by dumbed downed AA curricula, grade inflation, and collapsing academic standards generally).</p>
<p>With many race-based entitlement programs controlled by nonwhites, poor whites desperately need advocates and support prevents academically.</p>
<p>This organization doesn&rsquo;t seem to be interested in providing it.</p>

<p>There are different ways to take that. One is that wealthy African Americans are being given racial preferences over poor whites. </p>
<p>I kind of like this scholarship program, but as I&rsquo;ve said before. It will only be when white men are denied &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;, too, that these programs will begin to end. We&rsquo;ve had over 40 years of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; and all that goes with it. The sooner we ask for it ourselves, the better&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in &#8220;affrimative action&#8221; of any kind.  The whole concept is stupid.  But I must say that, as a white male preparing for college in a couple of years, it is a good thing for me that affirmative action is increasingly extending to whites.  Although, I would feel very immoral accepting money just because of my race and gender.</p>

		<p>Some people have accurately stated that a lot of blacks could qualify for this program - including Malcolm X and Obama. But people are missing the point. The scholarship really is very modest. All of them together only total $2500. But what it&rsquo;s really doing is opening the door and making it acceptable to offer scholarships to Caucasians. It may well be that someone of mixed race might win one occasionally. It&rsquo;s possible but I think it highly unlikely. At any rate, this is a brilliant tactic and a small price to pay for breaking down this barrier.</p>

		<p>People are making a really big deal out of the 25% thing&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s likely the scholarship will be awarded to white men, regardless of what might potentially meet the definition.  It says right in the article that they basically had to go out of their way to avoid being called racist.</p>

		<p>I love that race is a social construct but they can say a person can be 25 percent Caucasian and get away with it when they damn well know with their own rules no one is Caucasian unless they are socially considered Caucasian.</p>
<p>You either are considered white, or you are not - there is no in between.  If you have to explain it then you aren&rsquo;t considered white by society thus you are not afforded all the &#8220;privileges&#8221; of American society that white people are - whatever those might be, I still have yet to find out.</p>

		<p>I would define &#8220;white person&#8221; as one who is excluded from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Millennium Scholarship, as given by the first criteria under &#8220;Who is Eligible?&#8221; in &#8220;https://nominations.gmsp.org/GMSP_App/&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>Are African American, American Indian/Alaska Native*, Asian Pacific Islander American** or Hispanic American</i></p>
<p>So if you qualify as Hispanic, you can&rsquo;t qualify as white.  If you&rsquo;re a quadroon who can qualify for affirmative action as an African American, you&rsquo;re not white.</p>
<p>The 25% rule means that Obama&rsquo;s children can get this scholarship.</p>

		<p>I guess the huge f&rsquo;ing irony here is that if ANY percentage of &#8220;Caucasoid&#8221; blood is mixed with anything else..it&rsquo;s effectively lost. Meso-Americans are by definition at least hal-Spaniard/European, and most American blacks are 20-40% white. I don&rsquo;t consider the before-mentioned groups to be white. This isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;white&#8221; scholarship. It&rsquo;s a free-for-all. </p>
