<h1>A Very Successful Unsuccessful Conference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AR staff, <font color="&ldquo;red&rdquo;">Special to AR News,</font> February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite <a href="/" target="cancellation"><b>cancellation</b></a> of the full-scale American Renaissance conference scheduled for February 4 through 6 in Charlotte, North Carolina, the speakers gathered to hold what is becoming known as a very successful unsuccessful conference. The talks were a marvelous combination of politics, history, commentary, and inspiration. They were all professionally recorded and will be available soon as both Internet downloads and CDs. All participants greatly regretted that the approximately 200 people who had initially registered for the event were unable to attend.</p>
<p>The conference was opened by Filip Dewinter, one of the top leaders of the Vlaams Belang. The VB is the main opposition party in the Flemish parliament, and is one of many increasingly influential European parties devoted to strengthening European and regional identities and to protecting the continent from religious and demographic transformation.</p>
<p>In his talk, &#8220;The Colonization of Europe: How Europe Will Become Eurabia,&#8221; Mr. Dewinter described in chilling detail the Muslim tidal wave that is sweeping across Europe. In the very period when Europeans birthrates have dropped well below replacement levels, Muslim populations are surging, and are projected to reach 73 million by 2030. The admission of Turkey to the European Union would add yet another 80 million Muslims.</p>
<p>Mr. Dewinter decried the current fashion of multiculturalism which, he said, &#8220;attacks national identity the way AIDS attacks the body&rsquo;s immune system,&#8221; leaving Europeans defenseless against cultural invasion. But perhaps the most disturbing part of his talk consisted of quotations from Muslims themselves. Abu Imran, one of the Islamic leaders of Belgium has said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&rsquo;t rest until Europe has become an Islamic state. And then we will march on toward the White House and Vatican. We will carry out the promise of our dear Prophet. In a peaceful way, but we will continue until the Lord Grants us victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haouri Boumedienne, president of Algeria, has said:</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, millions of men will leave the Southern Hemisphere to go to the Northern Hemisphere. And they will not go there as friends. Because they will go there to conquer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recep Erdogan, the current prime minister of Turkey, makes no secret of his intentions: &#8220;Mosques are our barracks, domes our helmets, minarets our bayonets, believers our soldiers.&#8221; He has also said that &#8220;democracy is like a train, we shall get out when we arrive at the station we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, noted Mr. Dewinter, there many increasingly influential opposition parties in Europe in addition to his own, which are fighting what he called the &#8220;hereditary enemy of Europe&#8221;: the Northern League in Italy, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Swedish Democrats, the Danish People&rsquo;s Party, and others. They are joining forces across the continent to preserve the civilization and culture of the West.</p>
<p>The next speaker was South African Dan Roodt, the founder of the Pro-Afrikaans Action Group (PRAAG). In a very thought-provoking speech, &#8220;The White Man&rsquo;s Burden: How the Colonial Mentality Brought Down European Civilization,&#8221; Dr. Roodt described the mentality that led to the psychological capitulation of whites. He pointed out that despite ritual condemnation of &#8220;imperialism,&#8221; the white man&rsquo;s colonial burden really was one of uplift and dedication. He quoted Kipling: &#8220;Send forth the best ye breed/Go bind your sons to exile/To serve your captives&rsquo; needs.&#8221; Even after the end of colonialism, the former metropolitan countries supported their former charges through direct aid, medicine, and transfers of technology. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is an example of massive private charitable transfer to the Third World, especially to Africa.</p>
<p>At the same time, women in the West have largely abandoned their traditional role as homemakers, and many now put more effort into careers than into child-rearing. Dr. Roodt said it could even be argued that by seeking employment outside the home, white women have shouldered the burden of continued wealth transfers to the Third World.</p>
<p>In South Africa itself, whites are ruled by blacks who make no secret of their desire to Africanize the economy and culture. Virtually all salaried positions in government and large businesses are now filled by blacks, though whites can still offer expertise as consultants. He said that whites are now, in effect, the &#8220;intellectual slaves&#8221; of their black rulers. At the same time, whites pay in taxes 63 times more than the benefits they receive from government. Because of racial preferences and anti-white bias, there are now 700,000 poor whites, many of whom live in miserable shanty towns.</p>
<p>The dispossession of whites is symbolized in the most brutal way by the continued torture and slaughter of white farmers. As Dr. Roodt noted, the world looks on with indifference at this slow genocide of families who may have plowed the same earth for generations.</p>
<p>Dr. Roodt pointed out that South African and Zimbabwe are simply the end point of the trends set in motion throughout the West, as immigration thins the ranks of whites. The future of the West, he said, will be played out in the next 40 or 50 years, but the future of the Afrikaner will be decided in the next 2 to 5 years. &#8220;The lessons of our struggle will be invaluable for the coming existential war of the West,&#8221; he warned.</p>
<p>The next speaker, education expert Robert Greenberg, spoke about the lies whites seem to be compelled to tell to and about blacks. Michael Holzman of the Schott Foundation, he noted, claimed that 63 percent of blacks drop out of Chicago public schools because they do not have access to advanced math classes. Mr. Holzman never explained how students who are puzzled by basic math would be helped by advanced courses.</p>
<p>When Michigan voters banned racial preferences in higher education, the University of Michigan&rsquo;s president, Mary Sue Coleman, said the ban would set back the university&rsquo;s quest for intellectual excellence even though it was clear that the beneficiaries of preferences rarely met even minimal academic standards.</p>
<p>Dr. Greenberg argued that whites tell lies like this for several reasons: It is a way to endorse the black agenda and thereby take the side of the virtuous oppressed; it may be possible to say something slightly unpleasant about blacks if it is surrounded with flattering lies; saying fantastic things about blacks is a rite of passage that eases whites into the ranks of the elite. In a black humor vein, Dr. Geeenberg suggested that this may be a way some liberals vent their contempt for blacks  &mdash;  that a white who has gone before the NAACP to say that every black child has the brains to do well college may go home later and tell his wife that blacks are so stupid they actually believe this rubbish.</p>
<p>Dr. Greenberg was pessimistic about the likelihood of whites beginning to speak truthfully. Lies win plaudits, honors, and promotions, while the truth  &mdash;  which is usually unpleasant  &mdash;  is greeted with mock horror and obloquy. Lies will therefore continue to drive out truth, as the country continues its decline.</p>
<p>In a talk titled &#8220;The Current State of Race Relations,&#8221; Jared Taylor characterized the present age as one of &#8220;belief in miracles.&#8221; He recalled the rapture that greeted Mr. Obama&rsquo;s election and inauguration, and attributed it to the realization among Americans that race continues to be a colossal problem that cannot be solved without miracles. He listed a few of the miracles in which we must believe: that the effect of genes can be overcome by environment, that diversity can be transmuted from a weakness into a strength, and that a ballooning population will somehow not thwart our goal of energy independence nor burden the environment.</p>
<p>He noted that one &#8220;anti-miracle&#8221; the country actually can count on is the sustained cowardice and stupidity of whites. He cited the vote in Congress last year to remove the ban on racial discrimination from the enabling legislation of the Coast Guard Academy. The academy is now officially free to discriminate in its admissions, prompting the black congressman Elijah Cummings to say with a straight face that blacks are now finally ensured of federal protections against discrimination. Mr. Taylor noted that 86 percent of US senators and congressmen are still white, and wondered what they thought as they voted for a provision that was clearly meant to discriminate against their own children.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor chided some race realists for believing in their own miracle: that the economic and social systems will soon collapse, and that a strong white racial consciousness will emerge from the rubble. Instead, he urged whites to take advantage of the rising anger against the direction in which the country is moving and to undertake the hard, painstaking work of politics. Even just a few race realists on school boards or city councils would have a huge psychological and propaganda effect, and would begin to channel current frustrations in promising directions.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor concluded by saying that although times have never been better for success, the chances of success do not matter because whites have a duty to their ancestors and to their descendants to work for the preservation of their people and culture.</p>
<p>Attorney Hugh Kennedy described the prospects for hate-speech legislation in the United States and ways to resist it. He pointed out that the robust First Amendment protections we take for granted are the result of judicial rulings that are surprisingly recent and vulnerable. In fact, only a few years after the adoption of the First Amendment, Supreme Court justices presided over Sedition Act trials that were plainly repugnant to the First Amendment as we understand it today. The rationale for these trials was that the amendment prohibited only prior restraint of certain kinds of speech, not punishment after the fact. It was not until 1931 that the Supreme Court struck down a government act as inconsistent with freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy suggested how a future Supreme Court might subvert its own, recent precedents and uphold a hate-speech law. One approach would simply purport to return to a pre-1931 &#8220;original understanding&#8221; or prior-restraint conception of the free speech clause. The Court could even point to the 1952 Beauharnais decision, which upheld an Illinois hate-speech law and has never been expressly overturned. The Court could also adopt Justice Ginsburg&rsquo;s recommendation that our courts pay more attention to European law, which overwhelmingly favors hate-speech legislation. Mr. Kennedy nevertheless pointed out that the Court&rsquo;s rulings that set an &#8220;imminent threat of lawlessness&#8221; standard for suppression of political speech are very strong, as is the American culture of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy also described less direct means of government interference with speech, including enforcement of foreign hate-speech judgments in US courts, hate-crimes prosecutions, and federal, state, and local campaigns of harassment, defamation and surveillance. Mr. Kennedy urged the potential targets of hate-speech legislation to use the judicial system vigorously to resist such efforts. The affected groups may lack resources and experience with the system, but useful allies may be found among civil rights groups that often are hostile on other issues. Mr. Kennedy warned that cynicism about the courts does not excuse passivity in the face of threats to our freedom to speak.</p>
<p>Raymond Wolters spoke about some the work he has done for his forthcoming book, tentatively titled, <cite>Profiles in School Reform.</cite> He plans to devote a chapter to the arguments of race realists and their attempts to end the blackout on the question of race and IQ. He noted that the mainstream media give the impression that only a few &#8220;maverick&#8221; psychometricians think race has any link to IQ, but that ever since the famous  &mdash;  but anonymous  &mdash;  Snyderman and Rothman survey of 1988, this has been proven completely wrong.</p>
<p>The pressure of ignorant conformity is immense. Even James Watson, the Nobel-prize-winning discoverer of the double helix, could not endure the torrent of criticism he suffered when he suggested that the genes for intelligence would eventually be discovered and would be found to be unequally distributed in different populations. He apologized &#8220;unreservedly,&#8221; and claimed &#8220;there is no scientific basis&#8221; for the views he expressed.</p>
<p>Prof. Wolters also spoke of Chinese-American Professor Bruce Lahn&rsquo;s research, which found evidence for racial variation in the distribution of mutations that affect brain development. At first, in the face of criticism, Prof. Lahn stood his ground, saying that &#8220;society will have to grapple with some very difficult facts,&#8221; but he, too, recanted, concluding that &#8220;some knowledge might not be worth having.&#8221; </p>
<p>Prof. Wolters gave other examples of submission to dogma but closed with the more encouraging example of John Derbyshire, who spoke about racial differences to the Black Law Students Association of the University of Pennsylvania. His comments were received politely by the students, and despite criticism, Mr. Derbyshire retains his position as one of <cite>National Review</cite>&rsquo;s best-known writers. He even received much praise for speaking the truth and refusing to back down.</p>
<p>Prof. Wolters concluded that the arguments for race realism are strong and widely known, and that society will eventually have to grapple with them.</p>
<p>David Yeagley, the great-great-grandson of the Comanche leader Bad Eagle, spoke movingly in a talk entitled, &#8220;A Comanche View of White America,&#8221; which was received with a standing ovation. He began by explaining that even as a young child, he was vividly aware of the threats to his people and culture. When his grade school teacher asked the otherwise all-white class to draw pictures to encourage fire prevention, he drew teepees engulfed in flames, along with the words, &#8220;Stop this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, despite the dispossession of the Indian by the white man, Dr. Yeagley cannot bring himself to hate whites; he admires them. He noted that no other conquering people ever named its states, cities, rivers, and even athletic teams and advanced weapons after a conquered enemy. To call an attack helicopter the Apache, he said, is to pay homage to the bravery and prowess of the defeated enemy.</p>
<p>Dr. Yeagley fully recognizes the crisis the now-denatured white man has created for himself, as he lets others push him off his own land. The great tragedy is that although the Indian fought valiantly to protect his land, the white man has lost his warrior virtues and is giving up without a struggle. The American white man, said Dr. Yeagley, has voluntarily become the &#8220;Indian of the 21st Century,&#8221; adding, &#8220;Let me be the first to welcome you onto the reservation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberals, he said, have made Indians their favorite anti-white mascots and cannot comprehend an Indian who admires the warrior qualities of the white man of old. Conservatives, as well, shut their ears when an Indian warns them that they are destroying their country through immigration. Dr. Yeagley said that he used to speak often to conservative and neo-con groups, but that invitations are drying up. He added that after having listened to conference speakers from South Africa, Europe, and the United States describe the threats to white civilization, he found the invitation to speak at an <cite>American Renaissance</cite> conference to be perhaps the most rewarding of his career. </p>
<p>Adrian Davies, a British trial lawyer, spoke about nationalist developments in Europe. He noted that although generous welfare cushions the blows of economic hard times better than in the United States, the current crisis was causing many Europeans to rethink the directions in which their nations are heading. He noted the significance of Britain&rsquo;s Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron&rsquo;s recent concession that &#8220;multiculturalism has failed.&#8221; He added that although British elites can insulate themselves from the effects of demographic transformation, the common people now understand that many aspects of Third-World immigration are incompatible with British values.</p>
<p>Mr. Davies surveyed the recent progress of nationalist parties in such places as Austria, Switzerland, France, and Eastern Europe, but lamented the inability of some nationalists to set aside ancient quarrels in the name of a united front in defense of Europe. He pointed out that, for example, the Hungarian nationalists of Jobbik are at daggers drawn with the Slovak National Party because it supports the mandatory use of the Slovak language, which Jobbik considers a form of oppression of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. It also has a dispute with the otherwise largely compatible Greater Romania Party over Transylvania. German and Polish nationalists disagree about the border that was redrawn after the Second World War.</p>
<p>The unfortunate effect is that nationalists have had great difficulty establishing parliamentary groups in the European Parliament, which confer considerable powers and privileges. Nationalists may also be unable to put together a single list for future elections to the Euro-Parliament in which some seats will be reserved for groups capable of agreeing an Europe wide single list, but Mr. Davies expressed the hope that Europeans will soon settle these family squabbles and unite to preserve the West. </p>
<p>Sam Dickson, who has addressed every AR conference since the first one in 1994, began by noting that the cancellation of the 2011 conference showed just how unsure of itself today&rsquo;s racial orthodoxy has become. The city of Charlotte fears us and wants to suppress us precisely because our ideas are powerful and our vision is clear.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickson then made a heartfelt statement about the goals of our movement. He first noted that we should not be called &#8220;race realists&#8221; but, instead, &#8220;racial communitarians&#8221; or &#8220;racial idealists.&#8221; He pointed out that a sense of community with one&rsquo;s racial kin is healthy and normal, and argued that to ask whites to turn their backs on their race and people is like asking parents to turn their backs on their own children.</p>
<p>He said he longed for a white ethnostate that would be a home for all whites  &mdash;  rich and poor, conservative and liberal, hetero- and homosexual, brilliant and slow  &mdash;  in which they could be confident that their traditions and peoplehood would flourish. He pointed out that only an ethnostate can practice a genuine tolerance for all, as opposed to the brittle, agonizing &#8220;tolerance&#8221; of the multi-cultural experiment. Whereas an ethnostate automatically accepts and nurtures all its members, an &#8220;idea nation&#8221; of the kind proposed for the United States is constantly fractured by the incompatible demands of warring ethnicities. Ironically, he added, it is only ethnostates that can preserve the true and beautiful diversity of man, which is destroyed in the multi-culti mish-mash.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickson described the creation of the state of Israel, reestablished after 2000 years of diaspora, as the most powerful expression of peoplehood in the history of the world. In that sense, he said, racial idealists are Euro-Zionists, striving for a land that reflects our values and aspirations, just as Israel reflects the values and aspirations of its people. His conclusion of the conference was met with a sustained standing ovation.<br>

		<p>By forcing the cancellation of the American Renaissance conference the enemies of American Renaissance have brought that organization to the attention of many Americans who did not previously know of it, and guaranteed a larger public for the views that would have been expressed at the conference.<br>
 <br>
Those who maintain that IQ does not matter, that race does not matter, that &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same under the skin,&#8221; and so on cannot keep maintaining that in the face of a growing body of evidence that it is not true. That is why they try to suppress contrary evidence. Nevertheless, there is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come. <br>

		<p> Very interesting and enlightening report. But it&rsquo;s still a shame that some way was not found to hold the planned conference, Charlotte Leftists or no Charlotte Leftists. It would have been the sweetest kind of revenge on them; we should have had some kind of a back-up plan.</p>
<p> The tone of much of the article does leave a racial realist, or racial idealist, like myself, rather depressed, though. It seems that everywhere we turn, we are being shouted down or intimidated by the left. Or, rather, the owners of the public venues where we attempt to hold our conferences always cave in to Leftist pressure aimed at silencing us. We were once meeting in conference halls while Leftists attempted to make a scene outside in the street. Now they have succeeded in denying us even the right to meet. So, what&rsquo;s next, folks? Has no one a word of encouragement for us? No reassurance that if we persevere, things will get better?</p>
<p> It seems to me that, all too often, the Left is being allowed to win these confrontations by default. There is an organization called the Sons of Confederate Veterans, with local posts in all the Southern states. This organization is a direct celebration and recognition of the Confederacy, with all that means in today&rsquo;s politically correct America. Yet, have you ever heard of one of their meetings being disrupted, of anyone being intimidated into not letting them use a venue to hold such meetings? No. You know why? Because the Leftists know that if they tried direct confrontation with the SCV, they&rsquo;d likely get shot. We race realists could learn something from those descendants of Confederate soldiers. </p>

<p>He&rsquo;s more right than he knows.  In the American experience since 1900, upheaval, even as mild as it seems compared to other countries, always accrues to the benefit of the political left wing.</p>

		<p>I was one of the die-hards who refused to accept the cancelation of the conference and went to Charlotte anyway. Why were we not allowed to see or meet the speakers? What&rsquo;s going on? A fair number of really dedicated people apparently got the cold shoulder from the AR leadership. We want an explanation. How &#8216;bout it?</p>

<p>I must respectfully disagree with Mr. Taylor.  IF anyone identified their self as a race realist and sought a place on the any public platform, or even tried to do it clandestinely, they would be hunted and ejected after the regular application of the usual names and accusations, with the possibility of the word also getting back to their places of employment and seeing them loose their jobs.</p>
<p>This society and world society is going to collapse, and sooner than not, just figuring on the increasing weight of the humans on the systems in place and the financial impossibility faced at every turn.  Right now, the stock markets are forming a new bubble of business based on the premise that for example, Chinese people will continue to buy U.S. cars because the U.S. is bled dry yet.  The business world, smelling fresh cash, have become somewhat forgetful, but the problems with debt and the next set of disasters and bubble collapse will finish it off.  What I doubt is that a strong white identity will emerge. None of the retrogressive thinking I have seen on Amren posts for years now leads me to think that anything but a dog eat dog reality with the strong taking from the weak will exist as it does today, but on a more basic level, with whites taking from whites and leaving them out because they don&rsquo;t believe the same nonsense religious sect.</p>
<p>With so many &#8220;racial realists&#8221; checked out on Superbowl Sunday, I don&rsquo;t think that the realist part of the name is all that overarching.</p>

<p>Funny, except for the sometimes ridiculous statements made by some Indian revisionists, I have long felt that those of us with American ancestry going back to the 19th century and further back have much in common with the Amerind.  I do envy them their reservations, funding and grants.  I wish he was serious.  I would give up my world in the multicultural quagmire to fish, hunt, and dance with others who actually grew up loving this land, I mean the LAND, if I (and my wife) were truly welcomed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I see this as a form of capitulation in itself. There is a lot of great, historic architecture in the Western (white) world, as compared to the bland glass boxes that are the standard today. Think the Woolworth building, colonial Williamsburg, Monticello, and many others in the US alone. How would this ever be re-created in a new white homeland? Why should whites give up their historic homelands anyway? </p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor chided some race realists for believing in their own miracle: that the economic and social systems will soon collapse, and that a strong white racial consciousness will emerge from the rubble. Instead, he urged whites to take advantage of the rising anger against the direction in which the country is moving and to undertake the hard, painstaking work of politics. Even just a few race realists on school boards or city councils would have a huge psychological and propaganda effect, and would begin to channel current frustrations in promising directions.<br>

		<p>There was another conference in Charlotte, that took place at the same time.  It was composed of regular people who had decided to defy the odds and meet up anyway.  We had come from the West Coast, the Midwest, Texas and elsewhere to show our solidarity and support.  We had speakers and Paul Fromm was kind enough to grace us with his presence and even gave a couple of speeches himself.  On Sunday, we hit the streets and picketed the airport Sheraton - which had cancelled.  Passers-by gave us thumbs up and it was a lot of fun.  Images and videos to come!</p>

<p>I would like ask Dr. Yeagley how he feels about White dispossession.  What does he envision for the future of his people when Whites are a hated minority in a few years?  How does he think his people will fare when they (along with us) are lorded over by hostile non-Whites?</p>
<p><i>At the same time, women in the West have largely abandoned their traditional role as homemakers, and many now put more effort into careers than into child-rearing&hellip; by seeking employment outside the home, white women have shouldered the burden of continued wealth transfers to the Third World.</i></p>
<p>Dr. Roodt:  Maybe we White women wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to seek employment outside of the home if our socialist government weren&rsquo;t taxing us to death.  </p>
<p>Maybe we Whites would have more children if we didn&rsquo;t have to seek out increasingly expensive safe White areas with &#8220;good&#8221; schools in which to put our children; if we didn&rsquo;t have to pay private school tuition for our children to avoid the hostile and anti-, non-White public schools.</p>
<p>Maybe we Whites would have move children if we didn&rsquo;t have to support so many non-White welfare parasites who freely have as many children as they wish without regard to cost.  Those who cannot feed, educate or clothe themselves, let alone any dependents, are the ones having children because the government has become the de facto support for these families, and, in fact, makes it easy for them to reproduce.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s answer:  Higher taxes, more refugees, more Section 8 housing forced into White areas, more multi-culti indoctrination in the schools.</p>
<p>All of these things are destroying White families.  That along with the efficacy of bringing White children into an increasingly non-White/ White-hating world.</p>
<p>Maybe if the government would take its boot off our necks we would start to do better.</p>

		<p>when Amram was launched, the vast majority of the United States was still white.</p>
<p>we are now careening toward minority status, and many European countries are sleepwalking towatd the cliff edge as well.</p>
<p>in other words:</p>
<p>it is no longer a question of defeating an insane idea, the way it was in the 1950s, 60s, etc., the facts on the ground are now overwhelmingly against the preservation of European civilization.</p>
<p>the fact that American Renaissance cannot hold a public meeting means that there is NO!!!! public space available for the minority view at all.</p>
<p>it will take a dramatic breakthrough in public life to change this.</p>
<p>a significant number of influential scientists coming out publicly for an open and honest recognition of racial difference might be capable of triggering such a watershed moment. </p>
<p>policy shifts on immigration and quotas could then rest on a scientific basis.</p>
<p>the idea of abandoning Boston, Paris, London, Manhattan, Florence, the national parks, etc. in order to establish white reservations seems quite depressing.</p>
<p>on the other hand, if the message gets through to whites that there&rsquo;s a possibility of preserving our way of life after all, it might trigger widespread rebellion.</p>
<p>right now, whites as a group are suicidally passive. </p>
<p>the top priority - the only priority - of Amren &amp; other such groups should be finding a way to revived the comatose patient in time.</p>
<p>my first concrete suggestion is to form an international network of support groups where recovering liberals can meet face-to-face and discuss their ideas and opinions:</p>
<p>race realists anonymous.</p>
<p>my second is a for the rights of indigenous European peoples that would use the entire arsenal of civil rights law. </p>

<p>Mr. Taylor:  As you well know, one risks public scorn and derision for speaking out on behalf of Whites   &mdash;   possible loss of career and physical assault as well.</p>
<p>With that said, there are a brave few standing up to the government-enforced Reign of Terror:</p>
<p><i>Steve Smith, A3P State Chair of Pennsylvania, has stolen the show at a recent taping of &#8216;Why Does NEPA [Northeast Pennsylvania] Hate?&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8216;I teach at a predominantly white institution, and I constantly teach my students about white privilege,&rsquo; added Cannady, Associate Professor at Lock Haven University</i></p>
<p><i>Her remarks were met with criticism by Steve Smith, who was in the audience. Smith introduced himself as, &#8216;the State Chairman for the American Third Position&hellip;an organization that advocates on behalf of white Americans.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8216;White privilege?&rsquo;, he asked. &#8216;That seems like a hateful term. Just because we&rsquo;re white we&rsquo;re privileged?&rsquo;Smith continued, &#8216;The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that you say you teach white kids they&rsquo;re privileged to be white. That&rsquo;s instilling white guilt.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Cannady mumbled, &#8216;I didn&rsquo;t say that.&rsquo;</i></p>

<p>Right On and Kudos to the very brave Mr. Smith!  It&rsquo;s high time these egomaniacal lefties had their lies shoved down their throats.</p>

<p>Exactly, Tim. Except as a forced fallback position I never understood why some WNs go on, romantically sometimes, about a new white homeland, like the Pacific Northwest (which is filling up with Asians from what I read). We are way ahead of ourselves on that. Our countries not just in Europe but anywhere else we built a civilization out of the wilderness are our cultural heritage and our identity. Besides which there are strategic considerations. For example, New York is the worlds largest natural harbor. In fact all our coastlines here in the U.S. are vitally important to trade and defense. Want us to be a landlocked people while the Chinese take over all that real estate and choke us into submission? It would be the greatest and final White Flight, right into oblivion.</p>

		<p>I am in agreement with Whiteplight. </p>
<p>Jared, here is where I think you are wrong. I understand the motivation for raising the IQ and race issue. For people who push it- such as yourself- it comes down to $$$$$$. If it is an indisputable scientific fact that Hispanics and Blacks are less intelligent than Whites, than no amount of $$$$$ will fix this problem. Here is the problem with this strategy. Hispanics and Blacks will never except it. Moreover, in places where they are a racial majority, they can vote overwhelmingly against this point of view. They will flex their political muscle on the issue. Look at what happened in NH. The majority Hispanic school board go rid of all the White teachers in the school system( I realize that it was Obama supporting White Liberal teachers who were fired..I am just making a point about racial political clout).</p>
<p>The race and IQ issue is not really the fundmental issue facing Native Born White Americans. The fundamental issue facing Native Born White Americans is local race-replacement and the transfer of poltical power that comes along with it. The race and IQ issue is just the beside the point. They can force a minority Native Born White American population in a some town,city,county or state to subsidize the local Hispanic and Black school age population. The only option that White Americans have is pack up and leave. The much more fundamental issue is the formation-well beyond the nascent stage in 2011- of several distinct race-based nation states within the borders of America. This is completely a consequence of post-1965 immigration policy.</p>
<p>Next point.Well, the catastrophes have appeared in the last ten years-big ones,medium ones..and much bigger ones no doubt in the near future. I maintain that there is a much higher level of racial conciousness among White Americans than there was in 1990&hellip;.and we certainly know what the proxies for this are&hellip;the race-replacement enthusiasts certainly do. You are assuming that there is no end as to what White Americans will put up with. I think this assumption is obviously false. There is only a very thin veneer of civility coating US society in 2011&hellip;and it was briefly blown off for a few weeks starting on 9/11 and the month afterwards. There is very compelling evidence for this. The Bush adminstration had to work very hard- and very quickly- to wrap it back on again the day after 9/11.</p>

<p>Nothing demonstrates the truth of this quite so well as Amren&rsquo;s unwillingness to camp out in the parking lot of the hotel that cancelled the conference. Then have the conference right there in the parking lot of that hotel that cancelled the conference.  MAKE a scene!!  MAKE them arrest you for trespassing!!

		<p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of Amren, for making the best of difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s simply no getting around the fact that this was an embarrassing defeat for our side. As Wayne Engle has pointed out, there should have been a backup plan in place.  Although it&rsquo;s easy for me   &mdash;   or anyone else   &mdash;   to analyze the Charlotte debacle with the hindsight eyes of an armchair quarterback, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that, after the events surrounding last year&rsquo;s conference, it&rsquo;s truly puzzling why <i>no</i> one seems to have prepared any alternative strategies.  There is nothing our side needs more at the moment than a few conspicuous successes, to stir up action among concerned Whites.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m really glad the comments I have read mirror my own beliefs. I say that Amren needs to connect with as many like minded groups as possible. Have you ever considered Libertarian groups? I think there is enough similarity in their beliefs as your/our own.</p>
<p> I also think that people who believe in maintaining the White European culture in America need to follow the same rule books as the Lefties. Try to &#8220;sneak&#8221; into the cultural psyche by writing or pressuring Text book companies to print the truth, work toward getting as many teachers and or educators who are sympathetic to the cause hired in school districts. Start large home schooling programs. </p>
<p>I also believe there needs to be a more revolutionary side think Westboro Baptist Church. be out in the open and sue, sue, sue! have those who are able and will not lose their jobs picketing NAACP rallies and NOI meetings if assaulted sue until these organizations have nothing left. There are a few biker groups that would gladly provide security. </p>
<p>There needs to be a symptomatic plan to take back the United States and restore order. Have a long term soft approach and a short term very verbal, very litigious shock troopers for the short term goal of creating an existing White Rights group that matters and can not be ignored.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the fighting spirit!!! Keep agitating. We need to embolden our fellow Native Born White Americans to to fight back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my comments in post 20 to be taken as a call for avoiding political participation. My point is there is room for different strategies to be taken simultaneously. We can rev up the revolt against race-replacement in a parallel processing mode. We have the core to do it. Certaintly a White Nationalist state legislator would help evolve the situation forward..the more the better.</p>
<p>We need to write of the Senate and the Presidency completely. There needs to be a devolution of political power away from deeply entrenched corporation owned poltical power. I am willing to write off the Congress and Governor. Although, if someone can  convince me not to write these two off..I&rsquo;ll listen. Real poltical power must devolved to ordinary and highly vigilent Naive Born White Americans. Of course, what I am hinting at is the anarchist vision of a self-governing people&hellip;..we should work to approximate this as closely as possible. </p>

WV is a poor state, so they will not be inclined to reject the extra revenue the Conference will offer. And WV is 96% white.<br>

How will we respond? It&rsquo;s important to raise the subject because much is going on at the subconscious and non-rational levels. Many of us might start changing our behavior and beliefs without really being aware of it. For example, an attack like this can either increase or decrease a person&rsquo;s allegiance to the cause.

&#8220;Even James Watson, the Nobel-prize-winning discoverer of the double helix, could not endure the torrent of criticism he suffered when he suggested that the genes for intelligence would eventually be discovered and would be found to be unequally distributed in different populations. He apologized &ldquo;unreservedly,&rdquo; and claimed &ldquo;there is no scientific basis&rdquo; for the views he expressed.&#8221;<br>
No surprise that the weasle Watson so willingly displayed his talent at backpeddling.  This &#8220;discoverer&#8221; of the double helix is actually a thief who dealt in the stolen the property of a female colleaque named Rosalind Franklin.  Her untimely death, likely caused by the effects of the X-ray crystallographic technique that she specialized in made it that much easier for Mr. Weasle, er, Watson to perpetuate his fraud.

<p>#6 Gerald Dubose Martin commented:<br>
 &#8220;I was one of the die-hards who refused to accept the cancelation of the conference and went to Charlotte anyway. Why were we not allowed to see or meet the speakers? What&rsquo;s going on? A fair number of really dedicated people apparently got the cold shoulder from the AR leadership. We want an explanation. How &lsquo;bout it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Martin, I for one am greatly encouraged to read that you went to Charlotte.  I, too, was registered for the conference and very excited at the prospect of attending my first AR conference.  When I received Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s Feb. 1 e-mail re the necessary cancellation, I figured that was it, it&rsquo;s off.  You and the others who actually showed up anyway are an inspiration!  I can&rsquo;t fault Mr. Taylor for handling the conference as he did, although I would sure-as-heck have loved to have been part of that meeting.  I credit him for pulling it together in the first place and eventually gathering the speakers as he did.  The good news is that those men held their meeting, albeit in somewhat of a clandenstine fashion.</p>
<p>Take heart my friend.  Look at the impact that Thilo Sarrazan&rsquo;s book is having across the EU (best seller in Germany).  Just consider the guts of Thilo Sarrazan to write the book!  Listen to the comments made by Angela Merkel and David Cameron re the failure of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; in their respective countries.  Now the left in the U.S. is having to resort to using elected officials (Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Cannon) to stop an AR conference.  It appears to me that that we are seeing the first light of a new day.</p>
<p>Do you know what his (failed) Charlotte mayoral campaign used to advertize Patrick Cannon&rsquo;s candidacy several years ago?  You guessed it.  A photo of large civil war-style cannon!  Aimed at I-77 from a full sized billboard just south of uptown Charlotte.  How does that compare to putting a rifle scope over a map position on a website political campaign graphic? </p>
<p>And even if we were losing this war of ideas, it&rsquo;s our duty to fight on.  So keep your chin up, and your powder dry.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the people here who are equating the notion of forming a white ethnostate with that of surrender.  What we need is time to consolidate and build our numbers(by having white babies, lots and lots of white babies), and when we&rsquo;re ready we&rsquo;ll simply take back what was rightfully ours.  The Amish(or at least the Old Order, forgive me if I&rsquo;m wrong as it&rsquo;s been a while since I read about them) descend from two hundred individuals, now they number in the hundreds of thousands - and with a yearly growth rate of 4% and an average of 6.8 children per family they&rsquo;re one of the fastest growing population groups on the planet.  Four out of five stay within the church, and I remember reading a quote that stated the rate of interracial marriage among the Amish is less than 2%.</p>
<p>Since when is a strategic retreat the same as waving the white flag?</p>

<p>I understand your well justified disgust. However, one can overdue it with the negativity- it&rsquo;s- all- over stuff. We can state in very concrete terms what has to be preserved and state-at least in very general terms-the strategy for reversing the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Specifically, what has to die is the popular culture of the United States. And I should call it &#8220;culture&#8221; instead of culture. And it was on full display on Superbowl Sunday.</p>
<p>If you think about, you are really asking the following question:&#8221;why does the crud continue day in and day out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is the answer:When the Republican and Democratic DC beltway consensus can no longer deliver the goods, the game is over.</p>
<p>The message and example White Nationalist-the revolt against race replacement-should send to our fellow White Americans is this:either we fight back or we die. By fighting back publicly against race-replacement we set a strong example with the intent of emboldening and racially radicalizing out fellow Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>The full magnitude of the impending final catastrophe hasn&rsquo;t fully sunk deep into the heads of millions of Native Born White Americans. When it does, America will spontaneously combust (Socio-cultural second order phase transition into a new configuration.) It would not be the first time in human history that this as happened. It is going on right now in Egypt.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a second order phase transition is, look it up.</p>
<p>American society is out of the equilibrium state. The Hopi have a term for this called: Qaoniskatsi (I&rsquo;m not spelling it the right way, but it is phonetically correct). It means out of balance.</p>

		<p>The Hopi word I mentioned in my previous post is Koyaanisqatsi which means:Life out of balance. It is also the title of the Godfrey Reggio movie(music by Phillip Glass). I higly recommend seeing Koyaanisqatsi.</p>
<p>Superbowl Sunday:Koyaanisqatsi. One can easily list many other examples of the Koyaanisqatsi phenomena in America circa 2011.</p>

		<p>The next American Renaissance conference should be scheduled for a city with a majority of Republican registered voters, a sympathetic news media, and a large population of white blue collar workers. White blue collar workers are more likely to feel threatened by Hispanic immigration and black crime than are affluent whites, even affluent whites who vote Republican. <br>
 <br>
One does not get places in politics by changing people&rsquo;s minds, but by articulating and channeling sentiments that already exist. American Renaissance should fish where the fish bite the bait, rather than the fishers. </p>

Fellow twenties(early) poster here, I sympathize with you immensely. Though for me it&rsquo;s been less about having a career and more about managing to find a woman who doesn&rsquo;t want to put off having kids for over a decade, as well as have more than one or two of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. As I said, if it were my choice I would be married right now and I would be happily reproducing. </p>
<p>Sometimes I don&rsquo;t think older people understand how things are these days. Women don&rsquo;t get married to a man just so they can get married. Today marriage is based on affection and love. And both partners equally like each other. For me, it isn&rsquo;t just some charming man who approaches my father at the town barn dance and tells him about all the acreage he is inhereting. For men, they don&rsquo;t just pursue the blushing maiden they saw milking the cow as they were strolling to work.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish we could go back to those times.  Sometimes I would even go back to the match making days. I find it a bit healthier than what we have now. </p>
<p>But as much as we want to fight it, this isn&rsquo;t the world we live in anymore. You and I, Mike, are both in our twenties and we understand this. It wasn&rsquo;t our choice to not get married to someone at 18.</p>
<p>There are too many factors in today&rsquo;s society that determine when you get married. First of all, 50% of it depends on the other person too. You both are equally meant to be together. You both have to be at the right place at the right time to run into each other. With college and so many other things being a priority, mostly from the persistence of our parents, it is almost impossible to predict when it is in your life that you run into that person.</p>
<p>I get irritated when my great grandmother nags me on finding a man (by today&rsquo;s standards I am still very young), when she doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand that finding a marriage partner in today&rsquo;s world depends on so many factors that are out of my control. It happens when it is supposed to happen. It doesn&rsquo;t happen when I choose for it to happen.</p>
<p>And white women like me have as equally a hard time as men like you. I have dated white men who are turned off when I tell them my traditional views on marriage (how a woman should stay at home with the kids).  In today&rsquo;s society it is just harder and harder to produce this perfect white utopia by having lots of babies, and both genders need to change their attitudes before we can get to that point. And as Bon pointed out, it doesn&rsquo;t help that whites are taxed to death.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t like it when men in this movement automatically assume &#8220;too many white women aren&rsquo;t getting married early because they are feminists&#8221;.  As I said, I despise feminism, and I agree it is partly to blame.  But number one, as I demonstrated above from my own dating experiences, men are just as equally to blame with their &#8220;anti-traditionalist&#8221; attitudes. And number two, there are lots of women who are single due to circumstances and not their own choices.</p>

		<p>@Freedom for All- We did secure a venue and invited the AmRen speakers to come. They didn&rsquo;t want to. They preferred to sit in their own hotel and talk to each other rather than give even 5 minutes of face time to those of us who did show up. As for the women, they were all over at our alternate venue.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m distressed that a small number of hopeful attendees actually showed up and Amren was not able to make arrangements for them to hear the speakers. I hope that Amren won&rsquo;t emulate our government&rsquo;s practice of non-transparency, but will give an honest explanation of why those who showed up were not able to be accommodated. </p>
<p>I assume that Mr. Taylor and Mr. Webster were pretty much managing everything without much assistance, and I can imagine that with all they had to attend to, they may have found themselves without sufficient time at the last minute to find a venue for a &#8220;mini conference&#8221; in a city where so much publicity had occurred, in contrast to what they were able to arrange last year in the northern Va. area when last year&rsquo;s conference was cancelled. There, we were able to hold a very satisfying mini-conference in the meeting room of a nearby restaurant.</p>
<p>I imagine that those who showed up this year were guided in their hopes by knowledge of the successful mini-conference last year in northern Va. I hope that Amren will address their disappointment, not only out of courtesy, but also to avoid their experience becoming an ongoing sore point. In my experience, what&rsquo;s best when something like this occurs is open honesty and a plea for understanding and (if appropriate) forgiveness.</p>

		<p>COMFORTABLY ANONYMOUS, Thanks for your comments &amp; encouragement - they are helpful. I&rsquo;m in the process of getting a satisfactory explanation (with the assistance of jewamongyou) to why the die-hards didn&rsquo;t get to meet the speakers. It appears to be a result of the confusion of having two more or less secret meetings going on at the same time, security worries, and a lack of or mis-communication between Jared Taylor &amp; his lieutenants. I would also like to re-emphasize that the meeting I attended was productive, enjoyable, and full of interesting, high quality people, especially the two outstanding young talents who organized it. This was my first conference (such as it was) and I want to attend the next one, but I doubt it will take place unless AR sues Sheraton &amp; the city of Charlotte, or finds a private meeting hall owned by sympathizers or AR itself.</p>

		<p>I commend especially message #34 and juxtapose it to #29 Instead<br>
of assurances ( if sincere from a brilliant and honorable source) that times have never been as ripe for success, it is<br>
very far past time to look into the minds and feelings of those<br>
who turn away from the message or are indifferent to it.  The<br>
notion that the Truth will prevail just by being dished up, has<br>
to be taken back to the drawing board ASAP.  The original assumptions have not been vindicated and big miscalulations have<br>
been made.  The impediments to the truth appear much much more formidible than we&rsquo;ve supposed.  Even if a lot of sophitication about what #34 touches upon is perverted into tee vee advertising, etc., some of the knowledge can be used to mitigate or remove impediments and to usher the facts into reach  &mdash;  not to inject them or insinuate them into people  &mdash;  just to get them in reach.  </p>

<p>As for the pathetic spectacle of Hotels&rsquo; &#8220;heading for the high grass&#8221;, I must say that I think some of us have been a little naive. Conservatives must come to the sad but true realization that Big Corporations, like Marriot, Sheraton, etc. are no friends of ours, and haven&rsquo;t been for a while.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, probably half the workers at any given hotel chain you visit are going to be illegal aliens! Hotels&rsquo; profits are based on finding large numbers of workers at the minimum wage. We should expect little sympathy from such enterprises.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s not quite right. The workers at Hotel chains in areas that are demographically Native Born White American are largely Native Born White American. I have seen this over and over again across America. I raise this point because it really exposes the lies of the immgration enhusiasts about the great need for importing foreign labor. Facts like these will never show up in the econometricians equations(which according to labor economist George Borjas are mathematically meaningless and worthless to begin with&hellip;.he stated this in the Journal of Economic Perpectives).</p>
<p>For examples of this, just check out the  Hotels in Hagerstown MD, the Hotel chains all along the Shennandoah Valley and Janesville Wisconsin. It&rsquo;s all a great big lie.</p>

		<p>Eh&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know, gents.  Speakers&hellip; and undoubtedly the vast majority of the potential attendees were a bit, how to put this delicately&hellip; GERIATRIC, weren&rsquo;t they?  You seriously mean to tell me they couldn&rsquo;t find anyone in the&hellip; ahem.. &#8220;under-50 crowd&#8221; to present?</p>
<p>Also, as the cliche goes, &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&#8221;  Seems if I had shelled out the funds from my own hard-earned pay for transportation, lodging and cost of conference to attend this thing last year, and it got cancelled, and then in the aftermath, AmRen did exactly&hellip; WHAT?  What did AmRen do in response to the cancellation of LAST year&rsquo;s conference? I hear only the empty winds of the Antarctic pole as an answer. Wait! I think there WERE a couple of self-righteous, overly-pedantic, &#8220;articles&#8221; on the &#8220;injustice&#8221; of it all, but way down deep where the money&rsquo;s at, what REALLY was done about it?  What lawsuits were filed?  What protests or sign-waves or campaigns OF ANY KIND were organized as a result of LAST year&rsquo;s &hellip;ahem&hellip; &#8220;cancellation?&#8221; </p>
<p>Pay close attention to Poster #47!  </p>
<p>You have people who threw down their own hard-earned money on INTERNATIONAL flights to attend THIS year&rsquo;s conference, and lo and behold!  Lookie here!  Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! As Gomer Pyle used to chortle.  Look what happened again this year!!!  And again, here we are reading about &hellip;ahem&hellip; &#8220;A Very Successful Unsuccessful Conference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah right&hellip; </p>
<p>And again, way down deep where the money&rsquo;s at&hellip; stop me if you see a pattern emerging, please&hellip; what do ANY of you think is REALLY gonna happen as a result of THIS year&rsquo;s &hellip;ahem&hellip; &#8220;cancellation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Think anybody&rsquo;s gonna REALLY file any lawsuits of this?  Did they last year?  With the admittedly admirable exception of jewamongyou and his group&hellip;all five of them it looks like&hellip; where were&hellip;excuse me, ARE &hellip; the counter-protests?  The sign-waves, the media appearances?  Again, let&rsquo;s listen to the despairing sound of the empty winds whistling across the Antarctic wastes.</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t YOU there with jewamongyou and his group?  Why wasn&rsquo;t I?<br>
   <br>
Organize locally.  All politics is local as a much wiser man than myself once said, and yep, way down deep where the money&rsquo;s at, ALL politics is LOCAL.  This online &#8220;National&#8221; keyboard commando stuff leading to &#8220;suit-and-tie/wine-and-cheese,&#8221; yearly academic &#8220;conferences&#8221; just ain&rsquo;t working, gents. </p>
<p>Only posters #12, #17 and #23 seem to have ANY remote clue of the tactics to take from this point onward.  Hats off again to jewamongyou and his group!  You guys have the heart, the soul, the grit, the courage, the determination, and the belief to show the way the rest of us are going to HAVE TO take if we want to see ANY improvement at all.</p>

		<p>FROM AN OCEAN AWAY: I attended the shadow conference &amp; jewamongyou&rsquo;s demonstration (the last 10 minutes anyway - I woke up late!) You make some good points&hellip;BUT, while the speakers may not have been spring chickens, the shadow conference could more accurately be called, THE YOUNG GUNS CONFERENCE. At 59, I was the oldest person there by a decade. (Paul Fromm arrived later.) A large majority of the 20+ people there during the day WERE IN THEIR 20&rsquo;s &amp; 30&rsquo;s, with twentysomethings being the largest single age-group. I was delighted to see this. There IS a youth wing to our movement and after spending the day with them, I can assure you they&rsquo;re an impressive bunch - smart, tech savvy, determined, &amp; full of youthful energy.</p>
<p>Yes, AmRen IS in crisis. I agree that Jared &amp; company need to step it up a notch (OK, maybe 200 notches), but, as a traditionalist, I think the conferences are extremely important. We should raise money, hire pit-bull lawyers, and go after Cannon, Charlotte, and Sheraton until we get our rights restored.</p>

<p>&#8220;On Sunday, we hit the streets and picketed the airport Sheraton - which had cancelled. Passers-by gave us thumbs up and it was a lot of fun. Images and videos to come!&#8221;</p>
<p>And check out his blog that he links,</p>
<p><a href="http://jewamongyou.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jewamongyou.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>where there are photos now of the picketing by himself and others.</p>
<p>On his blog, jewamongyou writes of the picketing:</p>
<p>&#8220;For all the intelligent and insightful words we exchange on the internet, the actual goal is action on the street.  If our movement remains strictly a virtual one, it will be irrelevant.  So we feel that our street protest is the culmination of our efforts – and only the first of many others like it.  Hopefully, the sight of us standing publicly for all to see, and proud of what we stand for, will serve as an inspiration for others to do likewise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poster 54  &mdash;  From An Ocean Away, you clicked a switch in my head, and I hope the same will happen with others who read your post. </p>
<p>THAT SMALL DEMONSTRATION OUT ON THE STREET AFTER THE CANCELLATION MAY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE, IN ITS IMPACT ON THE DRIVERS WHO WERE PROBABLY AMAZED TO SEE IT, THAN ALL THE DVDs, ETC. FROM THE CONFERENCE WILL ACCOMPLISH!</p>
<p>We must force the issue of the right of whites to speak and be heard, so I urge Amren to include as part of the program for its next conference, a MARCH, optional of course, down a principal street after the conference, with proper permits obtained from the city and so forth. </p>
<p>(In fact, come to think of it, eventually the Amren speeches should be delivered on an outdoor public stage, like the commies have always done&hellip;.we can&rsquo;t just keep talking to ourselves forever).</p>
<p>In the months preceding the conference, the MARCH should be publicized as one of the main features of the event, and enthusiasm should be drummed up among all interested to come and MARCH. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to MARCH (I am SO ready! SO frustrated!) But I&rsquo;m not a brave person, and I&rsquo;m not going to march down the street with 5 other people. But if there are 50 of us minimum, I&rsquo;m in. And I urge all the other retired old coots like myself to be in too. (I was a lefty rad back in the 60s, and I assure you it&rsquo;s easy&hellip;just put one foot in front of the other and have a willingness to feel like a fool chanting simple refrains over and over).</p>
<p>So those of you (jewamongyou?) who have the spunk and energy to put something like this together, get to work on selecting the city and getting those permits now, please.</p>
<p>And many thanks to you who demonstrated after this cancellation. </p>
