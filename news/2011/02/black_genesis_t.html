	<p>Robert Bauval (Author) and Thomas Brophy Ph.D. (Author)</p>
<p><b>Product Description</b></p>
<p>Presents proof that an advanced black African civilization inhabited the Sahara long before Pharaonic Egypt</p>
<p>* Reveals black Africa to be at the genesis of ancient civilization and the human story</p>
<p>* Examines extensive studies into the lost civilization of the &#8220;Star People&#8221; by renowned anthropologists, archaeologists, genetic scientists, and cultural historians as well as the authors&rsquo; archaeoastronomy and hieroglyphics research</p>
<p>* Deciphers the history behind the mysterious Nabta Playa ceremonial area and its stone calendar circle and megaliths</p>
<p>Relegated to the realm of archaeological heresy, despite a wealth of hard scientific evidence, the theory that an advanced civilization of black Africans settled in the Sahara long before Pharaonic Egypt existed has been dismissed and even condemned by conventional Egyptologists, archaeologists, and the Egyptian government. Uncovering compelling new evidence, Egyptologist Robert Bauval and astrophysicist Thomas Brophy present the anthropological, climatological, archaeological, geological, and genetic research supporting this hugely debated theory of the black African origin of Egyptian civilization.</p>
<p>Building upon extensive studies from the past four decades and their own archaeoastronomical and hieroglyphic research, the authors show how the early black culture known as the Cattle People not only domesticated cattle but also had a sophisticated grasp of astronomy; created plentiful rock art at Gilf Kebir and Gebel Uwainat; had trade routes to the Mediterranean coast, central Africa, and the Sinai; held spiritual and occult ceremonies; and constructed a stone calendar circle and megaliths at the ceremonial site of Nabta Playa reminiscent of Stonehenge, yet much older. Revealing these &#8220;Star People&#8221; as the true founders of ancient Egyptian civilization, this book completely rewrites the history of world civilization, placing black Africa back in its rightful place at the center of mankind&rsquo;s origins.</p>
<p><b>About the Author</b></p>

		<p>not only is this pure unadulterated garbage, it is recycled garbage.</p>
<p>this is a replay of the &#8220;Black Athena&#8221; so called controversy of the 90s, when it was claimed that Greek civilization was all stolen from the supposedly black Egyptians.</p>
<p>all totally and completely debunked in the 90s: <br>
see Not Out of Africa by Mary Lefkowitz, and also her History Lesson: A Race Odyssey, for an interesting account of how a serious and renowned scholar can be persecuted &amp; harassed, dragged into court by a bunch of incredibly stupid &amp; privileged racist black academics.</p>
<p>the terrifying thing is that most blacks believe all of this nonsense - they&rsquo;re still poring over Malcolm X&rsquo;s unintentionally hilarious, idiotic and infantile speeches, taking every word literally&hellip;.</p>

		<p>More interesting is recent DNA studies show EuroAsians are a hybrid from mating between Homo Neanderthal and Homo Sapiens.  That Neanderthal/Sapiens hybrid shares DNA in a region previously associated with cognitive skills among EuroAsians and other traits related to IQ.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the Neanderthals who never pushed south beyond the Gaza Strip interbred with Sapiens to produce a robust, intelligent hybrid.  That hybrid left their more primitive Homo Sapiens cousins behind in Sub Saharan Africa and joined their Homo Neanderthal cousins in Europe, Asia.</p>

		<p>I have not read the book, but I do have some knowledge of Egyptian genetics. Those genetics reveal, as one might expect, that the Egyptians derive most of their ancestry from the ancient basic stock of north and north-east Africa, the arc of country from Ethiopia in the south-east to Morocco in the north-west. That basic stock has at various, mostly ancient, times been significantly supplemented from the near east, southern Europe and the middle Nile(Nubia)with the Nubian cline increasing steadily the further upriver one goes in Egypt.</p>
<p>The Egyptian type, therefore, is as it has always been, substantially caucasoid (although not white). Egyptian civilization was evolved on the spot by those caucasoids, and repeated attempts to show that it came from elsewhere (Atlantis, Mesopotamia)have always come to naught, and so will this latest version - but not before it has blazed a gaudy trail through the media and the schools.</p>

Here is a video of the author discussing his book along with views of the archaeological sites:</p>
<p><a href="http://robertbauval.co.uk/books.html" rel="nofollow">http://robertbauval.co.uk/books.html</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what kind of hard evidence he has but from the video, he seems to make large leaps.</p>
<p>While I understand that climate has changed over thousands of years, it seems odd that an advanced civilization would spring up in an arid environment. Civilizations need water. Deserts have very little.<br>

		<p> And on the seventh day They rested!</p>
<p> Amazon, which has always ranked high in my personal estimation, appears to have made a grievous error by agreeing to sell this joke of a book, if it proves to be anything like the pre-publication ballyhoo paints it. We are supposed to believe that black Africans created all these wonderful things, centuries before anyone else, and yet somehow, they have in the thousands of years since sunk into abysmal ignorance, poverty and Low-IQville.</p>
<p> If all these wonderful things were achieved by the blacks, lo these many centuries ago, then why were they not discovered by archaeologists, long before now? Deliberately suppressed due to &#8220;White racism,&#8221; no doubt.</p>
<p> It will be interesting to see how reviewers rank this tome, once it is actually foisted on the reading public. I&rsquo;d guess two stars, at best. </p>

		<p>Read &#8220;The Mars Mystery&#8221; first! Bauval co-wrote it with Graham Hancock. Here is a review:</p>
<p>&#8221; Are certain formations on the Martian surface the remnants of an ancient civilization  &mdash;  one strikingly similar to ancient Egypt  &mdash;  that was destroyed by a cataclysmic deep impact?<br>
Hancock&rsquo;s ultimate point is that we should be paying more attention to our planetary neighbours and the skies above, lest we suffer the same fate as the Martians. Hancock raises many intriguing questions in this synthesis of unorthodox Mars theory &hellip; &#8220;</p>

		<p>Well let me say this, I am not surprised. I am so thankful that we have blacks to think, invent and do for us poor pathetic white devils.</p>
<p>Without black we would still be in the stone age. But because of black genius we live in a world unlike any that has ever existed before (Other than the beautiful civilizations built by blacks so many years ago) Thank You is what I want to say to all blacks during this Most Special of Months, have a happy and merry black history month unless you are too busy improving the lives of others?</p>

		<p>Black Logic:  Egypt is in Africa.  Black people came from Africa.  So ancient Egyptians must have been black.</p>
<p>Of course they fail to do any research such as why ancient Egyptians would call the people to the south of Upper Egypt the Nubians or dark skinned people.  (Note:  Southern Egypt was called Upper Egypt because the Nile flows from south to north)</p>
<p>And as one who has been to Egypt, the drawings and hieroglyphs look nothing like black Africans.  To me, they actually looked sort of Asain.</p>

		<p>Both &ldquo;scientists&rdquo; appear White as in &ldquo;trucker whites&rdquo; on their websites which are full of new age type pseudo science, as they are selling trips to Egypt and other such things.<br>
However, these guys got it all wrong.<br>
EVERYONE knows that black civilization stated in Iceland in 20,000 BC.<br>
Blacks discovered China and were responsible for the civilization there, teaching the Chinese how to open restaurants and laundries.<br>
The same, when they discovered America and were responsible for the Aztec civilization, teaching the Mexicans, how to mow grass, pick up trash and bus tables.<br>
Their greatest contribution was civilizing White People, teaching them how to build cathedrals, compose classical music, compose epic literature and create the greatest philosophies. <br>
Alas, all this black civilization came to an end, when at its apogee under Emperor Elijah Muhammad IXX, Viking cannibals discovered Iceland and ate all the peaceful black people.<br>
&hellip;and if you take my satire seriously or the fairy tale, Black Genesis: The Prehistoric Origins of Ancient Egypt, then rest assured, Peter Pan will indeed come to your bed in the night and take you to Never Never Land, the place where all Marxist/liberals and &#8220;responsible&#8221; conservative all belong.</p>

<p>We know from black history month that black Africans reached the moon several thousand years before the white man. We also know that the black Africans fondness for water made them navigate the seas and discover America thousands of years before any other group even knew about fluid displacement and boats. And we know that the entire encyclopedia of astronomical discovery was written by black Africans, so why do people doubt that they also created civilization.</p>

		<p>Of course blacks are the bastion and creators of civilization, can&rsquo;t you tell from what they have accomplished since then?  All sarcasm aside though, I doubt the credits of these people even though I do not have a phd.  It is probably a few dubious facts that could go either and a few thousand facts that discredits them that they forgot to mention.  Its not lying to them, its selective reporting.  Funny how no one thought this before the 70s when they sociologists and gov&rsquo;t decided to rewrite history to help blacks feel better about thei civilization.  But think about this, could people really have built pyramids before discovering the wheel?  did they drags all those multi-ton building blocks through the sand then?  Common sense trumps wacky leftist theory once again.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind reading this book for a laugh, but could not bring myself to knowing contribute to this fool financially.</p>

		<p>These shenanigans are EXCELLENT teaching moments for your young child or your soon-to-be awakened White friend.</p>
<p>It points out the obvious distortions and reveals the underlying motivation: prop up the pathetic &#8220;history&#8221; of sub-Saharan Africans and erase the multitudinous achievements of WHITE men throughout history.</p>
<p>The best place to start is physical evidence: show them the paintings that clearly show White Egyptians slave-driving Semites/Arabs and Bantus/Blacks.  Also take note of the Pharoah&rsquo;s sandals with pictures of Blacks/Arabs on the soles, and the Pharoah&rsquo;s scepter with Blacks/Arabs, so that the proud White man can hold his foreign subjects in his hand and tread over them as he paces about.</p>
<p>The only Black/Arab admixture you find is towards the LATER AND LAST dynasties, when Egypt was in DECLINE.</p>
<p>So, the next point you make is &#8220;browning out&#8221;  &mdash;   a concept all White men should know about.  Egypt browned out, look at it now.  India did the same thing, as did Persia, Greek, and Portugal.  Teaching moments!!!</p>

		<p>Nabta Playa is a large bowllike enclosure on a high plain about 60 miles west of the Nile valley.  It is supposedly the site of some considerable rainfall during one of the interglacial periods between 70,000 and 130,000 years BC and has been intermittently wet ever since.</p>
<p>If there were people there at the time, it would make sense that they were &#8216;sub Saharan&rsquo; (a desert then much smaller) Africans because this was just about 20,000 years short of when we made the leap across the Red Sea into present day Saudi Arabia from Ras Gheanni and Ras Hurghada to somewhere near Sharm Al Sheikh on our way to perhaps India and from there, further north into Asia and, eventually, Europe (this is the route that mitochondrial DNA suggests based on cumulative mutations as age markers between populations).</p>
<p>This later point, some 50-60,000 years ago marks the delineation between the L1/2/3 gene groups with ONLY THE LATTER making the jump towards the modern M and N (European and East Asian) geneline inheritances.</p>
<p>And only in a tiny group of perhaps as few as 250-500 individuals.</p>
<p>i.e.  Genetically speaking, we all have to start somewhere.  But our base is older than Egypts civilization by tens of milliennia and far more evolutionarily selective as indeed &#8216;royally lucky&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What Mr. Brophy does to discredit himself is use star dates for the Stone Megalith &#8216;calendar&rsquo; at Nabta Playa to align with Orion&rsquo;s belt at a period some 16-17,000 years ago.  Still after our genetic split but older than most accepted norms of socialized culture by almost 5 millennia.</p>
<p>This brings up several problems of course, namely that there is no dateable archaelogical association to prove such an astronomic archaism.  And the climate had drastically changed again, in the interim.  Forcing the so called settlements to become seasonally inhabited during wet seasons when the associated lake was full.</p>
<p>It is the sophisticate (above and underground) nature and regularized (streets) layout of these settlements indicating a planned nature, as well as the fact that that there are (also undated, last I heard) some fairly significant ritual sacrifice themes going on that serves to differentiate these people as being &#8216;more culturally sophisticated&rsquo; than nearby Nile Valley dwellers.  Who tended to spread out into sprawling micro-cultures because the river let them.</p>
<p>If you take the nominal radio carbon dating evidence with later stellar calendar alignments up to a more realistic 4,800-6,200BC period, some of the &#8216;black cultural genesis&rsquo; roots may in fact be true, as a function of an Egyptian precursor cultures.</p>
<p>What I am less convinced of is the genetics supporting the notion that these people and the later, lower, Egyptian cultures had any contact at all as the &#8216;Cattle Cult&rsquo; of the neolithic pre-Kerma peoples is supported only by ill defined stone relief carvings and a few skeletons whose black features are NOT backed by residual genetic linkage to pre-Kush Egyptian mummies.</p>
<p>Nabta Playa itself shows signs of much intercultural trade between Western Desert Oases&rsquo; cultures, Upper Nile and Nubian proto societies however.</p>
<p>i.e.  Which way did the civilization building meme&rsquo;s flow&hellip;  No one will likely ever really know.</p>
<p>Since there is no evidence of things like the subterranean and organized community stone work migrating North, down the Nile Valley, I have to question a deep-Africa source point for later Egyptian cultures.</p>
<p>I am also not particularly enthused by the near religious tone adopted in elevating early Egypt&rsquo;s so-called &#8216;sophistication&rsquo;.  As, even if purely a Levant people, to use pyramid building (the most structurally useless piece of architecture ever created, wasteful of lives and time) as a mark of greatness shows less an appreciation for culture than totalitarianist obsession.</p>
<p>The fact remains however, that with the Nile and -only- the Nile to direct cultural as geneflow, between 4400 and 1,300BC, was a time of great cultural shifts as both sides pushed back and forth and around 1,750BC, the Kerma did indeed come very close to annihilating Egypt.  Only perhaps their nomadic roots preventing them from staying long enough to accomplish this.  200 years later the situation was reversed with Thutmoses virtually annexing all of Northern Nubia.</p>
<p>Of note, even when Nubians went North as Pharaohs, they were quickly Egyptianized, to the point of forbidding other Nubians (traders etc.) from following them past the Fourth Cataract.  They knew who had the good life.</p>
<p>As a result of selective mergence and rule, the heretofore linguistically and architecturally distinct Nubian and Egyptian cultures eventually merged and became largely undifferentiateable.</p>
<p>Which would mean that Eastern Blacks are a part of the Egyptian legacy (of note, Nubia disappeared yet Kush outlasted Egypt and neither has anything to do with Bantu peoples of Western Africa&hellip;).</p>
<p>None of which matters to us.  Because what would become European culture had -long since- left the region.  And would indeed only stage a temporary return, after the Semitic Assyrians through back the Kushite kingdom&rsquo;s short rule over Egypt.  Alexander took the Assyrians and Ptolemaic rule over Egypt made them the 32nd and last royal dynasty, entirely Greek from first to last, for about 275 years.</p>
<p>Not a bad run.</p>
<p>Albeit in tiny numbers, The Greeks are still there, to this day.  But Egypt is more Arabic than it ever was Black and that is perhaps the lesson that most needs emphasizing: To sustain your culture is to sustain your genes.  Lose the one to accommodation and overrun and you forever lose the eminence of the other as mixing leads to diminishment of identity as meme, not hybrid excellence of both.</p>

However, these guys got it all wrong.<br>
EVERYONE knows that black civilization stated in Iceland in 20,000 BC.<br>
Blacks discovered China and were responsible for the civilization there, teaching the Chinese how to open restaurants and laundries.<br>
The same, when they discovered America and were responsible for the Aztec civilization, teaching the Mexicans, how to mow grass, pick up trash and bus tables.<br>
Their greatest contribution was civilizing White People, teaching them how to build cathedrals, compose classical music, compose epic literature and create the greatest philosophies. <br>
Alas, all this black civilization came to an end, when at its apogee under Emperor Elijah Muhammad IXX, Viking cannibals discovered Iceland and ate all the peaceful black people.<br>

Black Genesis seems like a good read.</p>
<p>But its more than obvious that should any people believe such an idea as blacks being at the genesis of civilization, that race will be doomed to repeat the ancient errors described in holy books around the world.</p>
<p>If a civilizaed group of blacks truly existed back in the times described in the book,then they most likely coexisted with other races in a system laws governed by whites.</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt did have West African sculpturs who did form a knowledgable tribe called the Dogon.<br>
But even the Dogon based their knowledge on Egyptian studies. <br>

		<p>Blacks lived in what is now Egypt before whites, because the Caucasian race evolved on the other side of the Sinai Peninsula. However, there is no evidence of a black civilization earlier than the civilization of the Pharaohs. From mummies and paintings we know that nearly all of the inhabitants of ancient Egypt were Caucasians. What seems to have happened is that after developing agriculture on the other side of Sinai white farmers crossed back over, and displaced the blacks. After that happened, the Sahara Desert kept the races separate.  <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, Egyptian civilization did extend south to Nubia. About two and a half thousand years ago agriculture and iron age technology began to spread from Nubia to the rest of Africa.  </p>

		<p>If any of these Afrocentric theories were even marginally believable, white liberals would be shouting them from the rooftops.  In their zeal to destroy Western civilization, they would love the idea of crediting black Africans with every move forward in human history.  Instead, white leftists are silent on the matter, not even condemning the most preposterous assertions that have come along (black Egyptians could fly, etc.)  Thus, Afrocentrism remains on the lunatic fringe of ideas, consigning it to black-study courses and volumes marketed by black separatists.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve picked up that Ireland has been running its own version of this via their television documentaries, but it was reshaped, apparently at Trinity College to fit into Ireland&rsquo;s prehistory.  The mystery of the origin and disappearance of the Tuatha de Dannan when the Celts arrived has long been speculated upon, with ideas like The Lost Tribe of Israel and others.  Today, the idea is being pervaded that they were in fact black Africans.  This idea has been taken up by the increasing numbers of Africans in Ireland and shouted from treetops (get it?) at the Irish youth who are simultaneously being told by their government to emigrate if they want jobs.</p>
<p>An educational institution used to be a place where the student learned how to think critically, sequestered from politics and social agenda.  But it was always a more or less situation with Christian schools for example, teaching with their particular bias.  This gave permission to Marxists and radicals of all types to invade and usurp the teaching and learning process until now, when there is practically no place on earth where one could go to learn without some sort of social/political bias/brainwashing accompanying the process. </p>

		<p>Back in the mid 1970s through the 1980s whites(and others) in the Army were subjected to an endless series of &#8220;race relation classes&#8221; given by black NCOs that were packed with this kind of nonsense.  Huge posters were displayed that indicated that in Africa, thousands of years ago, blacks had advanced far beyond any race on planet earth.  They (blacks) flew from large city to city years before Christ was born, they had tall buildings that equaled the Empire State Building, and their culture was so far advanced we in this present age have not yet achieved it.  However, when questioned, mostly by southern born NCOs &amp; officers, what happened to this great race, silence or being called a &#8220;racist&#8221;, was the response from these so-called trainers.  I remember in 1976 a white First Sergeant had heard enough and during one of these classes exploded with the facts concerning the black rate of crime, vd, and other misdeeds within his unit.  The response of the staff at 8th Army, Korea, was to fire him, send him back to the states to retire and increase our &#8220;race relations&#8221; classes.  This book is a &#8220;rehash&#8221; of the nonsense taught to us in the 1970s/1980s by NCOs with a GED &amp; IQ of 80.  Nothing new here.  In passing the black NCOs that taught these classes in Korea were involved with a lot of crimes against the Koreans off-post.  Check out the race riots in 1971 at Camp Humpreys and ASCOM City, Korea by black &#8220;soldiers&#8221;.    </p>

<p><i>Not Out of Africa by Mary Lefkowitz, and also her <i>History Lesson: A Race Odyssey</i>, for an interesting account of how a serious and renowned scholar can be persecuted &amp; harassed, dragged into court by a bunch of incredibly stupid &amp; privileged racist black academics.</i></p>
<p>Thank you for bringing up Mary Lefkowitz, one of the bravest souls imaginable, her story is indeed very interesting.  She took it upon herself to challenge the Afrocentric view of history being taught at Wellesley and paid a very heavy price for doing so.  I would love to see her ordeal made into a movie.</p>
<p><i>Mary Lefkowitz challenged the historical accuracy of Martin Bernal&rsquo;s Black Athena (which argued that ancient Greek culture had African &mdash; especially Egyptian &mdash; roots) and other Afrocentric works that claimed western civilization had basically been stolen from Africa.</i> </p>
<p>She fought the good fight both professionally and personally against the shoddy scholarship of black Afro-centrists in the midst of the culture wars of the 90s    &mdash;   dragged into court, ostracized by her colleagues, branded a racist in print and told her views were &#8220;opinion&#8221; or outright &#8220;lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very few came to her defense during this time, including the administrators at the university she worked for, Wellesley:</p>
<p><i>When Lefkowitz got the summons for Martin&rsquo;s lawsuit, Dean of the College Nancy Kolodny told her, &#8216;It&rsquo;s your problem. The college can&rsquo;t help you.&rsquo;  Were they  they afraid of what being tarred as &#8216;racists&rsquo; would do to their careers?</i></p>
<p>Judge Bork writes in <i>Slouching Towards Gomorrah:</i></p>
<p><i>Mary Lefkowitz stood up during the question period and asked why the Afrocentrist lecturer made the claim that Aristotle stole his philosophy form the library at Alexandria when the library had been built after Aristotle&rsquo;s death?   His answer was that he resented the tone of the question and several students accused Lefkowitz of racism.  Her colleagues, who knew the lecturer was wrong, remained silent.</i></p>
<p><i>Later, Lefkowitz went to the dean of the college stating there was no evidence for what the Afrocentrists were teaching Wellesley&rsquo;s students. The dean replied that each person has a different but equally valid view of history.</i></p>
<p>Good luck to anyone contesting, he would do well to familiarize himself with the outright abuse Mary Lefkowitz was forced to endure before he began (what may prove to be) a futile effort.</p>

		<p>We in mandela&rsquo;s new south africa know that the black languages had no numerals or did they have the words &#8220;love&#8221; or &#8220;compassion&#8221;. The question is, how the hell did these wonderful black genius&rsquo; count? If they had no numerals, they had no maths.</p>

		<p>Africans were zooming to Pluto and back before evil whitey stole their Intergalactic Teletransporters.  Whites even stole the memory of how they were built from every black&rsquo;s head so they&rsquo;d never know how to build another one, nor that they invented them in the first place.</p>
<p>How could the authors leave out this vital piece of information?</p>

		<p>Ten years ago i did subscribe to diverse e-lists due to my interest in all things egyptian. One of these list (Maat_Tahuti) showed up to be a list for solely blacks, which also kept a tight censorship or policy of banishing members with deviating opinions. To my surprise there was quite many scholars present, actual egyptologists, but they were all there for getting high on pride - of being black. They used egyptology for this mean, and the degree of abuse of the subject was shocking. They did of course gather around the lie exposed by this book, and kept on with their unproved exposure of all egyptian statues being painted and sculpted more white than it should be. And the level of racism they exerted was higher than i would expect whites had 200 years ago. </p>
<p>But they point is; There is a lot of these obsessed scholars and they will not go away, because of hints. They have invested lots of pride in this and also effort they probably thisk is honest work.<br>
History will be rewritten by those in power, and that means in this present democrazy, the people. The situation will be &#8220;You can read your history book and i will read mine. And so what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless, the society itself understands that it must start to do something effectively to stop such false fabrications.</p>
<p>There is a David Duke essay somewhere which explains the egyptian civilisations fall due to the failure of the elite to reproduce themselves, and the black taking over. The period 1000bc-300 bc is marked by black pharaohs. Just that essay is so revealing that it explains the hate towards DD.<br>

		<p>Afrocentrists ought to be the most content with the one certainty they can prove: that Egypt was and is in Africa. Whoever predominated there at any given time, we know that the Nile Valley was both Africa&rsquo;s conduit into the greater world and the greater world&rsquo;s conduit into Africa.</p>
<p>That should be enough to stand on knowing the civilization of the Nile&rsquo;s importance in world history. Or am I missing something?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you people know that white people were created by the evil black scientist Yakub 6600 years ago? Before that point blacks were unrivaled geniuses and scientists, had unlocked all the knowledge in the universe, and a third became bored with their current perfect condition, so some like Yakub decided to create a new race.</p>
<p>Blacks are not only less intelligent than everyone else, they are downright delusional. Can a people who actually buy such nonsense ever be on equivalent footing in a society with other peoples who are rational and focused on truth and logic?</p>
