<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7416070.html">Doctor&rsquo;s Orders: Go to Mexico</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Harvey Rice, Houston Chronicle, February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The crushing news came last month as Maria Sanchez was being prepared for surgery to remove a banana-size tumor along her spine that had crept between her vertebrae.</p>
<p>Unable to use her right hand because of the growing tumor, Sanchez, 24, had been at the University of Texas Medical Branch&rsquo;s John Sealy Hospital for six days when, she said, a Spanish-speaking doctor told her she had to leave the hospital immediately because she was an illegal immigrant. The doctor said she should have surgery in Mexico, according to Sanchez.</p>
<p>Sanchez&rsquo;s hospital records state that she was discharged because she was &#8220;an undocumented pt (patient) with no insurance.&#8221; Records show that Sanchez underwent at least one medical procedure and surgery was scheduled before she was dismissed without warning Jan. 12.</p>
<p>After being discharged, Sanchez called her husband, Luis Aguillon, a legal U.S. resident, who arrived at the hospital to find his wife and his mother sitting on her bed crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;They treated us like animals, like dogs or something,&#8221; said Aguillon, 36, an unemployed welder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Losing use of limbs</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are going to be brutally honest, this is a practice that takes place at other hospitals,&#8221; Nealon [Bill Nealon, a former UTMB general surgeon now at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn.] said. &#8220;The real problem for UTMB is that it was documented, and they have a commitment for care to the indigent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>No law either prohibits or requires hospitals to accept illegal immigrants as patients outside the emergency room, experts said. In cases where a patient&rsquo;s immigration status is an issue, it&rsquo;s generally in the context of the patient&rsquo;s inability to pay, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Told to go to Mexico</b></p>
<p>Aguillon said his wife&rsquo;s ability to pay was never mentioned and he was handed an application for charity care on his way out after his wife was refused care.</p>
<p>Under a heading for follow-up appointments, Sanchez&rsquo;s discharge order states, &#8220;With PCP (primary care physician) in one week, NS (neurosurgery) as scheduled in Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aguillon said he was upset about being told to take his wife to Mexico, a country he left when he was 13. &#8220;It&rsquo;s like saying to that black lady, because she is black, go to Africa,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State law requires hospitals to have a charity policy prominently posted in waiting rooms, but Lenihan [Dr. Merle Lenihan, author of a 2009 report on hospital charity care policies in Galveston County] says UTMB&rsquo;s policy is so vague that there is no way to know how decisions to deny charity care are being made. She said it was especially troubling that the public has no way to know how a taxpayer-funded institution decides how it uses tax money designated for charity care.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Accepted as patient</b></p>
<p>Medical records show that Sanchez was admitted to the emergency room at Clear Lake Regional Medical Center on Jan. 5. The next day she was transferred to UTMB because Clear Lake doctors lacked the neurosurgical skills needed to treat her, the records state.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Aguillon eventually took his wife to at least five hospitals and three clinics. Aguillon finally moved from Galveston to Houston so he could qualify for care at Ben Taub General Hospital, where she is being treated.<br>

		<p>The arrogance and the entitlement attitude of these illegal aliens are disgusting. They act like they have a right to medical care courtesy of the American taxpayer. Until our politicians develop a moral backbone, I fear that illegal aliens like Maria Sanchez will continue to take advantage of our medical system and cry racism and xenophobia when we don&rsquo;t cater to their every demand.</p>

		<p>This situation is outrageous and caused by the mexican government and the mexican people.  How dare they abuse our system to the point where good people have to make brutal decisions like this to avoid the collapse of their healthcare system.  I notice not one iota of blame is pointed at the party most at fault&hellip;.mexico.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, the US should handle this using economic force.  We trade with mexico.  Extremely high tariffs should be waged on mexican goods, especially oil.  That income should be used to pay for what it costs the United States to deal with mexicans and it should be at a premium.  Each mexican, both legal and illegal, that comes to the US should cost mexico much more than it would cost for them to do the right thing and take care of their own.</p>
<p>In other words, treat this woman&rsquo;s cancer, then send her and her illegal family home.  Use force to take the amount it costs from mexico.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;black lady&#8221; has probably never even BEEN to Africa.  And she probably didn&rsquo;t sneak across our border like a thief in the night.  So that&rsquo;s a stupid argument.  But playing the race card usually works, so of course he&rsquo;s going to try it.</p>
<p>This article shows, once again, the selfishness and sense of entitlement that illegals have.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to occur to them, and/or they don&rsquo;t care, that someone else has to pay for their &#8220;free&#8221; medical procedures. </p>

<p>No, it is like saying to a Mexican lady, because she is Mexican, go to Mexico.</p>
<p>Americans would never get such treatment in Mexico at the expense of the Mexican taxpayer. Does that make Mexico a racist and bigoted State?</p>

<p>When one considers the Aguillon&rsquo;s are unemployed and lack medical coverage in the US and that his wife would be fully covered by Mexico&rsquo;s national health system the doctor&rsquo;s suggestion makes a lot of sense. My recommendation is for the Aguillon&rsquo;s to make that 45 minute drive to a hospital across the border where her treatment will be fully covered by her fellow citizens. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too bad the witless reporter at the Houston Chronicle decided to use this NON issue to score some cheap political points.</p>

		<p>His surname is Aguillon and hers is Sanchez and they are married. I can only presume that this is common for Mexicans to keep their own name. It seems unlikely, but what do I know about third world culture. </p>
<p>Luis likens his wifes(?) predicament to that of Africans brought here against their will. He said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like saying to that black lady, because she is black, go to Africa,&rdquo; .What does he not understand about someone jumping the border and being here illegally and someone brought here in chains, which was legal at that time. Why doesn&rsquo;t he have insurance to cover his families medical needs. Does he think just because he has been here 13 years that he in &#8220;entitled&#8221; to anything. <br>

		<p>&#8220;they have a commitment for care to the indigent.&#8221;  For whom?  The entire world?  And for those of you who don&rsquo;t know charity care is paid for by the taxpayers and is in no way charity of the traditional sort such a through a church or private charitable organization.  Charity care is another form of welfare.  These illegals are why our hospitals are going bankrupt.  </p>
<p>Our feckless government says we can not deport 20 million illegals.  I say we can if we refuse to provide them with freebies, as well as jobs and housing.  They will self-deport.<br>

		<p>They had this quadraplegic Mexican kid here in Chi that fell off a roof. The hospital spent over $700,000 to care for the kid and medical air transport back to Mex. NO nursing home would take him and he needs constant care. NOT the responsibility of the hospital.</p>
<p>NOT being treated as animals or dogs or garbage. Rather, treated with great courtesy and LEGALLY and medically as is needed. Nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>Actually, it would be like telling Barack Obama&rsquo;s illegal alien aunt to get out of our country and back to Africa where she belongs. Which I think is 100% okay.</p>

		<p>&#8221; her husband, Luis Aguillon, a legal U.S. resident&#8221; AND THIS &#8221; said Aguillon, 36, an unemployed welder&#8221;</p>
<p>Which of course, means he is on various welfare programs and therefore has the ability to move around since he doesn&rsquo;t have to work&hellip;wonder how long he has been unemployed. I have no compassion for these ILLEGAL ALIEN INVADERS and I think calling &#8220;Aguillon&#8221; a &#8220;legal resident&#8221; may be stretching the truth by the author.</p>

		<p>Google &#8216;Fred On Everything&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Fred is a US Citizen living in Mexico with his wife/girl friend (?). I don&rsquo;t know or care about their legal relationship.  He has posted two, possibly three, articles relating his personal experience with the Mexican National Health System.  He states that it is just as good as the care delivered in the USA, and that it is also cheaper.</p>
<p>Therefore, the husband in the above article protests too much.  His wife will be in good hands in Mexico.</p>

		<p>I am sorry for Miss Maria Sanchez and her maybe husband. But the plain truth is that Americans are starting to wake up and say NO, to being used and taken advantage of while being cussed at and kicking the people who pay for all the free education and medical care. So this is no surprise. Americans feel for people like this But, there comes a time in all of our lives that we have to pay the piper at some date.</p>

		<p>I disagree with everyone above.  Oh sure, if you sneak into a country and need medical treatment and can&rsquo;t pay for it, don&rsquo;t expect so much from the medical establishment of that country.  But the woman was being prepared for surgury.  For a major operation that radically improve the life of a 24-year-old wife, whose husband is legal resident.</p>
<p>  For the sake of the Hipprocratic oath, and because you as a doctor are extremely well paid, and because the medical facility (and the corporation behind it) is better compensated than any other medical facility in the history of the world for the care that they provide, then, yes, shut up and do what you are supposed to do, do the surgury.  Warmly, correctly, professionally.</p>
<p>  The fact that the patient was being prepared for surgury before they got around to the documentation and compensation matters shows that they (the medical facility) is incompetent, stupid, and corrupt.  The fact that they would take a patient off the operating table as a result of their incompetence shows that they are inhuman.</p>
<p>  There are consequences to being inhuman and incompetent.  One of them is that you pay the bill for a medical procedure that you argreed to do and actually have the patient on the table ready.</p>
<p>  I share everyone&rsquo;s opinions here on the immigration issues, but this situation is insane and a disgrace to our humanity as a country rich and a people.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have to read the article to know that the author did not even broach the subject of what happens to illegals without insurance when they want major surgery in Mexico.  The odds are 100-1 against it.</p>
<p>Thus I don&rsquo;t even have to read the article to know that the author is a partisan hack, not a journalist.  They don&rsquo;t give stories like these to journalists.</p>

		<p>This story is likely intended to instill sympathy for illegal aliens seeking free health care, but the fact is, illegal aliens seeking free health care are largely to blame for this.  If they didn&rsquo;t abuse the system, hospitals would not need to turn the occasional person away who legitimately had no other options.</p>

<p>If this was just about one or two cases, it might be an outrage to deny treatment, but everyone knows that it is epidemic for years, decades, and it is breaking the financial backs of Americans who DO pay taxes and pay for insurance policies that have to make up for all the free care for illegals and even legals who show up in emergency rooms for every malady in the book.</p>
<p>As far as your calling the hospital incompetent and stupid, why would you want anyone or yourself to get care at such a place.  Likely, they discovered along the way that she was illegal and then feared the very situation that it has caused.  This sort of thing just can&rsquo;t go on and on forever.</p>
<p>One solution might be for the U.S. to hand Mexico the bill for caring for their citizens.  But that ought only to be done after we cut off the 350 million USD that the corrupt and stupid Mexican government gets for pretending to fight the drug cartels.</p>

		<p>Simonetta - Our country is not rich&hellip; we&rsquo;re trillions in debt and a fair amount of that debt was incurred sending money to other countries for &#8220;development&#8221; and a runaway welfare state that spends no small amount of money on poor immigrants (legal, illegal, refugees).</p>
<p>Second, hospitals and doctors are not required to provide non-emergency care. What you&rsquo;re saying is that this woman has a legal right to demand goods and services from other people without compensation.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: she is writing checks on other people&rsquo;s labor without their consent.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story of a girl brought here illegally awaiting her fourth(!) liver transplant at our expense. Why shouldn&rsquo;t her home country provide this? As stated in the article, the first-year cost of a transplant is about half a million and the annual cost of medications is about $30K. And then there&rsquo;s the issue of providing rare transplant organs to illegals (meaning that citizens are denied since the demand for organs far exceeds supply).</p>

		<p>Dear  Simonetta (Post 14):  I challenge you to put your money where your mouth is (or are you just blowing hot air?).  Tomorrow morning, go to the nearest border hospital or inner-city hospital and tell the people in the Emergency Room that you will pay for the medical treatment of all the illegals who come in that day.  This is what you are asking of the Physicians, Nurses, and other hospital staff.</p>
<p>Please step up to the plate and do your &#8220;duty&#8221; as a human being (which is, according to you, to provide free health care to the people of Mexico).  Please report back to this web-site as to the name of the hospital, the number of illegal aliens you helped, and the amount of money you contributed.  </p>

		<p>Simonetta, try to keep something in mind, a hospital is a BUSINESS and must turn a PROFIT or close the doors like any business. No profit, those highly paid doctors don&rsquo;t get paid, no profit, that hospital becomes just another building with ILLEGALS squatting in it, no profit, it closes its doors as so many other hospitals have done for treating ILLEGAL ALIENS without compensation. Also! we taxpaying U.S. citizens are getting rather tired of supporting ILLEGAL ALIENS and muslims.</p>

<p>Dear Simonetta,<br>
As an insigificant white guy, who&rsquo;s probably just a complainer anyway, I humbly acknowledge your obvious and profound moral superiority.  That said, I had a few questions that only a cad would ask.  I hardly dare ask, but what corporation owns the University of Texas.  From your blog, it must not be the tax payer.  The doctors are usually salaried at public institutions, so how exactly&hellip;. oh well, forget that one, too confusing.  It seems the real culprits here are the tax payers and the insured patient, who aren&rsquo;t paying high enough taxes and insurance premiums to support the thousands of deliveries and emergency appendectomies on these poor, indigent and deserving illegals.  These young white families are certainly to be faulted for not paying high enough premiums to easily support this one surgery. on this obviously poor couple already living on welfare.  Why don&rsquo;t they just &#8220;shut up&#8221; as you say, and get these people help.  If you say The University of Texas, Medical Branch is inhuman, stupid, incompetent, and corrupt, who is anybody here, to question that apparent fact?  Your moral superiority holds sway.  </p>
<p>BTW  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just an IQ of near room temperature on my part, but I thought your last sentence lacked a certain tightness and coherency, which might preclude a foggy and dull mind from full comprehension of it&rsquo;s true and rich and diverse meaning. </p>

		<p>I live in Houston. God help me if me, my family, or my countrymen if we ever have to go to an emergency room in Houston for something really serious- because the long line in front of us includes many law breaking illegal aliens. Hospitals in Houston are routinely placed on drive-by status because they have no open beds. Guess who is in many of those beds? My wife and I have group health insurance at our small business. It cost us $1,100.00 per month and includes our son. The deductible is very high as well. The reason we pay so much (and we are healthy) is because we are subsidizing these illegal aliens. The situation is insane.</p>

		<p>I think our humanity should come first before the money and politics. Guess that&rsquo;s my personal feeling, esp. when it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s life on the line. That&rsquo;s why I wouldn&rsquo;t take the harsh route and say yes, treat her. </p>
<p>More important is the &#8220;why&#8221; are we not taking illegal seriously. I think we all know that reasons. People should be e-verified anywhere they apply for work, for renting, applying for anything including school. Proof of legal residence would put a stop to it. We could do it if our govt. would let us, but they don&rsquo;t want that. If we did, we wouldn&rsquo;t have illegals sucking the system dry, just like this example here.</p>

&#8220;I live in Houston. God help me if me, my family, or my countrymen if we ever have to go to an emergency room in Houston for something really serious- because the long line in front of us includes many law breaking illegal aliens. Hospitals in Houston are routinely placed on drive-by status because they have no open beds. Guess who is in many of those beds? My wife and I have group health insurance at our small business. It cost us $1,100.00 per month and includes our son. The deductible is very high as well. The reason we pay so much (and we are healthy) is because we are subsidizing these illegal aliens. The situation is insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well said Sir.  Now, if everybody with a similar situation would send that same info along to our brilliant &#8220;leaders&#8221; collectively on the same day perhaps we could start to make a dent.<br>
