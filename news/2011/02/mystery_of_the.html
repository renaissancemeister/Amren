			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Clifford Coonan, Independent (London), February 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For her advanced years, she looks remarkable. Despite nearing the ripe old age of 4,000, long eyelashes still frame her half-open eyes and hair tumbles down to her remarkably well-preserved shoulders.</p>
<p>But the opportunity for new audiences in the United States to view the &#8220;Beauty of Xiaohe&#8221;  &mdash;  a near perfectly preserved mummy from an inhospitable part of western China  &mdash;  has been dealt a blow after it was pulled from an exhibition following a sudden call from the Chinese authorities on the eve of opening. The reason for pulling the mummy and other artefacts from the show remained unclear yesterday (Chinese officials were on New Year holiday) but there were suggestions that the realities of modern Chinese politics may have had a part to play.</p>
<p>The mummy was recovered from China&rsquo;s Tarim Basin, in Xinjiang province. But her Caucasian features raised the prospect that the region&rsquo;s inhabitants were European settlers.</p>
<p>It raises the question about who first settled in Xinjiang and for how long the oil-rich region has been part of China. The questions are important  &mdash;  most notably for the Chinese authorities who face an intermittent separatist movement of nationalist Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people who number nine million in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The government-approved story of China&rsquo;s first contact with the West dates back to 200BC when China&rsquo;s emperor Wu Di wanted to establish an alliance with the West against the marauding Huns, then based in Mongolia. However, the discovery of the mummies suggests that Caucasians were settled in a part of China thousands of years before Wu Di: the notion that they arrived in Xinjiang before the first East Asians is truly explosive.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is dominated by the Uighurs, who resent what they see as intrusion by the Han Chinese. The tensions which have spilled over into violent clashes in recent years.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the Chinese decision, it has caused great disappointment at the Pennsylvania museum where the &#8220;Secrets of the Silk Road&#8221; were due to go on show after successful exhibitions in California and Texas without major reproductions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be the rebirth of this museum,&#8221; Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature, told the Associated Press last month. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to put it back on the map.&#8221;<br>

		<p>More than 100 years ago a German scientist went to the Himalaya.<br>
There he found a few folks which where neither Chinese, nor Indian. They were looking like European. In the Third Reich many scientist found a lot of blond mummies there.</p>
<p>Their conclusion, which is the common conclusion until today, was that Asia was once settled by nearly blond-only people. A very lot of blond mummies in Mongolia have already proofed that.</p>
<p>But the fact that whites can disappear with nearly nothing left from a whole continent is hidden because it would make more whites to think about facts.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind the Chinese trying to cover this up   &mdash;   after all, they&rsquo;re only looking after their own racial pride, however historically questionable.</p>
<p>What bothers me is the<i> White</i> &#8220;historians&#8221; who dismiss or minimize the growing evidence of an ancient-Caucasian presence in the far east.  Unlike the Chinese, these people despise their own race and will go out of their way to avoid admitting the vast White contributions to world history.</p>

<p>No, it was modern Chinese <i>racism</i> that had a part to play.  And far too many Westerners are willing to go along with it.</p>

		<p>For the Han, it isn&rsquo;t about White vs Yellow but about the miscegenation of both races in the ethnogenesis of Uighurs (along with C. Asian Turkic &amp; Persian language speakers) that worries Beijing because it gives Uighurs the right to claim Xinjiang on the basis of the R1a DNA of their fathers. E. Asians don&rsquo;t give a damn about being Yellow nor do they put all Whites in the same basket.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the difference who was there first.  The Hawaiians were first to settle in Hawaii, does that matter?  The Mexicans were in the south-west regions of the U.S.  That again doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the big deal here.</p>

		<p>We should have outbred the Asians.  Maybe our people back then were the equivalent of the metrosexual wimps that so plague our people now and just didn&rsquo;t up their birthrate to make the land theirs.</p>
<p>We Whites are at our best when we have a high birthrate.  It is then that we have vigor and outgoingness.  </p>

		<p>&hellip;And from what I understand, the original &#8220;buddah&#8221; was described as having &#8220;skin as white as china and eyes of fire blue ice&#8221;. The red chinese have been trying to suppress that one too. BUT WAIT!!! I thought only us white folks could be &#8220;raciss&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>These mummies were pre-white.  They are Aryans (pre-white). descendants of Adam and Eve.  They migrated out of the Middle East, the cradle of civilization, outward mainly to Europe, and some to China, India, Japan, etc.  They are the ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Aryans of India carrying advanced civilization and superior genes everywhere they went.  But eventually since their civilizations were not evolved, it gradually regressed to the levels of the peoples of the surrounding area.  It is similar to this country by letting in hordes of third world peoples, this country will regressed when the whites become the minority.  The Aryans that went to Europe, evolved into the white race by interbreeding with the blue race.  There were at least 7 races on this planet before some died out.  Adam and Eve descendants making up one of the 7 races.  The light eyes and hair came from Adam And Eve.  At one point, Adam and Eve pure descendants numbered about 4.5 million about 35,000 years ago. </p>

		<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize that the White mummies were actually discovered in China over a century ago. Historians and anthropologists simply didn&rsquo;t know how to explain it, so it was never really investigated or discussed. In subsequent years, embarrassed Chinese officials have been caught removing the heads from some mummies to hide the European features, as well as simply stacking mummies up like firewood in the supply closets of museums.</p>

		<p>What about the American government&rsquo;s treatment of Kenniwick Man, the best preserved skeleton recovered in North America.  When originally discovered, the locals thought a white man had been murdered.  Then it was given to scientists to research, and they found it to be 9,000 years old, as I recall.  Amerindians demanded the bones, based on an insane law passed during the Jimmy Carter administration.  Scientists were finally given a limited time to analyze it.  Then Pres. Clinton had it, and the site, covered with tons of dirt.  And the scientists decided the skeleton was not really white.  What makes it significant is that the bones were found in the western state of Washington, and they are older than any others.  Were white men in North American before the ancestors of the Amerindians?  China is not the only nation to try to spin archeological discoveries.</p>

		<p>This article and knowledge of Kennewick Man only cement my belief that there was once a world wide White presence.</p>
<p>All of History can be understood as a massive struggle of pure Whites building civilizations, and then having them collapse due to dysgenic mongrelization with lower Races.  </p>

The biggest threat to the white race is other (stupid do-gooder) whites. </p>

		<p>Shows how envious and resentful non-whites are towards whites. So what if the mummy&rsquo;s caucasian? It&rsquo;s fascinating and very much a part of Chinese history and opens new avenues for the Chinese to explore. They should be proud of it. If oriental-looking mummies were discovered in Montana, would the U.S. government stop it from being presented in public?</p>
<p>I hope they use modern technology to reconstruct how the mummy may have looked in real-life. She looked like a fine-looking woman and she is compelling as she is haunting.</p>

		<p>Greetings fellows! Since you are enthusiastic about history, I want to share with you the fact that researchers discovered that Chinese classic text Dao De Jing (by Lao-tzu) in addition to I Ching (Classic of Changes) are commentaries to Shan Hai Jing (Classic of Mountains and Seas). Each person is a bio-machine and has an individual program (sofware). All human programs are recorded inside an old Chinese manuscript known as Shan Hai Jing. In the beginning, all programs were recorded on a monument dating back to the 20 th century B.C.. Tao Te Ching</p>
