<h1>A Look at OSU&rsquo;s New Racial Categories</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Ijaz, UWeekly (Columbus), February 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week the Ohio State University Registrar issued new ethnic and racial categories for students to more accurately identify themselves. The U.S. Department of Education deemed the old categories no longer reflected the diversity of the nation&rsquo;s current populous.</p>
<p>But for some students, like Jamal Latiff, a third year molecular genetics student, the new categories don&rsquo;t accurately reflect their racial identity. Latiff is Arabian  &mdash;  half Lebanese and half Palestinian.</p>
<p>The new categories are as follows:</p>
<p>* American Indian or Alaska Native<br>
* Asian<br>
* Black or African American<br>
* Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander<br>
* White</p>
<p>According to Ohio State&rsquo;s (and other&rsquo;s) revised taxonomy, Arabians fall under the category White. The U.S. Department of Education defines &#8220;White&#8221; as, &#8220;A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whatever category Latiff decides, the choice will stay with him his entire college career. University admissions seek students who provide cultural, racial or geographic diversity.</p>
<p>According to the Ohio State Diversity Action Plan, the percent of Asian American students attending Ohio State rose by 57.9 percent in a span of six years. Similarly, the university&rsquo;s Hispanic American population shot up a whopping 70.6 percent.</p>
<p>A number of minority scholarships are specifically designed to increase the amount of students who belong to a certain race. The National Hispanic Recognition Program, for example, only awards Hispanics or Latinos. There are 435 similar scholarships.</p>
<p>Because the choice so heavily influences finances and enrollment, Latiff is hesitant to select &#8220;White.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one, the term &#8220;White&#8221; is delusive because Latiff&rsquo;s skin color is not of white pigment. On the contrary, many Middle Easterners have brown skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tend to stereotype white as being Caucasian,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Asian as being from the Far East, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education defines Asian as, &#8220;A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent.&#8221;</p>
<p>This excludes countries like Iran, Afghanistan and Lebanon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The document does, however, explicate why the Middle East doesn&rsquo;t have its own race category.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several comments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. viewed as necessary to monitor discrimination against this population,&#8221; it reads. &#8220;At the same time, it imposes the least possible data collection and reporting burden on the education community.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Part of the confusion arises from the nomenclature and semantics of the term race. The Revisions of 1997 emphasizes that the Department of Education&rsquo;s notion of race is &#8220;not anthropologically or scientifically based.&#8221; Instead, the department considered input from representatives of federal agencies, social science research institutions, interest groups, the private industry and letters when deciphering the meaning of race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The revisions build off of and are similar to the 2010 Census taxonomy. A central difference is the Census allows you to fill in your own ethnic group other than Hispanic/Latino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A less vocalized circle of critics advocates that any form of racial discrimination  &mdash;  government sponsored or not  &mdash;  impedes true equality.<br>

		<p>I think that I have a solution to this dilemma. Create two categories: One for non-wealthy heterosexual white males of European extraction, the other for all other people. This is the liberal goal. They will achieve it soon; so we may as well get it over with.</p>

		<p>Well this just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  I thought that being white meant a wealth of privilege.  Why would anyone run away from being classified as white?  What could be the reason?  </p>

		<p>Judging by the past &#8216;color revolutions&rsquo; in E. Europe and the current US-backed Islamist uprisings instigated by the Black Caliph Barak al Obama plus the ambiguous coverage in the Western media, soon a Muslim category will appear in America as the start of Sharia where Muslims get benefits over Christians because Gulf oil money owns enough of the American economy to control its govt, meaning that Bolsheviks have almost lost control of America. Obama is a sign of transition to ARAB supremacy.</p>

		<p>It appears that campus liberals are attempting to dilute the meaning of White. (Descendant of European Christendom)</p>
<p>They are working hard to blur the lines, thus leading to weakness, created by Nature itself in their bizarre Bolshevik mission to bring down Whites.  </p>

		<p>   I work at Ohio Statist University or as I prefer to call it, the &#8220;U.N. on the Olentangy&#8221;. This school panders to non-whites on a scale that I wouldn&rsquo;t believe were I not employed here. There is an endless barrage of seminars for and about the &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; black, asian, and especially as of late the hispanic students.<br>
   Last year we wasted a complete workday attending a program titled &#8220;Civility in the Workplace&#8221;. Basically, it was a reinforcement of the P.C. code that rules here. I have recently begun playing the lottery. It would be the only way out of here at my age.</p>

		<p>These people won&rsquo;t be happy until the last white male has been purged from every college (actually, I think they want us dead). It&rsquo;s already happened in the major colleges where the few remaining white males are the idiot sons of the old elite who founded them.</p>

		<p>Defining whiteness down is obviously cultural genocide designed to smooth the segue into the physical variety.  It&rsquo;s easier when you define them out of existence before putting them out of existence. </p>

<p>Am I missing something here? How can you insist on diversity of race when race officially doesn&rsquo;t exist?  OSU receives Federal funds yet openly announces that it discriminates on the basis of race.  </p>

<p>Why would he be hesitant to select &#8220;White&#8221;? Could it be that doing so would negatively influence his chances of financing and enrollment? Naaah. That couldn&rsquo;t be it. Because Tick Tock Timmy assures us that whites enjoy &#8220;privilege&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Why is it, that the racial catagories(excluding white) have names such as &#8220;African American&#8221; &#8220;American Indian&#8221; &#8220;Asian&#8221; that pay some respect to their origin, but we just have &#8220;white&#8221;. </p>

<p>The white race is a genetic category.  America is part of the family of white countries.  </p>
<p>If we ever start playing the identity game on their terms, then we&rsquo;ve accepted that we&rsquo;re just one minority special interest among many.</p>
