<p>Michael Sheridan, Daily News (New York), February 17, 2011</p>

<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 16-year-old [Kendall Anderson] allegedly told police he decided to kill his mother, Rashida Anderson, after a 90-minute argument that culminated in her taking the video-game console away.</p>
<p>Anderson considered his actions before killing his 37-year-old single mother, said the judge who read the teen&rsquo;s statement in Philadelphia Municipal Court. The teen paced for three hours mulling over what he would do before deciding to kill her, said his confession, which he gave to a police detective.</p>
<p>Anderson struck her 20 times with a claw hammer while she slept.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Anderson was charged with murder in December, as well as possession of an instrument of a crime and abuse of a corpse.</p>
<p>The teen was not known to be violent, but had been charged with stealing a laptop from his high school.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could, I would not do it again,&#8221; he said in his confession. &#8220;I really miss my mom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was the only person who cared for me.&#8221;</p>
