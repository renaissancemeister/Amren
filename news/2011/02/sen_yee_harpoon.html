<h1>Sen. Yee Harpoons Shark Fin Bill</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Upton, Bay Citizen, February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the debate over the sale of shark fin, what is a Chinese-American candidate for mayor of famously environmentally conscious San Francisco to do?</p>
<p>On Monday, Sen. Leland Yee (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) sided firmly with Chinese-Americans against environmentalists in an escalating debate about the controversial ingredient.</p>
<p>Shark fin soup is a cultural delicacy normally enjoyed banquet-style on special occasions. But shark fins make environmentalists seethe with anger because of the cruel way in which they are often harvested.</p>
<p>Yee, who announced his mayoral candidacy last November, held a press conference Monday in San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown to denounce new state legislation that would ban the sale of shark fin.</p>
<p>Yee has recently battled on behalf of Chinese-Americans to allow live animals to be imported into California for sale in markets and to allow noodles to be served at room temperature.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that there are more and more examples where individuals or groups of individuals are trying to limit our heritage and our culture,&#8221; Yee, flanked by supportive restaurateurs and chefs, told reporters before evoking memories of racism against Chinese-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not so many years ago that, if you happened to be Chinese, you could not go to school outside of Chinatown,&#8221; Yee said.</p>
<p>One shark fin, shredded, provides enough meat for a 20-person banquet, restaurant industry members said during the press conference.</p>
<p>Yee criticized the legislation, introduced Monday by Bay Area assemblymen Paul Fong (D-Cupertino) and Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael), as being overreaching and insensitive. He said it unfairly bans the sale of all fins, including those from sustainably harvested sharks.</p>
<p>Fishermen who only want the shark&rsquo;s fins cut them off and toss the animals back in the water, where they die. The practice is illegal in United States waters. The practice of finning is blamed by environmental groups, including Pacific Environment, for a dramatic decline in population numbers. Marine ecosystems can be thrown out of balance when the top predators disappear.</p>

		<p>Its very interesting that the Chinese can adulterate food that we import from China but cannot stand the idea of using of maybe creating some sort of substitute for shark fin to eat that does not involve maiming some innocent sea creature. Could it be they have no imagination. While I have nothing against the chinese as a whole but I find their culture rather revolting in some ways.</p>

<p>Ah, but no one is limiting Chinese heritage and culture.  We&rsquo;re just saying that it will not override American heritage and culture, for those who live in America.  Yee can always move to China to have that culture.<br>

		<p>More powerfull evidence that Chinese legal immigrants and their &#8220;American&#8221; born geneline pose a very serious threat to America&rsquo;s wildlife. Last week, a black bear cub was carved up in the bucolic Shennandoah Valley for its gall bladder to be sold as a male fertility enhancer in a Chinese &#8220;American&#8221; drugstore in the overpopulated state of California,a state whose human population is exploding because of the importation of post-1965 high fertility Asians and other nonwhite high fertility groups.</p>
<p>The state of Virginia&rsquo;s river system is now infested with the Chinese snakehead fish-including the dangerous giant snakehead fish. The snakehead is an ecologically destabilizing species. It was introduced into the Virginia river system by a Chinese legal immigrant. His sister-also a legal immigrant from China-had just recovered in a Virginia hospital from a near fatal condition. It is a Chinese tradition that when something like this occurs a family member must release a snakehead fish into a river. Her brother- in keeping with this Chinese tradition-did just this. This releasing of one snakehead fish into the Potomac River in Virginia has ignited an ecological catastrophe from which the river systems in state of Virginia may never recover. I am not making any of this up.</p>
<p>And I am not making this up either. As I previously mentioned, California&rsquo;s human population is exploding because of high fertility post-1965 nonwhite immigrants. The states endngered species are under very serious threat of total extinction because of this. Chinese legal immigrants in California are now digging up their dead ancestors in China and Taiwan and reburying them in land scarce California&hellip;and California is very land scarce if you take seriously the idea of protecting California&rsquo;s endemic and endangered species.</p>

		<p>Chinamen are by far the worst abusers of animals on the planet, and it must be genetic.I saw something on television about them skinning some kind of small mammals ALIVE,without having the decency to kill them first. They died a slow, painful death,skinned of their hide.Take a walkough Chinatown in SF,and you will be heartbroken after aeeing how badly they treat animals that they are selling.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re so concerned with your Chinese &#8220;heritage and our culture&#8221; being limited, perhaps you should go back to China where you are free to engage in as much culture as needed. </p>
<p>BTW, anyone who has ever seen &#8220;fining&#8221; practiced would be appalled at the cruel and barbaric nature in which the Chinese butcher the shark, throw it back into the water while still alive, only for the shark to suffer what must be a excruciating and slow death by drowning. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m by no means a PETA alarmist, but what these people do to sharks in order to practice their &ldquo;culture&rdquo; is truly disturbing. <br>

		<p>I agree with comment #4 by Peejay how sad it is to walk through San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown and see how these people keep fish, frogs, turtles, etc.. living in such inhumane conditions. Of course their &#8220;culture&#8221; being preserved is more important than treating animals in a respectful way. I wonder if Leland Yee would agree that it is preserving Mexican &#8220;culture&#8221; to have cockfights. I am not a supporter of PETA, animals do not have rights, but animals should not be made to suffer and should be given respect as a living breathing creature.</p>

		<p>Yee has given me a ton of material with which to work. </p>
<p>1- Shark fin may be a &#8220;cultural delicacy&#8221;. But among the Bantus of the Congo eating <i>Pygmies</i> is also a cultural delicacy. Sometimes the  cultural delicacy argument just doesn&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>2- Shark fin may be part of their culture. But it wasn&rsquo;t part of their culture to hunt sharks with modern ships powered with gas engines and hydraulic harpoons. If people want to eat shark fin the traditional way then they need to catch them the traditional way.</p>
<p>3- Animal welfare groups haven&rsquo;t focused on shark fins any more than they have focused on whaling, wearing fur or clubbing baby seals. Animal rights groups haven&rsquo;t made Chinese &#8220;culture&#8221; an issue. Yee has. He has played the &#8220;race card&#8221;.</p>

When Asian immigrants engage in the environmental damage of American soil, their activities force America to ask why they should own the privelege of being an American.</p>
<p>Chinese spies know that America is sailing on a course of obedience.<br>
As long as Americans allow the fed to decide for us, that non-whites are able to uphold the country we rssurrected by our hard work and sweat, China will not only aid Washington in the environmental and genetic damage of our people, but invest money in it until our way of life is nothing more than wind driven sand.</p>

		<p>I must agree with Peejay in Frisco&rsquo;s comment about Chinese being the worst people on the planet for animal abuse and refusing to change traditional and unsustainable practices in regard to now-endangered animal species. I have Oriental in-laws so I know a little about this first-hand. There could be ten tigers left in the world and most Orientals would have no problem whatsoever killing them for their balls or eyeballs or whatever so that they can concoct some &#8220;traditional medicine&#8221; for treating impotence or whatever. If the world loses its European peoples, it will also lose the concept of altruism, empathy for other living things, and the concept of ecosystem sustainability.</p>

		<p>USA, Australia, NZ and most other western nations have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect our environment, from major national parks to protection of seemingly insignificant endangered spieces.Western Nations also have very strict animal cruelty laws.</p>
<p>Now we see this article re shark fin harvesting, goes completely against all cruely and conservation laws. We now have Halal slaughter practiced in the West, this also goes against all animal cruelty laws. Here in Australia Aboriginals are allowed to spear endangered turtle species under exemptions for traditional owners, this is both cruel and wrong. I have just read about illegal undersized and over-quota shellfish harvesting in NZ, needless to say the offenders were Asian.</p>
<p>Where are all the ourtraged do-gooders in these very real concerns?</p>
<p>Even in these matters we just seem to entering a new dark age. The West must continue to stand up for the enlightened civilization we have built.</p>

		<p>To poster #4, sadly it is all true.  I have extensive experience with Chinese people and the callous ways in which they treat animals made me sick before I ever realized how wrong it was to mistreat any living thing.  (The trendy craze of the &#8216;toy&rsquo; dogs of the last few years is in itself another kind of cruelty.)</p>
<p>The problem is that Chinese culture learned to be very utilitarian about animals centuries ago.  There were always too many mouths too feed, so you eat whatever you find, and have no regard for how it dies.  I could tell you stories of things I saw&hellip;.</p>
<p>You know we will be seeing a lot more battles like this in the future with every ethnic and racial group advancing its values, no matter how cruel, primitive or oddball.  Those really poor saps otherwise known as liberals thought they could bring in the world and only experience the good in every culture in this land.</p>
<p>I am not joking when I say that you will see child brides, bizarre rituals, beheadings, blood fueds, lots of violence against women and a whole host of weird behaviors defended by their perpetrators as &#8216;our culture&rsquo; in the near future.</p>
<p>About 2-3 years ago, a school principal in NYC was found to have performed a santeria ritual in her school after hours to &#8216;cleanse it.&rsquo;  The paid santeria priest killed a chicken and sprinkled its blood in the hallways.  </p>
<p>The nyc dept of ed fired the principal, who was of haitian descent, but it wasn&rsquo;t the ritual that surprised me, but the fact that those liberal, diversity-now people in the establishment decided that her culture wasn&rsquo;t worth &#8216;respecting.&rsquo;  Seems they&rsquo;re hypocrites.</p>

		<p>A far more common ingredient in Chinese dining in China is dog.  Shark is expensive, Dog is not so expensive.</p>
<p>When your dog is trapped unaware and ends up on someone&rsquo;s table, will the Chinese who did it be able to say their &#8220;heritage&#8221; is being oppressed by white racists?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in China, and know that, even there, it&rsquo;s common to lure a dog into a closed room by tying up a bitch in heat there, and then beating the trapped animal to death before eating it.  I know someone whose own relatives did this, without knowing whose dog they&rsquo;d killed.  When one of the dinner guests arrived and noticed the dead dogs hide, he said, &#8220;That was MY dog!&#8221;  This is a true story.</p>

		<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The damage Asians have been doing in California and the West has been going on for several decades and only grows worse.  Vietnamese were first killing ducks in parks and their neighbors cats and dogs, but soon went into endeavors like commercial fishing, catching over limits and undersized fish.  Then came the abalone poachers.  Just 50 years ago, you could harvest an abalone by wading in a tide pool to your knees.  Today, it requires a full scuba outfit and a big risk to find one.  That is because Asians, all groups have in turn run abalone poaching rings.  Sea Urchins have also been over harvested and are at risk.  It goes on and on.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t all either.  Chinese have raided nearly all the mushroom producing forests in the Northwest where mushrooms fields in forests which had been carefully harvested, preserving the mycelium beds for decades providing the same gormet restaurateurs with the delicacies, were destroyed in a couple seasons by Chinese harvesters who raked everything they could and destroyed the fields.  In Washington State, Russian immigrants have done the same as well as snag hooked endangered salmon and all other fish, even when they are spawning.  They have shot deer and elk out of season, and generally run wild through the forests, doing what they please.  In a few short years, there will be nothing left of America&rsquo;s wild heritage.  Even the traditional American hunter will be eliminated, except for canned hunts, which already exist for the wealthy &#8220;sportsman.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s over folks, our country is being raped and finished off before our eyes.</p>
<p>The appetite that Chinese have for their superstitious medical treatments are affecting the wild creatures of both land and sea, and on a huge scale.  I have always thought that the Chinese have some positive traits, but they have more destructive ones than positive.  It really is scary that they comprise such a large portion of the world&rsquo;s population and look to become the dominant culture in the future until - I guess everything is used up and we begin to eat one another.</p>

		<p>I have said this for years- laws to protect animals are the next victims of diversity. The race card will be played.  As Orientals grow in power in the US and Canada they will become more and more brazen about claiming it&rsquo;s &#8216;cultural bias&rsquo; to not slaughter dogs for food, etc. We&rsquo;ll also see the alleged &#8216;right wing&rsquo; libertarian nuts come up with solutions like allowing tiger farming. </p>
<p>Well also see the US look the other way or be hesitant to prosecute orientals caught exporting/importing tiger powder and other nonsense. <br>

		<p>As a hunter in Germany, we are taught to manage our game to improve the strength of the herds.  When we must dispatch an animal, doing it with a single well-placed shot is our goal.  After the animal is dead, it is respectfully offered a ceremonial last bite of foliage.  Willfully causing any animal to suffer, or allowing it to do so by negligence is either illegal or goes against hundreds of years of tradition.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the evil treatment of animals by the Chinese, and then decide whose traditions deserve to be preserved.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t give a darn about sharks one way or the other but I would question the shark harvesting methods. </p>
<p>Why would fishermen from a country populated by 1.3 billion people just harvest the shark fin? The Chinese really have a hard time providing enough protein for their population and have even been known to sell human meat. Why would they be so wastefull when it comes to shark?</p>
<p>I was brought up to hunt and fish for food but never to be wastefull. </p>

		<p>They certainly didn&rsquo;t have much concern for their own kind during the Cultural Revolution, with estimates of Maoist purges killing or starving as many as 65 million Chinese. Why would anybody expect such a hive-mind people to have the slightest empathy for animals?       </p>

<p>I vividly recall the conversation I was informed about then in Russia. The party bosses were puzzled over a forceful and impolite request from China Communist Party to share with them ANY scientific and technological knowledge. In spite of all the UNLIMITED money poured in the Chinese &#8220;scientists and engineers&#8221; those were utterly unable to create even a toaster. Their success was based on stealing and back engineering from abroad. </p>

		<p>Years ago prior to WW II my father was stationed in China with The US Army&rsquo;s 15th Inf Regiment and part of the newcomers briefing included eating and drinking off-post.  This briefing was usually given by a Senior NCO or Officer and when it came to eating off-post in Chinese establishments some of the briefers would tell the soldiers &#8220;what you call an eating establishment here in China, back home in the USA, we call them pet shops&#8221;.  My father would discover the locals would consume just about anything that walked, crawled, flew, lived in the water, or grew freely(ie:  grass soup).  To the day of his passing he would never eat rice nor eat in a Chinese eating joint.  He stated that those that ate the local food or went &#8220;native&#8221;were called &#8220;China Dogs&#8221;.  </p>

&#8220;I must agree with Peejay in Frisco&rsquo;s comment about Chinese being the worst people on the planet for animal abuse and refusing to change traditional and unsustainable practices in regard to now-endangered animal species. I have Oriental in-laws so I know a little about this first-hand. There could be ten tigers left in the world and most Orientals would have no problem whatsoever killing them for their balls or eyeballs or whatever so that they can concoct some &ldquo;traditional medicine&rdquo; for treating impotence or whatever. If the world loses its European peoples, it will also lose the concept of altruism, empathy for other living things, and the concept of ecosystem sustainability.&#8221;</p>

I generally like Asian people and the greater part of their history and culture but when it comes to the gastronomic aspect, I have to agree with you heartily and commend you for the articulate and passionate way that you stated your case.<br>
The Chinese appear to have a major foothold in Africa and I just read that they are going to build roadways through a part of Africa ( Serengetti?) that is part of the &#8220;Great Migration&#8221; route of Wildebeest and other herbivours. This will constiture a major interruption of something that has been going on for thousands of years. Poachers (predominantly Bantu who seem to have no regard for the riches of their wildlife, some of which exist nowhere else in the world) will have a field day slaughtering these animals by the thousands. I&rsquo;m sure the Chinese will do their part for Rhino horns, Elephant tusks and whatever else serves to increase their sexual potency. ( What is their problem? They already constitute one seventh of the total world population! Is that right? I was always weak in math.) </p>
<p>As Euro-Americans we probably made our mistakes as well e.g. the near total extermination of the North American Bison, but we learned and now are the chief stewards of the Fauna. The rest of humanity couldn&rsquo;t care less. <br>
Anyway, if there ever comes the day when we Caucasians cease to exist as a people, this world is finished. All our animals will be robotic as envisioned by Philip K. Dick.</p>

<p>You will give a darn when your favorite ox in being gored.  Maybe then you will understand why giving a darn about a shark was important.  But it will be (and is) too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would fishermen from a country populated by 1.3 billion people just harvest the shark fin? The Chinese really have a hard time providing enough protein for their population and have even been known to sell human meat. Why would they be so wastefull when it comes to shark?</p>
<p>I was brought up to hunt and fish for food but never to be wastefull.&#8221;</p>
<p>1. They believe that things like fins and horns increase sexual potency and libido.</p>
<p>2.  Isn&rsquo;t it also wasteful to kill wild animals for the thrill of it when the supermarkets are full of food, and it is actually cheaper to go there?  Why not hunt with a camera?</p>
<p>PS I used to hunt too, but quit because it seemed that too many were going for the same animal, even stealing kills if they got to them first.  Also, hunters have become increasingly dangerous in the forests to others and themselves, drinking and partying when off the hunt, sometimes clashing with other hunters (and fishermen) (Northwest).</p>

<p>That is so wild because it made me think of something we see around in NYC all summer.  We have so many Asians in certain areas now.  </p>
<p>I am not joking when I say that in the public parks you will see large groups of old oriental ladies, crouching down in the grass, plucking tons of green plants and putting them in bags.  </p>
<p>They literally strip a field bare in a couple of days and go on to the next.  They harvest dandelion leaves, acorns, and a few other small plant types I don&rsquo;t know the name of.  They leave nothing behind.</p>
<p>Mind you these orientals around here tend to be very well off, but all their grandmothers (imported here on full social security of course) go out and scratch in the parks for weeds.  Edible - yes, but weeds nonetheless.</p>
<p>I stopped seeing any stray dogs years ago.  (Probably all eaten) and in some areas you don&rsquo;t see any stray cats anymore. </p>

		<p>I can definitely sense one thing from reading this forum:that people in 20th century America are completely and utterly disconnected from the process of food production.  What&rsquo;s food production?  The systematic raising and slaughtering of animals.  Think of it the sandwich that you ate today, it probably has meat in it.  Where did that meat come from?  It came from some animal that was killed in a modern slaughterhouse and produced on some &#8220;factory style&#8221; farm.</p>
<p>This is how food is produced in the West:</p>

<p>About shark harvesting methods there probably isn&rsquo;t a large market for shark steak,I&rsquo;ve had in it&rsquo;s quite good.  So it&rsquo;s probably far more profitable to just cut away the fin.  I prefer eating shark steak (which is exquisite) to the fin(which is mediocre at best) so I think it&rsquo;s a waste too.  </p>

		<p>I can only agree with those saying the Asians have an incredibly reckless way of treating the environment. I remember even as a kid, fishing at a pier we used to go to now and then, the Asians who would sometimes be there would keep everything they caught - much well below the size minimum stipulated by law. Tiny crabs, well-undersized fish, etc. There really is not the slightest consideration for the condition they leave the environment in for others. And as their wealth and consumption demand increases, I can only imagine the Chinese using their ever-increasing political clout to tap into the few remaining resource-rich waters of the world. If Japan is bad enough I don&rsquo;t look forward to what China is going to try to get up to.</p>

		<p>Chinese will skewer a cat with a hook through the top of it&rsquo;s jaw, drop it in boiling water and then pull the skin off to leave the animal hanging, still alive and breathing while they prepare the rest of the meal that goes with.</p>
<p>I have _seen this_, in restaurants.</p>
<p>And there are two reasons why shark&rsquo;s have little useful meat:</p>
<p>1.  The flesh is very tough and fibrous.<br>
Verging on inedible is because it is a cartilagenous fish with a matrix of cells like those in your nose throughout it&rsquo;s upper tissues.  This is nominally to provide low-drag shape reinforcement at a variety of depths without swim bladder and yet sustain flexibility as maneuverability in rapid propulsive movements.</p>
<p>2.  They are garbage disposals.<br>
While it is true that sharks have low rates of toxicity driven diseases, the reason is that their livers and gall bladders are HUGE.  And soak up all manner of (mercury, plasticizers etc.) toxins, poisoning the rest of the organs.  Top Predators are always barometer species for things like DDT for this reason, eating everything below them as a cumulative measure of environmental contamination.  While the Eskimo saying: &#8220;Never eat what a dog won&rsquo;t&#8221; has some application here, sharks are worse because, ironically, their eyes have very poor shape definition as a function of 3D depth perception.  They can&rsquo;t tell the difference between a can of paint and a dead fish.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It was not so many years ago that, if you happened to be Chinese, you could not go to school outside of Chinatown,&rdquo; Yee said.</p>
<p> Not many years ago? I still have my Kindergarten class picture from 1964. I attended Francis Scott Key Elementary School in San Francisco&rsquo;s (now ruined) Sunset District. There were Chinese kids in that class-even in those days the Richmond District, virtually identical to the (then)nearly all-white Sunset District and located on the other side of Golden Gate Park..was heavily Chinese. My own Mother attended SF&rsquo;s Gallileo High in the 1940&rsquo;s and almost half her classmates were Chinese. Who does Yee think he&rsquo;s kidding? I knew kids that went to Chinese secondary schools-that was their parent&rsquo;s choice. I have never in my lifetime, with the exception of the occasional bit of name-calling, seen any real examples of overt, collective racism towards Asians in SF. In fact, they are a very priveleged &#8220;minority&#8221;. You can thank former Mayoress Dianne Feinstein for that-the Hong Kong invasion kicked into high gear with her administration. </p>
<p>  Yee&rsquo;s defense of what to all real Americans are barbaric and superstitious practices shows that these people no longer fear any native reaction to their alien attitudes-they&rsquo;ve dropped the other shoe.</p>
<p>  I hate it that I wish the city of my birth would drop into the Pacific&hellip;that&rsquo;s how awful it is to see it now.</p>

		<p>I, too, question Mr. Yee&rsquo;s comment that Chinese did not attend school outside of Chinatown. While I cannot speak for California, in 1946 New Haven, CT this was not the case. My mother&rsquo;s high school 1946 yearbook shows several students of Japanese and Chinese descent.</p>

		<p>Animal life is more important than human culture.  If sharks are so inedible, as some here have pointed out, then quit trying to eat them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the world of economy and industry wouldn&rsquo;t miss commercial shark fishing, any more than it misses commercial whaling or the slave trade.</p>

		<p>The Chinese have a much more archaic view (by Western standards) of animal life born of desperation, stemming from the fact that nearly are recently descended from extreme poverty (which many there still live in), and from China&rsquo;s past history of devastating famines (the most recent in the mid-20th Century as a result of Mao&rsquo;s Great Leap Forward).</p>
<p>Some arises from superstitious beliefs (probably also tied to until extreme poverty- they attribute foods to &#8220;cold&#8221; and &#8220;hot&#8221; elements of the body. Despite the fact that roast duck is served cooked, it is considered a &#8220;cold&#8221; food because ducks swim in cold water, so pregnant women are not supposed to eat them.</p>
<p>Some are practical, or once were. Meat is to be killed very freshly- ideally you do it yourself or witness it done. Probably arose from lack of proper refrigeration and other things we take for granted. This gives rise to many views of animal cruelty by Chinese, who still practice it despite having access to modern refrigeration. Even in the US they prefer drinking hot water (recently boiled) instead of cold, despite the fact that the water here (at least in most regions) is clean to drink already.</p>
<p>They famously also eat everything- shark fin, dog, etc- probably as a result of a history of famine and poverty.<br>
