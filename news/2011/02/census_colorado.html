<h1><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_17467841?source=rss">Census: Colorado&rsquo;s Population Substantially More Diverse</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ingold, Denver Post, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Colorado&rsquo;s population became substantially more diverse over the past decade, and the changes were especially noticeable among young people, according to new Census Bureau figures released Wednesday.</p>
<p>People identifying themselves as white fell from nearly 75 percent of the state&rsquo;s population in 2000 to about 70 percent in 2010. Hispanics filled most of the gap, rising from 17 percent of the population to nearly 21 percent. The relative representation of black and Asian residents, as well as people identifying themselves as multiracial, also increased.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight of Colorado&rsquo;s 64 counties saw their proportion of white residents fall. Elizabeth Garner, the state demographer, said that is a departure from standard perceptions that diversity is mostly an urban phenomenon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you see diversity increasing all through the state regardless,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s more diverse in every community.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But most pronounced were changes in the state&rsquo;s racial and ethnic makeup.</p>
<p>Garfield, Arapahoe and Adams counties all saw their proportion of white residents decline by more than 10 percentage points. The figures confirm that Aurora is the first major city in the state to be a &#8220;minority-majority&#8221; city, with nearly 53 percent of its residents identifying as nonwhite.</p>
<p>Census surveys in the last decade had estimated that Denver County was minority-majority, but the figures released Wednesday show it as being 52 percent white and one of the few counties in Colorado to see an increase  &mdash;  albeit less than 1 percentage point  &mdash;  in its proportion of white residents.</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s diversification was especially apparent among its youths. In 2000, 66 percent of residents under 18 were white. In 2010, that dropped to less than 58 percent. Overall, the number of nonwhite youths increased by nearly 39 percent, while the number of white youths dropped by nearly 3 percent.</p>

		<p>I think Colorado might be a lost cause for Republicans forever.  If they couldn&rsquo;t win Governor and Senate (Hickenlooper won with a majority, FTR), last November, on a day when Republicans had the red wind to their backs, then 2012 and beyond is hopeless.  Mainly because of Hispanics and white former California liberals fleeing the system they created and chopping up former Front Range cattle ranches in order to pretend they&rsquo;re cattle ranchers while voting liberal Democrat.</p>

		<p>Wallow in all your glorious &#8220;diversity&#8221; now, you smug clowns - when the day comes much of your state more resembles a third-world pesthole than a once fully civilized paradise, we&rsquo;ll see how wonderful you think it is!</p>

		<p>Colorado&rsquo;s population became substantially more diverse over the past decade</p>
<p>I wonder if murder, rape, robbery, drug activity, property damage, high school drop outs, and gang activity increased?</p>
<p>I think we can agree that certain states, like California, are done for.  But Colorado?  I had no idea it was this bad.  The death rattle of whites in America will happen before I die of natural causes (I&rsquo;m in my 20&rsquo;s), in my opinion.  </p>
<p>The real question is, will we let out a whimper or a roar before we die out or flee the country?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if conservatives are really beneficial. Maybe lesser of the two evils?</p>

		<p>this whole country is falling fast by using hispanics to decrease the white majority.  Why, to decrease the global power of this country?  All this will backfire on the shadowy government doing this.  The white race will come back stronger.</p>

		<p>As a Colorado Resident, I can tell you it&rsquo;s much worse the stats let on. Every neighborhood short of half million dollar homes has been substantially browned. The blacks that poured out of big cities, chased out by the rampant Mexican influx (which seeks to wipe out blacks) are all here, more every single day. More and more and more, everywhere you turn.<br>
Mexicans are everywhere. </p>
<p>And the sick irony (but isn&rsquo;t sick irony the business of all MSM outlets), is that the headlines eother celebrating diversity or just stating it&hellip;are ALWAYS right next to headlines in the same paper, stating schools are nose diving, social services are failing, and turf wars are epidemic.</p>

		<p>Is it really &#8220;diversity&#8221; when it has been forced by government mandate?  Why is it a sin to let ethnicities, including whites, form their own communities?  As long as we keep America in sight it shouldn&rsquo;t matter if I want to live in a white neighborhood.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be a stretch that I would prefer white section 8 renters either though that really is the lesser of 2 evils.<br>

		<p>Why are people surprised&hellip;.Colorado is part of those states set to be colonized through the reconquista by illegal invading mexicans. California has been pretty much annexed by mexico; Nevada re-elected illegal invader hugger Harry Reid, who went straight to work to ensure Nevada is surrendered. Texas is on shaky ground, while Arizona is fighting back. It remains to be seen how that will turn out.  New Mexico is anyone&rsquo;s guess at the moment. </p>
<p>Looks as if the reconquista is moving along as planned, while the MSM celebrates under the banner of &#8220;multiculturism and diversity.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Colorado is probably even worse off than you think.  Minorities are usually undercounted.  If Ken Buck couldn&rsquo;t win in November, then Colorado is probably gone.  Maybe Nevada too.  Then you add to the minorities in those states the liberal fake, phony, fraud whites fleeing California.  I get a sick satisfaction seeing these liberal whites feeling the mess they&rsquo;ve created.  Lots of them are probably well-off and can afford to move from state to state to escape.  Millions of whites can&rsquo;t.  But people with Section 8 vouchers can!</p>

		<p>Diverse = as in less homogenity in peace, safety, and intelligence. Now we get a full range from psychotic violence to Third World values. Enjoy it, Colorado. I won&rsquo;t be crying for you when you figure out just what all this will mean for your once high standard of living.</p>
