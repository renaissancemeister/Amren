<h1>Junk Food Diet Linked to Lower IQ  &mdash;  Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AFP, February 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toddlers who have a diet high in processed foods may have a slightly lower IQ in later life, according to a British study described as the biggest research of its kind.</p>
<p>The conclusion, published on Monday, comes from a long-term investigation into 14,000 people born in western England in 1991 and 1992 whose health and well-being were monitored at the ages of three, four, seven and eight and a half.</p>
<p>Parents of the children were asked to fill out questionnaires that, among other things, detailed the kind of food and drink their children consumed.</p>
<p>Three dietary patterns emerged: one was high in processed fats and sugar; then there was a &#8220;traditional&#8221; diet high in meat and vegetables; and finally a &#8220;health-conscious&#8221; diet with lots of salad, fruit and vegetables, pasta and rice.</p>
<p>When the children were eight and a half, their IQ was measured using a standard tool called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale.</p>
<p>Of the 4,000 children for which there were complete data, there was a significant difference in IQ among those who had had the &#8220;processed&#8221; as opposed to the &#8220;health-conscious&#8221; diets in early childhood.</p>
<p>The 20 percent of children who ate the most processed food had an average IQ of 101 points, compared with 106 for the 20 percent of children who ate the most &#8220;health-conscious&#8221; food.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a very small difference, it&rsquo;s not a vast difference,&#8221; said one of the authors, Pauline Emmett of the School of Social and Community Medicine at the University of Bristol.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it does make them less able to cope with education, less able to cope with some of the things in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The association between IQ and nutrition is a strongly debated issue because it can be skewed by many factors, including economic and social background.</p>
<p>A middle-class family, for instance, may arguably be more keen (or more financially able) to put a healthier meal on the table, or be pushier about stimulating their child, compared to a poorer household.</p>
<p>Emmett said the team took special care to filter out such confounders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have controlled for maternal education, for maternal social class, age, whether they live in council housing, life events, anything going wrong, the home environment, with books and use of television and things like that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The size of the study, too, was unprecedented.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a huge sample, it&rsquo;s much much bigger than anything anyone else has done,&#8221; she said in an interview with AFP.</p>
<p>Emmett said further work was needed to see whether this apparent impact on IQ persisted as the children got older.</p>
<p>Asked why junk food had such an effect, she suggested a diet that was preponderantly processed could lack vital vitamins and elements for cerebral development at a key stage in early childhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;A junk food diet is not conducive to good brain development,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The paper appears in the peer-reviewed Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, published by the British Medical Association (BMA).<br>

		<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s because smarter people who produce smarter children consciously choose to eat less junk food.</p>
<p>Notice they&rsquo;re saying that a 5 IQ point difference is not insignificant.  That&rsquo;s a really big admission for the politically correct media, the same one that demands that we lower our national average IQ by that or more through mass immigration.</p>

		<p>Has anyone else ever noticed how IQ tests never have any cultural bias when liberals need them? (i.e. &#8216;This prisoner is mentally retarded and therefor can&rsquo;t be executed?&rsquo;)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when we use them that they are flawed.</p>

		<p>I personally believe in good nutrition for a host of reasons, but I wonder about things like this study.  Looking back throughout history, some of the greatest minds in Western civilization had poor diets.  Plato and Aristotle lived on bread and olives.  Even many of the Roman intelligensia rarely had fresh vegetables. Their foods weren&rsquo;t processed and loaded with sugar like ours today so maybe that has something to do with it.   </p>

Is this the chicken and the egg?</p>
<p>Do low IQ people eat lower nutrition food or does lower nutrition stunt IQ?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely a mix of both but 5 points isn&rsquo;t a great deal.</p>
<p>Even if blacks ate better, how much difference could it make?</p>
<p>The good thing about his piece is that anyone who cites it is admitting IQ is real and measurable.<br>
 <br>
So when blacks refer to black kids needing better nutrition to raise their IQ they&rsquo;re admitting IQ is real.</p>

		<p>While poor nutrition can affect brain development, the authors of this study seem to have missed one vital point. Those with lower IQs are less likely to eat healthy. Since intelligence is inherited, this should be obvious to most, except the liberal blank slaters, of whose camp these &#8220;scientistS&#8221; are mostly likely part of.</p>

		<p>I thought I.Q. was meaningless. Could it be that parents who feed their children poor diets have low I.Q.s which is the reason their children have low I.Q.s. Same thing goes for infant mortality and general good health. BTW  I see many cases of sickle cell anemia among blacks from the carribean. I wonder if Obama will provide free genetic counseling so black people will be more care about who they have sex with.LOL</p>

		<p>Interesting study.  A Jamaican expat once told me that it was not uncommon for children of Jamaica to grow up exclusively on a diet of food grown close to home in organic conditions.  Often, the child never experiences sugary junk foods.</p>
<p>When Jamaicans live abroad in the West, their diet changes. </p>
<p>It was called to my attention later that the murder rate among Jamaicans in Canada is about the same as it is in their homeland.</p>

		<p>What I find interesting about all this is that no one seemed to dare to broach the question of whether a higher IQ might cause parents to give their children healthier diets in the first place. Liberals can&rsquo;t stand this kind of question because it puts power in the hands of the people rather than the elites, so they scream that it&rsquo;s &#8220;blaming the victim.&#8221; </p>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s interesting to notice is that no one denies that the concept of intelligence actually exists. It&rsquo;s not like race, which libs claim is a &#8220;social construct.&#8221; They never claim that intelligence is merely a &#8220;social construct,&#8221; that it doesn&rsquo;t exist (although that may be next). </p>
<p>This is the big flaw in liberals insistence that studies showing IQ difference between the races is &#8220;pseudoscience.&#8221; Without anyone seeming to notice it, by making this claim, they are in effect conceding the importance of intelligence and the fact that it can be measured. So remove their claims that IQ does not vary between the races (which is not hard to prove), and the rest of their arguments fall apart. </p>
<p>The next time the libs scream that racial difference in IQ is pseudoscience, we should ask them what studies have proven this. They claim that racial differences in IQ have never been proven, but exactly when have they proven that all races are the same in IQ? Of course, the answer is &#8220;never.&#8221;</p>

		<p>#11 Anonymous, you made a good point.  They controlled for various SES factors but skipped the obvious step of measuring the parents&rsquo; IQs.</p>
<p>Most likely a junk food diet does have at least a moderately detrimental effect of IQ when all other factors are controlled for.  (It&rsquo;s hard to believe that a diet of Twinkies and Coca Cola could be good for the brain.)  But the same liberals who accept these studies refuse to accept the evidence of twin studies and adoption studies that provide excellent reasons to believe that IQ is highly heritable and differs on average across races.<br>

		<p>The same logic would find that naming children with certain names would result in a higher or lower IQ. It should be obvious that parental IQ affects the child&rsquo;s environment as well as the child&rsquo;s genes.</p>

		<p><i>Parents of the children were asked to fill out <b>questionnaires</b> that, among other things, detailed the kind of food and drink their children consumed.</i></p>
<p><br>
The diets in this study were <b>self-reported</b> by the parents - only dumb parents ADMIT to feeding their young kids lots of junk food.  Smart parents are more likely to avoid junk food, but they are also ashamed of the junk food that does wander into their diets.  Shame causes self-delusion as well as straight-up lying.</p>
<p>All of the highly educated Super Moms I know claim their kids eat organic blah-blah-blah and <i>NEVER</i> eat at McDonalds.  Most of these kids have all the latest Happy Meal Toys, of course, and Mom is mysteriously quiet about where they get them!  <br>

		<p>In the early 90&rsquo;s in the UK there was a spasm of optmism about<br>
nutrient supplements and sound diet being able to increase IQ<br>
across the board.  The research received premature &#8220;Ah&rsquo;s&#8221; and<br>
appears not to have replicated with enough promise to sustain further effort.  Yet, one wrinkle in the group comparisons of<br>
experimental and control, was the evident fact that only a few<br>
school age children had big spikes of several IQ points.  Anecdotal evidence seems too plebian for the scientists, and this may need to be revisited, inasmuch if the few &#8220;high responders&#8221; could be somehow identified or made less remote by narrowing a target population, then by most value systems, it is important to help the few that can be rather dramatically aided  It is a different direction, of course, to suggest that avoiding mega &#8220;doses&#8221; of salt and sugar might cease to depress IQ. But, here, too, maybe plain old ancecdotal &#8220;case studies&#8221; could be<br>
done on the sly  &mdash;  &#8220;I won&rsquo;t tell, if you won&rsquo;t tell&#8221; the Department Chairperson.    </p>

		<p>I think this is a classic case of confusing causation with correlation. Intelligent people are more likely to eat better and take better care of themselves. More dull-witted people are likely to succumb to a poorer diet.</p>
