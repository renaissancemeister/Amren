<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nation of Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan predicted on Sunday that America faces imminent uprisings that mirror those in the Middle East.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you are looking at in Tunisia, in Egypt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Libya, in Bahrain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what you see happening there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&rsquo;d better prepare because it will be coming to your door,&#8221; Farrakhan said in a booming voice, thousands of followers cheering in his wake.</p>
<p>Farrakhan also called on President Barack Obama to allow protesters to march, urging the president not to attack innocent people when they do.</p>

<p>On a humorous note, I can&rsquo;t wait to see how these nearly 100% white Wisconsin union protesters will meld with the &#8220;innocent&#8221; followers of Louis Farrakhan.  Hey, it&rsquo;s about rights, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>

		<p>I agree with Farrakhan about the unrest heading our way.However I can&rsquo;t figure out why his followers are cheering.Unlike the middle east Farrakhan&rsquo;s follows are in the minority.The unrest could be from white Christians who have been disenfranchise,marginalized, underemployed and over taxed.Farrakhan and his followers should not count their chickens before they are hatched.If the tea party really erupts into civil unrest I have a feeling Farrakhan will change his tune about calling &#8220;on President Barack Obama to allow protesters to march, urging the president not to attack innocent people when they do&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Farrakhan: Mideast Uprisings Will Come to US.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably going to be right on this one for the first time in his miserable life, but he&rsquo;s probably just picked up on what many analysts are saying.  He doesn&rsquo;t have sense enough to determine anything on his own.  He pretty much lost all credibility by relating his ongoing adventures about his spaceship that takes him on trips to the moon.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that at this point Farrakhan is wrong about an uprising by Blacks or Muslims in the United States. Blacks still love Obama by a wide margin and Muslims, though domineering and aggressive as ever, are still only a small percentage of the population. To really rebel and attack cops or tea party members or burn down neighborhoods would play right into our hands and the true paleo-conservative community could milk that for all we are worth. This is not 1968. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that if Obama loses in 2012, blacks may resort to violence and rioting. With the terrible Republican candidates, Obama would have to do some enormously bad, obviously anti-white, actions in order to lose against the cold fish or minorities the RNC will suicidally back. </p>
<p>The real destruction will come if Obama gets a second term-definite amnesty for illegals and reparations for slavery and whatever other nightmare scenarios we can devise.</p>

		<p>Louis Walcott was talking about his best buddy the Colonel and did not say one thing bad. Just said that he would not let a friend down or something similar.</p>
<p>The Bantu leaders, so called, in thissyhere country always have had an affection for dictators. Castro, Ghaddaffi, Arafat, Mugabe, etc. Just in love with despots. They crave to be despots and dictators themselves.</p>
<p>Maybe the disturbance will come, from an unexpected source? Who knows. Louis Walcott also praised L. Ron Hubbard for the efforts of L. Ron to &#8220;civilize&#8221; the Caucausian in thissyhere country. &#8220;We&#8221; need to learn to be civilized! Of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farrakhan also called on President Barack Obama to allow protesters to march&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And what exactly do Farrakahn and his ilk have to &#8220;protest&#8221; about? That the white genocide is not moving along fast enough?</p>

<p>Allow?  Not to attack innocent people?  What does Farrakhan think Obama is, a dictator?  He must not realize we have a First Amendment   &mdash;   IOW, we can &#8220;march&#8221; no matter the President, and even guilty people have rights to due process of the law.</p>

		<p>Minister Farrakhan is allowed to give a speech at an 18,000 seat arena?  His rhetoric seems far more incendiary than anything I&rsquo;ve ever read from Jared Taylor.  <br>

Didn&rsquo;t Minister Farrakhan once claim white people had been invented by a mad scientist?<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Farrakhan(vict) I am more prepared than you know.  And I bet I can say the same for most white conservatives in the U.S.  I would love to see a black uprising against 50,000,000+ racially conscience individuals armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>Farrakhan also called on President Barack Obama to allow protesters to march, urging the president not to attack innocent people when they do.</p>
<p>I am not an Obama fan, but I will give him credit that he will not have protesters attacked, this is still kind of America.  So don&rsquo;t use that excuse Louis; ready when you are.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the USA. But I think these demonstrations and the accompanying anarchy could very easily spread first to European countries, which have (very foolishly) built up such large Islamic minorities by now.  And then, to the UsA and Canada. Canada will cave in  and grovel to them without a whimper. The US will be a tougher nut to crack. It could get very nasty here.</p>
<p>In short, I fear that the riots are not going to stop on the South side of the Mediterranean.  This could be a very hot summer in Paris, London, and Amsterdam! This example could be the spark that Europe&rsquo;s Moslems are waiting for to make their bid for power.  </p>
<p>No matter. Whenever it comes, it&rsquo;s really just a matter of time. It&rsquo;s inevitable. The steam has been building up for too long.</p>

		<p>Something which Farrakhan might not understand is that real muslims in Europe and in the Middle East, regard black Islam as an affront, a false offshoot that has nothing to do with the real religion.</p>
<p>Remember, before Malcolm X made the Hajj pilgrimage, he was a student of the NOI school. After he went to the Middle East, he repudiated the ways of Elijah Muhammad. Everyone knows what happened next.</p>
<p>On the subject of Malcolm&rsquo;s murder, Farrakahan is on record as declaring ambigously that &#8220;The white man takes care of his traitors. The Jew takes care of his. We will take care of ours.&#8221; John Henrik is on record as saying that Farrakhan killed Malcolm. Former members of the Nation allege that Farrakhan bragged about it in private.</p>
<p>This pseudo Church cult is essentially scientology for angry black people.</p>

    Louie doesn&rsquo;t understand, his little cult group is very small. If he tries to start an uprising, and louie is crazy enough to try, the Mexicans will beat the stuffing out of them. Then the whites with accurrate gunfire will finish of what is left.<br>

		<p>During the late 1960s and early 1970s many on the left in the United States had fantasies of something like the Russian Revolution happening in the United States. Now Louis Farrakhan has fantasies of something like the revolutions in Egypt and Libya. <br>
 <br>
I thought during the late 1960s and early 1970s and I think now that the closest thing we will get to a &#8220;revolution&#8221; in the United States is something like the Spanish Civil War, or perhaps the American Civil War with the South winning. The left will be annihilated. The result will be either an American form of fascism, a reversion to laissez faire capitalism and Jim Crow legislation, or perhaps the division of the United States.   <br>
 <br>
As long as most lower income whites feel more identity with the white plutocracy than with non whites, the left dream of a revolution will be a nightmare.  </p>

		<p>I think Farrakan is right.  Once you cut off all the handouts, you&rsquo;re going to see a violent reaction from those elements of society that are least capable of controlling impulse.  This country is running out of money.  What we are seeing these days in Wisconsin, is pretty much a White reaction to loosing ground in the basic standards of living they have come to take for granted.  We seen in the sixties how Blacks react.  We&rsquo;ve seen it again since then during the Rodney King riots.  It isn&rsquo;t going to be pretty. </p>

responsible for what might occur should his demands not be met by whatever city he chose to threaten on a particular day.<br>
Al Sharpton never suffered any consequences from what his oratory brought about in this incident in Harlem.</p>

		<p>Bring it, Louis!  I wonder, though, where will the food, electricity, natural gas, diesel and gasoline, and treated, potable water on which his inner-city malcontents depend come from once they&rsquo;re at war with the surrounding suburbs?  Also, white it&rsquo;s not much of a challenge holding up a liquor store with a 9mm pistol or sawed-off shotgun, using those to fight against people who have centerfire rifles is likely to be less than successful.</p>
<p>I think the anarchy will spread to Europe - and the US.  I have long suspected - since reading Tom Chittum&rsquo;s book in 1998 that he didn&rsquo;t go far enough with &#8220;Civil War Two&#8221;; a wave of revolutions much like those in Europe of 1848 will occur.  Most tellingly, the revolution in Austria that year centered on national disintegration, with Hungary secceeding from the empire; it was only reconquered by Austria via a conventional invasion involving direct military assistance from Russia.</p>
<p>Rope, ammo, canned food, rice and dried noodles seem like good investments right about now.  Five-gallon water cans which could be filled - with a little bleach added - in case of service interruptions in the suburbs also sound good.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t be the &#8220;tea party&#8221; that erupts into civil unrest.  It will be the dependent classes when their white-funded entitlements are cut off.   The unrest will start in California and move East. It is as inevitable as the sun rising as states go broke and inflation sets in, which is already happening, exactly as planned.  I&rsquo;m sure the elites that run our government have already moved their money out of the country and will flee when the food and gas riots start.</p>
<p>The unrest will be violent and unremitting.  If the Feds fire on anyone, it will be white Americans.</p>

		<p>It will be the latinos in at least 20 states who will rise up and &#8216;reclaim&rsquo; what is &#8216;theirs.&rsquo;  It might take about 20 years, but that&rsquo;s where the danger is coming from.  People who focus on the moslems all the time make me laugh.  There&rsquo;s less than 2 million of  them here, but in 20 years we&rsquo;ll have 100 million latinos - young, uneducated mostly, gangbangers and followers of marxist ideology.</p>
