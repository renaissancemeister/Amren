<p>Funny, my calendar doesn&rsquo;t indicate this as Social Justice Week.  Can&rsquo;t the Social Justicers do better than a week within what is supposed to be the Sacred and Holy Observation of Black History Month?</p>

		<p>It seems to me that only 1 side of racism is being explored here so it is an incomplete study.  Unless it was designed specifically to be a hit piece directed only at whites.  <br>

		<p>Well&hellip;what&rsquo;s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander&hellip; </p>
<p>Our side has an inalienable right to protest too.  Sadly, protest from the right is jackbooted, usually.  </p>
<p>The collectivists&rsquo; free speech is branded noble and means &#8220;speaking truth to power&#8221; or some such bumper sticker twaddle.  Our free speech is branded racist and is a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221;  Really they mean &#8220;thought crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hope she gets some good questions   &mdash;   it would be interesting to see how the speaker would react should she be challenged to back up her looney positions with logic and facts.</p>
<p>The left cannot abide any disagreement, so easily do their shibboleths crumble. </p>

		<p>I looked up Ms. Daniels website and was quite interested in &#8220;cloaked websites&#8221; that she claims are &#8220;pernicious to young and old&#8221; and was thoroughly underwhelmed, imagine that.  In all of her important research she lists a total of 3 sites, two of which are obviously satire.  She looks to be nothing more than a typical angry lesbian who hates normal white society while taking advantage of everything that a white society provides.  Really too bad she and others of her ilk weren&rsquo;t born under the Iron Curtain which they all favored.  </p>

		<p>What a bunch of useless academic twaddle. Worthless information couched in academic jargon and sold to naive 20 year olds as sophisticated research. Every time I read nonsense like this I&rsquo;m glad I found another profession. <br>
&#8220;she examines racially constructed ideas of masculinity and racially segregated urban spaces can be protective of, or harmful to, health.&#8221; Indeed. </p>

		<p>From what I have researched, Daniel&rsquo;s book is required reading in many college &#8220;social science&#8221; courses across the country. Apparently all dishonesty in America is perpetrated by Whites and all Whites are White supremacists. It&rsquo;s author intends to make sure that free speech ceases to be part of the internet and that black truth will reign supreme. Students who wrote reviews on this book said that it was &#8220;eye-opening,&#8221; -  a comment probably not made by black students who have always known that Whitey was lying just to oppress them. The evil Whites are discovering the errors of their ways, and you can bet that the majority who attend this will be White. </p>

		<p>Well, the double standard is glaring.  Any white on nonwhite crime is, at the very least, cause for keen suspicion as to whether or not the crime was racially motivated.  Whereas it&rsquo;s scarcely possible for a nonwhite to commit a hate crime.   A black person practically has to be yelling &#8220;death to whitey&#8221; and wearing a Black Panther T-shirt while committing an interracial crime to invoke the same degree of suspicion which any white perpetrator of a crime upon a nonwhite would. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The result is a first-rate analysis of the emerging social phenomenon of cyber racism within the global information age&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;first rate analysis&#8221; is aimed only at whites.  Daniels doesn&rsquo;t go into Chinese chat rooms, Pakistani cyber cafes, Arabic social sites or any of the non-English speaking areas of the internet. She doesn&rsquo;t even go after strident black nationalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only whites can be racist&#8221; is the illogic which exposes the rabid anti-white liberal. </p>

<p>I hope she is challenged a bit or given some good questions. It&rsquo;s been my observation, though, that if challenged on campus, the end result is that it just forces them to be better racists. Some of the obvious double-speak is eliminated, corrected or hidden from view. Some of the diversity edicts and double-standards are so ridiculous because they never are challenged, I think.   <br>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there so I can&rsquo;t speak up. But if you have insights, don&rsquo;t be afraid to say them (be polite of course). This HAVE to change. One way is when people like you start speaking out displaying a different point of view. </p>
<p>If it is well reasoned, you will get others to question the movement. </p>
<p>That how social change, like the push multiculturalism. It begins with people like you  &mdash;  like us.</p>
<p>People didn&rsquo;t the status quo of homogeneous society and believed that a given society could progress due to diverse people, etc. This has taken its course and needs to swing the other way. It is like pendulum swing that goes left and right.</p>
