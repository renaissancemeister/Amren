			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Deacon, Telegraph (London), February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Racism, I&rsquo;m sure most of us agree, is bad. But we have a problem: we don&rsquo;t all agree about what it is. The jokes that Top Gear&rsquo;s presenters made about &#8220;lazy&#8221; Mexicans are apparently thought racist  &mdash;  at any rate, the BBC apologised to Mexico&rsquo;s ambassador, and Steve Coogan wrote a newspaper article calling the jokes &#8220;casual racism&#8221;. (Not that this has made the Top Gear presenters think twice  &mdash;  on Sunday they joked that Albanians were thieves.) Meanwhile, an independent health watchdog has had its funding withdrawn after its chairman described gossip as &#8220;jungle drums&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how much, and how quickly, our notions of what constitutes racism have changed. Take this example. In the September 1994 issue of Loaded magazine, Damon Albarn from Blur was asked what sort of women he found attractive. His answer included the declaration: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t like Orientals at all. Well, I like them, but I never fancy them.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was one of the leading pop stars of the time, interviewed in one of the leading magazines of the time  &mdash;  yet the quote was unchallenged. It didn&rsquo;t make the news. Nobody called Albarn racist (and he plainly isn&rsquo;t: he&rsquo;s made records with musicians from all over the world).</p>
<p>Imagine the outcry if a leading pop star today, not 20 years later, were to say he found a particular race unattractive. &#8220;Asian girls aren&rsquo;t pretty,&#8221; for instance, or &#8220;Afro-Caribbeans don&rsquo;t turn me on.&#8221; Come to that, referring to people from the Far East as &#8220;Orientals&#8221;, as Albarn did in 1994, would probably now cause some degree of scandal.</p>
<p>Another comparison. At Christmas, thousands complained that BBC One&rsquo;s comedy series Come Fly With Me, which featured two white British actors (Matt Lucas and David Walliams) playing various daft foreign characters, was racist. I don&rsquo;t remember thousands calling it racist when, in 1997, a white British actor created a comedy character named Tony Ferrino, a sleazy, slow-witted Portuguese singer weeth a seelly accent like thees. The comedian, incidentally, was Steve Coogan.</p>
<p>Then again, there are still times when it seems to be fine to talk witheringly about a race. Yesterday, a Left-wing national newspaper ran an article about a band called The Vaccines. Its headline: &#8220;Sick of dull white-boy indie rock? The Vaccines have the cure.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder whether the same newspaper would run an article asking if we were sick of &#8220;black-boy hip hop&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Matt Lucas and David Walliams last series was called &#8220;little Britain. The show basically made fun of white working class characters. No one complained. Yet in their new series they add a few ethnics and all hell breaks loose. Why the double standard?.</p>

		<p>Now that you mention it, I AM sick of &#8220;black boy hip hop.&#8221;  I am also sick of singers attempting to &#8220;ornament&#8221; their melody lines in the style of black singers; perhaps if Cristina Aguilera had paid more attention to the lyrics instead of to her efforts at her vast over-ornamentation of the Star Spangled Banner melody, she might not have screwed up the words.  This &#8220;blackification&#8221; of all things in socalled art, be it music, painting, sculpture, dance, or whatever   &mdash;   is appalling.  It has its place - but other styles also have theirs, and since this is NOT a black nation, the black style does NOT belong at the top in this country.</p>

		<p>Yes, you can be racist against any colour, so long as it&rsquo;s white. I&rsquo;ll add that you can be biased against any religion so long as they&rsquo;re either Christianity or Judaism. You can verbally trash heterosexuals to your heart&rsquo;s content, but never gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals. Able-bodied white guys are great to poke fun at, but never consider snickering at persons with any type of handicap. And if you trash white people, remember, to ensure no fingers are pointed at you, your victim has to be a white, heterosexual, non-welfare dependent, physically and mentally fit, male.</p>
<p>The ideal target of society&rsquo;s biases is the epitome of the human beings who developed modern science, produced great works of art and literature, made space travel a reality, improved human health enormously, and made modern civilization possible. Should we be grateful? Never! But scoff? Absolutely!<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s like the old parable of putting a frog in water and then turning up the heat in notches. It doesn&rsquo;t notice, whereas if you were to put it into hot water it would jump out immediately. </p>
<p>The PC era began in earnest with the old &#8220;judge a man by the content of his character, not the color of his skin,&#8221; then it was ramped up to &#8220;give the &#8216;downtrodden&rsquo; special preferences,&#8221; and finally it&rsquo;s proceeded to chipping away at free speech rights until honest talk is no longer permitted, and that&rsquo;s where we are now. </p>

		<p>Time Travel.  I&rsquo;m certain now, it&rsquo;s the only answer.</p>
<p>If whites abandon all the &#8216;superior&rsquo; races, within 50 years there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything left and we could recolonize.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave a Terminator behind while we&rsquo;re at it.  Give him black skin and a Latino name and he could kill millions without ever being convicted.</p>
<p>Having seen every &#8216;Top Gear&rsquo; episode I can get my hands on, I can tell you that they are very much an even handed bunch of rolling-eye jokesters and that&rsquo;s the tragedy.  They deliberately overplay everything from the expression on their faces to the specific enunciation of their humor to -make sure- that nobody thinks the criticisms are real.</p>
<p>Which of course, sabotages the truth upon which the ethnic stereotypes are mostly founded.</p>

<p>This has happened!  There was a massive media outcry against musician John Mayer when he stated he didn&rsquo;t find Black Women attractive in a recent Playboy interview.</p>
<p><i>&#8216;Sick of dull white-boy indie rock?&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>No.  Indie/ Alternative Rock is an implicitly White Art form so many White Advocates like it.  Some of it is even explicitly pro-White such as Morrisseys &#8216;National Front Disco&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Rap on the other hand is the new Disco and has for a long time been deserving of a similar fate, to die off in popularity and become something of a joke. <br>

Lazy Mexicans is a relative tern. After all, they did make the effort to cross the border illegally and then make their way to the social services office. What they do after that is anyones guess.</p>

		<p>NPR recently said the use of the term &#8220;gringo&#8221; was acceptable for &#8220;diverse views&#8221;, while shortly afterward the BBC program called Top Gear got in trouble for joking about Mexicans, and there are countless example of this double think all the time against whites ad nauseam.</p>
<p>The example of 2+2=5 demonstrates this point, when something is so terribly wrong yet relentlessly enforced by the power structure of society on all levels, than it is not only the right but the duty to expose and resist it.</p>

<p> Just a slight augmentation here.  I know a white male who has not been able to find work, largely due to his over-education, experience, but really because he is white.  He is now become disabled and has been denied SSI or any sort of welfare.  An immigrant, working at the DSHS processed his denial and told him in a thick accent of his rejection.  His wife&rsquo;s part time job is inadequate. They will likely loose their home this year because it is a choice between eating and retaining their house.  They will have to rent an apartment and increase the probability of victims of crime.  So as whites, especially men, grow older, they will not be able to find jobs, their meager SSA benefits will hardly even get them shelter.  This is how many of us are being funneled into extinction.  The squeeze has begun for many whites, even if many posters here do not feel it yet.</p>

		<p>The first comment asks &#8220;Why the double standard?&#8221;  What you must realize, and what must be made clear to as many whites as possible:  There is no double standard in any of this &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; activity.  <br>
It is a single standard.  It is anti-white.  </p>

		<p>I am glad to see a mainstream British newspaper challenging political correctness like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine the outcry if a leading pop star today, not 20 years later, were to say he found a particular race unattractive. &#8216;Asian girls aren&rsquo;t pretty,&rsquo; for instance, or &#8216;Afro-Caribbeans don&rsquo;t turn me on.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>A very good point.  In fact, as poster #6 noted above, there was a famous musician who said, just a few months ago, something about how his organ was a racist because he didn&rsquo;t like black girls, and got a lot of heat for that.  Although I&rsquo;m not so sure about the article&rsquo;s claim that the term &#8220;Oriental&#8221; has become offensive since the 90&rsquo;s.  It seems to me that people don&rsquo;t use it today simply because it sounds antiquated, but not necesarrily offensive.  Though there are some liberals who get offended by the term (such as my German aunt-in-law), I don&rsquo;t think it is considered offensive by most people, just very old-fashioned.</p>
