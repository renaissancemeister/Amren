<h1><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-02-african-american-women-vulnerable-media-driven-body.html">African-American Women Less Vulnerable to Media-Driven Body Dissatisfaction</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Physorg.com, February 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, with the start of National Eating Disorders Awareness Week today, a University of Florida researcher points to a study showing that African-American women are less susceptible to media-driven body dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>While previous studies have shown the negative influence of thinner-than-average models on body image, the UF study by exercise psychologist Heather Hausenblas shows that race can have a moderating effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re bombarded with media images of what&rsquo;s considered ideal. We wanted to measure the influence of race on how that makes women feel about their bodies,&#8221; said Hausenblas, who co-authored the research with doctoral student Ninoska DeBraganza. &#8220;We know that African-American women report less body dissatisfaction overall than Caucasian women, who are the most affected of all ethnicities. But to my knowledge, no study on media influence had ever taken the ethnicity of the models into account.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the study, published in the March 2010 issue of the Journal of Black Studies, Hausenblas showed two sets of photographs to 31 Caucasian and 30 African-American undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Both sets of slides showed images of white female models from magazines and catalogs. One set represented the slender &#8220;media ideal,&#8221; while the other models&rsquo; figures were more representative of average build. After viewing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; slides, white women reported more body dissatisfaction than they had felt before viewing them. After white women viewed the &#8220;average&#8221; models, however, they felt better about their bodies. African-American women, in contrast, reported no change in their body satisfaction after viewing either set of slides.</p>
<p>The study used Caucasian models to reflect the majority of images in magazines and catalogs. The resulting impact on the white women&rsquo;s body dissatisfaction may suggest that they were more inclined to compare themselves to the models than the African-American women were, Hausenblas said.</p>
<p>Kevin Thompson, a psychology professor at the University of South Florida, said the study poses some intriguing questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This innovative investigation suggests that one reason that African-American women have lower rates of body dissatisfaction is that they don&rsquo;t compare themselves to Caucasian models or use them as a reference point for determining how they feel about their appearance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If comparisons with same-ethnicity models are provided, African-American women might be affected in the same manner as Caucasian women. Or, if they continue to be unaffected, then it would be even more fascinating, suggesting a general strategy among African-American women of resisting the negative influences of unrealistic images of attractiveness as perpetuated by the media.&#8221;</p>

		<p>They are built differently and it is true, the brothers like their women just &#8220;different&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to look like a whitey fashion model if you can&rsquo;t be and most of all because the brothers just don&rsquo;t likes dems&rsquo; stuff.</p>

Yet another PC myth/lie proven wrong. </p>
<p>Black behavior isn&rsquo;t driven by media images. Media images of blacks are driven by blacks themselves. That&rsquo;s why we always see the overweight &#8216;mammy&rsquo; character in most films today. The &#8216;stereotype&rsquo; is based on reality.</p>

		<p>This does not suprise me.  Black women think they look hot no matter how fat, sloppy, or outlandish they appear to be.  I&rsquo;ve noticed the same with Hispanic women too.  It&rsquo;s as if they don&rsquo;t own a mirror  &mdash;  -or use it.</p>

		<p>A drive through the Black part of town is all you need to confirm the veracity of that study. It would appear that the sisters are more interested in KFC than they are in looking like a binge and purge runway queen.</p>
<p>Very soon we will be treated to the sight of 300 pound ebony princesses wearing those stretchy Pajama Jeans that they&rsquo;ve been advertising all over the commercial TV stations. It&rsquo;s going to be great.</p>

		<p>To look slim and trim takes effort, something blacks aren&rsquo;t known for. Then there&rsquo;s the small point that they just aren&rsquo;t attractive to the eye.</p>
<p>Recently, in the NY Post, they&rsquo;ve been putting a bunch of models pictures in the paper, and the black ones are hideous. Yes, they are thin, but it&rsquo;s very obvious that they&rsquo;re only pictured because the paper knows if they didn&rsquo;t put them in the paper, there&rsquo;d be beefing no end.</p>

		<p>So basically the test failed to test anything useful, probably because the researchers presumed that race didn&rsquo;t exist or matter. Then in the last paragraph the researcher offers a gee-whiz what-if scenario, which he did not actually test, that might demonstrate some noble resiliency and immunity to manipulation among blacks. In other words, he&rsquo;s fantasizing.</p>

		<p>Trying to look like models has lead girls (and boys now) into anorexia, bulimia, and a whole host of other unhealthy habits. It would not leave me hurt at all if modeling as an industry disappeared tomorrow.</p>

		<p>What does it matter if a black girl is thin or fat?  They can still find dozens of black men willing to sleep with them at any point, and they announce this willingness, often in crude ways, a nearly every turn. That is a pretty good boost to the ego, even if doesn&rsquo;t get them a husband. Getting married, and getting a decent husband, that is a different matter, but large numbers of black women know that is beyond the capabilities of a lot of black men to begin with. They don&rsquo;t expect to be married. They expect to be able to live off of aid for years, maybe randomly collecting child support, get a free ride to school, and then get AA government jobs to support them when that runs out. Maybe they will meet someone then who will be saddled with their 2-4 out of wedlock children that is willing to shack up, maybe even willing to marry.</p>

<p>Remember that blacks tend to lack foresight, plus they have issues with impulse control.  So they just do what feels good to them and don&rsquo;t bother to think about long-term consequences.</p>
