			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), Feb. 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Four men launched a horrific attack on a teacher in which they slashed his face and left him with a fractured skull because they did not approve of him teaching religion to Muslim girls.</p>
<p>Akmol Hussein, 26, Sheikh Rashid, 27, Azad Hussain, 25, and Simon Alam, 19, attacked Gary Smith with a Stanley knife, an iron rod and a block of cement.</p>
<p>Mr Smith, who is head of religious education at Central Foundation Girls&rsquo; School in Bow, east London, also suffered a fractured skull. </p>
<p>The four now face a jail sentence.</p>
<p>Detectives made secret recordings of the gang&rsquo;s plot to attack Mr Smith prior to the brutal assault.</p>
<p>The covert audio probe captured the gang condemning Mr Smith for &#8216;teaching other religions to our sisters&rsquo;, the court heard.</p>
<p>The RE teacher was targeted as he made his way on foot along Burdett Road in nearby Mile End on July 12 last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse told the court: &#8216;The evidence from what was said on the probe points overwhelmingly to a religious motive for this attack.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>It is believed the gang had made two earlier attempts to get at the teacher.</p>
<p>They were due to stand trial for the attack at Snaresbrook Crown Court but pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent.</p>
<p>Central Foundation Girls&rsquo; School in Bow, east London, where Gary Smith was a religious education teacher</p>
<p>A fifth defendant, Badruzzuha Uddin, 23, admitted assisting the thugs by hiding blood-stained clothing.</p>
<p>Judge John Hand QC remanded the defendants in custody until sentence on a date yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Hussein, of Bethnal Green, east London; Rashid, of Shadwell, east London; Hussain, of Wapping, east London, and Alam, of Whitechapel, east London; have all admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.</p>
<p>Uddin, of Shadwell, admitted assisting an offender.</p>

I see that our Limey guardians of the mother tongue have lost their way with language too. Hussein, Rashid, Hussain, and Alam are no more &#8220;of&#8221; these English neighborhoods than Ingmar Guandique is &#8220;of&#8221; Maryland.</p>

		<p>The police were aware of the impending assault and yet let it happen? Seeing as they were secretly bugging this gang already they must have been onto them for a while. It&rsquo;s really hard for me grasp the reality of Britain having imported totally alien third worlders into their midst, and in such numbers. They&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where they seem to feel pretty comfortable attacking the British in their own country, almost daring them to do anything about it. </p>

<p>Ah, yes.  Diversity.  It&rsquo;s more important to UK white elitist dregs than anything on earth and I have no doubt they&rsquo;re ready to persecute or murder anybody who tries to stop their efforts to create a rainbow society.</p>
<p>But, there&rsquo;s just one problem.  Their schemes just might be interrupted by a spread of muslim discontent from the Middle East to their ghettos of jihadists, and the chaos will soon be all around them.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a better bunch.</p>

<p>Wait what?  And they did&rsquo;t intervene, why?</p>
<p>I guess their case is stronger AFTER the brutal assault was already committed, but I imagine that this poor teacher would have been happier without the ass-whooping.</p>

		<p>You people are all racist. Mr. Smith is guilty of assault on the Muslim culture. He is to be arrested and convicted of that and handed over to the local Imam for punishment. The ancient white aggression against peaceful People of Color must end now. Britain is racist for arresting these innocent men.</p>

		<p>It can truly be said now that &#8220;the sun has set on the British Empire.&#8221; Never thought the people who were so brave and withstood the enemy in WW11, would give in to the evils of Islam. We must remember, this practice is not only a religion. It is their law, their culture and rules the actions of all &#8220;good&#8221; Muslims.</p>

<p>Well you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be with evil racist now would you? My suggestion is to move out of Europe back to the Middle East. Funny &#8220;white aggression&#8221; always seem to happen on white land.</p>
<p>Hint:words like &#8220;racist&#8221; don&rsquo;t have any effect on me. Try again.<br>

		<p>Except where crimes against political correctness and its clients are concerned, including thought-crimes, the British police are now a purely reactive, after-the-event &#8220;police service&#8221; (when they can be prised away from their paperwork-loaded desks), not a proactive, street-patrolling, crime-preventing police force.</p>
<p>In the light of this, OF COURSE they didn&rsquo;t forewarn Mr Smith.</p>

		<p>At Poster #14 (Ben) - I think Poster #12 was being sarcastic.  No-one could say something that stupid and be serious about it.  He was just miming a hyperbolic version of how a far-leftist might react if they read these comments.</p>

<p>Bingo. Except that it is not hyperbolic, since I&rsquo;ve run across white people who actually think this way.</p>

<p>Imagine if this had been one of the (nigh nonexistent) skinhead gangs, or a group of &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;, talking about killing a muslim for indoctrinating British children in Islam. Even if the remarks had indicated no intention to actually go through with the crime, they would probably have been locked up immediately under the Race Relations Act. But if the intended victim is a white man, apparently the police have to wait until the attack actually occurs to do anything about it. What happened to the Britons who would never be slaves, who fearlessly fought off any invasion, who built a world-spanning empire, and who gave birth to several (at least formerly) great nations? </p>
<p>Who are these weaklings that now cringe and grovel before barbarous cultures and peoples, who preach the joys of &#8220;diversity&#8221; even as it chokes out the native people of their land, who pay tribute (in the form of taxpayer-funded welfare benefits) to their new rulers, and who take legal action against any one of their own people who dares to say that this arrangement is anything other than wonderful? They can&rsquo;t possibly be of the same stock as the Britons I remember from the histories.</p>
