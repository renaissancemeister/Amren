<h1>Jailhouse Phone Calls Are Released</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed Meyer, Akron Beacon Journal, February 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Summit County Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office has released hours of recorded jailhouse phone conversations between KelleyWilliams-Bolar and her family after she was sentenced last month in the Copley-Fairlawn school residency case.</p>
<p>The calls  &mdash;  37 covering nearly nine hours of recordings on a CD  &mdash;  were obtained by the Akron Beacon Journal Thursday afternoon following a public records request.</p>
<p>In one of the calls, Williams-Bolar and her father, Edward Williams, talk about their saga becoming a movie or a book.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He prefaces his remarks by telling his daughter that she is going to make &#8220;more money than you ever made at school or in your life  &mdash;  a movie or a book!&#8221;</p>
<p>In other calls, they also discuss the Rev. Al Sharpton becoming involved in the case, as well as overtures from Oprah Winfrey and the Good Morning America show. Sharpton has announced that he plans to travel to Akron next week to discuss the case.</p>
<p>Williams-Bolar, 40, spent nine days in jail last month after a Summit County jury convicted her of two felony counts of tampering with records to keep her two children enrolled in Copley-Fairlawn schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williams-Bolar, a single mother who is a teaching assistant at Buchtel High School, testified at her trial that she wanted her two girls to go to Copley-Fairlawn schools so they would not be alone at her Akron home while she was at work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She also raised that issue in the recorded jailhouse calls, telling a family friend at one point: &#8220;If there&rsquo;s anything I have to say, it would be from the perspective that I&rsquo;m a family provider. I provide for my family as much as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In charges unrelated to the school residency case, Edward Williams, 64, faces one count of grand theft and one count of tampering with records over allegations of fraud to obtain various benefits from county and state agencies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The grand theft indictment of Edward Williams contains allegations that he &#8220;knowingly obtained&#8221; $36,023.87 from the Ohio Department of Human Services and the Department of Job and Family Services &#8220;by deception.&#8221;</p>
