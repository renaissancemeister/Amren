<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> &#8220;I love the president like most of us. I just want the president to do better,&#8221; Diddy told The Source. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a difference between us voting for somebody and us believing in somebody. He&rsquo;s the person that we believed in so I pray night and day that [Obama] understands how God ordained his presidency. I feel there was a promise made to God to look after people that was less fortunate, and [many] of those people are African-American .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Diddy also campaigned for Obama along with other African American celebrities like Oprah and Jay-Z. Their work, along with Obama&rsquo;s speeches and aides, {snip} all played a part in getting voters out to the polls. {snip}<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>When it comes to Obama making 2012-influenced decisions, Diddy started talking sense, saying, &#8220;It&rsquo;s something he might not get reelected for, but we elected him. He owes us. I&rsquo;d rather have a black president that was man enough to say that he was doing something for black people have one term than a president who played the politics game have two terms.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you feel that way, then back it up   &mdash;   Don&rsquo;t vote for Obama in 2012.</p>
<p>True, Diddy, if you&rsquo;re being a spokesman for all black voters, you collectively might have &#8220;elected him,&#8221; but you didn&rsquo;t elect him.  In other words, virtually all black voters in 2008 punched a space on a touch screen or filled in an oval on a card next to the name &#8220;Barack Obama,&#8221; but that&rsquo;s not the same as getting him elected, or being the crucial marginal/swing demographic that put him over the top.</p>
<p>Blacks would have voted for any Democrat.  Maybe the fact that Obama is (half) black drove the black turnout a little higher, but a percentage more of a voter demo that is circa 7-8% of the electorate doesn&rsquo;t amount to a hill of beans.  Younger whites turned out in bigger numbers for Obama, but that&rsquo;s not much higher of a hill of beans.  I contend the swing demographic in 2008 for Obama was working middle class whites.  And, as little as Diddy thinks Obama has done for blacks, he&rsquo;s done even less for working middle class whites, other than make two-faced sleight-of-hand pseudo-promises.</p>

		<p>Black complaints about a politician&hellip;black or white&hellip;. not doing enough for blacks means that the person targeted is not unfairly giving them privileges, assets and money.</p>
<p>Their idea of equality is being more equal than anyone else.  Too, they expect to have as many professionals as other groups,  but the want these positions given to them also.  It&rsquo;s common knowledge they can&rsquo;t earn anything&hellip;.materially or academically&hellip;on their own.</p>
<p>This Van Jones, even as a brilliant Yale grad, is about as dumb as any black on the scene.  He&rsquo;s living proof of the worthlessness of an AA certification.</p>
<p>&#8220;We gonna change the system,&#8221; he shouts.  Is it common for brilliant grads to talk like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really as simple as that.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. I came up on the poor end of the middle class. My parents both worked very hard to keep a roof over our heads and would always deny any governmental assistance even though they qualified. </p>
<p>I have managed to become a success in my later years. I live a life I never dreamed I could have and I did it 100% by my own sweat and never took a hand-out. I never once expected that things should just be easy for me because my President was ever at any one time the same color as me.<br>

		<p>Heh.  No &#8220;Diddy&#8221;, black people didn&rsquo;t get Obama elected.  White liberals did, period.  I can&rsquo;t believe people still think that blacks are some huge voting bloc to be pandered to.  </p>

		<p>What are you going to do Diddy My Man? Not vote for Obama?<br>
Of course you will vote for him..if he turns the USA<br>
into another Afro-Marxist hell hole you could care less.<br>
Obama preserves the whitey oppression theme..without which<br>
you would have to face the stark light of the truth. </p>

		<p>Simple minded Diddy doesnt realize Obuma is just a puppet. He was elected by White liberals and people who were just so disgusted with Bush. Right place right time(for him). </p>
<p>Black people act now as if all there problems are solved now because they have a black president. They think that everything will go their way now and Obuma will just give them free things, jobs and power. They think that white people are successful because they have &#8220;power&#8221;. Come 2012, and blacks are still stuck in the same place waiting for handout still then maybe they will realize, maybe&hellip;. </p>

		<p>You have got to love the audacity of a guy like this DIDDY as he calls himself ( This Week ) In the first place it wasn&rsquo;t black folks as he likes to call them that elected Obama even if every black in America voted for him that would be less than 10% of the vote. NO it was the Liberal College Kid who thinks everything is FREE and the world owes him a living. It was the 98% white audience of people like Oprah who wanted everyone to know how Open Minded and Non Racist they were, not blacks as Mr. Diddy says.</p>
<p>Believe it or not I still hear White Retired 60 - 80 year old white people talk about all Obama is doing for them, whereas they should be more aware of what he is doing to them..</p>
<p>AS A SIDE NOTE:</p>
<p>Mr. Diddy just bought his 17 year old son a second Maybach Automobile ( $300,000 to $500,00 Price Range)  and he said well this second one is a limo and the boy might need it to go to the prom. Honest that is what he said..</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the same philosophy blacks have had forever, and that (according to them) whites must abide by: you must give blacks twice as much as whites so that there is clearly ample evidence that you are not giving blacks less. Anything less than that is lawsuit territory.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s diddy and the kiddy, on the occasion of his getting his first six-figure car as a privilege of him standing on Earth for yet another full revolution.  Notice that young Mr. Combs is considerably lighter skinned than his father.  It makes you wonder if &#8220;babymomma&#8221; is white, but I looked it up, and she (Misa Hylton-Brim) was not - her own father was black and mother was half Jamaican and half Japanese.</p>
<p>If she was white, we all would have been ready to point out Diddy&rsquo;s obvious hypocrisy.</p>
<p>As an aside, I am not an advocate of giving your children cars as presents.  Especially not a six figure bling machine like this one, or rather, these two.  My reasons are too complicated, and they&rsquo;d be way OT here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s their own fault they are less fortunate than others, however you define that.  Then again, if P. Diddy really feels so bad about &#8216;struggling black folks&rsquo; then he can support them with his rap money.</p>
<p><b>Diddy also campaigned for Obama along with other African American celebrities like Oprah and Jay-Z. Their work, along with Obama&rsquo;s speeches and aides, {snip} all played a part in getting voters out to the polls. </b></p>
<p>Wait.  You mean blacks were rallying around a black man simple because he was black?  Sounds &#8216;racist&rsquo; to me!</p>
<p><b>When it comes to Obama making 2012-influenced decisions, Diddy started talking sense, saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something he might not get reelected for, but we elected him. He owes us.

<p>Oh, you can be sure he&rsquo;s not going to get back in, Puff Daddy. You can be damn sure of that.  For any blacks reading this: if you want a black president and a country and government to call home, move to Africa and don&rsquo;t come back.  Otherwise, if you&rsquo;re in a white country, follow our rules and behave yourself or leave.  It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the % of black voters in 2008 was.  I think 92-95?  2012 will be more of the same no matter how much blacks say obama has not done for them&hellip;.</p>
