			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A schoolboy has been reprimanded for alleged racism after he called a white pupil named Brown a &#8216;chocolate brownie&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Harrison Wiener, 10, made the comment after being teased about his own surname at Thorp Primary School in Royton, Oldham.</p>
<p>Harrison&rsquo;s mother is now furious after her son was disciplined by teachers and ordered to apologise.</p>
<p>Race row: Thorp Primary School disciplined Harrison Wiener after he called a fellow pupil  &mdash;  who was white  &mdash;  &#8216;chocolate brownie&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harrison had been called &#8216;sausage boy&rsquo; by a classmate making fun of his Austrian-derived surname, which is also an American word used for hot dog sausages.</p>
<p>The child is said to have retorted &#8216;Shut up, chocolate brownie&rsquo; only to be punished for making an apparent racist remark. </p>
<p>Mother-of-two Clare Wiener has been told the incident is to be &#8216;noted&rsquo; in her son&rsquo;s file and reported to the Lancashire school&rsquo;s local education authority.</p>
<p>&#8216;Harrison has been left really upset by this and made to feel like he&rsquo;s done something terrible,&rsquo; she told The Sun.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s crazy. One boy taunted him by making his surname sound like a snack  &mdash;  and he responded by making the other boy&rsquo;s surname sound like a cake. </p>
<p>&#8216;How can calling a white boy named Brown a chocolate brownie be racist?</p>
<p>&#8216;Harrison was told the word brownie is a racist word. But it&rsquo;s the name of a cake you can buy in any coffee shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Wiener&rsquo;s local MP, former Labour minister Michael Meacher has now written to the school demanding an explanation for the matter.</p>
<p>Thorp Primary School&rsquo;s headmaster, Stuart Bennett, said it would be &#8216;inappropriate to comment about individual cases&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>I know this is a heinous case of critical-theory craziness, illustrating how deeply entrenched social-marxism is in UK public schools, but I cannot stop myself from laughing.</p>
<p>Who would of thought that the mighty English people would be reduced to THIS.</p>

		<p>Sickening is the only word for how the British are allowing their children to be tormented and abused.</p>
<p>In heaven&rsquo;s name, these are your children. How long will you allow them to be tortured?</p>

		<p>A &#8220;snack&#8221;???  Not, Mom!!!  Ha, ha, I laughed at this one; not because I think the kid was treated fairly - he definitely wasn&rsquo;t.  But I say, which is worse - a wiener or a chocolate brownie?  Personally, I think the insinuation with the wiener is worse&hellip; but perhaps that&rsquo;s just my uncouth American sentiments coming to the fore&hellip;<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got an explanation for you, Mr. Meacher.  It&rsquo;s called a mirror   &mdash;   Go and look at one.  On the other side, you&rsquo;ll see a man who probably voted for all of Tony Blair&rsquo;s and Gordon Brown&rsquo;s insane &#8220;equality&#8221; legislation.</p>

		<p>This is what happens when you don&rsquo;t stand up to radicals with an agenda. They just keep pushing and pushing and pushing until the situation is ridiculous and unbearable. They get by with it because we don&rsquo;t want to be nasty. But they don&rsquo;t mind being nasty. That&rsquo;s what they do.</p>

		<p>Sorry if this is a double post, internet hiccup.</p>
<p>I find it incredible that this young boy can be labeled a racist when Mr. Thilo Sarrazin is invited over to argue before experts that &#8216;racism&rsquo; itself is simply the acknowledgement of what long term _environmental deficits_ (which includes both Islam and Africa) can do to a population groups genetic abililty to contribute to a modern society.</p>
<p>Like Germany.</p>
<p>Which positively twists itself into knots over anything related to the Holocaust but at least has the guts to _discuss_ the failures of multiculturalism as &#8216;the diversitudes&rsquo;, upon the bottom line of Europes top economy.</p>
<p>Yet this boy who cannot speak with eloquence to a real problem is held accountable for calling his _white_ schoolmate a type of fudge cake.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tiz not just Germany that is doing away with itself.  And the proof of the multicult&rsquo;s adverse effect on intelligence is _right here_.</p>

		<p>Maybe Harrison should have called that boy &#8220;Wei√üwurst&#8221;. I too know the sting of having an obviously German surname. Unless you are fortunate enough to be in a school that serves a Germanic student base, you are saddled with a 12-year monkey on your back.</p>

		<p>Obviously a failure of the British education system.</p>
<p>Everyone KNOWS that the proper terms for White people are &#8220;cracker,&#8221; &#8220;whitebread,&#8221; and &#8220;pinky.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Remember that the setting for Orwell&rsquo;s book, 1984, was in England.  We are seeing the Big Brother process in full swing there now.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny how socialist-minded, multi-culti liberals claim to be for freedom and against government control, but they tend to be more controlling than any right wingers ever were.  </p>
<p>Stalin, Mao, the Khmer Rouge - they all had socialist, everyone-is-equal fantasies.  They caused more deaths than any right wing rulers ever did.  The problem with right wing governments is that they try to control their borders and some freedom of speech, while extreme liberals go even further and try to get in your head and remake your mind in their image.</p>
