<h1>Arizona Rancher Will Fight Court Order to Pay Damages to Undocumented Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Llorente, Fox News Latino, February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Arizona rancher who was ordered to pay nearly $90,000 in punitive damages to undocumented immigrants he confronted, with a gun, is going to request a rehearing, his attorney said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ll be filing a motion for a rehearing,&#8221; said David T. Hardy, who is representing Roger Barnett. &#8220;He feels he got screwed. I have some sympathy for that view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last week upheld a lower court verdict ordering Barnett to pay the damages for the 2004 incident, in which the plaintiffs claimed that he approached them with his dog and said he&rsquo;d shoot them if they tried to leave.</p>
<p>The court said that an Arizona law permitted a person to threaten to use  &mdash;  or actually use  &mdash;  physical force against someone else when that person believes it is necessary for protection &#8220;against the other&rsquo;s use or attempted use of unlawful physical force.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the court said that Barnett held them at gunpoint even after becoming aware that no one in the group of 16 men and women was armed, and so he could not use the argument of self-defense.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What they [judges] missed was that once he saw they were harmless, he holstered his gun,&#8221; Hardy said. &#8220;When the Border Patrol showed up, [the pistol] was in his holster.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Hinojosa, southwest regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, which represented the plaintiffs in the suit against Barnett, said he is confident the Ninth Circuit Court will deny a rehearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;He pointed the barrel of the gun at every single one of those immigrants,&#8221; said Hinojosa, who was co-counsel in the case. &#8220;He apparently didn&rsquo;t remember yelling racial epithets at the people, or making one lady break down to the point of crying and praying to be let go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The jury believed the immigrants, they didn&rsquo;t believe him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s just a simple delay tactic for Barnett rather than just paying the debt.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said Barnett has been &#8220;swamped&#8221; by the impact of undocumented immigrants and drug smugglers coming onto his property. Hardy said &#8220;the FBI twice told him his life was in danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whole areas of his land have been covered in trash&#8221; left behind by people crossing on it illegally, Hardy said. &#8220;Some are parties of illegal entrants, sometimes there are groups of 40 or 50. He has drug smugglers come through too. They take vehicles and plow through his fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&rsquo;t like illegal immigrants trashing his land,&#8221; Hardy said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think before he cared about the issue [immigration] one way or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He apparently didn&rsquo;t remember yelling racial epithets at the people, or making one lady break down to the point of crying and praying to be let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m curious: being spoken to harshly by a gringo on whose property she was trespassing, did that make that lady cry and pray more or less than when her Mexican &#8220;coyote&#8221; raped her and then, to add insult to injury, threw her panties up into the branches of the nearest Rape Tree   &mdash;   as is standard coyote practice? I&rsquo;d be very interested to know which of these two incidents caused more her crying and praying. </p>
<p>Because if what the rancher did was worth $90,000, I have to assume the pain-and-suffering caused by the coyote would be worth even more. </p>
<p>Do you supposed that is another Social Injustice that MALDEF&rsquo;s Hinojosa will be pursuing in a court of law? Or does his org only go after gringos? </p>

		<p>I hope Mr. Barnett wins. How dare this MALDEF organization help sue a rancher who was trying to protect himself. I&rsquo;m sure that Robert Krentz, the rancher who was murdered by an illegal alien, believed that the illegal alien was harmless and not carrying a gun. This is just an attempt to prevent Americans from fighting illegal immigration anywhere or anyway in this country. Also, this David Hinojosa of MALDEF called the plaintiffs &#8220;immigrants.&#8221; No Mr. Hinojosa. They are illegal aliens and don&rsquo;t you forget it!</p>

<p>That the likely mostly white jury found this man guilty for protecting his own land, is just another display of white do-gooderism which has put us in the position we are in today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called self-destruction. </p>

		<p>I,m still trying to figure out how illegals have any rights in this country at all! let alone to use our legal system too! Did tax paying legal Americans pay for this also! And what about the rancher in Arizona who was murdered by an illegal in 2010? His wife received no justice whatsoever. People, we need to stand together on this and support this rancher, or this will just be the start of lawsuits against Americans from illegals everytime <br>
one of them(or 16) get caught illegaly trespassing.</p>

<p>Is this a liberal euphemism for &#8220;illegal aliens?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;the Mexican American Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, which represented the plaintiffs&hellip;&#8221;  </p>
<p>Oh, I see - a nation within a nation. They&rsquo;re not Americans; they&rsquo;re Mexican Americans - whole different animal - whole different set of rights. And they get $90,000 out of the deal.</p>
<p>Mexican illegals (many of which are notoriously connected to dangerous drug cartels) were on his property and there were sixteen of them and one of him. I sure would have kept my gun on them.</p>

<p>Citizen Barnett had every reason to arrest them with his gun drawn.  Border agents do the same. </p>

		<p>Number 6 has it right.</p>
<p>I have seen what these (not immigrants) but INVADERS do to peoples property when they break Federal Law by sneaking over here.</p>
<p>I have seen where these invaders broke open a 50,000 gallon water holding tank just to get a drink, that would be comparable to making One Toothpick out of a whole tree.</p>
<p>They relieve themselves in a filthy way and don&rsquo;t have enough common sense to at least bury their feces.</p>
<p>Something is going on all right because these people are not taking from America..Certain Americans are making sure they get things they don&rsquo;t deserve WHY IS THAT?</p>

		<p>How is it that ILLEGAL ALIENS have any rights at all in this country???  I think that if they come here, they are asking for maltreatment - they know they aren&rsquo;t supposed to be here, after all!  And so what if the rancher threatened them?  They were on his land, strewing their trash on his property   &mdash;   and he made a woman cry?  Since when is that illegal?  I say that&rsquo;s tough.  No illegal alien deserves ANY rights whatsoever in this country, and the fact that they&rsquo;ve been allowed to sue in our courts is disgraceful.  They need to simply be deported and told to learn their lesson and stay home!</p>

		<p>Yes, because being ounumbered sixteen to one isn&rsquo;t dangerous, and doesn&rsquo;t merit bringing a weapon to even the odds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He apparently didn&rsquo;t remember yelling racial epithets at the people, or making one lady break down to the point of crying and praying to be let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she didn&rsquo;t want that to happen, maybe she should have stayed in her own country, rather than coming over here. Believe it or not, actions have consequences.</p>
<p>In a sane world, these illegal aliens would be back in their home countries right now, with a warning that if they&rsquo;re ever caught in this country illegally again, they&rsquo;ll do time in federal prison, where I&rsquo;m sure the black inmates will be completely and utterly accepting of their diversity. They sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t be getting $90,000 from a private citizen protecting his property (and his country) against trespassers.</p>

		<p>This is such a miscarriage it&rsquo;s hard to wrap your mind around it. Of course the 9th Circus is in bed with every &#8220;unprivileged&#8221; group and pervert that appears before it.  Being radical leftist hacks, these judges twist the law or simply make it up so as to benefit the &#8220;oppressed&#8221;. </p>
<p>Remember it was hack judge Bolton in Arizona who ruled against AZ code 1070, not on the merits, but that implementation of such law would overwork federal employees.  Poor Babies. Since she couldn&rsquo;t find anything prohibitive in the state law, she simply made something up to stop it&rsquo;s implementation. </p>
<p>The same thing obtained in this case with the panel of monkeyshines who ruled for the &#8220;oppressed&#8221;. </p>
<p>Apparently there was no criminal case against the rancher and this is a civil action.  Apparent also is that the evidence surrounding the incident would not sustain a federal or state criminal charge.  To me this means that the rancher acted properly in his own defense.</p>
<p>Had he faced criminal charges, the useless feds would have tacked on hate charges for insulting an &#8220;oppressed&#8221; an superior being.  </p>
<p>The female who was upset wasn&rsquo;t likely crying because of the alleged insults, but because all her efforts, money lost and rapes she endured had come to nothing.  Her dream of working as housekeeper for an understanding and sympathetic white libel lady was gone. <br>
 <br>
The MALDF lawyer Hinojosa said of the rancher.  &#8220;He&rsquo;s notorious for going on to other people&rsquo;s lands and assaulting immigrants in the same or similar manner,&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course no proof was offered and the Fox Latino news service was polite enough to not to ask. <br>

		<p>16 men and he can&rsquo;t call holding a gun on them a while a matter of self-defense?! Absurd, they could have easily killed him unarmed. I saw a police car video where just a few Mexican Illegals tackled a police officer who stopped their car (one went for his legs first and the rest piled on) and they killed him.</p>
<p>WE have to take back our country. A man has a right to do what he did on his own property with illegals who are dangerous.</p>

		<p>This jury must have come from the twilight zone.  I just don&rsquo;t understand how any jury, hearing these facts, could believe that these illegal trespassers should be awarded money.  And what makes matters even worse is the 9th Circus hearing the appeal.  Members of that court actually live in the Twilight Zone.</p>

		<p>So, if they are undocumented immigrants, whose to say they were or were not paid? And exactly what legal recourse would they have if he did not pay them? </p>
<p>Would the DOJ favor undocumented immigrants over an native citizen? It may well appear that way but the DOJ didn&rsquo;t do any favors for itself. Exactly, how are they going to force him to pay undocumented immigrants when there is nothing to send the check to. </p>

		<p>Being confronted by 16 persons that you highly suspect are illegal aliens and are on your land is grounds to draw your weapon. A person in most locales has the right to use reasonable force when making a citizen arrest. This man if unarmed could have been rushed and beaten to death in a heartbeat. And that woman probably could not speak English and did not even understand the &#8220;epithets&#8221;, so called, being directed against here.</p>

		<p>KJL in answer to your question;</p>
<p> &#8220;So, if they are undocumented immigrants, whose to say they were or were not paid? And exactly what legal recourse would they have if he did not pay them?&#8221;</p>
<p>In civil damages, the money goes directly to the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney.  The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney takes his or her fees and expenses off the top, and then disburses it to the successful plaintiffs. MALDEF and the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney will use the local sheriff to take the money from the defendant&rsquo;s bank accounts or if necessary sell off the defendnant&rsquo;s property to satisfy the judgement.</p>
<p> So one can see why MALDEF pursues these kind of cases.</p>
<p>It is also called extortion.</p>
