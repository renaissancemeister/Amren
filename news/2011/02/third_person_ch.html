			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maria Isabel Rocha, 28, of Santa Ana, was charged Wednesday with &#8220;one felony count of murder with sentencing enhancements for the vicarious discharge of a firearm causing death by a gang member and criminal street gang activity,&#8221; according to a statement by the Orange County District Attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Rocha&rsquo;s 17-year-old brother, Ricardo Guerra Rocha, was charged Tuesday with the same counts as his sister, and with an additional count of street terrorism. That same day, Ivan Sanchez, 21, also a resident of Santa Ana, faces similar charges.</p>
<p>The Sanchez and Rocha siblings got into an argument Feb. 13 with another group of people at Mariscos La Ola restaurant in Santa Ana over which state in Mexico is better, prosecutors said. The three defendants left the restaurant and returned several minutes later to the parking lot. They were armed, authorities said.</p>
<p>Esteban Navarrete, 35, was leaving the eatery and getting into his car with his wife and a friend when he was approached by Sanchez and Ricardo Rocha, whom he did not know. {snip}</p>
<p>According to authorities, Navarrete, who has no ties to street gangs, tried to explain that his party was not involved in the earlier argument. But Sanchez is accused of shooting Navarrete once in the head.</p>
<p>Authorities said the defendant fired several other shots, but Navarrete&rsquo;s wife and friend were not struck. {snip}</p>
<p>Sanchez was apprehended by Santa Ana police during a traffic stop as 20-year-old Manuel Toscano was trying to drive the defendant to Mexico, authorities said.</p>

		<p>If someone is keeping track, I&rsquo;m positive they have stats showing that illegals in particular and mestizos in general have a disproportionate amount of crime and violence per their overall numbers within the population of this country.  I&rsquo;ve read so many incidents of murder  &mdash;    &mdash;  - like the above depicts  &mdash;    &mdash;  -involving these people it just seems like one more account of business as usual for the mestizo community.</p>
<p>Of all the lawlessness and anti-white racism by mestizos, from DUI&rsquo;s to ouright murder, they have the audacity to whine about being the victims of white racism, when they are treated better than they would be in their own countries.</p>
<p>Yet there is a VERY LARGE segment of their population here in the US that literally despises whites, because they have been thwarted in achieving a grand migration of illegals which they need in order to steal the country from us in a soft invasion.</p>
<p>Robert Rodriguez has put out a rabidly hateful, anti-white movie entitled Machete that glories the murder of whites.  He has the white actors committing violent acts against illegals, none of which I have ever seen  &mdash;  -or even heard of  &mdash;    &mdash;   while living in heavily mestizo states like Calif., Colorado, Texas, Nevada and Arizona. And the racial slurs he has white actors speaking most certainly were never uttered by whites in the real world.</p>
<p>Finally, someone has the cajones to speak up about anti-white hatred in general and also condemn the movie:  Alex Jones of Prison Planet.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what he had to say about the subjects.</p>

<p>Or, why do they want to come here and make America like Mexico?</p>

Mexican&rsquo;s have a reputation for foolish bravery.<br>
They&rsquo;ll often do a dumb thing and hope to be held in high esteem.</p>
<p>The truth is 4 drug cartels control most of Mexico.</p>
<p>They are the Juarez cartel, the Gulf cartel, the Federation cartel, and the Tijuana cartel and they control Baha California, Sonora, and Chihuahua, Michoacan, and Guerero, and the Yucatan.</p>
<p>Felipe Calderon admitted that in parts of the country, the cartels threaten to replace the state.</p>
<p>That is why American officers train their people on the use of intelligence, planning, and human rights.<br>

		<p>Which Mexican state is better?  Can&rsquo;t just say that there are all in a tie for worst?  If I am wrong than why did you flee from there and sneak through the desert in the middle of the night if the state you are from is so great?  </p>
<p>How can you decide which Mexican state is the best anyways?  If I were a Mexican I would argue that the state that has the most Mexicans to SUCCESSFULLY sneak into the USA without being caught is the winner.  </p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Mexicans, being Third Worlders, do not operate on normal &#8220;logic&#8221;, as we understand it. They could almost argue that 2 plus 2 = 6. And they would belive it! Because they want to. In other words, TRUTH IS WHATEVER THEY WANT IT TO BE. It has no relationship to reality. They have a mystical kind of trust that believing something will make it so   &mdash;   if you believe hard enough.</p>
<p>I once had a Mexican acquaintance who had lived in the US for many years, but who always insisted that Mexico was a much better place, everything in Mexico was wonderful, and that he would far rather be living there.  He saw no inconsistency in this odd statement.</p>

<p>Let us take some comfort from the from the fact that Mexico is almost USA. There is always someplace worse. Despite all its flaws, it is still much better than its neighbors further to the south. For example, Colombia, DomRep, Venezuela, Brazil.  (We won&rsquo;t even mention Haiti.)</p>

<p>There are actually parts of Brazil that aren&rsquo;t so bad. The southern region is majority white, moderately wealthy, and generally fairly safe. It&rsquo;s the majority-black north that&rsquo;s the problem in that country. Indeed, there are a number of nice (and strikingly white) countries in Latin America. But (surprise, surprise) their citizens aren&rsquo;t the ones moving here.</p>

<p>The answer is &#8220;If your state is so wonderful, why did you leave it?&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, this is an absolutely ridiculuous subject for grown men, 28 and 35 years old to argue about, even if gunplay is not involved.  Sadly, this is completely typical of the level of emotional maturity the average Mestizo is capable of.  They&rsquo;re not even mature enough to ascribe the desire on the part of the rest of us that they STAY OUT of our country to anything other than &#8220;racism&#8221;, as if normal, sane people would WANT to have their nation repopulated by a race of violent children.</p>
<p>I was born in Ohio.  If Ohio was that great, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been living in Colorado, northern California and New South Wales, Australia for the last 27 years of my adult life.  I like Colorado well enough, except for that cesspit we call &#8220;Denver&#8221; and the whole bit about driving on snow and ice.  Having an argument with someone over the matter is just outside my experience; reorganizing the basement or garage seems like a more productive use of time.<br>
