			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sharon Noguchi, San Jose Mercury News, February 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Sunday, a day after the 69th anniversary of the executive order incarcerating Japanese-Americans, Rep. Mike Honda called on Americans to end the blaming of immigrants and called for an official U.S. apology for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.</p>
<p>Honda, D-San Jose, spoke to about 200 people gathered for the &#8220;Day of Remembrance&#8221; that solemnly commemorated federal Executive Order 9066, issued Feb. 19, 1942. It authorized the imprisonment of 120,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans during World War II in internment camps.</p>
<p>Sounding like the high-school teacher he once was, Honda tied together events from American history. Years of scapegoating foreigners for economic woes, he said, led in 1882 to the Chinese Exclusion Act. &#8220;1882 was the culmination of things that happened before,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He called for an official U.S. apology for the act, which suspended Chinese immigration, made Chinese living here permanent aliens ineligible for citizenship, and later was extended to other Asians and to bar aliens from owning property.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>With a theme of &#8220;Fighting Against Fear,&#8221; the program organized by the Nihonmachi Outreach committee invited parallels between 1942 and 2011. Yasmin Vanya of the South Bay Islamic Association thanked Japanese-American organizations, which she said were the first groups to reach out to the Muslim community in San Jose after the 2001 terror attacks. &#8220;You stepped up and are making sure this will not happen again,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>China and other nonwhite countries have never openly encouraged persons of other races and/or cultures to move in. So maybe it&rsquo;s time that they started to apologize for their exclusion, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Not that an open invitation to a country like Somalia would necessarily tempt many whites, even liberals, to move there, however.</p>

		<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Japanese who were not naturalized deserved to be sent packing.  Japanese Americans who were citizens deserved to be put under special observation, it was war.</p>
<p>I have equally no problems with limiting the ability of a people who are &#8216;so smart&rsquo; they cannot control their own breeding habits until they spill over on the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Mr. Honda&rsquo;s High School Teachable Moment Hypocrisy (if you can&rsquo;t do&hellip;):</p>
<p>China wants &#8216;Seagulls&rsquo;<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/IyLEo" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/IyLEo</a></p>
<p>i.e.  If you are rich, and have pertinent job skills we will let a tiny fraction of you (580,000 out of 1.2 billion) come and create &#8216;partnerships&rsquo; with Chinese firms.  The rest of you, particularly North Koreans who flee only to be shot or put to hard labor for 12 years&hellip;</p>
<p>STAY OUT!</p>
<p>Two things become clear at this point:</p>
<p>1.  Politicians are showmen.  They have absolutely no technical or intellectual qualifications to do more than &#8216;process&rsquo; the propaganda they are fed as rapidly as possible.  Before regurgitating it to the rest of us like we were somehow chicks to be be educated by their mindless pablum.</p>
<p>2.  We should really begin to wonder if the origin of tyranny (and the PRC is one, make no mistake) is more a function of organizing disparate groups who would otherwise be in lethal competition for limited resources.  If that&rsquo;s what this about, what kind of government would hold our best interests at heart while encouraging a system of divisiveness that &#8216;requires&rsquo; them to act less like America and make -apologies to- places like the PRC?</p>
<p>Unbelieivable.</p>

		<p>There will be no apology for the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese Exclusion Act was a wonderfull act that protected Native Born White Americans from Chinese scab labor.</p>
<p>The two people who  we can thank for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act are Samuel Gompers-socialist and Jewish American-an and an Iirsh immigrant.</p>
<p>Since the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a very powerfull Asian fifth column has sprung up on America soil. There is massive technological espionage. Asians in California have driven Native Born White American youth out of the California State University System. Asians are now a major racial power block in America. How powerfull? Powerfull enough to set into motion the destrcution of centuries of Native Born White American technological and engineering experience-future generations of Native Born White American Engineering talent that wil not be developed included&hellip;this is in the realm of genocide. And as we know from last weeks news story on AmRen, legal immigrant Asians in America are a very serious threat to America&rsquo;s endangered species and the state of Virginia&rsquo;s river system&hellip;this massive level of ecological destruction was set into motion by a single legal immigrant from China who relased a pregnant  snakehead fish into the Potamac River. </p>
<p>The attempted extraction of an apology from Native Born White America is an attempt to change the Native Born White Amerian narrative of US history so as to facilitate a massive influx of Asian high fetility post-1965 legal immigrants.  Honda in other words, is waging race-based psychological warfare.</p>
<p>The fundamental intent is to reduce the Native Born White Majority to a violently persecuted racial minority within the borders of America. And if and when Native Born White Americans are reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America, the post-1965 high fertility Asians in &#8220;America&#8221; will make sure that this will be a permanent state of affairs.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White Americans ever manage to survive all the years that the Chinese Eclusion Act excluded Asians legally? Quite well thankyou.</p>

		<p>So let me get this straight, the current US government is supposed apologize for the fact that the US government of the 1882 was NOT treasonous and did not allow the west coast to become a colony of China.  Well, not to fear, the white republicrats will kneel and beg forgiveness from Mr. Honda and his ilk.  America must be humiliated whenever and wherever possible.<br>

		<p>Legislation barring Asian immigration was extremely popular around the turn of the last century.  </p>
<p>Unlike today, the citizens were actually asked if they approved of invasion by hordes of aliens.</p>

I find Mr. Honda&rsquo;s calls for apology absolutely rich indeed.  For a man descended from people who killed tens of millions in China to call for the US to apologize for Chinese Exclusion Act is very much like the Pot calling the Kettle black.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre</a></p>
<p>However from a historical context I believe it&rsquo;s best to forgive and forget.  Should the Italians be asking the Scotts and Welsh for an apology for what their Celtic forefathers did to Rome?  Should the Germans and French demand reparations from Italy for the massacres perpatrated by the Roman Army in Gaul and Germania?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Rep. Mike Honda &hellip; for an official U.S. apology for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.&#8221;</p>
<p>No. No apology necessary!  Far from it.</p>
<p>University of Delaware Professor Raymond Wolters explains in his superb review of Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans by Jean Phaelzer.  Excerpting:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Between 1849 and 1882, some 282,000 Chinese entered the United States,54 butan additional two million Chinese laborers left their homeland to work in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Caribbean, South America, and Australia. &#8216;No wonder California became alarmed!&rsquo; wrote Robert G. Cleland. If something were not done to restrict immigration, the Chinese in California might turn out to be the vanguard of an army of millions.  According to John W. Caughey, &#8216;the common people of California &hellip; saw themselves about to be crushed between the upper millstone of big business and the nether millstone of coolie labor. That they struck out somewhat blindly and with passion is not surprising.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prominent labor historians also sympathized with the working whites of California. John R. Commons endorsed the statement of a workers&rsquo; convention of 1870: that &#8216;the present system of the immigration of &hellip; coolie labour in these United States is ruinous to the life principles of our Republic, destroying the system of free labour which is the basis of a republican form of government.&rsquo; Philip Taft concluded that there was &#8216;no doubt&rsquo; that the competition of Chinese workers in California &#8216;undercut native and other immigrant workers, and that their living standards and demands were lower than [those of] white workers.&rsquo;  According to Selig Perlman, &#8216;The anti-Chinese agitation in California, culminating as it did in the Exclusion Law passed by Congress in 1882, was doubtless the most important single factor in the history of American labor, for without it the entire country might have been overrun by Mongolian labor and the labor movement might have become a conflict of races instead of one of classes.&rsquo;&#8221; (&#8220;Race War on the Pacific Coast,&#8221; a review by Raymond Wolters of Driven Out, 2007, by Jean Pfaelzer, The Occidental Quarterly, pp 91Spring 2008)<br>

		<p>Funny that the article didn&rsquo;t mention the Italian and German Americans who were also rounded up and incarcerated.</p>
<p>Maybe you can only be &#8220;oppressed&#8221; and demand an apology if you have straight black hair and asian facial features.</p>
<p>And the article didn&rsquo;t mention that at no time in history has either China or Japan opened their borders up on the same terms these Asian types are vilifying America for not allowing.</p>

		<p>What these people seemed to forget or want to overlook is that China/Japan does NOT allow foreigners to come in on such massive scales AND to become citizens as this country does.  This Mr. Honda, another one jumping on the spotlight bandwagon to berate this country over issues that were appropriate during those times.

		<p>The horrible, ignorant racists of the 1880s said that White workers were being replaced by lower paid immigrants.  Can you believe it, even unions were racist in those days!  Some &#8220;alarmists&#8221; even said that Asians might increase in numbers and become a sizeable portion of the population   &mdash;   a majority in some areas.  Not only that, these ignorant 19th century bumpkins said that race mattered and that this would be a bad thing!  It is so clear now that the racial thinkers were stupid and everything they believed was wrong.  That &ldquo;Yellow Peril&rdquo; thing was, like, so evil and false.</p>

This clown just likes pushing limits libs like expanding for his type: the anti white, anti American. <br>
Tell you what, we will apologize after China and Japan do the same. They aren&rsquo;t exactly kind in their treatment of foreigners either. <br>
I also propose a fair trade immigration. We limit their immigration to our country to what they limit ours to theirs. Plus for every one of ours we let in one of theirs. It would only count if ours lives there.   And since most whites and Americans won&rsquo;t be allowed to live much less want to I&rsquo;d say that works. </p>

		<p><i>Years of scapegoating foreigners for economic woes, he said, led in 1882 to the Chinese Exclusion Act.</i></p>
<p>Allowing immigration during a recession exacerbates the unemployment rate. That&rsquo;s not &#8220;scapegoating&#8221;. That&rsquo;s common sense.</p>
<p>===========================</p>
<p>Since Mr Honda is a member of the US Senate, I wonder if he&rsquo;ll be petitioning the Japanese government to apologize for actually <i>starting</i> the war. Or for the millions upon millions of people Japanese troops massacred. Or the horrible atrocities Japanese troops committed against POW&rsquo;s and civilians alike.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should I hold my breath?</p>

		<p>Here is something interesting. The Irish immigrant who played a major role in the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act had extensive correspondence with Karl Marx&rsquo;s daughter on excluding Chinese scab labor from America. She conceded to his economic case against importing Chinese scab labor&hellip;it was just too compelling. However, being heavily influenced by the poltical philosophy of David Hume she was &#8220;religiously&#8221; committed to the poltical-moral abstraction that it is morally wrong to prevent labor from another country-whatever the race-from migrating to America in search of a better life.</p>
<p>Of course this,  is just the Golden Rule of Morality. But in the real word, the people who want to implement this moral &#8220;divine&#8221; edict in immigration policy are neaarly always not in competition with Chinese-and Asian labor in general-scab labor. They are protected from it by their $$$$$$$$$$$$. And in real blood and guts terms, what they are protected from is extreme economic violence that causes a level stress, so high, that it destroys Native Born White American families.</p>
<p>And if there is one thing you can be certain of it is this:if and when Native Born White Americans are reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America, the post-1965 high fertility  Asian &#8220;Americans&#8221; won&rsquo;t suffer from liberal guilt-not a snowballs chance in hell of this&hellip;ever. They will implement a hard-core race based legal immigration policy whose intent is to keep reducing the size of the minority Native Born White American population. And if the Asians have to use force and violence to maintain this new racial order of things&hellip;you can take it to the bank that they will.  </p>

<p>Thanks for posting that account (and others).</p>
<p>My only quibble with the otherwise sagacious (and brave) Professor Wolters is this:</p>
<p><i>the labor movement might have become a conflict of races instead of one of classes.</i></p>
<p>It IS about race, first last and always.  You will never convince me that people divide themselves in any other way.</p>
<p>And to Jupiter7:  Great Post.  Asians have driven out Native Born White Americans from California State Universities AND California Universities, as in UCLA and Berkeley.</p>
<p>I am dreading the college selection process next year with my 17-year old son.  He wants to study either mechanical engineering or physics and has the innate ability to do so, but as he is a White Male, and despite having superior grades and test scores, I know he will be rejected by many of the universities he applies to. </p>
<p>You are right:  This is the road to White Genocide.</p>

		<p>DO you notice the pan-Asian unity here- against whitey? Honda is obviously of Japanese descent. </p>
<p>He never mentions that orientals were and still are something of a 5th column - during WWII 3000 Japanese &#8220;Americans&#8221; went BACK TO JAPAN and joined the imperial army. Not immigrants but US Citizens. Tokyo Rose is among the more famous examples.</p>
<p>During the last Olympics, when dumb white liberals used the torch relay to protest Chinese occupation of Tibet, Chinese &#8216;Americans&rsquo; came out by the THOUSANDS to support CHINA.</p>
<p>Of course this will pass, because if you oppose it you&rsquo;re a racist. Shouldn&rsquo;t we just pass something officially apologizing for being white?</p>

When china apologises for murdering [at least] 45 million of their own that they admit to, as well as all the Koreans and Wietnamese, starting / supplying / backing those two needless wars and all the American lives lost there, and japan apologises for attacking Pearl Harbour and all those attendant unpleasantries, as well as their economic rape of the US and western Europe, THEN I might think about apologising for trying to keep them from beginning an invasion of my country over 100 years ago&hellip;</p>

<p>Native Born White American teenagers should not have to compete with the teenage geneline of post-1965 high fertility Asians for a spot in the California State University system. Asians in America want us to beleive the following very big lie:without legal high fertility post-1965 Asians, Native Born White America would never be able to produce America&rsquo;s doctors,scientists,engineers,computer programmers and other highly skilled technical workers. This is a bold-face lie&hellip;.a very big one. Or to put it another way, post-1965 high fertility Asians in America are demanding that Native Born White Americans -the racial majority from the first days of America&rsquo;s existence-commit racial suicide so Asians can take over and run the place. Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to do this.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. I believe articles posted here in the past showed that, as a result of quotas, Asians need HIGHER test scores to be admitted to universities than whites. They are not beneficiaries of affirmative action. They are getting into the universities on their own competence.</p>
<p>So what exactly are you saying here? That overcompetence is as bad as undercompetence? Are you for affirmative action or against it? You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>

		<p>Google:[ Chinese Exclusion Act 1882 ]</p>
<p>It would seem that piece of legislation is the most heinous and overt codification of racism in American history; however, I do see the logic behind it: back then, other Americans feared Chinese in America, and now, other Americans fear Chinese in China and Asians in America.  2011 - 1882 = 129 years; actually, 2011 - 1949 = 162 years.  Caucasians have feared (and continue to fear) Asians for 162 years, and counting.</p>
<p>Is over-competence as bad as under-competence?  Yes, if Caucasians are being used a baseline for measurement.</p>
<p>To be or not to be?  For or against it?  That is the Affirmative Action question.  They can&rsquo;t have it both ways?  Yes, they do have it both ways.  The elimination of Affirmative Action in university admissions (California) has drastically reduced the enrollments of African Americans and Hispanic Americans, and it is common knowledge that Caucasians can now get by with 140 points less in admission scores when compared to those scores by Asians.</p>
<p>Mechanical Engineering?  Physics?  Don&rsquo;t worry.  As long as that White box on the application is checked, he will get those extra 140 points (I read somewhere that in the University of California  system, it is an additional 200 points, but I simply cannot find the weblink).</p>

		<p>I agree 100% with everything Jupiter7 wrote and would add that the Chinese Exclusion Act was a great thing.  It should be brought back and implimented in every white-created country.  East Asians like a free ride however they can get it whether it&rsquo;s piggybacking off the actions of the black civil rights movement or piggybacking off the education system white people created in America.  Reciprocity is a four letter word to East Asians.  They want every white-created country to open their doors to East Asians in every manner possible at the same time having their doors closed.</p>

<p>Your post is irrelevant-completely. And it is irrelevant because it doesn&rsquo;t address the fundamental point:there are no labor,demographic,cultural and ecological-environmental reasons for importing Asians into America. Why should Native Born White American youth be forced to compete with Asia&rsquo;s youth for a spot in the California State University System? The fact the Asian youth are now being born in America in great numbers is irrelevant. They are an illegitimate presence on American soil&hellip;not only that, these young &#8220;Asian&#8221; Americans can vote for the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority at election time.</p>
<p>I am opposed to affirmative action and I am opposed to Asians being in my country. If they weren&rsquo;t here, Native Born White Americans would still be a racial majority in the California State University System. The Asians invaders used their political muscle to make sure that this demographic situation was reversed.</p>

<p>High-fertility post-1965 Asians in America our interlopers to the American scene. They do not belong here. You response is typical of what comes out of the Asian &#8220;American&#8221;-this is always put in quotes-invaders. Native Born White Americans can survive and prosper without importing even one asian. This is exactly what the Chinese Exclusion Act allowed to ouccr. How did Native Born White Americans manage to survive all the years the Chinese Exclusion Act excluded millions of Asians? Very Well thank you? We put 12 alpha White Males on the moon&hellip;without the help of the predatory post-1965 Asians. This, of course, bothers the heck out of the Asians in America. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  Anon #30</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for.  You might want to re-evaluate your priorities.</p>
<p>Instead of standing with Whites to demand an end to AA, race-based favoritism and preferences, and that the USG defend its southern border against high-fertility, illegal hoards, Asians demand race-based quotas for themselves.</p>
<p>And, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned many times on this forum, Asians are allowed by the USG <i>unlike Native Born White Americans to form race-based advocacy groups to promote, advocate and <b>demand</b> Asian hegemony along with groveling from White Americans (as per the above article).</i></p>
<p>Jared Taylor writes:</p>
<p><i>Asians &mdash; have joined the racial spoils system. They have gotten in right at the top, and they are playing dirty.</i></p>
<p><i>The 80-20 Initiative(&rsquo;s)&hellip; proclaimed goal, is to deliver 80 percent of the Asian vote to candidates it supports, especially in close races where an Asian bloc vote could swing the election&hellip;80-20 wants Quotas for federal judges and top management in government and private industry. And it is playing hardball to get them.</i></p>
<p>M. Taylor goes on to report:</p>
<p><i>But if Asians insist on quotas for judges and CEOs, they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find the tables turned elsewhere. They will pay &mdash; along with whites &mdash; if blacks and Hispanics get serious about quotas in engineering and medicine. Likewise, in a world of quotas, they would see their admissions to the Ivy League cut by two thirds.</i></p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/28zm6am</p>
<p>The UCs in California as well, where Asians dominate.</p>
<p>Berkeley&rsquo;s racial acceptance rate in 2010:</p>
<p>Asians:  45.7%</p>
<p>Whites:  31.7%</p>
<p>Black:  3.4%</p>
<p>Chicano/Hispanic:  11.5%</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/6cf3jpk" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/6cf3jpk</a></p>
<p>Some of the Asian numbers reflect overseas Chinese, recruited by cash-strapped American universities because they pay tuition in full and up-front.  These are college slots that should go to Native Born White American children whose parents are taxed heavily to subsidize public colleges and universities.</p>
<p><i>To recruit new students, public universities like UC Berkeley and San Francisco State are making efforts to attract Chinese students, delivering more than 40,000 undergraduates to the US in the 2009-10 academic year, a 46% increase over the previous year.</i></p>
<p><i>Because of their academic preparation&hellip; and willingness to pay full tuition at cash-strapped campuses</i></p>
<p>Racial makeup of California:</p>
<p>12.5% Asian</p>
<p>42.3% White</p>
<p>36.6% are Hispanic or Latino (of any race)</p>
<p>6.7% Black or African American</p>
<p>As Demographics Is Destiny and ethno-centric Hispanics become more politically powerful in Sacramento, Prop 209 WILL be overturned in favor of  race-based admissions policies at Cal States and UCs, with Hispanic admissions increasing at the expense of Asians AND Whites.</p>
<p>Asians in California will end up in the same boat as Native Born White Americans because an ethno-centric, Hispanic-dominant political body will not concede to your demands, unlike us emasculated Whites who have the government&rsquo;s boot on our necks; we Whites are already used to an anti-White government.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to change strategies as threatening and making demands of a shrinking population of politically neutered White Americans will no longer work. </p>

		<p>Fine, we&rsquo;ll apologize to the Chinese for for the Exclusion Act of 1882 when they apologize for the Boxer Rebellion and outright slaughter of non-Chinese Europeans in their nation. </p>
<p>&#8220;Representative&#8221; Honda conveniently forgets that this law was passed in a democratic land (China STILL fails that test) that attempted to limit the ungoverned, massive migration of third world types into its borders in order to help alleviate the typical working man&rsquo;s family having to subsist on meager wages and when industrial lords were attempting to squeeze bloody profits from the ruthless 12 hour day employment of native-born women and children in our mines and factories.  Soon afterward China&rsquo;s Boxer Rebellion struck out and mercilessly massacred countless missionaries and their families in a ruthless attempt to drive all European &#8220;devils&#8221; out of China. (Missionaries who brought HELP to the Chinese masses who were ignored and neglected by their own &#8216;enlightened&rsquo; rulers.)</p>
<p>    Representative Honda shrewdly advances his resolution today knowing full well that for two generations we&rsquo;ve not been teaching American History from the perspective of the majority that made this nation great.  Unfortunately for him, there are still plenty of us who recall the &#8220;truth&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ll gladly pay for his plane ticket back to the East if he&rsquo;s wishing to go there and take more of his &#8216;thankless&rsquo; Asian refugee-types with him &hellip; . </p>

<p>Asians are well represented at UC schools for one simple reason:hard work.</p>
<p>Go to any urban area with a large Asian population and you&rsquo;ll notice a huge number of &#8220;preparatory&#8221; schools that are designed to coach kids after school so they&rsquo;re able to handle AP classes or do well on the SAT.  Go to any bookstore in Southern California and you&rsquo;ll notice that the kids who study their most often are probably Asian.</p>
<p>As a yellow man I have some regard for my ancestors.  I pity your ancestors they worked and toiled in appauling industrial sweatshops for 12-14 hours a day,they lived without running water or electricity while their descendants (who live in what they would probably regard as sybaratic luxury) complain about the Asians.  They complain while their own children are allowed to watch television and play x-box for hours on end. <br>
  <br>
If you want your kids to go to a good university put away the x-box,cancel the cable tv subscription.   Send your kids to some after school college prep academy.  Sacrifices are required for success and they are comparatively cheap compared to the very high price of failure.    </p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to play the &#8220;we will apologize, if you apologize&#8221; game. It is completely irrelevant to the fundamental issue facing Native Born White Americans in 20011.</p>
<p>By the way, I hope the Chinese in China-who I only wish the best for-throw the African invaders out of their homeland&hellip;either they do this or their Chinese mothers,sisters and wives will be put at great risk. Don&rsquo;t make the stupid mistake White Americans made.</p>
<p>I use a touch screen computer these days. The inventor of touch screen technology-all the rage these days in the tech world- was a Native Born White American of Appalachian ancestry who was a professor  of electical Engineering at the University of Kentucky.</p>
<p>One of the nasty-and out-right evil-consequences of Asian legal immigration is that it undermines public and labor policies aimed at developing the abundant natural talent that resides in Appalachia&hellip;and other groups of Native Born White America. Instead we have the racist liberals of SNC fame and fortune vicious denigraating the intelliegence of Native Born White Americans of Appalachian ancestry. Try doing this about Asians or any other post-1965 high fertility nonwhite group.</p>
<p>Thought experiment:can you imagine what would happen if Jared Taylor,Peter Brimelow and Richard Spencer made comments like the one above in their public appearances. It would really publicly expose the very malignant intentions that high fertility post-1965 Asians in America and the White liberal immigration enthusiasts have towards Appalachian White Americans and White Americans in general. The moral of the story is:if we fight back in a creative way, we will elicit a very strong anti-white racist counter-response from Immigration Enthusiasts. This, of course, means more fee publicity for the White Patriot movement&hellip;more recruits for the White Patriot movement. It is one midnight before midnight for the Native Born White Majority within the borders of America. </p>

		<p>As others have pointed out, it is no country&rsquo;s obligation to take in <i>anybody</i> from <i>anywhere</i>! It is each sovereign country&rsquo;s  absolute right to regulate its immigration (if any at all) as it sees fit, according to its own best interests.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fence, it is no one else&rsquo;s absolute &#8220;right&#8221; to immigrate into any country they wish.</p>

		<p>&#8220;China and other nonwhite countries have never openly encouraged persons of other races and/or cultures to move in. So maybe it&rsquo;s time that they started to apologize for their exclusion, rather than the other way around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incorrect- China tolerated the migration of millions upon millions of Turks, Persians, Arabs, Southeast Asians and various Iranic speaking nomads within their borders.</p>
<p>However, when they started to abuse the local population, they were more or less exterminated wholesale. China did its time already.</p>
