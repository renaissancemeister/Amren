<h1><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1353208/One-doctors-Britain-trained-foreign-country.html">One in Three Doctors in Britain Are Now Trained in a Foreign Country</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than one in three doctors practising in Britain were not trained in the UK, according to the General Medical Council.</p>
<p>The latest figures found that 73,542 doctors, or 37 per cent, were trained in 147 different countries including Mongolia, Sudan and Haiti.</p>
<p>The List of Registered Medical Practitioners includes both GPs and specialists.</p>
<p>It comes as doctors leaders expressed concerns about foreign doctors who are allowed to work in the UK without checks because European laws forbid employers to test their skills if they were trained in the EU.</p>
<p>This applies to 22,000 foreign-born medics, according to the GMC.</p>
<p>Last year, the Nigerian-born German doctor Daniel Ubani was banned from working in the UK in 2010, after he gave a lethal overdose to a 70-year-old patient on his first shift working for a private out-of-hours firm.</p>
<p>David Gray had been suffering from renal colic when he was treated by Ubani at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, in 2008.</p>
<p>It emerged that Ubani was unfamiliar with the drug diamorphine and its administration. </p>
<p>Figures from 2009 reveal that 51 out of 83 doctors who were struck off that year had gained their qualifications outside Britain and 12 of these had qualified in Europe.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who is on a Commons health select committee said there was a growing concern that these doctors, who may have poor English, are now able to work in Britain.</p>
<p>Some hospitals have even introduced language lessons to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>&#8216;You can practise here from Australia and have to take a test but from Poland no language test may be applied under EU regulations,&rsquo; she told the Daily Express.</p>
<p>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council agreed. He said: &#8216;We are calling for urgent legal change so we can be sure that all doctors on the register have the necessary language skills to practise safely in the UK.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>According to the World Health Organization, Britain has two physicians per 1000 population.</p>
<p>By comparison, Nigeria has one physician for every 4000 people.</p>
<p>These foreign doctors must be sent back to their homelands immediately to redress the imbalance.  </p>

		<p>Socialized medicine created an artificial shortage of native healthcare workers because it wasn&rsquo;t profitable. Then the gov made up the shortfall by importing 3rd worlders. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the reverse of what happened in the US construction industry. Here, contractors drove down wages with an oversupply of cheap illegal labor. And that created an artificial shortage of native construction workers.</p>

		<p>So, long story short: don&rsquo;t get sick in England.</p>
<p>And if you -do-, make sure the guy has a complexion somewhere near milk -and- can respond with more than grunts and smiles when you try to strike up a conversation -before- letting him stick any needles in you.</p>
<p>The more the world changes&hellip;</p>

		<p>We have the same problem here. It is all so totally wrong.</p>
<p>They are bad news, you can not understand what they are saying, you get blank stares or other looks of incomprehension if you try and talk to them. You simply just can not relate to them. Their qualifications are often questionable.Their standards of hygiene are often deplorable. The latest incident that I the misfortune to observe was this Indian Dr Scratching his hair and continually rubbing his nose while idly fiddling with a tray of medical instruments.</p>
<p>Here, these 3rd world Drs are mainly to be found in Hospital emergency departments or low cost medical centres. I avoid them totally.</p>
<p>One can wonder why they are not practicing in their home countries where I am sure their services are very much needed. (Obviously there is more money to be made in the West)</p>

		<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s very rare to come across a British doctor or dentist in the NHS.<br>
 The vast majority are subcontinentals, apart from that they can come from literally anywhere in the world.<br>
  A strange state of affairs.Usually the medical profession is regarded as the &#8216;best&rsquo; job going, and so is monopolised by the dominant or founding ethnicity.In England this certainly does not apply.</p>

		<p>This same phenomenon will happen in the U.S. if Obamacare isn&rsquo;t repealed.  I wrote about this in a comment (#29) under an Amren article on January 19 regarding a coming doctor shortage.  It bears repeating.  </p>
<p>If Obamacare isn&rsquo;t repealed, more and more white doctors will choose to retire and leave their practices rather than have to deal with more government regulations and paperwork for less compensation.  To make up for the doctor shortage and to help keep costs down, the government will have to employ more minority (usually immigrant) Physicians&rsquo; Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, and Foreign Medical Graduates who will handle your healthcare.  </p>
<p>If patients do get to see an M.D., many more of those doctors (like in Britain) will be foreign medical graduates whose training is less certain.  Patients will be getting less care which will lead to an increase in the death rate.  </p>

		<p>We already have a similar situation in the US, only the foreign doctors mostly go to medical school in the US.</p>

		<p>As ATBOTL says, the same thing is happening here in the U.S. These foreign-born and (often) foreign-trained doctors are far more likely than American-born doctors (the white ones, at least!) to be involved in the grossest sorts of malpractice, sexual assault of patients, insurance fraud, late-term abortion, the running of abortion &#8220;mills,&#8221; etc. And huge numbers of nurses are being imported from overseas. And don&rsquo;t get me started on the staffing of old folks&rsquo; homes! The outrages perpetrated against the warehoused elderly would make your blood run cold.</p>
