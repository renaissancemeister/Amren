<h1><a href="/ar/1991/05/index.html">Abraham Lincoln and the Problem of Slavery</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward Kerling, American Renaissance, May 1991</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<span class="dropcap">I</span>n 1989, to celebrate the 25th 
anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, President George Bush 
invited a number a black leaders to the White House. In his remarks on 
that occasion, the President said he looked forward to the day when 
Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s vision would be fully realized, and a black man would 
sit in the oval office. 
				<p>
					With all due respect for President Bush, one can say with complete 
confidence that Lincoln never envisaged a black president. He made it 
clear on many occasions that he abhorred the very thought of social or 
political equality for blacks, and that although he considered slavery 
an evil, he saw no future in America for free blacks. He thought that 
the races should be separated, and until the very end of his life he did
 everything within his power to remove blacks from the territory of the 
United States. The Abraham Lincoln of history is vastly different from 
&#8220;the great emancipator&#8221; whose racial views have been increasingly 
shrouded in myth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b> Views on Slavery </b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Though he did not, himself, own slaves, Lincoln showed no marked 
antipathy for those who did. In his legal practice, before entering 
politics, he represented slaveholders in cases involving runaway slaves.
 During his career as a Whig Congressman, he mustered party support for 
the slaveholder Zachary Taylor&rsquo;s 1842 bid for the presidency. His wife, 
Mary Todd, was the daughter of one of Kentucky&rsquo;s most prominent 
slaveholders, and when the South seceded many of his in-laws went with 
it. 
				</p>

				</tbody></table>
				<p>
					After he switched to the newly-formed Republican party and received
 its nomination for the presidency, Lincoln outlined his views on 
slavery in the famous Cooper Union speech of February 27, 1860. He 
endorsed Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s view that slavery should neither be extended
 into new territories nor abolished in those regions where it was 
already practiced: 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					&#8220;As those [founding] fathers marked it, so let it again be marked, 
as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only 
because and so far as its actual presence among us makes that toleration
 and protection necessary.&#8221; Speaking for his party, he said, &#8220;this is 
all Republicans ask   &mdash;   all Republicans desire   &mdash;   in relation to slavery.&#8221; 
				</blockquote>
				<table class="quoteleft">
					<tbody><tr>
						<th>
							I am not in favor of bringing about the social and political equality of black and white races. 
						</th>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
				<p>
					From today&rsquo;s perspective, such a position seems hopelessly 
ambiguous, and even at the time it was subject to attack. Anyone who 
described slavery as an evil sounded like an abolitionist, but the 
question all abolitionists had to answer was how to treat the slaves 
once they had been freed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lincoln had answered this question during his 1858 campaign against
 Steven Douglas for the U.S. Senate. Abolition was a topic of much 
debate, but the notion of equality for blacks was resisted by most 
Americans. Douglas&rsquo; supporters tried to undermine Lincoln by spreading 
rumors that he was an egalitarian, but on September 18 he made his 
position clear, in words that sound quite shocking today: &#8220;I am not, nor
 ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and 
political equality of the white and black races; I am not nor ever have 
been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying 
them to hold office, nor intermarry with white people.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					The offices from which blacks were to be barred presumably included the presidency. Lincoln went on: 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					&#8220;I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference
 between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid 
the two races living together on terms of social and political 
equality.&#8221; 
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Lincoln, like many thoughtful people of his time, faced a serious 
moral and social dilemma. Chattel slavery was an abomination, but a 
multi-racial society of mutual equality was unthinkable. What, then, was
 the status of the black American to be? Was there a humane, ethical 
solution to this problem? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lincoln lived in an era in which even a politician could get a 
nickname like Honest Abe. In his analysis of the race problem   &mdash;   which 
was then, and still is, the most sensitive and controversial one facing 
the nation   &mdash;   he lived up to his reputation. As early as 1857, in a 
speech at Springfield, Illinois, he had struck the theme to which he 
would adhere for the rest of his life: 
				</p>
				<table class="quoteright">
					<tbody><tr>
						<th>
							&#8220;Let us be brought to believe it is morally right to transfer the
 African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do it.&#8221; 
						</th>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						&#8220;There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white 
people to the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and 
black races. A separation of the races is the only prevention of 
amalgamation  &hellip; 
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8220;Such separation  &hellip; must be effected by colonization  &hellip;
 The enterprise is a difficult one, but where there is a will there is a
 way, and what colonization needs now is a hearty will. Let us be 
brought to believe it is morally right to transfer the African to his 
native clime, and we shall find a way to do it, however great the task 
may be.&#8221; 
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In Lincoln&rsquo;s mind, the establishment of colonies of blacks outside 
the territory of the United States was the only way to navigate between 
the twin evils of slavery and multi-racialism. After his election as 
President he used his office as best he could to follow this course. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b> War-time Colonization Policy </b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					By the time Lincoln took the oath of office on March 4, 1861, seven
 southern states had already seceded. The nation faced an urgent crisis 
that many believed would plunge it into war. Only a month later, the 
Confederates captured Fort Sumpter and the conflict had begun. It is 
astonishing to realize that even at this time of great fear and turmoil,
 Lincoln was spending precious hours working out a colonization plan. 
The war was only a month old by the time he had prepared a five-point 
program to free the slaves and separate the races: 
				</p>
				<ol><li>
						The states must voluntarily emancipate the slaves, because slavery was an internal matter, subject to state authority. 
					</li><li>
						Slaveholders were to be paid for the loss of their property. 
					</li><li>
						The federal government would give the states financial aid to help compensate slaveholders. 
					</li><li>
						The actual freeing of slaves would be gradual, so as to prevent 
economic dislocation. Some states might wait until the year 1900 to free
 their last slaves. 
					</li><li>
						Free blacks were to be persuaded to leave the United States and be colonized. 
					</li></ol>
				<p>
					Lincoln soon began looking for suitable territories for 
colonization. Ambrose Thompson, a wealthy shipping magnate, had gained 
control of several hundred thousand acres in the Chiriqui district of 
what is now Panama. He proposed to develop coal mines in this territory 
and to use colonized blacks as labor. Later, the blacks would work their
 own plantations of cotton, sugar, and tobacco. Lincoln appointed a 
special commission to investigate the feasibility of this plan. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Late in 1861, while Thompson&rsquo;s plan was being studied, Lincoln 
personally drafted an emancipation bill for the state of Delaware. 
Delaware was a slave state, but it had only 1,800 slaves in 1860, and 
had decided to stay with the Union. Lincoln&rsquo;s proposal would have 
offered federal compensation to slaveholders, and the President hoped 
that it would become a model for the three other slave states that had 
stayed loyal to the Union. Eventually, he hoped to persuade the 
Confederate states to adopt the same scheme. To his disappointment, the 
bill was defeated in the Delaware legislature by a combination of 
pro-slavery sentiment and partisan conflict. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lincoln did not give up. In his first annual message to Congress on
 December 3, 1861, he proposed that all blacks who had fallen into the 
hands of Union forces should be deemed free. He proposed that &#8220;steps 
should be taken for colonies for them  &hellip; at
 some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well 
to consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the United 
States  &hellip; could be included in such colonization.&#8221; 
				</p>

				<p>
					Just a few months later, in April, 1862, Lincoln succeeded in 
applying his freedom plan to the only portion of United States territory
 over which he felt the federal government had appropriate jurisdiction:
 Washington, D.C. The district&rsquo;s slaveholders were to be compensated an 
average of $300 for each of their 3,185 slaves, and an additional 
$100,000 was appropriated &#8220;to aid in the colonization and settlement of 
such free persons of African descent now residing in said District, 
including those liberated by this act  &hellip;&#8221; 
When he signed the bill, Lincoln noted with satisfaction that his two 
principal approaches to the problem of slavery   &mdash;   compensation and 
colonization   &mdash;   had been incorporated into the law. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In July of the same year, Lincoln signed a bill that provided 
$500,000 for use by the President in colonizing blacks who fell into the
 hands of the Union army. This was in addition to the $100,000 voted 
earlier. Coming at a time when the war was going very badly for the 
North, and when the budget was swamped with military expenses, these 
appropriations suggest how fervently Lincoln desired the separation of 
the races. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lincoln did not hesitate to state his case directly to blacks. On 
August 14, 1862, he spoke to the first delegation of blacks ever to be 
invited to the White House: 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any two races  &hellip;
 [T]his physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I 
think your race suffers very greatly, many of them, by living among us, 
while ours suffers from your presence.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated,&#8221; he 
concluded, and urged the delegation to find men who were willing to 
move, with their families, to Central America. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lincoln had even appointed a Commissioner of Emigration, Reverend 
James Mitchell, whose job it was to organize colonization. The day after
 the meeting with the black delegation the commissioner placed the 
following ad in newspapers: &#8220;Correspondence is desired with colored men 
favorable to Central American, Liberian or Haytien [sic] emigration, 
especially the first named.&#8221; He also issued a memorandum to black 
ministers, urging them to promote emigration. 
				</p>
				<p>
					These measures met with some small success, and were supported by 
many whites. When a group of 61 blacks passed through Cleveland on its 
way to Boston for passage to Haiti, the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote, 
&#8220;We hope the remainder of our dusky brethren will follow their example.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					On September 12, 1862, five days before Lincoln issued the 
preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, the federal government signed a 
contract with Ambrose Thompson for colonization on the Thompson lands in
 Chiriqui. The contract included a signed statement from the President 
directing the Secretary of the Interior to execute the contract. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The very day before issuing the Proclamation, Lincoln signed a 
contract for the resettlement of 5,000 free blacks on an Island near 
Haiti. Tragically, the contractor turned out to be a cruel swindler, who
 rounded up several hundred ex-slaves and left them on an uninhabited 
island, where most of them died. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b> The Emancipation Proclamation </b> 
				</p>
				<table class="boxright">

				<p>
					In the Proclamation itself, made public on September 17, Lincoln 
repeated his desire to compensate slaveholders within the Union for the 
emancipation of their slaves, and to promote colonization. However, this
 was only a proposal; the President made no attempt to free the slaves 
in the four slave states that had remained in the Union, nor in those 
parts of the Confederacy that were under Union control. The only slaves 
whom he unilaterally declared free were those in territory controlled by
 the Confederates, and who were therefore entirely beyond his power to 
free. Moreover, Lincoln promised the states of the Confederacy that 
their practice of slavery would remain unmolested if they stopped their 
&#8220;rebellion&#8221; within 100 days. 
				</p>
				<p>
					By means of the Proclamation, Lincoln was clearly adhering to a 
policy he had spelled out in a letter to the New York Times less than a 
month earlier: 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and 
is not to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without 
freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all 
slaves I would do it; and if I could save it be freeing some and leaving
 others alone I would do that.&#8221; [Emphasis in the original.] 
				</p>
				<p>
					Historians still wonder how Lincoln thought he could help save the 
Union by claiming to free slaves over whom he had no control. Some 
believe that he hoped to counteract the military benefits the 
Confederacy enjoyed by its efficient use of slaves. Others argue that he
 hoped to gain foreign credibility by giving the war a moral rather than
 a strictly geo-political purpose. It is also possible that he meant to 
head off radical abolitionists who wanted to emancipate all slaves 
unconditionally. In any case, it is clear that freedom for slaves was 
strictly subordinate to other purposes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is no surprise, therefore, that in his next message to Congress 
on December 1, 1862, Lincoln had little to say about the Proclamation, 
and much to say about his favored plan: 
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8220;That portion of the earth&rsquo;s surface which is owned and inhabited 
by the people of the United States is well adapted to be the home of one
 national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					He continued: 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					&#8220;I have urged colonization of the Negroes, and I shall continue. 
					<p>
						&#8220;My Emancipation Proclamation was linked with this plan  &hellip; 
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8220;I can conceive of no greater calamity than the assimilation of the Negro into our social and political life as our equal  &hellip; 
					</p>
					<p>
						&#8220;We cannot attain the ideal union our Fathers dreamed, with 
millions of an alien, inferior race among us, whose assimilation is 
neither possible or desirable.&#8221; 
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Lincoln then went on to propose an amendment to the Constitution 
that would give Congress the power to appropriate money and send free 
blacks, with their consent, to places outside of the United States 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b> The Plan Fails </b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					This was not to be. Nor did the Thompson plan for Colonization in 
Chiriqui prove feasible. On September 5, 1862, a scientist reported that
 the Chiriqui coal was very low grade and that the land &#8220;will always be 
of little or no value to its owners.&#8221; 
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, no other country wanted the freed blacks. On September
 19, the Washington representative of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and 
Honduras denounced the attempt to cast upon Central America &#8220;a plague of
 which the United States desired to rid themselves.&#8221; The diplomat hinted
 that the territories he represented would use force to repel any 
colonizing expedition. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lincoln was forced to set aside his plans for colonization, but 
they remained an important part of his thinking. General Benjamin Butler
 reported a conversation with the President in early April of 1865, by 
which time the war had been won and Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination was only a 
few days away. Lincoln said to him, &#8220;But what shall we do with the 
Negroes after they are free? I can scarcely believe that the South and 
the North can live in peace, unless we can get rid of the Negroes.&#8221; 
Lincoln then spoke of Butler&rsquo;s experience in moving large numbers of men
 by sea, and mentioned that the United States had a large navy. He asked
 Butler to draw on his wartime experience and devise a plan to send 
blacks overseas. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout his presidency, therefore, Lincoln tried to implement 
the plan outlined by Jefferson: gradual emancipation, compensation to 
slaveholders, colonization of freed blacks, and the promotion of white 
immigration to take the place of black labor. It is only by means of the
 most willful disregard for the historical evidence that Lincoln can be 
construed as a champion of racial equality. In his mind, emancipation 
was linked to colonization, and he might well have opposed it if he had 
thought that free blacks would remain in the United States. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a sad irony in the fact that our current President should 
be so ignorant about his predecessor&rsquo;s thinking as to believe that 
Lincoln looked forward to the day when the United States would elect a 
black to its highest office. To be sure, Lincoln did meet the first 
black delegation ever to visit the White House   &mdash;   but only to urge them 
and their brethren to leave the country forever. Today, thinking about 
race is so clouded that it obscures even the past.

		<p>Lincoln, like most Yankee politicians was a pure double talker, saying what was needed to put himself in a position to do the opposite. PLEASE AMREN Do not make a hero out of this cunning short-sighted person. Sorry to Southerners but the Blacks should&rsquo;ve gotten an independent state in Florida with population exchanges, like a peninsular Haiti. Easier than the Repatraition to Africa pipe dream or the path of Civil War, Reconstruction, Segregation &amp; Black Power.</p>

		<p>The problem with this article is that it assumes that the Civil War had to begin.  At the time of Fort Sumter, many states that were eventually part of the Confederacy had not seceded.  It was Lincoln&rsquo;s immediate call for troops to attack the seceded states that drove Virginia and other states to secede themselves.  Lincoln blundered into war, and then made it worse for himself by driving off other states.  If Lincoln had reconciled himself to negotiating free navigation of the Mississippi River (he probably could have got it), preventing westward expansion of the Confederacy (feasible), and proposing emancipation plans for states that had not seceded, then the federal government would not have been overwhelmed with war expenses and could have afforded compensated colonization.  As to where to put them, he should have reserved use of the U.S. Navy and Marines to plunk the freed slaves right where they were taken in Western Africa.</p>

		<p>As late as February 1865 Lincoln made an appeal to the Confederate leaders that the war would come to an end if the slaves would be freed. To no end. And this when the Yankees had the Confederates on the ropes. NO further fighting would have taken place but alas we know the rest.</p>

		<p>I appreciate truthful articles like this one.  Too many conservatives are Southern sympathizers without realizing what would have happened if the South had had their way.  More and more blacks would have been shipped over to the South, only speeding up the decline of white America.  Lincoln, was above all else, an American patriot.  He neither wanted war nor to abolish slavery.  It was the Southerners who forced his hand when THEY attacked the Union at Fort Sumter, not the other way around.</p>
<p>I also take offense when I read inane suggestions that cast all Northerners as the enemy.  As someone whose state was founded in violence (earning the nickname &#8220;Bleeding Kansas&#8221;), I know the history of pro-slavery violence as well.  Thankfully, Kansas was founded as a free state, that ALSO BANNED FREE BLACKS.  Early Kansans (like much of the north) didn&rsquo;t want slaveholders, but more importantly didn&rsquo;t want blacks.  This has paid off for the state, which has a black population at only 7%, much lower than those of other slave states.</p>
<p>Lincoln was a race realist.  The South started the war, and rightfully lost it.  If Lincoln would had survived, and his plan been put to fruition, whites today would be better off.  </p>

		<p>One of the first pieces of advice offered to us young history majors by the head of our department at the university was:  &#8220;NEVER make the foolish and ignorant mistake of judging the past by the standards of the present!!!&#8221;  We were trained to do our best to place ourselves into the mind-set of the time period we were investigating, so that we could understand it from the point of view of the people who participated in it.  Today, historians are clearly both ignorant and foolish, because all they do is judge the past by today&rsquo;s standards!  It proves to me that the people who pass for &#8220;educated&#8221; today, are NOT educated; they are brainwashed, and are incapable of producing any new insights on the proud history of our country.  They are good only for pointing the finger of blame at our forefathers, and anyone with any intelligence can see that such a practice demonstrates a complete lack of ability and wisdom, and is a cheap and lower-class method to try and convince their hearers that they have some knowledge.  In fact, they don&rsquo;t.  They are blamegamers, not scholars.  It&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>

<p>Another possible consequence, and I say &#8220;possible&#8221; because playing &#8220;what if&#8221; games with history is always dangerous   &mdash;   An independent South would have been a free trade zone next to an independent high tariff zone north.  Therefore, that would have defeated the purpose of the high tariffs in what was left of the Union, to protect the infant manufacturing base.  Established European manufacturers would have been able to get their goods duty-free into the CSA where they would have been able to be smuggled into the USA and created a black market of cheap manufactured goods, undercutting the USA&rsquo;s manufacturing growth.  This in turn would have precluded the development of a high paid working middle class, which was only possible because in reality, north and south were under one nation post 1865, with high tariffs, with a growing manufacturing base and its high value added economics, combined with the eventual organized labor movement fairly distributing some of these profits to labor.  A lot of these beneficiaries, I might add, were poor Southern whites who migrated northward to the factory cities.</p>
<p>The downside is that the Union victory permanently poisoned the Constitution with the double whammy of racial egalitarianism (in spite of Lincoln&rsquo;s personal feelings) and presumed Federal supremacy in governmental affairs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It proves to me that the people who pass for &ldquo;educated&rdquo; today, are NOT educated; they are brainwashed, and are incapable of producing any new insights on the proud history of our country. They are good only for pointing the finger of blame at our forefathers, and anyone with any intelligence can see that such a practice demonstrates a complete lack of ability and wisdom, and is a cheap and lower-class method to try and convince their hearers that they have some knowledge. In fact, they don&rsquo;t. They are blamegamers, not scholars. It&rsquo;s pathetic&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right. I would say for most of our lifetimes &#8216;history&rsquo; is not intended to be a history at all. Each time the word history is used, it would be more accurate to instead insert the word &#8216;emotion&rsquo;. If the word emotion were to be substituted each place the word history is used it would provide a more accurate explanation for what is being discussed. </p>

		<p>I agree with 4-Greg: &#8220;More and more blacks would have been shipped over to the South, only speeding up the decline of white America.&#8221; As the world knows, we have the example of Haiti as being the result of the importation of Slaves taken to the extreme. I could see where the same thing would have happened to the South, but at a later date. Given such an event though, the White Northerners (combined with exiled Southerners) may well have bordered off the South and we would have ended up with a White ethno-state after all. It seems to me as though we are heading there now, but that we&rsquo;re just taking a different route to the end of a united America.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a total cynic. </p>
<p>Lincoln made those statements when he was facing re-election for his second term.  The civil war was unpopular in the north for many reasons.  He suspended habeaus corpus and kept 40,000 newspaper editors and publishers in jail for the entire 4 years.  The immigrants wanted nothing to do with it, and hated the draft.  So did the native white working class.  The war destroyed many areas of the border states.</p>
<p>The working class, the majority of voters had enough to deal with the competition from European immigrants.  They did not want more job competition from American blacks.</p>
<p>I doubt Lincoln was sincere in his plans.  Even if he were, how would the southern economy have survived without free blacks?  How would the wolves of wall street been able to invade the south, take over the coal fields and farms, build their horrible textile sweatshops without a huge hungry for any kind of job mass of free blacks and dispossesed whites to exploit?</p>
<p>Also I am sure the northern canniblal capitalist sweatshop owners were eager to add free blacks to their mess of immigrants bringing down wages.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than a campaign promise, like the endless promises to fix immigration.</p>

<p>RE: the Panama coal mine idea.  Sounds like the colonizer just wanted a lot of cheap labor.  would have been a nightmare for the blacks, shipped off to a malaria and yellow fever ridden swamp.  Remember, DeLesseps tried for years to build the Panama canal.  He failed because most of the work force died of yellow fever.  </p>
<p>We succeeded in building the canal because of a decision to learn how to prevent yellow fever before sending another workforce to Panama. Panama would have been a death trap for the blacks, just as it was a death trap for DeLesseps workforce.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that nobody has even hinted around this question, because it usually comes up in AR stories dealing with American history from 1861-5.  The question is something along the lines of this   &mdash;   Why are AR readers and regulars so sympathetic to the Southern cause when the Southern agrarian elite feted the importation of so many non-whites?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t answer the question about the paradox, but I think the first part of the question has an easy answer.  Traditionally and for obvious reasons, (Patterson&rsquo;s First Axiom), white Southerners are the repository of both (A) a natural constituency for racialist thinking, a group of whites who have a practical built in motivation to adopt that worldview, (as opposed to taking the theoretical positions of WN and/or RR in the context of a debating society) and (B) The translation of that worldview onto the political process and into the realm of public policy formation.</p>

		<p>13-QD: &#8220;Why are AR readers and regulars so sympathetic to the Southern cause when the Southern agrarian elite feted the importation of so many non-whites?&#8221; Well, my take is that those commenters who are so sympathetic to the Southern cause, are indeed from the South.  And, it may be that they stand so firmly on their racialist thinking platform due to some sense of built in guilt.  In other words, they sense their ancestors actions did indeed cause great harm to the nation, and so they attempt to evade any associated shame by standing tall on the pro-White race realist line of thought. Maybe even to the point of asking a question that no one else really ponders, in order to put forth an answer outlining Southerners as being somehow different, or even naturally better than any other group at leading a White Nationalist or Race Realist effort.  Granted, that may not be the case, but sometimes even a paradox can have a rather straight forward answer.</p>

		<p>I am surprised that nothing in this article mentions Liberia and the repatriation program that had been going on for most of the early 19th century.  It was begun by President Munroe and seemed to be a great success, even if they returning blacks were resented by the natives.  If Lincoln had been serious about this idea, he could have easily sold it as a plan to gradually buy out the slaves from plantations and systematically restore them to Liberia.  It would not have been any worse for the blacks than it was for the European immigrants that were struggling when they first arrived here during what would have been the same time periods.</p>
<p>That Liberia has had trouble lately is only reflective of the state of modern Africa, not that the premise of Liberia was erroneous.  It was a brilliant and just solution to correct a mistake.  Why Lincoln seems to have ignored it and no one discussed it in that period puzzles me.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight, Liberia was a failure from the start, and only survived because the US propped it up. As a social experiment, it failed dismally. Left to their own devices, blacks proved themselves incapable of running a country. Only a handful of blacks were successfully repatriated, and after a short time most were eager to return to the land of the Evil White Oppresssor Man, where the gubmint would take care of them. <br>

<p>The slave trade was already banned well before the US civil war began. It was an international issue, I believe. Would they have snuck in anyway, perhaps from the South? What many people do not know is that a good deal of immigration into America constituted free blacks from Latin and South America moving to the US under their own volition. This was going on even before (and after) the immigration act of 1920? This immigration was hidden, a bit, by wording of the immigration laws of the time. If you were from Central or South America it was easier to gain entrance to the USA. Reading the immigration laws, one would not assume blacks were the ones being so freely admitted. </p>

		<p>I have mixed feelings on this. I generally agree that the civil war was fought for 3 reasons:</p>
<p>1) Slavery (which was bad for the south anyway)<br>
2) Tariffs (Forcing the south to pay 89% of the taxes and then spending it on railroads/canals for the north is why slavery ended peacefully everywhere else)<br>
3) Immigrants (Overwhelmingly opposed slavery and drove a wedge between the north and the south. Compare a map of the states by % population immigrants vs % voted for Lincoln if you don&rsquo;t believe me. States with mass immigration voted more for Lincoln.)</p>
<p>At the end of the civil war I believe Florida had maybe 500,000 whites in it and we could have just sent them all there. I don&rsquo;t believe Lincoln ever had any plans to remove the blacks, it was just a campaign promise. </p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to blame Lincoln for the war itself in any way, like some white nationalists do. It effectively started before he took office.</p>

		<p>Enough of this South bashing. Yes, Southerners bought slaves, and what a terrible mistake it was. But just who were the people who sold them to us? Mainly Yankee and British shippers. New England and Britain grew filthy rich off the slave trade and then blamed slavery solely on the South. At least one Southern state, Virginia, tried to ban the slave trade during the colonial period, but the British would not allow it.</p>
<p>As for the claim that we started the so-called &#8220;civil war,&#8221; nothing could be more totally false. The Northern provisioning of Fort Sumter was a blockade of Southern port, an act of war. The fort itself had become the possession of a sovereign state which had legally seceded. </p>
<p>The warmonger Lincoln cynically gave the South the choice of either losing one of its major ports, or responding with force to his blatant provocation. Lincoln and the monied interests behind him got what they wanted.          </p>

		<p>Countries need myths, just as individuals benefit emotionally by not viewing themselves and their pasts with too much scrutiny. A cherished American myth is that Abraham Lincoln was the Great Emancipator: a self made man from the frontier who devoted and eventually lost his life to his goal to achieve freedom and equal rights for blacks.<br>
 <br>
Another myth is that blacks deserve this because they are equal to whites except for a few minor problems that are dwindling consequences of fading aspects of white racism.<br>
 <br>
Readers of American Renaissance, and indeed most Americans at some level of consciousness, know that these myths are delusions. Nevertheless, an obsession with the truth is harmful to emotions that are beneficial if we are to thrive as a nation.<br>
 <br>
Sometimes it is best not to talk about the crazy aunt in the attic unless she makes so much noise that she cannot be ignored. For the last generation the crazy aunt has been fairly quiet. There has not been a major black ghetto riot since 1992. The crime rate has declined since 1980. </p>
