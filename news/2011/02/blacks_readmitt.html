<h1>Blacks Readmitted to Hospital More Than Whites: Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Serena Gordon, U.S. News &amp; World Report, February 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After leaving the hospital for treatment of three common conditions, older black people are more likely to be readmitted within 30 days than older white people, a new study finds.</p>
<p>Overall, older blacks have 13 percent greater odds of being readmitted to the hospital, recent research suggests, while patients treated at hospitals that primarily serve minority populations have 23 percent greater odds of readmission within 30 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are significant racial disparities in readmission rates in this country,&#8221; said the study&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Karen Joynt, a health policy fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that both race and site of care mattered. The next step is to find out why this disparity exists,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Using national Medicare data that included more than 3 million hospital discharges for heart attack, congestive heart failure and pneumonia, the researchers compared the rate of readmissions for blacks and for whites. To conform with other research, the researchers considered any non-black patients as white, which means that Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans were placed in the white category for this study.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of the 3 million plus discharges, 276,681 (8.7 percent) were for black patients, and 2,886,330 (91.3 percent) were for white patients. About 40 percent of the black patients and 6 percent of white patients received care at hospitals that primarily served minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Overall, readmission rates were 24.8 percent for blacks and 22.6 percent for whites, which means black patients have 13 percent greater odds of readmission within 30 days after discharge, according to the study.</p>
<p>Among those who had been admitted for heart attack, black patients from minority-serving hospitals had the highest readmission rates  &mdash;  26.4 percent, according to the study. That translated to 35 percent greater odds of readmission for this group.</p>
<p>The results of the study are published in the Feb. 16 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>Joynt said this study wasn&rsquo;t able to tease out the reasons that these disparities exist, but said that less access to transitional care may play a role. {snip}<br>

<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s because black patients aren&rsquo;t that good about following their doctor&rsquo;s suggestions at the point of discharge from hospitalization.  Especially for heart attacks   &mdash;   Their list of to-dos and to-donts are going to be pretty long.</p>

<p>Perhaps an IQ test would help uncover the reason.</p>

		<p>Note that the readmission rates are not even that vastly different.  And every &#8220;study&#8221; that examines black health always concludes that lack of access to care causes the problems.  People are supposed to believe that blacks, a great many of who are urban, don&rsquo;t have free, low-cost, or even moderate-priced clinics and physicians&rsquo; offices accessible in big cities.  </p>

		<p>I bet they are not admitted/readmitted as often as ILLEGAL ALIENS are&hellip;I mean, when Juan is brought to the ER for gunshot or knife wounds the entire FN family gets check up and follow ups and of course, Juan is readmitted shortly after being release</p>

		<p>Articles like this always engage in some spin. This one implies that blacks are an underserved group, the care they get is second rate, and so on, all of which are false notions. The thing is to always imply someone else is to blame and to look for scapegoats. To say that blacks don&rsquo;t follow instructions and are often poor patients is something none of these supposed researchers would come out and say, or even to consider as a possibility. Instead, they just keep scratching their heads trying to solve this great mystery. On a side note, I&rsquo;d like to see a study of rates of malpractice lawsuits brought by blacks compared to whites (real whites, not the catch-all of the above study). I have a feeling it&rsquo;s higher as many try to hit the lawsuit lottery, attempting a ripoff of those doctors and hospitals that helped them.     </p>

		<p>The title of this article is &#8220;Blacks Readmitted to Hospital More Than Whites&#8221;, yet the White group included all non blacks including hispanics, asians, and native americans.</p>
<p>A more honest title for this article would have been &#8220;Blacks Readmitted to Hospital More Than Any Other Racial Group.&#8221; Unfortunately, everything must be framed in terms of black and White when dealing with these people.</p>

		<p>Anyone with half a brain can just look at blacks and realize that too many of them could careless about their health.  Obesity? About 70% of them fit that category.  Exercise? Go to any track or park, and they are a rarity.  Mental Health? Nothing is ever their fault. I&rsquo;m going into nursing, and quite frankly, I dread the prospect of having to care for people like them who behave like they don&rsquo;t have the slightest clue as to what does and doen&rsquo;t lead to good health&hellip;..</p>
