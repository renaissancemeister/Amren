			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carla Rivera, Los Angeles Times, February 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The struggles of black citizens in South Africa to overcome a brutal government-imposed system of race separation are right out of a history book to a student like Robert Virgen.</p>
<p>At 15, the Santee Education Complex sophomore hadn&rsquo;t been born when anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela was released from decades in prison or when the country held its first multiracial elections.</p>
<p>But when one of the heroes of that time, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, came to this downtown high school for a Black History Month celebration Thursday, Virgen said he felt a kinship that transcended time, geography and race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If the reception for Tutu was any indication, Virgen was not alone. The 79-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights activist beguiled an auditorium of about 1,000 students with tales of his childhood in South Africa, of being inspired by such Americans as Jackie Robinson and Lena Horne, and of the ongoing fight for human dignity based on character rather than skin color.</p>
<p>He also spoke about the importance of identifying role models, and he mentioned singer Michael Jackson, tennis great Arthur Ashe and actor Denzel Washington:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tutu mentioned the recent uprisings that toppled governments in Egypt and Tunisia, noting that many of the young protesters were inspired by the nonviolent civil disobedience of Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Finally, he asked the students to stand, wave their hands and chant: &#8220;I am a very special person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afterward, Adriana Bernabe, a Santee senior, said she was moved by the message that people can make a difference  &mdash;  just by being themselves.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The Santee event was cosponsored and filmed by DirecTV and will be offered this spring as a special educational broadcast to about 7,500 schools nationwide. The Crenshaw High Elite Choir sang and danced energetically, and jazz musician Herbie Hancock performed.</p>
<p>Other sponsors were Centric, a companion television network of BET, and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa&rsquo;s Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, which includes Santee. {snip}<br>

		<p>The struggles of black citizens in South Africa to overcome a brutal government-imposed system of race separation -</p>
<p>Ah yes, it was so brutal that millions of Africans from all over Africa moved there during that time. To them living with Whites under apartheid was better than living free with their fellow Africans. They always &#8220;forget&#8221; to tell that part.</p>
<p> Tell me &#8220;Tutu&#8221;, how have things improved for S.A. and the people of S.A. since the ending of apartheid!</p>
<p> -noting that many of the young protesters were inspired by the nonviolent civil disobedience of Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p> And just how would he know that? I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else, but I highly doubt these Muslims were thinking of MLK during their uprising.<br>

		<p>Exactly - now even tours to South Africa are dangerous and not worth the effort or the money.  My suggestion is that all whites stay OUT of Africa - it&rsquo;s a black continent, let&rsquo;s let them have it all to themselves and see how long it takes for them to become INcontinent&hellip;.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the FATHER of nonviolence was Ghandi in India - it wasn&rsquo;t MLK.  Ghandi was also a man of spirituality - he was a devout Hindu, practiced his religion devotedly, and was even regarded as a true guru (one who is one with God) by many.  MLK got his ideas about nonviolence from Ghandi, who was assassinated just like MLK was.  But, giving credit where credit is due is NOT something blacks are prone to doing, especially when the person who deserves the credit isn&rsquo;t black.</p>

<p>South Africa has become a lawless, corrupt state with SA&rsquo;s recent tenure on the UN Security Council a disappointing farce - they refused to censure Zimbabwe, North Korea, Libya and others for HUMAN RIGHTS abuses.(Short memory guys - you go on and on about the Apartheid &#8216;Regime&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>SA was far safer (for all races) before &#8216;Freedom&rsquo; in &#8216;92. Whenever blacks get into power - things go down.</p>
<p>Right now, in Johannesburg,we have a huge billing crisis.(municipal services). Reason: Yup, you guessed it-AA run company chosen to implement a new billing system. Lots of errors, HUGE cost overruns (more to come no doubt) - and Yup,you guessed it again, the black-run council says &#8216;there&rsquo;s no problem&rsquo;, and refuses to take responsibility, or be transparent about the problem.</p>

		<p>How is a black leader from Africa visiting America to celebrate black history month &ldquo;transcending race&rdquo;? Maybe we should first get a white history month in South-Africa and then let Jared Taylor visit a white school to celebrate &ldquo;white history month&rdquo; to transcend race.</p>

		<p>Tom Watson-the early 20th century southern politician and statesman-in his early career as a spokesman for the then burgeoning Populist Party, was a champion of black suffrage and a<br>
kind of pseudo equality. Midway through his career he did a complete about face and declared that America would become a &#8216;Haitian Hell&rsquo; if blacks ever gained political power through suffrage and equality. Ben Tillman of Caroline expressed similar points of view but was always a fervent opponent of equality and suffrage for blacks. It always puzzled me why white South Africans never fought back while their country was being taken over by the ANC. What happened in South Africa could happen here.    </p>

<p>If EVERYONE is &#8220;a very special person,&#8221; then no one is. </p>
<p>If everyone is equally special, then everyone is simultaneously equally UN-special. </p>
<p>If everyone is equally un-special, then everyone is equally ordinary and unremarkable. </p>
<p>Therefore, Tutu could have led those schoolchildren in a chant of &#8220;I am a very ordinary and unremarkable and boring person, worthy of no particular honor or even attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which would have been a lot closer to the truth. </p>

<p>For us that lived in the violent 1980&rsquo;s (State of Emergency), Bishop Tutu was a Marxist operative and Liberation Theologist disguised under the cloak of Theology so as to sell his ideology to the masses and make a laughing stock of the security forces and the government of the day. </p>
<p>There was an army of liberation theology priests under the same disguise let loose on the Christian population and that was a major cause for their downfall. After all who can doubt a Man of God and most are too stupid to see the hammer and sickle beneath the cloak, except the South African security forces of the time. There you have it.</p>

<p>Notice that the crimes Mandela committed (terrorism) are conveniently left out of this piece, but there&rsquo;s room for plenty of fluff. Yet when someone is a member or former member of a controversial white organization in this country, no matter how long ago and even though he committed no crimes, it is always mentioned. Even Jared Taylor while in Charlotte was recently called a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; in the MSM. </p>
<p>Of course, Mandela is never called a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; or a &#8220;black supremacist.&#8221; </p>
<p>More mendacity on the part of the MSM.</p>

		<p>Tutu often compares Israel to the former apartheid South Africa. This horrifies Hollywood liberals because they always placed him on a pedestal. How can Tutu be a victim and agree with some of David Duke&rsquo;s ideas? In almost every political situation, Hollywood is extremely left wing, except with Israel. Hollywood has a double standard when it comes to Israel and is extremely right wing with their politics. I imagine they are extremely disappointed with Tutu&rsquo;s candor. Furthermore, the current Marxist regime in South Africa forbids South African Jews from joining the Israeli Army. South African Jews often joined the Israeli army during apartheid years&hellip;I imagine they sympathized with their predicament. I wonder why Hollywood keeps quiet about this? They simply black out any unpleasant news from South Africa, but this must really puzzle them. </p>

		<p>Many a thought here&hellip;</p>
<p><i>The struggles of black citizens in South Africa to overcome a brutal government-imposed system of race separation are right out of a history book to a student like Robert Virgen.</i></p>
<p>Note the use of the word &#8220;brutal.&#8221;  Then compare the condition of life in White-run South Africa with that of black-run African countries (Congo, Uganda, Zimbabwe, etc.).  Which is the more &#8220;brutal?&#8221;</p>
<p>For that matter, is life in black run South Africa any less &#8220;brutal&#8221; than under apartheid?  Consider the violent crime, the farm attacks, the deterioration of standard of living, and all the rest which are detailed on blogs such as South Africa Sucks.  How many American or European anti-apartheid activists would be willing to migrate to the new SA?  I mean, why live in the terrible racist West when one can live in the rainbow nation of new SA?</p>
<p>As for &#8220;government-imposed system of race separation&#8221; this does not consider the reasons for it:  the various black ethnicities of South Africa had traditionally been at war with each other, as well as with the Whites.  Further, blacks had demonstrated during the de-colonialization era (the 1950s+) their inability to form stable, prosperous, democratic countries.  This would be obvious to all but liberal ideologues, liars and those who know nothing of history (we can imagine where Tutu and his audience fall in on this scale).</p>
<p>And of course, we might point out that blacks in America gain the advantages of &#8220;government-imposed system of race separation&#8221; in matters such as affirmative action, grants, business programs, ethnic studies departments, &#8220;hate&#8221; crime law protection, and all the rest. </p>
<p>Penultimately, we might ask what is Tutu&rsquo;s final objective in all of this?  To bring about a global revolution against the Western world? </p>
<p>And ultimately, we might ask what would happen if a school brought in a veteran of the Rhodesian armed forces and had him explain how he fought against African marxist terrorists, and then told Whites that they are special for bringing modern civilization to Africa.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes!  Santee High School, Pride of the LAUSD!</p>
<p>Troubled Santee High School has fashioned itself as a leader in the Social Justice &amp; Public Policy movement:</p>
<p><i> during the first weeks after Santee opened its doors, regular fights and a couple of riots broke out&hellip; When state testing time rolled around, Santee students scored the second lowest of any of the district&rsquo;s high schools. In the next testing period, they scored the lowest.</i></p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this public announcement from racist/La Raza activist/social studies teacher Ron Gochez:</p>
<p><i>Why is it that these people, these frail, racist, white people, want to keep us out of this country? </i></p>
<p>Gochez is busy this weekend disrupting police checkpoints that catch drunken, unlicensed mexican drivers claiming that the racist police &#8220;racially profile&#8221; mexicans stating: <i>The state of California shamefully profited $40 million from these checkpoints.</i></p>
<p>But, of all the inanity and insanity, shootings and scandal at Santee, here is the prize winner:</p>
<p> <i>The school&rsquo;s attendance boundaries include many of Los Angeles&rsquo; most violent neighborhoods, many students walk through more than fifty gang territories to get to school. Fights between students often occur.</i></p>
<p><i>In August, the students wrote letters to the mayor, asking for more protection for the area around their school.</i></p>
<p>Did hizhonor, the lame Mayor of LA, VivaLaRaza, vow to dedicate more law enforcement and INS agents to the violent area to crack down on gangs, many comprised of illegal aliens, so school children could walk safely to school and terrorized residents could live in peace ?  </p>
<p>Noooooooo</p>
<p>He decided the best course of action would be to re-route a bus serving Santee!</p>
<p><i>LAUSD Superintendent David Brewer and LA Mayor Villaraigosa rode the first bus going to Santee. While Brewer and Villaraigosa were on board the bus, a Los Angeles Times photographer snapped a photograph of a Santee 10th grader tagging a window of the bus.</i></p>
<p>Instead of declaring war on taggers who make all of LA look like a Third World barrio/ghetto, the mayor claimed: </p>
<p><i>the vandalism appeared to be a &#8216;cry for help&rsquo; by a troubled youth and said, &#8216;I&rsquo;m willing to mentor him personally!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>The principal, not to be out-done by the mayor:</p>
<p><i>said that the South Los Angeles school has a comprehensive team of people ready to help the boy, including three psychiatric social workers, one full-time and one part-time psychologist, two intensive intervention counselors and six regular school counselors&hellip; &#8216;he needs to be surrounded by people who are going to be nonjudgmental.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not kidding when I write that loser students without any redeeming qualities, those who should drop out or be kicked out, receive all the attention and services schools have to offer.</p>
<p>Trying to stay sane in a sea of insanity is becoming more difficult by the day.</p>

		<p>Tutu is a well-meaning but somewhat confused individual.</p>
<p>in a BBC interview, he describes saving a black man from being &#8220;necklaced&#8221; (beaten, tortured and then burned alive with a gasoline filled tire) by a black crowd during the struggle against apartheid.</p>
<p>large numbers of blacks were subjected to this treatment by the ANC during the anti-apartheid movement.</p>
<p>he drew no conclusions about this horrifying incident, it was an example of some things &#8220;just being wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>in his heart, Bishop Tutu knows full well that life for blacks was better under apartheid, that African blacks are centuries or even millennia away from the capacity for self-government, that South Africa under black rule has collapsed into a corrupt, violent, chaotic hellhole.</p>
<p>he also knows that if they were a white country next door with an open border, 100% of South African whites and 90% of its blacks would be long gone. </p>

They&rsquo;re doing the same thing in New Jersey. I was a fan of Gov. Christie until he appointed a Muslim to the Superior Court. He also appears to be in favor of amnesty to illegals.<br>
And of course there is the war on teachers that he&rsquo;s waging; blaming them for the failures of schools in Camden, Atlantic City, Newark and a host of other districts where Blacks predominate.<br>
As a retired teacher I&rsquo;m, saddened to hear that instead of reforming tenure to make it easier to dismiss incompetent teachers, they want to eliminate tenure completely and to base teachers&rsquo; careers on &ldquo;student achievement&rdquo;. That seems to be sweeping the country right now. Pennsylvania is heading in that direction as well; all because no one wants to admit what the REAL problem is and HAS BEEN particularly in the urban schools. Camden, Newark, NYC, LA, Miami, Milwaukee, Philadelphia ad infinitum et ad nauseum are all experiencing the same problems but it&rsquo;s politically incorrect to blame the &ldquo;students&rdquo;. How can any teacher cause &ldquo;students&rdquo; to achieve when they consistently cut school and when they ARE there they spend much of the time wandering the halls, hooking up with their friends and searching out copulation opportunities and when they&rsquo;re IN class they disrupt and all because teachers fear them on the physical level and also fear being labeled racist. We attribute their often bizzare behavior to &ldquo;cultural differences&rdquo; and no attempt is made toward behavior modification.</p>
<p>I compared my bathroom sign in sheet with another teacher&rsquo;s who for the last two years had bathroom duty that came either the period before mine and the period after. There were lots of duplications of the same &ldquo;students&rdquo;. One could infer that that these people played this game all through the day.<br>
In my 44 years in education I never met a teacher who went into class with an Asian lesson plan, a Black lesson plan, an Hispanic lesson plan and a White lesson plan. Every kid at my school has an equal opportunity to be educated and there are some groups mainly Black and some Wannabe Hispanics who consistently reject it and have been for the last 50 years since LBJ&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Society&rdquo; began.<br>
So now, rather than admit that a half century of set asides, social programs, Head Start, and tens of thousands of dollars per student sent down a rat hole has been a failure, we&rsquo;ll now attack the teachers. They&rsquo;re an easy target because they&rsquo;ve been so hamstrung by PC that they&rsquo;re won&rsquo;t risk defending themselves because that would entail their identifying the problem. That would be an instant career killer. <br>
A so called education expert in Philly complained about young teachers going into &ldquo;Inner City&rdquo; schools and then &rdquo; move on&rdquo; after a couple of years. DUUUHHHH!!! Better to WALK out than to be carried.<br>
At South Philadelphia High School Asian students were being randomly attacked and beaten, some severely enough to warrant hospitalization, by groups of &ldquo;youths&rdquo;. Reporters made sure to mention that the victims were all Asian but avoided mentioning the ethnicity of the attackers. No need to, really. &ldquo;Youths&rdquo; has become a code word for Black thugs.<br>
Emile Zola said &rdquo; If you hide the truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow and gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts forth it will blow up everything in its path&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m still waiting for that day but in the meantime let&rsquo;s drive teachers out of education. Imagine having your career based on &rdquo; achievement&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re dealing with a group, the majority of which hasn&rsquo;t a scintilla of a desire to &ldquo;achieve&rdquo; anything other than mayhem.</p>

		<p>One of the frauds that Bishop Tutu perpetrates on his ignorant, naive and gullible audiences outside of South Africa is to extoll the virtues of the black concept of brotherly love and compassion for their own kind known as &#8220;Ubuntu&#8221;</p>
<p>The physical manifestation of this philosophy  can be verified on www.nationmaster.com where the true horror of South Africa&rsquo;s crime statistics are revealed.</p>
<p>In round figures since &#8216;freedom&#8221; (fully democratic election and black majority rule) in 1994 the ANC government admits to an average murder rate of 50/day. Interpol maintain that the death rate is higher. Let us accept a compromise of 20,000/year. Over 16 years this adds up to 320,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Now here is the kicker. <br>
Conservatively 87% of those victims = 280,000 <br>
are the result of black on black violence.<br>
So much for brotherly love amongst black people<br>
The remaining 40,000 deaths are the result of black on white violence</p>
<p>Compare that to the death rate in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and you will see that fully democratic South Africa in peace time is more dangerously violent than a full on war zone in the middle east</p>
<p>Peculiarly, in none of his speeches has Bishop Tutu specifically spoken out against either the black on black violence or the black on white violence which is significantly higher than what took place during the 42 apartheid years</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>DURING THE APARTHEID ERA<br>
74 PEOPLE DIED IN POLICE CUSTODY IN 25 YEARS<br>
SINCE DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL STARTED IN 1963</p>
<p><br>
IN THE NEW SOUTH AFRICA<br>
566 DEATHS<br>
IN POLICE CUSTODY HAVE OCCURRED<br>
IN ONE YEAR (2010) ALONE!</p>

WHERE IS THE WORLDWIDE OUTCRY NOW?<br>
