<p>Jose Elias Zaiter-Pou [a Dominican], 62, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston following a government sting operation in which he met with an informant in a Woburn hotel and agreed to surgically alter the informant&rsquo;s fingerprints in exchange for $4,500, US District Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said in a statement.</p>
<p>Luz Martinez-LeBron, 42, of Puerto Rico, and Ricky Baez-Cruz, 29, of the Dominican Republic, were also charged in the scheme, according to Christina DiIorio-Sterling, the US attorney&rsquo;s spokeswoman.</p>
<p>During the July meeting at the Red Roof Inn, secretly audio- and videorecorded by law enforcement officials, Zaiter-Pou described to the informant how he would surgically remove a portion of the fingerprint and then suture the tip back, resulting in a new, unrecognizable print, Ortiz said. Zaiter-Pou brought surgical equipment, as well as antibiotics and drugs for anesthesia to the hotel, she said. During the meeting, the informant stated a desire to have the procedure performed to avoid jail and deportation, according to court documents.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Martinez-LeBron contacted potential clients and worked with Zaiter-Pou to set up meetings where the doctor would perform the surgery. Baez-Cruz, a former client of Zaiter-Pou&rsquo;s who underwent the fingerprint surgery, attended meetings to give testimonial about the procedure&rsquo;s success, the documents said.</p>
<p>US District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced Zaiter-Pou to 12 months and one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Woodlock also ordered Zaiter-Pou deported to the Dominican Republic after he serves his time, Ortiz said.</p>

		<p>I hardly think this scheme is new.  I&rsquo;ve heard of it being practiced in Mexico long before this.  Some people will go to any lengths to avoid the consequences of their actions&hellip;.</p>

<p>Nothing but a slap on el wristo.  This conniving quack will be out in three months, paroled in six and will be back in the US by this time next year.</p>

<p>2008 Taxpayer Cost<br/>
Taxpayers paid 37% higher than the other states per inmate in 2008.</p>
<p>                  Massachusetts  National Avg.  <br/>
Cost Per Inmate (2008)  $45,954  $28,771  </p>
<p>http://goo.gl/L0qng</p>
<p>Only Alaska, California, Rhode Island, Vermont and New York have higher inmate housing fees.</p>
<p>Strip the good doctor&rsquo;s license to practice anywhere on the planet, assess his bank account for the next ten years _in the Dominican Republic_.  And send him home.</p>
<p>WHY PAY TEN TO ONE TO FEED AND HOUSE THIS PERSON FOR A 4,500 DOLLAR CRIME?!?!?!</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 62 years old, assuming he survives prison, nothing he does by way of restitution during his probation will make up the difference of housing him for &#8216;12 months and a day&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Make him poor.  Send him home.</p>

		<p>I can remember reading a long time ago about American criminals that did the same. But just moved the outer skin from one finger to another and did so BY THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY ANESTHETIC! Put rubber bands on the finger first joints until they were blue and then cut with a razor and moved the outer flesh and skin from one finger to another.</p>
<p>OH MY!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m constantly amazed at the criminal mind of these people. Instead of figuring out how they can remedy the ills of their own countries, they spend time on elaborate criminal<br/>
schemes to outwit the law here. It&rsquo;s almost like a game. They have inherited the mindset of the corrupt places from which they come and are happy to outwit any authority or obey any laws. They feel entitled to the goods of this country and will stop at nothing to get them. The saddest part is, they are aided and abetted by out own government. </p>
