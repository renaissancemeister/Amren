			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Truth Shall Set You Free (blog), February 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The ideal of an integrated society is dying, and racist blacks are the ones pounding nails into its coffin. What is the point in having jury trials when racist blacks refuse to convict? It makes a mockery of justice, and is leading to a logical and justified backlash against the inclusion of common blacks in the justice system.</p>
<p>Curtis Vance stands as a poster boy for all that is sick and wrong with black society today. Vance is famous for the brutal and sadistic murder of beautiful blonde TV anchor woman Anne Pressly. Pressly died hours after being raped and beaten. The official cause of death was that her jawbone was fully dislocated and crushed back against her jugular, which constricted blood flow to her brain. Her entire face and head was smashed to mush in the attack.</p>
<p>Curtis was living with his girlfriend and three kids at the time. The girlfriend&rsquo;s mother said, &#8220;he has a real nice personality. He didn&rsquo;t give me no kind of hint or nothing. It shocked me, I don&rsquo;t want to believe he did something like that.&#8221; (http://csafd.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=andreanance&action;=display&thread;=2627&page;=2). Raping women in the early morning was apparently just his hobby. He wandered through target neighborhoods ahead of time, pretending to look for work, casing the houses for victims (http://www.fox16.com/mostpopular/story/Vance-spotted-in-Heights-3-days-before-Pressly/6PJ_zbplEESxYxnjw8A50g.cspx).</p>
<p>Kristin Edwards was raped by Vance a few months before his attack on Pressly. Her saving grace appears to have been her passivity. Edwards did not attempt to fight, which apparently kept her alive, as Vance did indeed threaten to kill her. Ironically, it was his rape of Edwards that led to his identification as Pressly&rsquo;s attacker. After finding the DNA match to the unsolved Edwards rape, police in Little Rock got a tip to investigate Vance from the detective in the small town (Marianna) where Edwards lived at the time of the rape.</p>
<p><b>Rape Mistrial and Black Racism</b></p>
<p>Vance was convicted of the murder of Pressly, and the DNA match pinned him as the rapist of Edwards, so he went on trial on the rape charge this week. Vance was identified as Edward&rsquo;s attacker by DNA match, the victim&rsquo;s direct testimony, and the accused&rsquo;s own confession. Yet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>After merely THREE HOURS of deliberation, the judge agreed to a mistrial, as 7 of the jurors refused to convict. Neither the prosecuting attorney nor the judge had any hope that the jury would agree on basic facts, or could be persuaded by reason. After a mere three hours, they just agreed to drop the trial.</p>
<p>The reason: the racist blacks on the jury. It has been confirmed that the composition of the jury was 7 blacks and 5 whites (http://www.fox16.com/news/local/story/Pressly-killer-rape-trial-ends-in-mistrial-jury/98WRVqFwF0G1p-pt7-7exQ.cspx).</p>
<p>The irrational anti-white hatred of black jurors is not even a secret any more, and is acknowledged as widespread. Prosecuting attorneys know it, and openly counsel their clients to expect it. Edwards said mistrial was exactly what she had expected to happened, because she was forewarned by her attorney that her race, the race of the attacker, and the race of the jury would lead to the jury refusing to convict. See Edwards&rsquo; detailed interview here: http://www.katv.com/global/category.asp?c=189703&clipId;=5532062</p>
<p>They are actually dismissing the case, not bothering to take it to another trial. Edwards says she does not want to go through the whole process again, when she would most likely face the same verdict, i.e., facing a jury of racist blacks who refuse to convict. When you are a white victim, why bother?</p>
<p>I find it quite indicative that national news reports are not mentioning the race angle, such as here http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110203/ap_on_re_us/us_tv_anchor_attacked. As usual, the national media views it as their job to misinform, to make sure their audience is NOT getting the full story. Only when you dig down into the story on the local reporting do we see the issue of race being discussed. </p>
<p><b>Larger Social Implications</b></p>
<p>The refusal of blacks to convict other blacks, even heinous inhuman murderers like Vance, even in the face of overwhelming physical and eyewitness testimony, even combined with a previous confession, calls into question the ability of blacks to serve on juries. </p>
<p>Black street criminals are fully aware of their immunity to jury conviction. If blacks know that crimes against whites will be ignored by juries, even with full proof, it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to see how this would affect an increase in their criminal behavior.</p>
<p>When justice is not to be found in the legal system, where exactly are whites expected to turn? Whites cannot be expected to tolerate this type of situation long.<br>

<p>Whites have been tolerating this situation for quite some time, and I suspect it will be a long time before most wake up.  Most still get their news from the very same mass media that always covers these cases up.<br>

		<p>Blacks are so unapologetically racist that I&rsquo;m honestly surprised that the state was able to get a murder conviction against Vance to begin with. </p>
<p>Baltimore and other black majority cities have resorted to plea deals in 95 percent of cases because prosecutors know that black juries will rarely convict black criminals when the victim is black and never when the victim is white.</p>
<p>The next time the media tries to foster pity for some black criminal that was convicted by an &#8220;all white jury&#8221; keep this article in mind.  </p>

		<p>I wish more people could visit Marianna, AR where this trial occurred.  Those people live in another reality.  You would miss the worst urban environment and think it civil if you stayed there long. </p>
<p>Another thing needs to be mentioned about this case.  MS. Edwards was part of a program that takes college kids from all over the country and pays their student loans in exchange for them agreeing to teach for a time in this pit of hell. I am sure they come in full of liberal sentiments and I am equally sure they leave with a different outlook.  This case reminds me of the rapes in the peace corps that they don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>The Orange Taylor case in East Lansing was even worse than this one if you can imagine it.  His defense was that he found the body of Ms. Dickinson already dead in her dorm room that he broke into and merely decided to masturbate on her dead body.  Mistrial again.</p>
<p>When the prosecuting attorney announced that he would be tried again the good people there formed a protest march.</p>
<p>How much does it take to get people motivated?  How much more?</p>

		<p>Sounds a lot like the situation whites found themselves in during post Civil War Reconstruction.  The result was, they took things back into their own hands, and started meting out revenge-motivated justice.  If the Powers That Be don&rsquo;t start understanding white frustration, it will happen again.  I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s right   &mdash;   but it IS very understandable.  We made such a HUGE mistake with the giveaway programs of the &#8216;60&rsquo;s - we created a nation of dependent poor blacks, which morphed into a nation of entitlement-consciousness poor blacks, who are as ill-equipped as ever to take responsibility for their own lives and livelihoods.  It&rsquo;s just gonna get more of them killed; and, paradoxically, their own people kill more of them than any other race does.  Universal justice does exist in some fashion.</p>

		<p>Some things that come to mind:</p>
<p>1.  Feminism elevates our women and separates them from our men without changing any of the physical mandates or limitations of being female (average 52% of upper body strength, 66% of lower body strength, one womb).  If living alone means being without encumbrance, it also means that we are fragmenting as a viable racial group.  Other groups, less &#8216;exploratory&rsquo; in their gender role identities, may take that fragmentive weakness as an invitation to hasten the extinction process along.  And solitary, white, middle aged, women are the first in line.</p>
<p>2.  The second inauguration of the K occurred in 1913 during period of high immigration, and low judicial mores when a likely innocent Leo Frank was seized and lynched after having his murder sentence commuted from death to life in prison.  While I think the K have made themselves untenable as political symbols of oppression, it is entirely possible that racially realistic communities could organize around a new banner to _gate themselves_ behind something more akin to say the Guardian Angels system.  Some form of nationalist/realist group think does need to happen here, if only to get some funds together, quickly, if we are to truly be safe in &#8216;majority neighborhood, minority nation&rsquo; existence.</p>
<p>If only because that term can only apply if the real estate property itself is held in communal trust so that, when people sell homes, it is between friends and not subject to external oversight.</p>
<p>3.  As a further means to reinvest ourselves in our communities as our group, I would like to see a system invented whereby fixed maintenance fees could be allocated to youth groups (children of the residents or younger renters) to do things like lawn mowing, painting and gutter cleaning for considerable profit.  Taking away threat-ethny economic opportunity and bringing back home to incentivize whites to help each other.  This would include equipment fees to stand up the service and perhaps a vehicle to export it when the children were old enough.  Such a service could eventually extend to all elements of the day to day living, including grocery purchases and delivery and overall &#8216;How&rsquo;re ya doin?&rsquo; checks on the elderly and live-alones.  It is despicable that all door were locked to this woman in her time of need.</p>
<p>4.  Let&rsquo;s talk honestly about wiring up the neighborhood so that multiple perspective, digital-HD video, surveillance of pedestrians and vehicles are available, 24:7.  Both inside the gate and along it&rsquo;s approaches (since fence jumpers will most likely exit from pull-up vehicles).  Let&rsquo;s also offer small arms training and home security system group-buy and upgrade benefits to those of our people who pass a background check.  If we make the evidence dense (license plates _really_ help, so does biometrically precise measurements and shots of specific items of unique clothing) and if we provide a severe disincentive (How do I reload this thing?) to the attempt itself, we can push this right to the edge in terms of forcing a hostile judiciary and indifferent police to either _do their jobs_ protecting us.  Or get out of our way when we finally have no choice but to separate from their authority and constitute a separate governing body for ourselves.</p>
<p>I cannot understate the last.  The last time we had to reinvent ourselves, it was on the simple basis of taxation without representation.  If it comes time to do it again, we will have to show that &#8216;representation&rsquo; is no longer enough when it is corrupted by interests not conducive to our own harmony.  Evidence people.  We need evidence of the failure of government to protect our interests and our posterity.  And it&rsquo;s overweening interference with our attempts to live apart from it&rsquo;s undue influence.</p>

		<p>Ray Lewis, star linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens was present at an after hours Superbowl party when 2 people were stabbed to death. Two members of his entourage were charged with the murder. Lewis, who was a witness and knew the accused, testified against the two defendants. The jury didn&rsquo;t convict them. This was a &#8216;black on black&rsquo; crime but one wonders if &#8216;jury nullification&rsquo; had something to do with it. An NFL football player and his friends are extra-black and part of those giving back to the community. </p>

		<p> Prosecuting attorneys, fully aware of this propensity of blacks to refuse to convict their own when a White is the victim, have a duty to exclude as many blacks from the juries as possible by using their right to remove potential jurors during voir dire, or jury selection. If challenged on appeal in the case of convictions, they should point out that defense attorneys use those same rights to remove White jurors when the defendant is black and the victim White.</p>
<p> Why on earth should there have been a jury of seven blacks and five Whites in the Vance case? Was the prosecutor so naive or incompetent that he wasn&rsquo;t aware of the almost-certain outcome with such a jury composition?</p>
<p> And that case most certainly should have been re-tried, this time with more care to keeping as many blacks as possible off the jury. Blacks and White liberals bemoaned the acquittal of Klansmen and others by &#8220;all-White&#8221; Southern juries back in the 1960s. If those acquittals were tainted by racial bias, then what pray tell is a verdict like that in the Vance case?</p>

<p>Oh, no, you see, this is exactly what blacks had in mind with regards to integration. This is exactly what integration means. And it is exactly what will continue to happen, with ever greater outrages, if we allow ourselves to become a minority in this country. Not that you&rsquo;ll hear that from anyone in the MSM, or even most of the alternative media, though it certainly takes uncommon bravery to criticize anything that blacks do with regards to the justice system.</p>

		<p>Blacks do not and have never done much other than complain to increase their lot in society. I see people come from all over the world with no red carpet rolled out for them who seize the American dream and within a few years become great and productive Americans. Blacks did not revolt to get their freedom. It Was Given To Them and the giving is always expected and never seems to stop.</p>
<p>My point is this: whites baby and coddle blacks letting them rise to positions they are absolutely not qualified for and then the whites cry. Blacks didn&rsquo;t earn or take blacks were served up everything they have by whites on silver platters.</p>
<p>Until whites stop pretending to be so accepting the problem can only grow worse.</p>

		<p>This would not happen in San Francisco. When I report for jury duty in the city of &#8220;diversity&#8221; there are usually no blacks in the jury pool. The usual makeup is 40% White, 40% Asian and 20% Latino. Most of the jurors are well dressed and obviously employed and professional. The most blacks I ever saw was three. I often thought that a black person would have trouble getting a trial by a jury of their &#8220;peers&#8221; in San Francisco. It doesn&rsquo;t take much to figure out what lists are used to get jurors names.</p>

<p>Of course. When a race of people have as biased a view of themselves and others as blacks, how can you ever expect them to serve as impartial jurors on a trial? You can&rsquo;t. Look at the whole &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement, which was all about blaming one race (whites) for the problems of another (blacks). How many blacks spoke out against the injustice of this? Very few.</p>
<p>Also, I find it refreshing that two stories today have referred to blacks themselves as racist. Perhaps this is what will cause this word to finally crumble  &mdash;  the using of it on those whom it was originally designed to protect!</p>

<p>Other than murder or rape, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to believe that blacks should be arrested and jailed for anything. He think the community could do a better job of rehabilitation troubled youth.</p>
<p>This is a major reason black crime is  out of control. Blacks don&rsquo;t have the IQ to understand what criminals do to their community. Whites don&rsquo;t stand for it. Blacks do.</p>

		<p>My questions are very simple.  How are we, as Whites, going to extricate ourselves from this dilemma and this rapidly closing trap?  Whites are being intimidated more and more into silence. They can&rsquo;t respond to Blacks on the micro level in just every day dealings with them because they fear the racist label.  They further can&rsquo;t respond because as we become more and more passive they become more and more aggressive; Appeasement tends to make the aggressor more aggressive in some cases, and especially in this one.  This fear of looking racist isn&rsquo;t all either.  White men are becoming more passive both verbally and physically when confronted with Blacks.  They&rsquo;re not only afraid of the label &#8220;racist&#8221;, but they&rsquo;re afraid of a physical confrontation with a Black, because they&rsquo;ve been conditioned to feel guilt for past wrongs and also because they&rsquo;ve been conditioned by the major media to believe that Blacks are superior to Whites physically.  When we refuse to respond either verbally or physically, and we&rsquo;re the victims of crimes perpetrated by Blacks that racist Black juries refuse to convict, what choice is left but racial suicide.  This is what is happening right now, and most Whites are in a serious case of denial about it.</p>

		<p>This does not come as shocking news to any race realist here at AmRen. What will be shocking is when main stream media starts reporting the fact that blacks hate whites so bad they will not even convict a black for a brutal murder of a white person (O.J. Simpson case, anyone? - remember how all those fine, wonderful black people cheered?).</p>
<p>Main stream media is so complicit in this, I have lost nearly all respect for them. Any black on white crime they bury as deep as possible. But they&rsquo;re right there to report on groveling, pandering whites willing to forgive all manor of sick, perverted crime committed against them by blacks. MSM will fall all over themselves to report on that. Or report on a white person using the &#8220;N&#8221; word on a black. Considering blacks attitude and behavior towards white people, calling them the &#8220;N&#8221; word is being charitable - not nearly profane enough.</p>

		<p>My liberal friends STILL think that the lesson of the OJ trial was that &#8220;rich people can get away with anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you point out that this was jury nullification &amp; the votes broke down on race lines (with one older black man voting guilty despite threats and intimidation, god bless him), that Marcia Clark later admitted to catastrophic miscalculation (she actually believed black women would identify with a white female victim: can you imagine?) they stare in confusion:</p>
<p>Why have you become a racist??</p>
<p>Blacks are fully aware of jury nullification, they discuss it ad nauseam on their blogs &amp; websites, but most whites are still walking around comatose.</p>

		<p>The strongest implication of this story - which apparently represents a general trend - is that the jury system must now be regarded as unreliable, and an alternative system of justice, as found in continental Europe, for example.<br>
  Yes, I can hear the screams of protest already, blah, blah, blah, &#8216;the bedrock of justice&rsquo; etc etc.But we must remember that the &#8216;jury of peers&rsquo; evolved hundreds of years ago in Anglo-Saxon England at a time when &#8216;peers&rsquo; actually meant &#8216;peers&rsquo; ie there was no substantial distinction between the members of the jury and the accused, the jury was dispassionate and disinterested, only concerned with determining the &#8216;truth&rsquo;.<br>
   This is absolutely not the case with the modern USA.Blacks moan incessantly if Whites even deign to judge them, and as this case shows, blacks, generally only care about &#8216;saving *their* people&rsquo;, rather than any notion of &#8216;justice&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The outrageous OJ trial opened my eyes to the reality of jury nullification. I never trusted juries, which are often made up of biased, prejudicial, or stupid people, who are definitely not my peers. Whenever blacks are heavily represented in a jury, the outcome is inevitable if the defendant is also black. Perhaps a neutral computer could decide guilt or innocence based solely on the facts, not race. </p>

		<p>Years ago, a strange black man lurking around a white or upscale neighborhood would have been severely questioned, told to leave, or shuttled off by the police.  Now, too many people are afraid of appearing to be politically incorrect or insensitive, so nothing is done.<br>
People of any means should live in well-guarded communities.  If whites don&rsquo;t have the means, they should seek an all-white neighborhood where strange non-whites are not tolerated.</p>

		<p>So, if a case such as this is re-tried with more whites and less blacks on the jury, and a conviction is the result, what happens?  How long before every neighborhood in that city is on fire?  How many other deaths, rapes, and beatings will occur during the riots?  Riots will definately occur if a defendant is aquitted once and re-tried with a conviction, no matter what the evidence.  I&rsquo;m sad to say it&rsquo;s lose-lose at that point.  It&rsquo;s crucial the job is done right the first time, but that&rsquo;s becoming impossible.  Once again the real answers can&rsquo;t be talked about. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The next time the media tries to foster pity for some black criminal that was convicted by an &ldquo;all white jury&rdquo; keep this article in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites have been bamboozled for a long, long time.  The South was vilified - and we all bought into it - when most of the oppression/separation was justified because the vast majority of blacks has a criminal tendency (and have since their arrival on these shores) and the remaining blacks do nothing about it including a lack of condemning it!  Look at real southern history and you&rsquo;ll realize how much things are twisted.  All we saw were the firehoses being used against docile blacks but the truth is they were urinating in the streets and fornicating with northern white hippies on the courthouse steps in Birmingham.  Yes, the media was playing propaganda back then, too.</p>
<p>I know this may be difficult but Pressly&rsquo;s family should have released photos of the brutality.  Emmett Till&rsquo;s mother had an open casket for shock value and it was very successful in aiding the anti-southern white movement.  And, I think Pressly&rsquo;s case would garnered far more shock value since she wasn&rsquo;t in water for a week.  These are the things we need to do to bring reality to what is really going on.  And, we better put aside the immaturity if we want to survive!  </p>
<p>The victors white history.  All whites are held accountable for the actions of a few whites.  Another uneven playing field when it comes to other races.<br>

<p>How many black juries would convict of white person of a crime no matter how flimsy the evidence?</p>
<p>The Duke Lacrosse story was an obviously hoax but who knows what would have happened if it when to trial.</p>
<p>Duke Univ. is located in Durham, N.C. As I understand it 50% of Durham is black. Depending on the jury the Lacrosse players could have been sent away a long time.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t look for a white backlash in this country against the rank stupidity and anti-white hatred and pro-black biases of blacks.  The nation has been pounded into submission by white guilt and politically correct dogma, and it will take a black on white killing spree, nationally, to wake most of them up.  And then there will be a large portion who will want to make amends, hold hands, and burn some candles.  Short of that they&rsquo;ll continue to sit on their couches watching Oprah and football, sipping Budweiser.</p>
<p>The Egyptian, Tunisian, Jordon, Moroccan riots, prompted by heavy handed government control, and runaway food and energy costs, are predicted by many high profile types to be soon spreading into Europe, especially Greece, Spain, England and France, but the US is forecast to stay docile by these same experts, because it is believed most US citizens don&rsquo;t have the stomach for fighting back.</p>
<p>When I think about how whites are pushed around by blacks and other non-whites, in addition to the out and out brutality of TSA gropings and other liberty infringements, I agree with that assessment.</p>

		<p>Blacks can&rsquo;t function in Western civilization.  All of our institutions and customs, like our justice system, was developed over thousands of years for civilized White Christians.  It just doesn&rsquo;t work for blacks.  Take, for example, the use of prison as punishment.  For your average white man, who naturally yearns to be free and independent, prison is almost a nightmare situation.  For your average black, prison is a vacation where he gets three hots and a cot, free medical, free education, free legal services, free cable TV, free use of fully equipped gym and all sort of recreations. He gets to hang with his homies all day and can get all the drugs and down low sex he desires. Life for him on the inside is not that much different on the streets except that all his needs for by the taxpayers.  The answer for the Whites who seek justice in the court is to not go into areas where Blacks are the majority on juries because you have left the boundaries of American civilization.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, plea deals are a two way street.  Each side has to give up something to get something.  The prosecution concedes some of the charges (if there are multiple), or the death penalty (if Murder 1 is in the mix), or a prison sentence on the high end of the legally permitted range, in exchange for a guaranteed guilty verdict.  The defendant concedes guilt in exchange for a shorter bid, or no death penalty, as the case may be.  Plea deals can only work if the defendant thinks that a jury could convict him.</p>
<p>Once Baltimore&rsquo;s blacks, or any other blacks, are convinced that a jury would never convict them, then plea deals are no longer, and the CJ system grinds to a turtle-slow pace.</p>

		<p>What confuses me more than anything in this time, is how memories of white people can be so selective. It was a time in this country when a Black person wouldn&rsquo;t even see a trial much less justice. Mobs would convict on race alone. Now I see a little bitter pill swallowing is very hard for the white people. If you treat people like dogs don&rsquo;t you think that will come back on you at some point? It is my view that white folk who think they are victims now, are about to learn what real victimhood is. I just see it as chickens coming home to roost.</p>

		<p>Most whites have been taught by society that if you mention this type of black racism it makes you, the white, a racist.  Likewise, the media will never report this type of obvious outrage because they do not want to be labeled as &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>
<p>What to do?  Print a couple copies of this article, and the comments, and let it lay around at offices, stores, doctors offices, and anywhere someone might casually pick it up and read it.  Eventually some guilt-ridden white will throw it away, but others might read it and silently wake up.</p>

		<p>Another strategy that we need to use is the boycott of any product whose ads. degrade White people. I saw one yesterday ( I think it was for Doritos) that was absolutely nauseating. They&rsquo;re getting more and more blatant about how they insult White men and portray White women with Blacks.<br>
I was in a Target store in S. Florida this week and the pictorial advertisements throughout the store might suggest that there are NO Whites left in the USA. The ironic thing was that the majority of the shoppers in the store where White. I engaged another shopper in conversation and mentioned my observation regarding the ads.  All I got in the way of a response was a shoulder shrug and a &#8220;Whaddaya gonna do?&#8221; </p>
<p>I personally am  going to email the customer relations dept. of any company whose ads. I find insulting and let them know that I will NOT purchase their products. IF every AMREN reader would do likewise, we could start a movement that might have some impact especially in these tough economic times when retailers are clamoring to attract buyers.</p>

		<p>For those of you who say whites are passively &#8220;taking it,&#8221; I submit that the &#8220;castle doctrine&#8221; and &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; laws recently enacted in many states are a direct result of the black judicial sabotage revealed in this article. Legislators realized that white victims of black criminals are now at a huge disadvantage in the court system and have empowered them to effectively bypass that system by putting the law on their side when they fight back. No longer do whites in these states have any &#8220;duty to retreat&#8221; in the face of aggression from black thugs. Nor can they be sued by the thugs or their families for daring to defend themselves. The Florida self-defense law (enacted in 2005) is one of the best in the nation:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4gqap25" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/4gqap25</a></p>
<p>Another trend making the rounds is charging every co-conspirator of a crime involving loss of life with first-degree murder, <i>regardless of who was killed.</i> So if Antwan and Jamal decide to rob a store or burglarize a home and the intended victim gives Jamal a terminal case of lead poisoning, it&rsquo;s Murder-1 for Antwan, even if his only role was to drive the getaway car.</p>
<p>Of course, these laws are 100% race-neutral, so a black victim has the same right to use deadly force in self-defense as a white. But wherever they have been passed it&rsquo;s been over the stuck-pig squealing of the entire black caucus, for the obvious reasons.</p>

<p>You seem to be motivated by pure vindictiveness and revenge, you unashamedly say that you want to wreak &#8216;revenge&rsquo; on whites.Whites who foolishly voted for &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; and bestowing privileges upon blacks should have taken more heed of people like you with opinions like yours.If a large portion of the black population thinks like you, then America whites should never, ever have even countenanced &#8216;integration&rsquo; - as it is obvious that people like you cannot be regarded as &#8216;peers&rsquo;, but have a wish to destroy the society into which you were foolishly accepted into from within.</p>

		<p>To hear it from the current revisionist history, black lynchings were the result of drooling white racists who just randomly strung up innocent blacks. One writer who bothered to look back into some lynchings where he could find the news reports, police reports, etc to get a well-rounded picture found that those tended to be blacks who had committed crimes against whites that were either heinous or had gone to court and not gotten a stiff sentence.</p>

		<p>To Tyrone Mixon:</p>
<p>Like a lot of white people, I had nothing but good will toward blacks my entire (five-plus decades) life, and have done more for and on behalf of black people (still do) in various capacities than just about any other person, black or white, I know.  Been doing this for decades.  But I have lost virtually all respect for black people as a race. I believe that character is something possessed by groups as well as individuals, and I have seen the character of the African-American race or ethnic group, or however you want to categorize, decline in the last 35-40 years.  As a group, their expectation of what they are entitled to has expanded, their sense of victimhood, grievance and vindictiveness has increased exponentially, and their behavior and standards as a group as a group has declined, in virtually every area.  As one person I know stated:  &#8220;They never fail to disappoint.&#8221;  I have been waiting - hoping - for the African-American population to get their act together.  They haven&rsquo;t. You hate America - leave.  You hate white people - go somewhere with a majority black population.  Some of your ancestors may have been &#8220;treated like dogs,&#8221; but in my lifetime,<br>
blacks have been officially favored over whites.   And as to whites learning what &#8220;real victimhood&#8221; is, we are not a whining, complaining, bitter, childish race expecting others to make things better, and taking it out on innocent people when life gets difficult.  We are the ones that made this country and this world a better place for our efforts and existence. I, for one, am no longer willing to give you a pass for less than human actions.</p>
