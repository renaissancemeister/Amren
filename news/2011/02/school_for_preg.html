			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jon Swaine, Telegraph (London), February 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New Directions high school would teach 300 boys and girls while also providing free childcare for their sons and daughters.</p>
<p>The charter school would receive public funding, in a similar set-up to the &#8220;free&#8221; schools being developed in Britain. It would be run by a group of pastors and teachers in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.</p>
<p>According to the school&rsquo;s prospectus, its teachers will aim to develop &#8220;self-confidence and worth&#8221; in young parents, while promoting &#8220;critical thinking skills that will open the door for positive life choices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An all-inclusive high school for pregnant and parenting teens will eliminate barriers to completing high school education,&#8221; said the school&rsquo;s founders, who are led by Jacquelyn Wideman, a charity consultant.</p>
<p>The school will also &#8220;eliminate stigma and judgmental attitudes associated with those that are pregnant and in school,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>There are 77 pregnancies a year per 1,000 teenage girls in New York, according to the latest available figures, compared to 70 per 1,000 teenage girls around the United States.</p>
<p>The proposed school is, however, opposed by other groups who work with teenage parents in the area, including the Brooklyn Young Mothers&rsquo; Collective.</p>
<p>Aisha Dominique, a coordinator for the group, suggested it was against the spirit, if not the letter, of Brown vs Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education should be shared,&#8221; Ms Dominique told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Separate is not equal, and the job of schools is to give a good quality education to all.</p>
<p>&#8220;New York city rules state that pregnant and parenting pupils must be allowed in schools, and in that sense we believe that they are best served in the existing public schools system.&#8221;</p>

		<p>No effort should be made to eliminate stigma. As a result of volition they choose to become public leeches (tax consumers, not tax-payers).  That is a shame (stigma worthy). We should no longer treat them as victims of an accident.  No section 8 housing, no food stamps.  If their families, or their babies daddy can&rsquo;t come up with the funds, send them to the county work-farms, where they can work to feed their spawn.  Except for start-up costs, these farms should be self-supporting, with no endless funding from the tax-payer.</p>

		<p>This is old news.</p>
<p>A decade ago, my parents went to a reunion at their old Chicago-area high school. They found it had a day care center for the children of students.</p>
<p>Although there were a few blacks in the school when they attended in the mid 1930&rsquo;s, it is now an all black school.</p>

		<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1.  Where is there &#8220;stigma&#8221; anymore about expecting teenage girls and young women?  The days of &#8220;sending her away for nine months&#8221; are over.  Now, we have whole MTV sitcoms glorifying teenage motherhood.</p>
<p>2.  Boys and young men will be allowed to attend this school for expecting mothers?  I didn&rsquo;t know that was biologically possible.  Yeah, I know, sea horses, but the fertilization is done inside the mother and the father incubates the growing embryos in his own body   &mdash;   That&rsquo;s not the same as pregnancy.</p>

		<p>To answer Question Diversity #7: </p>
<p>There is no more stigma to teenage pregnancy. When I was in high school (one that was 75% black), there were a couple of pregnant white girls (usually seniors), but scads of pregnant black girls (even among freshmen). This was in the 1980&rsquo;s and the schools were probably under some court order to &#8220;not discriminate against pregnant students&#8221;. Who knows how much money the district had to shell out to give each of these girls private tutors when they were about to go into labor and for a few weeks after the child was born?</p>
<p>When my oldest sister attended this high school, it was virtually all white and once or twice a year, some poor girl &#8220;Went to go live with Aunt Mildred&#8221; (and never to be seen again). It may have been patently unfair, but the thought of teenage pregnancy at that time (late 60&rsquo;s/early 70&rsquo;s) probably did wonders in keeping people off the dole. </p>
<p>&#8220;According to the school&rsquo;s prospectus, its teachers will aim to develop &ldquo;self-confidence and worth&rdquo; in young parents, while promoting &ldquo;critical thinking skills that will open the door for positive life choices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An all-inclusive high school for pregnant and parenting teens will eliminate barriers to completing high school education,&rdquo; said the school&rsquo;s founders, who are led by Jacquelyn Wideman, a charity consultant.</p>
<p>The school will also &ldquo;eliminate stigma and judgmental attitudes associated with those that are pregnant and in school,&rdquo; they said.&#8221; </p>
<p>Are there classes on how to obtain multiple welfare and food stamp entitlements? Or those on how to game to system and move ahead on section-8 housing? Even better, getting junior on SSI when he/she is 2. (SSI=Crazy Checks)</p>
<p>I really wouldn&rsquo;t be upset if there were a way to stigmatize the daylights out of this. However, this will not occur until the money runs out and whitey (along with the talented 10th blacks) refuse to pony up any more. </p>

		<p>&#8220;its teachers will aim to develop &ldquo;self-confidence and worth&rdquo; in young parents&#8221;</p>
<p>- Self esteem is not the problem.  Studies have shown that blacks have higher self esteem and self worth than anybody else.</p>
<p>- Pastors in the black community is code word for big men with a penchant for adoring female acolytes.  I don&rsquo;t think this is a good combination.  What are these &#8216;pastors&rsquo; going to tell these pregnant girls?  &#8220;Okay Shaquandinita, you got to believe in yoself!&#8221;  There won&rsquo;t be any jobs for any of those young mothers.  Just welfare and public assistance for life.  That and a string of substance abuse, casual lovers, more babies and a lot of turmoil.</p>
<p>- Putting the boys with all those mommies!  What are they thinking!  This is what caused the whole problem to begin with.  I work with students, latinos and blacks, and every year we have a whole crop of preggers.  These boys are like predators, especially the &#8216;over age&rsquo; (18 year old ninth graders) who look at the young girls like they were in a variety store.  It won&rsquo;t get better.  Middle class values are built up over generations.  Most of these minorities never had them.</p>

		<p>Another thing.  Run by &#8220;pastors?&#8221;  Public money funds charter schools.  I&rsquo;m sure the ACLU is going to want to hear about this.  And in this case, I would agree with them.  Unless they poultry out because the intended beneficiaries are black and Hispanic, and far being from a good progressive to be racist in any way.</p>

		<p>For a short time, I taught at a Denver public high school for pregnant girls. All were Hispanic, many illegal aliens. Once, a public health nurse came to check if each girl had prenatal care. I was the only one in the room with no free healthcare, but I paid for theirs.</p>

They&rsquo;re going to carry the scarlet letter all their lives. This won&rsquo;t decrease stigma, it will reinforce it.</p>
<p>As they go through life and tell people where they graduated from, everyone will know their history. If they stayed in regular schools, when they graduated, no one outside the school would know.</p>
<p>In a few years, we&rsquo;re going to be reading about how they address the stigma of having gone to this school. Maybe they&rsquo;ll give them fake diplomas and fake year books from other schools. </p>

<p>Stigma?  What Stigma?</p>
<p>If the student is black, unwed teen pregnancy is a cultural norm.</p>
<p>If the student is hispanic, unwed teen pregnancy is not only a cultural norm but encouraged within the hispanic community because it offers not only a plethora of monetary rewards, but a huge bonus if the teen and her family are illegal aliens, i.e., the future ability of the anchor baby to sponsor all of its relatives, including entire villages in Mexico and Central America. </p>
<p>Teen pregnancy, rather than being a stigma, is akin to hitting the jack pot.  Jack pot = your hard earned money.</p>
<p>As a side note, we whites aren&rsquo;t doing much better, we are closing the &#8220;Teen Birth Rate Achievement Gap.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We are truly living in end times when amoral and warped ideals become the new norm. The much maligned Moynihan was correct about defining deviancy down; our society has developed a tolerance for once-intolerable behavior.</p>
<p>As for opening schools strictly for parenting and pregnant teens including teen fathers:</p>
<p>School districts want pregnant girls off their campuses for several reasons.  </p>
<p>1.  Threat of liability if a pregnant girl is attacked, falls or is thrown down stairs or slammed into a locker   &mdash;   common occurrences at middle and high schools these days.</p>
<p>2.  The very real issue of glamorizing teen pregnancy around the high school a la MTV.  Teen pregnancy is highly contagious in the teen community.</p>
<p>3.  The very high absentee and drop out rates of pregnant or teen moms meaning less ADA money, lower test scores and a higher drop-out rate.</p>
<p>Jay writes:</p>
<p><i>Putting the boys with all those mommies! What are they thinking! This is what caused the whole problem to begin with.</i></p>
<p>Let me tell you the thinking behind what seems to be on the surface an insane idea:</p>
<p>The state believes in &#8220;family reunification&#8221; under the dismal hope that these young, immature dads will somehow show some interest in and perhaps even support the children they created. </p>
<p>Males, especially young immature males with underdeveloped frontal lobes and poor impulse control, cause the most child abuse and child deaths.  The idea behind  having teen fathers in these schools is to (hopefully) have them bond with the baby and mother (and thus be more likely to support the baby) and to teach basic child care skills such as ways to deal with a colicky baby instead of hitting or shaking it or throwing it across the room.</p>
<p>The desperately broke state where I live and work, California, is actively persuing child support orders, threatening the mother with cessation of services if she doesn&rsquo;t name the father (I&rsquo;ve had students receive child support payments of $17/month sent directly from prisons, extracted from a rinky-dink prison job the father had, I&rsquo;ve also had students with court orders mandating that they take the baby inside jails and prisons for paternal visitation, all under &#8220;Family Unification&#8221;, of course).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more, lots more, but I feel as if I&rsquo;m rambling so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #16 above   &mdash;   A diploma from &#8220;New Directions Charter High School&#8221; is an absolute career killer.  It sounds like a diploma from a drug rehab facility or one of those juvenile offender &#8220;honor ranches.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;New Directions&#8221; is right up there with &#8220;Martin Luther King, Jr., Learning Centre&#8221; as an identifying name for a ghetto school.  Any American school with the word &#8220;Centre&#8221; [British spelling] is a ghetto pool, just like &#8220;Malcolm X Academy for Excellence and Achievement.&#8221;  Ghetto dwellers LOVE to have school names that go on and on.  They will change a school from &#8220;Calvin Coolidge High School&#8221; to &#8220;Urban Charter School of Excellence for the Performing Arts, Fine Arts, Business, Science and Mathematics.&#8221;  The only subjects left out of the name are History and P.E.  Ridiculous, and it HAS to jump out at people who are thumbing through a sheaf of applications for admission or employment.  </p>
<p>Laughable, but sad.  These kids are marked for life. </p>
