<h1>Blacks More Likely to Be Imprisoned for Drug Crimes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ryan Haggerty, Chicago Tribune, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Blacks in Illinois were nearly five times more likely to be sentenced to prison for low-level drug crimes than whites, according to a state study released Monday.</p>
<p>The disparity is even bigger in Cook County, where blacks charged with low-level drug possession were eight times more likely than whites to be sentenced to prison, according to the report from the Disproportionate Justice Impact Study Commission.</p>
<p>The findings, which are based on 2005 data, are in line with the results of similar local and national studies conducted in the last few years that revealed wide disparities between whites and minorities in drug-related arrests, convictions and sentences.</p>
<p>The divide stems in part from intense police activity in high-crime urban areas, where sales take place in open-air drug markets, making it easier to arrest dealers and buyers, said David Olson, chairman of Loyola University Chicago&rsquo;s criminal justice department.</p>
<p>Police are less likely to take notice of drug activity in suburbs, where crime rates are lower and drugs usually aren&rsquo;t sold on the streets, Olson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minorities aren&rsquo;t necessarily more likely to use drugs than whites, but from the data that&rsquo;s available and from the study, it&rsquo;s evident that they&rsquo;re much more likely to be apprehended,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily a policy of the police department to do that. I think it&rsquo;s just an outcome of where they put their resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The difference in police deployments means minorities involved in the urban drug trade are more likely to have more extensive arrest records than suburban dealers and users, which can lead to longer sentences, Olson said.</p>
<p>A Tribune investigation in 2007 also detailed how some drug laws  &mdash;  such as those targeting dealers arrested near churches, schools, parks and public housing  &mdash;  disproportionately affect predominantly black neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>Several problems with this analysis, especially its loaded conclusion:</p>
<p>1.  They don&rsquo;t define &#8220;low level&#8221; drug crime.  In fact, they don&rsquo;t define &#8220;drug crime&#8221; at all.  Dealing and distributing is always treated much more harshly than possessing.</p>
<p>2.  They don&rsquo;t take into account guilty verdicts as a result of plea deals and guilty verdicts as a result of trials.</p>
<p>3.  They don&rsquo;t take into account how many more, if there were more, crimes that the defendant was initially charged with at any given time.  For instance, a black defendant convicted of a &#8220;low level drug possession&#8221; might have been arrested and charged with a lot more than that, but his lawyers struck a plea deal to agree to the single &#8220;LLDP&#8221; crime in exchange for dropping everything else in exchange for a sentence at or near the maximum for that single &#8220;LLDP.&#8221;  Meanwhile, white defendants for &#8220;LLDP&#8221; tend to have fewer if any other charges at the point of arrest.</p>
<p>4.  They do imply that previous criminal history is taken into account at the point of sentencing, to their credit.  Obviously, the defendant&rsquo;s previous rap sheet cannot be mentioned during the trial phase.</p>
<p>5.  And this article does bring up an angle that I didn&rsquo;t even think of   &mdash;   That black dealers tend to deal more around certain &#8220;prohibited bubble&#8221; so-called &#8220;drug free zones&#8221; (insert laugh tracks here).  See the last sentence.</p>

		<p>I cannot say how, but I work directly with the system of courts in this county. </p>
<p>What the article misses, is how blacks, over and over, repeat the same crimes, rather than quit and go on to do something else. They are arrested repeatedly for low level possession or distribution cases and given ANYTHING but a conviction. 5-8 arrests later, the judge finally gives the suspect some form of probation/boot camp. When they fail that, THEN they get some time in jail at long last. The system does all it can to NOT take responsibility for these people. The county does not want to pay for, feed or house them, and avoids doing so until the arrest/crime cant be ignored. </p>
<p>While there are whites who repeat the same process, most do not immerse themselves in the drug culture so deeply without changing their habits. I have seen many blacks come through the system over and over, but not nearly as many whites. </p>

		<p>It might also have something to do with black being more likely to kill rival white drug dealers but apparently no one is concerned about white criminals.</p>

		<p>Blacks are also far more likely to be co-charged with crimes such as: Resisting arrest, assaulting an officer, giving a false name for purposes of criminal evasion, fleeing &amp; eluding, carrying a concealed weapon, and to have outstanding warrants for other offenses at the time of their arrests. </p>
<p>As with anything else, blacks may or may not use something more frequently, but their use is always more problematic, and in more problematic ways. Whether its beer, the gun, illegal drugs, or the automobile   &mdash;   blacks tend to be less safe (bordering on carelessness), make poorer decisions, and use things in highly problematic ways.  </p>
<p>Examples abound: Hi-fi (Hy-fee) culture where they &#8220;ghost ride&#8221; on the tops of automobiles, make big donut circles in supped up cars, more frequent DUI, more frequent careless &amp; imprudent, more frequent &amp; more severe speeding. </p>
<p>Alcohol: Blacks have higher rates of alcoholism, and binge drinking. They are more prone to drink &amp; drive. They have preferences for beer &amp; wine that are fortified, and for combination of alcohol with other drugs that allow them to party longer. They are more likely to be admitted to the hospital for alcohol use alone, and in combination with other drugs. </p>
<p>Harder drugs: With the exception of methamphetamine abuse Blacks tend to have preferences for different, more potent, and (often) less safe versions of drugs. Crack versus powder cocaine. Heroin vs prescription pills. They tend to use the drugs they do get in a less safe manner, and in less safe combination. A particular part of black culture that I am privy to is the phenomena of hearing someone has fallen out from their choice of drug, and blacks making a run on the dealer who sold the drug that killed someone because if it caused them to die, it must be good. Similar things encouraged the trend of PCP, and WAC abuse. &#8220;The person was so f&rsquo;ked up it took 10 cops to bring them down&#8221; &#8220;I got to get me some of that!&#8221; </p>
<p>Something the media often fails to mention is that it is the black community that is clamoring for something to be done about drugs in their neighborhoods. They know their own people can&rsquo;t use this stuff without being problems, and making problems for others. There isn&rsquo;t a mandate from the white community for cops to go into black neighborhoods to stop people from getting high. The mandate comes from the black community itself.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, while they want someone else to come in to fix it, they also don&rsquo;t want to cooperate with anyone to get it fixed. Its a bit like dealing with a 4 year old throwing a constant temper tantrum; they want to be the center of the universe, until its them in trouble, and then the world is unfair to them, and out to get them. </p>

		<p>The police are either being racist and specifically going after blacks(by targeting drug dealers in aforementioned social areas) or being racist by not caring about the black community.</p>
<p>I have a novel solution to this problem - blacks stop dealing drugs next to churches and what not, and stop committing an insanely disproportionate amount of crime in general, and then everybody will win!</p>

		<p>Whenever the topic of black crime comes up liberals try to change the subject to &#8220;non violent drug offenses.&#8221; This should not distract us from realizing that blacks have a much higher rate of violent crime than whites. </p>

<p>The larger issue here, not the moot point as to whether black or White drug users are locked up more frequently, is the efficacy of continuing the USG &#8216;s insane War on Drugs.  </p>
<p>Because drugs are illegal, profits are astronomical, attracting people who are willing to risk going to prison and use violence to keep their competitors out of the black market.  </p>
<p>The government has never been able to stamp out alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes. No matter how aggressively the Drug Warriors fight their war, the drug trade continues unabated.  The USG spends ~ $41.3 billion <i>each year</i> on enforcement of prohibition. The Cato Institute estimates that drug legalization would yield tax revenue of $46.7 billion annually.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/37qryzf" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/37qryzf</a></p>
<p>And, due to the attendant violence of the illegal drug trade, law-enforcement and prison resources are tied up chasing drug offenders instead of violent criminals.</p>
<p>The Justice Policy Institute reports in 2008:</p>
<p><i>Approximately one-quarter of those people held in U.S. prisons or jails have been convicted of a drug offense. The United States incarcerates more people for drug offenses than any other country. With an estimated 6.8 million Americans struggling with drug abuse or dependence, the growth of the prison population continues to be driven largely by incarceration for drug offenses.</i></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><i>Increases in admissions to substance abuse treatment are associated with<br>
reductions in crime rates&hellip; During the same period, violent crime fell 31.5 percent. And addiction, more than being a criminal offense, is something that can be treated.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4jqnwu2" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/4jqnwu2</a></p>
<p>It is long past time to end the insane War on Drugs and the crime wave sponsored by Drug Prohibition.</p>

		<p>You cant really begin to fathom the real impact of blacks and drugs on Chicago unless you know the history of Cabrini-Green housing project. The buildings are all torn down now, but is a testament to what blacks/drugs are capable of doing to a city. I researched on the internet all of it from beginning to end  and is a real interesting and sad study.  Now Chicago has adopted what they call &ldquo;gentrification&rdquo;  where they try to lure wealthier people to live in these areas. The below YT link is of a 60mins Documentary and shows a naive young white couple that is falling for the &ldquo;gentrification&rdquo; and cant get their checkbook out fast enough to live next to these ex Cabrini-Green residents. You cant make this stuff up.<br>

		<p>8:  I bet the Cabrini-Green projects started the same way its replacement did   &mdash;   Trying to mix market rate renters with welfare clients.  The St. Louis equivalent, the Pruitt-Igoe projects, started the same way.  P-I met its maker in 1976, and most of the space is empty to this day.</p>
<p>If these &#8220;townhouses&#8221; seem to succeed, it will be because the media are covering up crime big time, and/or they are very carefully selecting which (mostly black) welfare tenants from the old high rise C-Gs get to stay.  The 60 Min documentary you linked to did admit there was a screening and background check for C-Gers who wanted to stay in the new complex, but I bet it was even more stringent than they were putting on.</p>

		<p>That townhouse project in Chicago is something else. 70 million dollars for 79 families. They sure suckered a lot of people on that to have the tax payer kick out 886,000, and change, not including building maintenance per welfare family on what will soon become a run down shack like every other bit of public housing. </p>
<p>I feel for the poor suckers moving in. They might be fine with it when they are still childless, but as soon as they have children that are old enough to venture out the front door they will regret those purchases. </p>
<p>I thought our own HUD project madness was bad enough where they pay up to $1500 per month to move ghetto dwellers into homes in good neighborhoods, but even that madness only works out to $540,000 per welfare family over 30 years. Leave it to Chicago to show how to lead the way in throwing good money after bad.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say my own Midwestern community isn&rsquo;t catching up with the stupidity. There is proposal for them to include subsidized cars with that housing as well since the communities that were sick of dealing with criminal blacks got rid of bus services, and voted against billion dollar tax sink holes like metro link rail service being extended.  </p>
<p>The whole thing makes me feel like its HUD&rsquo;s personal mission to screw up every single white neighborhood in America.   </p>

		<p>Drug use is often used as an excuse for black behavior. The truth is that blacks will misbehave even if they are sober. I had a friend who lived next to a black &#8220;church&#8221;. The church blacks were worse than the crack fiend blacks. They were loud and hostile. </p>
