<h1>More Arrests Made in Alleged Gang Rape of 11-Year-Old Cleveland Girl</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Sanz and Courtney Zubowski, KHOU-TV (Houston), February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More arrests have been made in connection with the alleged gang rape of an 11-year-old Cleveland Middle School student, according to the Cleveland Police Department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The suspects named Wednesday are: Jared Glenn McPherson, 18, of Cleveland; Kelvin Rashad King, 21, of Cleveland; Marcus Anthony Porchia, 26, of Cleveland; Devo Shaun Green, 20, of Cleveland; Xavier King, 17, of Cleveland, and Eric Bernard McGowan, 19 of Cleveland.</p>
<p>McPherson and Xavier King were arrested at Cleveland High School where both are students. </p>
<p>McPherson is a starter on the basketball team.</p>
<p>McGowan was already in the Liberty County Jail, for an unrelated case, when he was charged with sexual assault.</p>
<p>Cleveland police are searching for two other suspects in the case, 22-year-old Carlos Bernard Ligons and 27-year-old Cedric De Ray Scott. </p>
<p>They expect to add more names to the list of suspects charged and some of them will likely be Cleveland High School students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Late Wednesday evening one suspect&rsquo;s mother sat down with 11 News to discuss her outrage with the police department&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My son said he never touched the girl. He had never been around the girl,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When it first came out I asked him and he said, &#8216;No mama, I wouldn&rsquo;t do something like that.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>

		<p>Such fine upstanding men. Perfect examples of what it means to be a MAN! If only we all brought up our children to be like these men, if only. The world would be a better place. If you would not allow one of these great future leaders to marry and have intercourse with your daughter, you are nothing but a RACIST! </p>

		<p>They look like some of my students.  I am not making up the following story.  After school one day when the &#8216;students&rsquo; were leaving the school, a crowd of about 15 young black males started chanting loudly as they headed for the exits (and pumping their fists), saying: &#8220;Let&rsquo;s get those b****s pregnant!&#8221;  Over and over.</p>

<p>Good enough for me.  Case closed.  Why is this civilization destroyer&rsquo;s mother complaining?  Oh yeah, he&rsquo;s black.  How is it that black people can STILL honestly believe that the police go around trying to steal black men&rsquo;s semen and placing at crimes?  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think I read that over 28% of all Detroit citizens think the government created AIDS, released it into the ghettos, and have a cure for it but won&rsquo;t release it.</p>
<p>I have a friend that was accused of rape.  The DNA never matched up and he was free (plus he wasn&rsquo;t in the same city as the victim at the time, it was a case of mistaken identity).  The truth will come out, it is not a conspiracy.  </p>
<p>Lastly, anyone know the race of the victim?  I am assuming she is black since the story made the papers.</p>

<p>I once saw an episode of &#8220;COPS&#8221; where the cameras actually caught a crime in progress. A black teen-aged boy stole a scooter outside a convenience store. The scooter wasn&rsquo;t very fast so the police officer gave a slow-speed chase with his cruiser&rsquo;s dash cam catching the whole thing. After a couple of minutes the scooter pulled into an apartment complex, the boy jumped off and ran into one of the apartments. </p>
<p>The officer hadn&rsquo;t even gotten out of his car before several women and a ton of kids came running out. And the mother was screaming, &#8220;It wasn&rsquo;t my son! He didn&rsquo;t steal it! He&rsquo;s been here the whole time!&#8221; Now, whenever I see &#8220;outraged&#8221; blacks passionately claiming innocence I remember that episode of &#8220;COPS&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Xavier King, at age 17, should be tried as an adult, along with the rest of these rapists.</p>
<p>Upon being found guilty, when they are sent to prison, it should be with a court order to prohibit them from having any kind of protective custody.</p>
<p>Then they will face the justice they truly deserve, because of an &#8220;honor among thieves&#8221; violation of the code of honor that prison inmates have!</p>
<p>If you go to prison for robbing a bank, you earn hero status.  </p>
<p>But if you go to prison for sexual molestation, murder, violent brutality, or any other kind of a crime against children, you are in for a fate worse than the death penalty!</p>
<p>This is because a large number of prison inmates, were themselves, abused as children.</p>

		<p>Black gang rape on blacks is, of course, as common a story as dog bites man (assuming the Cleveland public schoolgirl is most likely black also).  And, of course, black rape on whites is not unusual either.  It would sure be a hoot to hear an MSM &#8220;journalist&#8221; give this as the reason such stories are ignored!</p>

		<p>When I was about 10-11 years old I was shown a tree where justice was done back in the 1920s for some guys that raped a child. In modern times they would call it a lynching but these are the types of crimes that get people&rsquo;s blood up. </p>

<p>Why does the media always insist on speaking to the mothers of the accused? It is always the same: my little angel may have been in trouble before but that&rsquo;s only because his friends are bad. But he was just a misunderstood sweetie. </p>
<p>It is sad that at most one or two will be convicted and even then it will be lesser charges. In gang rape cases, even with DNA evidence, it is just too hard to prove who did what and whether or not some of the participants were themselves being held prisoner and were forced by their mean friends to do things to the little girl that they don&rsquo;t want to do. At least that&rsquo;s what the lawyers always say. Which is why we need a federal gang-rape law that holds all present responsible for all crimes committed. I can think of no crime worse than gang rape and we need to be able to convict these torturers. </p>

		<p>As I gaze at the faces of these fine young black males and look deeply into their eyes all I can see is lost potential for Americans. I see future doctors, teachers and community leaders holding up numbers as they are photographed.<br>
These males are the future of black America, why are they being flasely accused when this 11 year old child probably forced herself on these men? What mental defense does a 24 year old black male have when dealing with a 11 year old girls mind?<br>
No what I see here is RACISM not allowing blacks to do what blacks do. I am sorry but that is how I see it.</p>

		<p>If you read the comment section in the original article (which is ALWAYS encouraging to a loyal amren reader) they say that the idiots actually took cell phone pictures and video of the gang rape. Astounding stupidity saying so much not just about the morality level of the participants but also to the intended audience of these images. They clearly had the intention of sharing the magical moments with all of their friends who they believed would be just as impressed at the gang rape of an 11 yr-old as they were.<br>
  I sometimes wonder what planet I now reside on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the way of the media. They did it big-time when Omar Thornton killed all those white guys at the Budweiser plant in Connecticut. After reporting that nine were killed instead of eight (because he killed himself, so he&rsquo;s a victim, too. In fact the only victim for the MSM), the first thing CNN did was interview his aunt and another relative and his white girlfriend, with an emphasis on how painful it was for them. Then there was a panel discussion on the racist environment at Budweiser. Not until much later did they fleetingly report that he had been taped stealing beer and fired for it.</p>
<p>Nobody bought it. Later on I overheard a conversation among two women who looked like typical soft liberals (just a guess) talking about the case and one said &#8220;They&rsquo;re trying to make it out like it was racism&hellip;&#8221; and the other agreeing. Yet another OJ moment and a further crack in the racial grievance propaganda machine. I think that so many of us have been constantly &#8216;on message&rsquo; as they say and repeating our points so often that we are finally breaking through, with help from the internet and of course, the minorities themselves. All to the good.</p>

		<p>To olewhitelady,</p>
<p>The reason such stories are usually ignored is because the police don&rsquo;t care.  In some cases the police officers witness a rape of a child in progress and do nothing, and may even refuse to take a report.  In most of these cases it doesn&rsquo;t matter what color the police, suspects and victims are.  My beliefs about law enforement and human nature and union labor were changed forever.</p>

		<p>Blacks seem to think that whites commit gang rape at around the same rate that they do.  But when was the last time you read about that happening?  The only time I&rsquo;ve read about whites assaulting women as a group were historical accounts of various wars. Apparently, in peace time, white guys just don&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>This story supports my hypothesis that the trillion dollar programs through which the US has attempted to improve blacks over the past half century so has only succeeded in peeling away the small number of capable of functioning in a modern society, leaving behind the kind of people in the photographs above.</p>
<p>Those left behind - the black underclass - are probably in decline due to dysgenic trends, i.e. the less intelligent having more children than the more intelligent.</p>
<p>If my hypothesis is correct, then the average IQ of the crowd of goons above is probably around 75 or so.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p>The great society programs helped a few blacks while at the same time breeding the majority into a new race of morons.</p>

		<p>Update on the story:  I was not sure about a few things on this case, but will clarify what I just read.  This is NOT Cleveland, OH.  This is Cleveland, TX.  Cleveland, Texas is about 40 miles north from Houston and is 60% white.  Two more suspects were named on top of the original 11 and it is estimated that there were between 17-27 perps.  </p>
<p>Due to the racial divide between the citizens from this town I cannot say that I am positive, but it seems that the victim is white.  Blacks have been throttling the courts in protest and are on the verge of riots.  They would not be like this if the victim was black, as history shows.</p>
<p>Also, I just read an article that this just happened to an 11 year old Swedish girl in Stockholm by 20+ African refugees.  Coincidence?  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear that black people have a horrific problem with violent crime, and they&rsquo;re the ones who suffer most from it. However, rationally, this empirical fact really does not mesh with an authoritarian conservative approach to crime. Most black criminals are basically mental children or young teens in the bodies (brains aside) of high-testosterone grown-ups. So it does not make sense to hold them as responsible as more evolved people with IQs of at least around 100. The humane and effective solutions are all psychometric, medical and eugenic (all voluntary this time around), not police statist and punitive. You can&rsquo;t take a night stick and beat some sense into an IQ 70 ghetto boy. All that really gives you is an IQ 70 ghetto boy with bruises that we might not be able to see, plus even more hatred for the &#8216;white devil&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>I would not be surprised at all if the girl was white, since black males think they have a right to have sex with white females at will. The fact the accused rapists&rsquo; families are reacting this way along with blacks in general almost certainly ensures the victim was white, and their impeding the police and courts efforts to punish these monsters. The only thing that should be done with all of them is to take them out to an oak tree and hang all of them there. Even if the girl was black, they all deserve to hang from nooses without a black bag over their head. This is a monstrous crime that merits not only death, but a horrible degrading death for those who dare do something like this to a child, who probably will be mentally and spiritually destroyed for the rest of her life. Every crime like this these stupid blacks commit only creates justifiable hatred towards them from whites, and sooner or later whites are going to start killing these rapists before the police can arrest them our of sheer revenge. Had the girl been my child, I would have killed all or at least as many of them out of revenge, law be damned. Crimes like this are eroding faith in the legal system, and blacks who rape children are going to be lynched by vengeful whites as they should be.</p>

They are very different than we are, and do not seem to melt into the proverbial Melting Pot theory. With blacks it is always how the white man has held them back and how the white man is a racist. It is never about their 65 to 85 IQ. Or their never ending expectation that whites owe them something.</p>

		<p>Sophia..I agree black IQ plus testostrone plus modern <br>
temptations produce endless crime. Physical punishment<br>
after the fact doesnt make things better. So we need<br>
to control what we can control, and remove blacks from high opportunity environments.<br>
A simpler society that doesnt demand high IQ performance<br>
and will allow a free outlet for their excess testostrone<br>
I was thinkinging of farm labor, in a warm sunny clime<br>
say the deep South..say picking cotton..</p>

		<p>Cleveland Middle School is a &#8220;diverse&#8221; school, a lot of white kids go there, the victim could be white.  It is amazing how after all these years nothing has changed with these people, still raping and maurading, just like when I was growing up in the 1970&rsquo;s.  I guess all the anti-racism laws, all the affirmative action, all the school funding, all the targeted black scholarships, all the mentors and self-esteem lessons, all the fast-track post-office jobs, and all the black middle-class success stories, and now a black president still hasn&rsquo;t tamed the black rage.   Well, how long can White/Asians be played for chumps?   The fourth turning is upon us.  </p>

		<p>As the  mother of a very new 12 year old my only comment is &#8220;the truth will tell&#8221;.  I cant help but weep for both that little girl and her family. I dont care what color the person&rsquo;s are that raped a child, I STILL agree in hanging. We waste enough money on keeping them in prison only to get out and strike again so lets reserve our state money, pay for childrens EDUCATION and correct this problem. What mine STAY&rsquo;S MINE and what ever violence is never an excuse, I have NO TOLERENCE for RAPIST. What I want to know is why COLOR has so much to do with this blog?</p>
