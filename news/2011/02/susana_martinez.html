<h1>Susana Martínez Tells Police to Check Immigration Status in New Mexico</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, February 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Mexico Gov. Susana Martínez is directing police to check the immigration status of people arrested for crimes.</p>
<p>The Republican, who made headlines after the November elections when she became the nation&rsquo;s first Latina governor, said she was eliminating an executive order by former Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, that prohibited law enforcement officials from asking people about immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, Martínez said law enforcement working for state agencies will continue to be barred from asking about the immigration status of someone who is a crime victim, a witness to a crime or seeking police assistance. Richardson had ordered that in 2005.</p>
<p>Martínez&rsquo;s order coincided with a bill introduced Monday that says that undocumented immigrants no longer could obtain New Mexico driver&rsquo;s licenses that serve as government identification, but they could still drive legally under a compromise bill introduced today.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Martinez, a career prosecutor before being elected in November, has called on the Legislature to repeal the 2003 law in which people can obtain New Mexico licenses without providing proof of immigration status. {snip}</p>
<p>As for the governor&rsquo;s executive order regarding police checking immigration documents, Scott Darnell, a spokesman for Martínez, said state police will not ask about immigration status of motorists stopped for traffic violations such as speeding. The administration&rsquo;s policy applies only when someone is arrested for a crime, he said.</p>
<p>Martínez&rsquo;s policy drew criticism from a civil rights group.</p>
<p>&#8220;This executive order invites racial profiling by giving an incentive to police to arrest people who look and sound &#8216;foreign.&rsquo; New Mexicans should not have to fear that a broken taillight or other pretextual stop will lead to their arrest because of the color of their skin,&#8221; said Peter Simonson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Mexico.</p>

		<p>Funny thing is, Martinez came out against SB 1070 in Arizona during her campaign for New Mexico Governor.  But with the stroke of an ink pen, she just implemented one of SB 1070&rsquo;s crucial provisions.  And her doing that illicited the same kind of criticism from the Raza/ACLU types that SB 1070 got.</p>

		<p>I love how the media tries to call white people hispanic if they came from a white ruling class from some other nation. It allows them to show how well hispanics can integrate into our society. I saw a magazine article about influential hispanics. They practically all had blue eyes. It was hilarious. The only difference between them and regular whites was the last name. This governor was on the list and she looked white to me. If her skin color truly depicted the average hispanic, I wonder if she would of made that order. I doubt it. </p>

		<p>The illegals fled Arizona to neighboring states before SB 1070 was even signed. I hope Colorado is paying attention, because I&rsquo;d bet an illegal would pick liberal Colorado over Texas. Texas is too much like Mexico now, and Oklahoma is on the &#8220;enforcement bandwagon&#8221; for the moment.</p>

		<p><i>New Mexicans should not have to fear that a broken taillight or other pretextual stop will lead to their arrest because of the color of their skin,&rdquo; said Peter Simonson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Mexico.</i></p>
<p>New Mexicans <i>do not</i> have to fear a pretextual stop leading to their arrest due to immigration status.</p>
<p>Because they are already citizens of the United States and of New Mexico. That&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>New Mexicans who <i>already have outstanding warrants for their arrest</i> have to fear being pulled over for the proverbial broken tail light. But that same condition-outstanding warrants for arrest-also applies to a vast number of other people in this  country who routinely drive around when the cops would love to talk to them for any number of reasons.</p>
<p>So I fail to see any sort of problem.</p>

		<p>The bill that prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining New Mexico drivers licenses is a meaningless piece of window dressing. If illegals can still legally drive due to the provisions in the compromise bill, then why to hell do they need a drivers license.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like cancelling their birthday, then sending them a birthday card.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m disturbed by this:</p>
<p><i>Martínez&rsquo;s order coincided with a bill introduced Monday that says that undocumented immigrants no longer&hellip;. could still drive legally under a compromise bill introduced today.</i></p>
<p>What on earth does that mean?  What kind of &#8220;compromise bill?&#8221;  </p>
<p>What kind of stupid &#8220;bill&#8221; allows <b>illegal colonists to drive on US roads?</b></p>
<p>No one who broke into this country <b>illegally</b> should be allowed to drive.</p>
<p>Period.  </p>
<p>Unlicensed, drunken illegal colonists have turned California&rsquo;s roads into a Mad Max-style free for all resulting in rivers of blood.  I see this on my commute to work every morning on California&rsquo;s freeways, barely road-worthy cars driven by mexicans who have no sense or regard for traffic laws.</p>
<p><i>Latinos surpassed whites in the number of DUI arrests in 1992 and have been at the top of the list each year thereafter. No other ethnic or racial group has such a high level of DUI arrests statewide, according to the California Department of Justice.  The problem is not specific to  California.</i></p>
<p><i>The DUI arrest rate for Latinos in Raleigh, N.C., is 45 percent, while they account for only 8 percent of the population</i></p>
<p><i>Latinos account for 43 percent of DUI arrests in Texas but only 32 percent of the population</i></p>
<p><i>The Spanish-speaking population makes up 41 percent of Miami&rsquo;s citizenship and is overrepresented in death and injury caused by impaired-driving crashes.</i></p>

<p><i>For years, the government has treated drunk driving by foreigners as no big deal, despite the fact that drinking and driving is a culturally positive value in hispanic societies indicating masculinity&hellip;Even dangerous serial drunk drivers have been repeatedly been turned loose on American streets instead of being deported. In one shocking case, the deaths of Sean and Donna Wilson, the killer had not been deported even after 14 arrests.</i></p>
<p>Why are foreign nationals with a penchant for drinking and driving allowed to drive freely  on US roads, making them treacherous for innocent victims   &mdash;    while the US government looks the other way?</p>
<p><i>Three-year-old Marten Kudlis was killed as he sat in an ice cream shop by a crash caused by a vehicle driven at 80 mph by Francis Hernandez, a drunk illegal alien from Guatemala who had been arrested 16 times but never deported.</i></p>

		<p>Measures against illegals seem to be increasing lately. Pardon what must be a dumb question, but why is this? Is it just because more Republicans are now in office? Did those Republicans run on anti-illegal platforms? Apparently not this governor, judging from an earlier post.</p>

		<p>She grew up in El Paso and no doubt saw all the problems caused by illegals.  Her husband is a Sheriff&rsquo;s deputy who has to deal with illegal&rsquo;s and crime.  I think she might be the real deal.  Stay tuned.  </p>

		<p>Time to get SERIOUS about illegal immigration. Starting with the Federal Government. Crack down on employers not using E-VERIFY. On employers turning a blind eye at the probably illegal alien status of the Latinos they hire!</p>
<p>Let the Feds institute a National I.D. card program. Make it optional to get   &mdash;   but without the I.D. card, prohibiting sales of guns, cars, hiring employees who cannot produce one. The ONLY THING stopping us from ridding ourselves of illegal immigration   &mdash;   being the WILL TO DO SO!</p>
