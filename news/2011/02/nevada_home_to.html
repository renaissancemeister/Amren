<h1><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-02/nevada-home-to-largest-share-of-illegal-workers.html">Nevada Home to Largest Share of Illegal Workers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cristina Silva, Bloomberg, February 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nevada has the largest share of illegal workers in the nation, with roughly 10 percent of its work force not authorized by the federal government, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group.</p>
<p>The report published Tuesday shows a slight jump in illegal workers as Nevada&rsquo;s job market has shrunk amid record unemployment. Nevada&rsquo;s population of illegal workers was 9.4 percent in 2009. The Silver State&rsquo;s unemployment rate has since climbed to 14.5 percent, the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>Nevada also has the largest share of illegal immigrants at 7.2 percent. Only 3.7 percent of people in the United States are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nevada&rsquo;s tourism-rich economy lured foreign workers for years with promises of plentiful jobs in its construction and service industries. Immigrants urged friends and relatives to relocate to Nevada with their stories of fair wages. Employers fueled the migration, sometimes sending headhunters to Mexico and other Latin American nations to recruit affordable laborers.<br>

		<p>For the picture nation-wide, Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, in testimony before a House subcommittee on immigration, provides a neat statistical encapsulation of the federal government&rsquo;s success in using immigration, legal and illegal, to drive American citizens out of the workforce and into the unemployment lines:</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past decade, 13.1 million immigrants (legal and illegal) arrived in the United States, but there was a net decline of one million jobs over the same period. The disconnect between immigration and employment was even more stark over the past two years; according to a report last week from Northeastern University&rsquo;s Center for Labor Market Studies, U.S. household employment declined by 6.26 million, but 1.1 million new immigrants nonetheless got jobs.&#8221; (Mark Krikorian, Executive Director, Center for Immigration Studies<br>

January 26, 2011)<br>

		<p>Of course Nevada has the highest share of illegal workers in the nation. That&rsquo;s because they have an ally in Congress, who fights for them on a daily basis; to ensure their efforts to colonize and displace the White man in his very own country are not in vain.</p>
<p> Reid is the best friend any illegal invader could ever hope to have in Congress.<br>

		<p>I live in Las Vegas and this shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, Nevada is next door to a state that cracked down-Arizona-so the illegals have come here. Nevada is also,unfortunately, next door to a failed sanctuary state-California-that has become too expensive for them to live in.<br>

I saw a pro-&#8216;immigrant&rsquo; woman on c-span. She said we needed to keep high levels of &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; so they&rsquo;re here when the economy turns around.</p>
<p>These people can rationalize anything.</p>

The U.S. government owns almost 650 acres of land.<br>
The corporations, as most people know, align with Washington to employ illegals as slave laborers but also work as a force multiplier to put American lives at risk.                    Even as the drug war in Mexico escalates across our southern border.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<p>1. Nevada&hellip;..84.5 %  <br>
2. Alaska&hellip;..69.1%<br>
3. Utah&hellip;&hellip;.57.4%<br>
4. Oregon&hellip;..53.1%<br>

		<p>I lived in Nevada for damned near thirty years, and I can tell you exactly how these illegals came to be in the state.  When I first moved to Nevada, Howard Hughes was still the basic reigning economic force in the state.  The mafia was in its last stages of going legit, realizing that there was more to be made by simply expanding and investing capital than by skimming profits.  Most casino jobs, other than dealing or being a pit boss, were fairly low paying.  Las Vegas was still, for most practical purposes, still segregated, with blacks living in &#8220;northtown&#8221; and working in casinos as janitors and busboys, or other menial jobs.</p>
<p>Then, entrepreneurs like Steve Wynn and others began to transform Vegas into a &#8220;family&#8221; destination, with sprawling, family friendly casinos with entertainment themes.  The streets around the casinos were always safe, and business boomed.  Mormons, many of them left over from the Howard Hughes days, controlled their fair share of management positions and helped in this boom, steering competent mormon workers into mid level wage earning positions.  I knew of quite a few non mormon kids who deliberately &#8220;knocked up&#8221; mormon girls in high school, in order to facilitate a &#8220;shotgun&#8221; wedding and a subsequent entry level casino career type job.  I am not disparaging Mormons  &mdash;  they take care of their own, and I have always known them to be clean, hardworking people who are very tolerant of others and their faiths.</p>
<p>What this did, however, was create a job environment with jobs that  &mdash;  I won&rsquo;t call it jobs that white people wouldn&rsquo;t do, but more like whites could make much more money doing something else.  When I was in high school, minimum wage was $3.35 an hour, and that is what busboys made.  I knew plenty of white kids who bussed tables, and there were no illegals doing this work.  What happened, though, was that the economy simply boomed.  Busboys could make $7 an hour in the late nineties, but dishwashers could make $9.  I knew kids that had dropped out of high school that were making as much as teachers.  I had a friend who barely made it through high school who was making $30 an hour managing one of the &#8220;motion&#8221; rides at one of the casinos.  There was more work to do, literally, than there were workers.  So&hellip;</p>
<p>The illegals started pouring in.  They took over all of the &#8220;low&#8221; paying jobs.  The relatively few blacks in Las Vegas seemed content with welfare.  The white trash who didn&rsquo;t want to work existed on the sidelines selling meth.  Everything was great  &mdash;  everyone who wanted to work had a job, the housing market was booming.</p>
<p>No one seemed to notice, however, that the quality of life was deteriorating rapidly.  I moved from Las Vegas to Reno to go to college in 1984.  I was literally shocked the first time I saw a bum passed out in front of a slot machine.  That would never have happened in the &#8220;old&#8221; Las Vegas of Howard Hughes and the mob.  They would have taken him outside, beat him, and stolen his shoes to teach him a lesson.  While the mob had an extremely negative influence on Las Vegas, they did keep the streets safe for tourists.  Petty robbery and such were bad for business, and practically did not exist.</p>
<p>With the dissolution of mob influence in Las Vegas, however, things went rapidly downhill.  Black gangs from LA began exporting their influence to Las Vegas.  Parts of the city rapidly turned into &#8220;no fly&#8221; zones.  The progeny of the illegals found it more lucrative to turn to gangs and selling drugs than to legitimate work.</p>
<p>Reno, where I lived for a number of years, never quite degenerated to the level of Las Vegas, but it was a microcosm of the effects of illegals as well.  Mexicans like cold weather about as much as blacks do, but they still managed to make it up north in significant numbers.</p>
<p>When the financial meltdown of 2009 hit Nevada, it basically melted down a monstrous ponzi scheme.  Tourists quit coming, and an economy based on tourism collapsed.  Artificially inflated union wages started finally choking the casinos, as they did the auto industry.  I talked to a friend in Reno recently, and he told me that official numbers are too low, that unemployment there is over twenty percent, and it&rsquo;s worse in Las Vegas.  The casinos are tanking.</p>
<p>Trouble is brewing in Nevada.  Unlike other states where the illegals are fleeing for greener pastures, the ones in Nevada seem to be staying put.  That is ominous.</p>

		<p>Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!</p>
<p>Hire an illegal alien and put or keep an American citizen out of work! Maybe citizens need to write to the Nevada C. of C. and tell them we are NOT spending our vacation dollars in Nevada. Until the state rids itself of illegal immigrants and replaces them with American citizens doing those jobs   &mdash;   but at a fair wage!</p>
<p>What with those super expensive hotels and entertainment venues, you can&rsquo;t convince me the owners can&rsquo;t survive if forced to pay Americans a fair wage to do the jobs.</p>
