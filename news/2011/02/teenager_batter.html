			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), February 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A brave teenager has spoken for the first time of the harrowing ordeal of being beaten up in an arranged marriage after her father tried to sell her for £10,000.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old girl was tricked into flying to Pakistan then forced to marry a 31-year-old man so he could get a British passport.</p>
<p>She has described how she feared she would die after being hit, scarred with broken glass and locked up for refusing to get married.</p>
<p>Her harrowing story has been revealed as part of BBC Radio 1&rsquo;s Newsbeat investigation into forced marriages.</p>
<p>The girl, who would not be named, said: &#8216;It was just about the money. He was literally selling me and my nationality so I could bring the person back.</p>
<p>&#8216;In pounds, it would have been about £10,000.</p>
<p>&#8216;He whacked me across the face, then I started rebelling more, saying &#8220;no&#8221;. </p>
<p>Then he got a glass and scarred my arms. He had somebody holding me from behind and he got a glass and was cutting very deep.</p>
<p>&#8216;I thought he might kill me. I thought I was going to die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The beatings started when the young girl refused to get married. She was then locked up without food or water.</p>
<p>Fortunately she summoned her strength and escaped to the British High Commission in Pakistan. She then returned home and was reunited with her worried mother.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by Newsbeat show that her ordeal is one of many suffered by an estimated 1,735 potential forced marriages involving British citizens in 2010.</p>
<p>It is believed that a third of the girls in arranged marriages are under 18. Newsbeat claims that the youngest was just 13.</p>
<p>Campaigners against forced marriages have now called for more awareness of the problem which is largely confined to Asian communities.</p>
<p>Jeremy Browne, the minister in joint charge of the forced marriage unit, said: &#8216;We think it&rsquo;s a genuine priority, we want to help people.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Pakistanis are so bad that the Brits have a special police squad that follows up on leads that teenage Pakistani girls are being spirited back to Pakistan unawares to be forced into marriages.</p>
<p> The squad also checks on Pakistani girls at the airport to make sure they are going willingly and are not drugged or otherwise tricked. The Pakistanis are a real nasty bunch, and God help you if they get settled into your town and start a Pakistani colony. </p>
<p>Bangladeshis are just as nasty.</p>

		<p>In the years prior to my awakening, I was heavily involved in a local music scene. At that time, about 15 years ago, there were two Pakistani sisters that mingled with our extened social circle. Both sisters were Westernized and quite attractive in their exotic way and their father was a prominent local surgeon. The father would probably have been an unhappy camper if he new his daughters were hanging around with a bunch of skateboarders and punks! I even attended secret parties at their very nice house in a very nice neighborhood while the parents and their evil spoiled little brother were visiting Pakistan.</p>
<p>Eventually my views changed and I moved on from that scene, but one day I ran into one of our mutual friends that informed me that the Pakistani sisters&rsquo; dad had died, and the elder sister was in an arranged marriage with a first cousin that she had never met! The younger girl was at that time living in an apartment and avoiding gender slavery though I never found out what happened to her.</p>

We can be saturated with these kinds of tales that let us know how incompatible Islam is with Western society, but, as the quote (mis?)attributed to Churchill goes, &#8220;A liberal is a man who will not take his own side in a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our policy and taste-makers are fairly ethno-masochistic leftists who follow a simple dictum: Anyone to the left of me is my friend, anyone to the right is my enemy. For evidence of this see the brouhaha at Columbia University. The Iranian president (I won&rsquo;t even attempt to butcher his name) was welcomed with open arms to the campus, despite the reality that his stances (hatred of gays, Jews, and a penchant for all things nuclear) would have aroused antipathy in the college faculty and students if his views had been espoused by a white male. Meanwhile, a wounded American veteran was booed from the rafters for saying that perhaps recruiters should be allowed back on campus.</p>
<p>So remember, I&rsquo;m not trying to discourage Amren (or Geert Wilders, or the BNP) from spreading these stories, but common sense cannot pierce cast-iron orthodoxies held by powerful but suicidal whites with a death-wish for their culture and history. </p>

<p>No they don&rsquo;t. If they really wanted to put an end to this they would stop giving out marriage visas. For people who really want to get married it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. As they would gladly emigrate to the other country to be together.</p>

		<p>This is another good argument against birthright citizenship. Not only can the citizen child of immigrants be used as an anchor baby, but the child can also be exploited for citizenship through forced marriage, as was attempted with the girl in this story. The British government should make it impossible to gain a passport or citizenship through an underage bride.  </p>

		<p>The thing is, had she agreed to the scam, as most of them do, we&rsquo;d have heard nothing about this, and everything would have been &#8220;fine&#8221; by the genocidal multiculturalists.</p>

		<p>Muslim family values on display here. Also, keep in mind that in Pakistan 1st and 2nd cousin marriage is extremely common. In Britain a lot of their unwanted, disabled children, due to birth defects, are dumped in institutions in disproportionate numbers, leaving the British public to pick up the tab. </p>

		<p>Nothing will be done, the practice will continue because of the 11th commandment &#8220;Thou shalt not OUTRAGE the muslims or blacks&#8221;</p>

		<p>Agree with 5. The entire immigrant system is filled with many<br>
frauds.. money and citizenship/visas.   Another example of the diversity fraud putupon peoples of Western cultures.  Immigration ties in with diversity.  They are part of the same stew cooking till simmered.  Look at those who legislate and promote diversity and you can find the roots of this problem.</p>

		<p>I had watched a documentary on these marriages. There was a woman who was in love with a man who her parents forbade her to marry. She was forced to marry a first cousin. Ironically, the man she was in love with was also a cousin! Go figure.</p>
