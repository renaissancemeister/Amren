<h1>The Root Interview: Michael Fosberg on Being the Incog-Negro</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Thomas, The Root, February 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michael Fosberg was 30 when he found out that his long-lost biological father was black. His life, he says, is so much richer for that discovery  &mdash;  which is the subject of a one-man play, Incognito, and now a memoir by the same name.</p>
<p>Michael Fosberg is a professional actor who was raised by his biological mother and adoptive father in a working-class white family. At the age of 30, upon hearing the news of his parents&rsquo; divorce, Fosberg began a search for his long-lost biological father.</p>
<p>Two years later, armed with just a name (John Woods) and a city (Detroit), he tracked down his dad and spoke to him, for the very first time, by phone. His father said that there were a few things Fosberg&rsquo;s mother hadn&rsquo;t told him. First, that he&rsquo;s always loved his son and thought about him. And two: &#8220;I&rsquo;m African American.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Fosberg  &mdash;  who, like his father, can pass for white  &mdash;  got over the initial shock, his dad told him about his black side: a grandfather who was chairman of the science-and-engineering department at Norfolk State University; a great-granddad who was an all-star pitcher for the Negro Leagues; a great-great-grandfather who fought in the Civil War as a member of the 54th regiment of the &#8220;colored infantry&#8221;; and the many family members still living, most of whom are thriving despite the obstacles in 21st-century America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>TR: </b>How has your life changed since you discovered that your dad is black?</p>
<p><b>MF: </b>My life is so much fuller than I ever imagined. Having this culturally rich family come into focus for me, and being able to embrace them, and them to embrace me  &mdash;  I can&rsquo;t even tell you the love that we&rsquo;ve shared. But now I also get to share the story, and to affect people in a way that I never dreamed possible.</p>
<p><b>TR: </b>What was it like learning the illustrious history and heritage of the black side of your family?</p>
<p><b>MF: </b>Finding out that what I had sort of felt my whole life  &mdash;  that I was indeed part black but couldn&rsquo;t explain  &mdash;  and then to discover that I have this rich history? Wow. It was amazing, overwhelming.</p>
<p><b>TR: </b>How do you now identify yourself on the census?</p>
<p><b>MF: </b>Well, I&rsquo;m biracial, multiracial. Although I&rsquo;m not that happy about the whole definition there, I&rsquo;m going to check the &#8220;Black, African Am or Negro&#8221; box. The &#8220;White&#8221; box doesn&rsquo;t say anything about my identity on the other side of my family  &mdash;  Armenian  &mdash;  [so] I can&rsquo;t go there. I also check the [&#8220;Some other race&#8221;] box and then write in, &#8220;Armenian.&#8221; That&rsquo;s what I did in the 2010 census.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>TR: </b>What do you think of &#8220;color-blind&#8221; and &#8220;post-racial&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>MF: </b>We don&rsquo;t want to promote color blindness. We want to recognize and understand what&rsquo;s in front of us. The same denial exists when they think we&rsquo;re in some post-racial environment. You remember? Right after we elected Barack, some thought that since we&rsquo;ve elected a black man, everything&rsquo;s OK. As if that would solve all of our problems.</p>

<p>**************</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sentence.  I take it that he means that Blacks should be racially conscious, that they should see color, that they should recognize another Black man even if he can pass for White.  Of course if a White man said exactly the same thing, the hate crime posse&rsquo;s would be out hunting another evil White racist.  It&rsquo;s amazing how these Blacks, - and all other non-White groups - get away with this incredible double standard of talk and behavior, the same double standard that chastises Whites and even, in some cases, destroys their lives.  Behavior and talk that nobody says anything about, unless of course, it&rsquo;s a White man that says it.</p>

		<p>Trying to follow the &#8220;begats&#8221; I conclude that Michael Fosberg is an octoroon.  But he still identifies as black and certainly The Root sees him as such.  Blacks are as eager to apply the &#8220;one drop&#8221; rule as any old fashioned southern segregationist.</p>
<p><i>MF: We don&rsquo;t want to promote color blindness.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised.  After decades of the left never ignoring race, we on the right are forced to do the same.  Of course we are slandered for it.</p>

<p>Right, and who was it that promoted this point of view? It was the lefties, as a pretense to get Obama elected in the first place. Now that he&rsquo;s in office, it&rsquo;s treated as if it was some kind of insult against blacks.</p>
<p>And who was it who predicted that Obama&rsquo;s election would change absolutely nothing? Why it was those awful &#8220;racists,&#8221; of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The truth is, when people of different backgrounds marry and produce offspring, it creates more types that are harder to match,&rsquo;&hellip;..there are so many possible racial and ethnic combinations that finding a match can still be extremely difficult&hellip;Populations in different parts of the world developed certain proteins, or markers, that are part of the body&rsquo;s natural defenses. These markers help the immune system determine which cells are foreign and should be rejected. A match between two people who share many markers will reduce the risk of the donor and recipient cells attacking each other. Because certain markers tend to cluster in particular ethnic groups, matches are most often found among people of shared backgrounds. Multiracial patients often have uncommon profiles and a much harder time finding a donor.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Let us see his photo and we can decide if he can &#8220;pass&#8221; for white.<br>
Most Americans are so racially ignorant that they will accept mixed-race people as white, but if you train your eyes, and if you have spent any time in the Caribbean or New Orleans (same thing, really) you can recognize them fairly quickly.<br>
Notice that the man used the ridiculous term &#8220;African-American,&#8221; which is virtually meaningless.  Why would he not say that he has a tiny amount of black ancestry?  That would be more accurate.</p>

If the guy in this article had no outward physical characteristics that would indicate he carried sub-Saharan African blood then there is a very good chance that his &#8220;Black&#8221; father was probably one-fourth Black or less.</p>
<p>During the slavery days in Louisiana there were slave breeders who specialized in one-eighth Black female slaves who were a favorite of the gentlemen of that time. Under Louisiana law anyone who carried less than one-eighth Black blood could not be owned as a slave.</p>
<p>To create the one-eighth Black slaves, the breeder usually mated an Amerind male with a Black female. The female offspring of the Amerind/Black breedings were then bred to a White male to create one-fourth Black offspring. The female offspring of those breedings were also bred to a White male.</p>
<p>The one-eighth Black female slaves could sometimes pass as White. </p>
<p>Yeah, I know that such a breeding program sounds like a lot of trouble to go through to make a slave, but back when the most exquisite hand-made buggy with the finest Italian leather interior and a matched team cost less than $400, an attractive one-eighth Black bedroom servant who had been given training similar to finishing school could sell for $4000 at the balls the slavers put on to show off their wares.</p>
<p>My point is this, the &#8220;Black&#8221; guy in the article probably couldn&rsquo;t have been held as a slave in Louisiana at the height of slavery and I doubt that he will qualify for reparations if our guilt-ridden White liberals ever get around to handing it out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe he will qualify for reparations. The fact that he CHOSE to be Black indicates that he may have inherited a Black IQ.</p>

		<p>This is like the city that welcomes Farakhan while kicking out and condemning American Renaissance. It&rsquo;s great to be pro-black or pro-minority, and get in touch with your feelings as a minority, and anyone opposing you in this must be a bigot, but it&rsquo;s wrong and quite shameful to be pro-white or form a white racial identity. </p>

<p>This is the [black] family that abandoned you for 32 years, right?  You have a lot in common with Obama, guess it&rsquo;s chic now to discover and &#8220;embrace&#8221; African roots so you can cash in on Obama&rsquo;s coattails.  Better do it while you can, in a few years anything to do with Obama will be looked upon with scorn and derision. </p>

<p>Oh, NO, can&rsquo;t be identified with whites can you?  Even though you were raised in a society and culture created by whites.  As a 1/2 black what do you think your life would have been like in old Armenia?  Or Detroit where your father lives?</p>
<p>You are a lot like Obama.  Throw your &#8220;white&#8221; family under the bus, like he did, and embrace your black side.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;gotta have a gimmick, if ya wanna get ahead!&#8221;  And finally Mr. Fosberg, whose career was probably going nowhere, finds a great SCHTICK that will take him much farther than his intellect probably merits.</p>
<p>One of my oldest friends is an Octoroon from New Orleans (the vitriolic things she&hellip;like most any elite &#8216;High Yellow&rsquo; from that city&hellip; says about Blacks, will take the paint right off the wall), and she is far more identifiably &#8216;black&rsquo; than is Fosberg.  So, I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s a sixteenth, at most. </p>
<p>Even a smidgen of &#8216;black&rsquo; seems to make for an entirely different brain than Whites have, though.  Certain mental tasks seen to be just out of reach.  One has to wonder whether Mr. Fosberg grew up bitter, because he couldn&rsquo;t do Algebra (and thus had to go into a &#8216;creative&rsquo; field).</p>
<p>So, I can truly empathize with him, and almost feel his moment of epiphanic relief, upon discovering his &#8216;blackness&rsquo;&hellip;and, thus, HIS EXCUSE.</p>
<p>His excuse, and a meal ticket that will probably outlast any trust fund his adopted parents would leave him.  He&rsquo;ll be able to do the lecture circuit into old age.  No matter how lame his presentation, or how vapid its content, he will be in demand as a speaker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still puzzling, though, over what might be the &#8216;obstacles&rsquo; to blacks in 21st Century America that Fosberg&rsquo;s family is &#8216;thriving, in spite of&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>If you open the original article there&rsquo;s a picture of him that should strike someone immediately as being odd looking. Blacks like Mr. Fosberg have a peculiar idea of what White is if he thinks he can pass for one.  He could pass for not being black but he definitely doesn&rsquo;t look White.  If I hadn&rsquo;t known I would have guessed he was Middle Eastern. </p>

		<p>His story rings false to my ears, perhaps I am wrong but I suspect a hoax or embellishment.  In any event, what Whites should be taking away from this particular article is not only the constant media reinforcement of the idea that Blackness is something to celebrate while Whiteness is something to suppress, but the tone of the original source publication.</p>
<p>Click on the title of the article, and it will take you to the article on &#8220;The Root&#8221; website.  Click on the &#8220;Home&#8221; link, and examine the list of articles on the website.  Each and every one is focused on the African American experience, yet &#8220;The Root&#8221; would never receive the kind of condemnation that American Renaissance does.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Root&#8221; - another fine example of the atrocious double standard on race in our nation.</p>

		<p>I am happy for Mr. Fosberg - certainly, there is nothing the least bit odd about him feeling enriched by knowing about his father&rsquo;s side of the family.</p>
<p>nor is there anything the least bit odd about Europeans and European-American feeling excited and proud about their cultural heritage, nor Armenians, Jews, Arabs, Persians, or anyone else feeling excited about theirs.</p>
<p>what is very odd indeed is for Europeans or European Americans to feel squeamish about asserting their pride in their heritage, about preserving it, celebrating it, and protecting it from invaders - from people who have failed to create viable societies, and now want to crowded into ours. </p>
<p>what is incredibly bizarre is for whites to show even the slightest hesitation in openly and publicly asserting that they want to maintain white majorities in the societies they have created. </p>
<p>what is needed is Bill of Rights for the global European Community: </p>
<p>it should begin with the words:</p>
<p>An Unnoticed Minority, a new civil rights movement: <br>
The European community worldwide makes its demands known.</p>
<p>the priority should be protecting the indigenous territories of Europe from being overrun by an ocean of Africans, Muslims, and Asians.</p>
<p>for better or worse, the United States and Canada are multiracial societies - irrevocably.</p>
<p>there, the priority will be for whites to protect and preserve their own communities, to maintain white majorities in at least some regions of North America.</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still hope for the white homelands of Europe if a militant civil rights movement gathers force before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>all the really have to do in Europe is to pull the plug on the gargantuan social programs which subsidize immigrants and their astonishingly high birth rates - and perhaps bribe them to return to their homelands.</p>

<p>  Yes, Creoles have a better eye for subtle racial gradations. There&rsquo;s no doubt that many blacks have &#8220;passed&#8221; for white over the last two centuries in the Caribbean and Louisiana. It was to their advantage to do so. Beautiful, rich, or influential ones were even accepted into polite society. Now, being black is more profitable for these octoroons. I think Creoles know better than most whites the tragedy of race mixing and the lie of &#8220;great dream&#8221; of the elimination of racism through miscegenation.</p>
