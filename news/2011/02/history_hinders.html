<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oregon is one of only a dozen states where the majority of its residents aren&rsquo;t from there. {snip}</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s entire population is growing, but Portland is still about 80 percent white, making it one of the most homogeneous metropolitan cities in the country.</p>
<p>Many of the migrants don&rsquo;t have jobs, kids or a mortgage. So why do they keep coming?</p>
<p><b>&#8216;A Mecca for the Misplaced&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Portland has scooped up 20-somethings from shrinking cities in the Northeast and the Midwest. It gets the kids who dream of being in a rock band. But the city has also drawn well-educated young professionals</p>
<p>&#8220;Talent is becoming more concentrated in some cities and moving away from other cities,&#8221; says Joe Cortright, an economist standing in the rain at the food cart.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the percent of people with college degrees in Portland was lower than the national average. Now, it&rsquo;s more than 10 points higher  &mdash;  about 40 percent. And Cortright says the grads aren&rsquo;t just coming for high-tech jobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Fewer Jobs, Lower Pay, High Migration</b></p>
<p>Oregon economist Christian Kaylor says he can think of only one explanation for the migration into Portland: the quality of life.</p>
<p>Kaylor says wages there are sometimes 20 percent lower than in Seattle or San Francisco. But people keep coming. In fact, Portland&rsquo;s appeal is part of why the city&rsquo;s unemployment rate tends to be about a point higher than the national average.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recessions, Portland tends to see population growth, even as we lose jobs,&#8221; Kaylor says. &#8220;So one of the reasons we have that higher unemployment rate is because people do continue to move here even as jobs disappear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaylor says the city&rsquo;s strong brand as a livable place makes it more attractive to companies, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>History: What&rsquo;s Kept Portland White?</b></p>
<p>While Portland companies have a great pool of talent to draw on, it&rsquo;s not a diverse pool. Portland is still about 80 percent white. There are historical reasons for that.</p>
<p>Oregon voted to outlaw slavery, but for 75 years voters also banned blacks from moving there.</p>
<p>During World War II, thousands of African-Americans came to Portland to work in the booming shipyards. But in 1948, the Columbia River flooded and permanently destroyed the neighborhood where the shipbuilders lived.</p>
<p>Today, jobs that offer a livable wage are not in ships, but rather in chips and sneakers  &mdash;  Intel and Nike.</p>
<p>Enrique Washington helps these large firms recruit minority candidates. He says his clients want a diverse staff to help them innovate and connect to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more diverse culture you have, the better your stock prices do,&#8221; Washington says.</p>
<p>While other cities are getting browner, Washington is bucking the trend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Washington says Portland is slowly growing more diverse. There&rsquo;s a lot of international migration, and about 10 percent of the city is Hispanic. But he says minority recruits worry there&rsquo;s not a strong community to raise their children in if they relocate to Portland.</p>
<p><b>Struggling to Attract Diversity</b></p>
<p>Cities such as Portland that don&rsquo;t have much diversity to start with struggle to attract it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more diverse culture you have, the better your stock prices do,&rdquo; Washington says.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a bizarre imagination these diversicrats have!  It&rsquo;s exceeded only by the capacity of the twittering liberals at NPR to swallow it.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah  &mdash;  I did a Google search on &#8220;Enrique Washington,&#8221; and just as you already suspected, he&rsquo;s black.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But he says minority recruits worry there&rsquo;s not a strong community to raise their children in if they relocate to Portland.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh&hellip;  Sure.  I know that &#8220;having a strong community to raise their children in&#8221; is just Priority Number One for blacks and mestizos.</p>
<p>Or does that just mean they don&rsquo;t have enough of their own kind around to form proper gangs?</p>

		<p>Well the N.P.R. piece certainly isn&rsquo;t Color blind, or unbiased. &#8220;Diversity&#8221; is portrayed as an unchallenged Social Good. &#8220;Becoming Browner&#8221; like other American Cities is the way to go(apperantly). Portland is White and &#8220;Homogenous&#8221;. As if all Hispanic parts of Los Angeles and the South West are diverse and vibrant. They say that Minority candidates worry about raising Their Kids in such a White City? I suppose so much Whiteness will harm Their so called Minority Children.</p>

		<p>A number of years ago, I read an article whose thesis was that cheaper communications meant that people who engaged in certain professions really didn&rsquo;t need to live in a particular place, close to the physical place of employment.  Therefore, they could live where they want.</p>
<p>It went on to say that various communities around the country aren&rsquo;t necessarily becoming homogenized in that they look like every place else, they&rsquo;re becoming homogenized in that they&rsquo;re becoming more and more like themselves.  The article cited Boulder, Colorado   &mdash;   Long a haven for white leftists, it attracted even more white leftists, which attracted even more, ect.  </p>
<p>I suspect that Portland is remaining white liberal because of this kind of effect   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s a magnet for white liberals running away from the environments they created elsewhere in the Western third of the country.</p>

		<p>Yes, Portland, that&rsquo;s a very good plan. Bring in all the diversity you can. You shouldn&rsquo;t have much trouble attracting plenty of blacks and browns to your city. Just take a page from the Detroit play book.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. Your city won&rsquo;t end up looking like Detroit in 15 or 20 years just because you put out a bunch of honey to attract flies. Detroit looks the way it does because of racism and capitalism. Just ask any Black or liberal and they&rsquo;ll tell you the same. That once great city&rsquo;s blight had absolutely nothing to do with the unemployable, ineducable Blacks who flocked to Motown for the free stuff.</p>
<p>Bring in all of the blacks and browns you can get. The more you have, the less the rest of us have. </p>

		<p>If you need a diverse population to raise a family might I suggest the very affordable cities of Camden, NJ;  Trenton, NJ; Wilmington, DE; Philadelphia, PA; Newark, NJ.  Just a few I am familiar with and all with very low levels of pesky white people.  Well, Philadelphia still has a significant infection of whites but it is being taken care of.</p>
<p>What I can not understand is why some whites prattle on and on about how important diversity is yet there is example after example of how diversity has destroyed city after city in this country.  How can you be hit in the head with a hammer, over and over again, and not feel the pain?  How does this sort of insanity infect so many people?  I can not understand it!</p>
<p>As an example is NJ Governor Christie.  He has the right idea about cutting spending and reigning in the cost of government but he blames the teachers union for &ldquo;our&rdquo; failing schools.  The &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; blame the union makes about as much sense as the liberal mantra &ldquo;the schools are under funded&rdquo;.  And he doesn&rsquo;t think that illegal aliens have broken any laws!  While I am glad he is governor I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want him as president.  Do any of the politicians understand the world they are leaving their white children?<br>

<p>Friend who moved to Portland: &#8216;you know, I hate to say it, but it&rsquo;s nice how white it is here. I&rsquo;m glad to not have to dal with the tension in [other cite] any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Friend who moved out of Portland: &#8216;it&rsquo;s too white. I need to see a face like mine more than once a day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Friend who moved out of Portland: &#8216;I love it but the Mexicans ruined my neighborhood.&rsquo;</p>

I was on line reading comments posted by uber liberals to an article.</p>
<p>One liberal &#8216;progressive&rsquo; who knew all about hate, discrimination, and racism gave his hometown in Washington state (Kings County).</p>
<p>I looked it up and it had 85% white, 8% Asian, 1.50% black, 4% Hispanic and then others.</p>
<p>The largest minority were Asians who are not a troublesome group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder liberals and &#8216;progressive&rsquo; are out of touch with reality.<br>

Uh-huh. Care to back that up with statistics? I&rsquo;d place 50% odds that he fabricated that claim out of whole cloth, 40% that it was based on a flawed study, 5% that it&rsquo;s based on an erroneous reading of some other study, and 5% that &#8220;diverse&#8221; companies actually do have higher stock prices, because they get cozy government contracts, rather than because they&rsquo;re more productive.</p>

		<p>Liberals like all the SWPL stuff that goes with living in a city with the demographics of Portland, OR, not the that it&rsquo;s lily white. To remain a post-modern liberal, most libs have to live apart from other races, otherwise they will be mugged into racial reality. The cognitive dissonance is far too strong to deny anybody with average intelligence that spends a significant time around large black/brown populations.          </p>

		<p>Do you want to know what happens to white people when diversity comes in and they become a minority?  The Providence, RI school board, which is almost all latino (how did that happen?) just voted to fire every one of the 2000 teachers in the district because the &#8216;students&rsquo; (almost all latino and black) are doing so poorly.  Can you guess the race of the majority of the teachers?  Almost all white.  Now the latinos ruined the careers of 2000 white people just because little jose can&rsquo;t learn english.  The link is here and it shows all the latino board members who voted.  The one white man on the board bravely voted no..  I urge Amren to take this up.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t SERIOUSLY think non whites come to any particular city for the JOBS do you?? Being mostly white the non Whites (particularly black males) come to those places for access to White women and next would be the WELFARE! (correlation: no welfare/entitlements, no non Whites) I have read and heard that there are actually sites that rate the welfare and entitlements offered in various places (I have not looked them up though)OH! almost forgot, the next most popular reason for non whites to move to a White area is the better market for their drug dealing, sad, but all to true.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a native Oregonian from the capital city. The differences between Portland and here are staggering. Portland is a magnet for liberals and hipsters throughout the country. There isn&rsquo;t a single real man among them. </p>
<p>We recently had an economist speak here and someone asked him why Oregon continues to have high unemployment compared to other states and he said the same thing: that Oregon draws in so many people for the lifestyle who aren&rsquo;t necessarily looking for work. </p>
<p>A few weekends ago I was in Portland in one of the trendy hipster districts. There were a few blacks who stood out like a lion in a field of zebras. I was walking with my friend and one said &#8216;Hey&rsquo;. I turned around and he was asking me to buy a watch. I said &#8216;No thanks I&rsquo;ve already got one&rsquo;. These people are the permenent underclass. The cartoonish and marginalized.  <br>
