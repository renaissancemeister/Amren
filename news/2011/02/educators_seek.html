<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110221/US.Study.Abroad.Minorities/">Educators Seek Out More Minorities to Study Abroad</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathy Matheson, Comcast News, February 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Educators want more minority students to follow the lead of [Sade] Adeyina, an African-American graphic design major. Foreign study is seen as crucial to student development and even as a key to national security, yet minority participation badly lags their overall presence on college campuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really a matter of persuading young students of color that this is possible for them and this is necessary for them,&#8221; said Peggy Blumenthal, executive vice president of the Institute of International Education. &#8220;You come back changed, more self-confident.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 81 percent of study-abroad students are white, although whites represent 63 percent of enrollment in higher education, according to 2008-09 data released in November by the New York-based institute.</p>
<p>Blacks comprise 4.2 percent of study-abroad students but are 13.5 percent of the college population. Latinos are 6 percent of study-abroad participants but nearly 12 percent of higher ed students. Asian-Americans, representing 6.8 percent of college students, are slightly overrepresented in study abroad at 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Barriers often include lack of funds, fear of racism, worries about delayed graduation, and few role models  &mdash;  either family or faculty  &mdash;  who have traveled abroad.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Congress began to address the disparity with the federally funded Gilman scholarship, which has provided study-abroad funds for low-income Pell Grant recipients since 2001. About 55 percent of last year&rsquo;s Gilman scholars were minorities, according to the Institute of International Education, which administers the program.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wants to expand foreign learning opportunities overall with a bill to create the $80 million Sen. Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation, a public-private entity that would award grants to students and institutions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Expanding study abroad should be a national priority,&#8221; Durbin said in 2009 while re-introducing the legislation, which has yet to win full congressional approval. &#8220;The future of the country depends on globally literate citizens who are at ease in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January, North Carolina A&T; State University began working with the American Council on Education to promote international learning at historically black institutions, a project partly funded by the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the efforts at A&T; is a new annual $10 student fee to create an international education fund that offsets study abroad expenses. {snip}</p>
<p>At Temple, about 9 percent of students in the study-abroad program are black, more than double the national average. About 11 percent are Asian, also above average, while the 5 percent Hispanic involvement is slightly below the norm.</p>

		<p>The problem is, people in host countries still think of americans as being white.  When shaquanda shows up at the airport with her diva self and head rolling, the generous Chen family from Shanghai does a double take.</p>

		<p>I have met several blacks that have studied abroad, some were here in the U.S. and some while I was in Europe last time.  Here are a few things I noticed:  9 out of 10 blacks want to go to Italy (I especially hate that one since I am full blooded Italian).  They refuse to go anywhere in Africa.  They do not even want to go to countries that are white with visible minorities (England, France).  And here are the things I noticed when they return:  Everyone is Europe is racist.  The girls are prude (not true, they just hate blacks).  No one would talk to them or help them out.  They still want to be around white people.</p>
<p>I say if we are going to cut them special breaks (which we shouldn&rsquo;t) we send them to Russia where they will get severely harassed and beaten, China or Korea where they will get severely harassed and beaten, or Saudi Arabia where they will probably get killed.  This way they won&rsquo;t complain about taxpayers giving them a free ride abroad.  But it is wrong that ANY of this should be paid for with taxes.  We are almost to the point where we are going to give them the option of working all together (more so than now).  And how is studying abroad in Europe going to help their job skills?  Like it&rsquo;ll help them be less lazy at their AA job with some govt. branch?</p>

		<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m certain that&rsquo;s just what foreign countries want   &mdash;   lots of our exported blacks and mestizos.  Yeah, I&rsquo;m positive we&rsquo;ll make friends in faraway places by doing that.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;You come back changed, more self-confident,&#8221;</i> tweets one Peggy Blumenthal joyously.  Well, Peggy, if that&rsquo;s the case, why aren&rsquo;t you sending <i>everyone</i> abroad, to become changed and self-confident?  Or does this mystical transformation only affect those with the right skin color?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Barriers often include lack of funds&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation: &#8220;We want the White taxpayers to foot the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&hellip;fear of racism&hellip;</i></p>
<p>But I thought it was that wicked &#8220;America&#8221; that was the sinkhole of Racism.  You&rsquo;d think those poor, downtrodden minorities would be delighted to get out of this disgusting and Oppressive country for a while.</p>
<p>Could it possibly be that the <i>real</i> fear is that they won&rsquo;t be treated with the same Guilty Liberal deference to which they&rsquo;ve become so accustomed on these shores?</p>
<p><i>&hellip;worries about delayed graduation&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Why?  Do the <i>White</i> exchange students worry about &#8220;delayed graduation?&#8221;  Why is it that only our delicate Minorities agonize over such things?</p>
<p><i>&hellip;and few role models &mdash; either family or faculty &mdash; who have traveled abroad.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that ole &#8220;role models&#8221; devil again!  It seems that blacks always have to have a &#8220;role model&#8221; to show them how to do just about anything.  Er&hellip;do <i>White</i> exchange students require &#8220;role models&#8221; in their families before they can leave the country?  No?  Then just what is it that makes blacks so terribly, terribly sensitive?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know just what exactly this &#8220;Institute of International Education&#8221; is, to have have garnered such glowing attention from Comcast News.  But I think I can guess.</p>

		<p>I almost feel like saying &#8220;just don&rsquo;t send them here!&#8221;</p>
<p>I am sure they will be just as &#8220;welcome&#8221; at all the great English and European universities as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps they can be sent to African or Indian Universities, could be an interesting way to promote the exchange of ideas and to see how low income students fare in such places.<br>

<p>In the case of Afro-Americans going to non-English speaking countries, add the challenging burden of learning a new language.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m all for this initiative to the extent that Afro-Americans do their semester abroad in sub-Sahara Africa.</p>

		<p>And I had always thought that American students studying abroad were supposed to be goodwill ambassadors? We don&rsquo;t want to give foreigners unfavorable impressions of the USA.</p>
<p>Sending &#8216;dusky yoofs&rsquo; abroad could start a trend. Maybe countries like Finland will start sending us their duskies as well, instead of their hot blond chick-a-dees.</p>
