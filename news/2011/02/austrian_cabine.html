<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20110222/EU.Austria.Rules.for.Foreigners/">Austrian Cabinet Adopts New Rules for Foreigners</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Veronika Oleksyn, Comcast News, February 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Austria&rsquo;s Cabinet on Tuesday approved new immigration and asylum rules, amid criticism from the United Nations and others.</p>
<p>Some of the new measures will see asylum seekers confined to special centers for up to seven days on arrival while their refugee status is analyzed, while others require some immigrants to have German proficiency before entering the country.</p>
<p>In a statement, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees expressed concern about the confinement aspects of the new measures, saying this was equal to &#8220;detention with the doors open,&#8221; since those who fail to comply face deportation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interior Minister Maria Fekter, a hard-liner on issues relating to asylum, said the requirement will prevent people from disappearing while they await word on whether they&rsquo;re allowed to stay in the country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the new rules, Cabinet members say a new &#8220;red-white-red&#8221; work permit will make it easier for more qualified foreigners from outside the European Union to fill gaps left by an aging labor force.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Minister Rudolf Hundstorfer said it will allow non-EU citizens to apply for the jobs Austria is having a problem filling. It is currently very difficult for non-EU foreigners to work in Austria legally because employers need to justify taking a non-EU citizen over locals and other EU citizens.</p>

		<p>This is of course nearly not enough in the fight against immigration and for the salvation of our homelands, but it shows that a pro-White party does not have to necessarily obtain 60% of the vote to be effective, but could be significant just by obtaining enough to place pressure on the government.</p>

<p>If they bring in foreign workers to work jobs where there is currently a shortage of workers then it will only suppress the wages and prevent local workers from entering that field. </p>
<p>But, then, what exactly do they consider a &#8220;shortage&#8221;? Any job where they have to pay a decent wage! Businesses won&rsquo;t be happy until they&rsquo;ve flooded the job market with foreigners and driven all the locals out of the field altogether. One sees that with the construction workers in America. There was never a shortage until they hired cheap illegal labor.</p>

		<p>Europe in many ways have much more potential since you can affect the political system much earlier. It&rsquo;s enough with between 2-5 % of the vote, depending on what country, to gain influence. Once you get past 10 %, you&rsquo;re a serious force.</p>
<p>The American system is much easier to control from an Ã©lite perspective, since the needed barrier is so staggeringly high that you either need to infiltrate the current party(ies) or basically break the system.</p>
<p>Both are very hard. </p>
<p>What European parties are doing now was called fascism 5 years ago. What&rsquo;s fascism today is repritation(essentially transfering out the non-European population).</p>
<p>Sarko is alrady pushing for severe immigration laws, ditto the UK. In Denmark, the muslim population is actually declining due to a net exodus, as well as conversions.</p>
<p>10 years ago in Denmark, more ethnic christian Danes were converting to islam than the other way around, today almost no ethnic danes convert, most of those who have converted go back and many Arab muslims convert.</p>
<p>The trends are accelerating.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s lost though. The narrow window of opportunity was in the 80s. Europe is where the U.S. was in the 1980s. In Sweden, 75 % of the population is ethnically Swedish, but 5 % if ethnically finnish, and another 7-10 % is European. <br>
Only around 10-13 % is actually non-European, and Sweden has the most extreme immigration &#8216;laws&rsquo; in Europe. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more worried about America, which essentially is turning to a big South Africa. You guys are past the point of a gradual reform if you actually want to keep the country European.</p>
<p>In the under-3 children alive in America today, less than half are white. Even if all immigration stops, you&rsquo;re already doomed unless you do nothing.</p>
<p>The problem is that you&rsquo;d basically need a revolution so bloody it will make the Nazis pale by comparison and that&rsquo;s ruled out since the entire mass media is essentially anti-European. </p>
<p>The U.S. had a good run but now you guys are finished. Concentrate to the northern states and bide your time, others can come back to your homelands in the European homeland, or move to Australia or Canada. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no future for you over there, at least not now. Perhaps we can re-colonize it in some of the decades to come. </p>

		<p>Anonymous #4: Do not despair the fate of America! The only REAL &#8220;American exceptionalism&#8221; that matters is that the white folk are exceedingly well-armed and prone to violence. But the resolution and reckoning will not be pretty&hellip;that is for certain.   </p>

<p>I get so sick of gloom and doom predictions like this! Morbid pessimists like you are no help to us at all.  Do you get a kick out of telling us that all is lost?  You would have had a party on the Titanic, telling those poor souls that they were doomed! Yeah, rub it in real good.</p>
<p>As for Moslems converting to Christianity (or to anything else) that doesn&rsquo;t interest me either.  So what?  When Somalis and North Africans become Christians, do they become acceptable  and are now transformed into white Europeans?  Nonsense! They are STILL Somalis and Algerians &hellip; and always will be!  For your information, Amren  is a site about RACE realism, not religion. You can keep your converts.</p>
<p>And we should all move to Canada?  Do you really think that the  situation in Canada is any better than the USA? Have you been there?  I&rsquo;d say its even worse. It&rsquo;s jumping from the frying pan into the fire.</p>
