			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Debra J. Saunders, San Francisco Chronicle, February 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When he was in his residency, studying psychiatry at Walter Reed Army Medical Center from 2003 to 2009, Nidal Hasan gave a lecture in which he defended Osama bin Laden, justified suicide bombers and suggested that Muslim Americans in the military  &mdash;  like him  &mdash;  could be prone to fratricidal attacks against fellow troops.</p>
<p>He was &#8220;a chronic poor performer,&#8221; who often failed to show up for work and was often on probation. His program director considered him &#8220;very lazy&#8221; and &#8220;a religious fanatic.&#8221;</p>
<p>His superiors described the first draft of a presentation needed to complete his residency as &#8220;not scientific,&#8221; &#8220;not scholarly&#8221;  &mdash;  but a rehash of Quoranic verses with no mention of a single medical or psychiatric term. Another presentation  &mdash;  in which he charged that U.S. operations abroad were part of a war against Islam  &mdash;  so angered his colleagues that an instructor stopped the speech. And yet the Army consistently gave Hasan positive evaluations and promoted him to major in 2009. </p>
<p>So says the Senate Homeland Security and Government Oversight Committee in a report released last week by Chairman Joe Lieberman and ranking Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the report found that military culture was  &mdash;  and I would add, is  &mdash;  unprepared to take on the challenge. The fear of being accused of anti-Muslim discrimination, bureaucratic lethargy and even the Army&rsquo;s insistence on keeping a poor candidate in a fellowship program rather than lose the slot, all worked to shield an officer whom an instructor and colleague branded a &#8220;ticking time bomb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Political correctness clearly reigns in the military after this bloody lesson. Last year, the Pentagon released a report, &#8220;Protecting the Force: Lessons from Fort Hood,&#8221; which never once referred to Islamist extremism. The report instead concentrated on workplace violence, even touting the U.S. Postal Service&rsquo;s program to end workplace violence as the sort of program that could prevent another attack.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Togo West explained, &#8220;Our concern is with actions and effects, not necessarily with motivations.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This attitude of the PC guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t in the USA of burying their heads in the sand and encouraging the American people to do the same, with regard to Islam, has to stop.  This horrendous incident at Ft. Hood is just the beginning.  I am going to share a link here from a site that lets everyone know exactly what Islam is and what it stands for.  If you are squeamish or not in full possession of your faculties, DO NOT WATCH this video, and under NO circumstances allow ANYONE under the age of 18 to watch it:</p>

<p>A comment by Army Chief of Staff General George Casey seems to explain both those &#8220;positive evaluations&#8221; for Hasan and this particular general&rsquo;s rapid rise through the ranks:  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our diversity, not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.  And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that&rsquo;s worse.&rdquo; The remarks of Army Chief of Staff General George Casey three days after Major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 U. S. soldiers and wounded 32 more on Nov. 5, 2005. </p>

		<p>There is no possible way that our officials do not understand the dangers that Islam is causing. People like Togo West are told to say such stupid things to censor the knowledge of the population, because they are not able to make a complete enemy of Islam without also disintegrating multiculturalism.</p>

When a veteran comes back from Iraq or Afghanistan,the last thing he or she wants to see is a Muslim or anyone who looks middle eastern treat him or her at a hospital.</p>
<p>Remember what the Iraqis did to Scott Halvenston.<br>
1,000 Iraqis couldnt equal one Scott Halvenston.</p>
<p>Why should one Muslim be allowed to participate in treating thousands of men and women when they believe that the sword is the key to heaven?</p>

I had to check if there was really somebody named &#8220;Togo West&#8221;*. And there is! And he&rsquo;s a Clinton appointee! And he&rsquo;s 68 years old and he&rsquo;s still getting plum assignments like assessing the Ft. Hood shooting without once mentioning Islamism! </p>
<p>Want to see what a &#8220;Togo West&#8221; looks like? C&rsquo;mon, admit it, you&rsquo;re dying to know: </p>

		<p>Islam is not &#8220;the enemy&#8221;, Liberalism is the enemy, islam and muslims have different interests and loyalties, only a retard would expect them to magically integrate and become americans.</p>
<p>It is the same with asians, jews, blacks, mexicans, and so on, all of them are different races and groups. </p>
<p>Sure islam is more rabidly and openly anti-white, but all other races are INTRINSICALLY opposed to us by being different. Diversity is death of whites. </p>

<p>The headline is wrong. The PC military did detect the Ft Hood shooter. They just failed to act appropriately. Instead of discharging him, they just transferred him to other commands. </p>

		<p>I know full well the futility of producing a poor evaluation for a member of any protected group. I routinely had negative OER&rsquo;s returned with the comment &#8220;sharpen your pencil&#8221; for protected classes. Rarely a blink for faulting the average Joe. The only solution was to damm with faint praise the worst offenders and lavishly praise the merely mediocre. This is not to say there were not excellent protected class officers. I am simply pointing out that doing virtually anything about the ash and trash was difficult at best. I am truly glad I am done and will send none of my children to the recruiters.</p>

&#8220;To be immersed in the Department for any length of time is to know with absolute certainty that the battle of ideas, for the highest seat of power, for the basic outlook of the United States of America is over and it has been won by globalist, multi-culturalist, liberal capitalism. That is to say, the USG is currently fanatically devoted to a world-view that can best be described in shorthand as a mix between the Wall St Journal pro-global business and open borders stance and the ideology one would find in the Office for Multi-Cultural Affairs at a major liberal arts university.&#8221;<br>
(&hellip;)<br>
&#8220;this view has hardened into an ideology and has intertwined itself so thoroughly in the popular mind with what it means to be &ldquo;American&rdquo; that nothing short of an intense crisis or a complete breakdown will bring about any change. Certainly, electing this or that Republican makes no difference to the Permanent Government.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Nothing really new here.  Since the Vietnam war the US Army has been infested with &#8220;PC&#8221; officers.  This has festered until you see things like the Ft Hood incident and still you hear the &#8220;PC&#8221; answers.  The late Col David Hackworth (USA-Ret) had these &#8220;PC&#8221; folks pegged correctly and he was not welcomed among the senior staff of the Army.  Such a shame what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>

		<p>The tragedy is that, according to his attorney: ex-JAG Colonel John P. Halligan, there will be an insanity plea and because the Army repeatedly overlooked his extremist religious views as -either- seditious (Article 94 breach) or the marks of treatable personality issues _which a white officer would have been instantly subject to forced counseling and/or loss of rank for advocating_, Hassan will likely get his padded nuthouse.</p>
<p>What this means is that Hassan&rsquo;s Article 32 hearing will be a formality upon whose outcome will be based all further actions in the court martial, including a psychological evaluation for insanity.  Since a death penalty case is a given because of the aggravated nature and number of murders as &#8216;grievous intent&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s just a question of whether the U.S. Army decides they want to bury the case or lose it.</p>
<p>Update: according to Wiki, in late November Galligan actually quit the defense case and both sides refused to present summary arguments in the Article 32 (pretrial) hearing after the DOD refused to supply Halligan intelligence analyses of Hassan&rsquo;s shooting spree and jacket psychology evaluations from deposed officers in his chain of command.</p>
<p>So it becomes even easier to introduce a circumstantial defense as &#8216;inadequate representation&rsquo; issue that gives Hassan a chance at life in prison.</p>
<p>And how expensive is it to pay for the care and feeding of an paraplegic man in prison?  Good question: 207,000 dollars for a six month stay in the Bell County jail.  Off the federal reserve installation where the guards have to have guards to keep from throttling him in his sleep.</p>

		<p>The military did not &#8220;fail to detect&#8221; this psychopath.  They detected his malfunction and then proceeded to deliberately ignore it.</p>
<p>PFC Michael Manning of Wikileaks infamy used to throw chairs at co-workers and yell at superiors, yet he was not given a bad-conduct discharge, either.  Instead, he was given access to classified information.  </p>
