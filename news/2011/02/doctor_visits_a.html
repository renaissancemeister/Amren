<h1><a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/215165.php">Doctor Visits Are Often a Bad Experience for African American Men</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Bailey, Medical News Today, January 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A majority of African American men said they do not go to the doctor because visits are stressful and physicians don&rsquo;t give adequate information on how to make prescribed behavior or lifestyle changes, a new University of Michigan study shows.</p>
<p>When they did go, the majority of the 105 men questioned said they disliked the tone physicians used with them. When those men did visit the doctor, they said it was because they were seeking test results or their family encouraged them to go.</p>
<p>Men often said they knew they needed to lose weight, change eating habits or become more physically active before visiting the doctor. They hoped the doctor would help them figure out how to make those behavioral and lifestyle changes without sacrificing time with spouses and children. The men in the focus groups explained that adopting healthy behaviors was more complex than simple motivation and that doctors didn&rsquo;t understand that a healthier lifestyle meant the men had to give up other meaningful activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s usually not the story that&rsquo;s told,&#8221; said Derek Griffith, assistant professor in the U-M School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study. Julie Ober Allen and Katie Gunter of U-M SPH are co-authors.</p>

		<p>Black males always think they&rsquo;re being disrespected and always have to be the ones telling others what to do, no matter the situation.  Even when they aren&rsquo;t the boss, they always act like they are and I guess they take this with them even into the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>

We know how stressful it is for lil&rsquo; king DeShaun to follow the instructions of a white doctor like the humiliating &#8220;breath in and breath out&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><i>
&#8220;They hoped the doctor would help them figure out how to make those behavioral and lifestyle changes without sacrificing time with spouses and children.&#8221;</i>
</blockquote>
Because we all know there is nothing more important to black men than spending time with their beloved children.
<blockquote><i> and that doctors didn&rsquo;t understand that a healthier lifestyle meant the men had to give up other meaningful activities.
</i></blockquote>
White doctors just &#8220;don&rsquo;t get it&#8221;. Black men have to spend time with their children, their wifes and for the job to pay taxes and be good parents. That is why so many are unhealthier than white men because the majority of white men are not doing those things.

		<p>That article was one of the dumbest I have read in a while.  Who cares if you don&rsquo;t like the tone of the doctor.  The doctor is probably tired of telling them the same things over and over again.  They tell these idiots what is wrong, give them medications to take (which they don&rsquo;t), and tell them to be more active.  If you want a lifestyle coach, watch Oprah or the Biggest Loser and save the physician the stress of your useless office visit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;that a healthier lifestyle meant the men had to give up other meaningful activities.&#8221;  Like hanging out at the barber shop and drinking malt liquor?  Its been my experience that unless a black is directly involved in sports, ie. basketball, football, etc., they are totally uninterested in physical activity.  I have several black friends and am always trying to get them to join me for a bike ride or something.  Not happening. Guess its a white thing.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the tone of physicians that are making black men avoid them.  *roll eyes*  Just another excuse black people use to avoid responsibility.  In every article about black people there is finger pointing, you have to look out for it, black people don&rsquo;t like responsibility.</p>

<p>I am a white man, and I have problems with minority doctors. They don&rsquo;t listen to what I am telling them. Sounds like the shoe is on the opposite foot, or maybe minorities just don&rsquo;t like listening to white men regardless of which side of the stethascope they are on.</p>

		<p>What the doctors are probably saying, and these upstanding members of the community don&rsquo;t want to hear is, they need to take responsibility for their own well-being.  Liquor, dope, smoking, chasing women, etc., can&rsquo;t be blamed on da white man, so they don&rsquo;t want to hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those raciss&rsquo; white docs need them some diversitee trainen&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be papers written how blacks need doctors &#8216;who look like them&rsquo; and then more affirmative action docs will be created.</p>
<p>White liberals will cry tears of shame and demand that hospitals hire only men of color to treat those noble men of the &#8216;hood.</p>
<p>And on it goes until the medicine profession is destroyed, just like they&rsquo;re on the verge of destroying public education in this country.</p>

		<p>More proof that Blacks are, in so many ways, little more than overgrown children! Whites would, of course, be relentlessly mocked and ridiculed for saying such things, but those poor, poor sensitive Black males must be treated with kid gloves it seems. Sort of puts the lie to their big, tough &#8220;thug&#8221; affectation they love to employ, does it not?  </p>

<p>If they know what to do and they aren&rsquo;t doing it then a doctor isn&rsquo;t going to help. It&rsquo;s a simple matter of <i>impulse control</i> and blacks appear to be deficient in this area. Of course, if a doctor told them this then they probably wouldn&rsquo;t like his &#8220;tone&#8221;.</p>

<p>What that means is that the physician has an actual postgraduate education, while such patients probably have a fourth grade reading level. </p>
<p><i>When those men did visit the doctor, they said it was because they were seeking test results or their family encouraged them to go.</i></p>
<p>Or there was some monetary reward involved, like a few pilot programs out of New York.</p>
<p><i>They hoped the doctor would help them figure out how to make those behavioral and lifestyle changes without sacrificing time with spouses and children.</i></p>
<p>You mean they found 105 black men who are within the confines of a traditional nuclear family?  Honestly, these men want to know how to get better and keep their drug habits at the same time.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry fellas, there&rsquo;s always hoodoo and voodoo. Love how this article is framed, as if white doctors are acting any differently towards their black patients. It&rsquo;s like the Eddie Murphy skit from SNL 25 years ago, where as soon as the black person leaves all the white people get up and dance in jubilation and give each other free stuff. Sorry fellas, my doctor doesn&rsquo;t outline my diet nor does he give me exercise training advice. </p>

		<p>And when the black men goes over the age of forty years, he knows that a doctor visit will mean, more often than not, and the doctor will insist, upon doing the digital rectal exam.</p>
<p>Very important to the health of a man over the age of forty, but a procedure of great fear for the black man. Black men as a group are deathly afraid of the digital rectal exam.</p>
<p>The black man believes that the digital rectal exam is the same as being homosexually violated, with all that means to the black man.</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY, I WOULD SUSPECT, IF THE EXAM IS DONE BY A WHITE DOCTOR.</p>
<p>The black man is now, in his own mind, A LESSER of a man for what has been done to him, purpose not being relevant.</p>
<p>This is one reason, perhaps the main reason, why black men skip fundamental and basic medical care, and die an inordinate number of deaths from prostate cancer, among other illnesses. NOT because of lack of medical care and not because white doctors do not care, etc.</p>
<p>And this has nothing to do with the so-called Tuskegee &#8220;Experiment&#8221; [Study] or anything like that. Just a warped mentality looking at something in a warped manner.</p>
<p>Maybe if the black men ONLY went to black men doctors? That would be better?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a primary care physician, in practice some 20+ years, and in the midwest. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent about a third of my career in &#8220;urban health&#8221; and with &#8220;underserved populations,&#8221; both PC names for black patients. I&rsquo;ve treated blacks in ambulatory care facilities, teaching hospitals, ERs, free clinics, and so on.</p>
<p>I treat every person the same - with the goal of preserving health/preventing disease and/or diagnosing and treating the illness or injury.</p>
<p>I have made a number of observations.</p>
<p>First, blacks have limited cognitive skills. Often, you have to approach them as if they are 12 year old white children. </p>
<p>It matters little, many times, what you say or how you say it. They have a restricted attention span and weak memories - so you end up saying the same thing over and over at each visit. </p>
<p>Patient literature is useless - they won&rsquo;t read it, nor even understand it no matter how dumbed down it is.</p>
<p>Many black men have absolutely no idea what medication they are taking, or what it is for, and I have to assume that no matter what the chart says they aren&rsquo;t being compliant to begin with.</p>
<p>Black men usually do not see physicians unless dragged to a clinic or hospital by a spouse (rare for any number of reasons) or by EMTs for some acute problem frequently related to violence or poor health (like an fight or car accident or a gunshot or a stroke&hellip;).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully agree that black men find the tone of the doctor disrespectful or they are unhappy with the information provided. That is bogus.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this published report is a smokescreen to cover-up black failings and lack of responsibility. Instead of actually stating the reason blacks have higher rates of just about every preventable illness - because of poor personal health habits - the authors blame the doctor (read: white doctor) so therefore, the black man is not at fault.</p>
<p>From the article:<br>
&#8220;Men often said they knew they needed to lose weight, change eating habits or become more physically active before visiting the doctor. They hoped the doctor would help them figure out how to make those behavioral and lifestyle changes without sacrificing time with spouses and children.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a crock of nonsense. If it wasn&rsquo;t so sad it would be funny. And you&rsquo;re telling me they can&rsquo;t figure out those simple steps on their own? Besides, doctors are not the only source of information. There are unlimited resources to search for improving one&rsquo;s health. What do they want the doctor to do? Cook their food and feed them? </p>
<p>Grow up. Take some responsibility.</p>
<p>The black male knows he shouldn&rsquo;t eat at McDonald&rsquo;s every day, drink all night, and smoke. So don&rsquo;t do it - or at least do it in moderation. Because blacks are have limited brainpower they are unable to quantify risk or look beyond next week. They are unable to understand diabetes or hypertension. They have sickening and outrageous rates of STDs that even an idiot could prevent with 10 seconds effort and perhaps some self-control.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s the doctor&rsquo;s fault they don&rsquo;t have a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t given up trying to help - but by now it&rsquo;s obvious not much will change. If you live by the sword of bad health you die by the sword of bad health.</p>
<p>I could write a book covering the insane and crazy interactions with blacks and their nearly complete lack of understanding related to maintaining their own health. </p>
<p>In essence, the bottom line is low intelligence and limited self-control. That&rsquo;s hard-wired. And I don&rsquo;t think the wires can be changed.</p>

		<p>Oh yeah, doctors are just a joy to visit. I go to mine regularly for the hell of it. Oh! and my dentist too! I just love having a 6&rsquo;6&#8221; bald guy climb into my mouth for an hour. That&rsquo;s much better than my doctors vampire who always wants her quart. And the drugs! I don&rsquo;t have anything better to do with $700 a month than visit my Walmart Superstore.</p>

<p>The reason is very simple to understand.</p>
<p>Most blacks have the IQ of children. When white people talk to them, they perceive the white person is talking above their level.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t like to be around blacks, I get along very good with blacks. The trick is to not talk above them. Keep your words and ideas simple. Feel them out for their opinions first and then agree with them and keep the conversation short. That way, they think of you as &#8216;one of the good ones&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>Dr Visits- Thank you for the great post. The most enlightening things I have read on Amren are posts like yours, from people who deal with the problem on a day to day basis. The diversity nonsense quicly melts away when one is confronted with the reality of the situation. You should consider writing a story for American Renaissance magazine.</p>

		<p>Comment number one reveals something about the our culture and what has happened to it.</p>
<p>I assume the writer is white, but he uses the word disrespect as a verb; that is a black construction, an Africanism that has crept into the language. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s preserve our language and our culture.</p>
<p>You show disrespect for someone, or someone did not show respect for you, but if you read the writings of white people for the past 500 years, you will not likely find disrespect used as a verb until very recently.  It started with blacks, and should end with them.</p>
<p>There is a whole list of such words and expressions that we should teach our children not to adopt:  onliest instead of only; omitting the verb, as in &#8220;She fine.&#8221;; and all the other Ebonics babble.</p>
<p>And, speaking of culture, I am sick of white people wanting go give me the ghetto handshake, or fist bump.  Even the old &#8220;give me five&#8221; of my parents generation, used by jazz musicians, should be abandoned by white people.  Maybe it was cute in 1955, before our culture was so badly damaged, but not anymore, so we need to draw the line.  When people try to greet me with anything other than the traditional handshake, I just say, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t do that.&#8221;  If they are rude enough to demand an explanation, I just tell them it is not part of my culture.<br>
 <br>
When most white people think about it, they don&rsquo;t really want to talk and behave like blacks.</p>
<p>And, other than in some movies and Broadway shows, where can you hear music that is of white racial origin anymore?  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s preserve our heritage; it is the best in the world.</p>

<p>Tell me one thing that blacks do that they are responsible for?<br>
One thing that the Evil White Man isn&rsquo;t totally to blame for?<br>
Heck according to them, they invented just about everything, and have the finest minds on the planet, they are master builders and politicians (Well if you don&rsquo;t look at Detroit, Oakland, Atlanta and so forth that is) <br>
NO blacks for whatever reason have become a thorn in the side of humanity and humanity not only allows but feeds this situation.<br>
The CDC says blacks being only 12.5% of the American population have over 65% of all aids/hiv, but the blacks say NO this is a white mans lie. Can you ever win an argument with a headstrong child?</p>

		<p>I can think of only one thing more horrendous than being a doctor having to inspect all the nooks, crannies and orifices of a black body in an intimate manner. [shudder!!] Given the outward appearances of many of them as well as the odor and the expected level of cleanliness and sanitation in their personal habits, I can&rsquo;t begin to imagine the horrors witnessed by doctors. I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of whites that I would hate to examine as a doctor; the number of blacks would be insurmountable.</p>

		<p>As an older white male, I don&rsquo;t much like going to doctors either. Not because of the way they talk to me, but because of their attitude that the patient is required to do as they say, or you are a &#8220;bad patient&#8221;.

		<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t like the tone of their doctors?  Funny, I don&rsquo;t like blacks committing so many crimes, I don&rsquo;t like hearing blacks complaining, I don&rsquo;t like blacks&rsquo; sense of entitlement, I don&rsquo;t like blacks&rsquo; hatred of whites, I don&rsquo;t like blacks blaming others for their problems, I don&rsquo;t like all the acts of violence blacks commit against whites, I don&rsquo;t like how blacks don&rsquo;t plan ahead, I don&rsquo;t like how blacks are irresponsible, I don&rsquo;t like how black men act like responsible fathers, I don&rsquo;t like blacks&rsquo; suing whites either. </p>

		<p>#24 Roger Lee, you are so right. It&rsquo;s kin to the way new words are created - whites mocking black terminology create new words that become standard usage. Like edumacation and gradumacate. But my favorite is &#8216;conversate.&rsquo;   EG: &#8220;We was, ya know, conversatin&rsquo; &#8216;bout how bad we was treated.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am a medical transcriptionist. If I had no professional ethics or enlightened self-interest, I could reproduce here transcriptions I have done, dictated by doctors who have examined, treated, and interviewed these unde(r)served citizens. I guarantee that even if you had NEVER to date had an episode of incontinence, you would PROMPTLY experience this condition upon hearing them. Shamefully, I have to change my pants several times a day (just kidding - but I&rsquo;m serious).</p>

<p>&#8220;As an older white male, I don&rsquo;t much like going to doctors either. Not because of the way they talk to me, but because of their attitude that the patient is required to do as they say, or you are a &ldquo;bad patient&rdquo;. Frankly, I just think they are too accustomed to acting like God.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problems with doctors and the whole system is that it is a profit driven business.  Forget the current politics and think about it a bit.  They want to sell you care and drugs, and surgeries.  There is an inherent conflict of interests in health care when the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis is profit driven.  </p>
<p>I just received a professional journal which reports that the Department of Health and Human Services has just released a report that says that&#8221;adverse medical events&#8221; are responsible nationwide for 20 deaths and hour, 493 deaths a day, and 180,000 deaths a year.  It said that 80,000 of those deaths at least are due to preventable errors such as letting infections develop, giving the patient the wrong medication or administering an excess dose of the right drug.  USA Today used the metaphor of the equivalent of a jumbo jet crashing every day.</p>

Greenwood man caught having sex with hogs </p>
<p></p>
<p>Mon Jan 24, 2011. </p>
<p>By Monica Land |</p>
<p>Gave hogs vaginal infection</p>
<p>GREENWOOD - Authorities said a man who was caught having sex with show hogs will have his case presented to the Leflore County Grand Jury next month. Andrew Lee Nash, 52, was arrested on Dec. 3, 2010 after police set up surveillance cameras in the owner&rsquo;s stalls near U.S. Highway 82 and the Yazoo River.</p>
<p>Greenwood Police Chief Henry Purnell said the hogs were examined by a local veterinarian, during a routine examination, and the owner was told that four of the hogs had a vaginal infection.</p>
<p>&#8220;The owner of the animals knew someone was messing with his animals,&#8221; said Chief Investigator Huntley Nevels. &#8220;And the veterinarian confirmed the sexual assault. So, the owner contacted police and the officers staked it out and caught him out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nash, who lives in the 700 block of Mississippi Avenue, was arrested at the scene and charged with 12 counts of unnatural intercourse.</p>
<p>Nash&rsquo;s bond was initially set at $600,000, but later reduced to $60,000.</p>
<p>Nash remains in custody at the Leflore County jail.</p>
<p>Greenwood authorities said Nash&rsquo;s case is scheduled to be presented before the Leflore County Grand Jury next month. If Nash is indicted and found guilty, he faces up to 120 years in jail.<br>
