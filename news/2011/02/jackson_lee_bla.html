			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pete Kasperowicz, The Hill, February 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) took to the House floor Tuesday night to criticize what she called a &#8220;demeaning&#8221; Pepsi ad that aired during the Super Bowl. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson Lee said it was ridiculous for the soft drink maker to air the advertisement during African-American history month.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this month of African-American history where we&rsquo;re trying to celebrate what is good and great, it certainly seems ridiculous that Pepsi would utilize this kind of humor,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was not humorous. It was demeaning  &mdash;  an African-American woman throwing something at an African-American male and winding up hitting a Caucasian woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson Lee said she has a sense of humor and believes in the First Amendment. She also said the Super Bowl is a great time for &#8220;fellowship&#8221; with family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why I&rsquo;m so disappointed with the Pepsi advertisement that showed a demeaning role for African American women, in an ad that showed a can being thrown and being utilized to wound someone else or hit someone else,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Rush had an interesting theory about this ad.  He thinks (and I have not yet been able to confirm) that black women are Pepsi&rsquo;s best customers, and they also tend not to like black men going with blonde white women.  Therefore, he thinks this ad was Pepsi doubly marketing to black women&rsquo;s &#8220;sensibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, I think Ms Jackson-Lee has the interpretation of this ad backwards.  It&rsquo;s racist, but against whites.</p>

		<p>This ad demonstrates just how effectively advertisers target their ads to the values of the audience. The audience for the super bowl is mainly white males. The ad shows an interracial white woman being whacked on the head with soda can by a jealous black women. Note that only a jealous black woman could morally inflict the injury. No white men were involved; black men were shown as non-aggressive. </p>
<p>Congressperson Jackson-Lee is right, for many the super bowl is a fun time, but for  advertisers it is a time to peddle their products. Appealing to their subconscious wishes is a great way to make them receptive to the product.</p>

		<p>If the couple were White and accidently injured somebody, they would have revived the person or called for help. They certainly would not walk away. Thus, the commercial would not be funny. A Black couple hurting someone and walking away is totally, completely believable. <br>
 <br>
Blacks complained they were not on TV enough. Now they complain when depicted in a believable (though negative) way. Since we are now stuck with Blacks in just about every commercial, some depictions should at least be realistic.</p>

		<p>Rush Limbaugh discussed this commercial, saying it revealed the rage black women have against white women who they perceive to be reducing black male availability.  He&rsquo;s right on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re led to believe it is only white males who are against such pairings, and nothing is EVER mentioned or written about the loathing black women feel toward a white woman who has a black partner. But the animosity is there and it is intense.</p>

		<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d agree with Lee, but I do on this one.  I saw that ad, and was astounded at the callous lack of taste in its presentation.  Not only did the black woman (accidentally) hit the white woman with the can of Pepsi, but the black woman and man ran sneakily off, obviously trying to avoid taking any responsibility for injuring the white woman.  This reflects reality, of course, but for people who are trying to improve the image of African Americans, this ad WAS in fact offensive.  Whoever the person was at Pepsi who approved that ad was a total idiot.  It made the blacks look really bad, and it angered whites.  Stupid move, Pepsi!</p>

		<p>This is exactly what I&rsquo;ve meant in previous posts of mine about media conditioning of our minds.  I believe it&rsquo;s actually a combination of more than one motif.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the feminist agenda.  We see a man playing the role of an un-assertive guy - in this case a Black guy being bullied  by his - whatever she is - wife, girlfriend, concubine, etc.  This motif is never depicted with the Black man in the role of the &#8220;fool&#8221; so-to-speak when the interaction is with a White guy.  In that case it is always the White guy being made to look like the buffoon.  But getting back to this commercial, I think we see a bit of the feminist agenda, the racial mixing agenda (When the White girl smiles at the Black guy, and also the &#8220;Beat up Whitey&#8221; agenda.  You&rsquo;ll notice that after the White girl gives the Black guy a smile, she gets hit with the can that was meant for him, and as the caption on the Amren homepage states, she&rsquo;s left unconscious on the ground.  The commercial is telling Black women to attack White women in effect.  So I believe there are 3 agenda&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>Feminist (Male emasculation)<br>
Promotion of Inter-racial sex<br>
Attacks on Whites</p>
<p>Does anyone here agree?</p>

<p>This is another classic example of the media subtly trying to shove miscegenation down our throats. There is nothing funny about it.</p>

		<p>I agree this commercial was obnoxious, not in the least funny.  But I take exception to this Sheila Jackson Lee taking up Congressional time complaining about it.  Taxpayers aren&rsquo;t paying your overly generous salary to critique commercials, although that is probably all she is qualified to do.  The government clown posse needs to be taking up the business of the nation and addressing the serious problems we are facing,  such as oil prices, unemployment and the soured economy, not worrying about what commercial aired during the super bowl.</p>

<p>I also saw a VERY LARGE greeting card company presented a TV ad where a black boy (14) give a very happy and excited white girl (12) a Valentines Day card. The message is becoming less and less subtle.</p>

		<p>I cannot but think that a great part of Pepsi&rsquo;s support for such an ad is due to its being run by an Indian woman who has made clear her dislike of Whites and historic White America; she also has said America is to blame for 9/11.  FWIW, I have not bought Pepsi products since that time.</p>

		<p>When I first saw the ad, I thought it was an attack on whites.  It portrayed the white woman as coming on to the black and getting attacked and left helpless on the ground.  However, after watching it again, I would tend to agree with Jackson-Lee.  The white woman is just giving the black guy a friendly smile and is rewarded with a Pepsi can to the side of the head.  Blacks are portrayed as savages who run off leaving a woman in pain on the sidewalk.  Regardless of how you look at it, it was a pretty thoughtless ad.</p>
<p>For all the people speculating about Pepsi&rsquo;s customer base - I heard several years ago that blacks consume about half of all soft drinks in the country.  This is why you see so many soft drink ads catering to them.  The concept of drinking juice or water or anything healthy is foreign to them.  The same is true of fast food.</p>

		<p>I think the ad will be effective with all groups, because it openly plays on themes that almost everyone at least subliminally recognizes but isn&rsquo;t permitted to talk about very openly. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t much matter what an individual&rsquo;s views, if any, are about the themes&hellip;just seeing them run through in a dramatic format provides a sort of psychic release of tension around them, as in an audience watching the performance of a Greek tragedy.</p>
<p>A clever ad, which I hated. And is Ms. Lee being paid by Pepsi? I feel a need for a Pepsi right now&hellip;I&rsquo;ll feel so &#8220;with it,&#8221; such an outrageous outlaw against decency, such a&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>In many ways, this was a tasteless ad. Congresswoman Lee is not upset that the white girl was beaned by a can full of Pepsi, but that the ad was so spot on about black women in general. THE TRUTH HURTS! </p>
<p>This ad is a microcosm of what happens when blacks and whites interact. Especially when white women pay any attention to black men. You can play this ad a million times to your white children to try to get them to understand what they are dealing with when it comes to most blacks. Especially if you are in a neighborhood with few to no minorities. </p>

		<p><i>The Pepsi advertisement that showed a demeaning role for African American women.</i></p>
<p>I doubt Jackson Lee understood anything more than that.</p>
<p>The reflection of reality is that Jackson Lee is dumb as a box of rocks,  not only believing Neil Armstrong planted a flag on Mars, but that North and South Vietnam  &#8220;forged a peaceful relationship with one another in the years since the Vietnam War and live side-by-side, exchanging and working.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing we can be sure of, though:  Jackson-Lee is White-hating racist, and, from the following, I&rsquo;d say she hates her own people as well (but is too dumb to realize it):</p>
<p>During her congressional career, Jackson Lee voted against:</p>
<p>The Real ID Act</p>
<p>The construction of 700 miles of fencing to prevent illegal immigration along America&rsquo;s southern border;</p>
<p>A proposal to grant state and local officials the authority to investigate, identify, and arrest illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>Rush also said that since he is conservative he doesn&rsquo;t see color.  This of course explains why all of his wives have been white.  </p>
<p>I was offended by the ad also but not like the &#8220;congresswoman&#8221; was.  </p>
<p>The skit offered us a sexy white woman &#8220;eyeballing&#8221; and smiling at a black male.  The subtlety is of course that pretty white girls are naturally drawn to blank men, even old ugly fat ones like in the ad.  </p>
<p>The message to white girls is obvious, &#8220;even a worn-out old black is preferable as a mate than an up and coming white man.&#8221;  And, black men are so desirable they can&rsquo;t even go to the park without getting hit on by white women.   </p>
<p>The <b>Hallmark Card</b> scam industry is doing the same.  One of their ads shows a pretty white girl excitedly receiving a valentine card from a very black and very young black male.  </p>
<p>The other message of the Pepsi poison drink ad, as was mentioned by others, is that blacks can assault whites with no consequences as was shown. But, this only reflects what is happening in the real world anyway. </p>
<p>Yes I watched the super-bowl, but only because GB appears to be the whitest team.  Many of their stars are also white. I look at it this way, every time a white play gains and maintains a starting position on an NFL team, he is destroying black athletic superiority myth. </p>
<p>I myself am making preparations to head to the Northwest, somewhere in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, or Western Montana.   </p>

<p>* The angry black woman<br>
* The black man&rsquo;s lust for white women<br>
* Black people fleeing from a crime and/or responsibility <br>

		<p>Recently, and I&rsquo;m talking in the last six months, I&rsquo;ve been seeing the black male/white female pairing thing promoted EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>I was at Macy&rsquo;s and for their valentine&rsquo;s day sale they had a huge poster of a blond woman and black man kissing.  </p>
<p>Then I was in the bookstore, and there was a graphic novel whose whole theme was of a white girl trying to get the preppie, black basketball star in her school to notice her.  She got him in the end.  And so many other examples.  </p>
<p>It seems to me there is some sort of a spontaneous push going on to make this a permanent reality.  I see that type of couple in real life all the time, also.  My question is, why do black men only go for blond white women and not black haired white women?</p>

		<p>This ad was quite offensive to me.  It made black on white violence seem trivial.  By far the worst commercial on the air today is the Hallmark commercial where the teen girl sitting on a bench is met by a black boy giving her a Hallmark card.  It&rsquo;s an attack on our civilization by a company who has made a fortune on it.  I will never buy another Hallmark card.</p>

<p>I agree. I believe there is a emasculation of men. I don&rsquo;t know however if I can attribute it to media (or at least all). Like white guilt, there is male guilt. </p>
<p>A diluted history depicting women as victims and men as oppressors. Which is a VERY biased form of history by the way.</p>
<p>Having women shelters, and other social programs that help one particular gender with double standard bogus.</p>
<p>Claiming men and women are equal, yet want privilege of merit in cases that suit women.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar?</p>

<p>I swear I will NEVER spend another penny with this company. &#8220;</p>
<p><br>
- That&rsquo;s a good start. Please be aware, though, that Pepsi is a large conglomerate company producing everything from Quaker oats to Tropicana. Check out their website for a listing. It does no good, for example, to stop buying Pepsi and buy Mt Dew instead when both are made by the same company.</p>

		<p>Art imitates reality&hellip;Anyone remember how a while back at the corner of Florence &amp; Normandy, an innocent white guy was hit in the head by a black thug using a brick instead of a can?  That wasn&rsquo;t funny, either. Whatever possessed the no-talent schmucks on Madison Ave to try this angle to market soda? My family is boycotting all of Pepsi&rsquo;s products.</p>

		<p>Why is everyone sorry for this white girl in the ad? I am a white girl, and this particular one is not my equal if she sits down with that kind of company and flirts with black men. The end of the ad is realistic, as both blacks run off with each other and avoid what they have just done. The black man is most likely still interested in white women, but would not help one that is knocked out right next to him. Humorless ad, yes, but there is a lot to learn from it.</p>

&#8220;I agree this commercial was obnoxious, not in the least funny. But I take exception to this Sheila Jackson Lee taking up Congressional time complaining about it. Taxpayers aren&rsquo;t paying your overly generous salary to critique commercials, although that is probably all she is qualified to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously you don&rsquo;t know much about Sheila Jackson.  She also wastes time complaining about the lack of black names for hurricanes. </p>

		<p>I think that a lot of the problem is that we are talking about two distinctly different cultures, with very different ideas of what is funny. </p>
<p>When I taught 6th grade, I asked the students to write a composition on something funny that happened at school. Just about all the black students wrote about someone &#8220;bangin&#8221; someone else, someone getting pushed into a locker door and getting a gash in the leg from it, someone getting hurt in a fight, etc. When I reminded them that the composition was supposed to be about something funny, they told me that it was funny. Cultural differences.</p>

		<p>The Hallmark ad is particularly disgusting as it involves a 13-14 year old girl looking longingly at her black boyfriend.  Young girls that age (I have had 2) deal with enough issues without thinking that interracial relationships at that age are &#8220;the norm.&#8221;  I left a complaint on the Hallmark website expressing my disgust.  Whatever company handles their advertising has done them a terrible disservice. What &#8220;audience&#8221; did they think they were reaching with this &#8220;in your face&#8221; social engineering B.S.?!</p>
