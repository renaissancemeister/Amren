			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerri Peev, Daily Mail (London), February 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Schools have been told they have to make special allowances for misbehaving pupils from gypsy and traveller families</p>
<p>Teachers have been warned they could be taken to task under the Equality Act if they discipline or exclude such children from schools.</p>
<p>Cash-strapped schools are even told they should launch an &#8216;outreach&rsquo; programme with a dedicated member of staff to &#8216;build trust&rsquo; with traveller families.</p>
<p>Under Equality and Human Rights Commission guidance, teachers are told to be sympathetic to traveller parents because they struggle with &#8216;confidence&rsquo; issues and are put off attending school meetings to discuss their children&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>A guidance note said: &#8216;In cases where parents co-operate with the headteacher and are shown to be committed to assisting the pupil to manage their behaviour, it is less likely that the pupil will face exclusion.</p>
<p>&#8216;This procedure may indirectly discriminate against the gypsy and traveller pupil whose parents may be less likely to come to the school to speak with the headteacher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tory MP Priti Patel criticised the special treatment. She said: &#8216;I have concerns with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission dictating to headteachers how to run their schools and burdening them with more bureaucracy. </p>
<p> &#8216;There are times when schools do need to exclude pupils to protect the rights of others to learn and headteachers should not be put off making these decisions by the patronising diktats of the Equality and Human Rights Commission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;The Commission&rsquo;s recommendation on travellers only serves to reinforce stereotypes as well as showing that political correctness and the human rights agenda are being skewered further against common sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Katharine Birbalsingh  &mdash;  who was fired as a deputy head after laying bare problems in the state school system  &mdash;  said: &#8216;The idea that certain groups should be protected from exclusion is nonsense.</p>
<p>&#8216;How insulting is this guidance for gypsy and traveller children? It basically suggests that they will go on to be problem pupils.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Commission said the advice protected all children from discrimination. She added: &#8216;The requirements in Equality Act 2010 for schools to treat all pupils fairly are consistent with other legal obligations relating to exclusions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Commission is consulting education and legal experts on its guidance.</p>
<p>Miss Birbalsingh is setting up her own free school, it has emerged. A surprise star of last year&rsquo;s Conservative Party conference after delivering a damning indictment of &#8216;utterly chaotic&rsquo; state schools, the 37-year-old says the backlash from her speech has made her unemployable in comprehensive schools. She is in preliminary talks to open a free school in a deprived area, possibly Brent in North London or Lambeth in South London. Pupils would study a highly academic curriculum and face strict discipline.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gone to school with both Gypsies &amp; Blacks and I can tell you there is NO DIFFERENCE in every-day behavior. Both live in ghettos, are slow-witted, lazy, quick to steal &amp; lie. In Romania, Gypsies were enslaved like Blacks in the West.</p>

		<p>Most of the gypsy kids don&rsquo;t even go to school in the first place, so I would think the number of disruptive gypsy kids is very small to begin with. But it only takes a few and the entire school can be made a shambles fast.</p>
<p>And as most gypsy kids are married by the age of fourteen, these have to be grammar school kids and young?</p>

<p>Please note the only &#8220;British&#8221; politicians willing to publicly condemn this special treatment for certain minorities, are females named Patel and Birbalsingh. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Scandinavia and I don&rsquo;t know how a country like Romania can tolerate as much 4% of the population being gypsies. Where I live, they are not even close to 0,5% and yet I&rsquo;ve heard that they commit 10% of the homicides. In other words, they can make blacks look good! </p>
<p>Even the gypsy children carry knives and guns are not rare among adults, and they are very quick to use them on whites if they feel irritated. The only consolidation is that when they do, they often attack one of their own relating to a concept of a &#8216;blood revenge&rsquo;. Their practices are a mishmash of hinduism, maybe some twisted christianity and just plain sociopathic thuggery with a complete disregard for the society which keeps them alive. </p>
<p>When in school, they disrupt and abuse other kids and teachers are squeamish about making them follow rules, like not carrying knives. They are complete academic failures of course and often do not learn to read. They go on pension once they hit 18 and may try to lift disability pension/benefit from more than one country at a time. While the benefit is enough to live on, they persist in stealing everything they can carry. </p>
<p>Somewhat luckily, they seem to mostly stick to their own race in mating and thus do not harass white women that often like blacks and associated non-whites. They are highly inbred, carrying specific diseases and incest is allegedly no stranger to them. They have managed to gain white genes from the few whites willing to breed with them, but the continuing inbreeding may be expected to weaken them towards increased helplesness and lesser dangerousness. </p>

<p>What sort of equality is this? It looks like &#8216;equality&rsquo;, along with &#8216;racism&rsquo; is now a word / term with no meaning at all, unless it is weilded by a bureaucrat, thus making it subject to frequent change to suit agendas.</p>

<p>Genetic testing gives away their origins as central Asia, close to northern India.  </p>
<p>The name Gypsy is a slang for Egyptian, which somehow stuck to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought gypsies were white what gives? are the semitic or arab?&#8221;</p>
<p>I lived in Eastern Europe and traveled in about 16 European countries, including the British Isles (Ireland included).  Here is what I know about Gypsies;</p>
<p>The original ones were from India. They were a nomadic group that got driven out as tribes consolidated regional territories.  They continued their  way Westward over a long period of time, settling in cities and living by whatever means they could find.  That included stealing, prostitution, developing services like fortune telling after the Pope banned the Tarot cards following the suppression of the Knights Templar.  (Templars used picture cards to teach their recruits their philosophy and mysticism. Picture cards were common teaching devices in the Middle East and later Europe among illiterate populations.  Since the Pope pronounced their use a heresy, certain populations found them intriguing and they grew into an occult form of mysticism).  Also, Gypsies were known to abduct children and sell them elsewhere as slaves.  Traveling light and keeping moving from one territory to another, sometimes finding space and sympathy kept their community alive.  Over time abducted children retained in the tribe or local cast off populations were adopted into Gypsy clans and brought some local customs to a particular group.  So Spanish Gypsies are different from the kind found in Southeastern Europe, and the type found in Ireland are really completely different from the others and really represent the several generation of homeless Irish who survived the potato famine but became landless.  They were tolerated since they were indigenous and Catholic, and usually provided some service or entertainment, such as kitchen ware repair or even knife sharpening.  But they served as a developer and repository of Irish folk music as well and made &#8220;Busking,&#8221; playing on the street for money an accepted and even charming cultural feature, even though Tinkers were also capable of gambling scams like &#8220;Three Card Monty&#8221; and such.  They weren&rsquo;t limited to Ireland either.  The Tinker life style was present everywhere in the British Isles.  Modern social and public organization has put that culture into a sort of squeeze.  Some of them have learned to work the system it is true.  Personally I would rather have an Irish Tinker on welfare than anyone from abroad.  That is because they are indigenous and are merely historical losers, but as we have seen, repositories of poetry and music of those cultures, just the way American &#8220;hillbillies&#8221; are looked down on, but have been the repositories of our American heritage in a very important way.</p>
<p>Today, the term Gypsy has been used so loosely that almost any Eastern European immigrant is looked at as a Gypsy if they are poor and desperate.  There is a difference.  Eastern Europe lived under a repressive totalitarian regime as we know.  Before that, they lived under a totalitarian monarchy of either Russia, (Romanoff) or Austrian (Hapsburg), as well as others such as the Ottoman Turks in the Balkans.  The cultures that generated were used to the necessity of for example, a black market simply to survive.  To Westerners black market activity seems like Gypsy activity, but not all the mafias (traditional national gangs that operate the black markets) are Gypsy and they would be insulted if termed so.  The nations in today&rsquo;s Balkans have problems with Gypsies too, but they are trying to deal with them humanely.  I remember that Portugal had built out door facilities just for Gypsies here and there, and it seemed to work, while France provided nothing and Gypsies would raid commercial campgrounds at night for water, toilet use, etc.</p>
<p>I am sure there is more to it and many perspectives since the history of Gypsies in Europe is by now nearing a thousand years.  Perhaps some others will post more on their particular knowledge and add to or correct some of mine.</p>

<p>That is WHY blacks and gypsies were enslaved. Their genetics and DNA make them unbearable to live among Whites. Too bad most Whites don&rsquo;t see the why&rsquo;s of having enslavement when they are in one of our countries. It is the only way.</p>
<p>They are leeches and prey upon their hosts in every White nation they reside in. Shouldn&rsquo;t that alone wake up most Whites? Apparently it does not. Brainwashing and political correctness has worked wonders on White people the world over, it seems.</p>

		<p>In Baltimore, our happy band of gypsies mostly use the last name Stevens or Stephens. I once had the pleasure of seeing a gypsy wedding first-hand  &mdash;  the bride indeed was extremely young, talked about nothing other than the clothes she would get to have now that she was marrying, did three or four costume changes during the wedding festivities. The wedding couple left with a cigar box full of hundred dollar bills, but stiffed the caterer and staff. It was creepy.</p>

<p>Of course not. The gypsies (Romani gypsies, originating from India as you said) are a race/ethnicity and one cannot become a gypsy. One is born gypsy just like one is born white. You can readily tell by their brownish features (and, depending on region, their clothing) who they are.</p>
<p>So basically, the gypsies are very low IQ Indians with white and Asian admixture. They don&rsquo;t have what it takes to operate any kind of mafia, and I&rsquo;m not surprised if more sophisticated criminals would take offense at being compared to gypsies. In addition, there are only a few million of them alive, spread out over Europe and a few in the States.</p>
<p>You seem to have some sort of a weird, romantic view of gypsies, possibly bolstered by movies. Since you&rsquo;re not European, I don&rsquo;t blame you. </p>
