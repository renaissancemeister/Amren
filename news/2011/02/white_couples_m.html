			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Hough, Telegraph (London), February 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ministers want new adoption guidance to allow families who meet existing criteria for a child to be able to adopt regardless of their race.</p>
<p>Under new guidance to be issued next week, councils will be told that preventing families from adopting children of a different ethnic group &#8220;is not child-centred and is unacceptable&#8221;.</p>
<p>The new guidance will state if a family has met the &#8220;emotional and developmental needs&#8221; of a child officials are to ignore their ethnic origin.</p>
<p>The guidance does not change the law but will make clear that race should not be a &#8220;deal-breaker&#8221; if the prospective adopters show that they are able to parent the child.</p>
<p>Current advice states that social workers must give &#8220;due consideration to the child&rsquo;s religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the government believes these rules are not being interpreted properly by social workers, who are using race as their deciding factor.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;strengthened&#8221; guidance also makes clear that single prospective parents should not be discriminated against.</p>
<p>It also warns social services against delaying placing a child with a suitable family of a different ethnicity.</p>
<p>Figures show that ethnic minority children can wait, on average, up to three times longer than white children to be placed with an adoptive family. In extreme cases some are not adopted at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time is not on the side of the child and a delay in placing a child with a new family can damage their development, contribute to further emotional harm, reduce their chances of finding a permanent family or increase the chance of adoption breakdown,&#8221; the guidance will say.</p>
<p>&#8220;The social worker must not delay placing a child with a prospective adopter because the prospective adopter is single, older or does not share the child&rsquo;s racial or cultural background.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of placing obstacles in the way of families seeking to adopt a child of different ethnicity, they should be properly trained to cater for its cultural needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It found that in some examples the chances of being adopted reduced by &#8220;nearly a half for every year of delay&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Education Department last night confirmed reports that the guidance would be published on Tuesday by Michael Gove, the Schools Secretary, who was adopted.</p>
<p>Each local authority and adoption agency will be &#8220;closely monitored and those that break the new rules will be &#8220;named and shamed&#8221;, it was reported.</p>
<p>In January Martin Narey, the outgoing chief executive of Barnardo&rsquo;s, said Britain was facing a dangerous collapse in adoption rates.</p>
<p>She cited the prejudiced attitudes of some local authorities and adoption agencies towards white parents adopting minority ethnic children as one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Only 70 babies were adopted last year compared with 4,000 in 1976.</p>
<p>Mr Narey blamed the reluctance of agencies to allow white couples to adopt black children as one of the major reasons for the decline, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;The law is very clear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A child should not stay in care for an undue length of time while waiting for adoptive parents of the same ethnicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the reality is that black, Asian and mixed-race children wait three times longer than white children.&#8221;</p>
<p>A recent survey disclosed widespread poor practice among adoption agencies. The Adoption UK research found that prospective parents are frequently unfairly rejected or forced to endure waits of up to six months after their initial inquiry, three times longer than legislation demands.</p>
<p>An Education Department spokeswoman said last night that the current guidance was to be &#8220;strengthened&#8221; to reflect current attitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been clear that ethnicity should not be a &#8216;deal breaker&rsquo; for parents to be able to adopt and should not hinder them in this,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If parents meet the needs of a child they should not be prevented giving them a loving home.&#8221;<br>

		<p> And what if &#8220;not enough&#8221; White parents want to adopt non-White orphans? Will the next step be to set a quota for each year&rsquo;s number of adoptions, and force some Whites to adopt outside their race, whether they want to or not?</p>
<p> It seems to me that, rather than blaming so-called &#8220;prejudice&#8221; of local authorities, and pretending that there are thousands of White parents lined up and slathering at the mouth to adopt non-White children, the government should be asking why prospective parents of these children&rsquo;s races or ethnic groups, who are plentiful in Britain now, are not coming forward to adopt in sufficient numbers?</p>
<p> But of course, that might imply that someone is at fault here besides Poor Old Whitey, and we couldn&rsquo;t have that, now could we?</p>

		<p>White parents will now be &#8220;allowed&#8221; (read: required) to adopt non-White children.</p>
<p>This will clear the crack babies out of the orphanages and make everything look wonderful on paper. It might even promote the illusion that ethnic minorities are adopting the unwanted children of their own races.</p>

		<p>I always thought England would wake up and turn things around.  I thought France would be the first to fall, but now it looks like England is going down first.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, they will both have civil wars, but have you read the articles coming out of London just on this day alone on Amren? </p>
<p>Hopefully IF England has a civil war the majority of white refugees will be accepted here and they will help us mold our politics before we blindly follow suit.  At least that would be a best situation out of a worst case scenario.  But seriously, ban whites from adopting nonwhites, no big deal.  It&rsquo;ll force whites to choose whites if they want to adopt.  A white kid being adopted by a liberal has a better chance of surviving than one growing up an orphan, look at the statistics.</p>

		<p>I imagine there are many black babies to adopt, since mommy wanted to suck the teat of welfare as long as humanly possible. This is a sad thing to say, but one way to derail this activity is to donate more time/ money to the local Clinic.<br>
Ignorant whites think its chique to have blacks, asians and as many other multi-colored kids as possible - case in point - NWO shills Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.<br>
In their ignorance, they probably think this makers them appear more cultured. Very pathetic.</p>

		<p>Who do they think they&rsquo;re fooling? This isn&rsquo;t due to officials preventing interracial adoptions. Most people simply prefer to adopt a child of their own background. No doubt the next step is for the government to forbid prospective parents from stating a preference. That&rsquo;s really what this is gearing up for.</p>

		<p>The real problem is that far too many &#8220;Whites&#8221; adopt any sort of nonwhite children today. They love to pat themselves on the back and show themselves as more &#8220;tolerant&#8221; and &#8220;loving&#8221; than the rest of us, when in reality they are nothing but useful idiots and traitors to their own race.  Propaganda works, folks! </p>
<p> Remember Haiti and all those &#8220;Whites&#8221; going to rescue the &#8220;children&#8221; and adopting them? Look at the &#8220;stars&#8221; in Hollyweird and the never ending propaganda of the &#8220;joys&#8221; of interracial adoptions and co-habitations. </p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good idea to allow white people to adopt ethnic children because Left wing white people may not adopt white kids and poison their minds.Instead they may adopt ethnic kids and cause less harm.</p>

		<p>But ONLY those White couples stupid enough to WANT to adopt non-White children! To which I would have to say, &#8220;Thanks but No Thanks!&#8221; For instance, when our last one left the nest for college and then a career and marriage, we flirted with the idea of opening our home to foster children. We certainly have the room. We looked. We saw. We DECLINED! The good people at the ageny were miffed but we told them flatly we were simply uninterested in fostering (and possibly adopting) anything other than our own kind   &mdash;   healthy WHITE children!</p>

		<p>A lady from our church posted on Facebook that her friend wanted prayers because they had to leave &#8220;their&#8221; adopted daughter in Africa.  Something happened in the legal system where this couple couldn&rsquo;t take home their new baby.  I wanted so bad to comment why in the world would this couple desire to adopt a black child &amp; if so, adopt one from the US.  <br>
I was given a guilt trip from an adoption agency several years ago that I needed to think outside the box &amp; realize that other races need homes too.  My reply was I agreed that these non-white babies/toddlers needed homes but with their own kind.  I am White &amp; I want a white baby.  I shouldn&rsquo;t have to feel guilty for wanting to adopt a baby that looks like me!<br>
Thankfully we were finally able to have our own baby!</p>

		<p>My lifelong friends are/were of this mindset; Their 3 beautiful white bio kids are all grown and on their own, and they took a notion to adopt/foster a string of black foster children, sadly the victims of drugs, alcohol and/or violence. </p>
<p>Now that these adopted children are theirs to keep and well into their teens, the violence towards the white parents is daunting. The mother is facing felony abuse charges when the adopted daughter attacked her. The adopted son is 13, over six foot and 240 lbs and intimidating them all. </p>
<p>She said to me recently. &#8220;we were almost done with kids and now all this&#8221;&hellip;.. sadly this is misery of their own making. </p>
<p>It may well haunt me, but I could never adopt such children. <br>

		<p>I know a white couple who adopted two children, one from India and one from Nigeria- both had equally dark sin and brought up in the same family in a wealthy neighborhood. Since the area they lived in was 99 percent white with no regular interaction with Asian Indians or blacks both children were labeled as &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the India child grew up to get a full scholarship to Harvard to major in biology and math(non affirmative action as Indian are considered Asian and held to higher standards than whites) and the Nigeria child is currently in prison.</p>

		<p>But don&rsquo;t you see that interracial adoption was banned by our politically-correct elites precisely because they didn&rsquo;t want non-white children to be culturally integrated into British society?</p>
<p>I can only suppose that said elites&rsquo; recent change of heart (indeed, complete volte-face) has come about because their primary objective - of splitting once-homogeneous Britain into a multiplicity of mutually hostile ghettoes confronting a silenced rump of sullen or smug indigenous people - has already been irreversibly achieved.</p>
