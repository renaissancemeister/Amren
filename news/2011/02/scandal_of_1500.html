			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Louise Sassoon, Daily Express (London), February 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MORE than 150,000 illegal immigrants are said to be claiming benefits despite not having any rights to live in Britain, it was claimed last night.</p>
<p>Government ministers have found that Labour allowed tens of thousands of people to wrongly qualify for sickness benefits and maternity pay  &mdash;  costing the tax-payer &#8220;tens of millions of pounds&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is thought most of the 155,000 abusers of the system did so by outstaying their working visas or managing to find employment without having any work permit.</p>
<p>At present someone could be working illegally in the UK and be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance and statutory payments such as maternity or paternity pay and sick pay, a source claimed.</p>
<p>This is because the Department for Work and Pensions has not asked to see work permits when assessing claims and employers have not been asked to prove those claiming benefits are working in Britain legally. </p>
<p>The Whitehall source added: &#8220;It cannot be right that people who aren&rsquo;t eligible to work here can get benefits that are a substitute for earnings.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a classic example of where the welfare system has been allowed to get completely out of control. It is difficult to track because these are illegal workers, but the cost is likely to be in the tens of millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Government plans to crack down on the issue with the Welfare Reform Bill, expected to be introduced into Parliament shortly, which will ensure access to any of the benefits includes an entitlement to work here.</p>
<p>Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: &#8220;We know that family is the most important influence on a child&rsquo;s life, so it is no surprise that with this many children growing up with parents on unemployment benefits we are facing inter generational worklessness and benefit dependency on such a massive scale.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This sounds very much like the situation with Obama&rsquo;s aunt in Massachusetts. As many of you know, Aunt Zeituni is living in public housing and receiving a Federal disability check</p>
<p>How did an Illegal Immigrant get a slot in Public Housing? And to top it off, receiving Federal assistance money, too.</p>
<p>I can only surmise that there is a network of people working in these social services agencies that are being bought off in some way.</p>
<p>Just like with the drivers licenses being issued to Illegal Immigrants. It always seems to be an inside job with DMV workers being paid off to dispense with the goodies.</p>
<p>But the Talk Radio shills like Rush, Hannity, and Levin will never bring it up in any way. Those fools will make an issue of Obama ordering a burger with spicy mustard on it, but not a word about Aunt Zeituni.</p>

		<p>The concern is framed around the welfare of the children, rather than the swift deportation of the entire family.  </p>

		<p>Well, DUHH - hey, Brits, why do you think they immigrated to your lovely little socialist country in the first place????  It wasn&rsquo;t to learn how to properly show up for tea, trust me&hellip;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Illegals have cost UK taxpayers &ldquo;tens of millions of pounds.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another example of why multiculturalism is going to cause financial collapse and an explosion into violence.</p>
<p>True justice would be served if, after the ashes quit smoldering, Brits went looking for the white elitists who are responsible for the destruction of their country.<br>

		<p>150,000?  That&rsquo;s it?  Lol, I wish we (the U.S.) only had that many.  All joking aside, we both lose.  </p>
<p>How can they not ask for a simple document when people are applying for this?  Its like cops not asking for your I.D. when you get pulled over in a car.  It boggle the mind, it really does.  Since Labor wanted these immigrants in (to spite, for the record) I&rsquo;m sure they told all the cronies below them not to check.  Like what we have with the New Black Panther Party (lack of) investigation.  How Authoritarian.  Someone breaks the law and the guy with the bigger desk says to just ignore it and you do.  How much can we be like 1984?  Please let some sort of revolution by the people come before this beautiful country is no longer worth saving (and I am not implying violence).</p>

		<p>Scandal?  Why, I see no scandal.  This is just &#8220;compassion&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and &#8220;inclusiveness&#8221; and &#8220;welcoming the stranger.&#8221;  </p>
