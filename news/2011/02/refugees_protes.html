<h1>Refugees Protest, Seek Protection</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christopher Burbach, Omaha World-Herald, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Refugees from war-torn Somalia and their families packed a South Omaha public housing office Tuesday morning to plead for protection after a recent series of assaults and incidents.</p>
<p>The two-hour protest by more than 100 people at the office of South Side Terrace drew Omaha Housing Authority officials, a police officer and eventually City Councilman Ben Gray of the OHA board.</p>
<p>Mohamed Hassan, director of the Somali Bantu Association of Nebraska, urged the people to protest because they were frustrated with what they said was a slow response from authorities.</p>
<p>Hassan said they were beginning to talk about retaliating against their assailants, young men who live at South Side.</p>
<p>&#8220;(The refugees) come from work, they are beaten,&#8221; Hassan said. &#8220;They came from school, they are beaten. There is no safety and security. We came here for peace. We did not come here to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and witnesses said people have seen the attackers run out of a South Side apartment and beat people, then run back in. They said they&rsquo;ve told police, but officers haven&rsquo;t followed up.</p>

						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The distribution of both African Americans and Hispanics in Omaha can be attributed to several factors. For African Americans, &#8220;white flight&#8221; out of north Omaha and the availability of lower-cost housing of old sectors of the city have concentrated the population in the northeast of the city. </p>
<p>The location of the Hispanic center is strongly influenced by the concentration of the population in south Omaha. South Omaha has always been an area for immigrants, initially beginning with Italians, Germans, Czechs, Irish, Poles and other Eastern Europeans, then switching to Hispanics in more recent times. The reason for south Omaha being an &#8220;immigrant area&#8221; is largely due to the historically numerous slaughterhouse operations located there that attract immigrant labor and, consequently, immigrant settlement. <br>

		<p> Did we just witness subtle, racial &#8220;slanting&#8221; of a report in the Omaha World-Herald? Anyone can determine by looking at a world map that Somalis are from Africa and are, therefore, probably black. The World-Herald underlines this by publishing a photo of the poor, put-upon protesters (who are not just from Somalia, but &#8220;war-torn&#8221; Somalia   &mdash;   sob, sob!) But when it comes to identifying their attackers, they are merely &#8220;young men&#8221; who live at South Side Terrace.</p>
<p> Young Irishmen, perhaps? They&rsquo;re always pugnacious, aren&rsquo;t they? How about young German men? The Nazis were German, weren&rsquo;t they? And we know how horrible THEY were!</p>
<p> No, folks, methinks the World-Herald is trying to hide the fact that the black Somalis are being attacked by   &mdash;   black Americans! Unless the reporter is just assuming that anyone from Omaha will know that South Side Terrace is a black &#8220;project&#8221; anyway. I think we&rsquo;re all learned that when the media is at great pains not to identify the race of a particular perp or perps   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re black. YOu can take that to the bank.</p>

		<p>It is well known that African-Americans prey on Somali immigrants.</p>
<p>It is also well known that African-Americans cannot get along with anyone.  Over the last 50 years in L.A., CA, a succession of people have tried to run small corner grocery stores in the Black areas of town.  First Whites &amp; Jews, then Arabs and Lebanese, then Chinese, Indian, Korean, Pakistani, and recently, Iranians, Palestinians, Iraqis and Kurds    &mdash;   each in turn robbed, assaulted, burnt out and driven out.  There is not a race in the world that can live with Africans.</p>
<p>And of course, it is never, never the African&rsquo;s fault.  The problems are always due to racism.  Then, the Africans complain that there are no stores in their communities   &mdash;   Ha, Ha!</p>

		<p>Thats funny I thought that NAACP views all blacks as a monolithic group based purely on color. Seems the typical American black does not get along with the newly arrived African blacks.</p>

		<p>These are the relatives of the same people who dragged the bodies of U.S. soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu in 1993.  </p>
<p>These are the relatives of the same warlords and pirates operating today against U.S. shipping. </p>
<p>These are the same people who have established a reputation across the Western world for fraud and violent criminality against their hosts.</p>
<p>These are the relatives of the anti-Western jihadists linked to Al-Quaeda.</p>
<p>Who decided to let them in, and how should they be punished? </p>

		<p>It was Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s idea to let them in. They started flying thousands of them into USA and just dropping them in towns. The plan is to destabilize the USA and weaken her by turning her into a 3rd world country.</p>

<p>In France the term &#8216;Youths&rsquo; is used to denote young violence prone Muslims.  </p>
<p>It appears as though &#8216;Youths&rsquo; has become some sort of Progressive euphemism for Colored People.  </p>

		<p>The Somalis were dumped into Nebraska as part of the refugee plan. (&#8220;Diversity is Our Stength.&#8221;)   The Somalis received free medical and restorative dental care, which were services denied to the Nebraskans who paid the bill.  The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/world/americas/16iht-letter.1.17008659.html" rel="nofollow"> reported on the problems caused when the Somalis at a Grand Island, Nebraska meatpacking plant demanded and received time off for prayers</a>.  The plant shut for 15 minutes, so everyone lost 15 minutes wages.  As that article reported, &#8220;In some of these places, including Grand Island, this newest wave of immigrant workers [i.e., the Somalis] has had the effect of unifying the other ethnic populations against the Somalis&hellip;..&#8221;   As Raul García said, &#8220;They act like the United States owes them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides, from the name of the organization it seems like these people are Bantu Somalis. According to Wikipedia the Bantu Somalis</p>
<p>&ldquo;are the descendants of people from various Bantu ethnic groups originating from what are modern-day Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique who were sold into Somalia as part of the Arab slave trade in the 19th century. Bantus are ethnically, physically, and culturally distinct from Somalis, and have remained marginalized ever since their arrival in Somalia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the Somali Civil War, many Bantu were forced from their lands in the lower Juba River valley, as militiamen from various Somali clans took control of the area. Being visible minorities and possessing little in the way of firearms, the Bantu were particularly vulnerable to violence and looting by gun-toting militiamen&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prior to the United States&rsquo; agreement to accommodate Bantu refugees from Somalia, attempts were made to resettle the refugees to their ancestral homes in southeastern Africa. Before the prospect of emigrating to America was raised, this was actually the preference of the Bantus themselves. In fact, many Bantus voluntarily left the UN camps where they were staying, to seek refuge in Tanzania. Such a return to their ancestral homeland represented the fulfillment of a two-century old dream.&rdquo; </p>
