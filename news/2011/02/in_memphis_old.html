<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110221/US.Memphis.Schools.Race/">In Memphis, Old Strife Heats Up Over Schools, Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adrian Sainz, Comcast News, February 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On March 8, Memphis voters will decide whether to approve disbanding the city schools system and turning education over to the county district, which is earning good grades on its own and doing everything it can to stave off consolidation.</p>
<p>Memphis resident and school cafeteria worker Mary Washington questioned why Memphis schools would even want to give over its students to a system that doesn&rsquo;t want them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just like you losing your freedom going into bondage,&#8221; Washington, who is black, said after an American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees meeting. &#8220;In the background, in the foreground, it is about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Pickler, the white Shelby County School Board chairman, bristles at such claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that we don&rsquo;t want someone because of the color of their skin to me is the most offensive thing someone can say to me,&#8221; Pickler said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a growing feeling among some parents and students that the children are being ignored as adults make power plays and political moves.</p>
<p>The Memphis City Schools board voted last December to surrender its charter and turn over control to Shelby County&rsquo;s system, which includes public schools outside the city limits.</p>
<p>The spark for the schools consolidation fight began smoldering on Election Day last November, when Republicans took control of the state Legislature and saw Republican Bill Haslam win the governor&rsquo;s race. Shelby County&rsquo;s Republican politicians finally saw their chance to forever block a merger by securing special school district status.</p>
<p>The special status would draw a boundary around the Shelby County school district, protecting its autonomy and tax base  &mdash;  and, according to Jones, taking $100 million a year from the already underfunded Memphis schools system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Memphis schools began integrating in 1961 without the violence other Southern cities endured. White parents instead left the city for the suburbs or put their children in private schools, effectively re-segregating education into a mostly black city system and a largely white suburban system.</p>
<p>The 2010-2011 budget for Memphis City Schools is about $890 million to cover 103,000 students, 85 percent of whom are black. For the 47,000-student Shelby County system, which is 38 percent black, it&rsquo;s more than $363 million.</p>
<p>Nicole Scott, 37, lives in the upscale suburb of Germantown and has three children in the Shelby County schools. Scott, who is white, says fears a merger will diminish quality in the public schools her children now attend and suggests the white flight that desegregation created will happen again.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Memphis City Council accepted the charter surrender Feb. 10, dissolving the board.</p>
<p>State and federal governments quickly entered the fight. Within days, Republican lawmakers passed and the governor enacted a law that delays the merger for three years.</p>
<p>Pickler, who has asked a federal judge to invalidate the Memphis school board&rsquo;s decision to disband, says it&rsquo;s unfair that county voters will not be allowed to vote March 8. He says absorbing the Memphis system, which earned D&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s from the state in important categories last year, would hurt academics in the county system, which received all A&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Pickler also argues the creation of one huge district will overstretch resources, possibly leading to job cuts among nontenured teachers, janitors and cafeteria workers. Schools that are operating under capacity could be closed.</p>
<p>City council chairman Myron Lowery, a prominent African-American official, invoked the language of segregation in describing what he thinks opponents of the merger want: &#8220;Separate but equal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reason the suburban district is &#8220;earning good grades&#8221; is found later in this article   &mdash;   Its student body is a relatively paltry by comparison 38% black.  </p>
<p>If consolidation happens, then whites will be driven out, but they can&rsquo;t sprawl any eastward in Tennessee, because quite a few years ago, the leftists suckered the state politicians into passing an anti-urban sprawl bill.  So they&rsquo;ll have to flee to north Mississippi.</p>

		<p>What we really have here is the hatred of Whites being by themselves.  That is the enemy the establishment system is eyeing here. &ldquo;The Establishment&rdquo; can&rsquo;t stand Whites-being-by-themselves and so there is a political push to get minorities in close and then intermix them under whatever excuse.  This is so that most unacceptable thing to the establishment (which is based of who has the authority to create the money supply), the thing of Whites-being-by-themselves, can be fought and counteracted.   Can&rsquo;t have that no matter what it takes.  They will dress it up as they are going to call you &ldquo;races&rdquo; if you oppose, but the race push here is to eliminate the existence of a particular race being by itself.  Whites-by-themselves is unacceptable to them.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this will work out, but I am pessimistic.</p>
<p>What people will not say, is that it is indeed about race.</p>
<p>My children went to Houston High School, a Shelby County School, and saved us probably hundreds of thousands of dollars (probably a half-million), since they got an excellent education and we did not have to pay for a private school.</p>
<p>Thre were Asians at Houston, who did very well and were very well-mannered (however, the Chinese looked down on the Koreans, who tended to be loud and somewhat unruly. &#8220;They are the Blacks of the Asian world,&#8221; my son&rsquo;s Chinese friend told him). There were Blacks who were less well-mannered and much less intelligent. </p>
<p>None of the accelerated classes had Blacks, that I saw.</p>
<p>So it IS about race  &mdash;  the intelligent Whites and their cousins, the Asians, want quality schools because they really want to learn. The Blacks would saunter down the halls, as my son told me, blocking the complete width of the hall, so that conscientious students could not get to  their classes on time.</p>
<p>But I must say that there were indeed some intelligent Blacks. Their parents worked hard to move our of Memphis and into Shelby County, to provide them with good schools.</p>
<p>We, in Shelby County, do not want Black carelessness to be the norm, as it will be. The Shelby County schoolboard will have elected to it the same dumba**es who ruined the Memphis City Schools and we all know who they are. And they CANNOT STAND the thought of WHITE EXCELLENCE.</p>
<p>It is so very sad.</p>
<p>Memphis (and Shelby County)  &mdash;  the next Detroit.  </p>

		<p>What does it take to prove? Does anyone even care? Will this madness ever stop or will it just continue to get worse?</p>
<p>How many instances of black integration into what were predominantly white schools will it take to show, this just isn&rsquo;t going to  work?</p>
<p>blacks seem to have the attitude that just being in a certain place is what provides success. That the real estate they are invading is what will make the difference. But that answer is not right at all, it is the attitude of the people in the area that makes the difference. People who don&rsquo;t write and draw on every blank wall, book, and desk that they can lay their hands on.</p>
<p>People who want to study and learn, not come to school when they feel like it dressed like 12 year old thugs, trying to push and intimidate the white boys while spouting their rap to the females. NO it is not being with whites that will raise the intelligence of the black it id realizing they must WORK to get ahead and that the government will not always be able to pay their way and take care of their every need.</p>
<p>This is off topic but reminds me of the illegal invaders who come from a hell on earth to the United States then do everything in their power to turn America into what they fled. Like I said before it is not the real estate/location that makes America great it is the attitude of the people who have come to become good Americans.</p>

		<p>I predict the Obama administration won&rsquo;t do much to support the Memphis blacks&rsquo; efforts to force consolidation with the county schools before the next election. Reason: federal intervention now could be used by the Republicans against Obama in the election, including in &#8220;battleground&#8221; states he needs to win. If he is re-elected - then DOJ will come down hard on the county. And the Feds know there is a chance the courts will ultimately force consolidation.  But for the near term at least, I don&rsquo;t think Memphis will get what it wants.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;To say that we don&rsquo;t want someone because of the color of their skin to me is the most offensive thing someone can say to me,&rdquo; Pickler said.  Well, it isn&rsquo;t the skin color - it&rsquo;s the BEHAVIOR of the black kids that white kids&rsquo; parents don&rsquo;t want their kids to have to endure.  Black kids are disruptive, loud, violent, and threaten non-blacks whenever they get the chance.  When blacks finally get around to telling themselves the truth about their children&rsquo;s behavior, then maybe they&rsquo;ll do something to make their kids behave decently.  Until then, no white parent in her/his right mind would want their kids around black kids.  So, Mr. Pickler, you just go right ahead and be offended - and while you&rsquo;re at it, do whatever needs to be done to stop tolerating unacceptable behavior in black students and in students of every color.  If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re just another guilty white liberal burying his head in the dirt.</p>

Whenever this issue comes up, I always wonder why, instead of transferring kids to different schools, these people don&rsquo;t study the good schools, learn what they do right, and replicate the schools for their own kids.</p>
<p>Of course, I remind myself we&rsquo;re talking about blacks. They can&rsquo;t do anything for themselves. They can only feed off the success of others.</p>
<p>Take and destroy is all they know how to do.</p>

		<p>Ah, contrary to some comments, skin color is important.  It is not a trifle at all.  It is our largest organ and our white skin is not like paint on a universal model human being.  Our white skin is part of the way we have evolved.  So, please, stop accepting the false notion that skin color isn&rsquo;t important.  It is essential to who and what we whites are.</p>

		<p>So the blacks cannot run the school system in a medium sized city that they took over a number of years ago, driving the founding whites away?</p>
<p>So now they want to turn over the mess to whitey, but then all the desegregation garbage will come out and blacks will be bused all over the county, ruining every single school.</p>

		<p>My kids and I are Murderville/Memphis refugees leaving a town called Germantown - the supposedly &#8216;good&rsquo; part of the Murderville area.  Gtown just happens to now be surrounded on 3 sides with thugs so the future for that county is beyond peril.  We moved to W.Nashville 18 months ago and the country music fence appears to be holding ;)</p>
<p>Memphis was a town that received awards in the 70s for cleanest city, best water, quietest town&hellip;it was civilized.  Now turned into a place that is simply too dangerous to raise kids in - to say nothing of sending them to a holding pen/school with that Haitian-like population.  The criminal hatcheries and resident birthing vessels were simply too successful :(  Many many of us that made up the &#8216;old Memphis&rsquo; escaped to W.Nashville (a lot of Detroit refugees here as well).</p>
<p>Best practice for current Murderville MSA residents = refugee out now, N.MS is simply not far enough away from the crime epicenter.</p>

		<p>Asian-Indians have skin darker than Blacks yet we do very well in school, better than whites. We are the proof of the pudding that issue is NOT skin color but behavior. Your average small town white would mistake me for black if they saw me, yet I have an IQ of 140 and am an engineer. Asian-Indians do better than whites despite our dark skin.</p>

		<p>I was hearing rumblings of this but I never did understand how it was happening until now. I knew Shelby County and its residents had no want of the Memphis school system. I have to hand it to Memphis school system though. Their idea was quite ingenious. When the City of Memphis realized it didn&rsquo;t have enough voters on their side to pass a joint ballot initiative approving the merger, they decided to go around it. So if I understand this correctly, they are dissolving the school board and offering it to the county. If the county refuses, there will be cries of racism. The cries of racism will continue to grow louder until either the county relents or the state steps in and forces the county to take it. This is how it will happen, because I&rsquo;m sure the state has no interest in taking it over itself amid the budget cuts and shortfalls it is currently experiencing. </p>

<p>Picklers just sweating the small stuff for the news media. The papers never mention it, but the real issue in this story is obviously that once the merger happens, ALL citizens of our majority black county will get to vote for the board of education. The same voters who have elected the batch of losers now sitting on the MCS board will get to ruin the education of the county students as well. Here&rsquo;s how a typical black Memphian thinks:</p>
<p> &#8220;You know damn well the HAVES will not want to share with the have nots. especially those DIFFERENT from them from the schools to the malls&hellip;&hellip;.and when OTHERS move into their schools, they want to WHITE FLIGHT and put their lads/laddies in the PRIVATE schools, because the HAVES have the YUPPY BUCKS&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
kinda like BAD HISTORY repeating itself&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it any wonder our elected officials are such fools?</p>
<p>Yeah man, that&rsquo;s whats wrong with schools in Memphis. Dat white man at it agin, keepin all de money fo himsef n bein all raciss. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that MCS spends more per student than the county or that its pupils want to be ballers, rappers, and dopeboys (and maybe hustlers if their grades are good enough), its because Whitey wont give them more money. <br>
  <br>
Who knows what will happen once the blacks and liberals gain control of the board? My big fear is that they will then try to pull something funny in a few years like redrawing school zones or bussing to eliminate the performance gap between urban and suburban schools. If they stay segregated, the gap will never close. People will continue to moan just as they do now and something will have to be done about it. When more and more blacks start showing up for class in the suburban schools, property values will go down as they dumb down the school, commit crime, and do the other things blacks do. Whites will move out, and blacks will move in, causing even more whites to move. Then nice places like Germantown (created in the 70&rsquo;s by white flight) are then dead, going down like Hickory Hill did in the 90&rsquo;s or almost all of Memphis did in the 60&rsquo;s. <br>
Today, my parents drive past the run down houses and hoopties in south Memphis, reliving the Memphis of the 1960&rsquo;s, before there were metal detectors at the high school and garbage everywhere and blacks and mexicans glaring at them from their old houses. I imagine I&rsquo;ll be doing the same thing in the neigborhoods of Germantown in 25 years. It couldn&rsquo;t last forever anyway, the ghetto was bound to consume it sooner or later.</p>

		<p>I grew up just outside Memphis and attended Shelby County schools. I attended what was, at the time, probably the darkest elementary / jr high school in the Shelby County School system. It was about 2/3 black and the harassment was pretty bad. The problem was that blacks would go around in packs looking to jump white kids. But the white kids would never stick together. The few times I jumped in to help a white kid who was being ganged up on he would run off and leave me holding the bag. Still I figure it would have been worse at the Memphis City Schools.</p>
<p>When I got married I moved away so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to subject my future children to it. My sister moved across the state line to Desoto County in N Mississippi. The population of Olive Branch started to boom years ago in anticipation of this consolidation. The city can&rsquo;t annex across the state line so it should be safe for a while. In the short term one can expect two things. First, an explosion in students attending private schools. And, second, an acceleration in families moving to N Mississippi. Olive Branch is one of the top 10 school systems in Mississippi. The reason is all the middle &amp; upper middle class families who ran away from Memphis.</p>

		<p>Rajneesh, #9  &mdash;  </p>
<p>From Steve Sailer:</p>
<p>However, a version of the similar TIMSS international math test was given to a sample of Indian students in the states of Orissa and Rajasthan, as reported in a 2009 paper by Jishnu Das of the World Bank and Tristan Zajonc of Harvard, India Shining and Bharat Drowning: Comparing Two Indian States to the Worldwide Distribution in Mathematics Achievement. On average, the Indians performed poorly: &#8220;These two states fall below 43 of the 51 countries for which data exist.&#8221; Note, though, that India was the second-most internally unequal country on TIMSS, behind only South Africa. </p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve argued before in VDARE.com, India is immensely complicated, and thus it&rsquo;s very hard to predict its long-term potential. But, as I wrote in 2006: &#8220;Whatever the cause of the big IQ difference between China and India, it will very likely still remain for the rest of our lifetimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://vdare.com/sailer/101219_pisa.htm</p>
<p>Yes, there are some smart individual Indians. No doubt. But there are a heck of a lot of dumb ones. China is kicking y&rsquo;alls buddhas in the &#8220;big IQ difference between China and India.&#8221; But aren&rsquo;t you guys dark Asians, not dark Africans? </p>

		<p>Tennessee is a great state for our side, our issues - I went to college in Vanderbilt in Nashville Tennessee.</p>
<p>Whites are the overwhelming majority throughout the entire state, with the exception of the City of Memphis. Tennessee is much whiter than Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, particularly West Tennessee. But there is enough of a Black presence and Black problems to make Whites aware there is a problem - it&rsquo;s not like Iowa or Kansas.</p>
<p>Sorry for our good White folks in and around Memphis, but we really need to have one city, area go down badly to bad Black rule, complete with the political officials being aggressive, insulting Black mau mau types. Refugees from Memphis will be much more consistently racially aware, WN activists than others who come across us on the Net and get educated.</p>

		<p>The MORE BLACKS in a school, the greater the drop in the Quality of Education! Nothing hard to grasp here. What better demonstration of how bad public school education can be   &mdash;   than a look at Philadelphia&rsquo;s or New York City&rsquo;s school systems will show.</p>

		<p>blacks are &#8220;cantilevers&#8221;, that live off of, and eventually destroy their supporting host. blacks are &#8220;hyenas&#8221; who steal and pilfer prey from the lion who did all of the work making the kill. blacks are &#8220;uncaring destructive emotional children&#8221; who throw fits of anger and violence at their mothers (white people), and they do this because it works..as someone once said, blacks lack any integrity, or honesty. Thats why they will never admit to right and wrong, because no matter what, they are never wrong. race trumps everything to these people.</p>

<p>If you do better than whites why is your home country such a mess?  Why can&rsquo;t your bright and intelligent people create a working sewage system?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The special status would draw a boundary around the Shelby County school district, protecting its autonomy and tax base &mdash; and, according to Jones, taking $100 million a year from the already underfunded Memphis schools system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curious, then, that the funding per student is $8,640 in the &#8220;underfunded&#8221; Memphis City schools, while in the &#8220;affluent, white, racist&#8221; suburbs it is $7,723, if one can believe the numbers reported in the article.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, funding is not the main indicator of academic success?</p>

		<p>9:  This is a breach in the dam.  Usually, one local media source will tell you how great the downtowns are in all these other cities, and ask why can&rsquo;t our downtown by the same way.  But when you go to the other cities, their downtowns are just as lackluster as ours.  And their local media are asking, &#8220;St. Louis&rsquo;s downtown is booming.  Why can&rsquo;t ours?&#8221;</p>

		<p> People reap what they sow. Some are more aggressive in living by higher rules and thus reap more developed life styles. I cannot see justice in FORCED association&hellip; between low achievers and high achievers&hellip; The higher achievers ought not be enslaved by the slackers.. or by people who desire to have lighter skin. FREEDOM of association is a virtue.. included in our constitution for good reason. I cannot see any justification in this governmental process that seeks to destroy white identity&hellip; using&hellip; fairness as a foil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, contrary to some comments, skin color is important. It is not a trifle at all. It is our largest organ and our white skin is not like paint on a universal model human being. Our white skin is part of the way we have evolved. So, please, stop accepting the false notion that skin color isn&rsquo;t important. It is essential to who and what we whites are.&#8221;</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>It really annoys me when people make assertions that skin (and skin color) is superficial. </p>
<p>Skin color plays a very important role in survival on different levels.</p>
<p>Or the saying &#8220;its only skin deep&#8221; connotating something as irrelevant, small, and meager. Yet skin has the largest surface area of any organ. The idea is laughable to anyone who is intelligent.</p>
<p>It is a lot of disrespect towards Integumentary Scientist and Dermatologist to state such ignorance.</p>
<p>I may not know a lot about race specifically; but, having taken college level Anatomy and Physiology (which is elementary compared to medical professionals studies), I made an oath to rip people apart when they state such things and challenge that assertion.</p>

		<p>It is just a hard fact of life.<br>
blacks lay in wait for non blacks of any race to build something nice or of value. then they push their way into places they really are not wanted.<br>
With Rare Exception blacks main purpose in life seems to be tearing down what other have built.<br>
For someone who has been in America for hundreds of years their command of the English language isn&rsquo;t even on the par of a legal immigrant who has been here 10 years, what is that all about?<br>
It is about NOT wanting to blend in or be equal but rather Special Pampered little troublemakers.</p>

<p>Yes, it is because of their skin color.  That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t want them.  At least have the courage to say it with conviction and without cowering down to the anti-white enemies.  At least say, &#8216;It&rsquo;s a fact.  Majority black communities are unsafe and dangerous places to live in.  You guys get the same amount if not more than we do, yet you are still failing miserably.  No more excuses, no more whining, no more money, and no more trying to intimidate us with the &#8216;racist&rsquo; word.  No more!&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Ted #4 has it right&hellip;</p>
<p>This situation is yet another example of magical thinking by blacks.  Magical thinking is the belief that if you manipulate a symbol of the thing you want, then that thing will happen in reality. In this case, blacks believe that if they move to a place where success is occuring, they too will automatically (automagically) have the same success. </p>
<p>It is simply another form of shamanism, voodoo, cargo cults, or witch doctors. Blacks engage in it by default as part of their natural mindset or cognitive style, as historically exemplified by African tribes, Haiti, Rastafarianism, etc. There are now countless examples here in America, proving that the whole corrupt concept of affirmative action has morphed into a new black subculture based yet again on magical thinking. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The 2010-2011 budget for Memphis City Schools is about $890 million to cover 103,000 students, 85 percent of whom are black. For the 47,000-student Shelby County system, which is 38 percent black, it&rsquo;s more than $363 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>The long term demographics of the Memphis area don&rsquo;t look good.  Whites won&rsquo;t be able to vote themselves away from blacks when they are the minority.  </p>
