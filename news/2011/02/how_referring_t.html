			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Salkeld, Daily Mail (London), February 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A health watchdog has had its funding withdrawn after its chairman was bizarrely accused of racism for using the phrase &#8216;jungle drums&rsquo; to describe gossip.</p>
<p>The innocuous remark at a public meeting was seized upon by an equality campaigner  &mdash;  and the ensuing race row has lasted six months at a cost to the taxpayer of tens of thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>The trouble began at a gathering of the Wiltshire Involvement Network (WIN), an independent health watchdog, in Potterne Wick, Devizes, when chairman Anna Farquhar, 70, noted that gossip about NHS changes had been spreading within the Health Service, remarking: &#8216;You cannot help the jungle drums.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The term comes from the use of wooden drums which were traditionally used in parts of Africa to communicate messages over long distances. </p>
<p>But a member of the public in attendance at the meeting in the local Scout headquarters, Sonia Carr, declared the phrase to be racist. Mrs Farquhar immediately apologised for any offence but Mrs Carr, a member of the Wiltshire Racial Equality Council, was unsatisfied and submitted an official complaint to Wiltshire Council, which launched a costly investigation. </p>
<p>After producing a ten-page report, the council barred all members of WIN from council premises and meetings. It also withdrew funding to cover the group&rsquo;s administration costs.</p>
<p>Fellow WIN members said they were &#8216;astounded&rsquo; that Mrs Farquhar, a distinguished former chief executive of the Citizen&rsquo;s Advice Bureau and St John Ambulance in the Devizes area, had been accused of racism. </p>
<p>&#8216;Anna hasn&rsquo;t got a racist bone in her body,&rsquo; said one. &#8216;The whole thing is ridiculous. It&rsquo;s got to the point where you daren&rsquo;t ask for a black coffee in case somebody takes offence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phil Matthews, WIN&rsquo;s vice-chairman and a member of the local Coalition Against Racism, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s the worst kind of political correctness. Anna&rsquo;s remark was nothing to do with race. This ridiculous decision means that patients in this area do not have a voice and the council is not hearing their concerns about health and social care services.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Carr, 50, who lives with her husband Owen, 54, in Warminster, Wiltshire, claimed Mrs Farquhar&rsquo;s initial apology was inadequate and that watchdog members needed training on &#8216;equality and diversity issues&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;The remark was racist and my complaint is valid,&rsquo; she said yesterday. &#8216;People need to think before they say things that could cause offence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Today, the council is to meet WIN leaders to explain why it upheld Mrs Carr&rsquo;s complaint about the incident on August 10 last year. </p>
<p>John Thomson, deputy leader of the Tory-run council, admitted that &#8216;it may be political correctness&rsquo; but insisted: &#8216;The law makes it clear that what matters is not the intention of the person who uses the phrase but whether anybody is offended by it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However John Glen, the Tory MP for Salisbury, said it was &#8216;ludicrous&rsquo;, adding: &#8216;It is hugely frustrating, at a time when we are trying to save money, that the council is wasting large amounts of money. This kind of unnecessary action and bureaucracy drives the public crazy.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>&lsquo;People need to think before they say things that could cause offence.&rsquo;  Huh?  &#8220;&hellip; could cause offence&#8221;, well that could include anything.  Most Western laws would disallow that. <br>
 &lsquo;The law makes it clear that what matters is not the intention of the person who uses the phrase but whether anybody is offended by it.&rsquo;  Same issue, individuals don&rsquo;t make the laws, the legislature does.  And since when is being offended against the law?  I am offended that there are those that are offended.  Now we are all offended, so what do we do?  Bodily or financial harm is one thing, but offended?  <br>
Freedom of expression is freedom to say things that others may not want to hear.  To bar speech that could offend is to abrogate freedom of expression.</p>

<p>In this day, when people are constantly walking around with chips on their shoulders, such a law is utterly absurd. It is impossible to say anything at all that someone cannot take offense at it. To simply say, &#8220;Hello,&#8221; may be taken as a matter of offense by some grouch who wishes to be offended. This is an utterly asinine law!</p>

		<p>Britain is finished as a European country. It is going to be an outpost of Araby on our border, like Bosnia and a headquarters of terrorism, like Chechnya. The only positive outcome is that once fully empowered, the Muslims will kill the race-traitors who turned the once-great nation over to them. As Mussolini said: &#8220;In politics there is no gratitude.&#8221;  </p>

<p>70 years ago the British didn&rsquo;t worry about offending Hitler or the Germans. Obviously the Germans were evil, or less sensitive than their darker skinned counterparts. </p>

		<p>Was taught in grade school of the early 60&rsquo;s that rhythms of African Tribal drummers were amongst the most complex in music. </p>
<p>Would be a great leap if the music, or spoken language of today&rsquo;s descendants of tribal Africans could even approach in complexity what was expressed by the both musical and communicative medium of jungle drums.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s true, incidents like this create new &#8220;racists&#8221; where none existed before.   Who wouldn&rsquo;t try to avoid someone who&rsquo;s just waiting for you to say something they can claim to find offensive?  </p>

<p>It probably is a kind and &#8216;polite&rsquo; place, tho perhaps not all that pleasant. But the caveat is that this &#8216;kindness&rsquo; is apparent only when looking at whites in England. Non-whites are never muzzled or collared and their foul mouths, foul deeds, and foul actions, are running amok. Britain imports more and more of them (it would be offensive to even Speak against it).</p>
