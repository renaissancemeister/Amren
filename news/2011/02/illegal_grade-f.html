<h1>Illegal Grade-Fixing Allegations Swirl at DPS</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chastity Pratt Dawsey, Detroit Free Press, February 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Science teacher Marjorie Pasqualle struggled in her classroom at Detroit&rsquo;s Durfee Elementary last year  &mdash;  and so did her sixth- and seventh-grade students.</p>
<p>She endured taunts and threats, one student slapped her face and, in a chaotic atmosphere where students weren&rsquo;t learning, she turned in 94 D&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s for June report cards, records show.</p>
<p>But documents also show that the bad grades Pasqualle gave to students were changed to C&rsquo;s on report cards and computerized student records  &mdash;  and without her consent, she said.</p>
<p>The extent of illegal grade-fixing in Detroit Public Schools is difficult to gauge, but teachers, union officials and others say they know it happens, particularly in low-performing schools under pressure to show academic progress.</p>
<p>Teacher Mary Helen D&rsquo;Angelo said a principal passed about three dozen fifth-graders who failed the MEAP test and her summer math class in 2009. &#8220;She told me, &#8216;It must&rsquo;ve been something wrong with your teaching,&rsquo;&#8221; D&rsquo;Angelo recalled recently. &#8220;They came to me with second-grade skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altering records is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $2,500, up to two years in jail and suspension of a teaching certificate.</p>
<p>The Durfee grade-changing matter has been referred to the DPS inspector general in response to questions from the Free Press.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who changes a grade is history,&#8221; said Robert Bobb, emergency financial manager for DPS.</p>
<p><b>DPS teachers feel the pressure to pass failing students</b></p>
<p>Teachers who allege illegal grade-fixing in Detroit Public Schools say the pressure to give passing grades to struggling students is ever-present.</p>
<p>High failure rates reflect badly on a school, but kids who are passed along wind up losing in the end: DPS has a 59% graduation rate and some of the nation&rsquo;s lowest test scores  &mdash;  partly because of the practice of promoting failing students to the next grade, teachers and experts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet grades for as many as 94 science students at Durfee Elementary were changed on student records to passing last year, according to documents obtained by the Free Press. DPS officials are investigating the matter in response to questions from the Free Press, said Jennifer Mrozowski, a spokeswoman for the district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among those who say their grades were changed for dozens of students is DPS teacher Mary Helen D&rsquo;Angelo. She said she was teaching fifth-grade math in summer school at what is now Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in 2009 when her decision to fail most of her 40 students was reversed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Hard to prove</b></p>
<p>There is no way to gauge how often grade-fixing occurs because it is difficult to prove and not widely researched or tracked on a state level or even nationally.</p>
<p>Teacher Tracy Arneau said she failed four first-graders in 2006 who were struggling readers, but the principal promoted them to second grade anyway. By fall, two of the students were placed back in first grade because they were struggling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Administrators and schools with low scores, high failure rates and low graduation rates face dire consequences.</p>
<p>The federal No Child Left Behind law and a state reform law passed in 2009 encourage districts to remove principals and restructure or close schools where students do not meet standards. In 2009, about a quarter of DPS schools were assigned new principals after Bobb fired 33 principals at low-performing schools.</p>
<p>Last year, Bobb replaced the principals and staffs at most of the 51 so-called priority schools he identified for reform. Most of the priority schools had the worst academic achievement levels, including graduation rates below 60%. Principals district-wide also were given new performance-based contracts.</p>
<p>Education historian Diane Ravitch, a former assistant U.S. education secretary who was part of the movement to create No Child Left Behind, said educators are more prone to break rules when under pressure to meet standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;People do funny things when they don&rsquo;t want to be fired, they don&rsquo;t want their schools to close and for money,&#8221; Ravitch said.</p>
<p>DPS teacher Marjorie Pasqualle, who taught sixth- and seventh-grade science classes at Durfee Elementary last year, said her grades were changed after she submitted computerized grade sheets in the spring that contained 68 F&rsquo;s and 26 D&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A grade of C appeared on report cards that were sent home in June with poorly performing students from her classes, records show. {snip}<br>
Pasqualle said she suspects a school official made the changes, but she cannot prove who did it. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pasqualle, 62, said she never confronted anyone about the grades, partly because the school&rsquo;s administration already had deemed her an unsatisfactory teacher, forcing her to retire in July or be fired.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The students who passed</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among Pasqualle&rsquo;s students, children who got C&rsquo;s on their report cards in June included:</p>
<p>* Students who missed the science class more than 20 times in one semester, and one who missed the class 39 times during the year.</p>
<p>* One student who missed the class 37 times, got F&rsquo;s in science all year from Pasqualle and is accused in a police report of simple assault against Pasqualle.</p>
<p>* Students who failed other core classes such as math, social studies and English.</p>
<p>* Thirteen sixth-graders  &mdash;  ages 12 to 14  &mdash;  who already were one or two grade levels behind, according to internal records</p>
<p>* Students who got F&rsquo;s in Pasqualle&rsquo;s class in all prior marking periods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pasqualle said there is a constant fear in DPS that if too many students receive failing grades, they will flee the shrinking school district, costing the coffers $7,660 per student.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Parents outraged</b></p>
<p>Katrina Turner of Detroit, who saw a copy of her son&rsquo;s computerized student report recently, was shocked by the grades. She said her son struggled at Durfee and earned mostly failing grades last year. Pasqualle&rsquo;s grading sheets show she gave him an F in June. But his student records on the DPS computer system show that he earned a C in science in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what? You can&rsquo;t trust what the report cards say now?&#8221; Turner said.</p>
<p>Detroiter Cynthia Pickett was angered, saying her grandson was socially promoted at Durfee after missing most of the spring semester last year.</p>
<p>Attendance records and grading sheets confirm he missed the last month and a half of school and that he earned F&rsquo;s in Pasqualle&rsquo;s science class. However, a C in science appears on his student records within the DPS computer system.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&rsquo;t going, so what was he learning?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2009 at Durfee, only 33% of eighth-graders passed the science MEAP exam compared with 76% of students statewide. Across the district, eighth-graders who took the science portion of the National Assessment of Educational Progress earned the worst scores in 2009 among 18 large cities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Misconduct concerns</b></p>
<p>Changing a student&rsquo;s grade without consulting a teacher is falsification of school records, said Sue Ellen Eisenberg, a Bloomfield Hills attorney who specializes in labor lawsuits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The manner in which the grades were changed at Durfee also constitutes a violation of the teachers union contract, said Keith Johnson, president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers.</p>
<p>In order for a principal to order a grade change, &#8220;the grading teacher must be given an opportunity to respond,&#8221; according to the DFT contract. A grade change form also must be signed by the teacher, Johnson said.</p>

		<p>When I was in Junior High  we got a new science teacher at the end of the year.  One kid was failing becuase of a half a dozen zeros for work that wasn`t even begun, much less completed. So he simply distracted the teacher, found and opened the grade book and wrote in three nines and a seven and an eight in front of those zeros. One he left blank for appearances. <br>
 What won my respect was that he had six different pens prepped and in hand. Medium and fine point, red black and blue.<br>
 When I asked him his final grade he shot me a dodged that bullet look and said, &#8220;I got a B-&hellip;&#8221; Ten years after that he wrecked my Triumph Spitfire escaping from commiting a Bow and Arrow armed robbery. And then it was personal.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In Detroit school system, ninety-four Ds and Fs became Cs on report cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why does it matter?  Grade school advancement occurs whether or not the kid can do the work, and a high school diploma is a worthless piece of paper anymore, especially for blacks who get one just for showing up most of the time.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the REAL world, folks.  No Child Left Behind is the impetus for cheating on every level in the public schools.  Teachers are rated on student performance; the schools themselves are rated on student performance   &mdash;   so if your job or your money depends on you producing passing level students, you&rsquo;re gonna do whatever you have to do to make the students pass, including lying and cheating.  This is what happens when the Feds get involved in public education, which should be a local issue.  If you&rsquo;re a white person who has kids, HOME SCHOOL them, no matter what kind of sacrifices you have to make.  Trust me - we&rsquo;ve done that in our family, and it has paid off handsomely.  You do NOT want your kids in the public pools that are called &#8220;schools&#8221; today.  The kids in public schools are the ones who have parents who basically don&rsquo;t teach ethical, behavioral, or moral standards to their kids, and so we end up with these wretched children who slap teachers and behave outrageously.  Any teacher who puts up with that is crazy - but no school official will stop a kid, especially a black kid, from such behavior.  Got the picture?  HOME SCHOOL your kids, white Americans - for their sake and for the sake of the country!!!</p>

		<p>God Bless all you teachers out there reading this, because I just don&rsquo;t see how you do it.  Assault and being told &#8220;it must be your teaching style&#8221;?!  Why doesn&rsquo;t the poor woman speak her mind and tell them it&rsquo;s impossible to teach children who don&rsquo;t care, with parents who don&rsquo;t care either?  I rarely see one of these articles where they place the blame directly where it should be. This kind of behavior starts at home. Period. These teachers are not miracle workers, and shouldn&rsquo;t have to put up with this stuff for even a second.</p>

		<p>2 Tim McHugh:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a black cheater story from junior high science class of my own.  For three consecutive major tests in the middle of the school year, one of my black classmates was copying off my paper, and I knew it.  Confirmation was that his and my test scores were exactly the same for those three tests.</p>
<p>I was lingering in my frustration one night, then I remembered what my mother always told me about cheating:  Don&rsquo;t, because the person you&rsquo;re copying from might be dumber than you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm, dumber than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one test, I decided to be dumber than him.</p>
<p>But I first had to clear it with the teacher, because I needed to do the test for real at a later time.  My knees were shaking at first, as I was sorta in her doghouse for something unrelated, a flippant remark.  (I bet a lot of you reading this are shocked.)  That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t rat him out earlier to said teacher.  But I worked up the courage, and come to find out, she had long forgiven me, and was acutely suspicious at this given student&rsquo;s high test grades, and saw for herself that his and mine were the same.  So she endorsed the scheme, and I tanked the test while I knew he was copying, and did it for real at lunch that day.</p>
<p>We got the tests back the next class?  I got in the low 90s, he got zero.  He never copied off me again, and in fact, never said word one to me or even looked me in the eye for the rest of that school year.  He wasn&rsquo;t at that school the following year.  Later, the teacher and I were chewing the rag about my scheme, and she told me that the zero combined with his three other &#8220;good&#8221; scores from copying off me averaged out to only slightly above his average for major tests anyway, so all I did was knock him back to his usual normal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t going, so what was he learning?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In other words, you knew he wasn&rsquo;t attending school and now you&rsquo;re angry because he was socially promoted! Why the anger toward the teacher, school personnel, and the school system? Why didn&rsquo;t you and his biological parents do something? Always passing the buck!! Disgusting! Probably looking for a lawsuit!</p>

Confirmation was that his and my test scores were exactly the same for those three tests&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>LOL! This reminds me of my senior year in High School in Detroit many, many years ago. </p>
<p>One day in psychology class the teacher discussed the concepts of intelligence and IQ. He had us all take a standard written IQ test. But made it clear that he would not be collecting the papers when we were finished, and the test score results were for our own eyes only&hellip;..just to see what our  personal IQ&rsquo;s were.</p>
<p>I was sitting in a row of desks that had the back of the seats against the wall of the classroom; facing the class at a 90 degree angle, so as to see the rest of the students from a side view.</p>
<p>The class was all white, but for one black male, who was a member of our school&rsquo;s football team.</p>
<p>The exam started, and we all went to work on it. I was among the first students to complete the IQ test. I remember placing my #2 pencil down on my desk, folded my arms across my chest, leaned back and looked up. Watching the rest of the students hard at work and in deep consintration,&hellip;.except for one&hellip;.the black guy. He was busy looking over at other students papers and copying the answers! </p>
<p>I remember thinking, why is he cheating? No one would know his IQ results but him! I looked over at our teacher who was a classic 1960&rsquo;s Liberal, and saw him watching the whole thing, but he never said a word to stop it.</p>

		<p>James Burnham mentions in his &#8220;Suicide of the West&#8221; the common practice of NY city universities (allegedly) giving minority students grades two levels higher than what they were earning. This was justified at the time by the faculty on the grounds that those students were being discriminated against, therefore this equalized things. </p>
<p>Now here we are, after a couple generations of every piece of liberal social engineering and education program known to modern man, and things have not changed much. Except the slide towards civilizational suicide has been accelerated. </p>
<p>Oh well, maybe Bill Gates can give these science students scholarships&hellip;</p>

		<p>In my school nobody has to change any grades. The principal simply called some teachers on the carpet and politely asked to pass more students. Those teachers who still grade honestly now have to fill out extra paperwork. But don&rsquo;t blame the principals. They are squeezed by school administration just like the teachers. The policy of grade fixing is implemented from the very top. DPS will probably fire the principal and his assistant, but it will not be for changing the grades. It will be for getting caught.</p>

<p>Does anyone else see a problem here?</p>
<p>Are you starting to get an idea of what we have to put up with from &#8220;parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reporter and I&rsquo;m sure school officials wouldn&rsquo;t dream of asking Mr. Pickett  <b>why her grandson missed most of the spring semester.</b></p>
<p>That would be racist.  And, there are a lot of students like this.</p>
<p>But, the kid will be pressured to come to school for the state tests because schools are dinged for each student that misses the test.  Teachers will be blamed for the low scores.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><i>Katrina Turner of Detroit, who saw a copy of her son&rsquo;s computerized student report recently, was shocked by the grades.</i> <b>She said her son struggled at Durfee and earned mostly failing grades last year.</b></p>
<p>Another typical parent.</p>
<p>If asked, she&rsquo;ll tell the media her son&rsquo;s &#8216;mostly failing grades&rsquo; are the fault of his  teachers (to cover her lack of parenting skills and from general all over low IQ) even though black schools receive enormous amounts of money via federal Title 1 funds specifically earmarked for black remediation   &mdash;   money extracted from White taxpayers, not available for White children.</p>
<p>Of course, any remediation for blacks is futile.</p>
<p>But teachers will still be blamed.</p>

<p>Well, now, that&rsquo;s the kind of tactic I would agree with in dealing with cheating blacks.</p>
<p>I was never fortunate enough, however, to be able to pull the same kind of stunt with blacks in my classes, because I never had the rapport with the teacher as you obviously did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rare teacher that would conspire with another student to cause someone to fail a test, then freely discuss the matter with the student involved in the trickery, since even a hint of the incident would be enough to place the teacher on paid leave.</p>
<p>Good for you for putting the cheater in his place.  And good for the teacher who was obviously not one who would raise black F scores to C&rsquo;s.</p>

I see it all the time.  One teacher came up to me the other day and begged me to be an easy grader for her students&rsquo; Regent&rsquo;s tests because her tenure was riding on it.  I had an affirmative action principal once who gave &#8216;missing&rsquo; credits to kids who failed left and right to make himself look good.</p>

		<p>Why not go all the way and give them all &#8220;A&rsquo;s&#8221;?  It would make no difference. They still would not be able to read or to do very simple math problems like 1 + 1. Later on in life they could be affirmative action hires and become TSA screeners or perhaps university professors.  It&rsquo;d still make no difference.  Fantasy and avoidance of the truth never does.</p>

		<p>The word &lsquo;struggle&rsquo; appears so often that I had to check my Oxford – &lsquo;to make a vigorous effort&rsquo;. So are we sure that the DPS has so many &lsquo;strugglers&rsquo;? Heck, I only got out of Grade 9 Math and Biology because I agreed not to enroll in Grade 10 Math and Biology. Both subjects were difficult for me, even with a bit of effort, but I would have done fine if I had &lsquo;struggled&rsquo;. So let&rsquo;s check these &lsquo;strugglers&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Science teacher Marjorie Pasqualle struggled in her classroom&hellip; endured taunts and threats, one student slapped her face&hellip; turned in 94 D&rsquo;s and F&rsquo;s.&rsquo;  Pasqualle certainly suffered and thus likely struggled - most people would struggle to avoid suffering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Teachers who allege illegal grade-fixing &hellip; say the pressure to give passing grades to struggling students is ever-present.&rsquo; Seems unlikely. If, say, 40% of your co-workers/employees/students are failing but only 10% are struggling then people tend to agree, without ever-present pressure, that 30% have to go. People empathize with strugglers and accept that 10% are worth an extra chance. When that chance is up people understand the decision. I just fired a struggler with health and personal issues as her conduct had crossed over from &lsquo;good worker with issues&rsquo; to &lsquo;victim taking advantage&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t feel ever-present pressure, either within myself or from fellow employees, while accommodating her. Ditto for firing her. Flexibility and compassion have been shown but are no longer reciprocal – the team deserves better. </p>
<p>&lsquo;Teacher Tracy Arneau said she failed four first-graders in 2006 who were struggling readers, but the principal promoted them to second grade anyway. By fall, two of the students were placed back in first grade because they were struggling.&rsquo; Heartbreaking really – this is not Grade 8. At age 6 or 7 the strugglers should be the parents – the wee tyke should be co-operative and make an effort but it seems a bit young to struggle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She said her son struggled at Durfee and earned mostly failing grades last year.&rsquo; So this is a quote then? The parent, not the reporter, stated that the kid struggled? We&rsquo;ve got a serious problem here – the kid busts his butt, couple hours a night, cell phone/ I-pod turned off, no distractions – and he fails? Like he couldn&rsquo;t scrape out a C minus with that effort? Time to test for learning disorders followed by a move to a school capable of meeting his special needs. How did he make it through 7 years of school without anyone noticing?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Struggling students need extra help instead of simply being pushed ahead or held back, he said.&rsquo; So you&rsquo;re saying that DPS does not provide this help? Seems unlikely. Seems more likely that they do both – provide the help and push the kid on. Might work better to provide the help and keep the kid at a teachable/slowly advancing level, even if that is Grade 3 content at age 14. That could be tough in a small school but a high school has enough students to form groups of peers that work at a teachable, rather than frustration, level. Being labeled Grade 3 at age 14 is discouraging but being 5 grade levels beyond what you understand must make people really angry.<br>

		<p>I just found an article listed on 2/11/2011 about Houston &ldquo;HISD Proposes Tying Teacher Ratings To Scores&rdquo;. Why don&rsquo;t people realize that some teachers will just manipulate the scores if they get handed a low scoring bunch of students. No one wants to get a lesser of a review or bonus due to no fault of your own.</p>

		<p>I always give a pre-test for reading comprehension before I start teaching any student. I teach high school, and many of my students walk in the first day reading at a 3rd and 4th grade level. While I can show &#8220;growth&#8221; throughout the year, as seen in the post-test, students don&rsquo;t leave reading on grade level. I figure I&rsquo;m covering my rear (and my principal&rsquo;s) with the pre-and post-tests.</p>
<p>I also offer coach class after school. I call parents/guardians to discuss this and set up days for their convenience. NO ONE has ever shown up for coach class. I keep beautiful documentation  &mdash;  phone logs, copies of emails, etc. that I have had occasion to supply during parent conferences.   </p>

		<p>Some of you readers may be fooled, but I am not.</p>
<p>Maybe the tests are Racially Biased so that the Super Intelligent black has no chance of getting it right?</p>
<p>You know blacks invented just about everything, whites would steal the blacks idea and patent it thereby leaving the Genius Inventor out in the cold.</p>
<p>They claim to have been Kings and Queens in days gone by and to have established almost all prosperous civilizations .. WHAT THE HECK HAS HAPPENED HERE ?</p>
