			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, Daily Mail (London), February 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Not so long ago, I sat in a nursery class in Wandsworth, South London, where a teacher was conducting a test to discover how the children felt about their race.</p>
<p>She asked each youngster to hug the doll in the classroom that looked most like them.</p>
<p>Naomi, a black girl, at once grabbed a blonde, blue-eyed doll and wouldn&rsquo;t let go. Tears rolled down her face when it was gently taken from her.</p>
<p>What, I wonder, was the poor mite thinking and feeling? How could it be that even at nursery school she somehow understood this was the most beautiful, desirable doll  &mdash;  the one she wanted to look like?</p>
<p>Too many black and Asian children grow up understanding the sad truth that to have dark skin is to be somehow inferior.</p>
<p>The young daughter of one of my relatives even tried to scrub her &#8216;dirty&rsquo; skin off with a Brillo Pad, such was her loathing for her natural colour.</p>
<p>Of course, black and Asian parents work hard to give their children a positive self-image and confidence in their appearance, despite the cultural forces stacked against them.</p>
<p>But when black celebrities appear to deny their heritage by trying to make themselves look white, I despair for the youngsters who see those images.</p>
<p>One black friend of mine, who has a 13-year-old daughter, was incandescent this week when she saw the picture of U.S. singer Beyonce at a pre-Grammy awards party.</p>
<p>Her complexion and limbs were translucently pallid, her locks long, straight and blonde.</p>
<p>Now, racial mixing since the days of slavery means &#8216;black&rsquo; Americans come in a whole range of skin hues, but in recent years Beyonce&rsquo;s tone seems miraculously to be changing from dusky to peachy.</p>
<p>In truth, it is hard now to tell she is the daughter of an African-American father and Creole mother. It was three years ago that L&rsquo;Oreal was accused of whitening Beyonce&rsquo;s face in a magazine advert, a charge denied by the company. But now there she is, looking like a willowy Caucasian.</p>
<p><br>
When she saw the pictures, my friend told me: &#8216;My little girl Ciara is 13, her hair is curly and I don&rsquo;t let her straighten it, and she has a beautiful toffee-coloured skin tone.</p>
<p>&#8216;In our small village, everyone else is white and it&rsquo;s never affected her. But now, she has seen Beyonce and she is telling me she hates her hair and wants to lighten it and straighten it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On one level, you might say this altering of appearance is just women enjoying themselves  &mdash;  selecting different colours, shapes and styles to become what they want. But there is more to it than that; precisely because they never make themselves look darker.</p>
<p>In Bollywood, top actresses were once curvy and a range of skin shades. Now, they are all fair, skinny and are chosen for their green or blueish eyes  &mdash;  or they simply wear coloured contact lenses.</p>
<p>Women of colour across the world spend a lot of money, time and emotional energy on treatments to achieve an appearance which the Western world defines as perfection: usually blonde, thin, light skinned and with European features.</p>
<p>So what, they would say. If it&rsquo;s OK for white women to turn to plastic surgery, diet to the point of extinction and colour their hair, why can&rsquo;t black and Asian women reinvent themselves without being accused of betraying their racial heritage?</p>
<p>The answer is that every woman of colour has an important social and cultural history that cannot simply be bleached away or denied by the use of hair straighteners. That&rsquo;s why I passionately believe that Beyonce&rsquo;s ignorance of how this betrays her heritage is so insidiously damaging to all peoples of colour.</p>
<p>At a time when the U.S. has a half-Kenyan President whose wife and daughters are black and proud, why are non-European features, body shapes and colours still thought not beautiful or alluring? And why has Beyonce just reinforced that message?</p>
<p>It could be that she felt she needed a more mainstream image to survive in a highly competitive entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Superstar Tina Turner modified her appearance so she wasn&rsquo;t seen as a black singer by dyeing her hair blonde, and when she and I once met, her skin looked lighter to me than it once had.</p>
<p>Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald, on the other hand, didn&rsquo;t feel they had to make adjustments to their appearance, though they never came close to Turner&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Today, Hollywood may love Halle Berry with her light brown skin tone, but obviously black actresses by and large don&rsquo;t make the A-list.</p>
<p>The truth is that though things are slowly changing for the better, skin still matters and, on the whole, the world believes it is better not to be dark.</p>
<p>Surveys in the U.S. have proved that, all things being equal, the lighter skinned that people are, the more chances they get in life, and the more respect they receive.</p>
<p>In most countries, even in Africa and on the Indian sub-continent, black and dark brown skin and frizzy hair are seen as an impairment and a curse.</p>
<p>My mother was a just and good woman and believed we were all God&rsquo;s children, yet she didn&rsquo;t let me drink tea or coffee because she thought they darkened the skin.</p>
<p>Instead, she plastered my face with a paste of flour, lemon and milk  &mdash;  her very own skin-lightening cream.</p>
<p>I found the stuff hateful, as much for what it revealed about my mother&rsquo;s beliefs as anything else. If you doubt the power of this prejudice against colour, consider that only last week an Asian mother who lives in London contacted me to describe how she has just been thrown out by her husband and in-laws.</p>
<p>And her crime? Five days before, she had given birth to a daughter who was not, as she described it, the colour of a Milkybar. And this was a child with two Asian parents.</p>
<p>These prejudices are vile. And the more celebrities deny their racial heritage in the way they alter their appearance, the more desperate young women will keep using the often untested and damaging skin-lightening creams sold in &#8216;ethnic&rsquo; beauty shops around the world, including in Britain.</p>
<p>Demand is high, too, for dangerous hair-taming products, some of which burn the hair and scalp.</p>
<p>So why do all these women want to be whiter? The warped values they subscribe to evolved out of colonialism: white people were not only powerful but like mythical gods, physically superior and invincible.</p>
<p>The rulers believed it, and their subjects ingested the message. In India, the skin hierarchy was set down before the time of the Raj by Mogul aristocrats who were light-skinned.</p>
<p>So why do these attitudes persist so long after independence in the 21st century? Academics studying these trends say it is because of globalisation and the emergence of &#8216;international beauty&rsquo; prototypes, based on the looks you see in fashion magazines and films.</p>
<p>And so it is that cosmetic surgeons are inundated  &mdash;  particularly in the Far East, in countries such as Singapore, where hundreds of women pay to have plastic surgery to make them look more Western.</p>
<p>In other words, they are wilfully shedding their own cultural heritage in favour of a more recent and more fashionable ideal. Anything goes now  &mdash;  if you can pay for it you can become what you want, and like many black and Asian stars, turn black to white.</p>
<p>But these idols are shallow and do not understand how their frivolous choices affect and undermine the self-esteem of women and children of colour.</p>
<p>I know these stars are under pressure to sell records and magazines.</p>
<p>But do they have to go white? Do they know what effect that has? Clearly not.</p>
<p>Beyonce&rsquo;s unique, sensual beauty owed much to her racial and ethnic background.</p>
<p>That, it seems, was just not good enough, not even for her, a woman who has conquered the world. What hope then for all the rest?</p>

		<p>Who says life is fair?  (No pun intended.)  Lighter (not necessarily &#8220;white&#8221;) skin has always been considered a sign of female beauty in Asian cultures, particularly the more advanced, such as Brahman Hindu, Japanese, Chinese, and throughout the muslim world. The blue-eyed blond ideal was not always thus, but had become so with the expansion of international cinema, mostly due to Hollywood. (Blond hair, and, especially, blue eyes, tend to film better.)  And maybe, just maybe, there is a built-in universal standard for beauty, and Caucasian looks are it.</p>

		<p>It seems as if one of these breathless minority commenters writes about some celebrity betraying their dark skin weekly.  Look, most people, of all races, liken light skin on a female to be more beautiful and womanly.  That&rsquo;s just how it is.  </p>
<p>&#8220;every woman of colour has an important social and cultural history that cannot simply be bleached away or denied by the use of hair straighteners.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if this woman believes in interracial couples?  If she truly believes what she says about the beauty of dark skin shouldn&rsquo;t she be against the white woman-dark man couple that is so prominent nowadays?  Is diversity only OK when it dilutes white genes?</p>

<p>Why, indeed ? I can see but one solution to this distasteful situation : let&rsquo;s create a Department of Beauty which will get to decide what and whom we should find beautiful.</p>

		<p>I personally think her photos are doctored unless she had some &#8220;Michael Jackson&#8221; cosmetic procedures done.  You can look at her sometimes and she&rsquo;ll look very black and other times she&rsquo;ll have a sort of honey colored look about her but her facial features are still obviously watered down African.  I wish black women and other races would stop trying to be White and just be happy with who they are.  Take away the cosmetic surgery, fake hair, photoshop techniques, special lighting and skin bleaching creams and what are you left with?   </p>

<p>Since the preference for lighter skins as expressed through the caste system amongst Indian people predates colonialism by several thousand years it seems unlikely that colonialism can be at fault. In all Asian societies, going back for thousands of years, lighter skin has always been associated with higher class and refinement.</p>
<p>Still, never let the facts get in the way of an excuse to blame everything on white &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really CARE what Beyonce does, says, thinks, or looks like.  The fact is, her manager has figured out what sells, and s/he has gotten his/her client to go for the gold.  That&rsquo;s Gollywood, folks, and if you think it isn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re naive.  I&rsquo;ve lived here most of my life, have a number of friends in &#8220;The Industry,&#8221; and money is the name of the game.  Beyonce isn&rsquo;t the first and won&rsquo;t be the last to try and cash in on &#8220;the light side.&#8221;  And, well, personally, I&rsquo;ve always been attracted to blondes or redheads with green, hazel, or blue eyes.  It&rsquo;s kind of inbred, you know?  Oh, and the big tatas help too&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Probably they won&rsquo;t have that problem much longer. When Muslim law is imposed on (formerly) Jolly Old England, and the women required to wear the burqa, an English woman&rsquo;s appearance will be of concern only to her husband/owner.</p>

<p>So right.</p>
<p>For thousands of years Asian women tried to get whiter. For hundreds of years Europeans tried it. The term &#8220;blue blood&#8221; meaning somebody to royal is from the royal Europeans which tried so hard to get whiter that their veins could be seen.<br>
In India the whole cast system was build on skin color.</p>
<p>In Arab countries Hana or &#8220;Hinne&#8221; is a common term for a color powder which makes the black hair browner for several weeks.</p>
<p>The first thing people do, when they want to &#8220;photoshop&#8221; a picture of a woman (Photoshop is a program for changing pictures and make them more beautiful) is to make her skin whiter.</p>
<p>Before I get a race realist, I was just shocked about Nigeria in which more and more women try out new creams to make their black skin more brown.</p>
<p>Only really stupid people can ignore history. can ignore common sense, can ignore cultures all around the world and can say White and Black is equal.</p>

Wrong.  Beauty is beauty.  If white people were the conquered non-white people would still dye their hair blond, wear blue or green contacts, bleach their skin, East Asians would still get eyelid surgeries among all the other surgeries they get to look white, black Africans would still try to straighten their hair and get rhinoplasty.  White people are the only group that has every natural hair and eye color.  White people (those of European background) have exclusively the 12 lightest skin colors (out of 38) according to the von Luschan chromatic scale.  There is a diversity of natural looks among white people that is not found in non-white populations.  Another significant factor is white people&rsquo;s hair usually gets darker as they mature meaning lighter hair among white people is a sign of youth.  These non-white people are piggybacking off the natural processes of white people by dying their hair lighter colors to make themselves look youthful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also skeptical of that recent Beyonce picture.  You can see a shadow from the SUV tire yet Beyonce has no shadow.  I suspect Beyonce has lightened her skin, I just don&rsquo;t think she went this far.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because her teachers were most likely all white? No big mystery here, but of course when there&rsquo;s more than one possible explanation for a phenomenon, the leftist must always embrace the one that points to &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other people don&rsquo;t like themselves. And she admits that her own mother even used a homemade skin lightening cream on her. Yet she wants to blame whites for it??? </p>

		<p>The author claims that the Obama women are &#8220;black and proud&#8221;, yet they all have straightened hair.  Years ago, I saw an Oprah show in which people debated the use of green and blue contact lenses by black women.  An audience member, complaining of blacks trying to look white, was silenced by another who pointed out that the complainer had straightened hair.  <br>
Beyonce is more white than she is black.  Trying to make her &#8220;blacker&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t respect her as a unique person, and none of us is under any obligation to celebrate one part of our ethnic makeup while ignoring another.  <br>
As far as lightness being thought attractive, it has been for thousands of years, just as the term &#8220;fair lady&#8221; indicates.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why are non-European features, body shapes and colours still thought not beautiful or alluring?&#8221;</p>
<p>They obviously are attractive to people of the same race.  They must be.  I&rsquo;ve seen some very, very, very, very ugly black women with 5-6 kids.  If the father(s) of these kids weren&rsquo;t attracted to them they wouldn&rsquo;t have &#8220;hit dat&#8221;.  The real problem here is that minorities want White people to find them attractive and alluring which is unhealthy for their self-esteem.  It&rsquo;s also a way to get Whites to miscegenate with them and muscle in on modeling jobs or roles in movies for which they&rsquo;re totally unsuited. I remember working with an oriental woman who had eyelid surgery to round her eyes.  The procedure made her eye sockets look really big, something I&rsquo;ve seen on an oriental man as well.  It&rsquo;s very odd looking and sometimes I would catch myself staring at her in disbelief.  </p>

		<p>Once upon a time, even white women tried to keep their skin VERY white.  In Queen Elizabeth I&rsquo;s time, white flour was used.  The direct sun was abhored.  That carried over into colonial times.  Even here in America right up to the gay 90&rsquo;s (1890&rsquo;s).  White women used large hats, covered arms and legs, and parasols to keep the sun off their skin and keep their skin white.  None tried to &#8220;suntan&#8221; and make their skin darker.<br>
That lunacy came in the 20th century.  So what we have now is colored peoples trying to look White, and White people trying to look like mulattos.  All, I am sure, from media and entertainment brainwashing as to what is &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.  And of course, we know who owns the entertainment industry and writes the scripts, don&rsquo;t we?  Too consistently to be an accident or coincidence that whites are told to look and act more African, while Africans know those who own media and entertainment will only hire light skinned models and actresses when money and profit is involved.  Black is NOT beautiful or attractive and blacks have too many well proven stereotypes that go against pitching a product or representing a company trying to sell quality, integrity and mass appeal.</p>

Like the ability to take, and take, and take, and take, and then COMPLAIN about the whites who pay for it all??? People, these statements MUST be combatted every time we hear them and FIERCELY.

		<p>&#8220;At a time when the U.S. has a half-Kenyan President whose wife and daughters are black and proud, why are non-European features, body shapes and colours still thought not beautiful or alluring?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m mixed on this comment. Saharan women tend to be more attractive to Saharan men, etc. Caucasian women tend to be more attractive to White men. This goes also for the other gender. It is retrospective to some degree based on genetic similarities and deviation to racial groups that are near each other. Of course there is exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>I do believe however there is objectivity to beauty as well and it is no subjective or in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>One argument that beauty is associated with whites is that this is originally a white country and so beauty is geared to toward whites so from a social hierarchy standpoint, whites are on top. I don&rsquo;t know if you went to a current Africa country that hasn&rsquo;t been influenced by whites, what you would find for &#8220;beauty.&#8221; This can go with the racial groups being more likely to date amongst themselves idea.</p>
<p>Another argument, the liberal argument, is that evil white people try to keep black people down (mainly black women) by also perpetrating white women in the media. This argument I don&rsquo;t agree with because it I don&rsquo;t believe in a &#8220;the media&#8221; conspiracy to keep people down. But as shown many black women go along rather than fight against this supposed &#8220;oppression.&#8221; Which either says to things 1) black women are so weak willed and so stupid that they submit to such forms of beauty 2)black women are trying to, due to mating tactics, like any other women see some form of objection to beauty and use it to be more likely to find a mate.</p>
<p>Another argument is that beauty has very objective connotations associated with it as well as arousal. Different factors play into what is viewed a beauty, from an objective standpoint, across all cultures. One such is symmetry (which can be in all racial groups in varying degrees).</p>
<p>White is associated with fair, as in &#8220;fair&#8221; skin (light complexion). When you look up the definition of fair you get this: &#8220;Of pleasing appearance, especially because of a pure or fresh quality; comely&#8221; or this &#8220;Free of clouds or storms; clear and sunny&#8221; or &#8220;Free of blemishes or stains; clean and pure&#8221; or &#8220;Having or exhibiting a disposition that is free of favoritism or bias; impartial&#8221; source:http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fair</p>
<p>As you can see fair has many meanings like &#8220;good,&#8221; &#8220;just,&#8221; &#8220;pure.&#8221; But I believe it goes farther. Fair is closely associated with heavenly; divine. There is many non white cultures that emulate this concept. Hell the Aztecs thought of Cortez, a man belonging to a racial group they have never seen, as one of their Aztecs gods. </p>
<p>I believe this objection goes even within whites. Nordicism, a very finite movement, is seen from an objective standpoint as more beautiful than other whites. Blue eyes is associated with the heavens or reflect the sky; celestial if you may. While this may be taboo or politically incorrect, I do believe there is a sexual hierarchy if you will amongst all people and between people. </p>
<p>Many customs like it China women wear white makeup. I don&rsquo;t think it is for show or mocking white women. It is something that they see as beautiful and want to emulate in some way (which is way before media or TVs).</p>
<p>The media focuses on such white women not out of hatred or disdain for other people but out of money that Caucasian women sell more. Why? Because they are more alluring. Even today black women are getting as much attention, if not more, in films, yet people value Caucasian. It is found in multiple societies and situations throughout history.</p>

		<p>I believe it was in 1967 that the &#8220;Black is Beautiful&#8221; campaign took off, and everybody got on board with afro hair, corn rows, African names like Uhuru. Yet after two generations of pride and propaganda, it still has not taken. The fish have not taken the bait.</p>
<p>   A short while ago super model Naomi Campbell was whining and whinging about the &#8220;racism&#8221; of the fashion world and world at large, because so many runway models are Whites. She had been anointed and elevated to this position by the elites of the fashion houses in Milan and Paris, her face had adorned the front covers of those expensive magazines, and she had earned the big bucks. Yet none of it was good enough, and she was left finally bitter and angry. Perhaps in the end she realized she had been nothing but an affirmative action pawn, and that the empress had no clothes. </p>

The only thing I know about this Beyonce is that she&rsquo;s a mulatto rapper who did Old Navy commercials.  I have to wonder if this article is a publicity stunt to get people to notice her.  The same when Kanye West (I have no idea who that is) upstaged the beautiful Taylor Swift at an awards ceremony to put in a plug for this woman. Black people must crave attention from Whites.  </p>

		<p>This is obviously a nonsense story. </p>
<p>First, the &#8220;grabbing the white doll&#8221; stories have been debunked for over a decade. Just didn&rsquo;t happen, even in the racist fantasies of liberal psychology. </p>
<p>Second, Blacks and minorities are toadied to at every opportunity. &#8220;I am a special person!&#8221; &#8220;I&rsquo;m Black and powerful!&#8221; &#8220;I&rsquo;m appallingly stupid, but feel good about it!&#8221; The egos of morons are pumped every time they watch or listen to any modern media. They may have self esteem problems, but it isn&rsquo;t low esteem.</p>
<p>Third, you can train anyone to photoshop at this level. It&rsquo;s dirt easy. If Beyonce is white, make her black. If she&rsquo;s black, make her red. Slapping paint on a model is easy, repainting a photo is literally childs play. .</p>
<p>Fourth, have you looked at the behavior of women in general? We aren&rsquo;t marrying them because they&rsquo;re feminine chicka. It&rsquo;s pathetic when women try to be men. Doesn&rsquo;t work for them, doesn&rsquo;t work for us.</p>

<p>Now we find that &#8220;asia&#8221; includes indo-pak-bengalis, orientals of various types, filipinos in the south to nearly white central asians in the north.  </p>

		<p> Sometimes I wonder if whites support the idea of &ldquo;black beauty&rdquo; because we realize that blacks are generally unattractive while we are generally (but not always) easy on the eyes. We have hair and eyes in many different colors and skin that is naturally fair. Our hair is naturally flowing and straight.<br>
I have never found dark skin, African facial features, or kinky hair attractive, I just don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve never stated this to black people I know, simply because it is mean and why would I want to poke fun at them for something they can&rsquo;t change? But I can&rsquo;t help but giggle when people speak of &ldquo;black beauty&rdquo;.<br>
