<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An angry mob attacked a reporter and a photojournalist Sunday, but it wasn&rsquo;t in the Middle East, it was in California.</p>
<p>The journalists were hit and pushed by family and friends of a young man who had been gunned down the night before outside an International House of Pancakes restaurant in Sacramento.</p>
<p>FOX 40 News reporter John Lobertini and his cameraperson, Rebecca Little, were assaulted after approaching a group of people standing near a memorial for 27-year-old Chester Jackson set up on the sidewalk outside the restaurant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several local news outlets were present at the time and captured the incident on video from different points of view.</p>
<p>In the footage, Lobertini can be seen approaching a handful of people standing by the memorial as Little recorded the encounter. A woman in glasses and a hoodie quickly begins yelling at the journalists, the video shows, as another in a white cap calmly asks the reporters to &#8220;just back off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within moments, however, several people approach from further down the sidewalk. A man in a purple t-shirt shoves Little&rsquo;s camera away; then a woman in a white button-down sweater is seen in the video screaming at the photojournalist. Little is forced backwards as the woman stomps towards her.</p>
<p>Three other women hold the lady in the white sweater back, but another runs in from further up the sidewalk, grabs Little&rsquo;s hair, and throws her to the ground in video captured by ABC 10 News. Lobertini attempts to help his coworker, but appears to get punched by the man in the purple shirt.</p>
<p>The woman in the white sweater then appears in the video to kick Little as she lay in the tall grass between the sidewalk and the street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lobertini was then pushed away as the anger of the crowd seemed to boil over. The group pushed and shoved the reporter while screaming at him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other reporters at the time were also threatened, including a photographer for the Sacramento Bee newspaper, according to News 10.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities are looking at the video to determine if any charges need to be filed. No arrests have been made.</p>

		<p>This is extremely tame as far as non White on White assaults go. IMO, it is highly unlikely that any charges will be filed. Of course if you reversed the racial roles, it would be front page news for weeks and hatecrimes charges would definitely be filed. No doubt calls for sensitivity training as well as calls for a monetary settlement would be forthcoming as well. </p>

		<p>Looks to me like the blacks and Mexicans just wanted someone to yell at and beat up on, and of course the 2 white journalists made perfect victims.  Two whites attacked by a mob of blacks and Mexicans - looks like a real fair fight, doesn&rsquo;t it?  It&rsquo;s nothing unusual.  It won&rsquo;t even rate a passing glance by the TV news.</p>

		<p>OUT OF CONTROL! This has become the &#8220;danger&#8221; signal for whites all across the country! When I was in my early teens I witnessed an altercation between some blacks. It was brutal! A young black woman stood there and sliced a black man with a razor knife while two ofher cohorts held the guy. He was bleeding beyond the point of help. I later learned that the guy being &#8220;sliced&#8221; by the woman was her &#8220;cousin!&#8221; Nice? As you see in this video blacks just go &#8220;hog wild and completely crazy&#8221; whenever they are agitated by alcohol, drugs, or common human agitation! What does it take for whites to see that blacks are incapable of living in a civilizied society? </p>

		<p>I dought the two Whites that were attacked are one of us. No racially awake Whites would bother to cover a &#8220;memorial&#8221; to some thug - oops - &#8220;young man&#8221; gunned down in front of an IHOP [ I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll have to rename it the &#8216;Chester Jackson&rsquo; IHOP now, complete with statue ]. No, these two liberals were there to get the &#8220;real&#8221; story on how ol Chester was &#8220;just starting to get his life together, how he was a good boy that just got caught up in the wrong crowd, how he was going to be a doctor - lawyer -  astronaut -  rap &#8216;artisss&rsquo; - and &#8216;bassetball&rsquo; playa all at the same time&#8221; yada-yada-yada!<br>
Every time those two got smacked, the harder I laughed!</p>

		<p>The reporter came alone at a time when people&rsquo;s feelings are running very high. Shame on them(reporter/camera person)<br>
But at the same time manners are manners. Today people think that they can act like pigs and than get mad that people disapprove of there behavior. Shame on the women who were acting like they did and shame on the men that were trying to make it into a fight. I think the whole thing was shameful on both sides. <br>

		<p> Chester Jackson presumably was &#8220;good to his momma&#8221; and &#8220;trying to get his life together&#8221; when he was gunned down by some of his soul bruthuhs. So how dare this &#8220;privileged&#8221; White TV news crew approach his sacred memorial?</p>
<p> So typical of blacks to gang up on two unarmed, inoffensive White people when they saw there was no one at hand to stand up for the news crew. And by the way, aren&rsquo;t there any police in Sacramento? How long does it take them to get to the scene of a public mugging?</p>
<p> &#8220;No arrests have been made&#8221;? I&rsquo;m certainly no lawyer, but in watching the video I saw intimidation, assault, battery, just to name the first three that come to mind. Do the authorities in Sacramento need an engraved invitation to get them to enforce the laws?</p>

		<p>I have zero sympathy for anyone who shoves a camera &amp; microphone into the face of mourners, especially in such an emotional situation as this, when the death was violent &amp; just happened the day before.  The reporters got what they deserved.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amusing, though, that they apparently never saw it coming. Let&rsquo;s go up to that group of angry, hurting black folks with a camera &amp; ask them some nosey insensitive questions.  What could go wrong?  </p>
<p>Maybe next time they&rsquo;ll climb into a zoo enclosure full of very hungry tigers.  That should go well also. </p>

		<p><i> The journalists were hit and pushed by family and friends of a young man who had been gunned down the night before outside an International House of Pancakes restaurant in Sacramento. </i> </p>
<p>This is a classic case of misplaced hostilities. Rather than being hopping mad at the perpetrators and the society that has made such incidents so common, they take out their frustrations on the photojournalists who are documenting the aftermath of this incident. Notice also that they are showing extremely poor anger management, which is exactly why California has become so dangerous in the first place. The loudest woman, who keeps screaming about &#8220;invasion of privacy&#8221; (outside a restaurant, no less) appears to be Hispanic. Perhaps deep down she&rsquo;s mad at the journalists for documenting her people&rsquo;s natural violent tendencies.</p>

		<p>Why would the news station feel that some black gunned down in an IHOP parking lot worthy of news coverage? You can see the thuggery on display by those who are &#8220;grieving&rdquo;, which leads me to believe the thug who was shot probably had a predisposition for similar behavior.  </p>

    Futhermore, look at the way they are dresssed. In my day you dressed formally for a funeral, not like these slobs.<br>

		<p>#2 Tim makes a good point about &#8220;any complaint reasonably expressed.&#8221; But there were only seconds between that complaint being reasonably expressed and a mob engaging in what can only be described as typical behavior. It actually was fairly tame compared to some of the things I&rsquo;ve seen. But, still, it&rsquo;s the same thing over and over. Loud women screaming and hollering, grabbing and snatching, waving their arms like maniacs. And then a large mob physically attacking one or two people. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note these people were relatives of someone who had been gunned down. I can only speculate that the deceased engaged in comparably unacceptable behavior. And that someone just like him didn&rsquo;t like it and killed him. That&rsquo;s why so many blacks are killed by blacks. They treat others unacceptably. And then they kill others when they are treated unacceptably.</p>

		<p>People here need to plan and practice what they will do in similar situations, train and don&rsquo;t go to the gun fantasies. Learn to be able to handle loud, aggressive Blacks, non Whites who are pushing, threatening, escalating. Learn how to not show fear and just handle things. Some keys to survival.</p>
<p>Stay on your feat, guard your head - you may get a few bumps and bruises, but death or serious injury will not happen if you keep your feet. It&rsquo;s when you get knocked to the ground and the mob tries to kick your head in - that&rsquo;s when things get really bad.</p>
<p>Learn to fight a bit more unfair, without killing anyone. Short of fighting with a gun or a BIG knife, what kind of weapons can you use for legitimate self defense that will not get you persecuted by PC multi cult authorities?</p>
<p>For middle aged men, I recommend.</p>
<p>Walking canes<br>
Strong umbrellas<br>
large heavy plastic magic markers (for strikes to the eyes and neck, protects your hands)</p>

<p>News reporters like to bully people. Many times they provoke whites into taking a poke at them. This is no different accept the blacks have less self control. Nothing will happen to either the white reporters or the dark perpetrators.</p>

		<p>The journalists&rsquo; decision to approach, camera running, without negotiating some kind of prior consent, a group of persons aggrieved by the recent shooting death of a friend/relative was wrong headed. [The decedent&rsquo;s blood was still smeared on the sidewalk!]  I thought the press would have approached one of the group off camera and asked for an on camera interview.  That they did not here was an insult.  The journalists behaved like jerks, and, as a result, we all get to chatter about the big Sacto IHOP imbroglio, soon to win a Pulitzer nomination.  </p>

		<p>Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t stand nosey, self-important journalists. They got back up again and the camera remained intact, so IMO this was pretty tame. Our two favorite minorities here are just doing what white people would do, if we didn&rsquo;t have superior impulse control and sense of possible consequence.</p>

		<p>Have you ever noticed that in all incidents like this blacks just seem to be waiting for an excuse to &#8220;swarm&#8221;?  The video appears to be like a &#8220;bee-hive&#8221; of blacks attacking whites(of course you cannot overlook the lippy hispanic).  Regardless how you feel about the white news crew there is no excuse for this to happen over &amp; over.  For those that excuse the blacks and feel that the reporters got what they deserve you are just digging the hole deeper until it happens to you or your loved ones.  &#8220;The beginning of the end&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has lived in California has passed dozens of these<br>
memorials. A few stuffed animals, some cards, a balloon.<br>
In East LA every corner has them..each memorial says<br>
Hispanic Gang Member killed here..black gang member killed<br>
there&hellip;and still the cult of mass immigration and multi<br>
culturalism goes on..still degradation of American society<br>
into chaos proceeds..and the mass media makes money filming it.</p>
