			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, February 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A fight is brewing in Mississippi over a proposal to issue specialty license plates honoring Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Division of Sons of Confederate Veterans says it wants to sponsor a series of state-issued license plates to mark the 150th anniversary of what it calls the &#8220;War Between the States.&#8221; The group proposes a different design each year between now and 2015, with Forrest slated for 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221; state NAACP president Derrick Johnson said when he was told about the Forrest plate. &#8220;Wow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forrest, a Tennessee native, is revered by some as a military genius and reviled by others for leading the 1864 massacre of black Union troops at Fort Pillow, Tenn. Forrest was a Klan grand wizard in Tennessee after the war.</p>
<p>Sons of Confederate Veterans member Greg Stewart said he believes Forrest distanced himself from the Klan later in life. It&rsquo;s a point many historians agree upon, though some believe it was too little, too late, because the Klan had already turned violent before Forrest left.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>State Department of Revenue spokeswoman Kathy Waterbury said legislators would have to approve a series of Civil War license plates. She said if every group that has a specialty license plate wanted a redesign every year, it would take an inordinate amount time from Department of Revenue employees who have other duties.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Robert McElvaine, director of history department at the private Millsaps College in Jackson, joined the Facebook group. McElvaine said Forrest&rsquo;s role at Fort Pillow and involvement in the Klan make him unworthy of being honored, even on the bumpers of cars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mississippi lawmakers have shown a decidedly laissez-faire attitude toward allowing a wide variety groups to have speciality license plates, which usually sell for an extra $30 to $50 a year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Department of Revenue allowed the group to revise the license plate this year for the first of the Civil War sesquicentennial designs. The 2011 plate, now on sale, depicts the Beauvoir mansion in Biloxi, Miss., the final home of Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president.</p>
<p>SCV wants license plates to feature Civil War battles that took place in Mississippi. It proposes a Battle of Corinth design for 2012 and Siege of Vicksburg design for 2013. Stewart said the 2015 plate would be a tribute to Confederate veterans.</p>
<p>Johnson, with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he&rsquo;s not bothered by Civil War commemorative license plates generally. But he said Mississippi shouldn&rsquo;t honor Forrest, who was an early leader of what he calls &#8220;a terrorist group.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He should be viewed in the same light that we view Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden,&#8221; Johnson said of Forrest. &#8220;The state of Mississippi should deny any vanity tags which would highlight racial hatred in this state.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If they want a tag commemorating veterans of the Confederacy, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it,&#8221; said Bailey [Democratic Rep. Willie Bailey, who handles license plate requests in the House], who is black. &#8220;They have that right. We&rsquo;ll look at it. As long as it&rsquo;s not offensive to anybody, then they have the same rights as anybody else has.&#8221;<br>

		<p>General Forrest is one of the best cavalry leaders who ever lived.  He was courageous and innovative and brilliant, his brilliance serving his part well and making up for his lack of schooling.  <br>
Damn these people.  They have already gone after the Robert E Lee Elementary schools and the Stonewall Jackson High Schools.  Now they dishonor a brilliant general for what they think they know about a post war organization he led.</p>

		<p> If Mississippi is in as dire financial straits as most of the 50 states are right now, it had better not start getting persnickity about the vanity plates it approves, if each one is going to bring in $30 to $50 in much-needed revenue. Forrest was a great general; and in wartime, generals sometimes have to do things they might prefer not to have to. Besides, there is some question as to whether the Northern horror stories about the Fort Pillow &#8220;massacre&#8221; are entirely true, partially true, or mostly Union propaganda.</p>
<p> And no organization, the NAACP or anyone else, should have an automatic veto over a particular plate just because it doesn&rsquo;t please all and sundry. Whatever ever happened to freedom of speech?</p>

		<p>Forrest was a great man and way ahead of his time. If the Confederacy had had a dozen more military leaders like him, they would have won the war. No doubt about it. As for honoring him with a license plate, I&rsquo;m all for it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough. Forrest should have his own national holiday. (I also think that William Clarke Quantrill should have a holiday  &mdash;  wouldn&rsquo;t that drive the libs insane?)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a Forrest biography, the best one I&rsquo;ve found so far is &#8220;Nathan Bedford Forrest: In Search Of An Enigma,&#8221; by Eddy W. Davison. Great book. Highly recommended.</p>

		<p>I may be biased because one of my cousins is a descendant of his, but Nathan Bedford Forrest was the only private to work his way up to lieutenant general. The man&rsquo;s military skills were second to none. Had the Confederates had several more leaders like him, they might have won the war</p>

<p>This one sentence encapsulates alot of what is wrong right here!</p>
<p>White Rights are being violated so as to not &#8216;offend&rsquo; someone!  Well there is no Constitutional Right to &#8216;not be offended&rsquo; (at least not yet, but rest assured that Diversitoids are working feverishly to change that!)</p>

		<p>And for what its worth, the Fort Pillow &#8220;massacre&#8221; is another incident, like many in other wars(specifically in WW1&2)that has more versions of it and varied opinions about it that can be legitimately counted! </p>
<p>I once heard a Historian say, how remarkable it was that in war-time we tend to hardly bat an eye at massacres on a grand scale, but suddenly become inexplicably &#8220;outraged&#8221; when they appear on a small scale. In the same way few take even the slightest issue with the dropping of megatons of cluster bombs on top of civilian populations, killing tens of thousands, the same people are inflamed with indignation over the so-called &#8220;massacres&#8221; or &#8220;atrocities&#8221; committed against a very small group of civilians by soldiers. It seems outrage grows uniquely selective in such times. Strange how peoples&rsquo; minds work in the regard. <br>

		<p>If you want to read something that will turn your stomach (and who doesn&rsquo;t), read this thread on the proposal at knoxnews.com, the online location of Knoxville&rsquo;s chief newspaper:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/47gd9ep</p>
<p>I posted this in response to the posts there:</p>
<p>&#8220;I browsed the first 50 posts&hellip;with only an exception or two, the page was a snapshot of a race who has lost all sense of itself, and eagerly awaits its own extinction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing spectacle really. You can be certain that the folks who brought you to this point are incredibly pleased with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That site has worn me out. I urge anyone who wants to waste their time to register there and tell the fools what fools they are.</p>

<p>    General Forrest was always considered a hero in the Deep South and still is among many traditional Southerners. War is not pretty and the War Between the States was a brutal conflict on both sides. What&rsquo;s wrong with a license plate honoring Forrest? If I lived in Mississippi, I&rsquo;d buy one. </p>

<p>&gt; As much as I wish the above were true, it just isn&rsquo;t.  The South had better generals all around, but that is not what led to defeat. What led to defeat was what Margaret Mitchell intimated when her character Rhett Butler says that the lack of industry in the South will &#8220;make a great deal of difference to many gentlemen.&#8221;  That and an unbroken naval blockade did it.</p>
<p> &#8220;No doubt about it. As for honoring him with a license plate, I&rsquo;m all for it, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough. Forrest should have his own national holiday. (I also think that William Clarke Quantrill should have a holiday &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t that drive the libs insane?)&#8221;</p>
<p>And on Quantrill, why not just go for a national &#8220;Jesse James Day?&#8221;  Let&rsquo;s not be silly.  Only holidays like that would be possible in an all white society, and even then, bank robbers are not desirable national heroes, whatever the cause, unless anarchy is the point.  </p>

<p>Forrest was in charge of the Confederate troops, but DID NOT instigate the massacre and took measures to stop it. So I understand from my reading.</p>
<p>Forrest is more associated with TN. anyhow?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; state NAACP president Derrick Johnson said when he was told about the Forrest plate. &ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You realize that you sound like a teenage girl, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Johnson?  Now that I think about it, I believe &#8220;Seriously?  Wow.&#8221; is what one of the cast members of Jersey Shore (Sammi, I believe) says whenever her boyfriend yells or cheats on her.</p>

<p>For a black Democratic politician, Rep. Bailey is refreshingly reasonable on this issue.</p>

		<p>If it comes out, I will own one.<br>
Not because forest was a great soldier.<br>
Not because he represents &#8220;black oppression&#8221; to the blacks.<br>
Not because I want to &#8220;show my heritage&#8221;.<br>
Not because I believe that the &#8220;south should have won&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a southerner in the present, I care nothing of slavery, civil war, what the north or the south did in the mid 1860&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I am only worried about being taxed to death,<br>
Being violently attacked,<br>
My daughter or wife raped,<br>
The influence of racial trash on my children,<br>
And eventually being controlled politically by liberals and the other races that think that I owe them something.</p>
<p>I am extremely well armed and self sufficient. <br>
I do not take government hand outs. I never have and never will.<br>
I will not give up my dignity or integrity to no one. Especially to our current government, especially not for money.</p>
<p>I am a Christian. Forgiving your enemies does not mean for a man to accept being financially or morally raped by a society who hates you.</p>
<p>And the reason I would own one?<br>
Simply to watch these idiots face turn purple and their blood boil over a stupid car tag.</p>
