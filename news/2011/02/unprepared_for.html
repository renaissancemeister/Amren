<h1><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/griego/ci_17408403">Unprepared for Students&rsquo; Learning Gap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tina Griego, Denver Post, February 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The state Commission on Higher Education this month released its latest data on the still-pressing, ever-pressing problem of too many Colorado high school graduates entering college unable to do the regular coursework. Nearly a third of the Class of 2009 had to take at least one remedial class in math, writing or reading upon starting college that fall.</p>
<p>Four of the five traditional high schools with the highest percentage of students in need of remediation are in Denver. The other was Aurora Central. The Denver high schools were, in order of highest remediation needs: West, Abraham Lincoln, North and Montbello. In other words, basically the same schools that have been sending students to college unprepared for years now. And, no, this is not about bashing teachers, so you can put down the phone.</p>
<p>I just want to break this data down a bit. Any discussion of remediation requires it, and nothing is as sobering as seeing how the pieces lay out. </p>
<p>Nearly 91 percent of West High&rsquo;s Class of 2009 entering a Colorado college that fall needed remediation. Nine of 10.</p>
<p>Wait. It gets worse.</p>
<p>West&rsquo;s Class of 2009 had a 47 percent graduation rate. That is, of the 260 freshmen who entered the school in the fall of 2005, 122 students graduated four years later. Add to that group the students who entered West along the way or who took five years to graduate and the Class of 2009 ended up with 165 graduates.</p>
<p>Of those 165, 43 enrolled in a Colorado college or university in the fall of 2009.</p>
<p>Of those, 39  &mdash;  the 91 percent  &mdash;  needed remedial classes. Nearly all needed help in every core subject: math, writing and reading.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way: Of the 2009 West college-bound graduates who enrolled in-state that fall, four were ready for college-level work. </p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t an off-year for West. The percentage of its graduates needing remedial classes has been higher than any other Colorado high school for at least three years. It&rsquo;s easy to single out West, but Lincoln, North and Montbello all have dismal graduation and remediation rates.</p>
<p>All are high-poverty schools where minorities are the majority.</p>

		<p>All those schools were white schools 30 years ago with high test scores and good college preparation.  That was before social justice and school busing, but I digress&hellip;</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, ALL teachers routinely give 4th grade work to our minority-majority &#8216;high school&rsquo; crowd because any harder than that and the 50% of the &#8216;kids&rsquo; who actually will do some or all of the work shut down, like the other 50% who do little of anything but gangbang, laugh or listen to their ipods.</p>
<p>What can we do?  Any teachers who (seriously) spout off about &#8216;standards&rsquo; and we need to &#8216;hold them accountable&rsquo; (to traditional measures) get on the &#8216;bad list&rsquo; of admins who are angry so many &#8216;kids&rsquo; are &#8216;being failed&rsquo; in that class.  (It&rsquo;s couched in terms of you, the teacher, &#8216;failing&rsquo; them, not that the students failed themselves due to lack of work or low quality.)</p>
<p>I have seen many, many a teacher like that railroaded out with &#8220;U&#8221; ratings and harassment.  Even if you can hold out for a while and give the kids grades as they deserve, you realize that you are holding them to &#8216;white&rsquo; american standards that a lot of them have not been properly versed in.</p>
<p>By the time you get them, at age 16, 17, 18 and beyond, there is little you can do, as we all are made to operate under the fiction that &#8216;everyone can learn&rsquo; to the same level, at the same pace and the same material.</p>
<p>We teachers know what our students need.  This one needs reading help.  That one needs to learn how to spell.  That one is ready for a higher level of work, but the social justice philosophy says that they all must be grouped to gether in the same room, regardless of ability level, and the chaos ensues.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Differentiation&#8221; is such a band-aid solution and nearly always does little beyond provide a framework for 4th grade posterboard projects, little group activities and simplistic exercises.  </p>
<p>They even put in FELONS, bornerline retarded, emotionally disturbed and kids who can barely hold a pencil into &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; classes.  Superman cannot save something that is already wrecked.  Ah, but the fiction marches on&hellip;and it is all whitey&rsquo;s fault!</p>

		<p>Good grief. Is Colorado really that bad off? I was under the impression that a significant majority of the population of that state was white.</p>
<p>Why the hell does this get blamed on whites? Low-income whites and NE Asians don&rsquo;t do this badly, so it can hardly be blamed on &#8220;poverty&#8221; (which, given the wide variety of benefits blacks and NWHs qualify for, is an increasingly unlikely explanation).  It boils my blood to see this formerly great country flushed down the tubes by the people who claim that &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;At all events, the discussion of future grave but, with effort now, avoidable evils is the most unpopular and at the same time the most necessary occupation for the politician. Those who knowingly shirk it deserve, and not infrequently receive, the curses of those who come after. &#8220;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to know which specific &#8220;programs&#8221; brought this type of demographic to Colorado.  Think of the farmers, the cattlemen, the welders, and the clergy; the merchants, the doctors, and the schoolmasters, who made the American West a proud yet civilized frontier.  Now we read of wolfpacks assaulting whites in downtown Denver,  of serial and inter-generational belligerent retardation that will surely destroy our society, if it hasn&rsquo;t already.  All of this is embraced  &mdash;  even cherished  &mdash;  by the Left&hellip;We have no power but for the power to vote, and the power to attempt to keep our jobs so that we do not become co-dependents of the Government.</p>

<p>So, then&hellip;  Why were they admitted to these &#8220;Colorado Colleges&#8221; in the first place?  Could it possibly be that the &#8220;Colorado Colleges&#8221; value lots and lots of shiny black faces over actual ability to do course work?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Let me put it this way: Of the 2009 West college-bound graduates who enrolled in-state that fall, four were ready for college-level work.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>A whole four?  Sounds like progress to me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, were even those four truly &#8220;ready for college-level work?&#8221; Or were they just the uppermost level of the others who raised the Diversity points of &#8220;Colorado Colleges?&#8221;  </p>
<p>I wonder what the dropout rate among even those four will be. But I doubt that it&rsquo;ll be something we&rsquo;ll be finding out about in the controlled governmedia any time soon.<br>

		<p>I think the figures from Denver&rsquo;s high schools are echoed in just about every city&rsquo;s public high schools around the country, where minorities are the majority.  It&rsquo;s priorities, one more time.  If parents put a high priority on education, study, learning English, and on good behavioral standards, their kids are going to be successful unless their peers drag them down.  Usually parents who have such standards home school their kids, or put them in private schools.  But, kids today are allowed to get away with murder, sometimes literally, and without discipline and high expectations you get the results as listed here.  Personally, I think that any kid who needs remedial classes in college should not be in any college, and I think that colleges should eliminate remedial classes altogether.  Let these kids go find vocational schools for their post high school education, and get out in the workplace ASAP.  They don&rsquo;t belong in college if they can&rsquo;t cut the college level classes.</p>

		<p>I think the time has come to face the fact that the liberals, who run America&rsquo;s schools, have no commitment to education. Rather the liberals use schools to advance their agenda. People, irrespective of race, who have I.Q.s below ~85 should be given basic education followed by vocational training.  Disruptive students should be isolated, and expelled when they were 16. This is the way it was before the liberals took over, and it worked. The Liberals deliberately changed these policies to the ones currently in place for schooling American children.</p>

		<p>Being that Denver is a very liberal city, I&rsquo;m certain that there is a lot of handwringing going on right now, trying in earnest to figure out why the numbers are so skewed.  We are all intellectually equal, you know.</p>

		<p>We often hear that public schools should raise standards and reduce the dropout rate. Raising standards and reducing the dropout rate is like cutting taxes and balancing the budget. It cannot be done.<br>
 <br>
When standards are raised many students discover that they lack the ability or the self discipline to meet those standards. Therefore they drop out. <br>
 <br>
A school with a large black and Hispanic student body should take pride in a high dropout rate. It means standards are not being compromised. </p>

		<p>There is a bigger implication here. We see more low-IQ people reproduce, and reproduce at younger ages. High-IQ people reproduce at lower rates and later in life. So the low-IQ sector swamps the high-IQ.  </p>
<p>Look at some of the symptoms: increasingly dumbed down populace; decline in math and sciences (programs dropped to accommodate remedial programs); reliance on foreigners for technological advances/IT;  obsession with pop culture instead of classics; deteriorating civic virtues; inability see cause and effect (the debt crisis across the board); inter-generational dysfunction (as negative values and/or genes are passed on).</p>
<p>Consider the end of the American manned space program. Americans no longer have the vision, as well as the engineering get-go, to advance into space. The US putting men on the Moon four decades ago is rapidly slipping into the stuff of heroic myth and legend. But then again, look at the demographics, as well as the people who constituted NASA&rsquo;s policies then and now. </p>
<p>Another point to consider is how higher-IQ immigrant groups are relied upon to take up the slack. The USA can take advantage of higher-IQ/educationally disciplined students from East Asia, etc. For a while.  Meantime, the middle class spends their evenings hypnotized by 500 channels of propaganda on the telescreens. </p>
<p>It just may be that American elites want this state of affairs:  you dumb down the populace; play minorities off against Whites; create a demoralized class of quasi-serfs instead of citizens and another class of dependent foreigners; replace a people&rsquo;s vision with welfare state dependency and cheesy entertainment. Same old ruling class games. </p>
<p>Talk about civilizational self-destruction&hellip; </p>

<p>This is Denver we&rsquo;re talking about.  Denver is a &#8220;sanctuary city&#8221;, so yes, Denver really is that bad off.</p>
<p>Driving between Colorado Springs (where we live) and Boulder (where my mother lives), we take highway 470 West through Golden, just to avoid driving through Denver.  Denver sucks.</p>

		<p>This story is about more than genetics at work, it is about the results of so called outcome based education. You put 30 people in a classroom, divide it into two groups, those with average to above average IQ&rsquo;s, and those with below average IQ&rsquo;s than the group. You force those with any ability to grind their wheels in place teaching concepts to those without the ability to grasp them the first time through. When, and only when every single kid in the group gets the concept (or is pushed/cheated through), and can demonstrate it (usually by group project) do they move on to the next concept in the course. 12 years of this later, and you have kids who are stunted in their educational development being the mean. Even the kids that would have been segregated into gifted programs 20 years ago are often in need of remedial course work because they spend their time having to teach other students rather than learning more advanced material. </p>
<p>This is based on my experiences with outcome based education in schools that are primarily white, so I can only imagine how much worse it is with one more standard deviation downward in IQ being applied. </p>
