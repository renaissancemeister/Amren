				China Builds Its African Empire While the &#8216;Anti-Colonialist&rsquo; Left Looks the Other Way
			</h1>
			<p>
				Damian Thompson, Telegraph (London), November 25, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Since China is not a white country, it can be imperialist without penalty.
			</div>
			
				<p>
					Imagine what would happen if America barged its way into a developing country, buttered up its homicidal dictator and agreed a back-of-the-envelope deal in which he signed over his nation&rsquo;s mineral wealth in return for roads, railways and sports stadiums. Everyone would benefit, no?
				</p>
				<p>
					No. The problem is that the infrastructure turns out to be worth a hell of a lot less than the minerals. Fortunately, Washington has had the foresight to top up the dictator&rsquo;s Swiss bank account. Problem solved! As for the mining operation, the Americans really don&rsquo;t want to be bothered by minimum wages or trade unions. They&rsquo;re banned. And no complaints from the workforce, please, because no one wants a repeat of that &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; in which an American mine supervisor opened fire on stroppy employees.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the United States embarked on this sort of colonial experiment, it would produce a furious &#8220;Occupy Grosvenor Square&#8221; camp outside the US embassy and a withering play by Sir David Hare at the National. But since these things are actually being done not by America but by the People&rsquo;s Republic of China across the entire African continent, the &#8220;anti-colonialist&#8221; Left just yawns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ordinary Africans care, of course. The subject of China will loom large in Monday&rsquo;s election in Congo, though since President Joseph Kabila has arranged to be re-elected, it won&rsquo;t affect the result. It was Kabila who approved a $6 billion copper-for-infrastructure barter deal with China. Unfortunately, the sale of state mines has left Congo with a $5.5 billion black hole in its budget. Meanwhile, The Economist reports: &#8220;The sale of mining licences at below-market value to firms associated with friends of the president has raised eyebrows.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					I can&rsquo;t say it raised my eyebrows. How else do you think China does business in Africa? It suffered a setback in Zambia last year when President Michael Sata was elected on an anti-Chinese ticket. But Sata hasn&rsquo;t fulfilled his promise to regulate Zambia&rsquo;s Chinese-run copper mines, branded &#8220;dangerously unsafe&#8221; by Human Rights Watch. And this week none other than ex-president Dr Kenneth Kaunda was in Beijing&rsquo;s Great Hall of the People to discuss &#8220;deepening substantial co-operation.&#8221;
				</p>
				<p>
					There&rsquo;s a school of thought which says that China&rsquo;s modus operandi, however brutal, at least gets things built. In contrast, Western aid is tipped into dictators&rsquo; pockets without anything to show for it. But the benefits of Beijing&rsquo;s &#8220;investment&#8221; are elusive, because the Chinese don&rsquo;t usually employ Africans to perform anything but menial tasks. Chinese construction engineers build motorways and hospitals without passing on the skills to maintain them. The result: everything falls into disrepair within a decade, by which time the copper is safely out of the ground.
				</p>
				<p>
					From a moral point of view, China&rsquo;s policy towards Africa is despicable. But it&rsquo;s ingenious, too. Beijing has worked out that, by virtue of being a non-Western power, it can pose as a &#8220;developing country&#8221; while creating its sub-Saharan satrapies. The anti-racism lobby in the United Nations makes sure that the finger of guilt is pointed firmly at the former colonial powers, who are always happy to put on a display of breast-beating by, say, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile, something close to slavery is being quietly reintroduced to the dark continent (which is how China thinks of it).
				</p>
				<p>
					For 50 years, it&rsquo;s been unclear in which direction Africans were heading. Now the question is almost irrelevant: the decision has been made for them.
