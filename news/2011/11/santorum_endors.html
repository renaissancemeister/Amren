<h1><a href="https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/23/santorum-endorses-profiling-muslims/">Santorum Endorses Profiling Muslims</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Merica, CNN, November 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum said at Tuesday&rsquo;s CNN National Security Debate that he would improve airport security by profiling, particularly Muslims and young men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously Muslims would be someone you&rsquo;d look at, absolutely,&#8221; Santorum said. &#8220;Those are the folks who &hellip; the radical Muslims are the people that are committing these crimes by and large, as well as younger males.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santorum said profiling was important because the American security apparatus should strive to &#8220;find the bomber, not the bomb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presidential contender Herman Cain said Santorum&rsquo;s support of profiling was &#8220;oversimplifying it.&#8221; He did, though, support &#8220;targeted identification.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do targeted identification,&#8221; Cain said. &#8220;If you take a look at the people who are trying to kill us, it would be easy to figure out exactly what that identification profile looks like.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Even if Cain doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be the &#8216;uncle Tom&rsquo; that Black extremists paint him as, a failed presidency may wake up White conservatives although a Latino is likely to be next in line for the GOP and the Dems once their respective Black leaders screw up. Then Brown Caucasoids like Bobby Jindal and possibly a Cenk Uygur-type for both parties respectively. In 20 years we may see a White candidate again if Whites de-polarize under the strain of being increasingly marginalized.</p>

		<p>Santorum and Cain are just all talk. They know nothing of the kind will be done, so they can always say, &#8220;well, we tried&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>How about Newt condoning amnesty for illegals and that we need to be &#8220;humane&#8221; in our policies towards these &#8220;people&#8221;?</p>
<p> EVERY single White politician in this country will never do a darn thing to stop nonwhite immigration, legal or illegal, or to defend the White race and America as it was meant to be. </p>

		<p>Yes, of course these Neocon-men endorse such policies. They would, however, hysterically denounce any plan to endorse the &#8220;racial-profiling&#8221; of Blacks, for instance, who are the REAL criminal threat in America. Let&rsquo;s not fall for this transparent foolishness. </p>
<p>In fact, there are a fair number of Muslims who live in my area. They are responsible for NONE of the crime here(nor are they &#8220;radical&#8221; people on any level). Blacks and Hispanics, however, are responsible for some 95% of it! What have to you to say about THAT, Santorum?!</p>

<p>Exactly.  Anyone who advocates harsher treatment of Muslims, but not of blacks, who cause far more crime and other problems, is a fool.  </p>

		<p>Most of us practice race profiling in our personal lives. We know which neighborhoods to avoid, especially after dark. We know when it is a good idea to cross the street, change direction, or go back inside and lock the door. <br>
 <br>
This is what Jesse Jackson said about race profiling:&#8221;There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery. Then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.&#8221;<br>

HH,<br>
You won&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re radical until the call is given. Islam promotes lying to the &#8220;infidel&#8221; and telling him whatever he wants to hear until the time is right. Trust me on this. Americans feel better even when they suspect that they&rsquo;re being deceived as long as they hear what they seek. I remember Sean Hannity when interviewing a Muslim radical badgered him into saying the he did&rsquo;t support terror. Hannity ate it up like candy. It was so sad.</p>

		<p>According to Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s new book, nearly 50 percent of homicides are committed by blacks. </p>
<p>12 percent of the population committing nearly half of all homicides? Does that not cry out for profiling?</p>
<p>Then consider that black males commit nearly all the homicides. That&rsquo;s 6 percent of the US population. </p>
<p>Add the fact that 40% of black males   &mdash;   ages 18-49   &mdash;   commit nearly all the homicides. That&rsquo;s about 2.5 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Young black males, 2.5 percent of the nation&rsquo;s population, commit nearly 50 percent of all homicides. </p>
<p>• How many lives would be saved each year if police were to actively pursue racial profiling?</p>
<p>• If it is &#8216;unfair&rsquo; to profile young black males who are most likely to commit violent crimes, is it not also unfair to investigate the other 97.5 percent who are least likely to commit violent crimes?</p>

		<p>Unless we want to live FOREVER is a state where terrorist attacks are commonplace and our daughters, wives are subject to rape, and our property targeted for destruction, we should go beyond profiling and restrict immigration as it was in 1965 before America became the dumping ground for all. </p>
<p>Islam since it will never assimilate but has the notion of replacing our rule of law with sharia should be sent packing and never allowed in country for any reason. </p>
<p>Of course, we would not have allowed Japanese and Nazis in country during WWII, but Muslims walk freely amoung us with murder and mayhem in their hearts. Lets start acting like we want to preserve our way of life.</p>
