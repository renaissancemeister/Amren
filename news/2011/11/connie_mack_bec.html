			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Boyle, Daily Caller, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder&rsquo;s service in the Obama administration may be coming to an end. Thirty members of Congress are now calling for Holder&rsquo;s immediate resignation  &mdash;  a number that grows larger every day.</p>
<p>Florida Republican Rep. Connie Mack became the latest congressman to demand that Holder step down, telling The Daily Caller late on Tuesday that &#8220;Eric Holder should resign Fast and Furiously!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Congresswoman Bono Mack is deeply concerned about &#8216;Fast and Furious&rsquo; and certainly a resignation is not out of the question,&#8221; her spokesman Cort Bush told TheDC earlier this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s continued failure to defend Holder suggests that the president may be keeping the door open to pushing Holder out of office to prevent the scandal from seeping into campaign season.</p>
<p>Three presidential candidates  &mdash;  Rep. Michele Bachmann, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney  &mdash;  have made, in one form or another, a call for Holder&rsquo;s resignation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The continued congressional pressure on Holder comes as the Attorney General&rsquo;s top deputy, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday. At the hearing, ranking Republican member Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa pushed Breuer on his recent claims that he was responsible  &mdash;  at least partially  &mdash;  for not informing Holder that gun walking tactics were used during the Operation Fast and Furious.</p>
<p>Gun-walking is when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allows straw purchasers to take guns across the border without stopping them, even when law enforcement agents have the chance to do so. Straw purchasers are people who can legally purchase weapons in the United States but do so with the known intention of trafficking them into Mexico.</p>
<p>In a late Monday night document dump that appears to have been an attempt to shield Holder from more public pressure, Breuer admitted that he knew gun-walking occurred during Operation Wide Receiver  &mdash;  a Bush administration program from 2006 and 2007 that employed similar, but more subtle tactics.</p>
<p>Grassley pressured Breuer into admitting that a statement in a letter the DOJ sent him on Feb. 4, 2011, was not true. &#8220;ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico,&#8221; the letter from the DOJ to Grassley said.</p>
<p>After reading it aloud during the hearing, Grassley turned to Breuer and said: &#8220;That statement is absolutely false and you admitted as much last night that you knew by April of 2010 that ATF walked guns in Operation Fast and Furious. That&rsquo;s correct, yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, senator,&#8221; Breuer replied.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During that same hearing, Breuer and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein tried to blame what they consider lax gun laws for Operation Fast and Furious&rsquo; failures, even though it was the law enforcement agents responsible for enforcing gun laws who were selling guns to Mexican drug cartels. {snip}</p>

		<p>I have been doing a fair amount of thinking about Fast &amp; Furious lately.  One of the rarely reported facts about F&F; is that it started under Bush.</p>
<p>Putting all the pieces together, here&rsquo;s what I think:</p>
<p>Bush starts F&F; to let &#8220;straw purchased&#8221; guns &#8220;walk&#8221; into Mexico, in order to sandbag immigration politics, because Bush wants amnesty and open borders.  Obama inherits F&F; from Bush, keeps the immigration motivation, he wants amnesty and open borders, too, but not only expands F&F; in terms of operations (actually giving the guns directly to the known Mexican gang bangers), but also the motivation (sandbagging 2nd Amendment politics).</p>

		<p>Even if Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder is forced to resign it won&rsquo;t make any difference to &#8220;us&#8221;. Does anyone really think that Obama will replace him with somebody thats racially fair and balanced? No, Obama will replace him with someone that will make Holder look like J. Edgar Hoover!</p>

		<p>This is NOT a situation where we just allow the Attorney General to resign.  This is precisely what criminal prosecution and disbarment is for.  Heads should roll, people should be prosecuted, and a severe punishment should be meted out to those who are complicit in the murder of American citizens.  </p>

		<p>This has always been about creating a crisis to pass more gun control legislation  on law abiding American gun owners.  F &amp; F was neither a failure nor &#8220;botched&#8221;, it was uncovered, but only after the unfortunate murder of Border Agent Brian Terry.</p>
<p>Special Agent John Dodson of the Phoenix Field Division said on June 1: <i>Allowing loads of weapons that we knew to be destined for criminals, this was the plan. It was so mandated.</i></p>
<p><i>Breuer&hellip; claims that he was responsible &mdash; at least partially &mdash; for not informing Holder that gun walking tactics were used during the Operation Fast and Furious.</i></p>
<p>Looks like the racist, lying Holder is still trying to cover up, stall and lie to protect himself.  Everything from Bush to the Second Amendment to law abiding gun shop owners are being blamed for this travesty.  Holder should be tried for treason and murder, sentenced to LWOP in a military prison, because that&rsquo;s exactly what this is, treason and murder.</p>
<p><i> Although Breuer claims he personally never told Holder about the tactics being used in Fast and Furious, five detailed memos about the lethal program dated July and August 2010 were addressed directly to Holder.</i> </p>
<p>Wonder what Breuer was offered to fall on his sword. </p>
<p>Breuer, acting in his assigned roll of fall guy and useful idiot, testified yesterday  that <i>nearly 70 percent of guns found in Mexico come from the United States   &mdash;      a figure that has been disproven by the National Rifle Association, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and by Senator Charles Grassley&rsquo;s office multiple times.</i></p>
<p><i>Also during testimony, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein pushed for more gun control [stating that] American gun laws are too lax therefore resulting in more violent crime. &#8216;The problem is, anybody can walk in [to a gun shop] and buy anything,&rsquo; Feinstein said.</i></p>
<p>Lying Hypocrite!  How about asking the law abiding gun shop owners who are being blamed and scapgoated by you and other lying, traitorous pols.</p>
<p><i>Law abiding gun shop owners expressed deep discomfort with selling massive amounts of high powered weapons to known drug cartel straw purchasers, yet ATF officials told them to do so anyway, saying they would be &#8216;serving their country&rsquo; by helping the ATF in the operation. Several gun shops wanted to stop the questionable sales, but ATF agents encouraged them to continue.</i> </p>
<p>The American people and murdered Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry&rsquo;s family deserve justice for this murderous operation.</p>
<p>Kent, Brian&rsquo;s brother, stated:  &#8220;He&rsquo;d want them to tell the truth. That&rsquo;s one thing my brother didn&rsquo;t like was a liar. And that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d want. He&rsquo;d want the truth. He was my only brother. That was the only brother I had. I&rsquo;m lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope justice is served and punishment meted out, the Terry family and American people deserve nothing less.</p>

		<p>No2. You sound like you belong to this administration. Believe you me if Bush had anything to do with this Obama would have shouted it from the roof of the white house! The Bush administration had something like this called wide receiver where a small number of guns were moved with a homing device that didn&rsquo;t work for very long because of a small battery. Wide receiver was ended quickly. These ppl in this administration did this to push a gun control agenda. Read how diane Weinstein has tried to turn this into a gun control issue. </p>

		<p>7 Mike in Cleveland:</p>
<p>Me, an Obamaite?  You&rsquo;re kidding, right?  I just looked at the calendar, and it&rsquo;s nowhere near April 1.</p>
<p>First, could you give me some corroboration about the F&F; style program under Bush being as innocuous as you say?  My reaction to that is that I&rsquo;m a little relieved, but still, Bush was open borders and amnesty all the way.  No President would have to worry about clever ways to gather evidence against Mexican drug gangsters if they weren&rsquo;t in the United States to begin with.</p>
<p>Second, Democrat apologist for Obama ARE trying to shout about F&F; started under Bush.</p>
<p>Third, I agree that sandbagging 2nd Amendment politics is the goal of this White House.  I&rsquo;m saying that they&rsquo;re also trying to affect the immigration debate.  Both Obama and Bush.</p>
<p>As an aside, this news just broke:</p>

<p><i>One of the rarely reported facts about F&F; is that it started under Bush.</i></p>
<p>Fast and Furious did not start under Bush.  It was initiated in 2009 after Bush was long out of office.</p>
<p>Operation Wide Receiver took place during the Bush administration, 2006-2007, as stated in the article above.  Under OWR, there was an effort to track 300 weapons in collaboration with the Mexican government.  Under F&F;, there was no effort to track 2,500 guns that were purposely walked into Mexico, without the knowledge of the Mexican government.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t recall Bush blabbering all over the place that 90 percent of the guns the Mexican drug cartels use come from the United States.</p>

		<p>No 10 deal I guess I thought you were uninformed. That article is more proof holder knew. The Bush administration wanted Mexican help,In Obama&rsquo;s administration no one in Mexico knew. The Mexicans have said so. That article reflects the attitude of Obama and his crew. Holder lied Obama probably knew just as much. Proving it is another matter.</p>

<p>Why would he?  NRA money and voters are too important to the Republican Party.  Bush&rsquo;s motivation for Operation Wide Receiver (as you informed me) I think was to affect immigration politics.  Obama likes F&F; for the same reason.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t follow your logic about OWR, F&F; and immigration policy.  I have read extensively about this fiasco and at no time have I read one word about F&F; as a ploy to affect immigration policy.  However, I&rsquo;m all ears and willing to listen to your theory.</p>
<p>F&F; was an obvious effort to undermine the second amendment, to &#8220;prove right&#8221; Obama and H. Clinton&rsquo;s contention that &#8220;90% of the guns used by Mexican drug cartels were coming from the United States&#8221; and (according to Sen. Fineswine) that &#8220;anyone can walk into a gun store and buy anything, 50-caliber weapons, sniper weapons, buy them in large amounts, and send them down to Mexico.&#8221; because of &#8220;lax American gun laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did Obama not tell Sara Brady that he was working on gun control &#8220;under the radar?&#8221;</p>
<p><i>She has been carrying a loaded weapon since 1968.</i></p>
<p>Fineswine made this statement about her own CCW:</p>
<p><i>I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight.</i></p>
<p><i>I possessed a concealed weapon permit for a short time beginning in 1976. In the mid‑1970s, a terrorist organization ‑‑ the New World Liberation Front ‑‑ carried out two attacks against me and my family.</i> </p>
<p><i>Later, some of the members of the New World Liberation Front were arrested, and the threat abated. At that point, I had the gun   &mdash;   and several other weapons that were turned into the police   &mdash;   melted into a cross, which I presented to Pope John Paul II when I visited Rome in 1982. Currently, I do not possess a gun, nor do I have a permit to carry a concealed weapon.</i></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believe one word this hypocrite says.  Then again, why would she need a concealed weapon?  She is surrounded by armed security at all times and lives in a fortified home.</p>
<p><i>NRA money and voters are too important to the Republican Party</i></p>
<p>The NRA has sold out its member on a number of fronts including the Disclose Act. A better organization is the National Association for Gun Rights @  www.nationalgunrights.org.</p>

<p>It would go something like this:  But for F&F; being broken wide open, I could hear Barack Obama saying something to this effect right now:  &#8220;How can you bigots oppose comprehensive immigration reform because of Mexican crime when it&rsquo;s your guns causing Mexican crime?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could even hear Bush saying it, if it was only the Wide Receiver program that was ever implemented.</p>
<p><i>The NRA has sold out its member on a number of fronts including the Disclose Act.</i></p>
<p>NRA is basically the lobbying arm for the domestic small arms industry.  They have members, and millions of them, but members&rsquo; dues are irrelevant to NRA finances.  The NRA is most concerned about the needs and the public relations of the industry, not 2nd Amendment politics and theory per se.</p>
