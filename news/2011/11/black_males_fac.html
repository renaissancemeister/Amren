<h1>Black Males Face Tougher Odds in School</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sherri Ackerman, Tampa Bay Online, November 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At 14, Shawn Turner-McGee is a convicted felon, arrested last spring for pushing his teacher and grabbing her arms.</p>
<p>He said it was a misunderstanding, one that he wrote a written apology for and served probation.</p>
<p>Last month, Greco Middle School officials suspended the seventh-grader twice for shoving and provoking another boy in the hall.</p>
<p>On Thursday, during his first week back on campus, Shawn was in trouble again following another scuffle and school lockdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want him to be labeled a bad kid,&#8221; said his mother, Christy Turner. &#8220;I want him to get his education.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t be easy. Shawn and other black males are among the most at-risk students in the district and the nation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And while the gap in graduation rates between black males and boys of other races may be narrowing, it&rsquo;s still an issue that leads to future consequences.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only 47 percent of America&rsquo;s black males graduate high school, according to a 2010 report by the Schott Foundation, a Cambridge, Mass.-based organization that funds programs to help public schools.</p>
<p>In Florida, state Department of Education records show that 61 percent of black male students graduated high school in 2008.</p>
<p>That number rose two years later to 68 percent with 75 percent of black males in Hillsborough graduating with classmates who started high school the same year.</p>
<p>Compare that to 88 percent of white males matriculating in the county, and it shows the gap between black and white male students is closing, education leaders say.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Black males are twice as likely in Florida to face suspensions or expulsions than white and Hispanic males, a Tampa Tribune analysis found.</p>
<p>In Hillsborough, black males are three times more likely to be suspended from school than white males and five times more likely to be expelled.</p>
<p>A 2010 study by the civil rights advocate Southern Policy Law Center blames zero-tolerance disciplinary policies for the high rates.</p>
<p>Despite two decades of the practice, the policies don&rsquo;t necessarily improve safety or learning, the law center said.</p>
<p>In Hillsborough, which has zero tolerance for incidents like violence against teachers or bringing weapons to school, officials recognize the high rate of suspensions is a problem.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that last sentence just a hoot.  Violence against teachers and bringing weapons to schools results in suspensions, but the high rate of suspension is the problem.  No.</p>
<p>Blacks are the problem.  They are way out of control.  Threaten a teacher or bring a weapon to school (one assumes concealed until brandished, which is (or ought to be) a felony.  don&rsquo;t suspend them.  Kick them out of school permanently, and send their sorry selves to adult prison.  These behaviors are just precursors to worse behavior on the street.  </p>

		<p>This pattern existed prior to &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221;.  Keep in mind that &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; is not referring to any infraction, but infractions of violence.  Go to the second paragraph and not that after assaulting a teacher, the offender called that a &#8220;misunderrstanding&#8221;.  These are damaged kids that disrupt and detract those that can apply themselves to their studies.  Further, they cause fear and actual harm.  This is far more than &#8220;tougher odds&#8221;.</p>

		<p>About half way thru those escapades the first kid did, I would have been out of school and sent to where they sent the disruptive and retarded kids when I was a junior high student.</p>
<p>The name of the school I would&rsquo;ve been sent to was:</p>
<p>Hopewell School&hellip;seriously</p>
<p>Or some adult would have straightened me out much earlier&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  I remember in Jr high you could hear them giving &#8220;licks&#8221; to someone out in the hall.  After about the 3rd &#8220;lick&#8221; the tough kid would be crying and begging for another chance.  </p>

		<p>Sounds like Shawn Turner-McGee is a prime candidate for a Special Education &#8220;Emotional Support&#8221; class. God knows, there are enough hare-brained judges out there who will bang their gavels and declare, &#8220;This boy should be in school. Either he has regular attendance or he&rsquo;ll be placed in a reformatory.&#8221; Well, Thanks a heap, judge! THIS is why Special Ed teachers - who always inherit people like Shawn - now last an average of 11 MONTHS before quitting! And this is why the profession is dying so fast. SPED instructors have somehow been transformed into cops/bouncers/psychotherapists/targets/etc. when the poor fools truly believed that their jobs involved teaching!</p>
<p>Of course, being in Special Ed is a godsend for thugs like Shawn. Just think! Why, he can raise pure hell for his first two weeks, get himself suspended for the 10 day federal limit, and then be untouchable for the rest of the school year! He can burn the damn schoolhouse down, but as a Special Ed student, he won&rsquo;t suffer any consequences. It&rsquo;s a tried-and-true strategy for black miscreants. (Of course, as a SPED kid, he can also stay in high school till his 22nd birthday and start a lucrative career as an arm-breaker or drug dealer to all the 13 and 14 year-olds.) </p>
<p>Naturally, the SPLC and Hillsborough administrators recognize that the high rate of black suspensions is &#8220;a problem&#8221;. So! Maybe they should come here to Philly, where black suspensions are a genuine rarity - and see what a paradise our school system has become as a result. Yes, soon we&rsquo;ll have burgeoning Philadelphias all over the country. And won&rsquo;t that be special?</p>

		<p><i>At 14, Shawn Turner-McGee is a convicted felon, arrested last spring for pushing his teacher and grabbing her arms.</i></p>
<p>And probably arrested for a lot more than that.  It&rsquo;s just that they won&rsquo;t tell us the rest of the story.</p>
<p><i>Last month, Greco Middle School officials suspended the seventh-grader twice for shoving and provoking another boy in the hall.</i></p>
<p>At 14, he should be in eighth grade.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to be labeled a bad kid,&rdquo; said his mother, Christy Turner.</i></p>
<p>Oh, you just don&rsquo;t want him to be <i>labeled</i> a bad kid.  It&rsquo;s perfectly okay for him to be a bad kid, you just have a problem with the rest of the world noticing.</p>
<p><i>And while the gap in graduation rates between black males and boys of other races may be narrowing, it&rsquo;s still an issue that leads to future consequences.</i></p>
<p>Whatever those &#8220;future consequences&#8221; are, they can all be avoided if you adopt my plan of giving every person a high school diploma upon turning 18, whether they have &#8220;earned&#8221; it or not.  All those &#8220;consequences&#8221; will magically disappear.</p>
<p><i>In Hillsborough, black males are three times more likely to be suspended from school than white males and five times more likely to be expelled.  A 2010 study by the civil rights advocate Southern Policy Law Center blames zero-tolerance disciplinary policies for the high rates.  Despite two decades of the practice, the policies don&rsquo;t necessarily improve safety or learning, the law center said.</i></p>
<p>The SPLC has it backwards.  Zero-Tolerance (aka Zero Thought) was enacted so that schools can avoid the accusations of profiling or disparate impact.  ZT means that many more white students and non-black students are suspended for ticky tack offenses and non-offenses, than they otherwise would be.  Without ZT, and restoring the sensible policy of a school district being able to judge each student misconduct case on its own merits, and in context, the race disparity would be even wider.</p>

I turned 15 in the spring of my 9th grade year, and most of my classmates were of similar age&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
so I was 14 the majority of my 9th grade&hellip;&hellip;<br>
as were 98% of the other students<br>
It sounds like the kid is 2 yrs behind his cohort group&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.<br>
which is probably pretty normal for blacks</p>

		<p>The black male retention rate at the local community college here is just above 20%. Having taught a number of &#8220;remedial&#8221; English courses at the community college level over the past few years, I can say that the overwhelming majority of the students who test into remedial classes are black (about 90-95%). Most of them also fail these classes   &mdash;   but not before they have plenty of time to milk the system by collecting Pell Grants.  They also spend the most time in &#8220;computing and tutoring centers&#8221; on campus   &mdash;   listening to rap videos and using &#8220;free&#8221; internet services.    <br>
  &mdash;  <br>
&#8220;At 14, Shawn Turner-McGee is a convicted felon, arrested last spring for pushing his teacher and grabbing her arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>On two specific instances, I personally felt physically threatened by the behavior of students.  Both incidents were reported to administrators. No punishment was ever given to either of these students.  Black students and Black administrators in both cases. </p>
<p>Thankfully, I now teach in a peaceful, private, majority-white school where my students are excelling.</p>

<p>These people will never understand they&rsquo;re responsible for their own action and how people see them and treat them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hopeless.</p>

		<p>Blacks do not want an education. They are majority racist, bigots and violent in the schools. I am a retired Navy man who substitute teaches and every all black class I have had is a nightmare. Total disrespect, and thuggish behavior by all of the blacks, especially the female blacks. In classes with whites the blacks are ALWAYS  the one that cause problems. Black administrators blame teachers and overlook the thuggish behavior and the cycle continues. The black administrators are racist.</p>

		<p>There are so many horror stories about the crimes that black students commit in schools. If you know a teacher or student who lived through forced bussing, you could write a book from their horror stories. I knew a retired teacher from a big city high school. After forced bussing, her life became a nightmare. One of her colleuges, another teacher, about 50 years old, was gang-raped by some black students. That was her final straw and she retired early. </p>
<p>Whites tried to fight forced integration by moving away (white flight), and sending their children to private schools. The blacks and liberals figured out this scheme and instituted section 8 housing, forced bussing to the suburbs, and forced integration of &#8220;gifted&#8221; classes. Even in private schools, liberal administrators have set up &#8220;scholarships&#8221; for &#8220;underprivledged urban youth&#8221;. You pay to have your children bullied and attacked. At this point, there is no longer any passive escape from black criminals. They are attacking our children, and the liberals forbid us to protect our children. We aren&rsquo;t even allowed to move away anymore.  We actually have to physically fight back now. There is no longer any escape. </p>
<p>During the civil rights movement, blacks organized themselves and demonstrated through both peaceful protest and the threat of violence. They aimed to end segregation. They were smaller in number than us and had very little money, yet they were successful. Their stakes were much lower than ours. They were fighting to use the same restrooms, schools, buses, etc. We are larger in numbers and monetary value. We are not fighting about bathrooms and lunchrooms. Our children are being raped and murdered. That is actually a much more urgent situation. Why can&rsquo;t we be successful?  Our rage is boiling over, and the lives of our children are at stake. We need to fight back NOW. </p>

<p>Uh, no. The suspensions are the solution, or at least an attempted solution.

		<p>I would say it is the TEACHERS of black students who are &#8220;at risk&#8221;. They are at risk of being assaulted, or worse. Perhaps much worse. Black students are any teachers&rsquo; nightmare. More then a few of them, and the class is completely disrupted.</p>

 <br>
I blame organizations like the Southern Policy Law Center for the fact that inner city schools are black board jungles. They interfere with the discipline that is necessary. By the time a juvenile delinquent is kicked out of school for the last time his backside should be covered with scars and scabs. <br>
 <br>
What will happen to him once he is out? The same thing that happens eventually anyway. He will end up in prison. The sooner he gets there, the longer he stays, and the more harshly he is treated the better it will be for decent people. <br>
 <br>
The only way to get any value out of low IQ criminals is through prison labor. </p>

		<p>Hillsborough is the county in which I live.  It seems the TBO finally had to acknowledge a problem but with typical MSM and very typical Floridian journalistic language.</p>
<p>Even my more liberal friends agree that Tampa and Hillsborough county now resemble the Third World.  The apartments are uninhabitable for anyone other than minorities and most of the houses are Section 8 so you can guess who lives in those, too.  White flight makes traffic patterns look like Atlanta during rush hour  &mdash;  from the northside in the morning and back to the northside in the evening.</p>
<p>Yet the schools in town are called &#8220;Academies&#8221; and even &#8220;Prep Academies&#8221;.  &#8220;Magnet&#8221; schools are everywhere.  Their students wear uniforms.  But they beat teachers and each other up.  The violence in certain areas of Tampa is shocking, in-your-face, and very frequent.  And it ain&rsquo;t the Italian or Cuban mafia anymore, not that they were ever a good thing.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that the very people who say that race doesn&rsquo;t matter are constantly bringing up just how at-risk blacks are.  See, race does matter to them but only in the sense that one race is always somehow the victim and another is always somehow the villain.</p>

		<p>The story is strangely sympathetic since it mentions the student commiting three different assaults, one against an adult.<br>
Another problem is that 7th graders are 12 years old at the start of the year, this 14 year old is larger and much more muscular than the small children he is around. He is a danger to them.</p>

<p>No, no no! Had very little money? Guess who BUSSED in all the blacks? The ADL/SPLC types bussed them in and even PAID many for their &#8220;needs&#8221;. They encouraged violence, rape etc. They also did NOT &#8220;organize&#8221; themselves. EVERY movement that demonized Whites, especially the White male, and pushed for integration and miscegenation, 3rd world immigration, was instituted and enforced by the same people. Look it up.</p>

		<p>When I was serving as a sub teacher nearly 20 years ago, I overheard the school principal telling another teacher that she [the teacher] must give a certain difficult child a &#8216;social&rsquo; promotion to the next grade because the child in question was simply too physically big to be around the smaller children with that bad temper of his. </p>
<p>He had to weigh nearly 200 pounds; solid muscle, not fat. - and this was in an elementary school, not middle or high school!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no one is willing to be the one to say that the Emperor has no clothes. </p>
<p>Paradoxically, the more we know as a society about race, intelligence, genetics, and heredity, more hysterical the denial of reality comes.</p>
<p>Eventually – and possibly very soon – the genes that allow higher brain development will be identified, and it will be clear that they are simply not present in most individuals of African descent.</p>
<p>How will the government keep this information from penetrating the consciousness of the majority?  </p>
<p>The simple truth is that the scientific community could have crashed the entire regime of race denial years ago.</p>
<p>They are keeping their heads down for fear of persecution, but the tiniest bit of courage on their parts would be enough to bring the whole house of cards tumbling down.</p>
<p>Eventually, this crazy regime of race denial will crash and burn, but the trillion dollar question is:</p>
<p>Will it already be too late to save the European civilizations?</p>

		<p>I am glad the SPLC has expertise in why black boys raise hell in school. As we near the end of 2011, they are about to send out 1.5 million fund raising letters so you can expect a story about Anti-Semitism and the K to appear in every major paper. I would trade Al Qaeda straight up for them at the drop of a hat. At least the Muslim fanatics do it for Almighty Allah, Dees`s boys do it for the almighty dollar.<br>

		<p>This is why re-segregating the schools is key to allowing those students with aptitudes for learning, Whites and Asians, can do so and blacks and latinos can pursue their &#8220;traditional&#8221; roles. Those roles being what they do already in integrated schools: misbehave in all manner of violence and indolence. Since it is in their very nature, genetically, for them to do so, we are &#8220;being oppressive&#8221; by &#8220;forcing&#8221; them to go to a school where these &#8220;natural talents&#8221; are being &#8220;suppressed&#8221;. How unfair of we White Devils. </p>
<p>Some kids would much rather learn better ways of robbing, raping and killing rather than reading, writing and arithmetic. Who are we to prevent them from their racial inclinations? Why must we impose such &#8220;high expectations&#8221; upon them? </p>

No, Mr Anonymous, you do not fight by running away. You fight by standing and fighting. The reason integration and other atrocities keep happening to whites is that they keep running instead of standing and fighting</p>

		<p>&#8221; A 2010 study by the civil rights advocate Southern Policy Law Center blames zero-tolerance disciplinary policies for the high rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have this policy in self-defense. Otherwise they justifiably would still be suspending black trouble makers disproportionally but then the NAACP and Obama&rsquo;s Dept. of Injustice could sue them claiming this proves racial discrimination - as if white students are just as much trouble. This is why the Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s of the con-man world hate this zero-tolerance policy. It&rsquo;s unfair to the whites in a sense of being too harsh but it keeps the enemy of high standards NAACP off the schools back.</p>

		<p>To #28 &hellip; Standing and fighting will get ANY white person locked up for violation of the so-called &#8220;civil rights (for some)&#8221; laws.  Ask any apartment or homeowner who has attempted to restrict rental or purchase of their own kind and has run afoul of the &#8220;equal housing&#8221; and &#8220;anti-discrimination&#8221; laws.  The fines are heavy and the )misplaced and misguided) social ostracization is a heavy toll.<br>
Civil rights (for some) laws and anti discrimination laws confer NO PROTECTION to whites.  Just ask eric holder &hellip;</p>

<p>This ONLY applies to Whites, no other racial group.  Entire apartment buildings in South California are Asian (Korean or Chinese or Pilipino) or Armenian, Persian, etc. and NO ONE EVER SAYS A THING when they rent ONLY others of their OWN ethnic or racial group.  Equal housing and anti-discriminaiton laws are used against Whites and only Whites to make sure that any and ALL White enclaves are eliminated.</p>

<p>There are no trades that do not require basic math and reading skills.  If they cannot learn to measure, how can they be carpenters.  If their spatial relations skills are as low as their IQs they can never be mechanics, plumbers or any other trade.</p>
<p>Black behavior is one of the reasons shop classes have disappeared.  It is just too dangerous to have vicious thugs around machinery and tools.  Even cooking and kitchen work is dangerous because there are knives, stoves and hot oil around.</p>
<p>I doubt there is a trade other than janitor where out of control thugs with IQs below 90 can learn.  Another problem is behavior.  No employer or trades union wants to send rapists, robbers and burglars to residences and businesses where they can prey on the customers.</p>
<p>There is no place for blacks in modern society until they can once more be under control.  Until then, they are just too much trouble.  What contractor wants his customers raped and robbed and face lawsuits because he or she sent a black thug to do remodeling work?<br>

		<p>Growing up, I would never have dreamed of assaulting a teacher or school official. I would have assumed that anyone who did would have faced a VERY long suspension or maybe even dismissal. I went to school in 99% New Hampshire, and I don&rsquo;t recall a single student of a student assaulting a teacher. Does any of these liberal fools think that if a white kid assaulted a teacher they would be simply given an afternoon detention? Of course not, the white student would be given a very long suspension, just like the black student.</p>

		<p>I teach in a school that&rsquo;s only 20 percent white, yet the biggest discipline problems are texting in class or talking when the teacher&rsquo;s talking, and that comes from white students.</p>
<p>My non-white students sit with their hands folded at their desks, diligently take notes, study, and bawl with disappointment if they get an A-.</p>
<p>Guess how that is? All my minority students are Asian; mostly Chinese but also some Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese students. </p>
<p>My job is like a dream come true. I invite all the liberals and all the AR non-white haters to come and observe at an Asian school and see how well behaved and studious Asian teens are.</p>

<p>All fine well and good. Still as a white person, I still find being race-replaced by Orientals and other Asians, however well-behaved, cold comfort. Very cold comfort indeed.</p>
