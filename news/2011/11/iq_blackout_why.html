<h1>IQ Blackout: Why Did Studying Intelligence Become Taboo?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anneli Rufus, AlterNet, November 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Scholars used to avidly study human intelligence. They measured cranial capacity. They administered IQ tests. They sought to define what intelligence was and who had more or less of it and why.</p>
<p>These days, not so much. Somewhere along the way, the very idea of intelligence became politicized. Its legitimacy as a field of study, as a measurable quality  &mdash;  on par with height, eyesight and hand-and-eye coordination  &mdash;  and as a concept came under fire. Talk of &#8220;brainpower&#8221; and &#8220;smarts&#8221; ebbed as scholars proposed &#8220;multiple intelligences&#8221;  &mdash;  such as musical, spatial, interpersonal and intrapersonal  &mdash;  rather than whatever had hitherto been called IQ. An IQ blackout has descended. When researchers talk about IQ at all, the big question is whether it&rsquo;s inherited, and if so, how much. IQ now faces fierce competition from SQ and EQ, social and emotional intelligence, two burgeoning theories.</p>
<p>Why are our minds and their capabilities among the most taboo topics in 21st-century academia?</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe there are a number of factors involved,&#8221; says Dennis Garlick, a postdoctoral researcher in psychology at UCLA and the author of <em>Intelligence and the Brain: Solving the Mystery of Why People Differ in IQ and How a Child Can Be a Genius</em> (Aesop, 2010). &#8220;Certainly a major factor is the race issue. Arguing that the races differ in IQ has tainted the whole field, and many researchers and commentators would prefer to just avoid the area for fear of being labeled racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of that taint and fear dates back to the work of UC Berkeley psychologist Arthur Jensen, whose writings in the 1960s linking differences in cognitive ability with differences in race sparked protests on the Berkeley campus and outrage in the scientific community that echoes to this day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important fact about intelligence is that we can measure it,&#8221; Jensen wrote in his most famous work, &#8220;How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?&#8221; published in the <em><em>Harvard Educational Review</em></em> in 1969.</p>
<p>&#8220;IQ is known to predict scholastic performance better than any other single measurable attribute of the child,&#8221; Jensen wrote.</p>
<p>Asserting that intelligence is &#8220;heritable&#8221;  &mdash;  that it&rsquo;s mainly in our genes  &mdash;  he then warned against making racial generalizations: against, in a sense, being racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we select a person for some special educational purpose &hellip; we are selecting an individual, and we are selecting him and dealing with him for reasons of his individuality&hellip; .   Since, as far as we know, the full range of human talents is represented in all the major races of man and in all socioeconomic levels, it is unjust to allow the mere fact of an individual&rsquo;s racial or social background to affect the treatment accorded to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Schools and society must provide a range and diversity of educational methods, programs, and goals,&#8221; Jensen demanded: In other words, diversify the curricula, not necessarily the faculty or student body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jensen is still greatly respected by many traditional intelligence researchers,&#8221; Garlick says. &#8220;By &#8216;traditional intelligence researchers,&rsquo; I mean researchers who still value IQ and continue to do studies that evaluate the effectiveness of IQ in predicting outcomes, or studies that examine possible mechanisms that may cause differences in IQ. However, due to the unpopularity of Jensen&rsquo;s findings, this group of researchers is now very small.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major move in response to Jensen&rsquo;s findings hasn&rsquo;t been rigorous and compelling research to try and disprove his hypotheses and findings. Rather, it has led to an exodus of researchers away from the area, and a drying up of grant funding and research positions for researchers interested in IQ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jensen&rsquo;s work was a flashpoint dividing the study of human intelligence into two periods: BJ and AJ, you might say.</p>
<p>&#8220;The post-Jensen period has not been filled with good research aimed at disproving and discounting Jensen&rsquo;s hypotheses,&#8221; Garlick laments, &#8220;but rather with treating not just Jensen but the field of IQ in general as persona non grata. What this means for people who are low in intelligence is very much up to debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you believe that IQ measures something genetic, scientifically and precisely measurable, and of paramount importance in life, then it&rsquo;s easy to believe that people who score very low should not be allowed to have children,&#8221; says human-rights lawyer turned journalist Stephen Murdoch, author of <em>IQ: A Smart History of a Failed Idea</em> (Wiley, 2007). {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Other traits, such as conscientiousness or self-control, might be viewed as equally or more important&hellip; .   As long as there is disagreement in the field about what intelligence is, we should remain agnostic and ignore what the intelligence experts say the nature of intelligence is&hellip; .   We listened to the intelligence experts in the 20th century with dire consequences,&#8221; Murdoch says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there are researchers who are still interested in the differences between races. I have no idea why. What&rsquo;s the intellectual appeal or social utility of such studies? It escapes me&hellip; .   I believe in academic freedom: Let them study the issue if they want to. Just ignore them.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The IQ test came into disfavor because blacks do so badly on it.</p>
<p>All the rest is smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>The Nazis euthanized a few thousand retarded people before popular outcry scuttled the program.</p>
<p>Then they went on to exterminate the Jews, who were not retarded, but instead more intellectually gifted on average than the general population.</p>
<p>All of which proves exactly what?</p>
<p>The eugenics movement in the West predated the Nazi regime, and generally resided on the enlightened and progressive side of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>The notion that racial differences in intelligence is a dull, tedious sort of topic (as claimed by one of the interviewees in the article) is a weird, desperate sort of argument:</p>
<p>on the contrary, racial differences in intelligence is by very wide margin the MOST controversial topic in our society.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be perfectly honest:</p>
<p>if all US citizens  – including blacks  – with IQs below 75 had been sterilized over the past century, would the results have been positive for American society, or negative?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one: why don&rsquo;t we just ignore you?  A human rights lawyer turned journalist is bound to be biased based upon emotion rather than fact.  Perhaps he&rsquo;s even more biased than a regular ole MSM journalist, if that&rsquo;s possible.</p>

		<p>Back in the mid 1950&rsquo;s, when I was in college, a Psych prof made a remark which no college professor would dare make today.  He said, &#8220;A brilliant Negro is one with a 100 IQ.&#8221;  At the time, my youthful idealism didn&rsquo;t want to admit that that was true.  The older I get, the more true it seems.</p>

		<p>IQ research became taboo when the results didn&rsquo;t coincide with the politically correct mantra of &#8220;equality between the races&#8221;.  One area in which this blackout [pardon the pun] of information has really hurt America is in the early childhood education.</p>
<p>Ability level + motivation are two key components of student achievement.  IQ plays a prominent role in ability level.  Let&rsquo;s face it, a student with an 80 IQ will never be able to learn at the same pace and level as the student with a 120 IQ.  But yet, there they are, sitting in the same classroom for the first 7-8 years of school.  It is only at the high school level that the high achieving student is able to segregate himself by ability level by enrolling in Advanced Placement, Honors, College Prep, or other higher level classes.</p>
<p>Too little, too late, IMHO.</p>
<p>Educrats in America point to places like Finland and Sweden as nations who are leaving the US behind academically.</p>
<p>But they cannot bring themselves to admit the reason why.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in evolution, but the sanctimoniousness and hypocrisy of the liberals really gets me. They ridicule creationists and skeptics of global warming for their &#8220;anti-scientific&#8221; views, when they, the liberals, themselves believe science should be censored when it comes to exploring racial differences in IQ. </p>
<p>It all depends whose ox is being gored, I guess, or whose pet theory is being questioned, as the case may be. In any event, it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly they are willing to push science aside the moment it ventures into forbidden territory.</p>

		<p>If blacks scored higher in IQ testing&hellip;it wouldn&rsquo;t be a taboo.</p>
<p>Instead, it would be on the front page of every paper in the world as proof that RACISM is the reason blacks fail at everything that doesn&rsquo;t involve jumping or running.  </p>

		<p><i>Why Did Studying Intelligence Become Taboo?</i></p>
<p>When telling the truth about racial differences in IQ started ending one&rsquo;s career, if not threaten his life.  Ask James Watson.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;We listened to the intelligence experts in the 20th century with dire consequences,&#8221; Murdoch says.</i></p>
<p>What might those &#8220;dire consequences&#8221; be, Mr. Murdoch?</p>
<p>The fact that blacks cannot achieve at the level of whites no matter how much money is thrown at them?   Dire consequences resulted when IQ experts and racial IQ differences were ignored, when a trillion dollars was spent over sixty years trying to educate blacks to the level of whites.  A trillion dollars spent over sixty years and the IQ gap remains as wide and intractable as ever.</p>
<p><i>Just ignore them.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to recognize that racial IQ differences exist, stop spending billions of dollars on something intractable and ignore you.</p>

		<p>There are racial diferences in athletic ability. Does anyone deny THAT? So, why is controversial to point out racial differences in mental ability? No one will deny that blacks can run and jump better than other ethnic groups (whites, Asians, etc.). So, what&rsquo;s wrong with pointing out where non-blacks have it on blacks?</p>

		<p>The refusal in our society to acknowledge racial differences in intelligence has had real ramifications. It isn&rsquo;t boring, but even if it was, it&rsquo;s highly relevant for that reason alone. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to people from other countries about the US educational system before, and one thing that they are always surprised by is that we don&rsquo;t divide students into a college-track and a trade-track at some point like most other countries seem to do. I tell them it&rsquo;s politically impossible in the United States, because the result would be a vanishingly tiny percentage of blacks being placed on the college track. Can you imagine the uproar if some school district tried to do something like this and only 1 out of 50 blacks made the college track, compared to 1 out of 5 whites? </p>

		<p>There is an important truth about the United States. Many whites and most blacks are incapable of learning marketable job skills for a high tech economy. Because the implications of this truth are lethal to what most liberals want to achieve, they try to suppress mention of it. Because conservatives like to pretend that that there is moral significance to the distribution of wealth, they allow liberals to suppress the truth.<br>
 <br>
There is reason for being reticent about this truth. If you are invited to a dinner party at Georgetown it would be impolite to tell anyone that the hostess worked her way through Vassar as a call girl, especially if she did. Nevertheless, the truth has legitimate policy implications. There need to be places where it can be discussed candidly.  </p>

		<p>There is a passage in 1984 where George Orwell says - in effect, it has been years since I read it - that a political ideology may say that 2 + 2 = 5, and the government exposing the ideology may punish those who say otherwise. Nevertheless, where it is really important for the government, such as in military matters, it is still understood that 2 + 2 = 4.<br>
 <br>
Although it is dangerous in the current political climate to acknowledge the importance of intelligence differences, the military remains committed to intelligence testing. Employers in the private sector are increasingly using it in making employment decisions. </p>

		<p>The first time I visited Las Vegas I asked a friend what the function of the pit bosses was. He replied that they were there &#8220;to see that nothing interferes with the smooth flow of money from your pocket to theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virtually all the things we discuss on this site have been put in place by anti-Whites to prevent interference with the smooth progress of White Genocide. The smooth flow of life from Whites to non-Whites.</p>
<p>1. Anti-Whites don&rsquo;t allow IQ to be discussed because the falsehood that all races are the same is used by anti-Whites to justify White Genocide.</p>
<p>2. Whether you believe the statement below to be the truth or a lie, the constant repetition of &#8220;Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi&#8221; is done to demoralize Whites and smooth the progress of White Genocide:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Nazis went so far as to execute untold thousands of low IQ scorers&hellip;Coming two decades after the Nazis used IQ to justify slaughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol! Nothing the Nazis did or didn&rsquo;t do has been &#8220;untold&#8221;&hellip;.give me a break!</p>
<p>If you object to these or any other measures that smooth the process of White Genocide, you&rsquo;re a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews!</p>
<p>The people who devise and enforce these genocidal measures say they are anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White.</p>

		<p>#2 hit it exactly. The more we study IQ, the more we see blacks always have been &amp; always will be at the bottom of the ladder, and several rungs down from everyone else at that. The proof for it is as overwhelming as any proof can be. Any real discussion of the implications of this clear and simple truth is off limits due to the embarassment is causes - not blacks&rsquo; embarassment, but ours. Picking on the little defenseless guy runs strongly against our sensibilities and is thus discouraged. Add to this the strong associations in the popular mind with Nazis (pre-Nazi leftist eugenicists somehow get a pass on this) and all comparisons between races have the tenedency to make people squirm. That is, of course, unless it shows something supposedly flattering or complimentary about blacks.    </p>

		<p>Also taboo that many Asian-Indians have skin darker than your average American Black, yet we do better than whites on tests such as the SATs and other standardized achievement tests given in the U.S.</p>
<p>Your average American white thinks that race=skin color and a good portion would mistake a South Indian for Black upon sight.</p>
<p>Liberals can&rsquo;t explain why we fall into a total opposite pattern of Blacks if their excuse is that Blacks do poorly because whites are prejudiced against them cuz of &#8216;da color of their skin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I think this IQ taboo will be broken sometime within the next five years which is why I plan to move to Singapore next summer. When the racial reality in America comes to wake, I&rsquo;m afraid that I&rsquo;ll be mistaken for Black and force to live among them.</p>
<p>In Singapore, there is plenty of diversity  but it&rsquo;s all of the Asian variety and people there KNOW that Indians are NOT Black and my chances of being mistaken for Black there are ZERO because there are NO Blacks in Singapore.</p>

<p>The primary difficulty with your &ldquo;mantra&rdquo; is that it is both nonsensical and awkward.</p>
<p>It is nonsensical because the phrase &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; is not a word used in common speech. It therefore cannot be a &ldquo;code word&rdquo; by any intelligible stretch.</p>
<p>The slogan is awkward because the human mind doesn&rsquo;t process negative statements with great facility, particularly double negatives. &ldquo;The mantra&rdquo; is a double negative.</p>

		<p>@Tim in Indiana- great point about the hypocrites on the left regarding science. I admit to watching Bill Maher at times because of his anti-corporate and anti-congress opinion on things. But this is one major area that he and others of his ilk are hypocritical. On science and global warming, he agrees that there is scientific evidence to suggest man has sped up the process of climate and its extreme changes throughout the world. </p>
<p>But when it comes to racial differences from a scientific standpoint, no liberal, (or conservative for that matter) wants to touch the topic. Another sad commentary that will only lead to more racial divisiveness in the long run. In the hair-brain stream media, all over the headlines when a black does something groundbreaking for the 1st time, it&rsquo;s etched in stone and a must read. But when poor Whites are beaten, raped and harassed at majority black schools throughout America not a word is mentioned. </p>
<p>The irony in all this is not lost on me. Here in Cleveland the other night, there was an attractive Caucasian feature dominated black woman (think pretty young long haired brunette with,a permanent tan) and she had a police sketch of a suspected police assailant in her hand. He was wanted in Akron (a majority black area in Ohio) on sexual assault charges, and was pulled over by cops, waited until the policemen approached to his driver side window, restarted the car and took off on the interstate. The black female reporter held the sketch up to the camera. He was black, but she did not verbally mention his race. Might this be a new practice so to notify the public without declaring the color of the assailant? Well, that is a start back to what is right.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s in contrast to what must have been the stupefaction with which Whites greeted the introduction of the brand new word &ldquo;racist&rdquo; into their world 50 or 60 years ago.

<p>&#8220;Educrats in America point to places like Finland and Sweden as nations who are leaving the US behind academically.</p>
<p>But they cannot bring themselves to admit the reason why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worry not. Sweden has already suffered a steep reduction in its academic standards (being just about the most fanatically multicultural nation anywhere), and us Finns are facing decreasing performance as well. Sure, there are plenty of reasons for that, but none of them will be effectively addressed, since our teacher&rsquo;s union is in hysterics about &#8220;hate speech in classrooms&#8221; and shouting how addressing that should be the responsibility of all teachers, no matter what the subject (anti-racist mathematics, right).</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe I&rsquo;m just a little bit bitter. Primary education is one of the very few things that really works here, and it&rsquo;s being thrown upon the pyre. More diversity. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;ll fix it.</p>
<p>#10 Tim in Indiana,</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a firm believer in evolution, but the sanctimoniousness and hypocrisy of the liberals really gets me. They ridicule creationists and skeptics of global warming for their &ldquo;anti-scientific&rdquo; views, when they, the liberals, themselves believe science should be censored when it comes to exploring racial differences in IQ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of people couldn&rsquo;t possibly care less about scientific method. They just want to hijack the hard-won credibility of science to their own ends. Someone who actually follows the profound skepticism and empiricism of the method is at best an embarassment to them, at worst a real danger.</p>

<p>Most criminal activity, especially violent, does not require any amount intelligence, rather the willingness to commit heinous acts. If you are willing to offer an old lady to help her with her grocery bags, and hit her over the head &amp; rob her when alone, does that make you intelligent for tricking her, or just sadistic and evil with no conscience? By the way, the &#8220;tricking the old lady&#8221; crime was what Teddy Atlas said Mike Tyson was sent to &#8220;youth prison&#8221; for when he was a young teenager. </p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re talking about a Bernie Madoff or Ivan Boesky, then I will grant you some intelligence was involved there, along with a big void in ethical conduct. But you won&rsquo;t find criminals like that in the ghettos.</p>

<p>Evolution is a set of scientific hypotheses.  &#8220;Belief&#8221; in it is not appropriate.  One examines facts and evidence for and against hypotheses.  Evolution is NOT a religion (unless the atheists want to admit that what they are is a religion and admit they serve a force of unspeakable evil based on the fruits of their way of thinking).  &#8220;Faith&#8221; is not supposed to be a factor.  Evidence is the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>And with regard to evolution, ALL of the evidence point to it as being largely invalid.  From examination of the fossil record to the ridiculous hoaxes that times and time again have been debunked (yet CONTINUE to be provided as evidence) to the complete failure of evolution to be observed on the microbiological level, as far as I can tell, not a single shred of valid evidence in support of this theory has ever been provided.  Instead, &#8220;belief&#8221; is put forth, largely to try and challenge Christian faith&hellip;.which IS a religion and NOT a science and not held to the same set of rules.</p>
<p>It gets ridiculous.  For example, the primordial ooze explanation of the beginning of life is patently absurd and violate the prime scientific tenant of biology&hellip;.that life only comes from life and never non-life.  That alone puts it in company of the worst failure of scientific theory.</p>
<p>Evolution is actually a two pronged attack by those who despise whites and civilization.  The attack against Christian faith most people understand.  And one only has to look at the various incredible genocides that always step hand in hand with marxist atheism adopted as government to see in rather obvious fashion that, whatever their supposed faith or non-faith, these people are hardcore devoted to the service of evil.</p>
<p>But the more insidious brain washing is the attempt to undermine science.  Science is nothing more and nothing less than an important toolkit of careful observation, application of specific logical rules and attempts to assert reliable controls over reproducible phenomenon that are objective.  It has served the white race well for thousands of years in its various forms.  The liberals would undermine this and then destroy it by replacing &#8220;science&#8221; with calls to authority, dogma, heresy and shouting down of those who disagree, no matter what the evidence says.</p>

		<p>There is another, extremely important reason that the enemies who control our mainstream media, academia, government, and financial sectors are vainly trying to keep the cork in the bottle on the topic of IQ differences between the races - it has to do with their larger and far more diabolically evil, sinister, and malicious agenda of pushing miscegenation between White females and black males.  </p>
<p>Now,   I could be way off base here, but my instincts tell me that very few White females - armed with up-front, prior knowledge of the 15 to 20 point average IQ deficit between those black males that our media constantly try to sell to them as great choices for bed partners and mates and  the White men of their own race - would completely throw aside this knowledge and deliberately want to produce IQ deficient off-spring.   Mother Nature&rsquo;s influence over the reproductive process of all mammals tends to drive the female to seek to mate who is the strongest, most intelligent,  and most genetically fit - because that ensures the off-spring of such a union would have a far better chance of survival.  Human Anthropology 101.   </p>
<p>Therefore, in just about every area of our rapidly decomposing society and nation that even remotely touches on the subject of race - if you simply view it through a prism of &#8216;does this help or hinder the progress of genociding White European people&rsquo; - you will literally always find that our Cultural Marxist enemies have erected taboos or passed laws or tried to categorize any open discussion of the given topic as &#8216;hate speech&rsquo;.    </p>
<p>By the way.  For those in the AR community who naively think that these enemies of ours are going wake up one day and decide to change their genocide objectives towards White European people voluntarily, and that we, as Whites, can continue to stand like a deer in the headlights and do nothing in our own defense - I have some bad news for you.   They won&rsquo;t.   </p>
<p>They will cease and desist only when we force them to.   They will cease and desist only when they can be made to experience real, extremely unpleasant, and profoundly negative consequences for what they are attempting to do to our race and civilization. <br>
 <br>
Bring on the Genocide Trials.   <br>

		<p>There is plenty of research on intelligence.  Type &#8220;IQ&#8221; and &#8220;heritability&#8221; into Google Scholar, set it to show articles from 2000, and there are over 8500 papers, most on technical and scientific aspects of the topic using good methodology, rather than the PC handwaving you bemoan here.  The scientific work costs a lot of money, and I doubt the Pioneer Fund provides 1% of the cited documents in the sample I direct you to, which probably means private or even State money underpins these efforts.  Perhaps you mean a dearth of research on IQ and race?  Er, no - 24900 papers published since 2000 using the same method as above, including a fair number that are technical or neuroscience-related.  it&rsquo;s supposedly the enemy who confuse a fact and an opinion.

<p>Lets see. In civil service employment in this city (police and fire), the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Index)test, along with other psych testing, are still used. Search Amren for articles on that test and how blacks do on it. A little problem with the ability to postpone gratification, hyper positive self esteem, etc., is revealed by the test as RACIALLY unequally endowed.</p>
<p>Its not just &#8220;g&#8221; or &#8220;general intelligence&#8221; that psych research shows racial differences in, but the mind and body in general, including such things as testosterone levels and its personality trait, aggression.</p>
<p>The MMPI continues in use. Medical science continues to research into and inform people of the racial differences in health risks.<br>
Blacks continue to be worshiped by liberals for athletic superiority, with white liberals mocking any &#8220;Great White Hope&#8221; or attempt of whites to compete against their black athletic clear (at least in liberal minds) superiors.</p>
<p>(Of course, the &#8220;Great Black - white liberal sports journalist or broadcaster - Hope&#8221; in athletics is the running &#8220;super athletic&#8221; black quarterback, e.g. Cunningham, McNabb, and now Vic. It would seem that quick mental response and superior &#8220;touch&#8221; make whites better quarterbacks. Can you say Aaron Rogers?)</p>
<p>Everyone, white, black, brown, Asian, knows that all this stuff is true (though blacks and browns - while boasting in such things as their racially distinct athletic and aggression superiority - try desperately to deny the obvious about their racially distinct IQ deficit, and adore white liberals who tell them to ignore it). </p>
<p>When it comes to IQ, truth is no defense.</p>

<p>Have you done your research properly on Singapore? Singapore is rife with racial tension. There have actually been race riots in Singapore, but not for some time. Violence had been subdued by strict laws from their fragile dictatorship. Singapore enforces forms of socialism and affirmative action as well. </p>
<p>Singapore has a large population of Malay Muslims.  What has been the history between Hindus and Muslims in your country? Do you think all of that animosity has somehow mysteriously vanished?  Also, Singapore regularly accepts black Africans as guest works. Have a look around the constructions sites, you will see them.</p>
<p>Some Indian students have some impressive work ethic and academic skills, but they are not more intelligent than whites. Where do you acquire your statistics? I admit that I don&rsquo;t know the exact statistics, but WHAT HAS INDIA EVER INVENTED?  Did India invent the automobile, telephone, light bulb, rocket propulsion, jet, nuclear fission, the computer? NO, they did not.  These are exclusively European and European American inventions.</p>
<p>I have respect for my Indian colleagues and have nothing against the country, but your comments fill me with rage. I will not hate an entire race of people based soley on the comments of one idiot. I must warn you that not everyone in the world is rational and calm. Sadly, your comments ignite racial hatred on your people. Whites are constantly being attacked in western society.  Comments like yours are simply more attacks which only generate only more anger. </p>
<p>Enjoy Singapore, but don&rsquo;t expect it to be paradise. After the novelty wears off, you will see that it has many of the same problems that you thought you were escaping.</p>

		<p>Re esp. 32.<br>
I try to approach the arguments for and against evolution with an open mind.  The diverse multiplicity of fixed life-forms in existence or in the fossil record, and proposed mutation rates, seem good arguments against it, or at any rate against an entirely aimless process.<br>
On the other hand, stories and chronology in Genesis do not seem to be literally accurate, e.g. the descent of all human races from Noah just a few thousand years ago.<br>
The genetic diversity of human groups and its correlation with a now fairly substantial hominid fossil record, plus DNA analysis, points to evolutionary differentiation (especially intellectual and physical adaptation to climate) within Homo sapiens over a very long period of time, although there are disagreements about the migrations and relationships of human subspecies. Significant variations in average intelligence among human breeding populations are well established, as also are genetic components in brain function.<br>
Zoroastrian and Hebrew sacred literature may contain moral wisdom in metaphorical form about the nature of humanity, but outside of genetics and palaeontology, theodicy remains a problem. How is a God of an infanticidal Deluge, or of painful carnivore predation, worthy of adoration?<br>
White nationalists with reading time to spare may find three very different books of unusual research interest:<br>
(1)Prof. Vincent Sarich &amp; Frank Miele, &#8220;Race: The Reality of Human Differences&#8221; (2005); (2) Prof. Christopher M Hutton, &#8220;Race and the Third Reich&#8221; (2005); (3) Lawrence Blanchard, &#8220;Did All Races Come From Adam?&#8221; (2001). Details from Amazon/Google.</p>

		<p>Behavior linked to genetics is at least accemtable for study in Russia today.  There was a very interesting article in the March 2011 &#8220;National Geographic&#8221; about a Siberian research group in Novosibersk that raised foxes.</p>
<p>The researchers bred some foxes based on how friendly they were toward people, and another group of animals based on how unfriendly they were.  Generations of each group were selectively bred for the desired characteristics.  After nine generations the friendly group weren&rsquo;t just tame; they were completely domesticated and loved human companionship the way dogs do.</p>
<p>An interesting part of the experiment was when one of the 9th (I think) generation &#8220;unfriendly&#8221; fox kits was raised by a friendly mother.  It remained extremely hostile to humans.  In short, nurture meant absolutely nothing and nature meant everything.  The Russians conducted the same breeding experiment with rats and mink.  Only after their results were published was a German group willing to experiment along the same lines with rats.</p>
<p>Read the article; your library likely has back issues of National Geographic.  It&rsquo;ll also make you want a pet fox.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And with regard to evolution, ALL of the evidence point to it as being largely invalid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, it is the exact opposite. Since the discovery of DNA, it has reinforced evolution as a fact. As a scientist I have never met a non-religious scientist who did not believe in evolution. Not one. Evolution also explains perfectly the qualities of Whites compared to other races. </p>
<p>I have nothing against people who worship the Sun, or elephant Gods. Or people who believe in Middle Eastern fairy tales. However I must take them to task when they go against scientific facts based on their personal superstitions.</p>

		<p>Obviously, studying intellect is taboo because it bares out the fact blacks and hispanics aren&rsquo;t as smart as Whites and asians. But that&rsquo;s not important anymore. We&rsquo;ve log since crossed our Rubicon. We must ready ourselves for the task ahead of us, the sending blacks and hispanics away, voluntarily or otherwise, whatever it takes. </p>

		<p>Wxcuse me, but what is this &ldquo;Asians&rdquo;?  </p>
<p>You call Hugo Chavez, Manolo of  Mexico City or  Sanchez of Peru Americans, just because they all live in Continent Americas?   Total madness. <br>
 <br>
&ldquo;Asians&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Asian&rdquo;,  is a terminology used by hostile main stream media to deliberately burr the water. </p>
<p>To counter this, the very first thing EVERY self-respect AMRENers should do, I would say, is not to play their games by refusing to recognise main stream media propaganda of &ldquo;Asians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Asian&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>And exactly who are &ldquo;Asians&rdquo;?  Kazakhs? Sri Lankans? Indians? Koreans? Chinese?  Afganistanis? Japanese? Pakistanis, Bangladesh or Turks?  They are all &ldquo;Asians&rdquo;, likes such as NYT would insist. <br>
  <br>
In reality there&rsquo;s NO such things as &ldquo;Asians&rdquo; or &#8220;Asian&#8221;.   </p>
<p>There are only:  </p>
<p>NE Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans);</p>
<p>SE Asians ( Philippinos, Indonesians, Malays,  Vietnamese, etc. );</p>
<p>and South Asians ( Indians, Pakistanis, Sri lankas alike).  </p>
<p>They are as different groupings to each other as Euro Americans to Mexicans and to Blacks, even though 30% of Malaysians and many Vietnamese are in fact ethnic Chinese or partially such. </p>
<p><br>
Note that American main stream media (also this Sureesh) use &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; American SAT score  – which is as absurd as using the average score of South Americans, Caribbeans and North Americans to represent  Euro Americans in the US.</p>
<p>BTW, average IQ of Indians is 81, slightly higher than that of Sub-Sahara Africans.  So next time when you use absurd wordings such as &ldquo;Asians&#8221;, you are effectively admitting to the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; that Whites and Sub-Sahara Blacks are interchangeable.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;upper class&rdquo; Indians in America is not that better if one refuses looking at the PC stats of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo;Americans (which include every Zhang, Suzuki, Aziz, Gonzales, Azturk, Mohamed and Sureesh) but concentrating on those of Indians which are, of course, verboten by the main stream media.<br>

		<p>Sureesh,</p>
<p>Your Indians average IQ is about 81, lower than American Blacks who have 85 (thanks to interbred with Euro Americans throughout history) .  It is an empirical fact, determined by Indian average brain size, reproduction level such as hormone, skeleton, dental and motor maturation development levels, and personality taints such as laziness and aggressiveness, etc. numerous biological characteristics in comparison to other S / SE Asian countries in its backyard.</p>
<p>Historically, Indians have been known as small time Con Man in all countries of SE and NE Asia. Else traveling in India itself tomorrow will remind you of this &#8220;stereotype&#8221; every minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;high IQ&#8221; Indians? &#8220;IT super genius&#8221;?, etc, etc?</p>
<p>Any country in NE / SE Asia wants to import these &#8220;IT geniuses&#8221; like corporate USA desperately does?</p>
<p><br>
No, but no thanks. </p>
<p>No one, but USA, Canada and Australia!   Even the UK knows now it is a scam.</p>
<p>Name ONE, just ONE commercial software invented wholly by &ldquo;Indian geniuses&rdquo; that everyone knows about it and buys it?</p>
<p>Zero!</p>
<p>- That Pentium chip was a 5th generation chip invented by a consortium of American scientists, not by Indians.</p>
<p>- Hotmail is just a simple web mail which had been freely in use by American/British universities long before that Indian person stole it. </p>
<p>- USB wasn&rsquo;t created by Ajay Bhat, but by a multi-company consortium. </p>
<p>- HDTV was invented by the Japanese, not the Indians as they boast.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;Made-in India&rdquo; is non-existed  while &ldquo;Invented by India&rdquo; is next to &ldquo;Invented by Africa&rdquo; </p>
<p>-– go check WIPO site for India&rsquo;s patent ranking on a global stage.  E.g. Netherlands, a tiny place of 15 million people, invents more tech stuff ANNUALLY than what 1.2 billion-strong-India could do in the last 20 years putting together!</p>
<p>If Indians are high IQ, then the Dutch must be the advanced third-kind from Orion Galaxy.  </p>
<p><br>
Let the reality speak: </p>
<p>Every country with mass Indian immigration crashes and burns: USA with its Silicon Valley &ldquo;techie&rdquo; scams, UK with its NHS Indian &ldquo;doctors&rdquo; scams,  and of course Dubai/UAE real estate &ldquo;marketing guru&rdquo; scams&hellip;</p>
<p>Every company outsourcing India with a large Indian presence fails: PeopleSoft(failed), Sun Micro(failed), Bell Labs (Arun Netravalli - head, closed, turned into a shopping mall), Quark (Alukah Kamar CEO, fired), Skype (Madhu Yarlagadda fired), MIT Media Lab Asia (canceled), Intel Whitefield processor project (cancelled, Indian staff canned), Apple R&D; CLOSED in India in 2006, etc, etc.</p>
<p>Indian &#8220;outsourcing high tech geniuses&#8221; are a myth, a poster boy, invented by global mainstream media (CNN, BBC, etc.) either to fit in their left political ideology or  paid handsomely (e.g. Forbes, Time) by PR firms of NASSCOM - an Indian lobby consortium of Mittel, HCL, Wipro and Tata.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s natural really, as CEOs of America Inc. getting cheap labour (and worth the very pennies of what they pay for) and their fat bonuses, the liberal political elites getting their hard earned new vote banks, while NASSCOM Indian scam-multinationals getting their giant profit share in this outsourcing scam as the originator, making them BILLIONAIRES.  Who are the suckers then in the ring?    &mdash;   White American Middle Class.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite a no-brainer really, as these &#8220;high IQ Indian geniuses and management gurus&#8221;, including poster boy  the so-called &ldquo;high&rdquo; caste and &ldquo;high&rdquo; IQ Brahmins, live in absolute chaos and poverty in their own hometowns in India proper ( even can&rsquo;t manage to build a earlier 20th century covered sewage system without the combined handouts of Bill &amp; Mellinda Gates Foundation, Asian Development Bank and the UN Food Aid   &mdash;   well, even with it, they still can&rsquo;t! ) with no hope of self-improving for the foreseeable future, whereas they all suddenly become &#8220;high tech high IQ geniuses &#8221; of Silicon Valley and &#8220;Management Gurus&#8221; of American universities the very next day they land on previously prosperous American soil which (of course) desperately needs Indian &#8220;high tech&#8221; niche to survive.</p>
<p>India as a country is the single largest AID recipient in post WWII world history, as it still is today, according to the UN and World Bank, far larger than any single Sub Saharan African country.   </p>
<p>It boggles mind to believe that to &ldquo;save&rdquo; the Western civilisation, the West needs to import millions upon millions of  Indian &ldquo;high&rdquo; IQ &ldquo;techies&rdquo; who have failed to build anything worth mentioning in India in its entire existence. What a laugh!</p>

		<p>They can deny it all they want, but the truth about IQ is obvious to everybody.  Life is a daily intelligence test. If you want to know anyone&rsquo;s IQ, simply look at how that person lives his or her life. It works for groups as well as individuals - it works for nations even.

		<p>A couple years ago, I remember coming across an article. Research had found that red-heads were the most intelligent of all hair colors.<br>
I did a google search and up came many search results   &mdash;   all referencing the same red-head intelligence research.</p>
<p>A couple days later, I wanted to send my friend, who&rsquo;s a carrot-top redhead, the link to the article. I hadn&rsquo;t bookmarked it, but I thought it&rsquo;d be easy just to google it like I had done a couple days prior. I tried searching for it, and the google search results came up with nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the news article dissappeared, and had just vanished without a trace in several locations.</p>
<p>About IQ:<br>
I have saw many IQ results say that &#8220;asians&#8221; are the most intelligent. But how intelligent is it to overpopulate your country and have the majority of your country living in abject poverty? How intelligent is it to kill off all your female babies? Etc?</p>
<p>It would seem intelligence isn&rsquo;t being measured *collectively*. There should be a *collective intelligence* IQ measurement. In that case, all you have to do is look at history to know who&rsquo;s the most intelligent. What race invented Computers, phone, electricity, motorized vehicle, air travel, democracy, vaccines, internet, refrigerator, etc, etc, etc. Sorry, none of it was asians. Einstein wasn&rsquo;t Chinese. Sorry.<br>

<p>Northern China is a huge flat land with adequate four-season temperatures.  Due to the early complete mastery of advanced agriculture (e.g. irrigating) technologies, Han Chinese were able to sustain such a huge population that the world has never seen.  In fact for the most part of, if not entire, history, China has the largest population in the world. They then have spread to Japan in the East and as far as Vietnam in the South.  Don&rsquo;t you think that the size of population, under normal circumstance ( that is, for example,  not due to UN Food Missions which apply to places like Africa and India), is actually a clear indication of how successfully a race is in the eyes of Mother nature?  Europeans have become highly successful after the Enlightment hence the population exploded as well, expanding to today&rsquo;s Americas and Australia.  </p>
<p>If Chinese &ldquo;kill off all their female babies&rdquo;, then almost certain that they as a people won&rsquo;t last very long in world history, will they?</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;Einstein is not Chinese&rdquo; ( assuming Einstein is not a fraudster as some evidences indicate), perhaps you could ask yourself where was Einstein before he became famous? <br>
 <br>
That&rsquo;s right: he, like almost all of Ashkenazi Jews, were and have always been in the heartlands of industrial revolution (Germany, UK and USA) for the last 200 years, speaking German or English as the first language, taking advantage of immense and critïcal technological, educational and academic enablers right at the door step – a key reason why on a percentage basis Ashkenazis seem so successful vis-à-vis others such as Whites or NE Asians,  because you can barely find any of their entire right-side bell curve outside the key &ldquo;milking zones&rdquo;. <br>
 <br>
On the contrary, few Chinese in the right end of the bell curve spoke English or German as the first language and resided in the cutting edge cities such as Berlin, Vienna, London, Boston, NYC during the industrial revolution.  The Chinese &ldquo;Einsteins&rdquo;, being FAR more than Jews could ever chunk out in sheer numbers I can assure you due to simple Maths on the corresponding IQ bell curves, were,  and perhaps still are, re-educating themselves in some South China rice fields or oil rig gulags somewhere near permafrozen Manchuria thanks to continuous wars, communism, sheer ignorance or just plain evil of the socialist CPC government, and the key drawback of 2000-year-old centralised Confucius culture where &ldquo;a nail sticking out is hammered down or just taken out, permanently&rdquo;. <br>

Into the social interest group of &#8220;white&#8221; I throw East Asians and any other group who lives like &#8220;whites&#8221;.  Immigrant groups from areas of lower IQ who are largely professionals (&#8220;techies&#8221;) likely have higher IQ&rsquo;s than their fellow stay-behinds and are included as a &#8220;Pelasgian&#8221; element or substrata in the &#8220;white&#8221; population.</p>
<p>2.  &#8220;Brown&#8221; - In our situation, most Hispanics (though not all - some qualify as &#8220;black&#8221;, some as &#8220;white&#8221;), mixed race types, and any non- &#8220;black&#8221;, non- &#8220;white&#8221;.  &#8220;Browns&#8221; include fallen &#8220;whites&#8221;, raised &#8220;blacks&#8221;, and spit out a &#8220;white&#8221; from time to time, are subsumed by the &#8220;black&#8221; as well, which explains a certain hostility toward the &#8220;black&#8221;.</p>
<p>3. &#8220;Black&#8221; - Mostly subsumed by Subsaharan African genetics.  Includes many fallen whites/browns, sometimes spits out some curve blowers.</p>

<p>Sorry, never heard of this Ravi D. Vakil.  Assume that he is famous, so what?  Any race can always mention several names, yet individual excellence is no representative of the underlying race.  If your logic, all of us would be sub-human since no one run as remotely fast as Usain Bolt?</p>
<p>Thanks to mention International Math Olympiad, since for its entire history India as a country has been nowhere near the top 15 ranking list, which have been dominated by NE Asians and White European/US teams EVERY year.  On a percentage basis, Hungrians or Ukranians are much more succefful in Maths than Indians who mythically dub themselves as &ldquo;Super Maths Geniuse&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t mention that silly BrahMos, which is largely a handout from Russia to India based on Soviet&rsquo;s 1960s technologies. As for Speed, there are TONS of supersonic missiles faster than BrahMos in the American, Russian and Chinese arsenals.  In fact, the new generations of cruise missiles for the past decades have been geared to be deliberately slower in order to achieve the trade-off of super manoeuvrability.  India&rsquo;s missile technologies are at least 3 decades behind China in almost all categories (similar missiles as BrahMos were in fashion in China in the 1970&rsquo;s),  and possiblely 4 decades behind Russia and the US.<br>
 <br>
As for &ldquo;India gdp is expected to become the third largest (nominal) in 2020(Standard Chartered) and the largest (purchasing power parity) in 2050 (Citigroup)&rdquo;, I am sure that India&rsquo;s GDP would become the largest in the solar system by 2095 following the same trendline of Citigroup&rsquo;s Indian analysts based in Mumbai.<br>

		<p>Put it this way: If there really were no differences between racial groups, ALL races would have developed at virtually the same rate since the Cro-Magnons replaced the Neanderthals. Meaning that regarding gaining and using knowledge, inventing machines and systems to make life easier, etc., the difference between White Europeans and the non-White races would have been measurable at most in decades, not centuries&hellip; respective to Orientals, or thousands of years, respective to Black African people.</p>

<p>27 percent of Chinese in Singapore had a university education</p>
<p>compared to 31 percent of Indians(Star Nov 26, 2006).</p>
<p>The average income for Chinese was S 5,600, whereas the average </p>
<p>for Indian for the same year was S 5,200. So one group had </p>
<p>slightly higher income, the other slighly more education. There</p>
<p>was really no significant difference in achievement between the </p>
<p>two in Singapore.</p>

<p>Your comment lead me to google for modern cannibalism in Africa.  A 2009 article on poor African nutrition &amp; HIV/AIDS reveals that cannibalism was recently a  problem in Kenya, the Congo &amp; Sub Sahara Africa. The author&rsquo;s theory is that a corn-based diet produces a &#8220;mental illness&#8221; that leads these Africans to believe that cannibalism will cure AIDS or make them rich. The nutrition argument is sometimes made for IQ differences in the U.S. even though our poor are obese &amp; obviously getting more than enough protein. </p>
<p>Off-topic but FYI, Albinos are in particular danger. Travel somewhere else.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;If you believe that IQ measures something genetic, scientifically and precisely measurable, and of paramount importance in life, then it&rsquo;s easy to believe that people who score very low should not be allowed to have children,&rdquo; says human-rights lawyer turned journalist Stephen Murdoch, author of IQ: A Smart History of a Failed Idea (Wiley, 2007).</p>
<p> &mdash; </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he would make that leap about having children, but notice that he is willing to ignore the truth, for fear of how others will use the truth. Is that really his job?</p>

<p>Below 75 IQ sterilized? Would that be a bad idea? That would be a very constructive idea, given the &#8216;average&rsquo; socio-pathological implications of having 5% of the given population below 75 (White) IQ. Whites, blacks hispanics asians, no loss. This is not the stoneage.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t buy this &ldquo;nonsense that average Indian IQs are around eighty.&rdquo;, then you must also not believe in the nonsense &ldquo;that average Sub Sahara Africa have IQs are around 65&rdquo;, do you? <br>
 <br>
Your statement says a lot of what you really think.</p>
<p>If we had no idea of the Swedish average IQ, we would only need to look at the similar people in their neighbourhood likes Danish, Norwegians, Germans and Finnish. Then we pretty much will have an idea of where the Swedes lie.</p>
<p>Here reflects the exact beauty of Richard Lynn, Phillip Rushton and mountains of other honest scientists&rsquo; conclusions: if you don&rsquo;t know or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t believe&rdquo; one particular people&rsquo;s average IQ, you can always verify it amongst their racial kins because they would fit perfectly anywhere and across time.</p>
<p>In this case, we only have to look at average IQ of Indians&rsquo; racial twins such as Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Nepalese, Sri Lankans, Afganitanis, etc in the region, we then KNOW, for sure, what is the general IQ of Indians.</p>
<p>Nice to hear that you know many smart Indians in your work. I know some really smart Africans here and there as well&hellip; your point being?</p>
<p>Mind you that Taj Majal is of precisely typical Persian/Mongol architectural style - foreign!  </p>
<p>Red Fort is Mughals for that matter- foreign!  </p>
<p>That very awesome Train Station of Mumbai, the architecture crown jewel  that Indians pride as their own like they do to Taj Majal is British Art Deco – foreign&hellip;   </p>
<p>most if not all of landmark  architectures in India were actually built by Foreign Invaders throughout the last millenniums with foreign technological and architectural know-how, not that of the locals. <br>
 <br>
Have you been to Taj Majal?  Less than 100 yards next to the main site where tourists taking photos and laundering this &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; miracle lie open sewages, mountains of garbage and human/animal wastes on both sites of the only main road in the city, decorated by countless residential &ldquo;huts&rdquo;( for want of a more lovely expression) built by cardboard and dirt&hellip; there you have the true taste what the locals are truly capable of and used to.  You tell me they are the descendents who built the Taj Majal? Please, give me a break.<br>

		<p>&#8220;my instincts tell me that very few White females - armed with up-front, prior knowledge of the 15 to 20 point average IQ deficit between those black males that our media constantly try to sell to them as great choices for bed partners&#8221;</p>
<p>Luke you don&rsquo;t get it. White women have been raised DIRT STUPID to only value fashion and image. They have thrown their brains in the toilet. </p>
<p>For them, the best mates are the most MACHO and the most FASHIONABLE. NOT the hard working or intelligent. Hell no they arent &#8220;cool&#8221;</p>
<p>What IS &#8220;cool&#8221; are Rappers. And that black man who doesn&rsquo;t have to work a real job spends all his time flipping for 18 and even 16 year old white girls who think he is cool while the white guy studies then works his ass off for years and years paying the taxes so the black guy doesn&rsquo;t have to work. </p>
<p>Women have been de-brained and their values suck. Thats why they are dating black men. </p>

<p>&rsquo;..yet individual excellence is no representative of the<br>
 underlying race&rsquo;.  It does show what the group is capable of<br>
given the large number of Indians who excel here. <br>
 The 2.8 million Asian Indians in the U.S.A have the <br>
highest household income among all racial groups.</p>
<p>India was 7th in 1998 the IMO. It had been in  23 IMOs and <br>
obtained seven more goal medals than the Netherland which participated in 41 IMOs.</p>
<p>Where is your source that there are faster cruise missiles than<br>
the BrahMos? </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with several Africans over the years, I am continually amazed at the nonsensical things I am told with a straight face:</p>
<p>1. Two Ethiopian Chrisitans told me that they &#8220;knew&#8221; the Earth was flat and that the dinosaurs never existed. They also told me their church has the Ark of the Covenant and the True Cross of Jesus, and that they had touched them, in a church in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>They also claimed to have seen their minister raise people from the dead by what sounded like the laying on of hands.</p>
<p>2. A Nigerian woman approached me at work and told me she needed money to help ransom her brother, who had been kidnapped in Africa. When I inquired as to further details, she assured me her brother, who was riding a bus across Africa, from Nigeria to Kenya, was stopped and taken by force by Russians, who then took her brother to Peru. </p>
<p>Her brother was now in Peru, in a prison camp, guarded by Russians.</p>
<p>She claimed these Russians in Peru (!) were sending her emails demanding $5,000.00 in ransom or her brother&rsquo;s foot would be cut off. </p>
<p>I got out a map and pointed out to her the absurdity of her story, but she did not seem to care. She used the same tale on numerous others in the office and some gave her money.</p>
<p>3. An African American man I met a few years ago told me he was Jewish. I asked him how he became Jewish, and since I had many Jewish friends while growing up (and I&rsquo;ve been to several bar mitzvahs), I quizzed him on the basics of the Talmud and the Torah. I began to think he was full of crap when he did not know who Yahweh/YHVH was. </p>
<p>He did claim, repeatedly, that Black Africans are the real/true Jewish people described in the Bible, and that &#8220;white people&#8221; stole their story, books, teachings, and identity. He said &#8220;All those stories are about black men, and now those white liars are going around claiming our heroes are their ancestors&#8221;.</p>
<p>I said to him &#8220;So Moses was a black man&#8221;? He said &#8220;Yes, and so was Jesus&#8221;. I gave up on him at this point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few unfortunate run-ins with blacks in St. Louis who think they&rsquo;re the &#8220;true Jews.&#8221;  What they are is basically black analogues to Christian Identity.  And, here&rsquo;s a wooden nickel&rsquo;s worth of free advice to all who might encounter some   &mdash;   Never turn your back on a one of them.  The black Hebrew-Isrealites are the worst and most vicious anti-White bigots on the planet.</p>
<p>Another way you could have nailed this black H-I type with whom you were arguing:  He boasted about Jesus being black.  If he thought he was a &#8220;true Jew,&#8221; then Jesus really shouldn&rsquo;t matter that much to him.</p>

<p>So 1998 was the most lucky year in the history for Indian &ldquo;Maths geniuses&rdquo;   &mdash;   got dismal 7th place in International Maths Olympiad ? What an achievement!   Why don&rsquo;t you list all the record but cheerypick a single best year? Even an illiterate peasant can hit a small time bingo one day, if he tries long enough. </p>
<p>Again, Brahmos is patently Russian technology. You don&rsquo;t call Eurofighter or Rafale indigenous Indian after enter a tech transfer agreement with the EU, do you?  Moreover, there are many cruise missiles faster than it.  More importantly, it&rsquo;s not the faster the better any more, as if the bigger main gun calibre of a tank is., the better is the tank. It is not.  Countries with advanced missile technologies mainly aim at manoeuvrability nowadays, with deliberate lower speed - a widely accepted military doctrine.</p>
<p>The state of defence industry actually is quite an accurate indicator of the High End Average IQ of a country under normal circumstances. World&rsquo;s top defence equipments exporters are all high IQ countries, while India is the largest weapon importer in the world for some years now. According to Indian Defence Minister, more than 70% of India&rsquo;s defence technologies depend on imports which range from aircrafts, standard missiles, tanks, warships, artilleries, artilleries ammunitions, to basic rifle and some standard bullets – yes, it requires a certain IQ to be able to design and produce quality rifles and bullets.  Now, what does it tell about India&rsquo;s High End IQ average? – from which one can reliablely bootstrap India&rsquo;s general IQ bell curve assuming normal distribution.  This will also lead to India&rsquo;s low 80&rsquo;s average IQ. </p>
<p>All these banks/consulting firms you mentioned can not even technically forecast India&rsquo;s next Quarter GDP growth correctly without making some major embarrassments, let alone the likelihood that India would still exist as an entity (without being broke up by internal wars) in the next 10 years, yet &ldquo;they&rdquo; confidently &ldquo;forecast&rdquo; its GDP 3 decades into the future.  I mean &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;!   By &ldquo;they&rdquo; I refer to analysts who did the forecast   &mdash;   mostly Indian branch staff based in Mumbai and Delhi.<br>
   <br>
If a beggar gets 10-cent handout today, 15 cents tomorrow ( with 50% growth rate! ) and so on,  so do his beggar sons ( and he is busy at producing more sons), then by 2050 the beggar family will be richer than Bill Gates  following the trendline!  Mathematically, it&rsquo;s perhaps correct due to the power of multiply, but who is insane enough to believe such nonsense except Indian supremacists? </p>
<p>From this typical &lsquo;Indian analysis&rdquo; example, however, Indians&rsquo;average characteristics of strong impulse to scam, the lack of self-control, and inability to to delay gratification by empty boasting appear to fit India&rsquo;s average IQ very well from biological point of view, I&rsquo;d say.  High IQ people design, invent and produce, while Indians talk -  Kudos to the West for timely identifying this trait ( read: Call Centres).</p>
<p><br>
While they&rsquo;re gloating,  spamming the internet with India&rsquo;s &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; prosperity and its wonderful (self) projected path far into the future, why don&rsquo;t the same forecast analysts stop handing over India&rsquo;s begging bowl, the world&rsquo;s largest, for foreign aid and bank loans to the UN Food For Hunger Programme, Asia Development Bank and the World Bank for a change? Sub Sahara Africa does the same thing, yet at least I don&rsquo;t see Nigerians chest-thumping for their super high IQ and &ldquo;projected&rdquo; imminent superpower statue as Indians do. </p>
<p>Oops, you can forget about the World Bank now. The last thing we knew was  that the World Bank just BANNED India for 3 years, due to its faking major economics statistics.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to consider why opposition to such matters as<br>
intelligence testing and research about genes and IQ may exist <br>
in varied factions and may, in fact, include a wide range in which opposition is uncertain, tentative, &#8220;conflicted&#8221;, etc.  &mdash;  and thus amendable to persuasion and clarification.  An obvious irony of history is that lefties, who tend to believe mankind is capable of all sorts of perfection and empowerment, are enormously distrustful of human capacity to handle properly this matter of IQ and genes (in the context of a globe-smothering overpopulation ); the &#8220;right&#8221;, however, seems to have an endless confidence in human power to handle this human dilemma.  The hesitation as to &#8220;Where will this lead us?&#8221; is perfectly commendable.  THAT is where the locus of the dialogue should be.  It is a pathetic fallacy indeed to assume that if we just break through with more research, the weight of fact will give birth to broad social consensus.  We&rsquo;ve tried.  And failed.<br>
Is that not obvious enough?  </p>
