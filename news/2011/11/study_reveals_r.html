			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsea-Lyn Rudder, The Grio, November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When it comes to online dating, segregation appears to be alive and well. After analyzing more than one million profiles on a mainstream dating website, researchers at the University of California Berkeley, concluded that whites are highly unlikely to initiate contact with black people.</p>
<p>Even when their profiles indicate that they are indifferent about the race or ethnicity of a potential romantic interest. The researchers expected to find homophily, a social science term which means love of the same, in their analysis but they were surprised that the internet did not play a role in eroding reluctance to date outside one&rsquo;s own race.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the constraints of segregation are lifted by technology, what do people do? They don&rsquo;t act all that differently,&#8221; said Gerald Mendelsohn, PhD, one of the professors who worked on the study. &#8220;Segregation remains a state of mind as much as it is a physical reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study indicates that more than 80 percent of the communication initiated by whites was to other whites. Only 3 percent went to blacks. Black members of the same site were more open to dating whites and were ten times more likely to contact whites. Black men were actually slightly more likely to initiate contact with white women than black women.</p>
<p>Professor Mendelsohn, attributed this to the influence of cultural imperatives on all American men. &#8220;In this country, our notions of feminine attractiveness are based almost entirely on images of white women &hellip;  the hypothesis that some people have argued is that there is no surprise that black men should contact white women, because that&rsquo;s where we get our notions of who&rsquo;s pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the U.C Berkeley research, a collaboration between Professor Mendelsohn, Coye Cheshire, Andrew T. Fiore and Lindsay Shaw Taylor, black women were the least likely group of those discussed in the study, to be contacted on the unnamed dating site. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a black woman on Match.com and you&rsquo;re not going to initiate contact then you are not going to date. That&rsquo;s just the reality,&#8221; said Worthy-Davis from her home in Brooklyn. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a 2009 analysis, black women, on OkCupid.com a dating website that does not charge a subscription fee; get the &#8220;cold shoulder&#8221; from everyone, including their black male counterparts.</p>
<p>The cold shoulder comment was based upon the fact that black women receive the fewest replies on the site, even though they are the most likely to reply. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The U.C. Berkeley research indicates that although black women were much more likely than their white counterparts to contact someone of another race, they still primarily sought to contact black men.</p>

<p>I tend to think that White women are just naturally pretty. However, I actually agree with Mendelsohn premise. Let&rsquo;s make all White women ugly when it comes to advertisements, TV shows and movies so that Black men can once again chase after Black women, like they are meant to. </p>
<p>It might be in Whites favour to add to the myth that Black women are pretty, hard working and not, loud mouthed, bitter and generally over weight. Although that might also have the reverse effect on men from other races choosing to date Black women too&hellip;So maybe not.  </p>
<p>On the rest of the study this is quite the positive. I still wish it was 100 % of Whites staying within their own race, though. <br>

		<p>I wonder which was more likely, that a black man tried to contact a white woman, or a white woman tried to contact a black man.  I bet the former, ergo BM-WF couples are mainly a result of BM pressure on white women.</p>

		<p>If I was a white woman I&rsquo;d definitely avoid such dating websites. I mean, I think that they are stupid in the first place but it must be 100 times worse for a white woman. Imagine being hit on all the time by guys you are not in the least bit interested in. </p>

<p><br>
Tell me, Prof. Mendelsohn, is there a Mrs. Mendelsohn? There is, you say? And what, if I may be so rude as to inquire, is Mrs. Mendelsohn&rsquo;s first name? Is it something like &#8220;DeLaToy&rsquo;ah&#8221; or &#8220;LaQu&rsquo;ii&rsquo;sha&#8221;? Or is it something more like &#8220;Esther&#8221; or &#8220;Golda&#8221;?</p>

		<p><i>whites are highly unlikely to initiate contact with black people.</i></p>
<p>How many whites really crave more contact with blacks?  Blacks do most of the &#8220;initiating&#8221; of inter-racial contact in real life or online.  It&rsquo;s not like whites are chasing blacks around suburbs, school districts, etc.  Even white liberals often wish they had less &#8220;contact with black people&#8221;.<br>

		<p>If this article isn&rsquo;t the essence of hack egalitarian journalism, then I don&rsquo;t know what is.  What the author calls &#8220;segregation&#8221; is simply the inevitability of mating behavior asserting itself.  Notice how only whites are presumed guilty   &mdash;   in contrast, of course, to those warm, cuddly, open-minded blacks, eager to initiate interracial contact (the fact that such contact might be rooted in sinister motive is a separate issue).  </p>
<p>I do confess feeling a certain sadness for black women, given that their logical partners, black men, are off on a trophy hunt for the best white women.  </p>

		<p>These studies are always fascinating, but it I want to ask the DWLs &#8220;why all the hand wringing?&#8221; Their plan to completely displace Whites-including their own children-proceeds at a gallop and they care what people are doing on dating sites. </p>
<p>The post-modern Marxist is as bad, if not worse, than any of the religious systems throughout history. I&rsquo;m sure many Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, ect were busy-bodies that would rat on their neighbors to the religious police, but the Marxists take the cake. They are obsessed with controlling all aspects of human behavior. It&rsquo;s good to see that their attempts at thought control have only succeeded on a superficial level and when left to our own devices we will self-segregate. </p>
<p>Though the DWLs perform the research, we should say &#8220;thanks!&#8221; and promptly rub their faces in it. They just prove that racial feelings are natural and that self-loathing is unnatural.</p>

		<p>This is one of the more revolting articles I&rsquo;ve read in some time. It&rsquo;s not enough that we Whites have endured decades of brow-beating, insults, fiscal-rape, cultural-inversion, and all manner of madness in the name of &#8220;righting past wrongs,&#8221; &#8220;Diversity,&#8221; &#8220;inclusion,&#8221; and all the other Orwellian lunatic ideas and such to placate and &#8220;uplift&#8221; Blacks. Now, to add enormous insult to injury, Whites are STILL to be attacked for - of all things - not wanting to DATE or co-habitate with Blacks! Yes, even who we choose for romantic partners must now be guided by the unwritten &#8220;laws&#8221; of Political Correctness, lest we be once again scolded for our hopeless bigotry!</p>
<p>And says the good Professor, &#8220;In this country, our notions of feminine attractiveness are based almost entirely on images of white women&hellip;&#8221; Gee, I wonder why THAT is??? White women are essentially the gold-standard of beauty the world over! There is no &#8220;cultural influence&#8221; involved - one need only have EYES!!</p>
<p>Just more White-guilt hogwash. </p>

		<p>Check my math, that mean means that blacks commit about the same number of murders as all other Americans combined. </p>
<p>Assuming blacks constitute 12 percent of 100 percent of the population:</p>

		<p>So black men want white women more than they want black women.  So who is to blame?  White people brainwashed black men to be unattracted to their own women!  That has to be it!  (Oh, please.)</p>
<p>But wait a minute, who are the white women that these black men are seeking?  Almost 100% they are blonds.  Not black-haired white women, but blonds.  In my life I have seen hundreds of white female/black male pairings (because of where I live), and only ONE time did the white girl have black hair.</p>
<p>So black men have a fixation on blond hair.  I once read an article written by an Asian guy, explaining why so many Asians love white women (his observation), and he wrote that it was because &#8220;they have hair that is the color of the mid-day sun.&#8221;  And LOTS of Asian men pine after blond white women, according to him, but have little luck for a variety of reasons.  So is it the fault of white people that some Asian men loke blonds?</p>
<p>Many, many white men have a preference (or lust) for blonds also.  All this talk about blacks being &#8216;forced&rsquo; to prefer white beauty because it is &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; is hogwash.  You cannot blame a country having a standard of beauty set by its historic majority.  But more than that, pretty white women are sought after in Asia (read about it!) and western African men come over here and chase white women like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.  Arab men in Scandanavia go after white women so much that some women even dye their hair black to protect themselves!</p>
<p>People like what they like, and pretty white women seem to have the perfect balance of delicate and substance.  Of course there are a lot of manly, feminist or raunchy white women nowadays, but that&rsquo;s another story&hellip;</p>

		<p>Now what?  Are you going to ban white people from posting profiles if they say they only want to date whites?  I&rsquo;m sick of this stuff!  There&rsquo;s tons of dating sites for blacks only or Asians only and tons of meetup groups for nonwhites and gays only, but whites only and suddenly it&rsquo;s hate?</p>

		<p>Anonymous #9 - Professor Mendelsohn is a widower.  His wife&rsquo;s name was Nancy and she died in 2004 at age 67.  I don&rsquo;t believe any of his family was black, to answer your query.  I found a photo of their daughter online.</p>

Why is this an issue unless blacks are upset whites aren&rsquo;t interested in dating them.</p>
<p>I suspect this came up because black men and women were trying to date whites but found white men and women didn&rsquo;t share their views on inter-racial dating.</p>
<p>What blacks SHOULD be concerned about is why so many black men are more interested in white women than they are in black women and why more black women aren&rsquo;t raising heck about it.<br>

		<p>The reason black men prefer white women is simple&hellip;&hellip;..white women that date black men are weak, feeble minded and insecure, not to mention usually quite ugly and obese. These naive women are easy to manipulate, they usually work hard and get to pay all the bills in return for an ass smack and a tickle fight with the great black mamba.</p>
<p>Weak minded backward, insecure white women are more responsible for pending destruction of the white race than any politician is, shun them an shun them hard</p>

<p>*******************</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, White women would have chosen Black men less than one-half of 1 percent of the time.  The stats today are 3.5%.  That&rsquo;s a 700% increase.</p>
<p>I completely disagree with Mendelsohn as to why Black men seek out White women more than Black women.  White women are more feminine and far better looking than Black women.  Black men, though 20 points lower on the IQ scale than White men, don&rsquo;t need the influence of &#8220;cultural imperatives&#8221; to tell them that White women are more desirable.  All they need are two eyes to see that.  The problem is now they CAN go after White women, whereas in the past they COULDN&rsquo;T.  </p>

		<p>As a conservative Jewish geneticist and blogger, I have to disagree that blonde white women are the most beautiful in the world. That is just a western perception. Yes there maybe SOME Middle eastern adn Asian men who crave blondes, but by no means is that even remotely the vast majority. No more than SOME white men who prefer Asian, East Indian or Middle eastern women far more attractive than blondes and  red heads. Infact, more than blondes being sought after by non white men, there is a thriving industry of Asian women who are desperately sought after by white men&hellip;from Japan, Thailand, Korea to the Indo Aryan beauties of North India, Iran, Turkey and central Asia.</p>
<p> Infact at any given time there are more white men who come half way around the world for Asian women than Arab or anyother non white group seeking white women of any kind leave alone blondes. It is basically a personal prefernce and media glorification of blondes by the media that has made blonde the faux-Gold standard of beauty ( according to western standards). Infact it goes against the very strain of evolution and morphological adaptation for a sub-spieces of any organism to find it&rsquo;s opposite gender less attractive than the other spieces. Thus, to state that ANY non white man prefers a blonde Nordic woman over his own would be tantamount to claiming that Male Tigers find Female Horses far more attractive than female Tigers!</p>
<p>Imperialism and colonialism was a western venture and thus history and every norm in modern society is artifically dictated by western sensibilities - Eurocenteric world view. Thus anything white is automatically deemed superior, even if it maybe substandard in reality. The percentage of Europhiles from the non white world atleast in terms of beauty is a very small percentage. The media tends to glorify &amp; sell blonde as the most floating currency in terms of good looks ( almost like the US dollar) - such observations are NOT objective. The fact is most Jewish men prefer beautiful dark haired, brown eyed high IQ Jewish women, most East Indians prefer beautiful East Indian women, most East Asians perfer beautiful East Asian women and most Africans ( IF not brainwashed by western influence) will biologically prefer to mate with their own spieces. Its fundamental biology 101. This explains the natural trend in online dating too&hellip;birds of the same feather, flock together!</p>

		<p>it&rsquo;s not a big deal that non black men are not contacting black women or that white people tend to be into their own.  not to me anyways.  that&rsquo;s their preference.  you can&rsquo;t make someone attracted to someone they are not.  i do agree though that the high number of black men contacting white women is because they have been bombarded with images of beauty that don&rsquo;t come from their own culture since birth.  i&rsquo;m a black woman and i have never really been hard up for a date.  i&rsquo;m married now, but i used to meet good guys for the most part.  on dating sites i would get a lot of attention.  i never felt neglected.</p>

<p>But we must remember two things: 1. White women are more feminine than those of other races AND 2. White women are more attractive compared to those of color. <br>
Consequently, for these two reasons, they are less likely to initiate contact with other men, but is the reverse true? </p>
<p>Apparently not, as the following sentences suggest.<br>
&#8220;Black members of the same site were more open to dating whites and were ten times more likely to contact whites[white WOMEN, that is, as the article implies further on] Black men were actually slightly more likely to initiate contact with white women than black women.&#8221; </p>
<p>The study never ventured to explore how likely those white women were to accept these &#8220;approaches&#8221; and go on to date the men. </p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t mean to bust anyone&rsquo;s bubble here, but it&rsquo;s not UNlikely. <br>
Thanks to subtle political brainwashing in the West, starting, literally, at the kindergarten stage for 30odd years, a large number of white women actually HATE the white man. <br>
60% of the white women I see today are with men of color: blacks, Pakistanis, Arabs, etc. </p>
<p>An old Comanche proverb states that a nation cannot be conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you, posters, to put two and two together.</p>
<p>But I still remain an optimist. Hah.</p>

<p><b>Mendelsohn&rsquo;s latest research does not draw conclusions as to why online daters make certain decisions</b>,&hellip;&#8221;*</p>
<p>Black mental abilities lower standards everywhere that blacks have been imposed into the White world. But if only that were the major ill effect of blacks&rsquo; presence.</p>
<p>Blacks are the shock troops of the anti-Whites in their program of White Genocide. (And the main army is the waves of non-Whites that have arrived from south of the border and elsewhere).</p>
<p>Anti-White hearts gladden to read that &#8220;Black men were actually slightly more likely to initiate contact with white women than black women.&#8221; Is there a better way to extinguish the White race than by the successful television-commercial, school, and other encouragement to our women to have half-black babies instead of White babies?**</p>
<p>The persons and institutions that encourage White women to interracially date claim that they are anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White.</p>

		<p>Every ethnic group on the planet value fair skin. White skin is seen as pure, beautiful and desirable. From China to India to Africa to Latin America, nobody wants to be dark. Black women spend a fortune on &#8220;whitening&#8221; creams and they rank each other according to how light their skin tone is. So it is no surprise if women of European decent, the whitest of all, are desired for mating by everyone. </p>

		<p>One of the best features (and perhaps one of the few) of using online dating sites is the ability for any member to narrow the parameters of the race of the person they&rsquo;d like to date or communicate with. Depending on the site however, it doesn&rsquo;t always prevent people of other races from making overtures to you, but you simply do not respond (which happens 99.9% of the time) or you can write a note thanking the person for their interest and politely explain you don&rsquo;t date outside of your race. The internet is truly one of the last places where people can self-segregate without fear of being stigmatized or accused of the dread &#8220;racism&#8221;. And trust me, it&rsquo;s hard enough for a white guy to meet a white woman on these sites  &mdash;  if a black guy thinks he&rsquo;s gonna find a blond white beauty to fulfill some fantasy, he&rsquo;s got another thing coming. The vast majority of women on the sites are looking for a white guy. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. Ladies, any comments?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the blonde beauty part.  MOST of the black white pairings I&rsquo;ve seen on the street and in the stores are black man, not-so-rare White Buffalo.  With maybe half breeds in tow.  MORE often, you see only the large white female with half breeds in tow.  I&rsquo;m sure the black guy was out working while the large white race traitor woman was shopping, right?</p>

<p>OK, but White men are also the standard for male &#8220;beauty&#8221;. White males&rsquo; physique, especially facial features, are those associated with noble masculinity, expressiveness, harmony, &hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for nothing that other races look at White people as physically the most attractive &amp; diverse (here is your true diversity- Whites can have black, green, blue, hazel, brown, gray,..eyes; also the hair color &#8220;diversity&#8221;).  </p>

		<p>In other words: black men chase white women constantly and very aggressively. Even if they fail most of the times, if trying countless and countless times the absolute numbers will steadily shoot up.</p>
<p>This blows holes in the myth that white women &#8216;prefer&rsquo; black men. Most who date interracially are at best indifferent to races, and since black men are ultraaggressive, at some point some white women must relent. </p>
<p>The problem here is not white women. It&rsquo;s the feminised white men who sit by and do nothing. <br>
The solution to this problem is political in part, but also cultural. Equality between the sexes is to be encouraged, but feminism is to be scrapped on the ash heap of history. As well as cultural marxi*m and so forth.</p>

		<p>I was in a restaurant once when a gorgeous blonde woman walked in who could have had her choice of white men. She was with a black man and two kids that she&rsquo;d obviously had with him. One of the kids seemed generally aggressive, and it makes me wonder if bringing him into the world under those circumstances was really doing him a favor. He wasn&rsquo;t older than about seven, but he just had a look of rage in his eyes. No, I wasn&rsquo;t staring at him. He first got my attention when he pointed his finger at me, pretending to shoot. Although boys often pretend to shoot, there was just something not right with this one. </p>
<p>Like the poster above stated, it&rsquo;s interesting that so many white women who marry blacks are blonde. I&rsquo;m wondering if it&rsquo;s something to do with the jealousy these women sometimes receive that makes some of them just not care whether or not their children inherit the blonde hair, or even full white blood. </p>

<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know what attracts White females to Blacks. Myths about Blacks&rsquo; hypersexuality ? These are myths, check any list of extremely promiscuous men- exclusively Whites (mostly from entertainment scene). Masculinity ? Well, masculinity is a character trait. If we limit the issue to physical masculinity- there are way more physically dominant Whites than Blacks. Moral character ? OK, a joke. Sensibility ? Another joke. Visual image of male attractiveness ? Yet another joke. Money ? Now, this is something more tangible. My reluctant guesses are:</p>
<p>1. gold-diggers (in case of rich Blacks)- although, why soil all your life with someone extremely alien- physically, mentally, emotionally &hellip;And your progeny is as different as imaginable.</p>
<p>2. perversions - women who prefer Blacks are in the good company of S&M;, bestiality addicts, pedophiles etc.</p>
<p>3. plain stupidity..? NO, no one can can be just THAT stupid.     </p>

		<p>Amazing how many posters here think that black men lusting after white women is no big deal or that it is just natural. Not threatened by it at all. Shows the degree to which the diversity brain washing has succeeded. And on a white racial interest web site to boot. Unbelievable. There was a time in this country when black men respected if not feared white men enough to leave white women alone. They kept their behavior in check. Now according to the Dept of Justice crime stats some 34,000 white females are raped by blacks. Is that just natural too?</p>

<p>2. imperialism paradigm is not enough. Simply, European white people are more diverse &amp; attractive: hair- brown, red, black, blonde, ..eyes- hazel, black, blue, brown, gray, green, ..Culture-wise, Asians have always been much more influenced by European art-forms than vice versa: Buddha sculptures from NW India some 2 centuries B.C. showing decisively influence of Hellenistic art; Tagore&rsquo;s novels (hey, novels) &amp; poetry; Philo Judaeus&rsquo; assimilation of Platonism (essentially, all Jewish &amp; Islamic medieval philosophy are Plotinus &amp; Aristotle refurbished); Ottoman Turkish fascination with Venetian painting (Bellini&rsquo;s portrait of Sultan Mehmed II); privileged status of White- mainly Slavic &amp; Germanic - women in Sultan&rsquo;s harem (Roxelana); &hellip;..</p>
<p>White men chasing East Asian women has more to do with fetishistic sexuality &amp; other factors (economic, social,..) than with standards of female beauty.   </p>

<p>True. I even read on some message board a few years ago a statement by some poster that a friend of his who worked at an adult store told him that BM-WF p-rn is watched almost entirely by white men. Black men, despite what one might expect, prefer same-race p-rn, whether featuring blacks or whites.</p>
<p>Despite the impression one gets from seeing BM-WF couples, white women are, in my experience, far more sensible than white men. It&rsquo;s just that the majority of black women are hideous, which artificially depresses BW-WM pairing (and inflates BM-WF). Attractive black women with great personalities don&rsquo;t seem to have any problems whatsoever with white men, from what I&rsquo;ve observed!</p>
<p>In addition, I should point out that I haven&rsquo;t noticed a whole lot of white women with black men anyway. Does it happen? Yes, of course. But do white women as a whole prefer black men over white men? Certainly not. And those who do tend to have mental problems and/or are left-wing Marxist fanatics like Obama&rsquo;s mother. The fraction of white women who prefer black men is about the same as those who prefer other women!</p>

<p>Thats your pregorative, not mine.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;Jewish men- if they can afford it- are obsessed with blonde &ldquo;shiksas&rdquo;. Read Philip Roth. Also, although not much of a science: <a href="https://goo.gl/s3kmo" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/s3kmo&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Absolute balderdash! Fact: Roth talks only about a section of Askhenaz Jewish men settled in the west ( living under Euroceteric norms where white/blonde is artificially pumped up as the faux-gold standard). Obviously, this rather small percentage of westernized Jewish men are only assimilating to the norm to garner success, ditto with any non white group in the west. Success &amp; status comes with winning the gold standard set by the host as a norm. However, the vast majority of Jewish men prefer the archetypal tanned dark haired, brown eyed high IQ witty Jewish dream girl. This only proves my point! In fact in Israel, the hottest female star and sex symbols are brunettes with middle eastern features, despite the presence of Nordic models &amp; celebs there.</p>
<p>For example, even today the epitome of Jewish/ Israeli beauty is a dark complexioned Shiri Mamon, Natalie Portman and Alison Brie. The blonde haired blue eyed white skinned Israeli supermodels Esti Ginzburg &amp; Bar Raffaeli are outscored by the aforementioned brunettes in terms of beauty &amp; femininity.</p>
<p>2. Western civilization has in many ways been deeply influenced by Asiatic cultures, the best example is Christianity - a religion whose progenitor was a dark skinned olive brown complexioned black haired brown eyed Semitic west Asiatic Galilean. The last time I checked, Asians are following their own norms &amp; cultures - not some European imported one.</p>
<p>Beauty is purely subjective. Many non white men are repulsed with blonde Nordic looks &amp; the vice versa may be true in some cases. But as evolution will support my view: men of a certain race will ALWAYS for the most part find their own women more attractive. And judging the stats: Asian women seem to beat white women in terms of getting more dates especially by white men. Thailand is a great example of millions of white men traveling half way around the world to seek Asian women. Show me ONE place in the western world where non whites pour in to seek Nordic women? Not one place&hellip;.the closest would be Amsterdam - but even there, you will find a plethora of middle eastern, Slavic, Nordic and Asiatic women scoring the game! And Amsterdam would pale in comparison to Thailand.</p>

<p>You are dead wrong! If I were to take the sum total of the sexual interests of the world&rsquo;s men: the preference for blondes would be a tiny minority! Fact is, most men of a certain race prefer a woman of similar genetic heritage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled around the world to some of the most interesting places - India, Japan, Israel, China, Turkey, Israel, Iran, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Egypt, Jordan etc. The fact most men of these nations idealized the perfect epitome of beauty as someone who racially resembled them. Thus in India, the archetypal Bollywood dream girl is a fair skinned ( light brown/ light olive complexioned NOT pale scaly European white), dark eyed, dark haired beauty with a medical or engineering degree and wealth. Look at the movie industries in India ( the world&rsquo;s largest movie industry) - ALL Indians NO room for whites ( even though they have many desperate aspiring blonde blue eyed wannabe stars from countries like the UK, Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, and even a few from Australia &amp; the United States)</p>

<p>An interesting article of how Indians look down on white women as inferior in general: Note- I don&rsquo;t espouse what they think.</p>

<p>In Israel ( the perfect Jewish dream girl is a wealthy, well educated intelligent dark haired, brown eyed fair skinned ( olive complexioned as opposed to black skin or pale scaly Nordic complexion) woman is ideal. Eg: Yael Abikasis is considered the epitome of Israeli/Jewish beauty by the vast majority of Israeli Jews.</p>
<p>https://israelity.com/2007/06/27/ideal-beauty/ </p>
<p><br>
In China &amp; Japan - the lead movie stars are ALL without an exception oriental looking. In the Arab world, Arab women are considered the epitome of beauty. </p>
<p>Top rated Japanese beauties in their movie industry:</p>
<p><a href="https://sabrebiade.hubpages.com/hub/Japanese-Actresses" rel="nofollow">https://sabrebiade.hubpages.com/hub/Japanese-Actresses</a></p>
<p>Likewise in Australia: the majority of the population is Nordic ( English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, German etc) that would explain why Aussie men love blondes. Blondes are considered the epitome of beauty in Australia, North America ( except Mexico where olive complexioned Latin-Spaniard Mediterranean women flank the #1 spot) and Western Europe.</p>
<p><br>
This only proves my point: in each of these nations, the ideal woman is someone who belongs to the same ethno-racial stock. Western media has the highest outreach in the world, thanks to tons of Satellites in space ( &gt; 95% from the United States alone)- that explains why American aka Nordic ideals of beauty seem so omnipotent in TV channels and entertainment. But does that in anyway reflect the REAL ideals of the vast majority of non western men? NO!</p>
<p>The dating sites you quote are ALL western (American, European or Australian based) dating sites. Ofcourse, they ARE going to promote their own Euro-centric aesthetic view to beauty. If I were to goto an Indian, Jewish, Japanese, Arab or Chinese website : the hottest hits would be on the attractive females of their own respective ethnicity and NOT those fictitious blondes that you imagine. Btw, I&rsquo;m a Jewish man myself and I do not find white Europeans / blondes / red heads in anywhere as attractive as Jewish women. Evolution designed a species to propagate it&rsquo;s own kind. Thus evolution also designed the mutual attraction that naturally occurs intra-spieces and NOT inter-spieces. That is why I am against race-mixing. It is NOT natural. </p>
<p>This is what American Renaissance is about - white ethno-racial nationalism. Amren makes more sense than other white supremacist sites because it does NOT advocate supremacy. Jared Taylor, popular Youtube blogger RAMZPAUL etc are the more intelligent &amp; rational men who promote nationalism and NOT supremacism ( which is bound to failure&hellip;cough Nazism..cough cough)</p>

		<p>Your observations are simply tainted by your own biases. Blond women come on top no matter how you look at it. By the way I have been to every country you listed and a lot more. In India for example the only reason they do not use blondes is for their own self respect. Instead they sneak brown haired Whites and try to pass them off as Indians. It is so bad their was almost a strike about it about six months ago.As far as Israel why are they one of the leading White slave countries in the world. Guess who they bring almost exclusively East European blondes. That is a fact. I also find it interesting that you bring up Israel when it&rsquo;s population is a drop in the bucket. However to the Israel centrics out there, who I believe you are one, thinks Israel is the only country that matters. What about all of Latin Americans, Blondes again. Arabs, Blonds again. It goes on and on. Sorry Middle Eastern women generally do not have symmetric features.  That is what scientists have found what makes a person good looking.</p>

		<p><i>The blonde haired blue eyed white skinned Israeli supermodels Esti Ginzburg &amp; Bar Raffaeli are outscored by the aforementioned brunettes in terms of beauty &amp; femininity.</i></p>
<p>Says who?</p>
<p>You write this and then contradict yourself:</p>
<p><i>Beauty is purely subjective.</i></p>
<p>You are correct here, your first proclamation is laughable.  Dark haired women with straight black or brown hair, dark skin and black or brown eyes are a dime a dozen on this earth.  White men marry White women 97% of the time.</p>
<p>Why do so many Asian women seek plastic surgery to alter their eyes and facial structure to look more White?  I don&rsquo;t know of ONE plastic surgery clinic here in the West that cater to White women to make them look more Asian (or Jewish for that matter).  I know of no hair salon that specifically dyes blond or red hair black so as to look more Asian   &mdash;   yet the reverse is very common, Asian salons also commonly &#8220;blond&#8221; Asian hair.</p>
<p>Dark haired women are a dime a dozen.  Blondes and red-heads are rare.</p>
<p><i>.And judging the stats: Asian women seem to beat white women in terms of getting more dates especially by white men.</i></p>
<p>Which &#8220;stats&#8221; might those be?  </p>
<p><i>Thailand is a great example of millions of white men traveling half way around the world to seek Asian women.</i></p>
<p>Because they THROW themselves at White men.  A lot of those &#8220;millions of White men&#8221; traveling through Asians countries are seeking young boys, also readily available in Asia. How many come back with Thai wives?  Millions and millions?  Ridiculous.</p>
<p><i>And Amsterdam would pale in comparison to Thailand.</i></p>
<p>I know of not one White male that has sought a wife in Thailand.  I know several Jewish men, however, who have married Filipino or Chinese wives, including the dragon lady &#8220;Tiger Mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you come here to tell White women how ugly and undesirable they are?  I could say the same thing about Jewish women whom I&rsquo;ve found to be loud, foul-mouthed and arrogant.  </p>
<p>Let me ask you this:</p>
<p>Why do so many Jewish men marry out?  Why is the out-marriage rage about 50%?  If so many White women are, as you claim, undesirable, if not repulsive, even to White men, why do so many Jewish men find White women so attractive?<br>
Why don&rsquo;t Jewish men find their own women attractive? Could it be that Jewish women ARE unattractive, loud and foul-mouthed?</p>

<p>Is that why you&rsquo;re here, to support White ethno-nationalism?</p>
<p>If not, then why are you here?</p>
<p><i>(which is bound to failure&hellip;cough Nazism..cough cough).</i></p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s always about the Nazis, isn&rsquo;t it?   Unlike the ADL, SPLC, LaRaza, NAACP, who are allowed to gather in peace to support and promote their respective ethno-nationalities, anytime Whites gather it is always considered by the media and SPLC to be &#8220;A Rise of White Supremacists fomenting a Fourth Reich.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Including AR, which is constantly called a White supremacist site and hate group by the likes of the SPLC and ADL.</p>
<p>SPLC:  <i>In his personal bearing and tone, Jared Taylor projects himself as a courtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist.</i> </p>
<p>ADL:  <i>The journal (AR), which Taylor edits, promotes pseudoscientific studies that attempt to demonstrate the intellectual and cultural superiority of whites</i></p>

		<p>I have to agree with Aaron from Rhode Island here.  Too many posters on AmRen seem to be obsessed with that blond/blue eyes combo when the overwhelming majority of White adults are actually brunettes of all eye colors.  Sorry to break it to you, but most next door and famous blonde women are fake blondes in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed (e.g: Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte Bardot, Farrah Fawcett, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, etc,).  </p>
<p>Moreover, it is the unique facial symmetry of White women that Non-Whites are actually attracted to (sparkling eyes, softer hair, smaller nose, smoother jaw lines and cheekbones).  That&rsquo;s what makes Caucasian women from the Baltic to the Mediterranean Sea the most feminine and beautiful in the world.  Lighter hair color is irrelevant when a White woman is already naturally attractive, and it is nothing more than a cosmetic enhancer just like lipstick and mascara.  </p>
<p>I mean last time I checked, most of those gorgeous White female stars, top models as well as Miss World and Universe winners aren&rsquo;t Nordic blondes at all.  It&rsquo;s about the beautiful shape of our features folks, and color has nothing to do with it: <a href="https://goo.gl/ykYtg" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/ykYtg</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether your contention is true or not.  But I think almost everyone who posts at AR, me included, wants it to be true.  We want a black man to look at a white woman and constantly see the the ugliest and most grotesque person he has ever laid eyes on, then look at black women and see the ne plus ultra of beauty and femininity.  Likewise, we want white men to look at Asian women and see the worst looking people on Earth, then look at white women and see the gold standard of female humanity.</p>
<p>A hint that you just might be right is myself.  As my personal odometer accumulates a few miles, and I stop thinking in terms of marital fantasy and start thinking in terms of reality, thinking about the sort of woman who I will probably wind up marrying, here in the real world, I have come to the conclusion that she will be:  (1) White, obviously, (2) Physically average overall, but having or or two above average physical attributes, and (3) A great conversationalist, a borderline polymath, someone whom I can take to a friendly debating society as much as to bed, (We&rsquo;ll talk dirty to each other about Thucydides, judicial precedents, Samuel Johnson and differential equations, in order to get each other in the mood), IQ at least 130, preferably at least 140.   Then I realized, OMG, I want to marry myself with different plumbing.</p>
<p>Maybe egomaniacsism is one more trait I have to ditch with age.</p>
<p>Honestly, though, given the exact same physical attributes, the smarter the woman is, the more physical attractive she looks to me.</p>

<p>Any evidence for your rather unlettered non factual claim? I have provided ample evidence to support my argument which is based on raw facts. Maybe some white posters here are too deluded to handle the truth. The &#8220;blonde blue eyed is the best&#8221; fantasy is about as deluded as those blacks who claim they are the true descendents of Israel or that Afro-centrist WD Fard (founder of the black supremacist organization: Nation of Islam) claiming that all whites were created by a mad black &#8220;scientist&#8221; in a lab. And that blacks are the true original people of the world!</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;As far as Israel why are they one of the leading White slave countries in the world. Guess who they bring almost exclusively East European blondes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Btw, most Eastern European Slavs are NOT blondes ( non Nordic people)&hellip;.in fact many Ashkhenaz Jews are more Nordic looking than most Slavs. So your point is???? </p>
<p>&#8221; That is a fact. I also find it interesting that you bring up Israel when it&rsquo;s population is a drop in the bucket. However to the Israel centrics out there, who I believe you are one, thinks Israel is the only country that matters. What about all of Latin Americans, Blondes again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latin American &#8220;blondes&#8221; with the exception of Gsielle Bundchen ( Brazil) do not fare anywhere close to tanned Spaniard Mediterranean dark haired /brown eyed beauties who dominate the movie industry &amp; modelling - just look at Telanova / Telemundo or any other major Mexican Tv channel.</p>
<p> &#8220;Arabs, Blonds again. It goes on and on. Sorry Middle Eastern women generally do not have symmetric features. That is what scientists have found what makes a person good looking&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, NO evidence but more baseless propaganda which entirely false. In fact even in the Arab world ( of which as you may know, I&rsquo;m no big fan) - the symmetrical Arab women are the epitome of beauty. And as a matter of fact, many Arab women are far better looking than even your best plastic blonde Nordics:</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/U32JZ</p>
<p>As I stated before, its a matter of individual taste!</p>
<p>To Phil:</p>
<p>&#8220;Semitic preferences for blondes go back to the middle ages, at least. Read some Bernard Lewis, sometimes, its your brand of &ldquo;conservatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernard Lewis talking about Jewish preference for blondes? Really. I&rsquo;m well versed with Lewis&rsquo; work. He is an English Jew himself. I&rsquo;ve read ALL his works and cannot recollect any such balderdash! The sex trafficking is by the Red Mafia run by white Russian mafia ( non Jewish ethnic Russians for the most part. Yes they do have a small tiny percentile of Russian Jews, BUT, the list would also include Ethnic white gentile Lithuanians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Latvians, Belorussians etc.)<br>
Therefore the sex trade cannot be termed as an Israeli or even Jewish venture - it is primarily Ethnic Russian and Eastern European.</p>

		<p>Aaron is practicing for his LSAT, he clearly couldn&rsquo;t cut it in anything that required hard manual labor or the rigors of consistency such as mathematics. </p>
<p>The idea that Slavs (non-Jews) are living in Israel, pimping their women to other Slavs (or poor unsuspecting Jews) In Israel is an idea worthy to be accepted by a lobotomized zombie. I guess the &#8220;law of return&#8221; goes for everyone from the North now, just as long as they aren&rsquo;t indigenous Semites.</p>
<p>Bernard Lewis illustrated that Arabs (Semitic) in the Middle Ages paid much higher prices for blonde sex slaves than for other races.</p>
<p>Is Bernard Lewis credible? Maybe not a lot, but more so than Freud, Einstein, or Marx. I consider him quote worthy.</p>
<p>Plus females like Bar Rafaeli seem to prefer Nordic looking males, even when their society is prejudiced against their choices.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m kind of agnostic on the issue. But a few things:</p>
<p>1. Women the world over lighten their hair.</p>
<p>2. The top Bollywood actresses are basically white. In other words, if you did not hear an accent and they were just walking down the street you would think they were whites. </p>
<p>3. In Asia (including India) ads for dating websites and wives often request &#8220;fair skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. Look at the wives of many Arab dictators. Araft, Assad, the guy from Jordan &hellip;etc all married blondes and have sons who are white.</p>
<p>5. Skin bleaching creams are big business.</p>
<p>6. Univision has more white actors and actresses - including blondes - than U.S. TV. This is not said as a joke. Turn it on right now. Do you see a mestizo, a black or a white person on the screen?</p>
<p>7. Who do all the leaders in Latin America marry? Sure, you can say most of the leaders are white men so they just marry white women. But look at the wives of the mestizo leaders (like Chavez) as well.</p>
<p>8. Across Asia, white models (male and female) are the rage.</p>
<p>9. Rich men in Arab and Asian countries do import white women for parties, harems &hellip;etc. They pay quite a lot of money to do this as well.</p>
<p>Of course, I do agree that beauty is subjective. My own preference is for olive skin though I am very pale. </p>
<p>And Aaron from Rhode Island seems to be conflating blondes and whites. Most whites are not blondes.</p>
