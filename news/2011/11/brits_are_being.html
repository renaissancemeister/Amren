	<p>An outspoken councillor claims white British people are being ignored as a result of the efforts to help Southend&rsquo;s ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Ian Robertson, a Tory councillor for Chalkwell, fears &#8220;ghettos&#8221; will be created due to the emphasis on aiding ethnic groups.</p>
<p>He made his point after hearing a talk by community activist John Barber, at the latest meeting of the Chalkwell Ward Residents&rsquo; Association.</p>
<p>Mr Barber, from Southend Community in Harmony, revealed how ethnic minority groups had more than doubled in Southend since 2001  &mdash;  and these communities needed more help and guidance.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I have worked for Turning Tides which helps the disadvantaged in wards like Milton, Kursaal and Victoria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to energise and lift up the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing we realised was we need a more powerful Zimbabwe community association in the town to address issues they face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some are asylum seekers and some are economic migrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;They face issues of cultural adaptation and issues of trauma. We encourage them so they can find the appropriate means of rectifying these situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added how a study looking at the ethnicity of school children strongly suggested numbers from overseas were &#8220;growing year on year&#8221;.</p>
<p>However Mr Robertson questioned whether groups, such as Mr Barber&rsquo;s, were actually doing enough to help the indigenous population  &mdash;  and they could, in fact, be making matters worse by isolating ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;You haven&rsquo;t once mentioned the British community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am concerned we have to be very careful not to create little ghettos. I am concerned we are going to lose focus on the British community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Barber replied by saying the majority of homeless people in Southend were white British who received just as much help from community groups.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;The Zimbabwean community very much wants to engage in all society, and, in fact, they want to help and support us, not the other way round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier Mr Barber had told the meeting how a latest study estimated that in 2001 just seven per cent of the Southend population was ethnic, compared to between 14 and 16 per cent now.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;What we are finding in recent years is the population in Southend is increasing because of an influx of Eastern Europeans, particularly the Polish who could number as many as 2,000 along with other Europeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have a Fillipino population, many of whom were recruited by Southend Hospital and besides them we also have people from every part of Africa, particularly Zimbabwe.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Why should an economic migrant from Zimbabwe which rejected white civilisation in 1979, be coddled by the country he or she rejected?  Let these &#8216;economic migrants&rsquo; A.K.A. parasites upon Western civilisation live on plundered white farms which without white nous are wastelands.</p>

		<p>So Zimbaweans massacred the White population of Rhodesia, then ran that country into the ground&hellip;then in response they came to White country and we are expected that they have gotten over their lust for White blood and are actually now in Brittain to HELP them? Oh&hellip;really?</p>
<p>What breathtaking idiocy!</p>

		<p>How funny !! I used to work in the housing section on the council two situations stick in my mind.</p>
<p>Ethnic tenant - We could prove that he was being given a council house with full benefits (i.e free rent and unemployment payments) while (you all sitting down ?) owned 3 houses in Kent and 2 Indian takeaways in Southend End. Numerous (and I mean numerous) reports to fraud section resulted in zero action against him.</p>
<p>British white guy (elderly) claims benefits and then went out to see his dying brother who was currently living in a Canadian province. He claimed his benefits longer than he should have, an accident that HE brought the council attention when he returned.</p>
<p>Hell was brought upon him,threats of prosecution etc etc     </p>
