			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Celock, Huffington Post, November 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is promising to press several controversial immigration measures when the state legislature reconvenes in January.</p>
<p>Having made immigration his signature issue, Kobach told the <em>Lawrence Journal-World</em>, that he wants the legislature to take up several immigration-related measures in the next session. This includes a bill similar to the controversial Arizona immigration measure he helped write, which allows police officers to detain individuals they believe may be undocumented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the reasons is that there is just so much demand for it from constituents,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Also, he said, an e-Verify bill that has failed in the past in the Kansas Legislature is more likely to gain acceptance because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May that upheld an Arizona law that requires employers use the E-Verify database system to check the immigration status of their workers.</p>
<p>During the 2011 session, legislation similar to another Arizona anti-illegal immigration law, and a bill to repeal in-state tuition for some undocumented students, was under consideration. Kobach has been a driving force behind both measures.</p>

		<p>I hope Kobach can engineer a super majority victory for this legislation in the Kansas legislature, because I fully expect Gov. Samnesty Brownback to veto.  Brownback is on record as hating white people.</p>

		<p>They aren&rsquo;t kidding.  Kobach has been the driving force behind this, and he isn&rsquo;t lying about the push from constituents.  Even open-borders Brownback is taking a back-step in the debate because Kansans are fed up with illegal immigration.  It makes no sense to ignore your own laws because foreigners who would so openly break said laws call you racist.</p>
<p>But of course to the HuffPost this is &#8220;controversial.&#8221;  When 65%+ of people want more immigration enforcement (it&rsquo;s closer to 80% of citizens), it&rsquo;s controversial.  When under 40% of people want something like Obamacare, it is hailed as &#8220;landmark&#8221; and &#8220;historic.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Great news. And this is where we have to concentrate our efforts at the state and local level - to get principled local leaders in positions like State Secretary of State. Teddy Roosevelt started a full fledged war against Spain as the &#8220;Assistant Secretary of the Navy&#8221; - we need to get our guys in these types of positions. The money power, media power, corrupt Republicrat parties can fix things at the top, not so at lower levels.</p>
<p>Think locally, act locally - NIMBY - accept of course if White folks are attempting too promote Amren style White nationalism - then that&rsquo;s fine for your back yard.</p>

		<p>Brownback needs to be taken out in the next primary.  That would send a strong message to the GOP.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m personally taking a tiny bit of credit for Kobach&rsquo;s successes.  While he is a Kansan, his last paying job before becoming Kansas Secretary of State, and the one he held while helping to author Arizona SB 1070, was a Law Professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.  So I helped pay his salary at the time.</p>

		<p>The latest telephone poll directed by Rick Perry, the Texas Governor, asked whether people who live in Texas think illegal immigration is a serious problem:</p>
<p>29% responded, &#8220;Yes, it is a serious problem.&#8221;<br>
71% responded, &#8220;No es problema.&#8221;</p>
