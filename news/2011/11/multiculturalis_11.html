<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=365357">Multiculturalism and the End of White America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pat Buchanan, World Net Daily, November 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In three weeks of my radio-TV tour to promote &#8220;The Suicide of a Superpower,&#8221; no question has occurred more often than one about the chapter &#8220;The End of White America.&#8221; Invariably, the question boils down to this:</p>
<p>Why should we care if white Americans become a minority? America, interviewers remind me, assimilated the immigrants of a century ago  &mdash;  Italians, Poles, Jews, Slavs  &mdash;  and we can do the same with peoples from the Third World.</p>
<p>And perhaps they are right. {snip}</p>
<p>Yet there are reasons to worry.</p>
<p>First, the great American Melting Pot has been rejected by our elites as cultural genocide, in favor of a multiculturalism that is failing in Europe. Second, what we are attempting has no precedent in human history.</p>
<p>We are attempting to convert a republic, European and Christian in its origins and character, into an egalitarian democracy of all the races, religions, cultures and tribes of planet Earth.</p>
<p>We are turning America into a gargantuan replica of the U.N. General Assembly, a continental conclave of the most disparate and diverse peoples in all of history, who will have no common faith, no common moral code, no common language and no common culture.</p>
<p>What, then, will hold us together? A Constitution over whose meaning we have fought for 50 years?</p>
<p>Consider the contrasts between the old and new immigration. Where the total of immigrants in the &#8220;Great Wave&#8221; from 1890 to 1920 numbered 15 to 20 million, today there are 40 million here.</p>
<p>In 1924, the United States declared a timeout on all immigration. But for almost half a century since 1965, there has been no timeout. One to 2 million more immigrants, legal and illegal, arrive every year.</p>
<p>Where the old immigrants all came from Europe, the new are overwhelmingly people of color. But America has never had the same success in assimilating peoples of color.</p>
<p>The Indians we fought for centuries live on reservations. And if we did not succeed with a few million Native Americans, what makes us think we will succeed in assimilating 135 million Hispanics who will be here in 2050, scores of millions of Indian ancestry?</p>
<p>We have encountered immense difficulty, including a civil war, to bring black Americans, who have been here longer than any immigrant group, into full participation in our society.</p>
<p>This was a failing the last two generations have invested immense effort and enormous wealth to correct. But we cannot deny the difficulty of the problem when, 50 years after the civil-rights revolution, one yet hears daily the accusation of &#8220;racist!&#8221; on our TV channels and in our political discourse.</p>
<p>Ought we not first solve the problem of fully integrating people of color, before bringing in tens of millions more?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here, again, are but a few of the differences between the old and new immigration:</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s numbers are twice as large. Where the old immigration stopped after 30 years, ours never ends.</p>
<p>Where the old immigrants were Europeans, today&rsquo;s are Third World people who have never been fully assimilated by any Western country. Where those arrived from Christian nations, many of today&rsquo;s come from a civilization that battled Christianity for 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Where Western powers ruled the world in 1920, today the West is aging and dying, and much of the world is on fire with anti-white and anti-Western resentment of 500 years of European domination.</p>
<p>In 1920, Western people were nearly one-third of mankind. Today, Western man is down to one-sixth of the world&rsquo;s population, shrinking to one-eighth by 2050, and not a tenth by century&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>When did the American people assent to our taking this risk with their republic?</p>

		<p>Being election day, we teachers had professional development day.  I sat with five other teachers who teach my subject.  I am happy to report, that rather than listen with rapt attention to all the social justice gobbeldygook that we are usually fed, our table had an excellent discussion about how education these days is nothing more than an anti-white tirade.  Every teacher at my table (2 white females, 1 Arab female, and two white males) agreed that marxism is the basis of the &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and &#8216;open borders&rsquo; movement.  And all of us were against those things!  There are still many true-seeing teachers out there, we just don&rsquo;t know we are so many.</p>

		<p>Buchanan has stood his ground, and has remained staunch in his principles. Thus he could never be president. At this point, that office requires a moral elasticity our Jesuit-trained friend does not have. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about 3/4ths finished with his book. Nothing on the subject of race he mentions wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in &#8220;White Identity.&#8221; If MSNBC decides to fire him however, perhaps they can replace him with the Iranian President, Ahmahnijad; that is, assumimg Columbia U has not yet given him tenure. I can see it now in floodlights: MSNBC Presents the Sharpton-Ahmahninijad Hour. </p>

		<p>Anon #2: &#8220;Being election day, we teachers had professional development day. I sat with five other teachers who teach my subject &hellip; Our table had an excellent discussion about how education these days is nothing more than an anti-white tirade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more than an anti-white tirade&#8221; is not an exaggeration:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning in the early 1980s &hellip; the most effective way to upgrade the status of students whose academic performance in school had barely changed &hellip; was not so much to enhance it positively through celebratory readings but to reduce the moral and cultural status of the mainstream. To do so, they [educators] began to load the history and literature curriculum with literary works &hellip; that stressed the flaws and failings of the United States &hellip; Although this literature became known facetiously as &lsquo;victim lit&rsquo; or &lsquo;white-guilt lit&rsquo; for its highlighting of a group&rsquo;s victimization by white Americans, many teachers believed it was useful precisely because it served to elevate a minority group&rsquo;s moral status &hellip; and create guilt in white students &hellip;&rdquo; (Losing Our Language: How Multicultural Classroom Instruction is Undermining Our Children&rsquo;s Ability to Read, Write, and Reason, by Sandra Stotsky, 1999, p49) </p>
<p>In Losing our Language, Professor Stotsky, then a Research Associate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, examined &ldquo;the contents of the leading readers for grades 4 and 6 published in 1993 and 1995.&rdquo; Five years later, in The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003), research professor Diane Ravitch would reveal how textbook publishers efficiently generate the required content for the new approach. Their key instrument: comically elaborate &ldquo;bias and sensitivity guidelines&rdquo;  &mdash;  some of which, with great difficulty, Ravitch was able to obtain. Below is her description of the guidelines of publishing giant McGraw-Hill: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The MH guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo;  say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo;  European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (p44) <br>
My favorite example, though, of the exquisite sensitivity of the textbook and testing industry to the ideological demands of selling to school systems is an incident Ravitch shared about her 1998 service on the National Assessment Governing Board, the supervisory body for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Ravitch, a Clinton appointee, worked on a subcommittee tasked to review fourth grade reading passages intended for what would have become a voluntary national test: <br>
&ldquo;After I had read about a dozen such passages, a combination of fiction and nonfiction, I realized that the readings themselves had a cumulative subtext: the hero was never a white boy. Instead, the leading character  &mdash;  the one who was most competent, successful, and sympathetic  &mdash;  was invariably either a girl (of any race) or a nonwhite boy. Almost without exception, white boys were portrayed as weak and dependent. In one story, a white boy in a difficult situation weeps and says plaintively, &lsquo;If only my big sister were here, I would know what to do.&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Education After the Culture Wars,&rdquo; Daedalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Summer, 2002) </p>

		<p>&#8220;In the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races, which, like Hesiod&rsquo;s, are of gold and silver and brass and iron. And so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps human nature has changed since Socrates&rsquo; day. I guess we get to find out.</p>

		<p>#19: It is up to every one of us to inform our families, friends, Neighbors, and work associates. It is too important not to.</p>
<p>Most people stare at me in disbelief when I tell them the statistics of crime, welfare, and its abuse, Illegal Aliens taking their jobs away, while soaking our Heathcare system, etc.</p>
<p>Remember, there is a tremendous amount of information to go through, all while trying to make sense out of all of it.</p>
<p>There is so much information that the average person with a job and a family hardly has enough time to come home from work and have their dinner, and all the rest that they need to do, much less focus any real attention on these pressing matters.</p>
<p>Our political and cultural adversaries are also attacking us from all sides, so it is really impossible to keep up with every affront to our traditional culture, and threat to our way of life, other than by reading every email that is sent to you on the various subjects. But who has the time for that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they count on; ignorance from the people of the traditional American culture. No one can make a sound argument for or against something, if they do not have all of the facts.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is imperative that people such as yourself hand out printed aticles, or web site addresses, for your family, friends, and others, to read and learn from. </p>

<p>Of course the answer is simple; when a nation&rsquo;s people host over a very small percentage of immigrants they develop enclaves that are fairly permanent.  This was manageable, even desirable when they were Europeans, even Eastern Europeans, because America reflected Europe, which is what the Founding Fathers mean when they describes a melting pot.  (They couldn&rsquo;t have imagined having every tribal group in the world here with their religion and quaint cultures because it is a logistical and legal quagmire to start with)!  But more important is resisting the very idea of assimilation.  Who said we wanted to marry into Hispanic hordes?  Because that is what &#8220;assimilation&#8221; ultimately implies.  As long as it happens in very limited incidents the genetic drift is negligible.  But once it begins to happen on the sort of scale we see today, we are truly talking about racial extinction.</p>

		<p>The simple indisputable fact is that moderninity as we know it is entirely the creation of Western Europe and her American descendants.  Modern technology, political development and thought, the arts, literature, the modern state are all the product of western thought and invention.</p>
<p>One can make the argument quite reasonably that the West made some essential breakthroughs in political thought that rendered all this possible and that given a bit more time and experimentation these developments would have come about elsewhere as well.  Perhaps, but the fact is that it happened in the West first. This much is pretty much indisputable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that East Asia in particular is catching up and even surpassing us in some ways, particularly in the area of advanced manufacturing.  And there&rsquo;s no doubting the intellect and inventiveness of certain other races either, but the fact is that Western man started the ball rolling, whether through a sheer accident of history or some unique intellectual properties of the white race. Or perhaps a combination of both.  </p>

		<p>Ironically, it was soft-headed conservatives like Hannity who kept asking Buchanan about this so-called controversy.  Thankfully, Pat didn&rsquo;t back down  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m glad he wrote what he did.  Frankly, this is the pure and unbridled truth that white conservatives will all come to realize.  If you think statism is bad today, just think of what it will be like when natural collectivists either from foreign lands or our inner cities get to dictate more and more of American policy.</p>
<p>Eliminate immigration from all non-white nations and we will see a more prosperous and peaceful America.</p>

<p> Ummmmm, how many people even TRY?  One of the main effects of anti-White bias is to silence Whites and make them think that no one else feels that way.  Of course when one speaks up one may not be successful, but most people will suffer far less ill consequences than they fear.</p>
<p>Sure the <i>New York Times</i> is not going to come out with the headline, &#8220;Multiculturalism Ruins Society,&#8221; because of a brilliant argument you have made, but they are not going to come out with a headline saying &#8220;Joe Averageguy Is a Racist&#8221; either.  If they are pros they are not even going to say &#8220;Jared Taylor Is a Racist&#8221; -– people would Google it and start reading AR.</p>

		<p>Segregation is the solution: racial, religious, and language based separation of all the world&rsquo;s people; after all, the little phrase &#8220;good fences make good neighbors&#8221; contains more wisdom than all the platitudes in the United Nations&rsquo; entire library. It turns out &#8220;prejudice&#8221; and &#8220;bigotry&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;sectarianism&#8221; are actually the answers, and not the problems. </p>

		<p>Time to rip the mask off so-called &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; and call it what it really is, &#8220;multi-racialism.&#8221;  Kicking and screaming against multiculturalism is to shadow-box with the real thing, multi-racialism.  That is the goal of the ultras, not some sticky, gummy multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Admitting we are caught up in a drive for multi-racialism offers several ways to analyze and understand what is really going on, and it offers a new way to analyze the morality of how the diverse white American peoples need to conduct themselves. </p>

		<p>&#8220;A few years ago I visited a shopping mall in Santa Monica. I asked the security guard for directions to Radio Shack. He refused to answer in English. Harbinger.&#8221;</p>
<p>He probably did not refuse. He probably did not know a word of English. If he was under 5&rsquo;4 he probably did not know more than 50 words of Spanish because he was an indian recruited right out of his stone age village.</p>
<p>I remember going into a Santa Monica CVS in a pouring rain.  I had an umbrella.  I heard a barking sound.  I looked around and saw what I thought was a 10 or 11 year old boy sort of barking at me.</p>
<p>The cashier said, &#8220;he wants you to put the umbrella in one of the buckets.&#8221;  Then I saw the store had plastic buckets so the umbrellas would not drip water all over.  The 4&rsquo;9 person who was barking was some sort of tiny little indian speaking his indian language working as a security guard.</p>
<p>I could have walked out with 3 or 4 shopping carts filled with stolen goods and he could not have stopped me.  Nor would he have been able to call the police.</p>
<p>There are plenty of homeless native born Americans in Santa Monica who could use his minimum wage job and sec 8 apartment.</p>
<p>Perhaps the company he works for got him on an H-1b visa as someone with such unique and essential skills that they could not find an American  to fill the job.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how your asserted all white nation might be achieved.  It&rsquo;s not likely that whites in North America could somehow move out all non-whites, or somehow eliminate them.  It is not that likely that a state within North America would arise and last very long since it would be isolated much like SA was during apartheid.  So that isn&rsquo;t likely to occur without a preceding collapse of not just America, North America or the West, but a worldwide collapse and its development after a time (a long period) of chaos and destruction.  I don&rsquo;t think that many could predict what sort of culture or humanity would survive to that point.  Then, we have the idea of Europe re-establishing white only populations.  This seems like a more likely proposition, but since Europe is part of a larger continent full of non-whites and vulnerable to Africa, it also would be forced to contend with the likely less cooperative non-whites near it.  Again,it appears that only a world collapse would result POSSIBLY in the rise of a white only Europe.  But all sorts of things could happen during that period that could eliminate whites from Europe.  Short term, political whitening of Europe might be tried, but Europe will be struggling with itself over fascism and communism as it long has been.  This could easily lead to new civil wars in Europe, killing off many whites.  As with post war Europe, the non-whites move in.  And we must remember, any significant loss of stability would result in first economic collapse and then civil collapse.  We are seeing the beginning of this in Europe and the U.S, right now.  Australia is an interesting idea, but it has a long way to go in reversing itself at present.</p>
<p>I was just reading up on the antinomian debates this morning.  Christians in Europe were often in sharp debate over this and other questions, and it wasn&rsquo;t only Catholic vs Protestant debate, but an issue within Protestantism where for example Calvinists set against Methodists, vs Quakers, etc.  One of the main reasons for our white civil wars has been Christianity.  I fear that as we might begin to rid ourselves of Muslims, blacks, Hispanics, even Asians, we would once more become our own worst enemies.  </p>
<p>It is my argument that Middle Eastern inspired religions have only caused strife and division in Europe for over two thousand years.  Christianity promised to do that; (Luke 12:43)and has fulfilled that promise at least.  European pre-Christian agrarian based religions served the Europeans for tens of thousands of years and bonded us to the land.  To have any hope of forming a geographic seed of white stability and preservation of white identity on earth, we need to get our heads out of the clouds spiritually.  It is the here and now that counts, not a promise of a hereafter or some vague and constantly pushed back arrival of some imagined white savior set to save white humanity.  Not only is that is massive delusion, there is zero support for it in any religious text.  In the old European traditions, ancestors were venerated.  Just imagine how much this would have affected miscegenation if our religion was largely based on our ancestry?  As for the agrarian aspect, no future people are going to be prosperous without land, and no people will survive long without agricultural knowledge and tradition.  </p>
<p>Today, America&rsquo;s AND the world&rsquo;s farmers are growing old.  No one wants to farm.  Any white who truly intends their own survival or his group, race&rsquo;s survival is going to need agricultural knowledge and practice.  I encourage all race realists to learn to garden, even keep some hens, as I do.  Learn the simple domestic survival skills anew.  I even have a washboard and tub set by.  Things as simple as clean water may become a luxury, as would heat and access to energy sources. Everyone should spend part of their time thinking about things like this and what they mean in the context of any scenario where any new community form is projected, even in theory.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that major challenges are coming.  But if whites only insist on political sporting, re-asserting doctrines that have massively failed us, combined with NFL weekends, etc., you are not being serious and not recognizing the kinds of realities that loom in the near future. I always say that I hope that I am wrong, but it doesn&rsquo;t look likely that I, or any others wherever they weigh in on this subject appear mistaken.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how your asserted all white nation might be achieved. It&rsquo;s not likely that whites in North America could somehow move out all non-whites, or somehow eliminate them. It is not that likely that a state within North America would arise and last very long since it would be isolated much like SA was during apartheid. So that isn&rsquo;t likely to occur without a preceding collapse of not just America, North America or the West, but a worldwide collapse and its development after a time (a long period) of chaos and destruction.

		<p>As the USA feeds on a sexual-harassment frenzy involving Herman Cain, women and the men who love them should pay special attention to the invaluable blog Vlad Tepes where a couple of vital instructional videos are posted today.</p>
<p>One is a harrowing half-hour report on &ldquo;gang grooming&rdquo; in Britain (I&rsquo;m still shaking). This apparently decade-old, predominantly Pakistani practice of &ldquo;grooming&rdquo; very young, predominantly native British girls as sexual props for personal and business (prostitutional) use has now reached epidemic proportions. (The narrative attempts to portray the EDL and the BNP as villains for speaking out about the predominantly Pakistani identity of the rapists and criminals involved, but knots itself up in its own frustration with governmental silence on the perps&rsquo; ethnicity.)</p>
<p>The second is a brief report about a Serbian spa town of 6,000 on the banks of the Drijna River, which, since May, I believe, has become host to 2,500 Muslim &ldquo;asylum&rdquo;-seekers from Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere. A brutal gang rape of a British woman last month by a group of Afghan men has now brought the townspeople to state of protest in which they are now refusing to send their children to school until matters are addressed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s instructional about these videos? By showing what happens when Islam burgeons inside Western societies, they teach that survival of these Western societies depends, for essential starters, on halting Islamic immigration. We have enough criminality and psychosis of our own without importing large, undigestible swaths of a violently misogynistic culture.</p>
<p>Duh?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not &#8216;whites&rsquo; but white business people or white lawyers or white judges that enable and enact these unwanted people.  The average white person (whatever country you are talking about) does not want them, does not want diversity, didn&rsquo;t want them as slaves, does not want their country being an empire ruling over others and a whole host of other issues.  It&rsquo;s a minority of whites that are pushing these anti-white policies. </p>

<p>Quit calling them &#8220;Whites&#8221;. Haven&rsquo;t we discussed this enough times on Amren? Start by naming those who had the power and the $$$$ to do this and all their anti-White organizations.</p>

<p>You are wrong.  </p>
<p>Only a white-hating genocidist, racist and bigot would make this claim. </p>
<p>You need to stop blaming whites.  It was not white lawyers who fought for aa, busing and integration.  Whites do not run the media.  Look closer, ask Cui Bono?  That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find the answers.</p>

		<p>Cui Bono #27: If we all can reach the same conclusions, why is it difficult for us to actually say it? </p>
<p>The Founders were well aware of the dangers that a certain group posed to this Republic, and in the &#8220;Maxims of George Washington&#8221;, as I recall, by Applegate, he was quite clear about his beliefs. </p>
<p>We can find, even here, that a country which addressed this problem in the last century has been demonized for it. </p>
