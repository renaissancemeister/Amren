			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Crugnale, Mediaite, November 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>MSNBC commentator Karen Finney waded into the muddied waters of sexual politics and miscegenation on Monday&rsquo;s Martin Bashir. &#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be fascinating to see how this story unfolds over the next several days and particularly interesting to see how our friends on the right handle the accusations from these women in conjunction with how they handled Anita Hill.&#8221; &#8220;What do you mean, Karen?&#8221; Bashir pressed. &#8220;Look, I think it will be interesting to see if these guys rally around Herman Cain with as much voracity as they have these last couple of weeks now that it&rsquo;s clear that a whole other layer of black sexuality has been infused into this,&#8221; Finney explained. &#8220;Also remember these women were ten years younger than we&rsquo;re seeing them now. So that whole power dynamic. This is an older man, this younger women. White women, Black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s very jarring for the GOP, for anybody, I think, to see a black man be sexually aggressive in an unwanted way toward a blonde, white  &mdash;  especially a blonde, white woman,&#8221; added Touré. {snip}</p>

		<p>Karen Finney must think that the Republican Party actually cares about white people.  She has much to learn.</p>
<p>All the lamestream conservative talking heads coming to Herman Munster&rsquo;s defense are really playing with fire.  Far more white women than blacks listen to conservative talk radio, and defending a black man&rsquo;s inappropriate (at the least) conduct toward white women employees directly in his chain of command will probably turn enough of them off.</p>
<p>Then again, all this talk is moot anyway.  Like I said in the last Herman Munster thread here, Romney is inevitable, and pretty much has been for most of this year.  Especially now that nobody else is credible, he will win the Republican nomination because he did the political equivalent of holding his index finger to his nose and walking a ten foot straight line, i.e. making as few people mad as possible the least often, having the most money and the most name recognition.  He will beat Obama because of the rotten economy, nothing more.  And so we&rsquo;ll have yet another neo-liberal Republican as President.  Do what Jack from Chicago advises, focus on your local elected offices and downballot stuff.</p>

<p>Clearly Toure doesn&rsquo;t get out to the real world much.  She is really struggling with stereotypes   &mdash;   GOP is bad and racist.  Yet they have a black front runner, who likes the ladies.  BTW Cain doesn&rsquo;t discriminate for what he likes.  But that is shocking to Toure.  Toure stumbles with blonde and connects that with white women not sure what to say.  Not too many honey blonde black women.  Give Cain credit, he knows superior product.</p>

		<p>This kind of dynamic is not hard to understand. The results are always, unfortunately, predictable. Recall Gene McKinney, the first Black Sergeant Major of the US Army. No you won&rsquo;t be seeing him cropping up any time soon in a primer of famous black firsts. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the first and to date the only African-American to reach that rank in the United States Army. McKinney was the only Sergeant Major of the Army to resign. In 1998, he was courtmartialed on a variety of charges including sexual harassment and obstruction of justice. He was convicted and demoted to the rank of Master Sergeant.&#8221;</p>
<p>He later appeared in the news for &#8220;hit[ing] a man with a car on purpose, and was charged with felony malicious wounding.This occurred after McKinney was driving erratically with two slug passengers.When the passengers exited the car, one of them attempted to take a photograph of McKinney&rsquo;s license plate, and claimed that McKinney drove his car into him.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Thank you Hirsch for the infor about Mckinney. I remember the case but I thought he was just some run of the mill sergeant.</p>
<p>The black feeling against the feminists was ferocious during that case. Like most affirmative action blacks, he was ghetto underneath.</p>
<p>Despite the way black men behave around anything female from their own daughters to elderly woman near enough to be groped on the subway, feminists still hate, despise and want to exterminate White men and worship and adore black men.</p>

		<p>I like to watch Fox sometimes for ony 2 reasons.  It is not a reality show and it has fewer commercials than most channels.</p>
<p>For weeks now it has been nothing but Cain, Cain, Cain.</p>
<p>So I stopped watching.  With all the shows I boycott because of anti White programming, I really should cancel cable.</p>

<p><br>
Are you kidding?!  I&rsquo;m a blonde, white woman, and I&rsquo;d say 90% of the men who&rsquo;ve been sexually aggressive towards me were black.  Most of the other 10% were mestizo/hispanics.  Outside of a sleazy dance club, white men are almost never sexually aggressive towards women (and even then, it&rsquo;s predominantly &#8220;minorities&#8221; doing the groping).  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sexually harassed on the street by black men as young as 12 and as old as late-70s.  They&rsquo;ve even bothered me in the grocery store and the library.  I&rsquo;m not particularly attractive or stylish, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter!  It&rsquo;s like they see a blonde and go immediately into hunting mode.  It&rsquo;s ubiquitous and revolting.  <br>

		<p>My liberal blond girlfriend hated Black men, because virtually everyoneof them put heavy pressue on her.  She was very polite in saying, &#8220;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m already dating.&#8221;  Yet, most of the aggressive Blacks responded with: &#8220;You&rsquo;re just racist.&#8221;  in an attempt to guilt-trip her into dating them.  She was under constant attack.  </p>

		<p>well that miscegenation thing is gross, especially to me: a young blonde. but, I wanted the GOP to support cain for one reason: to prove once and for all that race matters most. obama the less than 50% black failed, and people like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity claimed it was politics, and thay were half-right. when the 90% black Cain failes, it will prove for everyone what we on AMREN have been saying for years: Race matters. I really want Ron Paul to win. who will be his VP? Bachmann? Ron Paul for the WIN</p>

		<p>Karen Finney is fond of saying that the Democratic Party is going to be one of blacks, browns, and youth.  Like fellow black Donna Brazile did in the last presidential campaign, Finney is as much as telling non-youthful white Dems to take a hike.  These women, like their white liberal buddies, have their heads in the clouds and apparently don&rsquo;t know that middle-aged and older whites can swing national elections.  <br>
Much of the commentary that takes place now on TV is no more than entertainment.  The shows&rsquo; producers pick some controversial topic and tell the commentators to wing it.  Apparently, Finney and Toure (who gives no other name) have picked out the position that whites can be made to feel guilty by reminding them of their feelings about black males and white females.  That obviously works with fuzzyheaded liberals, but not with the American mainstream.  <br>
Whatever polls presently indicate, there&rsquo;s no way that Republicans will choose a black for nominee.  There are a few deluded people who believe the GOP can take black votes away from Obama with Cain, but these people simply don&rsquo;t know blacks.  Romney will be the choice because voters will want a strong-appearing, strait-laced white man to counter Obama.  In the meantime, commentators like Limbaugh have to find something else to talk about besides the inevitable.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you said except the part about him defeating Obama. He is seen as too RINO (republican in name only), he has flipped flopped all over the place and he is a Mormon. More importantly, the lamestream media has already stated the attacks on all Obama&rsquo;s opponents. </p>
<p>They will make sure Obama is re-elected.   </p>

		<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m naive, but are we to believe that a black man would use his position of authority to pressure a white woman to have sex with him for a job? I mean, aren&rsquo;t black men the paragon of virtue when it comes to marriage, fidelity, etc?</p>

		<p>Can Republicans - especially those down South - really expect to vote for Cain, especially in light of these allegations? If even ONE of these accusers is telling the truth, then he should resign from the race immediately.</p>
<p>I do question why NOW these allegations are brought to the front, especially since Cain is (somehow) polling near the front. When he was in single digits, why didn&rsquo;t the accusers come forth then? It also begs the question - of Ron Paul were in this situation, would there be allegations against him?</p>

<p>I am thinking that he won&rsquo;t, and for a number of reasons.  One is that Ron Paul has said he will run as an independent if he fails to get the Republican nomination.  Next, because it turns out that all those illegals that ICE supposedly has sent home is in question; looks like a big numbers scam.  Our immigrant population has actually swelled since 2008, and you know they are beholden to the Dems.  Finally, Romney is a man with no vision, he bends when the wind blows, but I believe that if elected, he will do a number of things that will guarantee chaos financially.  I think that many people sense this of him.  I listen to national and world market commentators and the last thing we need right now is anyone to seriously rock the boat with dumb, but typical partisan remedies.  So Obama will win as he represents a problem most are familiar with (too afraid to change horses mid-stream thing) and there are still plenty of whites who will vote for him.  I actually think that Gingrich probably represents the candidate with the most management and diplomatic ability, as well as the most experience and knowledge of all of them.  But when you consider that Cain has this sex scandal going AND he was shown to not know basic foreign policy info like China possessing nuclear weapons since the 60s, and he still can have a high rating among conservatives, shows the quality of the average conservative out there.</p>
<p>I know we are heading for a huge national and worldwide collapse, but I also am not anxious for it to happen.</p>

		<p>All the stupid neocon talk radio hosts and op-ed writers will rush to defend Cain and slander his white accusers just like they did with the equally guilty, lying-through-his-teeth Clarence Thomas.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;m glad Thomas is on the high court as he&rsquo;s been a good Justice. Still, the fact is Anita Hill told the truth while Thomas committed perjury and played the race card as shamelessly as Jackson and Sharpton ever did.  </p>

<p>White race realists and White Nationalists need to engage their brains and understand that the real diabolically evil purpose of a statement like the one above - is to basically, allow the enemies of White European people to once again stretch the boundaries of discourse and to establish new milestones as to what must now be not only &#8216;accepted&rsquo;, but also aggressively promoted, cheered and eventually &#8216;mandated&rsquo; by the GOP, in order to prove they are not &#8216;racists&rsquo;.   </p>
<p>I contend that this news witch is repeating a new mantra that she has been coached to utter by her Cultural Marxist paycheck signers.   She is laying down the gauntlet - and basically telling the GOP and anyone who votes for the GOP that they must CHEER and CELEBRATE and PROMOTE race mixing, which clearly spells the genocide of White European people - or else, they will be called &#8216;racists&rsquo;. </p>
<p>She is also trying to outflank and maneuver the already nauseating GOP talking heads on radio and TV by challenging them to continue to defend this crotch groping, degenerate, predatory black horn-dog - which would be the absolute ultimate illustration of vomit-inducing pandering to minority racial intimidation tactics, and which will succeed in creating even more disgust and anger in their 99.99% White conservative voting base.  </p>
<p>Why, if I were a cynical guy - I&rsquo;d almost begin to think that a big part of the liberal Democrat strategy is to maneuver the GOP into situations whereby they snooker the GOP into adopting positions on these kinds of super-charged racial issues that are guaranteed to turn off the GOP base and thereby lower the turnout on election day.  </p>
<p>And, being The Stupid Party - the GOP continually and repeatedly falls into this clever trap and appears to never wise up to how the left is setting them up.  </p>

		<p>Cain is playing the blame game, as usual&hellip;he blames Rick Perry for the leak, the democrats and even some of the GOP. Typical of his ilk. I notice the two that came forward are BLONDE White women. I bet the other two are also blondes.  Again, typical of the black male always thinking White women are the prize.</p>
<p>As poster #2 says, I will never vote for any black or any non-White for any office. If Whites don&rsquo;t stick to their own race for once, then things will only worsen for our race and for our own survival. I want a PRO-White party and nothing else will do.</p>

		<p>Before I am taken to task for what I&rsquo;ve said above, allow me to expand a little on the unholy union of an African male and a White female. It is a relationship based purely on lust and extreme differences.</p>
<p>There are no two races more genetically different than the Black and White races. We can immediately see this on a physical level. Her hair is straight his is kinky. Her skin is white his is black. Her facial features are sharp and aqualine his features are dull and thick. Clearly on a physical level they are extremely different.</p>
<p>There are other differences as well. Compare the type of civilizations her race has created with what his race has created. What has his race done for the betterment of mankind in comparison with hers? What technological advancements in science or medicine has his race made compared to hers? What great and notable people that have made significant achievements for mankind has his race produced? And hers?</p>
<p>The next Isaac Newton, Mozart, Rembrandt, or George Washington will never come from her. She&rsquo;s seen to that. Because the African can never produce a White child. She has broken all racial bonds with her own people and rejected the natural principle of kind-after-like-kind that we find everywhere in nature. She has rejected her natural instincts and desire to have a baby like herself. Instead, she has lusted after strange flesh.</p>
<p>He will never be close to her in any meaningful emotional way. He will never understand her on a deep level the way a man of her own kind would. They are too genetically different. Still, she abandons common sense, nature&rsquo;s principles, the racial ties to her own people, and defies what God has established. For God did not make the White womb for the African anymore than He made the Asian womb for the White man.</p>
<p>We used to know these things. Our forefathers did.</p>

<p>On balance, Thomas has been good on SCOTUS.  The additional complication is this:  Bush 41 appointed him.  If not Clarence Thomas, he would appointed some white neo-liberal.  Most non-Reagan Republican judicial appointments are like that.  Don&rsquo;t forget, Eisenhower foisted Earl Warren upon us, and many of the trial level Federal judges that ordered deseg rulings were Republican non-Reagan appointees.  Then again, Reagan isn&rsquo;t exempt from criticism here, either, because Bush 41&rsquo;s and Bush 43&rsquo;s Presidencies are both part of Reagan&rsquo;s legacy, neither happen if Reagan doesn&rsquo;t pick the elder Bush as a running mate in 1980.</p>

		<p>Yes, there have been more than one allegation of Cain&rsquo;s sexually aggressive behaviour toward blond, white women. Cain&rsquo;s support from the white community has only slightly decreased. No one cares anymore. </p>
<p>These allegations have been heavily publicized by the media because they are worried Cain will beat Obama.  If the MSM is successful in destroying Cain, we either have four more years of Obama, or four years of Romney. Romney is similar to GW Bush&hellip;a liberal posing as a republican. </p>

Any White candidate for office who could be linked to one of these groups would not gets elected.

<p>It is a fact that two women complained of sexual harassment by Cain while he was head of the National Restaurant Association. It is a fact that the claims were settled and that the two complaining witnesses were given five-figure sums in exchange for their release of claim and silence. </p>
<p>Second, the story is important NOW because the Cain is running for president and at least someone is conducting the kind of due diligence that should have been conducted four years ago on Barry Soetero.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So Obama will win as he represents a problem most are familiar with (too afraid to change horses mid-stream thing) and there are still plenty of whites who will vote for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>I too think obama will win again, partly because of his black, brown White traitor especially female base and partly because of ACORN and other vote fraud organizations from the old mafia boss system still in place in Chicago, Philly etc to all these federally funded get out the minority vote groups.</p>
<p>In a few years the hispanic immigrant states with many electoral votes like California, Texas, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey will have enough electoral votes to elect every president for 100 years.  5 to 10 states will elect the presidents.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t think the republicans will make any effort to beat Obama.  They did not last time.  They won&rsquo;t this time.  I just read a report that Wall street made 8 times more money during Obama&rsquo;s term that 8 years under President Bush.  So the big wall streeet money is behind Obama.  Ford, Woods/Rosenwald, Tides/Heinz, Carnegie SPLC ADL, all the billion dollar liberal foundations are behind Obama.</p>
<p>County clerks in all the big black, brown and White traitor liberal cities are mostly black and brown democrats.</p>
<p>The republicans have nothing. The Republican party is dying like the Whigs.  There does not seem to be anything to replace them. </p>
<p>Anyone who tried to form a WWA, White Workers of America party would be sent to federal prison for hate crime.</p>

<p>Romney will never be president of the United States and there is no chance he will beat Obama.</p>
<p>Romney is a flip-flopper and a liar.  The Democrats are licking their chops and have already pounced on him.  They&rsquo;ve eliminated Palin, Bachman and Cain, next will be Romney.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll attack him on abortion, which he said he believed should be made legal, on guns because he supported the Brady Law and the assault weapons ban.  Romney was called out by Perry for allowing illegal aliens to work on his property, squirmed a bit and then admitted that he HAD hired a lawn company that used illegal aliens, of course, &#8220;without his knowledge.&#8221; </p>
<p>When Santorum nailed him on Romneycare, which is the blueprint for Obamacare, Romney claiming weakly that &#8220;It was crafted for the people of Massachusetts&#8221;,  when in his books he stated &ldquo;We can accomplish this same thing for everyone in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think the Democrats and MSM won&rsquo;t bring this up, they already have. They&rsquo;re going to be shoving if in our faces 24/7 if Romney is the Republican candidate.  IOW, the Republicans do no have a viable candidate, which serves them right for ignoring their white base and marginalizing Ron Paul.</p>

<p>I trust you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a Cain booster - far from it. To me, the man is no better than Jackson, Sharpton, Coleman Young, or Colin Powell. He talks out of both sides of his mouth on issues like the Second Amendment, when he&rsquo;s not being mealy-mouthed like he is now.</p>
<p>The man is a typical Bantu, blaming everyone and everything, except himself; for his situation. I would hope that Republican voters take stock of themselves, and question do they really want this man, just so they can &#8220;out-Bantu&#8221; Democrats? If Cain draws his support from the Tea Party, then it shows me they&rsquo;ll go over the cliff with a flawed candidate, like they did with Sharron Angle in NV and Christie O&rsquo;Donnell in CT, in 2010. It seems to me, they don&rsquo;t really give a flying duck about the USA long-term, as long as they get an arch-conservative candidate as their standard-bearer. Do they not understand that such a candidate will never win California, or even be competitive in the battleground states? If Cain is the Republican nominee in 2012; we&rsquo;ve had it. </p>

		<p>I will admit I was initially willing to defend Cain when it initially only sounded like he made some comments that were taken as &#8220;harassment&#8221;. However, now that it has come out that the accuser is white, and that he essentially propositioned her (and despite he being married), I say now that he must be completely anathematized and declared unfit for ANY public office or place in politics. </p>
<p>In a multi-ethnic/multiracial society, a cross-racial violation MUST be punished with greater severity than intra-group violations. Tolerating and respecting the dignity of the other group are essential: before the Civil Rights Era this was the case, and America was able to function. Now, thanks to the liberal transformation of society, Blacks and others freely disrespect and degrade whites at every chance: and if the whites stand up for themselves, THEY become the object of condemnation. </p>
<p>This woman is courageous for going public. </p>

<p>There are plenty of decent Black Americans - and most Black American men, or really any American men (including me) are going to be interested when some sexy blond gal approaches us and wants to meet for drinks to discus&hellip; well anything, including her career.</p>
<p>Only in America can there be career destroying sex scandals where there wasn&rsquo;t any sex - there was just the suggestion, of interest in sex.</p>
<p>Oh, brother. </p>
<p>Think this would be a big scandal in France or Brazil?</p>
<p>The solution is to just accept the reality that Black Americans are now Yellow Dog Democrats - same as White Southerners were for ~ 100 years. </p>
<p>When you find decent, responsible Black African Americans - support them in the Democrat party, don&rsquo;t try to promote them as GOP Presidential candidates all in some ridiculous hope that the mainstream media MSM, Washington, New York, Hollywood, Harvard and Yale social elites will accept you as being &#8220;not racist&#8221;.</p>

<p>Christine O&rsquo;Donnell and Sharron Angle weren&rsquo;t &#8220;imperfect,&#8221; other than the fact that they&rsquo;re human.  It&rsquo;s just that Delaware is a deep blue state, thanks to its northern county, (Engelmann?) and no Republican will ever win Senate from Delaware, probably ever again.  As it was, O&rsquo;Donnell won the state&rsquo;s middle and southern county both in the primary and in the general, it&rsquo;s just that the county that has Wilmington is population heavy, and has lots of blacks and Hispanics.  As far as Nevada, it didn&rsquo;t matter who the Republicans nominated, the gaming industry owners and unions weren&rsquo;t going to let their Senate Majority Leader in the person of Harry Reid go down without a fight.  The leader of the Senate is a nice political friend to have.</p>
<p>Now I have some bad news from the personal department.  I&rsquo;ve commented from time to time on James Edwards&rsquo;s blog and maybe here that my powers of persuasion are below average.  To prove my point, when I talked to my own mother on the phone not more than a half hour ago, the very woman who sat me on her knees and taught me how to &#8220;dislike blacks,&#8221; to say it charitably, she out and outright told me she&rsquo;s voting Herman Cain.  I tried to argue, and she agreed with my reasoning about how a white country shouldn&rsquo;t have a black President, but it fell on deaf ears.  Too, I couldn&rsquo;t get anywhere with trying to convince her that there was something to these womens&rsquo; allegations.  My mother is the kind of person who wouldn&rsquo;t put up with any supervisor, black, white or otherwise, behaving in any wise inappropriately around her.  Yet, she still doesn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>My last ditch effort was trying to convince her that he wasn&rsquo;t really &#8220;conservative,&#8221; that his forsaken &#8220;brought to you by the number nine&#8221; tax plan had no chance of becoming law because the accountants and tax lawyers&rsquo; lobbies would spill blood all over Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street before letting it pass.

If that happens, conservative Euro-Americans will have no place to turn (barring an independent run by Ron Paul) and millions would opt to just &#8220;stay home&#8221; and of course, the re-election of Obaamaa would be assured.</p>

		<p>Please bear in mind that the whole controversy is ABOUT REPUBLICANS AT THIS STAGE of the election cycle.  It has nothing to do with Democrats.  </p>
<p>I really cannot see any way in which someone with Cain&rsquo;s past - white or black - wins the presidency.  Maybe in some countries in Europe, but not here.  So if you are a Republican, do you *really* want to bet the whole kit and kaboodle on this guy?  If not, the Republicans need to kill him off now before he sucks any more money, time and energy out of GOP pockets.  </p>
<p>But The GOP are in a bind:  Just how to get him to step aside without seeming racist??</p>

		<p>Hard to believe that Cain seems to be escaping 4 accusers plus the I-would-have-thought-deadly &#8220;You want a job don&rsquo;t you?&#8221; quote.</p>
<p>A white candidate with similar allegations would have been ridden out on a rail.</p>
