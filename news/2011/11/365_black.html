			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>McDonald&rsquo;s, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At McDonald&rsquo;s®, we believe that African-American culture and achievement should be celebrated 365 days a year  &mdash;  not just during Black History Month. That&rsquo;s the idea behind 365Black.com. It&rsquo;s a place where you can learn more about education, employment, career advancement and entrepreneurship opportunities, and meet real people whose lives have been touched by McDonald&rsquo;s. Plus, you can also have a chance to win exciting once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. So make sure you visit often  &mdash;  you just might get inspired.</p>
<p>Like the unique African Baobab tree, which nourishes its community with its leaves and fruit, McDonald&rsquo;s has branched out to the African-American community nourishing it with valuable programs and opportunities.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s something tragic if a trashy run-down fastfood chain is the apex of your cultural heritage, and modern-day meeting point for likeminded individuals.</p>
<p>True, Europeans in general vary wildly of how culturally aware they are. French, Italians, Dutch and to some extent Germans still have very strong attachments to their history, so too does the British.</p>
<p>But those of us who are aware have richer venues to immerse ourselves in than a corporate hatchjob from McDonalds. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something telling about this article. I have known blacks who have complained to me that they don&rsquo;t have an identity, and they point out that most blacks in America today have no real relation with slavery in their family(even if most of them still want to use it as an excuse). The haitian community, for instance, is just one of many which is fractured.</p>
<p>I read an article at The Forward, the Jewish daily (leftist) newspaper, about blacks converting to Judaism. It was a tragic read. They called themselves &#8216;The New Israelites&rsquo;. The reporter took pains to paint them as &#8216;Another kind of Jews&rsquo;, but most commenters saw through the farce and called it what it is: African attempts to hijack someone else&rsquo;s identity, and a sad statement of the cultural decay and confusion of Black America.</p>

		<p>I often have to wonder at the off-the-wall ad campaigns in which successful companies engage.  Apparently, these ad execs can&rsquo;t think of anything else to lure white people, or just people in general, since McD&rsquo;s is making money hand over fist.  So, in order to do SOMETHING, ANYTHING to make their jobs appear necessary, they target 12% of the American population.  Does it matter that increased business by blacks will drive away every other ethnicity?  Or that franchises may be forced to hire increased security or that customers may sue them when violence breaks out?  It&rsquo;s about as smart as Coke changing its formula.</p>

<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t already boycotted them years ago for being globalist pigs, their adventures in selective cultural appreciation would would be enough.  Is there anyone that honestly thinks McDonald&rsquo;s corporate HQ wouldn&rsquo;t host anti-racist &#8220;training&#8221; for its employees? Does anyone honestly think they haven&rsquo;t already or that they don&rsquo;t do it on regular basis? Yer darn tootin&rsquo; they do. </p>

<p><i>At McDonald&rsquo;s®, we believe that African-American culture and achievement should be celebrated 365 days a year &mdash; not just during Black History Month.</i></p>
<p><br>
Ronald, you delightful clown, you know as well as I do that there&rsquo;s barely enough African-American culture and achievement to fill a Black History WEEK   &mdash;   so your idea of extending it to a YEAR can only be another of your red-nosed, fright-wigged jests!</p>
<p>Race aside, looking at Mickey D&rsquo;s &#8220;365Black&#8221; venture strictly from a business POV, it makes absolutely no sense. Af/Ams are 13% of the US pop&rsquo;n. Why would ANY company court 13% of the pop&rsquo;n at the risk of alienating the other 87%? The only possible way a company MIGHT be able to justify such a marketing strategy to their shareholders is, if that 13% happened to be a spectacularly desirable demographic, i.e. ultra-rich repeat customers with loads of discretionary income. </p>
<p>Which, needless to say, does NOT describe the black market segment, of any age, in any part of the country. </p>
<p>I would very much like to see McDonald&rsquo;s stock prices etc after their 365 days of racial atonement are over. I can&rsquo;t imagine how their profits could possibly be up; I am certain they will be down. Corporate do-gooderism has a heavy price   &mdash;   esp. when the do-gooderism gets <i>racial.</i> </p>

		<p>White families should consider avoiding McDonalds entirely as the public record clearly shows a violent beat-down from either side of the counter is always a possibility. Likewise Home Depot&rsquo;s Hispanic centered business culture and courting of illegals should drive those concerned with borders, language and culture to take their business to competitors. Bank of America needs no introduction as their present and past practices make them a threat to White Civilization itself.</p>

Companies are forced to make these statements to appease blacks and prove they have a track record of supporting blacks (in case someone files a discrimination lawsuit).</p>

		<p>McDonalds doesn&rsquo;t care one way or another. They are moving on to ply their trade to Asia, and poisoning Europeans. There are several billion suckers there that think the stuff they sell is pretty novel, and hip for the time being. </p>
<p>Of course, they did effectively get kicked out of Latin America, most of Africa, and spun off their horrible Chipotle restaurants. However, even if they lost every single American sale it wouldn&rsquo;t put them out of business. America is no longer their largest source of revenue, its already surpassed by Europe, and will probably be surpassed by Asia in the next 5 years. Those horrible smoothies, and McCafe products are the only thing propping up American sales other than the black community.</p>
<p>I say let the black community have it. Let them become dominant in the black community, alienate their white customers publicly, and then become like the black mall after they have poisoned their new customers long enough, and the winds change. </p>

		<p>I think we should embrace this. McDonalds&rsquo; food is going to slowly kill whoever eats it regularly. If this takes off there will be more blacks who are just too fat and unhealthy to carry out the sort of violence they otherwise might.</p>
<p>Of course the white community, in the USA especially should have better nutrition than what we do. Things may get pretty hectic soon, and our people need to be fit for it. (Many) Blacks do seem to have an advantage in their natural trend towards athleticism, and though we may be smarter, we need to take physical matters into account. If the battle for civilization comes down to the intelligent wimps Vs. the near-retarded, the latter will win. We cannot let that happen.</p>
<p>Besides that, Mcdonalds should not be rewarded for this. If you must eat at a fast food place, go somewhere else.</p>

<p>I know the term AA is excepted, but something about the stupid tree and the we are black at Mcdonalds theme is enough to keep me from ever spending another dime there.   That and all the ads where the black people have to dance and rap before placing their orders ;). </p>

		<p>I expect nothing more from McDonald&rsquo;s than to sell me cheap, fatty food ASAP because I&rsquo;m hungover or at the airport or both! It&rsquo;s trendy to criticize McD&rsquo;s over other fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>I applaud McD&rsquo;s if they&rsquo;re trying to get blacks to work. Ronald McDonald can kiss every black baby coming through the door for all I care.  But hiring blacks has the negative effect of qualifying them for &#8220;welfare-to-work&#8221; programs like the one here in CA.</p>
<p>Also love how McDonald&rsquo;s still feels obliged to bedazzle their name with a &#8220;®.&#8221;  Is there an English reader in the world who doesn&rsquo;t know that McD&rsquo;s is trademarked?</p>

		<p>Very few things in this sad, pathetic world surprise me anymore, but I am continually stunned on so many levels by the long line of whites in cars wrapped around the drive through of virtually every McD&rsquo;s you pass by.</p>
<p>First, the obvious, blatent drive for specifically blacks. Not just minorities, the &#8216;disadvantaged&rsquo;, etc., but stated outright: BLACKS. That should shake the shoulder of even the most obtuse white who is clearly aware of the illegality of whites to promote anything in their own interest. Yet it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The well-known nutritional values of their food that indicate a &#8216;death wish diet&rsquo;. They apparently don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The public knowledge of the lethal violence likely to break out at the drop of a hat. They apparently don&rsquo;t care about that, either.</p>

<p>Sometime back in the &rsquo;70s or &rsquo;80s, I remember reading a magazine article about McDonald&rsquo;s corporate strategy. Back when they were starting out in the &rsquo;50s, their head honcho Ray Kroc committed to making his restaurants as family-friendly as possible. Because other burger joints and malt shops back then were known as hangouts for greasers, hot-rodders, and Juvenile Delinquents (remember them?), McD&rsquo;s decided their shops would never contain any cigarette machines or payphones (which still the case to this day). The idea was let their competitors have the troublesome teenaged clientele; the Golden Arches would instead position itself as the &#8220;good&#8221; burger chain. The one you can take the kids to without having some duck-tailed Fonzie-wannabe leaning on the cig machine while making an obscene phone call and leering at your pubescent daughter. </p>
<p>And for several decades, the concept of cheap, G-rated food and ambiance worked brilliantly. McDonald&rsquo;s became not only a large, rich corporation, they turned into an international money-making machine the likes of which the food industry had never before seen. </p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t say what caused the McD&rsquo;s brain trust to abandon this successful strategy of wholesomeness and trade it for the current &#8220;365Black&#8221; (<i>sic</i>) masterplan. I&rsquo;d probably guess &#8220;Political Correctness gone mad,&#8221; if I didn&rsquo;t think Political Correctness was mad to begin with. But for a company that originally set out courting the most respectable and well-behaved segment of society   &mdash;   suburban middle-class white parents and their non-smoking children   &mdash;   to change course to go chasing after <i>the poorest and most troublesome segment of society,</i> well, that&rsquo;s something for historians and economists of the future to try to figure out. As an example of a corporation doing a total 180-degree turnaround in their Mission Statement, the self-inflicted blackening of McDonaldland is pretty hard to beat for sheer bizarreness. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a diversity education curriculum since the late 70s and continue that today because we want to have continuous learning and education around why diversity and inclusion is important to our business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>https://www.diversity-executive.com/article.php?article=480</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s diversity management model consists of four core building blocks:</p>
<p>- Affirmative Action: A voluntary program that assures careful monitoring of our recruitment, hiring, training and promotions. <br>
- Recognizing Differences: The acknowledgement and support of unique differences among colleagues in the U.S. and across the world.<br>
- Valuing Differences: Establishing the value of differences among colleagues within the McDonald&rsquo;s system as a major contribution to competitive advantage in the business process.<br>
- Managing Diversity: Actively using knowledge and management skills to encourage the best performance from everyone in the system. </p>
<p>  Committed to Diversity </p>
<p>•Franchisees – Thirty-nine percent of McDonald&rsquo;s owner/operators in the United States are minorities and women. These independent businessmen and women own and operate nearly 4,000 restaurants. More than half of the individuals in training to become new U.S. McDonald&rsquo;s franchisees are minorities and women.</p>
<p>•Suppliers –McDonald&rsquo;s purchases nearly $3.3 billion a year in food and paper products from U.S. minority and women suppliers. The U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s 1998 &ldquo;BusinessLINC&rdquo; report – a blueprint for companies interested in fostering small business development - highlighted McDonald&rsquo;s for best practices in minority outreach and minority supplier development. </p>
<p>•Employees – More than 52 percent of employees in our U.S. business are minorities, and more than 57 percent are women. Thirty-five percent of our corporate officers are minorities or women, as are more than 70 percent of our managers. </p>
<p>•Franchisee Organizations – Franchisee organizations of African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, and women owner/operators provide members with a collective voice for discussing issues with senior management and advise the company on service to its diverse customers.</p>
<p>•Employee Networks – Home office networks provide McDonald&rsquo;s diverse employees with career assistance, advocacy, and support. They also advise the company on recruitment, other personnel practices, and maintaining a strong connection with our diverse customer base.</p>
<p>•Diversity Education – Through seminars and workshops, McDonald&rsquo;s incorporates commitment to diversity into the life of the organization. McDonald&rsquo;s has been providing diversity education for executives and restaurant managers for nearly 25 years.</p>
<p>•External Partnerships – McDonald&rsquo;s is committed to building partnerships and giving back to the communities in which we do business. Our national partners include the NAACP, the National Urban League, the National Council of La Raza, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Hispanic Medical Association, the Organization of Chinese Americans, Catalyst, the Women&rsquo;s Foodservice Forum, and the U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s Office of Disability Employment Policy. </p>

		<p>If McD&rsquo;s can stretch that flat little chewy rubber thing into a disc and call it a burger then I guess they can figure out a way to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; African-American culture 365 days a year.</p>
<p>If you read the site it&rsquo;s almost a parody - like it was dreamed up by comedy writers from AmRen.</p>
<p>I also can&rsquo;t quite figure out why the company is so insistent on pandering to blacks - in reality, a clientele almost no business would want. Perhaps it&rsquo;s protection against government/nanny state laws that focus on eating habits or on the probably gazillion &#8220;&#8216;scriminashun&#8221; lawsuits from fired low-wage workers looking for a lottery prize. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think McD could really care one iota about blacks - who have caused the chain nothing but trouble. </p>
<p>Bottom line, anyway - never go to McD. I don&rsquo;t. Do not patronize the panderers. </p>
<p>Besides, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Ronald goes Afro.</p>
<p>On a side note, it would seem that KFC would have a tougher time playing to blacks because of the PC nonsense surrounding fried chicken. </p>

He dressed normal, But he wife was a hood rat, sooo fat and her clothing looked crazy. They had alot of bratty kids. also the home had five BR&rsquo;s they only had furniture in the basement and the LR. the MasterBR I never saw. I am making the point, hood rich. I could never afford a 550K HOME. I checked the tax records &amp; He was the owner. But let me make myself clear, They did NOT belong in that community, and I am from the Midwest. Even worst than that story I just told you. Is when they come up from Atlanta. They think they run everything. The women are the worst. Oh also as if you could not have guessed.

<p>We turn the dials when we see something we like or dislike.  Whenever I see a black face, I turn the dial way over to minus minus.  Hispanic and asian to minus.  White to plus plus.</p>

		<p>Last time I was in a McDonald&rsquo;s, about a year ago, the first thing I noticed was a huge promotion and applications in plain sight on the counter for Hispanic- ONLY scholarships sponsored by (what else) McDonald&rsquo;s.  That was it!!  The government steals enough of my money for non-White-only causes!  I refuse to add to it.</p>
<p>There is no &#8220;365 Black&#8221; here, &#8220;this&#8221; being So Cal, where the black population has been displaced by Hispanics. McDonald&rsquo;s is not dumb.</p>
<p>I read this recently about McD&rsquo;s in Europe   &mdash;   I think they&rsquo;re test marking it there for possible use in the US.</p>
<p>From Fox Biz: </p>
<p><i>McDonald&rsquo;s is jumping on the technology bandwagon with a new system that will soon change the way European customers order food   &mdash;   picture computers instead of humans asking whether customers prefer fries and supersizes. The fast-food restaurant, known for its golden arches, Big Mac burgers and Happy Meals, will replace cashiers with touch-screen terminals and swipe cards at its 7,000 chain restaurants in Europe, according to the Financial Times.  This means the end of cash payments</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in the US EBT cards WILL be accepted as a &#8220;swipe card.&#8221;</p>
<p>Computers are just doing the jobs that illegal aliens can&rsquo;t do: Speak English!</p>

<p>Funny!! Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s NOT FOOD.  My chicken-loving dogs refuse to eat what McDonald&rsquo;s advertises as &#8220;grilled chicken.&#8221;  </p>
<p>sshadow:  Your post reminded me of something Steve Martin once related about McDonald&rsquo;s:</p>
<p><i>I have a theory about McDonald&rsquo;s, that is, everything they make is all one thing, and in the back they have this big vat full of this stuff, these little molds combining, like SPLURT &lsquo;Hamburger!&rsquo; SPLURT &lsquo;Shake!&rsquo; SPLURT &lsquo;Paper box!&rsquo; SPLURT &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your change!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>And, for anyone who continues to eat what McDonald&rsquo;s claims to be fit for human consumption: May God have Mercy on Your Heart!!</p>
