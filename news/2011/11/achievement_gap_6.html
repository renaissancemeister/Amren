<h1>Achievement Gap Exists for Kids Even Before Kindergarten</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Weber, MPR News, November 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>State education officials have released new data showing an achievement gap exists for students in Minnesota, even before they begin elementary school.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Readiness Study finds children of color and children who live in poverty are less likely to be considered ready for kindergarten than white students and those living above the poverty line.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State Education Department spokeswoman Charlene Briner says it&rsquo;s not surprising that the achievement gap between children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, and between those from different economic situations, is showing up in children at such young ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;These gaps that we see in our early learners are consistent all the way through,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not a surprise to us. It&rsquo;s another piece of evidence that really affirms that there are some significant gaps that we need to overcome in order to make sure every child learns.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the results, 63 percent of white students were considered ready for kindergarten, compared to 44 percent of Hispanic students, 44 percent of American Indian students, and 57 percent of black students.</p>

		<p>The primary requirements for kids to enter kindergarten are the ability to follow simple (really simple) instructions and to possess the requisite acceptable behavior for their age group.<br>
Neither of which black kids possess even at age 18.  </p>

<p>Here we go again.  &#8220;We&#8221; means the taxpayer.  &#8220;Need to overcome&#8221; means more programs and studies paid for by us.  &#8220;It is not a surprise&#8221; means they knew the outcome beforehand and performed this study just so they could say more needs aren&rsquo;t being met for minority students, known here as &#8220;every child&#8221;.</p>
<p>This makes me ill.  Soon, compulsory government pre-school will be required and I have three problems with this.  1. the government will take more control of our children at earlier and earlier ages and will thus be able to indoctrinate them before they even finish sucking their thumbs and 2. more federal/state money will go to this when we are already flat broke and 3. look at what compulsory kindergarten did  &mdash;  produced the dumbest and most brainwashed generation yet.  MORE government schooling will make it worse.</p>
<p>Of course, they could just go into people&rsquo;s homes and tell parents how to make them ready for kindergarten.  That is also something our government has no damn business doing.</p>

		<p>The 63% of White children ready for Kindergarten is worryingly low too. Then again a lot of White people I know over here in the UK use the TV as a babysitter. If the same goes over the pond then that explains a lot.</p>

		<p>Cynthia T. Garcia Coll was the lead in <em>Developmental Outcome of Minority Infants: A Process-oriented Look into Our Beginnings</em> (Child Development, Volume 61, pages 270â€“289, April 1990).  From the abstract:</p>
<p>&#8220;This article reviews the literature on the development of children of minority status from birth to 3 years of age (infants). 5 major sources of influence on the developmental outcome of minority infants are proposed: cultural beliefs and caregiving practices, health status and health care practices, family structure and characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and biological factors. It is suggested that differences exist between minority and Anglo families in their developmental goals and interactions during the infancy period. The health status of some minority groups places these infants in an at-risk category for neurodevelopmental problems. The family context is characterized by younger mothers, a higher percentage of single heads of households, but also large, extended families. Socioeconomic factors have a pervasive influence on both infants and parents, and the contribution of biological factors is suggested but poorly understood. It is concluded that these factors act synergistically to place these infants in <strong>alternative (not necessarily deviant) developmental pathways, or in &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; categories for neurodevelopmental problems</strong>, while canalization processes are operating to insure that major developmental milestones are achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, if minority infants are measurably different across race lines then stop using one set of measurements.  Use two sets of measurement, one for Anglo families and for minority families.  Because &#8216;separate but equal&rsquo; is okay sometimes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m calling nonsenseon this statement.  You have a right to your opinion but that is the extent of it.  My opinion is race and culture has everything to do with intelligence.  If black parents are too stupid to work with 1-2-3 yr old children, then that is a lack of intelligence.  However, many white parents don&rsquo;t seem to understand the necessity of working one-on-one with their children on numbers, letters, identification of things, movements, songs and rhymes etc&hellip;&hellip;.  not doing that with your babies will cause a severe lack compared to parents that lovingly do it.</p>

		<p>Whites have children after getting secure in their lives.  Blacks and Latinos have children and use them to demand money and failing that demand more equality and government programs.</p>

		<p>A very noteworthy, if much evaded, part of the pre-kindergarten<br>
achievement gap is within race and between males and females.<br>
Females, on average, have a much higher rate of biological <br>
maturation at age 5, say, than do males.  The females, accordingly, appear to have less challenge in learning basic<br>
reading. Gender segregation at this point in schooling might make too much sense to be seriously confronted. </p>

<p><br>
Poverty, poverty, poverty. Those poor poor people. The solution is more taxes from the white boobs to be filtered through liberal hands.</p>
<p>Children of color mature faster sexually than white children. Some get pregnant when they are 10 years old. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m gonna guess that those lower income White&rsquo;s children who fail to be ready for kindergarden do so, not because of income, but because of IQ.  They are the offspring of Whites who are living in the poverty level because they too likely have lower IQs than the average White.  These liberal pundents always like to blame poverty for low achievement in school when it&rsquo;s poor genetic material that keeps certain families of any color at a lower standard of living, generation after generation.</p>

		<p>I taught kindergarten in Chinatown; kids lived in unbelievable poverty; often 20 people to a single one bedroom apartment. In addition, about 80 percent of my students came to me knowing very little, if any English.</p>
<p>Yet, 90 percent of my students were reading at a second grade level or higher (In ENGLISH!) by the end of the year. NO discipline problems, EVER. These little Chinese 5 year olds sat still and eagerly copied their letters and numbers from the main whiteboard onto their little whiteboards. They sat quietly for half hour stories even at the beginning of the year when some of them didn&rsquo;t understand a single word I was saying.</p>
<p>All these &#8216;poor&rsquo; Chinese kids grow up to be engineers, doctors, and scientists despite their disadvantaged background.</p>
<p>Liberals can&rsquo;t explain this phenomenon. </p>
