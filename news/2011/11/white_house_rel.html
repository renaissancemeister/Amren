			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jorge Rivas, Color Lines, November 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration recently unveiled a 44-page report called &#8220;The President&rsquo;s Agenda and the African American Community&#8221; that highlights policies that the White House says have benefited black people. It is, in some respects, an answer to critics who&rsquo;ve argued that the president hasn&rsquo;t done enough to address the harsh economic realities in black communities.</p>
<p>The Root&rsquo;s Cynthia Gordy points out that last week&rsquo;s report highlights many of the same policies in &#8220;Creating Pathways to Opportunity,&#8221; the report released last month that outlined how the administration has helped low-income Americans. According to the new report, the Recovery Act and its later expansions kept 1.3 million African Americans above the poverty line in 2010 alone, while this year the administration&rsquo;s Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit has benefited 2.2 million black families and nearly half of all black children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other efforts the report identifies as having a disproportionately positive impact on African Americans include subsidized jobs programs, increased funding for Pell Grants, mortgage-modification plans for distressed homeowners and health care reform, according to Gordy&rsquo;s story at The Root.</p>

		<p>Are they going to airdrop this literature into &#8220;the hood&#8221; as a reminder to their most loyal constituency that they should turn out in force for 2012. 44 pages is a lot of reading with a 75 IQ.</p>

		<p>don&rsquo;t forget to add the following:</p>
<p>- using HUD to aggressively go after any community that wants to avoid Section 8 infestation! </p>
<p>- using the Justice Department as a special tool to aggressively kick the down the doors of any city, town or county that does not comply with HUD mandates.</p>
<p>- using the Justice Department to go after white people accused of discrimination while ignoring the many, many incidences of racial abuse and discrimination committed by blacks. </p>

		<p>If Obama wants to do something really worth while for the Black community, how about coming up with even one thing that will enable Blacks to stand on their own two feet and stop taking special help.  That would be something Obama and his brothers and sisters could rightfully be proud about.</p>

<p><br/>
And where, I wonder, is the 44-page report called &ldquo;The President&rsquo;s Agenda and the European American Community&rdquo; that highlights policies that the White House says have benefited white people?</p>
<p>Obamaumau was, after all, supposed to be the &#8220;postracial&#8221; president who would   &mdash;   FINALLY!   &mdash;   bring all the different ethnicities of America together into one beautiful inclusive Dawning of the Age of Aquarius.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Oh, silly me, I forgot   &mdash;   white people are out of fashion. So whatever WE want doesn&rsquo;t count anymore, and can be safely ignored.</p>

    When will the report be coming out that pertains to how this administration has helped white people ?  There won&rsquo;t be any ?<br/>
Jeeze,  that seems a bit &#8220;racist&#8221;</p>
<p>    I propose that when and if our country ever comes to its senses and has a white president again,  one of his priorities should be to list specifically how he has helped whites and white communities.</p>
<p>    No opposition to the report will be tolerated.</p>

		<p>I was just looking at the report.  On page 8 it lists my home town of Detroit as the place with the most African American businesses.  MOST of those businesses are wig and nail stores which open and stay in business about 8 months, then close.  They probably got government grants to open.  </p>
<p>Then, there is the &#8220;hand car washes&#8221;.  Yep.  When whites are driven out of an area, the car washes also close.  Blacks cannot run a mechanized car wash, so they &#8220;occupy&#8221; an abandoned car wash, rip out all the machinery and sell it as scrap metal and open it as a &#8220;hand car wash&#8221;  They generally have about 5 crack heads, a couple of buckets of water, dish soap,  a hose and rags (not sponges) to wash the cars.  </p>
<p>A few enterprising blacks do have successful landscaping businesses.  Blacks also have demolition companies and take down abandoned buildings.  They of course get the contracts from the black run city.   </p>
<p>I have NEVER seen a convenience store in the city owned by blacks.  Arabs own ALL of them. </p>
<p>Detroit is a sorry example of black enterprise. It is amusing that it is number one on the list. </p>

		<p>Oh, but I&rsquo;m sure a black conservative will be the answer, right, my neocons friends?  Come on, GOP, you need more blacks in your party who hate whites and conservatives and insult and call you a racist and who will be loyal to their own race when they have the chance and don&rsquo;t need you anymore.  Think of Michael Steele (who said the GOP looked like a Nazi Party) or Colin Powell and other black conservatives voting for Obama for instance.  Racial pandering and kissing up to blacks, hispanics and race hustlers has really worked out so far for the Republican Party, hasn&rsquo;t it? (sarcasm)</p>

		<p>I guess it is important for blacks (and many liberal and conservative whites for various reasons) in America to know they will continue to get preferential treatment through so many organizations at the behest of government (affirmative action)&hellip;otherwise the blacks of America will cause trouble (protest, riot, more crime, and so forth)for everyone including themselves&hellip;This eternal phenomenon used to be called:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Negro Question.&#8221;</p>
<p>That question has been asked and addressed over and over&hellip;</p>
<p>Now *the question* appears this way:</p>
<p>&#8220;The President&rsquo;s Agenda and the African American Community&rdquo; </p>
<p>This is really a political spin&hellip;*except* for the reparations program of affirmative action.</p>
<p>The answers are always the same&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing less than we deserve! </p>

		<p>OMG! The VERY FIRST LINE of this report contains a grammatical error! </p>
<p>&#8220;Since day one, the President has sought to restore the strength of middle class, increase shared prosperity, and bring back the American Dream, while also providing ladders for Americans willing to do their part.</p>
<p>Absolutely unbelievable. </p>

		<p>#6 Tom, when did any President ever claim to help European Americans?  They would be horrified at the very suggestion that they should <i>try</i> to help European Americans.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know why Obama bothered to issue the report.  He knows he&rsquo;s going to get 95% of the black vote no matter what.  Only if Al Sharpton jumped into the Democratic race and somehow wrested the nomination from Obama would there be any possibility of Obama losing the black vote.</p>
<p>What Obama is losing is the white vote.  But not to worry, by not enforcing immigration law and letting illegal aliens vote he will make up for those lost white votes.<br/>
