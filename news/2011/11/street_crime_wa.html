<h1>Street Crime Wave Hits Europe&rsquo;s Capital</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Johanna Somers, Yahoo! News, November 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A wave of theft and vandalism has hit the downtown of Europe&rsquo;s capital, only blocks away from where leaders have been trying to fix the continent&rsquo;s debt crisis, provoking the local police chief to blame immigrants and drug addicts.</p>
<p>While government heads pulled up in the past few days in luxury cars shielded by security vehicles, the streets nearby revealed a cruder side to Europe&rsquo;s economic troubles  &mdash;  shattered car window glass lining one major avenue and a slew of store windows smashed in a nearby neighborhood.</p>
<p>The daily average tallied 26 thefts from vehicles, 13 pickpocket incidents and nine violent thefts in October in the zone of Brussels-Capital and Ixelles, according to police. The zone covers large parts of the Brussels metropolitan area including the city center.</p>
<p>Pickpocket incidents in the year up to November 1 were up to 3,020 this year from 2,509 in the same period of 2010. Violent robberies rose to 1,955 from 1,725. Thefts from vehicles declined to 6,200 in the period this year from 6,500 last  &mdash;  but in October they went up by 16 percent.</p>
<p>Police chief Guido Van Wymerschn says that rime is rising due to drug addicts and illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It should put in place a policy so that migrants know what they are up against,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People deserve a chance but we can also be more selective in deciding who we accept and who we don&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some people blame rising crime on unemployment  &mdash;  though Belgian unemployment, at 6.7 percent in September 2011, was below the EU average of 9.7 percent and down from 8.2 percent in September 2010.</p>

Don&rsquo;t forget the LEGAL ones too, Chief. The legal ones that the EUrocrats keep inflicting upon not only The Capital of Europe, but on ALL of Europe. I&rsquo;d wager that the vast majority of Brussels&rsquo; pickpockets, muggers, rapists, etc, enjoy the legal &#8220;right&#8221; to be in your city   &mdash;   thanks to the hideous socialistic Superstate headquartered in your city. </p>

		<p>Brussels is plagued by African gangs.  With the exception of the language they speak, they are indistinguishable in appearance from American blacks.</p>

		<p>If you fell out of the sky into Brussels (just bear with me here&hellip;) you could be forgiven if it took you a while to guess what country you were in. Belgium would be far down the list and only the buildings, cars and general development would clue you in to the European part. Moreso than London, Paris, NY or LA, Brussels is a &#8220;world city&#8221; in the very worst meaning of the term. It boggles my mind why any American tourist would bother to include it on an itinerary unless they&rsquo;re looking for deals on knockoff designer bags sold by hordes of West Africans. That said, rural Belgium is lovely&hellip;.</p>

<p>In my experience the African Bantu is darker in color, does not ware the garish clothes or walk in the exaggerated manner as does the American Bantu. You can distinguish between the two groups.</p>
<p>And Europe as a whole, generally now, has a higher crime rate, sometimes much more so, than America. This has only occurred in the last few decades. That Europe of our ancestors that was left generations ago now is a thing of the past and always will be now.</p>

<p>Keep your head, such defeatism is not warranted. All formerly European-inhabited zones can and will be recovered if the folk are prepared to get their hands dirty. During the previous century millions were evacuated or deported against their will. It can and must be done if we are to survive as a people. This is a race war with no second-place &#8220;winners.&#8221; Those who throw in the towel are part of the problem, not the solution. </p>

<p>The term &#8220;illegal immigrant&#8221; generally refers to something different than in the US. It means that the migrant has not gone through the regular immigration process. Most foreigner migrants (non-Eu origin) in Europe, except perhaps Germany, are &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; who simply arrive and declare that they want asylum. The process for sorting that all out takes years, and in the end liberal judges will often block any attempt to deport them (no matter how many people they rape or murder). </p>
<p>The illegals live openly, knowing they have little chance of being arrested and ultimately deported. In the US illegals can be speedily deported, though in practice this only happens on the border. In the EU they are basically safe as soon as they touch the soil. Indeed, it might be said that they have even more &#8220;rights&#8221; than legal immigrants (they absolutely have more than EU-migrants from E.Europe). </p>
<p>The legal process is for wealthier foreigners, especially those with garbage credentials who will take jobs. </p>
<p>In the UK and France though, the problem is greater than just the recent migrants: second-generation children of Afro-Carib origin are probably the most vicious of all. </p>

		<p>The tripling of the crime rate from 1960 to 1980 was almost certainly caused largely by the civil rights legislation passed during the 1960s. Efforts to protect the so called &#8220;rights&#8221; of detainees meant that more criminals, especially black criminals, went free. <br>
 <br>
Believe it or not, the prison population declined from 1960 to 1970, although the national population increased. <br>
 <br>
Since 1980 the prison population has tripled. The crime rate has declined. Whites in the United States have learned, even though most are still afraid to say it in public, that blacks are different, and require a harsh criminal justice system to keep them under control. Of course, Southern whites knew this all along.<br>
 <br>
Europeans are still learning. Fortunately, they are learning. <br>
