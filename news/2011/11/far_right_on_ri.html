<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/06/far-right-rise-europe-report">Far Right on Rise in Europe, Says Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Walker and Matthew Taylor, Guardian (London), November 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The far right is on the rise across Europe as a new generation of young, web-based supporters embrace hardline nationalist and anti-immigrant groups, a study has revealed ahead of a meeting of politicians and academics in Brussels to examine the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Research by the British thinktank Demos for the first time examines attitudes among supporters of the far right online. Using advertisements on Facebook group pages, they persuaded more than 10,000 followers of 14 parties and street organisations in 11 countries to fill in detailed questionnaires.</p>
<p>The study reveals a continent-wide spread of hardline nationalist sentiment among the young, mainly men. Deeply cynical about their own governments and the EU, their generalised fear about the future is focused on cultural identity, with immigration  &mdash;  particularly a perceived spread of Islamic influence  &mdash;  a concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re at a crossroads in European history,&#8221; said Emine Bozkurt, a Dutch MEP who heads the anti-racism lobby at the European parliament. &#8220;In five years&rsquo; time we will either see an increase in the forces of hatred and division in society, including ultra-nationalism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and antisemitism, or we will be able to fight this horrific tendency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report comes just over three months after Anders Breivik, a supporter of hard right groups, shot dead 69 people at youth camp near Oslo. While he was disowned by the parties, police examination of his contacts highlighted the Europe-wide online discussion of anti-immigrant and nationalist ideas.</p>
<p>Data in the study was mainly collected in July and August, before the worsening of the eurozone crisis. The report highlights the prevalence of anti-immigrant feeling, especially suspicion of Muslims. &#8220;As antisemitism was a unifying factor for far-right parties in the 1910s, 20s and 30s, Islamophobia has become the unifying factor in the early decades of the 21st century,&#8221; said Thomas Klau from the European Council on Foreign Relations, who will speak at Monday&rsquo;s conference.</p>
<p>Parties touting anti-immigrant and Islamophobic ideas have spread beyond established strongholds in France, Italy and Austria to the traditionally liberal Netherlands and Scandinavia, and now have significant parliamentary blocs in eight countries. Other nations have seen the rise of nationalist street movements like the English Defence League (EDL). But, experts say, polling booths and demos are only part of the picture: online, a new generation is following these organisations and swapping ideas, particularly through Facebook. For most parties the numbers online are significantly bigger than their formal membership.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is sometimes difficult to pin down given the guises under which such groups operate. At one end are parties like France&rsquo;s National Front, a significant force in the country&rsquo;s politics for 25 years and seen as a realistic challenger in next year&rsquo;s presidential election. At the other are semi-organised street movements like the EDL, which struggles to muster more than a few hundred supporters for occasional demonstrations, or France&rsquo;s Muslim-baiting Bloc Indentitaire, best known for serving a pork-based &#8220;identity soup&#8221; to homeless people.</p>
<p>Others still take an almost pick-and-mix approach to ideology; a number of the Scandinavian parties which have flourished in recent years combine decidedly left-leaning views on welfare with vehement opposition to all forms of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Youth, Demos found, was a common factor. Facebook&rsquo;s own advertising tool let Demos crunch data from almost 450,000 supporters of the 14 organisations. Almost two-thirds were aged under 30, against half of Facebook users overall. Threequarters were male, and more likely than average to be unemployed.</p>
<p>The separate anonymous surveys showed a repeated focus on immigration, specifically a perceived threat from Muslim populations. This rose with younger supporters, contrary to most previous surveys which found greater opposition to immigration among older people. An open-ended question about what first drew respondents to the parties saw Islam and immigration listed far more often than economic worries. Answers were sometimes crude  &mdash;  &#8220;The foreigners are slowly suffocating our lovely country. They have all these children and raise them so badly,&#8221; went one from a supporter of the Danish People&rsquo;s Party. Others argued that Islam is simply antithetical to a liberal democracy, a view espoused most vocally by Geert Wilders, the Dutch leader of the Party for Freedom, which only six years after it was founded is the third-biggest force in the country&rsquo;s parliament.</p>
<p>This is a &#8220;key point&#8221; for the new populist-nationalists, said Matthew Goodwin from Nottingham University, an expert on the far right. &#8220;As an appeal to voters, it marks a very significant departure from the old, toxic far-right like the BNP. What some parties are trying to do is frame opposition to immigration in a way that is acceptable to large numbers of people. Voters now are turned off by crude, blatant racism  &mdash;  we know that from a series of surveys and polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;[These groups are] saying to voters: it&rsquo;s not racist to oppose these groups if you&rsquo;re doing it from the point of view of defending your domestic traditions. This is the reason why people like Geert Wilders have not only attracted a lot of support but have generated allies in the mainstream political establishment and the media.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the poll shows economics playing a minimal role, analysts believe the eurozone crisis is likely to boost recruitment to anti-EU populist parties which are keen to play up national divisions. &#8220;Why do the Austrians, as well as the Germans or the Dutch, constantly have to pay for the bottomless pit of the southern European countries?&#8221; asked Heinz-Christian Strache, head of the Freedom Party of Austria, once led by the late Jörg Haider. Such parties have well over doubled their MPs around western Europe in a decade. &#8220;What we have seen over the past five years is the emergence of parties in countries which were traditionally seen as immune to the trend  &mdash;  the Sweden Democrats, the True Finns, the resurgence of support for the radical right in the Netherlands, and our own experience with the EDL,&#8221; said Goodwin.</p>
<p>The phenomenon was now far beyond a mere protest vote, he said, with many supporters expressing worries about national identity thus far largely ignored by mainstream parties.</p>
<p>Gavan Titley, an expert on the politics of racism in Europe and co-author of the recent book The Crises of Multiculturalism, said these mainstream politicians had another responsibility for the rise of the new groups, by too readily adopting casual Islamophobia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The language and attitudes of many mainstream parties across Europe during the &#8216;war on terror&rsquo;, especially in its early years, laid the groundwork for much of the language and justifications that these groups are now using around the whole idea of defending liberal values  &mdash;  from gender to freedom of speech,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Racist strategies constantly adapt to political conditions, and seek new sets of values, language and arguments to make claims to political legitimacy. Over the past decade, Muslim populations around Europe, whatever their backgrounds, have been represented as the enemy within or at least as legitimately under suspicion. It is this very mainstream political repertoire that newer movements have appropriated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie Bartlett of Demos, the principal author of the report, said it was vital to track the spread of such attitudes among the new generation of online activists far more numerous than formal membership of such parties. &#8220;There are hundreds of thousands of them across Europe. They are disillusioned with mainstream politics and European political institutions and worried about the erosion of their cultural and national identity, and are turning to populist movements, who they feel speak to these concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;These activists are largely out of sight of mainstream politicians, but they are motivated, active, and growing in size. Politicians across the continent need to sit up, listen and respond.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Moslems are not being represented as the enemy; they are representing themselves as the enemy.  Most in Europe appear to live in conclaves, refuse to adopt the particular nation&rsquo;s culture, and threaten Europeans with dhimmitude.  Anyone with a spine would resist this!<br/>
Apparently, young people in Europe are not cowed by allusions to the Nazis, as were some of the older generations.  And what sensible person will believe that it&rsquo;s okay for non-whites to have ethnic pride, but not okay for whites?  Even most of the liberals who spout it don&rsquo;t really believe it.</p>

<p><br/>
Never heard of this group Bloc Indentitaire before   &mdash;   but what a brilliant idea! Not that the homeless are any sort of desirable demographic to add to our ranks, but it&rsquo;s a PR stunt that would have to bring at least partly positive media attention. The MSM would predictably condemn the &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; of this act, but the condemnation couldn&rsquo;t be complete because of the charity-for-the-homeless aspect of the gesture. </p>

<p>Lenin, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Perons, every dictator makes lists of enemies to eliminate once they get in power.</p>
<p>Once in power, every dictator ceaselessly searches for dissidents and eliminates them.  The internet activists need to be careful of the door crashing on at 3/am.  I understand that Lenin established the gulag as early as 1919.  Do the liberals have a gulag ready for the nationalist dissidents?  I would not be surprised.</p>
<p>I lived in Europe when it was the common market.  Northerners spoke of the PIGS. Portugual, Italy, Greece and Spain.  Northerners predicted that those countries would destroy the common market and European Union within 100 years.  The prediction has come true 70 years early.<br/>

		<p>Consider the source of this article, the left.  Anything the right does that isn&rsquo;t spineless capitulation to their agenda is &#8220;far right extremism&#8221; (and every other negative term they can think to throw at it).<br/>
And naturally for them, they are in complete denial that a re-emergence of nationalism is a direct and entirely appropriate response to the left&rsquo;s own historic extremism that has gone virtually unchecked in Western countries for the last fifty years.  Any resistance to their onslaught of bigotry against historic majorities is labeled &#8220;extremism&#8221;, whatever-phobia, blah, blah, blah.  It&rsquo;s complete nonsense.</p>

<p>I remember that incident.  A coalition of imams, rabbis and the French equivalent of the ADL got together and denounced the serving of this tasty pork, turnip, onion, leek, carrot, and potato soup as both islamaphobic and anti Semitic.</p>
<p>Jews arrived in France with the Romans. For 2,000 years they managed to co exist with the pork eaters.  Now they join with the Muslims to denounce pork.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the pork soup was served by Le Pen&rsquo;s nationalist party.  </p>

		<p>Europe&rsquo;s future is looking good, as nationalists continue to gain support.  Nationalist parties are within striking distance of forming governments in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France.  As the article notes, the &#8220;far right&#8221; in Europe is supported disproportionally by younger people.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile in America, we can&rsquo;t get the GOP leadership so come out straightforwardly against illegal immigration, let alone legal immigration.  The &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; is mostly made up of people (often much)over 50.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they have been brainwashed to be ashamed of asserting their rights in their own country!

Every skinhead I&rsquo;ve every met, including some Russian ones here were more akin to pagan war god mentality and had no fealty to Christianity in their symbols or attitudes, even when sporting the cross pattee.

		<p>Interesting to see how The Guardian and its weekend version The Observer kept our latest UK immigration-control scandal from its &#8220;liberal&#8221; readership, until TV publicity and other papers forced them to do so, though like their partner in crime, The [so-called] Independent, they have managed to turn it on inside pages into an attack on the so-called Conservative govt. The Guardian editorial (November 8) typically warns that the &#8220;crisis rhetoric of almost all political discussion of migration is gravely damaging&#8221; because it &#8220;undermines public  confidence&#8221; and recruits the &#8220;extreme right&#8221;; the &#8220;conversation about immigration must grow up&#8221;! There has been no grown-up permissible national political DEBATE about immigration for half a century.</p>

<p>Jack replies - this is an excellent propaganda deed. WN in the United States need to get out from just typing on a computer key board to do exciting, positive street actions. And helping local poor homeless people. feeding them in a politically incorrect, anti Islamic immigrant way - what could be better than that? This puts the PC multi cults in power - puts them in the position of trying to ban patriots from trying to feed/help homeless people. That&rsquo;s a win win for us - let&rsquo;s do it. And it&rsquo;s always a great idea to support local, pro White charities - there are poor White people in your area that could use some help, you won&rsquo;t become a socialist if you help local people, and even if you do become a little socialist, it will be in a White socialist way.</p>

		<p>Some here have lauded the relative youth of the European &#8220;far right.&#8221;  </p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m definitely glad for the help, I don&rsquo;t think the populist-nationalist wing of European politics will really start seeing real success until they have some age diversity.  I used to be young, and back in those days, I was hesitant about political movements and organizations that were replete with younger people.  Something instinctually warned me inside that I shouldn&rsquo;t bother if the movement or organization doesn&rsquo;t have its fair share of people with predominately silver hair running things.  As I came to learn, a really good org needs an additional fair share of middle aged people with a little bit of silver in their hair as sort of a middle management.  An org with 99% young people and an older leader, without any middle aged middle management, is also to be avoided (think:  Pierce).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I like about AR:  You have every age of posters (who have admitted their ages) from mid-teens to seventies.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at a crossroads in European history,&rdquo; said Emine Bozkurt, a Dutch MEP who heads the anti-racism lobby at the European parliament. &ldquo;In five years&rsquo; time we will either see an increase in the forces of hatred and division in society, including ultra-nationalism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and antisemitism, or we will be able to fight this horrific tendency.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, this is just absolutely brilliant. Who was it who relentlessly attacked all the elements of unity in Europe - family, religion and nation? Who goes on and on about the joys of diversity and promotes atomistic individual identity? Hint: Not the so-called far right. As for hatred, that&rsquo;s a case of pot calling kettle black. Every movement has its hateful members and every movement likes to accuse others of being hateful. It&rsquo;s all nothing but tiresome bleating.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;France&rsquo;s Muslim-baiting Bloc Indentitaire, best known for serving a pork-based &ldquo;identity soup&rdquo; to homeless people.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a smart stunt. Especially since the Quran (or was it in some Hadith collection?) explicitly allows eating of forbidden foods in the case nothing else is available. Muslim who goes hungry can eat that pork soup with no problems, and if he decides to eat elsewhere, then what&rsquo;s exactly his problem? What BI did wasn&rsquo;t even discriminatory. Not that the clueless liberals, clueless Muslims or most likely BI knew that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Others still take an almost pick-and-mix approach to ideology; a number of the Scandinavian parties which have flourished in recent years combine decidedly left-leaning views on welfare with vehement opposition to all forms of multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>This just goes to show the author knows nothing about Scandinavia. Traditionally this area has been egalitarian, communal, and fiercely nationalistic. &#8220;We take care of our own&#8221; might be a good slogan. It&rsquo;s not pick-and-mix. It&rsquo;s just Nordic version of paleoconservatism, to give a rough metaphor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gavan Titley, an expert on the politics of racism in Europe and co-author of the recent book The Crises of Multiculturalism, said these mainstream politicians had another responsibility for the rise of the new groups, by too readily adopting casual Islamophobia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, right. I&rsquo;m sure this is why the Neo-Nazis are strongest in Sweden and Germany, both nations which have been by far the most strident in preventing any real nationalism from entering politics and public discourse. Of course you can deter people from trying to solve problems through politics, but the thing is, then some of them will try to to solve things through violence. The best deterrent against violent extremism is an accepted political party.</p>
<p>&hellip;well, unless the party in question is tolerant and understanding about its kind of extremists. It&rsquo;s starting to look like we have a situation like this in Finland with Green Alliance and Left Alliance parties.</p>
<p>highduke,</p>
<p>&#8220;When far-right activity is represented by &lsquo;web-based young men&rsquo; we can be sure that we&rsquo;re talking about *virgin geek pagans* and that&rsquo;s EXACTLY who you attract when you make a sick fetish out of IQ even though it has ZERO survival &amp; spiritual value to your people. When you have 15 000 violent skinheads marching in your capaital like Moscow then you prove me wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you, but I&rsquo;ll pass. I don&rsquo;t want serial-killer Neo-Nazi gangs rampaging through streets, posting beheading videos on Internet like jihadis and shouting their contempt at judges. Unlike Russia, we&rsquo;ll do this the civilized way, and leave whatever violence is necessary to the professionals at police and army. If possible, anyway. For now, it still is.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/nwHxK" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/nwHxK</a></p>
<p>As for &#8220;virgin geek pagan&#8221; being somehow typical representative of Internet-exploiting community, it&rsquo;s just not true. Not when cheap Internet access is pretty much omnipresent.</p>
<p>The other thing you need to consider that the kind of person who&rsquo;d become WN in USA will typically become an ethnonationalist in Europe. Finn, Swiss, Hungarian or whatever. White nationalists in Europe tend to be either skinheads (some OK, many low-IQ with impulse control problems) or tinfoilhat anti-Semites. There simply isn&rsquo;t an intellectual and civilized WN tradition in Europe like that typified by AmRen, and for the foreseeable future there won&rsquo;t be one either. As such, 15 000 skinheads marching through an European capital city is like 15 000 ghetto gangstas or Islamists doing the same, the only real difference being that the barbarians marching are of your own race. Hellfire and damnation on that.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t got much palpable support beyond the internet so far.  You&rsquo;re very proud of Slavs because you&rsquo;re a Slav (and I have Russian grandparents), but you are working far too hard at knocking these guys than seems justified. You seem to be doing a lot of unnecessary chest pounding for us here.</p>
<p>Russians have a long history of tolerating intolerance (if I may for a moment, folks).  This gives your 15,000 Russian pagans some cultural and popular support, while it&rsquo;s been really beaten down and out of Euros in the West.  Interesting that it is Socialism/communism products acting (or expressing) very different outcomes.  Rather proves that culture and background has more to do with political expression of ideas than the actual protocols of an ideology.  </p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m the one who has for years been telling the Amren community that Pre-Christian European religions are best for saving the West.  I&rsquo;m also the one who countered your IQ rant as well.  Try getting anything done without intelligence on your side!  Get over the idea that it can only be one way.  So I don&rsquo;t wish to take anything away from those Russians in the streets trying to save their race and culture.  With a little more thought, you might become more supportive of the fledgling Western nationalists.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an east/west contest.</p>

		<p>You need a multi-pronged campaign - streets, media, lobbying, front organisations, internet, infiltration, &c.;<br/>
Not sure we must have &#8220;pre-Christian pagan religions&#8221;.  If you don&rsquo;t believe in God or even if you do, you aren&rsquo;t likely to believe in Odin and Valhalla, or Zeus and Olympus.  <br/>
Why waste energy on another sectarian war? Just defend religious freedom against both shariah totalitarians and those &#8220;liberals&#8221; who use multiculturalism solely to destroy churches, whose family values they particularly despise, and to replace homosexuality as an activity permitted only to consenting adults in private.<br/>
Just concentrate on publicising and defending the whole great European heritage - artistic, musical, intellectual, military, scientific (whether or not much of its best work was Christian), and on preserving the race that produced this civilization, especially our most creative technological elite.<br/>
White Nationalists can debate the respective merits or existence of Jesus or Jupiter, Mimir or Mithras, Prime Mover or No-one At All, AFTER political victory.</p>
