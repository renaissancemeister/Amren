<h1>To Promote Diversity, Schools Should Make Students Sit Together</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Elizabeth Laferriere, Policymic, November 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This month&rsquo;s Teacher Diversity Matters report by the Center for American Progress has added to the growing belief that a racially diverse student body and faculty have positive effects on various educational outcomes for students. Children need to learn how to adapt and interact within a diverse environment. They benefit from broad perspectives and new opinions. </p>
<p>A more pressing concern for policymakers and teachers alike is how to effectively capture and channel the positive influences from diversity. Primarily, does enforcing intermingling and cross-ethnic communication help, hinder, or bring no net change to diversification efforts?</p>
<p>Some argue that encouraging intermingling like forcing primary schoolers of different ethnicities to sit together might do more harm than good. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One serious hindrance to performance for certain groups of individuals, from women to minorities, is what social psychologists like Harvard&rsquo;s Claude Steele deem the stereotype threat: a quantifiable devaluation in performance of some task due to pressure from the belief that others have prejudged us and will make future judgments based on these beliefs and not on individual capabilities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By encouraging young, multi-ethnic students to sit together every day, to team them up, to have assigned seating at lunch, and give them joint projects, this generation of teachers may potentially issue a fatal blow to the threat before it has materialized as an actual and long-lasting hindrance to performance. If impressionable young students are constantly forced into interactions with others, they will be more likely to see similarities and less likely to unquestioningly internalize otherwise common prejudices. This in turn could help ensure their own fully-realized performance if they believe others are less likely to harbor such prejudice towards them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The implications going forward are clear: the education system faces serious, albeit unavoidable, challenges in addressing diversity. Yet, encouraging and channeling the benefits of such bountiful diversity may be the source of one of the American school system&rsquo;s greatest untapped strengths. </p>

		<p>Would this new regime apply to lunch tables as well as classrooms?  Because I can tell you this:  Fisticuffs will reign if the races are forced to eat together.  Not that the white students want fights.  But the menacing, aggressive behavior on the part of the blacks will make this inevitable.  </p>

The &#8216;multi-culti&rsquo; crowd believe than by some mysterious form of absorption the PROVEN lower-achievement group will benefit by proximity to the higher achievers.

		<p>I`ll never forget the &#8220;new&#8221; kid in sixth grade. He looked like me, dressed like me, acted like me and saw his sixth grade world from my point of view. We were fast friends by lunchtime and partied for the next twenty -five years. I don`t think it would have worked out at all that way if I hadn`t &#8220;pre-judged&#8221; him as &#8220;one of us&hellip;&#8221; </p>

		<p>Maybe the schools should stop their never ending social engineering and concentrate on actually teaching science, math, geography and language skills.  Maybe we should stop passing all these SPLOST tax measures that are helping to fund school systems that have way too many administrators and diversity experts with time to worry about who is sitting next to whom in the cafeteria. </p>

		<p>I saw the results of such integration last week in a 3rd grade classroom (9-10 year olds):</p>
<p>Bob (white student): Look at the cool stuffed dog!!!<br/>
Sally (white student): I want to pet the doggie!!!<br/>
Mary (white student):  Ain&rsquo;t it cute!!!<br/>
Dontavius (black male student, grabbing the dog and doing pelvic thrusts):  Watch me have sex with that animal&hellip;</p>
<p>The names have been changed, but if I had a white 9 year old girl in this class I would be very worried.  Home school your kids or send them to a private school or this is what they will learn in the 3rd grade from their &#8220;diverse&#8221; classmates.</p>

		<p>The Marxists with their totalitarianism again. One might simply ask &#8220;why don&rsquo;t you leave us alone?&#8221; The answer to that question is that the anti-humans want to destroy Western Civilization to replace it with&hellip;.? What? </p>
<p>Clearly they must have ideas about their utopia, but the Titanic keeps crashing against the icebergs of reality. I would like to see the look on their faces when the first black or Hispanic parent complains that their kid sitting next to a White kid is causing them to fail. The blacks and Hispanics will then demand their own charter schools with same ethnicity teachers since the little tykes can&rsquo;t learn around white civilization.</p>

		<p>More diversity forced on our children. It&rsquo;s not enough that the workforce has to be diverse, but now our kids get to enjoy diversity first hand. </p>
<p>This will backfire quickly, but not quickly enough. It is unfortunate that not all white families have the luxury of homeschooling their children. Maybe they are hoping this will bridge the achievment gap by dragging down white education to the level of minorities. Now instead of whites doing better than minorities everyone will do equally bad. Equality at last.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    This &#8216;need&rsquo; is only because the same liberals are forcing the racial change of the country.  So they flood the nation with non-whites of every type, along with spreading the urban blacks around, and then the whites are forced at ever younger ages to get used to them, because no matter what they try, the bulk of the whites always flee further away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some argue that encouraging intermingling like forcing primary schoolers of different ethnicities to sit together might do more harm than good.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;   So true.  I have voluminous experience about what happens when you place a clever kid with a dullard.  The slow kid gets all self-conscious and acts out, realizing he cannot perform to the level of his peer.  That&rsquo;s one reason why our schools have turned into zoos.  </p>
<p>Posters #1 and #2 have identified the reason why myself, and tens of thousands of other parents pay the &#8216;white tax&rsquo; and put our kids in private schools.  I work with black and brown teenagers all day long.  The depravity and immorality are off the charts!  Nohing but sex jokes, foul language, emotional outbursts, cheating and general mayhem ALL DAY LONG.  Even the ones considered &#8216;good&rsquo; are straight out of sodom and gamoreh!</p>

		<p>So do they thing that the white&rsquo;normal&rsquo; behavior will magically rub off on the low-performing black students? This will usually lead to more white-flight, because the black kids will just make learning impossible, now that they have a new playmate. Its like a bad game of musical chairs, to try and get over human nature. </p>

		<p>You can see how these adults go beyond merely teaching the children entrusted to them to attempting to brainwash them, to inculcate an outlook independent of what the parents may think. These are the kinds of people who try to infiltrate the educational system to implement their goals. Your children are just to be used as their guinea pigs.</p>

<p>Media bombardment of diversity propaganda failed. Classroom indoctrination failed. Now it&rsquo;s time to use physical force.</p>
<p>The entire concept of &#8216;liberalism&rsquo; revolves around using force. It demands that people act against their natural instincts to appease the egos of an academic elite. When reality doesn&rsquo;t fit with theory then it&rsquo;s reality that has to change.</p>
<p>Strangely the academic&rsquo;s own children are never forced to attend these Orwellian gulags of brainwashing. You see, those children are raised with the &#8216;correct&rsquo; attitudes so it&rsquo;s all right if they go to all White schools. It&rsquo;s everybody else&rsquo;s children who need to unlearn what their parents have taught them.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. What &#8220;growing belief&#8221; is the author speaking about? This is the worst kind of editorializing - it is not backed up by any data or outcomes - just a liberal nod to what apparently is a &#8220;growing belief&#8221; among blacks who cannot compete with white students.</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I just fail to see the benefit of subjecting white kids to daily mandated harrassment by blacks and having the overall learning environment dumbed down to the point of no-point by large numbers of uncurious, unintelligent hispanics.</p>
<p>When will educational bureaucrats  &mdash;  some of the most stubbornly sanctimonious losers a person can ever have the misery of dealing with  &mdash;  face up to the fact that black and brown people aren&rsquo;t going to get any smarter by sitting next to white kids?!</p>

		<p>I once had the &ldquo;privilege�? of observing two middle school classrooms in Rancho Cucamonga, California.  In the first classroom students were seated in &ldquo;collaborative�? groups of five.  In the groups closest to me white students were pressed by non-white &ldquo;peers�? into &ldquo;sharing�? their completed assignments prior to collection by the teacher.  Later on the teacher, a white woman, condescendingly explained that such &ldquo;knowledge sharing was part of the collaborative process.�?  In the second classroom students were seated at individual desks.  When the teacher called for assignments a black boy sitting across the aisle from a white girl near me began slapping her naked thighs with a ruler (she was wearing shorts) after she refused to hand over her homework (to copy).  I called the white teacher&rsquo;s attention to what was happening and the boy was promptly sent to the &ldquo;time-out room.�?  Prior to the end of the class session, however, the boy returned to a hero&rsquo;s welcome from his non-white peers.  In front of the teacher and myself he threatened the white girl with further harm, blaming her for having been caught.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how sheeply Americans accept forced school integration plus busing.  I live in Europe and the other day was talking to a Russian who moved to Germany 18 years ago and who previously lived in the Soviet Republic of Kazachistan. He told me that at school russians and the other ethnies had their own schools and could therefore mantain their own culture. Amerika it seems has gone even beyond Communism!  No normal White people would accept their children being exposed to such deleterious influences brought by forced integration.</p>

<p>Chinh: I got 100 percent last time but I need to stay for SATs; I know I&rsquo;m only in seventh grade but if I keep practicing, I&rsquo;ll get a 2400 by my sophomore year.</p>
<p>Jayden (white kid): I don&rsquo;t study. My parents are happy as long as I pass. I got a C +. I&rsquo;m gonna go home and watch basketball (or football). I wish I was black cuz Blacks are good at sports.</p>

		<p>Oddly enough, we tried this same experiment years ago at the Philadelphia elementary school at which I taught. As soon as the white kids had had their fill of getting kicked, pinched and threatened - and of doing all the work involved in &#8220;team&#8221; projects - as soon as their parents saw the end result of &#8220;effectively capturing and channeling the positive influences from diversity&#8221; and could see the final outcome of their kids&rsquo; &#8220;adapting and interacting within a diverse environment&#8221; - they yanked their young the hell out of our school and put them in charter schools or private schools. Today, my old school is entirely minority and has one of the worst reputations in a very lousy school district. </p>
<p>So much for &#8220;the benefits of bountiful diversity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The same thinking was responsible for making me spend about 90 minutes on a bus every day for two years when I was in the sixth and seventh grades in Tampa, Florida. Apparently, the nice suburb I lived in couldn&rsquo;t provide the, um, &#8216;variety&rsquo; that is obviously the basis for a good education so I had to get up around 6am to catch a bus for the 45min or so ride to Tampa. I saw things I had never seen before - school grounds locked down because police were chasing someone in the neighborhood, fights in the hallways, fights in the cafeteria, fights in classrooms, black students telling teachers exactly what they thought of them in very colorful language, used condoms on the &#8216;playground&rsquo;, teachers having to pause while the scream of police and ambulance sirens subsided, etc. I also actually got suspended from the bus for the first and only time in my life - a petty, meaningless dispute with a black girl over a seat caught the attention of the driver and she us both to the pricipal&rsquo;s office. The black girl did all of the talking/pushing/yelling but naturally we were both suspended. This was 30 years ago so she&rsquo;s probably a great-grandmother by now. Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure there are millions of whites who had similar or worse experiences with going to schools on the &#8220;other side of town&#8221;. The biggest lesson from mine is that I know that my opinion of blacks isn&rsquo;t based on a lack of contact with them. Thanks to the mindset of the do-gooders in the article, I know them all too well. </p>

		<p>&#8220;This month&rsquo;s Teacher Diversity Matters report by the Center for American Progress has added to the growing belief that a racially diverse student body and faculty have positive effects on various educational outcomes for students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such as?  And where, pray tell, is this evidence?</p>
<p>&#8220;Some argue that encouraging intermingling like forcing primary schoolers of different ethnicities to sit together might do more harm than good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some argue that forcing behavior onto children may cause harm?  You would have thought?</p>
<p>&#8220;If impressionable young students are constantly forced into interactions with others, they will be more likely to see <br/>
similarities and less likely to unquestioningly internalize otherwise common prejudices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually if impressionable young White and Asian students are &#8220;forced&#8221; into interactions with others it will just allow them to see the low IQ and problem-causing behavior of Black students early on.  If you force people like the author of this stupid piece to watch The Cosby Show as a child while having no interactions with Blacks as I imagine is true of her, they will see similarities only because Hollywood fiction replaces life experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;The implications going forward are clear: the education system faces serious, albeit unavoidable, challenges in addressing diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this woman an idiot?  She claims diversity is positive for educational outcomes without explaining how and concludes by stating that diversity faces serious challenges?  Is this real life?</p>

		<p>The opposite is what works. Having students sitting with their own kind, going to school with their own kind. They are more comfortable that way and  can learn much better. When they bus blacks into white schools, all it does is make it that much harder for white kids to learn and feel comfortable. Diversity ruins schools. And the white kids have to suffer the PC of it all. </p>
<p>Plus, this causes animosity between the races. They don&rsquo;t trust each other and whites become resentful( rightfully so) with being forced to endure that sort of garbage. Cultures clash and whites always have to pick up the pieces. </p>

<p>This is not a suggestion.  It is a mandate from the thought police of the NWO.  There are no &#8220;broad perspectives and new opinions&#8221; and that&rsquo;s not what this is about.  It is about conditioning children, especially White children, to become drones of a new state, with Whites as a powerless, leaderless minority at the bottom. (if Whites are allowed to exist in the New Amerikan Order).</p>
<p>Same reason Section 8 is forced into White neighborhoods; the aim  to destroy White areas.  Any objections?  You are a Nazi.  Your place is on the front line of the government&rsquo;s overseas wars.</p>
<p>There are no real world examples of a multicultural state that exists or has existed anywhere without a Powerful Central Government using strong-arm, police-state tactics to enforce order among different tribes, disparate races and cultures.  It didn&rsquo;t work in the Soviet Union and it won&rsquo;t work here.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the old Soviet order, when the lid lifted off the pressure cooker that was Eastern Europe, ethnic wars broke out across the former USSR as people rejected 70 years of forced multiculturalism imposed by the Kremlin and strove to sort themselves out along ethnic lines.</p>
<p><i>By the year 2000 – a mere 10-year stretch of the new era of peace and brotherly love – more than 100 wars broke out across the old Soviet Empire and more than 5 million people were killed.</i></p>

<p>These leftist half-measures are frustrating. The most obvious and economical way to enforce diversification mentality among young white and black students is to handcuff race members of each group together in pairs during school hours, thus giving them a long-term true sense of state imposed, crippled white-performance created harmony.</p>

		<p>Poster #19 mentioned some things he saw in a couple of classrooms.  Basically, blacks harassing whites and all students being forced to &#8216;collaborate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This collaboration nonsense is one of the biggest scams in education today.  I wish someone would expose this (and differentiation, and project based learning, etc).</p>
<p>Anyone born before 1990 or so, we had to learn to do things on our own.  Sink or swim.  Man up.  Remember those days?</p>
<p>Well, so many black and brown kids have been unable to close the gap - forced busing and integration didn&rsquo;t work, trillions in new dollars didn&rsquo;t work, new educational fads failed - that &#8216;reformers&rsquo; figured to let them do group work, because they could all help each other finish the work.  (Copying is basically all that goes on.  I see it every day.)<br/>
 <br/>
&#8216;Group work&rsquo; as a technique sounded rather embarassing, so they came up with the important-sounding name of &#8216;collaboration&rsquo; to describe the circle of copying.  As long as there were &#8216;differing ability levels&rsquo; in each group (read: make sure there&rsquo;s at least one smarter kid in the group) then a final &#8216;product&rsquo; would be completed, and everyone gets an &#8220;A&#8221;.</p>
<p>It goes along with their &#8216;social justice&rsquo; thing.  Smart kids are &#8216;priviledged&rsquo; and have an obligation to help their &#8216;disadvantaged&rsquo; peers.  This is in their literature about this practice.  No one can excel without dragging up everyone around them first.</p>
<p>To justify &#8216;collaborative&rsquo; projects, they spread the lie that the &#8216;workplace of the future&rsquo; will be collaborative.  They present staged photos of &#8216;diverse&rsquo; workers in an office all huddled around a computer and using their diversity as a strength to come up with &#8216;solutions&rsquo; from &#8216;unique&rsquo; perspectives.</p>
<p>Do you think this is how they work in China, Taiwan, Japan or even Germany?</p>
<p>We are doomed, my friends.</p>

		<p>Just more proof that diversity only occurs when it is forced among people. The lunchroom is one place where students get to sit with who they want to, and have a break before going back to their lessons. When i was in school, we got assigned seats when we threw food. If diversity is such a good idea, why then do people who are free to choose consistently choose to associate themselves with their own race?</p>

In fact, the brainwashing and trauma extends even to the staff. I worked in a Denver Public School in which certain &#8220;change agents&#8221; were actively promoting conflict on the staff through the DELPHI TECHNIQUE!

		<p>My experience in the Western New York region certainly adds to the traditionalist theory that diversity is really just another form of welfare.  The Liberal and increasingly Catholic and Christian perspectives emphasize getting as many different types of people into the &#8220;system&#8221; / school / university / employment / neighborhoods as possible, whether they have much to offer or not.  Unfortunately America in general has become too much of a drunken / drugged / sexual playground.  One theory is that when a large manufacturing base existed and unions were strong, families produced large numbers of offspring, regardless of their intelligence quotients or ability to offer something to society since the union would fight the company to extract as much money as possible for the workers to support their large families.  Now that manufacturing has mostly left the USA, their offspring are still here, partying and mostly liberal, influencing most segments of society, including the political parties and the election process.  It is no wonder America is in a decline that is likely unstoppable, as the 1960&rsquo;s liberalism with respect to immigration and civil rights laws guaranteed this type of system to self perpetuate and grow.   If you think I am exaggerating, come to Buffalo, New York and visit a restaurant called the &#8220;Left Bank.&#8221;  The &#8220;Left Bank&rsquo;s&#8221; men&rsquo;s room (my observation from when I visited one and only time) contains photos of dead communist leaders.  It is a hangout for lawyers and politicians and gives one the impression that liberals, while well meaning in many respects, are really just deceived individuals falling for a failed system called communism.    </p>

		<p>My son went through this process in the UK school system</p>
<p>By the time the kids got to high school they were hanging out with their own kind.<br/>
In the classroom it was a mixed environment but in the playground they stuck to their own ethnic groups.<br/>
After school there was zero social interaction as they went back to their own home environments.</p>
<p>So even with structures/rules/regulations/laws forcing integration the natural tendency is to be with your own kind</p>
<p>South Africa institutionalised this natural segregation in law and was condemned by the United Nations for perpetrating A Crime Against Humanity. Since the end of apartheid in 1990 and majority rule in 1994 black South Africans have demonstrated their willingness to integrate by murdering 40,000 whites in 17 years.</p>

		<p>Sam, I 100% agree with you.  Homeschooling is the way to go now, for White children.  We have to protect our youth.  I used to think that private school was a decent alternative to public schools, but to be honestly, the kids are no different!  They are just as misled, just as brainwashed, and don&rsquo;t give a darn about their race.  It is really a sad state of affairs.  Best thing is too keep your children home, and teach them Aryan values.</p>
