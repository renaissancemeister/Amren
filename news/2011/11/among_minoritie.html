<p>According to U.S. Census Bureau figures, the unemployment rate last year among high-school dropouts between ages 16 and 24 was 29%  &mdash;  up from 17.7% in 2000 and seven points higher than that of their peers who finished high school but didn&rsquo;t go on to college.</p>
<p>The problem is particularly acute among Hispanics and African-Americans. Several studies have found that only about 50% of black and Hispanic students graduate from high school, compared with 75% of white students.</p>
<p>Up to 40% of the young people in these communities qualify as &#8220;disconnected youth,&#8221; the term for young adults who are neither in school nor working, says David Dodson, president of MDC Inc., a research organization in Durham, N.C.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;ve given up hope,&#8221; says Phillip Jackson, executive director of Chicago&rsquo;s Black Star Project, which helps African-American youth stay in school. He estimates that 75% to 80% of the young black men in Chicago are jobless.</p>
<p>&#8220;It leads to violence, broken families and hyperincarceration,&#8221; for economic crimes that range from selling bootleg CDs to drug trafficking, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Andrew Sum, an economist at Northeastern University who studies disconnected youth, says dropouts will suffer a lifetime earnings loss of around $400,000 compared with high-school graduates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the only group with no net contribution to the fiscal well-being of state and national government,&#8221; says Mr. Sum.</p>

		<p>the problem with the census bureau figures, is that they don&rsquo;t matter.  even graduating from HS doesn&rsquo;t mean you can function literately anymore.  Maybe you were just able to sit quietly or could dribble well.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given up hope,&rdquo;   &mdash;  - wait, I thought obama brought the &#8216;audacity&rsquo; of hope!</p>
<p>Seriously, poster #1 hit the nail on the head.  I work in a high school with minority-majority &#8216;youths.&rsquo;  Nearly every single one of them are barely literate at about a second or third grade level.  The latino kids are a slight step up, but not by much.  </p>
<p>Most of my students have very poor manners and work habits.  Most are lazy beyond what you might expect from a typical 18-19 year old.  Most try to sneek a text message whenever possible, and when you sit them in front of a computer, they will mostly NOT do the work you assign, but will immediately go to music sites, triple x or social networking.  That&rsquo;s it.  </p>
<p>How can they expect to get or keep a job when they are mostly unemployable?  Then with all the uncontrolled immigration, who wouldn&rsquo;t hire an under the table mexican who will work for peanuts and give no trouble?</p>
<p>Add the fact that most low skill factory jobs went to poor asians and others around the world, and what jobs do we have left, for anybody?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve given up hope,&rdquo;  Then that&rsquo;s it, we need to instill more hope!  Give them money, housing and food and they still don&rsquo;t have hope.  Hope for what?  A better life by just being on the planet?  Maybe the system has it wrong.  Maybe if these kids knew that being on the dole had finite time limits and that hunger could result, they would spend less time hopeless and more time motivated to do something for themselves if not for others.  Society can only do so much, at some point personal responsibility is needed.  The excuse race.</p>

<p>There are plenty of high school dropouts who don&rsquo;t engage in violent or even white collar crime.</p>
<p><i>Andrew Sum, an economist at Northeastern University who studies disconnected youth, says dropouts will suffer a lifetime earnings loss of around $400,000 compared with high-school graduates.</i></p>
<p>Simple solution.  Give everyone a high school diploma upon turning 18, in case they don&rsquo;t &#8220;earn&#8221; one.  That way, poverty and criminality will disappear.  Don&rsquo;t you feel it, too?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This is the only group with no net contribution to the fiscal well-being of state and national government,&rdquo; says Mr. Sum.</i></p>
<p>Honestly, about the only group(s) who are net contributors are whites who are at least working middle class.</p>

<p>Maybe the WSJ is making the wrong comparison. Yes, the rates of black and hispanic youth unemployment are very high compared to whites   &mdash;   but for Mexico and Africa these figures are merely the status quo. Blacks and browns don&rsquo;t have impressive employment numbers in their own countries, and nothing about present-day socialized America forces them to amend their unambitious behavior patterns when they&rsquo;re here. </p>
<p>&#8220;Disconnected&#8221;? Well, that&rsquo;s a polite way of describing these yoofs, I suppose   &mdash;   although &#8220;lazy&#8221;, &#8220;dim-witted&#8221;, and &#8220;of no real use to society&#8221; might be more to the point. </p>

		<p>This is why I shake my head every time a minority activist says that the percentage of minority teachers should reflect the percentage of minority students. Forget college or grad school, you&rsquo;re never going to have a representative number of minority teachers when half of minorities don&rsquo;t even finish high school.</p>

		<p>As usual, the Wall Street Journal thinks an injection of &#8220;opportunity&#8221; will cure things.  Not so fast.  These people have been hospital-gurneyed all kinds of public and private-sector aid, to little or no avail.  </p>
<p>I speak from experience.  Back in grad school, I occasionally earned some extra money substitute-teaching mainly black and Hispanic suburban public high school students (aka &#8220;youths&#8221;).  Trust me, half of these kids literally could not read at a 3rd-grade level.  How they made it to high school is beyond me.  As for their being trapped in that public school   &mdash;   a common mantra put forth by &#8220;conservative&#8221; voucher enthusiasts.  I doubt it.  Their white peers at the same grade levels knew how to read.  </p>

<p>When I was a probation officer I wanted to get them sent to state prison where they belonged.  If they were younger mid thirties, the tax payer funded do gooder foundations mooching around the courthouse would set up an alternative program for them.</p>
<p>It usually involved enrolling in community college.</p>
<p>I anticipated this, so I had them tested.  3rd grade reading and math were the highest I remember.  1st, 2nd and 3rd grade level was the norm.  </p>
<p>I sent a lot of thugs to state prison instead of continued probation by getting their reading levels tested.</p>
<p>The Judge would read the community organization&rsquo;s glowing report about turning his life around, getting his GED and enrolling in community college.  Then he would read my report asking how anyone with a 2nd grade reading level could pass the GED test?</p>
<p>They have wonderful remedical and GED programs in state prisons.</p>
<p>I would always win.</p>

		<p>This is the plan that our elected officials have for us: <br>
 <br>
1)  Ship all manufacturing overseas, so that there are exceedingly few jobs for low-skilled workers.</p>
<p>2) Use welfare, food stamps, Section 8 housing, and cradle-to-grave free health care to encourage massive irresponsible breeding by low-IQ people, in order to increase their abundance.</p>
<p>3) Import millions of low-skilled, low-IQ Third World people.</p>
<p>Now we have a perfect combination for destroying America   &mdash;   a hundred million angry, non-educatable, low-IQ, low-skilled, unemployed people who can never, never, never find work   &mdash;   because we shipped all the mindless manufacturing jobs to China.   And who is to blame?  Why you   &mdash;   you racist, employed White person, who used &#8220;White privlege&#8221; to excell in school, learn a trade, start a business, etc.  </p>

		<p>Perhaps the most succinct definition of the academic &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;   &mdash;  - which goes a long way in explaining the &#8220;employment gap&#8221;   &mdash;  - was furnished by Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Education Trust, &ldquo;Closing the Achievement Gap,&rdquo; National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>
http://tinyurl.com/2d6sayq</p>
<p>Note the conditional &ldquo;if they do so [reach 12th grade] at all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Those words means that the black-white achievement gap is &ldquo;four years&rdquo; for the above-average contingent of black students still in school by 12th grade. The below-average contingent of black students (half of the age cohort) have already dropped out. </p>
<p>COMMENT: While it may be correct to place most blame on heredity, low-investing parenting (which may be partly hereditary) and a highly dysgenic welfare state, the protected monopoly structure of schooling in America is a not insignificant factor.  Because of intervention in schooling   &mdash;  - from all levels of government   &mdash;  - education in America is much worse than it would be if left to citizen initiative. Public schooling is, in fact, part of the aforesaid welfare state.</p>

		<p>So what if they can&rsquo;t read. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;d read &#8220;War and Peace&#8221; if they could. By that age they should already be out and working in the fields or factories. But Mexicans have all those jobs so we babysit them in high school and pretend they&rsquo;re educable.</p>

		<p>Recently, I read that the solution to this problem would be for the U.S. to return to a manufacturing based economy. All of these minority youth could be employed making products like we did before the beginning of de-industrializaion around 1970.<br>
Require the firms to pay good wages &amp; benefits, make advancement opportunities possible, foster continuing education, training etc. And yes, have the government ie taxpayer guarentee it!<br>
Sounds good, but look at the total picture. Why did these firms leave in the first place? Unions, government regulations, NGO pressures, etc. Add poor quality, high prices, terrible service &amp; pathetic workers &amp; no wonder the corporations went abroad. <br>
Even if the U.S. would ever have a manufacturing revival (highly unlikely), the need for employees would be far less than they were 40 years ago. Advancements in technology have warrented that aspect. Besides such workers would require skills, training physical &amp; mental aptitudes that far far exceed those of a tradition assembly line worker circa 1950. Besides these youth with their poor life habits &amp; lack of work ethic wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance in such enviroment to begin with. Nice idea in theory but so was the welfare state and look at the mess it caused.<br>

<p>It is no wonder I have given up hope - - these problems will never be solved! Only be there, fester, get worse, and if better not that much better, just goes on and on and on.</p>

		<p>with average IQs around 85, only a small % of blacks can do high school work.</p>
<p>If 50% get diplomas, that can only mean the standards are abominably low.</p>
<p>blacks and whites and all others of limited mental powers need training in trades they can make a living at.</p>
<p>blacks are the victims of the insane philosophy that keeps them in school years after they have absorbed all they can.</p>

		<p>The only hope for these low-IQ ethnicities is to go back to having the kind of schools they did before desegregation.  I don&rsquo;t imagine that black teachers and principals put up with bad behavior, and the lessons can be tailored for non-intellectual pupils.  If students of any race couldn&rsquo;t behave decades ago, they ended up in reform school, the army, or prison.  Teens who couldn&rsquo;t learn simply quit school and went to work  &mdash;  which blacks would have a lot more of if it weren&rsquo;t for illegal Hispanics.  <br>
I say pitch some big tents and get out the chain gangs.</p>

		<p>And this is while whites will go into $100,000 in debt to get into the most prestigious liberal Ivy League universities. This kind of SWPL might have 1 child, if any, while the &#8220;stupid minorities&#8221; get real jobs and have 4-7 children.</p>
<p>The minorities figured out the academia scam before whites, and have learned how to best exploit a corrupt welfare system to benefit their children, good for them.</p>

		<p>My kids go to a school that&rsquo;s 80 percent minority but it has test scores that AVERAGE in the 95th percentile and above. Students who study calculus their freshman year and NEVER even THINK about talking back to a teacher. </p>
<p>The secret is that the school is virtually all Asian. You teachers ought to try teaching in an Asian school. Not all &#8216;minorities&rsquo; are low IQ, loudmouth, obnoxious brats.</p>

		<p>Last night I happened to scan past a network program with newscaster Brian Williams.  He was doing a special on the Eugenics craze that led to a policy of sterilization for poor, government dependent people in the distant past, I think something like 1930s to the 1950s.  Featured (for the short while I watched it) was a black woman in North Carolina who told her story.  She was from a home of multiple siblings, her mom was in jail, baby daddy gone, grandma raising her.  She alleges that she was raped and then given what sounds like a cesarean section delivery, and had her reproductive organs removed at the same time.  Brian Williams blamed Eugenics and the bigotry of the times for the terrible tribulations that she and many poor, black and white during this period who had this done.  Yet, it was so very plain that now, after more than 50 years since that policy has been ended, we have the national product to show.  All that program and this article proves to me is another bit of evidence of the truth of the eugenic model for a successful society.</p>

		<p>I think we (racial realists) should be more aggressive with these numbers.  The number one problem and fixable solution with regard to the decline of white Americans is immigration.  It can theoretically be fixed in a few days with a conservative Congress and a concerted effort by a strong and sensible president.  However, cheap-labor immigration won&rsquo;t end until the costs are fully flushed out for the smart business types to appreciate.  The fact is, the US is having trouble developing economically when too much capital is spent subsidizing black crime and paying for illegals&rsquo; health care and education.</p>

The laws are written in their favor, they can get jobs/scholarships just because they&rsquo;re non white, but a majority of black/hispanic &#8216;youths&rsquo; commit crimes because it&rsquo;s in their nature or because their communities tolerate it and excuse it.  There were tons of unemployed and destitute whites during the 30s who not only couldn&rsquo;t find work, but there was no safety net then (welfare, social security, medicare, etc), or a provider in their family died/couldn&rsquo;t work and then there was the Dust Bowl which hit an already impoverished farming community.  Whites didn&rsquo;t go out and rape and steal and loot.  It&rsquo;s another excuse by marxists and militant blacks to excuse their bad behavior.</p>

<p>Hyperincarceration?!  Great, I thought they had enough problems with <i>regular</i> incarceration.  Now we need new words to describe how easily blacks are &#8220;led&#8221; to incarceration.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Disconnected&#8221;, &#8220;hyperincarceration&#8221;, &#8220;disenfranchised&#8221;, &#8220;underachieving&#8221; &hellip;we must continually invent new ways to describe minority dysfunction.  </p>
<p>Also, they aren&rsquo;t getting thrown in jail for bootlegging CD&rsquo;s unless they&rsquo;re already on probation for a much more serious crime.  Anyone who&rsquo;s worked around the court system knows it&rsquo;s hard enough getting them thrown in jail for car theft or burglary!<br>

<p>Even during the heady days of manufacturing where you had thousands of men pouring in and out of a factory when the whistle blew, blacks generally didn&rsquo;t make very good employees.  I can count five relatives who worked on the line at A-B, and they all tell stories about how lazy and shiftless the black workers were, most didn&rsquo;t last very long.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of this &#8220;they need hope&#8221; tripe in articles.  Underclass black teens are the most hopeful people I&rsquo;ve every met.  They&rsquo;re all convinced that they&rsquo;re going to grow up to be rich and famous, hence all the &#8220;aspiring rapper&#8221; and &#8220;wanted to play in the NBA&#8221; stuff you read in their homicide obituaries.  Even the least attractive females plan to be music video dancers or marry rich athletes.  They may be unintelligent, but they have lots of hope!  <br>

<p>Non-whites don&rsquo;t have the brains for academia, cannot compete and are unsuccessful.  They also have little to no understanding of economics; only that housing, food, education, medical services, transportation are free.</p>
<p>Yes, good for them for playing the role of government useful idiots against white America, for being a part of a government-created, unsustainable system that is destined to crash as government/welfare-dependent &#8220;minorities&#8221; overbreed and overwhelm the taxpaying base with their demands for money earned by other people.  They are tools of the government, believing the marxist lies that Whites made them poor, stole from them and are &#8220;hoarding&#8221; all the wealth, keeping &#8220;their fair share&#8221; from them.  </p>
<p>The 20% of the population that creates 80% of the wealth are being out-taxed and out-voted at the polls.  Now What?</p>
<p>What do you think will happen when the entire economic system implodes and the &#8220;EBT cards stop working?&#8221; </p>
<p>I predict violence.  And lots of it.  Directed at those the government is busy dehumanizing:  White Americans.</p>

<p>Wait a year, check the afro american box, download the black appropriate poor, poor pitiful me essay from the internet and you get early acceptance, a full scholarship and letters from every employer around first semester of your senior year begging you to come work for them.</p>
<p>I did it to get a job. It worked fine.  The day after I gave them the application I got a phone call next day.  Can you come in for an interview.  I still have the job.</p>
<p>I advise everyone I know to to do this.</p>

<p>Assembly line work requires concentration which is way beyond blacks.  Also one can&rsquo;t wave the arms about, jump back and forth and babble and screech  mindlessly as blacks do.</p>
<p>The arm waving is just not compatible with using one&rsquo;s hands for any kind of work, let alone an assembly line.</p>

<p>A very good point.  Young blacks are full of irrational hope, apparently believing that they&rsquo;ll become successful and accomplished (usually in entertainment) simply by some process of watching TV, shuckin&rsquo; and jivin&rsquo;, or some other means of strange osmotic absorption.</p>
<p>When they reach young adulthood and the presumptive &#8220;process&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t worked for them they become disillusioned and embittered.<br>
So you&rsquo;re right - they have plenty of hope.  What they lack is any appreciation of the hard work and discipline required to turns dreams into reality.</p>
<p>Good point, and one which should be made emphatically and often to ghetto youth.</p>

<p>Sureesh you must know by now that when ever there is an article about the disfunctions of blacks and hispanics the code word to disguise their race is &#8220;minority&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as we know that when the race of the criminal is not mentioned in a crime article that is code for black criminal.</p>
<p>You are racially aware and like to write.  It would help your, the asians and our causes if you would write a letter to both the editor and the reporter.  </p>
<p>Let them know  that the minority kids in your kids school are super smart, that you  live and work in a job and neighborhood surrounded by well paid super achieving minorities and wonder why just being a minority causes all these Chicago thugs to be such disfunctional criminals.<br>

		<p>&#8220;blacks and whites and all others of limited mental powers need training in trades they can make a living at.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is the black IQ of 85 the median or the average?  If it is the median, half of them have IQs below 85.  If it is the average, a large number of them have IQs below 85. </p>
<p>There are not that many trades where below 85 IQs can make a living. The skilled and unskilled trades have been turned over to hispanics.</p>
<p>Janitor, dishwashing and car washing are the monopoly of hispanics. </p>
<p>Historically, it is the second generation immigrants who became criminals.  Fathe was content to be a dishwasher or janitor for low pay and long hours.  Sons often went into crime.</p>

		<p>We always hear about proud, strong black women.  For generations now they have failed miserably to properly bring up their children.  Instead of being proud and having extremely out-of-whack opinions of themselves, there should be widespread shame in the black community.  I&rsquo;ve seen them called the race of failures.  Indeed.  As far as hispanics, I&rsquo;ll never understand the love affair the neoCONS and CONservatives have with them.  Some CONS want high immigration so these people will pay taxes to help fund the Medicare and Social Security programs.  New stats show almost 30% of them live in poverty.  Throw in the illegals and it goes higher.  How&rsquo;s that working out for the CONS?  </p>

<p>BINGO!  Not being able to read beyond a second or third grade level, no one should be given a GED or diploma, and nor should a person be admitted into any college.  Yet, this occurs.  The extremely widespread cheating by teachers and administrators goes largely unnoticed or unreported and its purposeful.  This is truly one of the most disgusting things I can think of.  </p>
