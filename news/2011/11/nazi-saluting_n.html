			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Craig Mackenzie, Daily Mail (London), November 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thousands of far-right Nazi-saluting nationalists marched in Moscow today in a &#8216;Take Back Russia&rsquo; protest at Muslim migrants.</p>
<p>Resentment is growing over the migrants from Russia&rsquo;s Caucasus and the money the Kremlin sends to those troubled regions.</p>
<p>Chanting &#8216;Russia for Russians&rsquo; and &#8216;Migrants today, occupiers tomorrow,&rsquo; about 5,000 demonstrators, mostly young men, marched through a working-class neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital.</p>
<p>Police stood shoulder-to-shoulder along the street, which was blocked to traffic.</p>
<p>Violently xenophobic groups have flourished in Russia over the past two decades, killing and beating non-Slavs and anti-racism activists, and crudely denouncing the influx of immigrants from the Caucasus and from central Asian countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They have drawn moral support from nationalism that has been encouraged by Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s rule as part of the Kremlin&rsquo;s attempts to rebuild a strong Russian state.</p>
<p>After a clash last December between police and thousands of football fans and other extremists just outside the Kremlin walls, and an unprecedented outbreak of hate crimes, the government has taken a tougher line against the groups.</p>
<p>But their virulent hatred is proving hard to combat for many Russians share the anti-migrant sentiments and even those who would not describe themselves as racist are increasingly resentful of the hefty subsidies sent to the Caucasus, particularly to Chechnya.</p>
<p>The money is intended to bring stability after years of war, but the region remains deeply impoverished while Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov flaunts his wealth.</p>
<p>Among the banners carried today was one reading, &#8216;Stop feeding the Caucasus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;All Russian people are on the march  &mdash;  football fans, skinheads, national socialists,&rsquo; Dmitry Demushkin, who leads a banned group called Russkiye, or Russians, shouted to the crowd: &#8216;We have to show what our nation is demanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The so-called Russian March has been held annually since 2005 on a new national holiday created to replace celebrations of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.</p>
<p>The new holiday was usurped by far-right nationalists, whose first rally in 2005 led to the shocking sight of thousands of skinheads marching through central Moscow with their hands raised in a Nazi salute and shouting obscene racist slogans.</p>
<p>The following year the march was banned, but nationalists marched anyway and clashed violently with police. Since 2007, the Russian March has been relegated to areas outside of the capital&rsquo;s centre</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended a National Unity Day ceremony 400 miles from the capital.</p>
<p>They laid flowers at the monument of Minin and Pozharsky, the leaders of a liberation struggle against foreign invaders in 1612 in the historic city of Nizhny Novgorod.</p>

		<p>The media deliberately underestimated the size of the crowd. Usually, such whittling down the crowd size for Rightist groups is a factor of at least 5 to 1, so the crowd was probably more on the order of 20 to 25,000. </p>

		<p>I always say that Russia is the most xenophobic country on earth  &mdash;  and for good reason.  Look at the invasions the nation has endured for centuries and the struggle that the white Russians have had in maintaining a European civilization in such a vast, partly Asian country.  Russians have had it tough, and they are tough.  <br>
More than likely, the only thing Putin and Medvedev are concerned about is keeping power.  If it&rsquo;s to their benefit to support the &#8220;Nazi-saluting&#8221; throngs, they will probably do so.</p>

		<p>Poster #2 is right about the Western media fudging numbers as usual: 15 000 - 20 000 young men attended. But if Russia cuts off the Caucasus &amp; Central Asia, it will have an impoverished Muslim population turning to pan-Turkism &amp; Islamism. Moscow would be White &amp; Christian but all of Russia&rsquo;s south would be threatened from the Black Sea to China by pro-Saudi regimes that the West is eager to prop up. </p>

		<p>This is why muslims are dangerous</p>
<p>Muslims Burn Christian Alive and Murder His Father over Rumor <br>
A Muslim man set fire to a Coptic young man, murdered his father and wounded his younger brother, after it was rumored that the young Copt allegedly had a relationship with the Muslim man&rsquo;s sister!!</p>
<p>The events took place in the small village of &#8220;Dmas&#8221; Meet-Ghamr, after a rumor spread around of a relationship between the 25-year-old Copt Shihata Sabri, and the sister of a Muslim man named Yasser Ahmed Qasim.</p>
<p>Yasser went to Coptic Shehata, holding a gasoline canister, poured it over him and set him on fire, as bystanders looked on in horror. The young Copt threw himself into the adjacent canal to try to put out the flames from his burning body. The fire left burns all over his body, leading to his death.</p>
<p>Following this incident, people in the village rallied and when the 60-years-old Sabri Shehata, father of the Coptic victim arrived, he was attacked by a group of Muslims stabbing him with knives and daggers; one stab penetrated his back to come out of his abdomen below the rib cage, resulting in his death, after being transferred to hospital.</p>
<p>A Coptic witness said that Yasser Ahmed, who is reputed to be a thug, and others have also beaten the Coptic victim&rsquo;s younger brother, 22-year old Rami Sabri Shehata, causing a deep injury to his head.</p>

		<p>I hope young whites facing a bleak future get a good look at what these young Russian men are doing and follow in their footsteps. I am a Slav myself, and my ancestors have fough too many brutal wars to avoid sugjugation then annihilation under the Muslim yoke. I exhort young white Americans to remember a qoute from a Ukrainian nationalist whom I was named after, a many who was the Ukrainian Patrick Henry. &#8220;Why do you boast, you sons of a destitute Ukraine? That you walk well in a yoke, even better than your fathers did?&#8221; That is the future young Russians see on the horizon and that is why they are marching in the streets. That is why they are taking the fight to the enemy, literally with fists and boots if not knives and guns. This is the present right now for young white Americans, and unless they start doing something about it right now, it will be a lot worse for their sons and daughters, those who are not mongrels because of miscegnation.</p>

I&rsquo;ll bet he is in bed with the Islamists and would receive an award from Morris Dees and Mark Potok of the so-called SPLC, which to me, stands for the Society of Propogation of Leftistism and Communism!!<br>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if your estimate is low-balling.  Last year in Manhattan when Geert Wilders addressed an anti-mosque crowd on 9/11, the Marxist-oriented mainstream media (on both sides of the Atlantic!) reported the anti-mosque crowd (and a &#8220;pro-mosque crowd&#8221; of Moslems and leftist rabble a couple of blocks away) &#8216;each had hundreds of people.&rsquo;  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11274010" rel="nofollow">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11274010</a></p>
<p>The only problem is, I was there.  I saw the size of both crowds.  True enough, the pro-mosque bunch numbered no more than several hundred unwashed losers lining the sidewalks.  The crowed listening to Geert Wilders, however, crammed sidewalks and streets, stretching for several blocks.  A police officer I spoke with told me they estimated the size of the crowd at &#8220;easily over 20,000.&#8221; </p>

<p>If a tree falls in the forest and no one was there to hear it, was a noise made?  The cultural Marxists running the media already know the answer.  Bet on it!</p>
<p>I know several people who have traveled to Russia, and they tell me the number of ethnic Russians there who harbor nationalist and even ultra-nationalist sentiments is staggering!  I wonder if anyone can post any links to blogs that have covered this event so we can get a better idea as to the actual number of participants.  </p>

		<p>I believe the Moslems recently killed a Russian Football fan. This started some retaliatory behavior - I notice that part was left out&hellip; Business as usual. I think there is a lesson to be learned here: If you don&rsquo;t jeopardize the survival of your people, you don&rsquo;t run the risk of the rise of a radical militant group. Somehow I suspect that&rsquo;s all part of the Soros-esque plan.</p>

		<p>Let me add that these Hitler-loving Jew-hating Neo Nazis are not WNs but Pagan Slavic Supremacists who believe that the distribution of haplogroup R1a among Slavs makes them the Ubermenschen Aryans that Hitler wrote about in MK, so they consider Nazism more suited to them than Germans and most see Westerners as Untermenschen to some degree plus they&rsquo;re not happy with their women taken by Western men so you dont want them in power, neither does Putin or the Church. Too extreme even for me!</p>

<p>But, those nations that lost tens of millions of dead from the German Nationalist Socialist invasions of Eastern Europe - yeah, if anybody deserves the right to make a Nazi fascist salute to protest the NW Muslim invasions of your homelands - yes, Russians, Ukrainians, Estonians - give a good salute for all of us.</p>

&ldquo;Thousands of far-right Nazi-saluting nationalists marched in Moscow today in a &lsquo;Take Back Russia&rsquo; protest at Muslim migrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is really hard to believe that affection for the Nazis is widespread in Russia.  </p>
<p>What is shoved in the readers&rsquo; face is the Nazi salute.  It may or may not have happened.  But fixing in the minds of the people the idea that opposing foreigners is a Nazi thing is a goal of the anti-White forces.</p>
<p>The pro-immigration, pro-multiracial crowd becomes apoplectic when the Nazis are glorified, so it is possible the some of the pro-Russian people did intend to irritate the anti-Russian forces with the hated Nazi salute.  But this practice is so obviously counter productive that you must wonder if the pro-immigration forces aren&rsquo;t in fact behind it.<br>

		<p>I dated a pretty blonde Russian girl once.  She told me she flat out did not like blacks people.  I was shocked at how brazen and matter-of-fact she was saying it as most whites today (especially the younger generation) are PC and not very pro-white at all.  I&rsquo;ve met other Russians, even women, who are not very fond of blacks or hispanics either.  </p>

<p>When all these squeamish posters start holding similar marches right here, <i>then</i> they can express themselves in whatever way they see fit.  Until then, I am in full support of the Russian marchers.<br>

I don&rsquo;t like the Nazi salute either-(have these guys ever heard of the Great Patriotic War?) but at least young Russians are doing SOMETHING against the blather which is multiculturism.  Now if only we can get our young people to do the same, or do they have to be bonked on their heads by crinimal-minded blacks first?</p>

<p>That nazi salute was not invented by the nazis. It is the same as the old Roman salute 2,500 years old.  Many countries and organizations have used that type of salute over the centuries.</p>
<p>The swatztika, lightening blots and other symbols approriated by the nazis had all been around for centuries.  The original nazis<br>
long before 1930 studied anthropology, ancient myths of every continent,history and symbolism to come up with their symbols and slogans.</p>

<p>One posts on this board once in a while.  I think he (must have been a he) started that big irrevelant discussion that Persians are not Whites a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Of course had the nazis treated the russians and ukranians as well as they treated the French during the occupation the communists might have been overthrown and western Russia at least<br>
part of a German empire.</p>
<p>Russia is really like America.  A mass of ethnic groups with different languages, religions and cultures who dislike each other.  Their armenians are a thousand times worse than our armenians to cite just one ethnic group.</p>
<p>If you look at Russian history, you will see that even the russian language speaking russian orthodox, ethnic russians<br>
were a mass of conflicting interests that could only be ruled with an iron hand.<br>

		<p>I have a question? Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a little odd for these people to make Nazi Salutes? I mean if you read history, you would see Hitler considered &#8221; white Slavic&#8221; people to be more inferior than blacks and more dangerous to the Third Reich than Jews. The Nazis advocated the death of 30 million Slavs. As a matter of fact Nazi forces did kill off 30 million Slavic people.</p>
<p>20 million Russians, 8 million Poles, and 3 million Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Therefore, these Russian Nazis would be the equivalence of Jewish K members or Black supporters of this organization. </p>

<p>During the cold war the Russians were very active in Africa. In fact, they were behind many of the independence movements especially in Angola, Congo, Zimbabwe, S Africa and most of the others.</p>
<p>They established a revolutionary training university(Patrice Lummamba) in the fifties in Moscow and brought african blacks for training in revolution.</p>
<p>Not even the lowest and most desperate hookers could be persuaded to service the blacks.  So Castro shipped cuban black and mulatto women over to service the blacks.  Patrice Lummbaba university students were tightly controlled by the russian police.  No rapes beat downs or robberies.</p>
<p>There are lots of russians in my city.  Like most White immigrants they detest blacks.</p>

<p>I presume those calculated victim numbers you claim are directly taken from eastern European communist propaganda books of the 50&rsquo;s. The death toll of the Russian and Polish population was unmistakably very high but nowhere near the size you assert.  Eastern European  &#8220;historians&#8221; had a vital interest in inflating their casualties both military and civilian.Given the population surge Poland experienced after the WWII 8 million dead Poles at the hands of Nazi Germany are outrightly ridiculous. At the same time the death toll of the Dresden firebombing has been lowered to absurdly low numbers despite very little water proof evidence.<br>
Remember it&rsquo;s the victor that writes the history books. Needless<br>
to say that these &#8220;Nazi&#8221; salutes are bordering on the lines of utter stupidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as they don&rsquo;t go all antisemitic more power to them. Sounds like a good example to emulate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russians have driven out almost all of their Jews by now. That said, anti-Semitism was a big part of Russian nationalism from since Black Hundreds were founded more than century ago. Back then, they killed loads of Jews (during civil war whites were especially bad), and during Soviet Union, most of the rest were driven into Israel. So, they won&rsquo;t go all anti-Semitic. No point anymore.</p>
<p>Russia isn&rsquo;t exactly Western. Culturally and genetically, the nation balances between Europe and Asia. It has had, it has, and it will always have a really hard time doing so.</p>

		<p>There were plenty of local auxiliaries helping the Germans out on their march eastwards. These got the less glamorous jobs, like rounding up jews, which they did with great gusto. This is something you dont learn in holocaust class where its German this and German that. </p>
<p>As for why, during the half century leading up to world war II, being a jew in Europe was synonymous with being a communist. The news about the great kulak mass murders and other communist shenanigans in the nascent Soviet Union were transported wide by the jungle telegraph, and once the Germans came all those that lost relatives to the communist commissars came out out of the woods to get their pound of flesh. If they could not get one of those, any jew would do just as well, since they were very likely to be the relative of some communist apparatnik. The holocaust was thus not some random event that just happened because jews were a convenient scapegoat or some other excuse like that, it was a part of a much larger piece of history, a piece which is not exhibited or even mentioned at your local holocaust museum. </p>
<p>Regarding the nazi anti slav stance, that seems to have been pretty limited in practice. One million slavs fought under General Vaslov against the allied forces. These did not only fight on the eastern front, they were were also deployed in the west against advancing western allied forces. The americans/brits did not understand the nature of those that they were fighting, and clueless promises of repatriation in exchange for surrender caused slavic units to fight to the last man on at least one occasion. It was better to fall in combat than to be sent back to Stalins death camps (which did happen to the survivors). </p>
<p>Today there are more nazis in Russia than there are in Western Europe. The russian prowhite movement is totally unlike the one in America. Jared Taylor versus a band of head stomping nazi skins? On the street, the latter meets much greater success. Thats one of the first places where it counts. Just ask any white american who have had to practice white flight. </p>

<p>&#8220;That nazi salute was not invented by the nazis. It is the same as the old Roman salute 2,500 years old. Many countries and organizations have used that type of salute over the centuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no record, either in statuary, paintings or literature, of the ancient Romans ever having used that salute.  In fact, the first time that salute was mentioned being associated with the Romans was in a painting by the late-18th century artist Jacques-Louis David entitled &#8220;The Oath of the Horatii&#8221; (1784).  </p>
<p>The first time the so-called &#8220;Roman salute&#8221; was used for political purposes (in recorded history) was by the followers of the Italian poet and military adventurer Gabriele D&rsquo;Annunzio when he seized the city of Fiume at the end of WW1.  D&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s love of neo-imperial rituals was said to have inspired future dictator Benito Mussolini, who, of course, later inspired Adolf Hitler.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, the people they hate have something they want or need.  This is why, by the way, the Nazis secretly signed a treaty with the Soviets (whom they hated) to carve up Poland between them.  Hitler tried on several occasions to form an alliance with Poland against the Soviet Union.  Each time he was rebuffed by Polish Chief of State Marshal Jòzef Pilsudski, who correctly guessed Hitler was a man who could not be trusted (something Mussolini learned way too late).  This mistrust was validated when Hitler later abrogated the Munich Pact and gobbled up Czechoslovakia, contrary to earlier assurances.</p>

		<p>Periapsis- I am also part Slav, part Celt, part German. All White American. I am familiar with the desire of the Slavs to keep their homelands racially, ethnically, culturally as uniform as possible. My father has been to Slovakia three times since 2001. He claims that there are alot of gypsies and there is a quiet majority of White Slavs who are fed up with the garbage, the crime and the lawlessness brought from the third world. The problem is that, like in America, these negative tendencies seem to draw the society down to its level. Whites see that no one is doing anything about the cleanliness and there is no repercussions, so they start doing it. It&rsquo;s the easy thing to do. The culture of incompetence must change or White social values will erode. And if/when they do, the non-whites are not long for this world. Maybe strength in numbers, but quality of life, well&hellip; Not so much. And without quality of life there are no safety and health standards, no environmental standards, no regulation on food and drink, economy crumbles, no value in housing, no clean water, more impoverished and neglected youth breed more of the same types, etc&hellip; The world as we know it will cease to exist. </p>

What kept it limited was the cooler heads of the Wehrmacht generals, who knew it would be disastrous to alienate those in their operating area. They also knew that the Russians could provide invaluable manpower to the war effort. Cossacks were especially prized by the German commanders: many would end up loyally following their commanders all the way back to Austria by the end of the war. </p>

<p>****************************************************************</p>
<p>Right&hellip;Everybody in the Balkans are always evil Nazis except the Serbs who are always angelic victims.  Gee, how come this narrative sounds so familiar ?</p>
<p>First of all, both Croatia (Ante Pavelic) and Serbia (Milan Nedic) had pro-Axis governments during WW2.  Second, the only true resistance to the Axis in Yugoslavia during WW2 were the Partisans which were founded and led not by a Serb, but by a Croat: JOSIP BROZ TITO.  Third, the Nazis also recruited Orthodox Slavs like the Serbian State Guard, the Serbian Chetniks (ie: Kosta Pecanac) and Serbian fascists (ie: Dimitrije Ljotic) to track and kill not just Catholic and Orthodox Partisans, but also Gypsies and Jews. Not only was Belgrade declared the first &#8220;Judenfrei&#8221; city in Europe in 1942, but the leader of the supposedly resisting Chetniks (Draza Mihailovic) was actually executed for high treason and war crimes in 1946 !<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/9DFkr" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/9DFkr</a></p>
<p>As for those poor Othodox Slavs being killed in the 1990&rsquo;s, this is quite a fascinating perspective considering that they commited the worst massacre in Europe since WW2 by slaughtering more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim civilians in Srebenica: <a href="https://goo.gl/SB1ST" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/SB1ST</a></p>
<p>Enough of the hypocrisy already.  All the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia were about territorial sovereignty, not religion.  It all started in 1918 when the Allies at the Treaty of Versailles forced everybody to live together, so that the Serbian minorities in Bosnia and Croatia could all live in the same state.  They wanted to avoid another Sarajevo assasination that started WW1, but it was A BIG MISTAKE.  Within 10 years, unelected Serbian king Alexander I had abolished the Constitution and established a royal dictatorship. That&rsquo;s why some of the Croats and Bosnian Muslims who weren&rsquo;t with the Partisans slaughtered Serbian civilians in retaliation during WW2.  The conflict in the 1990&rsquo;s was also all about local revenge which logically ended with the Serbs losing the war in both Croatia and the Bosnian territories where they didn&rsquo;t belong.  See, Kosovo would still be part of Serbia if the Serbs had focused on their own territory in the first place, and they only have themselves to blame for their greed.  Just like all these minorities who are invading Europe and the US, forced multiculturalism is bound to fail like in Yugoslavia.  The ancestral and rightful owners of the land will always prevail when pushed to the wall.  Let this be a lesson to those here who keep crying about their diasporas instead of preserving the integrity of THEIR OWN BORDERS .<br>

Well the misunderstanding is that Nazism was some kind of monolithic block   &mdash;   you probably also know that Himmler had these occult and pagan ideas   &mdash;   and today the Third Reich is often portrayed in the media as some occult state <br>
BUT when you look at the numbers of those pagan movements in the Reich   &mdash;   LESS than ONE PERCENT belonged to those groups (how many occultists are there today in the USA? More or less?). For example the German Christians Movement was much stronger (I once read an interesting article which mentioned the number churches built in Berlin alone in the 1930s   &mdash;   and those destroyed <br>
by the communists after the war). <br>
So back to that perspective regarding races &hellip;<br>

Hitler&rsquo;s propaganda minister Goebbels had a Czech mistress   &mdash;   Lida Baarova.<br>
The so called crown jurist of the Reich   &mdash;   Carl Schmitt   &mdash;   was married to a Serbian woman.</p>
<p>Look at the big picture and also consider the &#8220;blood declaration of faith&#8221; (of the proto-Nazi &#8220;Thule society&#8221;) and ALSO consider what American eugenicists said about these racial questions.</p>

		<p>   I don&rsquo;t care if they salute by standing on their heads and spitting nickels,  These are young white people who have the guts to stand up and fight for what they believe in.  Unlike American youths who accept all this multiculturalism garbage and think they are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>   Perhaps the only hope for the White Race is Russia.   (If i was 16 I would emigrate there )  </p>
