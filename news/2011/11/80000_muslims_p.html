			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Boston Globe, November 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tens of thousands of Muslim men knelt shoulder-to-shoulder in prayer on the freezing streets of Moscow on Sunday to celebrate the religious holiday of Eid al-Adha.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number of Muslims living or working in the Russian capital run from 2 million to as high as 5 million, but the city only has a few mosques.</p>
<p>Police said 170,000 people celebrated the holiday in Moscow, including 80,000 who gathered on the street outside what was once the main mosque. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police cordoned off the area and set up metal detectors to screen worshippers. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s Council of Muftis said that for the first time this year the ritual slaughter of sheep was performed at 10 slaughterhouses on the outskirts of Moscow. In past years, Muscovites have complained angrily about the killing of sheep in the courtyards of apartment buildings in the city center.</p>

Perhaps we could take a lesson from him.</p>

<p>In France, as in Algeria, North-African Muslims sometimes do that in the bathtub of their flat. Within 20 years, it will certainly happen in the nearby parking lot.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the price Russia must pay to keep pan-Turkic Islamism from taking over the Caucasus and especially C.Asia where the Russian minority enjoys priveleged status and the fact that Moscow has one mosque shows the low status of Muslims there.</p>

		<p>Lets make ourselves as obnoxious and obtrusive as possible. Lets block a public street and deny others the use of it! A clearly intended &#8220;in your face&#8221; gesture by muslims.</p>

		<p>If the muslims got a permit for a one day event I see no problem with it other than the fact that there are so many muslims in Moscow.  </p>
<p>Russia has been imperialist for a thousand years.  Russia could not expand west to Europe so it expanded east to muslim territory.  Russia wanted muslim territory and muslim peoples.  Russia has them.</p>

		<p>In fact, most of the Muslims in Russia are not immigrants but quite indigenous to the soil. Those countries were conquered by Russians during the great expansion and became satellite republics of Moscow. Actually it wouldn&rsquo;t be very wrong to say that Russia is not necessarily a fully white and Slavic country with huge numbers of minorities (not immigrants).</p>
<p>Those who were not from Russian federation are mostly from Central Asian Turkic republics that are still de facto governed by Russia and Russian minorities living there. </p>
<p>While Turkic Muslims are not very religious and meanwhile partially assimilated into Slavic culture (both racially and culturally), those from the Caucasus have become very radical due to the Russian atrocities and war crimes during the Chechen war. </p>
<p>Yes, from a White Nationalist point of view, it might be sad to see these scenes in the center of Eastern Christianity but let&rsquo;s be honest, Russia is not that innocent and must learn to live with Muslims. Another solution would be giving full independence to these folks and deport them from the Russian proper but it seems they have no intention to do this&hellip;</p>

		<p>The territory that Russia conquered in Central Asia is land that was once populated by whites.  Mongol expansion changed the racial demographics, like Spain conquering the new world. Whites lived well into what is today China at the time of Christ.  </p>

<p>Pray tell, exactly what did our grandfathers &#8220;win&#8221;? Can you honestly keep repeating that lie that we fought the &#8220;good war&#8221;?  We LOST in every way imaginable. LOOK at America and all of the Western White world NOW. Do you like what you see? This is the legacy that we reaped.  </p>
<p>As many posters here stated, please read up on that nazi salute sometime. I&rsquo;ll take that any day over the &#8220;high fives&#8221; that I see Whitey mimicking.</p>
