			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claire Bates, Daily Mail (London), November 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ever wished you were the blue-eyed boy? You soon could be, after a doctor revealed he can permanently change a person&rsquo;s eye colour in just 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Dr Gregg Homer, from Stroma Medical in California said his Lumineyes technology uses a laser tuned to a specific frequency to turn brown eyes to blue.</p>
<p>The laser energy removes the brown pigment, or melanin, from the top layer of the iris, and the blue eye colour emerges over the following two to three weeks.</p>
<p>It would provide an alternative to those who wanted lighter eyes without resorting to cosmetic contact lenses.</p>
<p>However the procedure  &mdash;  which Dr Homer has developed over 10 years  &mdash;  is irreversible because the brown tissue cannot regenerate.</p>
<p>Stroma Medical has started limited human testing but is seeking up to £500,000 to complete clinical trials.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan Dr Homer says the procedure could be available outside the U.S within 18 months and inside the U.S in three years.</p>
<p>The former entertainment lawyer said the operation would cost around £3,000.</p>
<p>Dr Homer told KTLA Morning News that thousands of prospective clients had contacted him by email to express their interest.</p>
<p>&#8216;They say the eyes are the windows to the soul,&rsquo; he told ktla.com.</p>
<p>&#8216;A blue eye is not opaque, you can see deeply into it, while a brown eye is very opaque. I think there is something very meaningful about this idea of having open windows to the soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>CEO of Stroma Medical, Doug Daniels, admitted he wasn&rsquo;t sure about the concept when Dr Homer first told him about it.</p>
<p>&#8216;I was very sceptical frankly, but I learned a long time ago that all the great ideas start out as blasphemy,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Eye colour is inherited, however brown eyes are dominant across the world while blue eyes are a recessive trait.</p>
<p>A blue eye pigment doesn&rsquo;t actually exist in nature. Instead, people with blue eyes have a brown pigment, known as melamin, at the back of their irises but have low concentrations of melanin in the front of their irises.</p>
<p>This means longer wavelengths of light are absorbed by the dark back of the eye, while the shorter wavelengths are scattered.</p>
<p>In 2008, scientists from the University of Copenhagen, found that all people with blue eyes were descended from a single ancestor with a blue eye mutation who lived six to 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Study leader Professor Eiberg said before this time, everyone had brown eyes.</p>
<p>The mutation of brown eyes to blue represents neither a positive nor a negative mutation. It is one of several mutations such as hair colour, baldness, freckles and beauty spots, which neither increases nor reduces a human&rsquo;s chance of survival.</p>
<p>Professor Eiberg said at the time: &#8216;It simply shows that nature is constantly shuffling the human genome, creating a genetic cocktail of human chromosomes and trying out different changes as it does so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yeah, and isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the sudden appearance of both Adam (in standard Biblical anthropology ) and Caucasoid Humanity, appeared out of nowhere (in Adam&rsquo;s case, ex nihilo!) at about the same time? -roughly 6-10,000 years ago, give or take a thousand&hellip;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted before, the Biblical writers have also said that Jesus&rsquo; eyes are like a flame of fire- yet, at the heart of the fire, where it is hottest, the fire is BLUE.</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/4L6GO</p>
<p>But then, as I&rsquo;ve noted in prior columns (and even given the references) that is as it should be, as Jesus is the &#8216;Last ADAM&rsquo; and the Hebrew word Adam, means &#8216;fair, ruddy, able to [visibly] blush - a characteristic notable only of Caucasoids, where the blue-eyed gene also comes from&hellip;. Hmmmm. Coincidence? I don&rsquo;t think so&hellip;.</p>
<p>So now we just have yet another falsehood, for people who are aping wanting to be white. Just as with hair straighteners, cosmetics for the &#8216;African-American woman,&rsquo; teeth bleaching, face whiteners, and (for those who can afford it) removal of epicanthic folds, flat noses, hook noses, and cosmetic surgery a la Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>You know - if we&rsquo;re so hateful and racist being white, Why is it everyone wants to BE us? Genesis 3:15, and ENVY.</p>

		<p>Ugh!  If that picture is reflective of the change, keep the brown eyes.  The &#8220;blue&#8221; part looks gray/black/white and is not attractive at all.  If anyone takes him up on this, we&rsquo;ll start seeing the freaks real soon.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a geneticist so maybe someone on here can answer my question. If a laser can turn a person&rsquo;s brown eyes blue will this cause the mutation that causes this recessive eye color? I&rsquo;m wondering this because if this sort of thing would cause the mutation to occur, then people could pass their newly aquired blue eyes on to their decendants. Otherwise not. </p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t increase or decrease chances of survival? Are you kidding? What about the underground comic charcter with the pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes who was dubbed &#8220;Ultraviolet Collector Girl? Okay, I admit it. I made it up. But you get the point.</p>
<p>How is it that natural selection is supposed to affect every other entity on earth, but not human beings?</p>

		<p>This will no doubt be deemed as &#8216;progress&rsquo; in some way, although the benefits of this procedure on face value are only cosmetic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken me a while to realize that &#8216;progress&rsquo; is actually a euphemism for destruction, such as when people comment on a strip mall being built in a beautiful natural vista or when railway lines are laid down to ruin a beautiful valley, where the standard response will often be &#8220;that&rsquo;s progress for you&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is why I find myself every becoming the regressionist.</p>
<p>&#8216;Progress&rsquo; makes everything feel like nothing and that everything that can happen, inevitably will happen.</p>
<p>Having moral, ethical or cultural objections are really futile in the border less, globalists world.</p>
<p>Nationalistic objections can only really temporarily slow the corrosive effect of progressivism in your region, as the perpetual pressure from the liberal supremacist ethos, when accompanied with the loss of community cohesion that comes from having a ever increasing multi-cultural (i.e. multi-moral) population is just too relentless.</p>
<p>Regarding the subject of this article, it makes me very sad that one day obtaining our unique and distinctive northern European characteristics will be cheaply marketed along side getting your ears pierced etc.  </p>
<p>Ignoring people with pigmentation disorders or contact lenses, currently all blued eyed peoples share a common ancestor.<br>
 <br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/nvdB" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/nvdB</a></p>
<p>Thanks to this scientific development, this will soon no longer be the case.<br>
I use the fact that my children have blue eyes to subtly promote to them their own racial uniqueness and awareness, it&rsquo;ll soon be &#8216;back to drawing board&rsquo; for me on that strategy shortly.</p>
<p>Something that can be easily bought, is no longer &#8216;special&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I am offended, but unfortunately I belong to the one cultural group who are apparently impossible to offend.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder who exactly owns the rights to our genetic characteristics?<br>
The following video made me appreciate that it&rsquo;s not us, the individuals.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Man With The Golden Cells&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0o_a4OgOWM" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0o_a4OgOWM</a></p>
<p>(Read the video blurb for a description).</p>
<p>If &#8220;the eyes are the windows of the soul&#8221;, does that mean that having &#8216;fake eyes&rsquo; means that you also have a &#8216;fake soul&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Or is it just all window dressing and our physical characteristics really just the equivalent of masks or costumes as the progressives would have us believe as to cover our spirits/souls (which nullifies the power of hereditary).</p>
<p>The entrepreneurial spirit behind this certainly feels soulless.</p>
<p>The one benefit I suppose is, it may decrease demand in breeding with genuine Whites, when our features become less exotic.   </p>

<p>Short answer: No. </p>
<p>Slightly longer answer: That would violate everything we know about the way genetics and evolution work. There&rsquo;s no inheritance of acquired characteristics. </p>

		<p>So blue eyes will still be available for a price even if the anti-Whites&rsquo; program of White Genocide is successful. Probably injections that turn brown skin into milky white skin will become available too. Once Whites have been removed by anti-Whites from the face of the earth, the anti-Whites can repopulate the earth with &#8220;white&#8221; Michael Jacksons to celebrate the victory of White Genocide.</p>
<p>(In regard to Michael Jackson I heard a local Hispanic radio host say, &#8220;What a wonderful country the United States is&hellip;where else can a black man turn himself into a white woman?&#8221; Eventually if won&rsquo;t be a joke but will be a commonplace)</p>
<p>Anti-Whites are flooding every White country with non-Whites. That will result in the genocide of Whites as surely as the Spanish pouring into Mexico extinguished that land&rsquo;s native peoples and replaced them with the interbred Mestizo race that populates Mexico today.</p>

Anon, This surgery at any time after birth will not affect the genetic material passed on to the next generation. An example of this would be someone who loses one hand in an accident. None of that person&rsquo;s future children would be born without one hand because of the parent&rsquo;s accident&hellip;<br>
I wonder how this surgery would affect the eyesight of the person who has their eyes surgically lightened from brown to blue. Do people of non-white heritage want to look like us enough to risk impaired sight and/or blindness? </p>

		<p>I had bright blue eyes until about age three.  My mother was thrilled.  Then my eyes started to change.  I now have greenish eyes with a golden ring around each pupil. Earlier this year I found out what kind of eyes I have: sectoral heterochromia, essentially tu-tone eyes!  Pretty neat.  Another example of white diversity!</p>

<p>My first reaction to that was that the two situations were different, since the indigenous in Mexico were very demoralized by their military defeats by the Spanish, and felt themselves overwhelmed by a new God that was stronger than their own deities.</p>
<p>But then I realized that isn&rsquo;t so different from the situation of Whites today, whose former mode of worship has been replaced by the MultiCult, and who are demoralized by the various successful attacks on them even if they are also often hypnotized beyond realizing it.</p>

		<p>Blue eyes have no use, though they expanded&hellip;<br>
Two main possible explanations : <br>
1° Sexual selection : blue-eyed persons were found attractive, and had more offsprings. For instance, blue-eyed girls often married leaders or high status males, and the leaders&rsquo; children had more opportunities to survive. Or blue-eyed men often became leaders&hellip; Or blue-eyed men had more opportunities to commit adultery&hellip; <br>
2° On the genome, the character is related to a character which is useful for survival. For instance, having blue eyes may depend from a character that often gives fair skin too, and fair skin is useful when you live far North. So it is not blue eyes which is selected, but the other character.<br>
3° The two explanations are not exclusive.<br>
4° One can imagine other explanations. For instance, the blue-eye character being recessive : after an adultery between a blue-eyed man and a brown-eyed woman married to a brown-eyed man, the offspring often does not have blue eyes, so the adultery is not discovered, so the woman and the child are not killed. On the opposite, in a couple of blue-eyed persons, when the woman commits adultery with a brown-eyed man, the child is often brown-eyed, so the adultery is suspected, and the woman and child often killed.   </p>

<p>&#8220;I know a lot of latinas, and they are way-o fascinated by diverse hair and eye colors found in white people. If I had a dollar for every time a latina wanted to examine my greenish-yellow eyes or complimented me on my hair color&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is true.  I was only in Mexico once, in the 1980s, but I was in a remote region.  One day, I was on a walk and stopped in at a little cafe.  One woman who was with a man who seemed her husband, left him, came over with her drink, offered me some, and sat down all the while starring into my eyes.  She kept doing it while talking softly in Spanish.  Her husband didn&rsquo;t get mad or anything like that, although I expected it.  She finally stopped.  There was nothing implied, nor did she try to touch me or anything like that.  She just wanted to check out my very blue peepers for a while, like some exhibit in a zoo.  I remember seeing photos in the 60s in a National Geographic of remotely living African children touching a white boy&rsquo;s blond hair in wonder.  I also read about Chinese women doing the same when Westerners first began arriving in communist China after decades of absence.  </p>

		<p>This is&hellip;insane. And potentially dangerous. Are people so mad that they would risk their eyesight for blue eyes? Personally, I never find fake eye or hair color attractive. There is usually something odd about it. </p>

<p>Right, and so are Albinos while you&rsquo;re at it: <a href="https://goo.gl/ykYtg" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/ykYtg</a></p>
<p>Once again another unscientific and unsourced hogwash about light hair and blue eyes being  better or Whiter.  Sorry but there are absolutely no physiological advantages to having blue eyes, quite the contrary.  I have them myself like my mother, and we are both much more sensitive to natural and artificial lights than my brown eyed father and sisters: <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/lightsensitive.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/lightsensitive.htm</a></p>
<p>That is a &#8220;fact&#8221; that is well known among White families like mine (French Norman and Belgian) that have different hair and eye colors, and nobody would ever think that they are the &#8220;the latest and best model&#8221;.  The same goes with having fair skin like all of us which has increased the risk for developing skin cancer to epidemic proportions in the last 50 years: <a href="https://goo.gl/HcM3a" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/HcM3a</a></p>
<p>It is my brain and European heritage that make me White, not my light hair and blue eyes. The latter is actually how a low IQ minority would define a White person by the way&hellip;As usual, some people here really need to get over their regional traits and start focusing on the bigger picture.  </p>

<p>Your understanding of mutations doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any better than a layman&rsquo;s. Unlike intelligence, there is nothing about blue eyes that make it &#8216;best&rsquo; compared to brown ones. Blue eyes are more sensitive to UV and can flourish only in northern latitudes. If anything, their range is restricted. So how can they be considered &#8216;best&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Mutations that cause pale skin and eyes in Africans (such as albinism) cause serious side effects such as skin cancer and are routinely selected against. If anything, brown eyes are the candidate for the &#8216;best&rsquo; label.<br>

<p>Quite the contrary. In Europe, men are more likely to have blue eyes than the women, reflecting their hunter-gatherer role in ancient societies. In the foggy north, blue eyes are more transparent and improve your sight, cf. Siberian wolves who are famous for their china-blue eyes&hellip;<br>

<p>This is also incorrect. Skin cancer rates have increased because of the madness for tanned skin of the North European people who migrate to the south and/or spend too much time in tanning studios. It has very little to do with fair skin and was virtually absent in the past. Note the Japanese have very fair skin too and cancer rates are quite very low there (but increasing due to same reasons).</p>
<p>Blacks and veiled Muslim women in Europe develop bone diseases due to their dark skins and insufficient absorbed sunshine.</p>

		<p>Life is simple- everybody would like to be White, if they already aren&rsquo;t. Just like every woman would like to be pretty &amp; of long lasting youthful appearance (plus diamonds), every man tall, non-bald &amp; well endowed (plus character), every low IQer high IQer, every obese person slim- even lanky, every sick person healthy &hellip;</p>
<p>Being White is one step towards ideal human matrix. </p>

		<p>expressed traits are supposed to be an indicator of genetic suitability. now all this cosmetic surgery is complicating things. this reminds me of the case of the man who sued his wife, for misrepresenting her genes. she had gotten plastic surgery before they met, and when they had ugly kids he sued and divorced her. I don&rsquo;t blame him.<br>
I have blue eyes, with a small circle of golden-brown around my pupils. my dad has blue eyes, my mom has brown eyes, my son has my eyes, his dad has the same blue with light brown circling the pupil. also, my son and I have a rare mutation that causes us to have two opposite-direction hair whorls.</p>

<p>You are forgetting that is all evolution based upon environmental differentials. Blue eyes selected well in (very) northern parts of the world where sun light is less unlike southern regions of the world where brown eyes are favored for protection. One role for melanin in eyes serves as protection but protection is not always a great trait. </p>
<p>Melanin in skin protects us from heat/UV light. Lighter skin in northern regions of world are beneficial due the increase ability absorb the Vit D where the sun is out less (unlike darker skinned people whose may not get as much nutrients from the sun due to lack of sun exposure in northern climates). There is obviously plasticity  as skin can slightly &#8220;adapt (we call this a &#8220;tan&#8221; or getting &#8220;paler&#8221;).&#8221;</p>
<p>The closer you get to the equator the higher the sun is at Zenith. The higher the sun is the more heat there is, etc. This is known as the Crocodile principle. As it was noted that crocodiles would sit out when the soon was highest in the sky. </p>

<p>Tans from tanning salons are not the same as tanning from natural sun exposure. Also you forget the fact that sunscreen does mitigate skin cancer risk as well (although I will agree that by being in a misplaced environment you will always have some lvl of risk), not to mention wrinkles, etc.</p>
<p>And from a personal experience I can always tell when someone gets a tan from a salon as they look &#8220;orange.&#8221;</p>
