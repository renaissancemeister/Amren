			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Government has finally answered the call to protect vulnerable children in danger of sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>It will, this week, publish a National Action Plan designed to make the issue a &#8216;top priority&rsquo; for every local authority.</p>
<p>The news comes amid a devastating report into the failures of police and care agencies to protect teenage girls who have been groomed, raped and sold by male gangs, most of whom are Asian.</p>
<p>The mother of one teenager from Leeds, who attempted suicide after a gang rape, said her daughter was the victim of a &#8216;broken system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Everyone failed her,&rsquo; she told The Times. &#8216;There was no sharing of information. </p>
<p>&#8216;They (police) had the names and knew where they (abusers) worked yet the men who did this have never once been arrested or spoken to by the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>West Yorkshire Police vowed to look again at the case to see if &#8216;there is evidence that can help bring evil men to book&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s charity Barnardos has been calling on the Government to take action on child exploitation since January with its Cut Them Free campaign.</p>
<p>Other caregivers have also suggested that political sensitivities are to blame for a near paralysis of the systems designed to keep children safe.</p>
<p>There is a culture &#8216;which assumes that once a girl gets to 14 she&rsquo;s beyond hope of intervention  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s too late,&rsquo; a source told The Times.</p>
<p>Police and care agencies often say that they cannot take action against suspects without the victim&rsquo;s co-operation. </p>
<p>However, a 2008 protocol established by the force and West Yorkshire&rsquo;s five local authorities states: &#8216;Adults involved in child sexual exploitation &hellip;  should be treated as child sex abusers and subjected to the full rigour of the criminal law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s minister, Tim Loughton, suggested two weeks ago that the plan will call on councils to act with a &#8216;much greater urgency&rsquo; to identify victims of sexual exploitation while taking &#8216;robust action against those who commit these appalling crimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As well as the gang rape case of the girl in Leeds, five new cases have been highlighted by The Times&rsquo; investigation.</p>
<p>No one has been prosecuted for sex exploitation in any of them. Only one of the girls in the six cases had been in care. </p>
<p>One was groomed by white students, but in all the other cases, the perpetrators were Asian, mostly of Pakistani origin.</p>
<p>This pattern of abuse at the hands of male Asian gangs in the West Yorkshire area has been highlighted before, but never formally acknowledged.  </p>
<p>In January the Asian ringleaders of a gang in Derby, who brought a &#8216;reign of terror&rsquo; to a city&rsquo;s streets, targeting and grooming young girls for horrific sexual abuse, were jailed.</p>
<p>Abid Saddique and Mohammed Liaqat were told they would serve a minimum of 11 years and eight years respectively before they could be considered for release.</p>
<p>A DfE spokesman refused to reveal the contents of the National Action Plan but said: &#8216;We are publishing an action plan this week and that will draw on work around the country to prevent sexual exploitation, identify those at risk and support victims.</p>
<p>&#8216;It will address the challenge of securing prosecutions and the need for robust action against perpetrators.</p>
<p>&#8216;Child sexual exploitation is an appalling form of child abuse and we are determined to do everything possible to stamp it out.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s needed when it comes down to a crackdown are the male relatives siezing these rapists and hanging them in public from lamp posts and trees. Death by hanging used to be punished by hanging in England, and it&rsquo;s time to bring it back for these Muslim rape gangs who target minors as well as adult native born British women.</p>

<p>Even the DAILY MAIL uses deliberately misleading terms here; &#8216;Asian&rsquo; in this context means Pakistani / Bangladeshi / Kurdish / Turkish Cypriot not Korean or Cambodian.</p>
<p>This is an issue which the MSM, Home Office and police have tried to sweep under the carpet for years; even the dumbest British piggie or town hall bureaucrat knows that the merest whisper of the dreaded word &#8216;racism&rsquo; is career death.</p>
<p>&#8216;Asian&rsquo; police officers cannot be trusted with these cases; witnesses are intimidated and files are mysteriously &#8216;lost&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The populations of ALL the White countries have been very carefully groomed by the anti-Whites for WHITE GENOCIDE.</p>
<p>Nothing grooms like a good beating, and Whites have been bludgeoned senseless by the r-word in all its different manifestations and applications!</p>
<p>And there is no &#8220;National Action Plan&#8221; in any of those countries to stop the White Genocide that is presently being carried out by the anti-Whites. </p>
<p>No one is demanding that Japan open its borders and admit floods of non-Japanese who will blend the Japanese out of existence.</p>
<p>No one is demanding that China open its borders and admit floods of non-Chinese who will blend the Chinese out of existence.</p>
<p>But EVERY White country and ONLY White countries are being flooded by non-Whites who will blend Whites out of existence, and if I object to this I&rsquo;m a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.</p>
<p>The people carrying out this White Genocide say they are anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White.</p>

		<p>This is appalling, but another problem is that the Chinese or Japanese hasn&rsquo;t gone around the world invading other people&rsquo;s cultures and starting wars. This is what makes White&rsquo;s vulnerable. If they had just &#8220;minded their own business&#8221; then there wouldn&rsquo;t be this invasion of White socities or White guilt. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. Leave other cultures alone and let it be. There&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t much that can be done about it now.</p>

<p>They aren&rsquo;t censoring anything.  In the UK, &#8220;Asian&#8221; means Indian and Pakistani.  This is an article from a UK newspaper, do you expect them to use US terminology?  </p>
<p>And for the hundredth time, &#8220;Asian&#8221; does NOT refer to Arabs in the UK.</p>

The Japanese haven&rsquo;t gone around the world invading other people&rsquo;s cultures?  Why don&rsquo;t you ask the Chinese and Koreans, for starters, about that one!!  And you think they wouldn&rsquo;t have invaded the U.S. mainland during WWII if they had gotten the chance?  <br>
Whatever countries and cultures have done, people today cannot answer for yesterday&rsquo;s sins.  If they did, we&rsquo;d be holding Italians responsible for their ancient Roman ancestors, Arabs for invasions into Europe centuries ago, and so on.  </p>

<p>Sir, what you&rsquo;re doing is misleading indeed:</p>
<p>Kurdish and Turkish Cypriot are not actually &#8220;Asians&#8221;, they are in the &#8220;white other&#8221; category in Britain. They are not Mongoloid or Caucasian-Dravidian South Asians although they are from Asia Minor. </p>
<p>And India Subcontinent is in Asia, whether you regard them as &#8220;Asian&#8221; or not. It&rsquo;s not misleading, have just another meaning in Britain. <br>

<p>Right. Japan actually rampaged all over East Asia and Pacific, starting at the end of 19th century and reaching its climax during WW2. Google &#8220;Nanking Massacre&#8221; and &#8220;Unit 731&#8221; to find out just how nice people they were back then. They haven&rsquo;t got any racial guilt, though, nor is their nation invaded by aliens, unlike plenty of European nations which never took part in imperialism (Scandinavian ones for example).</p>

<p>Really have you ever heard of WWII where the Japanese invaded almost every country in Asia.  Ever heard of the Rape of Nanking or the Bataan Death March during which more Filipinos died than Americans?</p>
<p>China has invaded Vietnam and Korea many times over the past few hundred years.  More recently they invaded and occupied Tibet and Manchuria and are practicing ethnic cleansing and racial replacement using Han Chinese colonist.  </p>

		<p><b>ASIAN</b> is the term used in Britain akin to our &#8216;South Asian&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Anglo-Saxon peoples are so sick that they will not stand up to this, then we deserve our fate..</p>
<p>I can imagine a coalition of libertarians (who are the stealth left) and leftists arguing that this isn&rsquo;t a crime, if we just legalized prostitution (whose business is it anyway, right?) and lowered the age of consent.</p>
<p>Lastly mistreatment and exploitation of white women goes back hundreds if not thousands of years – the Barbary pirates conducted raids on the English coast and as far as Iceland for fair white women for harems – this is not a Victorian fantasy as Marxists claim – the numbers were as high as 3 million – and the moors required blood taxes of Christian women in Spain (the Jewish golden age right?) and of course the Ottomans.</p>

		<p>Technically the Chinese haven&rsquo;t gone around the world to invade foreign countries, most of their military adventures have been local.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken at point one Vietnam was part of China, but that was nearly 1000 years ago.  China never invaded Japan, although the Mongols did.   </p>
<p>Most Chinese conflicts in Asia have been a local phenomenon unlike Europe which went out of its way to invade far flung India and Africa.  The vast majority of China&rsquo;s wars have been at it&rsquo;s borders.   On the other hand European powers insisted at gunpoint that China and Japan open her doors to international trade at gunpoint even though China and Japan were literally thousands of miles away.   </p>
<p>Another example would be Dutch colonization of Indonesia or Spanish and American conquest of the Philippines, there areas were far away from the European heartland.   There was no absolutely no strategic reason to control these far flung areas, their control did not provide any additional security.</p>

		<p>To clear it up. &#8220;Asian&#8221; is kept deliberately vague, but it is recognised by all concerned to mean &#8220;Muslim especially Pakistani-origin&#8221;.<br>
The police have to say that sexual grooming occurs across all communities, which is unfortunately almost correct, but some of the worst cases are what even our chief anti-racist literary memsahib Yasmin Alibhai-Brown specifies as &#8220;Asian criminal gangs&#8221; are among the worst groups in Lancashire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, &c.;<br>
However, the Government Minister responsible for child protection says on TV that sexual exploitation occurs in &#8220;every village&#8221; in the country and anyone who says it doesn&rsquo;t isn&rsquo;t looking hard enough, i.e. ordinary white-skinned English and Welsh folks are just as bad, but are protected by their racism.<br>
Those whom the gods destroy they first make mad.  <br>

<p>&#8220;If whites had just minded their own business&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your post is just nonsnese. Where to even begin?</p>
<p>The Arabs and Moors invaded Europe and conquered and enslaved the whole Iberian peninsula (modern-day Portugal and Spain) for 700 years. The Arabs also conquered Sicily. The Ottoman Turks and their mid-east minions conquered Constaninople in 1453 and enslaved the whole of the Balkans for almost 500 years. Their cruelty and barbarism was legendary. The Mongols and Tatars conquered and enslaved Russia for centuries. The Barbary pirates enslaved almost two million Europeans only stopping when France invaded them in the 1830&rsquo;s. Going further back in history, ancient Persia attacked Greece, the Asiatic Huns invaded Rome, etc. Europe was the victim of aggression from colored people long before it was able to go on the counter-offensive.<br>
As for claims that China and Japan were &#8220;peaceful&#8221;, Japan&rsquo;s behaviour in the 1930&rsquo; and 40&rsquo;s show this to be ridiculous. China is today absorbing Tibet and the Muslim Uighurs and their land of Xinjiang. China has no rightful claim to either territory.</p>
<p>To Yellow Man;</p>
<p>Some of what you say is accurate, but I would mention that the European period of control of places like India, Indonesia, the Phillippines etc, did not in any way alter the demographic structures of those countries.  </p>

<p>This has been a story since 2004 at least, so 7 years to get this far. - What new laws have been enacted to prevent police from being charge with &#8216;racism&rsquo; for arresting the THOUSANDs of Paki-Pedos? Its going to look pretty bad for the Pakistan immigrants. </p>
<p>Lets see in a year what happens. Probably very little, a few hundred arrests, but it will still go on, too much money to make.</p>

		<p>And where are the families of those girls?Why are they not  protecting their children?  Maybe they can&rsquo;t?  Those girls won&rsquo;t be protected because far from being innocent children they are little sluts already, TV, clothing, make up, boys on their brain since Kindergarten, education and the whole environment. A father trying to protect his daughter, would he wind up in jail&gt; Might be called child abuse.</p>

Welcome to England. Im sure that there are THOUSANDS of stories of these pedos calling the daughters cell phones and the parents answer, and the pedos know they can&rsquo;t do or say anything. </p>
<p>Political Correctness is an act of Genocide, no doubt. It is a crime that should be punished. When will the worm turn? When for god&rsquo;s sake? We have been turned into ZOMBIES.</p>
