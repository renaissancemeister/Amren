<h1>Writer Justifies Racial Profiling</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Smith, The Times Leader, November 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Recently, a case in Kingston brought up the subject of racial profiling. If you take into consideration that blacks commit more than half of the murders in this country, while comprising only 13 percent of the population, isn&rsquo;t racial profiling justifiable?</p>
<p>Whites need to stop walking on eggshells when it comes to the issue of race and crime. We need to stand up and speak out against what is happening to our once-safe communities. Anti-white organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, Southern Poverty Law Center and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People try to push their agendas and extort police, schools and businesses with their often- false claims of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>I, and a few other local activists, have stood up to these tactics and will continue to do so. Hopefully, more people will join us before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Steve Smith</p>

		<p>Say, how did this letter get published?  I&rsquo;m glad it did, of course.  But I would recommend to Mr. Smith that he get an unlisted phone number.</p>

		<p>Kudos to Mr. Smith but I have to wonder if he is self employed or retired to engage in the luxury of speaking the truth with regard to racial differences.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who don&rsquo;t rely on self-employment to earn a living, making such public statements can mean being ostracized and the end of a career. </p>

		<p>Another consideration:  We tolerate and embrace official profiling, and sometimes de jure discrimination, on the basis of gender and age.  Why isn&rsquo;t what is good for the geese of gender and age not good for the ganders of race?</p>

		<p>I did a quick search and he&rsquo;s also active on Stormfront.  He is apparently a bit of a local activist, advocating for the white race in front of a local school board: https://goo.gl/swvX1 .  I&rsquo;m Jewish, and I&rsquo;m not into Stormfront, but I am happy to see someone advocating for the white race.  More of us who are pro-white need to get involved in school boards so we can start giving whites a fair chance at administrative positions etc.</p>

		<p>Best part of the letter was when he trashed the ADL, $PLC and NAACP (New African-American Communist Party)as &#8220;anti-white&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good strategy to put the other side on the defensive.</p>

		<p>The only thing liberals can do to fight the truth is to silence those who try to tell it.  Virtually everyone knows about black crime, and the majority always have.  Anyone who reads social and political commentary on the net certainly knows the facts, whether it&rsquo;s the right giving him the data or the left trying to explain it away.  There always comes a time, however, when the truth can no longer be hidden.  The way black crime is now increasingly spreading into white areas, the media, city governments, and the police ignore the brutal facts at their peril.  When these entities discover that their advertising money and/or jobs are endangered by their continuous lying or ignoring of the truth, the worm will turn  &mdash;  and it has already started to wiggle.<br>
Most lefties actually don&rsquo;t try to insist that black crime is not occurring and ranging out.  They try to give sob-sister reasons for the causes and insist that more government money and perks will help.  After decades of good money after bad, however, almost no one buys this line.  </p>

		<p>#4  &mdash;  That could be a bad thing&hellip;that would make people paint all race-realists with the same &#8220;you&rsquo;re a Nazi&#8221; brush.  </p>
<p>Stormfront disgusts me because the lot of them want to blame the Jews for everything.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that the letter got published&hellip;just too bad it&rsquo;s not from someone not associated with that bunch.</p>
