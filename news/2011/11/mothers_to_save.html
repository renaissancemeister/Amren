<h1><a href="https://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/14-11-2011/119609-russian_mothers-0/">Mothers to Save Russia from Extinction</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pravda, November 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that Russia becomes extinct slowly but surely. According to the UN, Russia is ranked fourth on the list of depopulating countries. To struggle with the crisis, authorities and public organizations elaborate many different programs. One of them is called &#8220;The Holiness of Motherhood.&#8221;<br>
	<br>
UN specialists created the &#8220;map of extinction,&#8221; on which Russia was ranked fourth among other fast-depopulating countries. The company, which Russia has on this list, includes Macao, Hong Kong, Bosnia, Malta, Slovakia, Singapore, Romania, Hungary and Ukraine. If nothing changes for the better, the native population of these countries will disappear by 3200. Russia will become an empty place 350 years earlier than that. To put it in a nutshell, in 800 years, the Russian population (in the modern sense of this word) will become extinct without any wars and cataclysms.</p>
<p>Specialists from the Berlin University delivered a report at the Moscow Carnegie Center not so long ago. The report was titled &#8220;The Disappearing World Superpower.&#8221; According to the report, Russia will naturally lose as many as 35 million people by 2050. The demographic situation in Russia leaves much to be desired indeed. The percentage of large families in the country is small. However, the number of abortions in Moscow alone makes up nearly 50,000 a year (1.5 million in Russia on the whole).</p>
<p>The Russian authorities, the Church and public organization try to do something to struggle with the demographic crisis. The National Glory Center organization, for instance, developed a special program five years ago titled &#8220;The Holiness of Motherhood.&#8221; The basic goal of the program is to form people&rsquo;s attitude to family, motherhood, fatherhood and childhood as life&rsquo;s greatest values by recreating the spiritual and moral potential of the Russian family.</p>
<p>The program works in many Russian cities. One of them is Nizhny Novgorod. The activists of the program have recently conducted a meeting with the students of the Nizhny Novgorod Medical Academy.</p>
<p>The meeting was conducted in a very warm atmosphere. &#8220;We have been running the program for five years already, and we have been working with Nizhny Novgorod for a long time too. In May of this year, we signed an agreement with the municipal administration about the implementation of the program in all directions,&#8221; Natalia Yakunina, a senior spokeswoman for &#8220;The Holiness of Motherhood&#8221; said.</p>
<p>According to the website of the Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, the cooperation with the city and the region will continue. Representatives of the Fund of Apostle Andrei the First Called plan to attend the opening of the shelter for pregnant women. The shelter is being established by the department of the Nizhny Novgorod Eparchy for cooperation with medical and social institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, we conducted the first forum of &#8220;The Holiness of Motherhood&#8221; program. The forum gathered state and church officials, as well as representatives of public organizations from all over the country. Next year, we are going to hold the forum for the second time, and we have a suggestion to hold it in Nizhny Novgorod,&#8221; Natalia Yakunina said.</p>
<p>This year, the events within the scope of &#8220;The Holiness of Motherhood&#8221; program are held in the cities where they take the Belt of Virgin Mary. The arc with the belt visited Nizhny Novgorod on November 4-6. As many as 160,000 people came to worship the sanctuary.</p>

		<p>What about hot water, washing machines and dryers for everyone expected to have children? What about homes with decent space and gardens for a family?  How about civilizing the men away from their drunken depressions and brawl?</p>
<p>Sound like the Russians want to establish a single Mother welfare state like the blacks have in America. Except this being Russia, the Mothers will have to struggle for food, apartments and the necissities of life.</p>
<p>If they gave a decent welfare benefit better than the take home from the average job they will get plenty of Mothers.</p>
<p>This sounds like they Mothers will have to spend their days going from &#8220;helping&#8221; agency to &#8220;helping&#8221; agency to get their welfare doles. </p>

		<p>Excellent! They need more of this throughout Russia, and the West. </p>
<p>They had posters in Nazi Germany that proclaimed, &#8220;Mutter und Kind&#8221;, or &#8220;Mother and Child&#8221;. Amazing how these two countries respected Motherhood, and the rearing of children, yet we are constantly told how terrible they were, or are. </p>

		<p>I am a Nazi hater.  I hate what they did to the Jews and others.  But with that said, I also recognize that not EVERYTHING they believed was wrong.  They believed in eugenics and so do I.  This story reminds of of the old breeding farms the Nazi party had going during WWII.  What goes around, comes around I guess.   </p>

		<p>Who honestly believes that the situation will remain unchanged for 800 years? For all we know humans as a species might be nearly extinct in 800 years.</p>
<p>For the short-term however it is important to try and reach the replacement fertility rate, put an end to the besmirching of Western culture &amp; white people, and stop mass immigration. Doing otherwise is guaranteeing an increase in national unrest that could result in civil war. This is true for all of Europe, the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.<br>

		<p>Did the Irish famine cause the Irish to go extinct?  Of course not. </p>
<p>This nonsense &ldquo;map of extinction&rdquo; is just another UN disinformation and propaganda exercise to bolster the argument for the continued movement of non-whites into historically white lands.</p>

		<p>Countries with high birth rates tend to be socially unstable. This is because large numbers of young men enter job markets with little use for them. Feeling that they have little to live for, they often have little fear of death.<br>
 <br>
A major reason for Islamic terrorism is the high birth rate of Arab countries. A major reason the Soviet Union collapsed with little violence was the low birth rate, and consequently the low percentage of young men, in Russia.<br>

		<p>May it fail sooner rather than later as it must eventually, so that before he dies leaving Russians a dying breed, Putin has no other option than to reverse Modernity and end competition by men and women for jobs and homes and replace the neurosis of pop-culture with reilgion. To whites, Modernity is like an auto-immune disorder: a healthy body attacking itself. </p>

<p>  I don&rsquo;t think these Russians are advocating a high birth rate, but one that is at least at replacement level. The current Russian birth rate is a demographic catastrophe.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re a bit off here.  The reason the Irish did not go extinct during the early 19th century potato famine was because no non-indigenous group or groups was brought in to replace them, and their natural and religious tendency (as was true of even Protestants in the 19th century) was to have large families, thereby recouping losses within a couple generations.</p>
<p>What you say about the UN map of extinction might be true, but it also might be the beginning of conscious concern of what will happen when third world and religiously fanatical people (Muslims) become the rulers.  Even they might understand that the loss of white dominant nations would cause the entire house of cards to collapse.</p>

		<p>Absent religious objections, an organized policy of using<br>
(third world?) maternal surrogates to carry a fetus belonging to<br>
the married couple, might be THE answer? It seems most  middle class women do not intrinsically enjoy pregnancy enough to wish to tolerate it more than once or twice??  </p>
