<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police say they were called Friday to help calm things down among Hispanic and African American students at Highland High School.</p>
<p>Rumors about outsiders coming to the school to fan the flames have APD stationing gang officers on campus next week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One student describes what he saw at school Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody is lined up to go to war basically &hellip; It&rsquo;s just a lot of fear because people are scared for their lives &hellip; people are crying and running and basically scared to death. I know I was,&#8221; the student said.</p>
<p>Albuquerque Public Schools said a fight between two boys on Wednesday caused two different groups to become at odds with each other.</p>
<p>This student said it boils down to a racial conflict.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the black people want to fight the Mexicans and all the Mexicans want to fight the black people  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s as simple as that, that&rsquo;s as simple as you can put it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The students have almost segregated a little bit into their different racial groups  &mdash;  today there was word that there was going to be a large racial fight,&#8221; said APD Sgt. Patrick Ficke.</p>
<p>Because of police presence on Friday, that fight never happened.</p>
<p>Two different Highland parents claim they&rsquo;ve been going to administrators trying to get this problem addressed long before it escalated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to make this stop  &mdash;  they really do. It&rsquo;s about education not about war and that&rsquo;s what all these kids feel like  &mdash;  that they have to fight a war,&#8221; added another parent who wants to remain anonymous.</p>

		<p>Questions that come to mind:</p>
<p>What about the joys of diversity?  </p>
<p>Where are all the liberal whites and jews going into the schools and doing their diversity seminars? What do liberal, diversity activists have to say about that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Albuquerque - I didn&rsquo;t even now there were any blacks there.  How did so many get there?  It&rsquo;s not like there were ever any jobs there. </p>
<p>I wonder if there are any white students in that school.  It seems that everyone gets along with white students (when they&rsquo;re not pushing them around).  I feel bad for any white kids that may be in that school.</p>
<p>By the way, I know a LOT of latinos.  They HATE black people.  <br>
Yo, black people.  Do you see your future in a latino dominated nation?</p>

		<p>Just another example of the consequences of White Oppression against the blacks.</p>
<p>If Whites had not forced the Hispanics into liking the black this would have never happened.</p>
<p>Again White Racism is creating problems for the poor downtrodden black.</p>
<p>If we had allowed the blacks to do what they are best at, like inventing, building, educating we would have a much better America today. An America as great and as advanced as those regions in Africa that are the pride of the world.<br>
1. black hospitals and advances in medicine.<br>
2. black inventions such as the discovery of the atom and the Newport cigarette.<br>
3.Advances in manufacturing whether spears or jet aircraft their skills are beyond description.</p>
<p>No I am convinced all of this rests on the shoulders of the Evil White Racist.</p>
<p>Even today to see the remarkable genius of the black you need look no farther than Washington D.C.</p>

		<p>Thomas W. Chittum made a very good case that a second civil war, mainly a race war, was inevitable. He showed the reasons it will happen, that it has always happened everywhere in the world under these circumstances, and the signs showing when it is about to start. In fact, one can extrapolate from Chittum&rsquo;s demographic analysis that the blacks who are behaving belligerently now are the ones who can least afford to do so because of their demographic situation. He also showed where the safest places to live will be. http://www.archive.org/details/CivilWarIi<br>
<a href="http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/5218675/Civil_War_II__The_Coming_Breakup_Of_America_PDF" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.ee/torrent/5218675/Civil_War_II__The_Coming_Breakup_Of_America_PDF</a><br>
A few of the signs that I can remember off of the top of my head are: <br>
-Police departments will buy and use armored personnel carriers<br>
-there will be ethnic gangs in the military services<br>
-police actions based on ethnicity<br>
-increasing militarization of police<br>
-the white (anlgo) pecentage of population of the U.S. will drop below 70%<br>
-discussion of civil war in mainstream media (this has already happened)<br>
-foreign military forces on U.S. soil (for example the Mexican military marching through Texas to New Orleans, automatic weapons armed guerrillas attacking border patrol agents)<br>
The list goes on and on and almost every single item has already occured. Chittum fought in the vicious ethnic warfare in the former Yugoslavia and he knows what he describes. In 1971 no foreign analyst would have predicted what would occur in Yugosla just 20 years later. Many have the same myopic vision about ethnic civil war here. They are wrong.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s probably all the evil white man&rsquo;s fight why blacks and hispanics are fighting.  I&rsquo;m sure the blacks are once again inncocent victims of racism and have done nothing to provoke the Hispanics either.  (sarcasm)</p>

		<p>Putting aside the fact that the original intent of public education was for students to learn and grow to become adults who contribute to society and become independent in the process, I want to bring up that I vividly remember being a teenager and living with what were roughly weekly cat-fights between girls (where they would attempt to slap and pull hair) and monthly wrestle-fights (no one really wanted fists involved) between guys.  As teenagers, people are emotional.  Testosterone, estrogen, and daily stresses can make young people lose it from time to time.  However, an organized plan to stage a fight smacks of gang activity, at least in this case. The local police gang squad delving into this may help.  A good friend of mine does this type of work and reports success.</p>
<p>We are talking about minorities here but two things need to be stressed: 1. that they are admitting it&rsquo;s racial, which is a stop in the right direction and 2. these are young people whose attitudes can be changed if they forced to see what they&rsquo;re doing is wrong. </p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m being optimistic but if innocent kids are suffering because of those that are not innocent, then the law, adminstrators, and parents must step in.</p>
<p>On a final note, I do wonder if either of the parents who spoke at the end of the video have kids who have voiced racist or bigoted ideas or feelings to them.  If so, what did they do about it? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Why did they let it get this far? If they&rsquo;ve been told by the students, by the children who are there everyday that there&rsquo;s a problem - why did it take this long to do something,&#8221; said one mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody in authority will do ANYTHING until violence breaks out, much blood is spilled, or deaths occur.  That&rsquo;s true with most situations involving any kind of public authority.</p>
<p>However, when the problem of racial turmoil arises, as it always will wherever people of different races are forced to integrate<br>
against their will, the elites refuse to even recognize there is a racial problem, let alone find a solution to it before violence occurs.</p>
<p>These self-appointed multicultural elites know full well that if they bring to the fore local debates on the many problems caused by racial integration/multiculturalism, in order to find a solution to them, would be an admission that diversity is an abysmal failure, so they&rsquo;re not about to find a solution to a situation they refuse to admit is a serious ongoing problem everywhere, not just this school.</p>
<p>Pretending that diversity is a stregth can only be effective if it is accompanied by a constant barrage of brainwashing that touts it as something great and good and its many weaknesses are ignored. They certainly don&rsquo;t want to discus ANYTHING that might reveal that diversity is a weakness.  They have to contine to live the &#8220;Big Lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>They even refer to the racial clashes above as &#8220;two groups:&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Albuquerque Public Schools said a fight between two boys on Wednesday caused two different groups to become at odds with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even bring themselves to say &#8220;races&#8221; instead of &#8220;groups.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s rarely a slow news day on AmRen. Can u imagine if it were whites fighting hispanics? busloads of marchers would have already converged before the final fist blow landed. It would be international news for weeks. The fights - er white oppression -would dredge up images of Nazi&rsquo;s and clan activity in the news. It would spark &#8216;renewed interest&rsquo; in immigration policy and &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;. The full Nazi treatment would be in effect. Since it&rsquo;s african americans the newspapers would likely headline this as &#8216;tension&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Black &amp; Hispanic students segregated (themselves) voluntarily. Hmmm. Imagine that. Call out some liberal White group to moderate this situation and their solution will be to force the students to sit side by side in the classroom and lunchroom. There now, that wasn&rsquo;t so hard was it?<br>

		<p>Great Schools states that this school is 57% Hispanic, 18% White, 13% American Indian, 8% Black and 4% Asian.  So, just looking at it from straight statistics, the odds of Hispanic-White conflagrations are more than twice as likely as Hispanic-Black.  But this school is turning upside down for a 57% demographic battling an 8% demographic.</p>

<p>I suppose I&rsquo;m (tangentially) one of those &#8220;They,&#8221; and frankly I&rsquo;m sick of hearing this stuff. Everything was fine until this society adopted Diversity as a state religion. How is this Our Strength, or even functional in any way?!</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m supposed to be one of the &#8220;They&#8221; that is supposed to make this stuff stop, why don&rsquo;t you empower me instead of criticizing and/or threatening to sue over every move I make? Better yet, why don&rsquo;t you do a better job of raising your kids?!</p>
<p>Maybe the members of our two favorite ethnic groups need to have their own separate schools. The present system is not working, that&rsquo;s for sure!!</p>

		<p>In the end it is about race period.  Us vs them mentality will take over.  All the diversity crap goes out the window and you look for another brother to side you in a fight. mexicans have La Raza and blacks have the NAACP and whites have nothing what so ever. During riots in San Quentin Prison the inmates segregated based on race period.  When blood is on the ground it is only your white brothers you can count on. </p>

		<p>Interesting that the blacks featured don&rsquo;t speak Ghetto. Most locations with small to insignificant black populations seem to have a much higher portion of higher achieving outliers than large, long-established populations in urban centers.   Albuquerque is only about three percent black &amp; I&rsquo;m guessing much of that is due to the Air Force base there. </p>

<p>What governments fear is that the citizens may stop fighting each other and start looking at the government. That&rsquo;s why they think diversity is a good thing, it keep the citizens busy. </p>

		<p>I went to all all white high-school (2 black African students) and four asians (I think that they were all Chinese). We never had any racial tensions whatsoever. I wonder why&hellip;</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of trying to force people to get along we should just give everyone their own space. Stop forced integration, it cultivates racial hatred. People are naturally inclined to prefer their own people. Forcing them together is idiotic. The worst part is that people wonder why American schools now resemble prisons. It should be pretty obvious.</p>

		<p>Poster# 4 wrote about warning signs mentioned in Chittum&rsquo;s coming civil war.  a report about the murder of Border patrol Agent Brian Terry just came out that goes along with Chittum&rsquo;s ideas.  In this case, one of our government agencies, the ATF division of Holder&rsquo;s DOJ gave th weapons to foreign invaders.</p>
<p>Armed illegals stalked Border Patrol<br>
Mexicans were &lsquo;patrolling&rsquo; when agent was slain, indictment says</p>
<p><br>
The Washington Times<br>
Tuesday, November 22, 2011 </p>
<p>Five illegal immigrants armed with at least two AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifles were hunting for U.S. Border Patrol agents near a desert watering hole known as Mesquite Seep just north of the Arizona-Mexico border when a firefight erupted and one U.S. agent was killed, records show.</p>
<p>A now-sealed federal grand jury indictment in the death of Border Patrol agent Brian A. Terry says the Mexican nationals were &ldquo;patrolling&rdquo; the rugged desert area of Peck Canyon at about 11:15 p.m. on Dec. 14 with the intent to &ldquo;intentionally and forcibly assault&rdquo; Border Patrol agents.</p>
<p>At least two of the Mexicans carried their assault rifles &ldquo;at the ready position,&rdquo; one of several details about the attack showing that Mexican smugglers are becoming more aggressive on the U.S. side of the border.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the Mexicans were &ldquo;patrolling the area in single-file formation&rdquo; a dozen miles northwest of the border town of Nogales and  &mdash;  in the darkness of the Arizona night  &mdash;  opened fire on four Border Patrol agents after the agents identified themselves in Spanish as police officers.</p>
<p>Two AK-47 assault rifles found at the scene came from the failed Fast and Furious operation.</p>
<p>Using thermal binoculars, one of the agents determined that at least two of the Mexicans were carrying rifles, but according to an affidavit in the case by FBI agent Scott Hunter, when the Mexicans did not drop their weapons as ordered, two agents used their shotguns to fire &ldquo;less than lethal&rdquo; beanbags at them.</p>
<p>At least one of the Mexicans opened fire and, according to the affidavit, Terry, a 40-year-old former U.S. Marine, was shot in the back. A Border Patrol shooting-incident report said that Terry called out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hit,&rdquo; and then fell to the ground, a bullet having pierced his aorta. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t feel my legs,&rdquo; Terry told one of the agents who cradled him. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m paralyzed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bleeding profusely, he died at the scene.</p>
<p>After the initial shots, two agents returned fire, hitting Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, 33, in the abdomen and leg. The others fled. The FBI affidavit said Osorio-Arellanes admitted during an interview that all five of the Mexicans were armed.</p>
<p>Peck Canyon is a notorious drug-smuggling corridor.</p>
<p>Osorio-Arellanes initially was charged with illegal entry, but that case was dismissed when the indictment was handed up. It named Osorio-Arellanes on a charge of second-degree murder, but did not identify him as the likely shooter, saying only that Osorio-Arellanes and others whose names were blacked out &ldquo;did unlawfully kill with malice aforethought United States Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry while Agent Terry was engaged in &hellip; his official duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The indictment also noted that Osorio-Arellanes had been convicted in Phoenix in 2006 of felony aggravated assault, had been detained twice in 2010 as an illegal immigrant, and had been returned to Mexico repeatedly.</p>
<p>Bill Brooks, U.S. Customs and Border Protection&rsquo;s acting southwest border field branch chief, referred inquiries to the FBI, which is conducting the investigation. The FBI declined to comment.</p>
<p>The case against Osorio-Arellanes and others involved in the shooting has since been sealed, meaning that neither the public nor the media has access to any evidence, filings, rulings or arguments.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in San Diego, which is prosecuting the case, would confirm only that it was sealed. Also sealed was the judge&rsquo;s reason for sealing the case.<br>

		<p>These problems are a direct result of &#8220;diversity&#8221; dogma.   Diversity dogma tells every brown skinned person that they are the cat&rsquo;s meow just because they aren&rsquo;t white.   Now we&rsquo;ve got millions of black and brown narcissists running around thinking they are royalty, demanding that all others bow down before them.   Whites, on the other hand, have humility and shame driven into their heads; so they keep a low profile and avoid instigating racial problems.   Whites only come into the story when they get attacked by mobs of blacks for sport.   This is what the news services call a &#8220;fight&#8221; or a &#8220;scuffle.&#8221;   If it were a crowd of whites attacking a lone black for sport, then it would be called a hate crime. </p>

		<p>So I guess the minority youth of America do actually care about their futures.<br>
If one group eliminates the other then the winner gets to live off the entitlements payed for by the White man&rsquo;s dollars.</p>

<p>The only way to solve this problem would be to send him back to Mexico in a box.<br>

		<p>The Hispanics have hated blacks for hundreds of years, and if you go to countries like Cuba or Honduras or Panama not to mention most of South America, you will see this hatred profoundly displayed in their every day conversations.  White people were not to blame;  there it was the actions of the black people that created this animosity displayed by Hispanics towards them ! </p>

		<p>The good news is this will continue and spread. I&rsquo;m so happy blacks are getting what they did to us. Here in NY in the 80s, Italians (like me) abused blacks in schools. They&rsquo;re spineless when confronted with a group who does not tolerate their behavior. Plain and simple. Blacks are in for a tough future with Hispanics growing in numbers. They have no White guilt to hold them down. </p>
