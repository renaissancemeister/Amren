			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Florida authorities had a real Halloween scare on their hands when a pint-sized perp&rsquo;s raging tantrum turned into a vicious assault case.</p>
<p>Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies said the 9-year-old girl faces multiple felony charges after a fit of rage that started on her bus yesterday.</p>
<p>Police were called to Atlanta Avenue and Kingston Drive East over the disturbance.</p>
<p>The bus driver told officers the ordeal began as the girl was told to stop eating candy on the bus.   </p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office said the girl jumped off the bus after spitting and cursing at the driver and allegedly threatening to hit other children. </p>
<p>The girl will not be identified due to her age.</p>
<p>She then began throwing pieces of asphalt at the bus, hitting the windshield next to the driver.</p>
<p>As the deputy approached, he saw the girl throwing the asphalt while shouting at the driver: &#8216;Shut the f*ck up! I will f*cking kill you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Authorities said the girl walked away when she saw the deputy. </p>
<p>But when she realized the deputy was following her, she picked up a metal chair in a nearby yard and threw it at him.</p>
<p>As the deputy informed her that she was under arrest, the girl resisted by wildly kicking and trying to push him.</p>
<p>The girl, who tried to bite the officer as she was taken into custody, was booked into the Lee County Jail.</p>
<p>She has been charged with battery on a school employee and a law enforcement office, as well as throwing a deadly missile into an occupied vehicle and resisting arrest.</p>

		<p>She sure looks older than 9! With the black tendency to hit puberty early this would not be unusual. Unfortunately she will probably get an NAACP lawyer who will argue to allow her to return to school since she has a &#8220;right&#8221; to attend school no matter how much she terrorizes other students and staff. </p>

		<p>How does a child of this age  have so much violent hatred toward authority figures ? I can only imagine the home life she is subjected and exposed to, with all that hatred being taught or exibited by her parents.</p>
<p>She appears to have good prospects at a local Big Mac for a manager position.</p>

		<p>This is diversity and multiculturalism at its very finest. We should not impede this girls progress. She could become the first lady or something. Perhaps, since her culture is equal to that of original Americans, she might build the next booster rocket to take us to some new planet or other. Or perhaps she will get the peace prize. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism does nothing but split the unity of our society and balkanize different tribes into groups that can never be reconciled. The sooner we citizens recognize this, the sooner we can get the socialists out of our hair.</p>

		<p>I`ve always remembered a scene from the movie Empire of the Sun. It showcased both the limitations of being a child and the foolishness of The West. It`s the one where the ten year old English boy finds his way home days after the chaos of the Japanese invasion. He sees the formerly docile and loyal Chinese house servant helping herself to the family`s heirloom furniture. He yells at her in protest, and she quietly and casually walks over and slaps him hard across the mouth. The look on his face is the one I`m sure we`ll be seeing a lot more of as our country becomes under the control of those that used to work for us and we foolishly allowed to take over&hellip;</p>

		<p>White liberals will jump all over this and blame the cops, the bus driver, white &#8216;racism&rsquo; and everything under the sun.  They will excuse this girl&rsquo;s violence and say she needs counseling and lots of other expensive things that they will want us to pay for through taxes.  I know a lot of liberal women like this who always make excuses for the little darlin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The thing is, I worked for a while in a place with a lot of black kids from ten to fifteen years old.  You would not believe how many of them had arrest records.  Some of them were so violent I felt uneasy around them.  And some of those black kids were really BIG, like as big as me, and I&rsquo;m a 5.5 foot tall woman.</p>
<p>A big-boned, over-developed young kid can cause a lot of damage.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, blacks are losing it all over.  Part of it is no doubt the carte blanche attitude that Obama and Holder have given them, but now I think they see the writing on the wall as far as their boy&rsquo;s (non) re-election.  They seem to be freaking out over practically nothing.  The other day, as I was about to leave to do errands, I remembered that I&rsquo;d forgotten to order some boots from a catalog.  Rather than dial back into my slow internet service, I just picked up the phone to call.  The sales rep was a black woman who, firstly, got peeved when I asked her to explain the sum of the charges.  Then, when I refused to accept one of those offers for so-called health &#8220;insurance&#8221;, she started wheedling and actually arguing with me!  I&rsquo;ve endured these types of offers for years, but always when I told the rep I wasn&rsquo;t interested, that was it.  I got absolutely loud and rude with this woman, and she still wouldn&rsquo;t stop.  I was determined to have the final say and finally did, but it took me hours to get over the amazement at her attitude and gall.  </p>

<p>Ah, TNB superstar Semaj.</p>
<p>Police files: Car chase, jets, theft, 9-year-old <br>
PAUL SAND; The News Tribune<br>
Published: January 17th, 2007 01:00 AM </p>
<p>Semaj Booker hated living in Washington. </p>
<p>And he desperately wanted to see his grandfather down in Texas.</p>
<p>So the 9-year-old Lakewood boy went to desperate lengths to get to Dallas, police say, running away from home Monday, hopping a Southwest Airlines flight from Sea-Tac Airport to Phoenix on Tuesday, then a flight to San Antonio, where he was finally taken into custody.</p>
<p>And all this after the 80-pound fourth-grader led police on a high-speed chase in a stolen car Sunday night, authorities said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to live in Washington state,&rdquo; said Lakewood police Lt. Dave Guttu. He&rsquo;s &ldquo;incredibly motivated to get to Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Semaj, who could be charged in connection with the police pursuit as early as today, was being held Tuesday night at a juvenile detention facility in San Antonio, Guttu said.</p>

		<p>I was riding a bus years ago and a black girl got on eating an icecream cone. The driver, a black man, told her she could not ride with the cone and had to get off. &#8220;You&rsquo;re gonna get a surprise when I get off this bus,&#8221; she said.  The driver replied, &#8220;Honey, nothing you do would surprise me, now get off my bus.&#8221; The girl put the cone on the seat next to her, smashed the icecream into the seat cushion then ran off the bus.</p>

		<p>Note to Olewhitelady: at one point in time I was nice to these rude Blacks one sometimes gets on the phone and to those I couldn&rsquo;t understand because of their accents, but now I am not.  There is no real point in being rude back.  (But if you find yourself having a trying day, by all means vent your steam or your sarcasm on a rude phone person as opposed to someone you have to see every day in your household.  This decreases future unpleasantness for yourself and can be a mild form of entertainment)  To resume: there is no point in being rude yourself, however you CAN ask to talk to someone else.  This request will be honored by all but the very worst employees.  If they are being rude ask to talk to their supervisor, if they have a hard to understand accent just say, &ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t understand you, can you please let me talk to another customer representative?&rdquo;  You may have to add, &ldquo;Thank you for trying to help me but I REALLY need to talk to someone else.&rdquo;  Who cares if they think you are a nasty old White lady?  If enough people did this, more Whites would be hired to man the phones.</p>
<p>Many companies that have customer calls handled in India, still have phone reps in the U.S. too.  You can request that your phone call is handled by staff in the U.S. and not by the offshore call center.  You may have to call the companies cooperate offices and insist you do not want to talk to the Indian call center and get another phone number to call (maybe not toll-free), but it is worth doing!<br>

		<p>It is too late  &mdash;  this is a child that needs to be put in a cage and kept there. <br>
Do you really want your little third grader put in a room with an unrestrained child who will scream, curse, throw chunks of asphalt, hit, kick and bite ADULTS? Police officers even? Over a piece of CANDY? <br>
Find her parents and sterilize them. They are unfit to raise children, or if not, they have a bad genetic mix to produce one like this.  </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the case in Portland, OR a while back when police had to use force to subdue a 12 year old girl they were arresting, because she resisted with such violence.  I think they fired a bean bag round that hit her in the leg.  The local media were all over the story, breathlessly repeating their spin that the big bad police officers had used force against a &#8220;12 year old child&#8221; or a &#8220;little girl&#8221;, yet strangely never seemed to mention that this &#8220;little girl&#8221; was already 5&rsquo;8&#8221; and 170 lbs at 12. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t normally comment, but I feel compelled to comment on this story.  Yes, this child&rsquo;s actions are horrific, but one has to wonder just what is going on in the house where this child crashes at night?  I don&rsquo;t say &#8220;home,&#8221; and I don&rsquo;t say &#8220;sleeps&#8221; or &#8220;lives.&#8221;  It is painfully obvious  &mdash;  at least to me  &mdash;  that this child simply does what she has to survive in whatever hell hole she has to return to at night.  I feel terribly sorry for her and my heart goes out to her.  The saddest part of all is that, even if she were adopted or taken in by decent people, she would never be right  &mdash;  not with such hatred and violence already in her heart.  Well, maybe that&rsquo;s only the sadder part.  The saddest part is that she will not be placed in a home, institution, or hospital that can try to teach her some coping skills and proper behavior and keep her in a place safe for her and for the public at large; she will end up in juvenile hall, where she will become even more hardened, be turned loose when she&rsquo;s an adult, and end up killing someone.</p>

<p>Again with the presumption that anyone with a heart is a liberal (how insulting!), a bleeding heart, etc., etc.  For your information, I was born in, grew up in, and still live in a Southern town with a higher violent crime rate than that of NYC, per FBI statistics  &mdash;  simply because my family settled where they could afford to live and I do not have the money to move . Why is our crime rate so high?  Because we are plagued with blacks.  Why do I read AmRen?  Because I don&rsquo;t like blacks any more than you do  &mdash;  and probably am more prejudiced than just about anybody on this board. I have had to go to school with them, live amongst them, TRY to teach them, watch my family and others be victimized by them, and deal with them on a daily basis because my family had NO money and unfortunately had to live in what once was white town, but quickly became black town because of forced integration.  Why didn&rsquo;t I mention the poor whites (like myself) who don&rsquo;t usually do what blacks do?  Because it wasn&rsquo;t germane (look it up) to the story.  I don&rsquo;t need to read any stories on the genetic failings of blacks  &mdash;  I have been aware of said inferiority my entire life.  But if you think that my prejudice makes me cold-hearted enough not to feel sorry for a 9-year-old who is so far gone already(and who, by the way, is apparently not even 100% black per her photograph), you are sadly mistaken.  I am not a heartless creature like those I despise.  As for what I do with my life and where I do it, that&rsquo;s my business.  Have a nice day!  :)</p>

<p>You are a good person.  Not all of us who have our lives ruined by blacks feel the same way.</p>

		<p>Curious- I&rsquo;m from India and have skin darker than most Blacks. If I went to your town, would the blacks kill me for &#8216;acting white&rsquo;? We Indians are small, delicate, and very morally conservative.</p>
