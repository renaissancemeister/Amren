				U.S. Pressures Cargill on Job-Bias Complaint
			</h1>
			<p>
				Scott Kilman, Wall Street Journal, November 30, 2011
			</p>
			<div class="lead">
				Company allegedly favors Asians and Pacific Islanders.
			</div>
			
				<p>
					The U.S. Labor Department, trying to force Cargill Inc. to settle job-discrimination allegations lodged by the agency, is seeking to cancel meat contracts it says are worth more than $550 million that the closely held Minneapolis commodity-processing giant has with the U.S. military.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Labor Department, which has the authority to audit the hiring practices of companies that do business with the federal government, said Tuesday that its contract-compliance office filed an administrative complaint aimed at Cargill&rsquo;s turkey-processing plant in Springdale, Ark.
				</p>
				<p>
					The complaint, filed with the Labor Department&rsquo;s administrative law judges, alleges that managers at the turkey plant unfairly preferred to hire Asian-American and Pacific Islander applicants over other racial groups, including blacks, Hispanics and whites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cargill, which has its headquarters in suburban Minneapolis, denied the discrimination allegations, which it said were based on the department&rsquo;s faulty interpretation of historical hiring statistics &#8220;and not reality,&#8221; said Mike Martin, a Cargill spokesman, who added that 84% of Cargill&rsquo;s Springdale workers are minorities.
				</p>

					Cargill&rsquo;s Springdale turkey plant was linked to last summer&rsquo;s food-poisoning outbreak caused by an antibiotic-resistant strain of salmonella. {snip}
