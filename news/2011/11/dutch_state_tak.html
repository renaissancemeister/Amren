<h1>Dutch State Taken to UN Human Rights Commission over Wilders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dutch News, November 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three Dutch Moroccans have made a complaint against the Netherlands to the UN commission for human rights, claiming the Dutch state has not protected them from incitement to hatred instigated by Geert Wilders, Nos television reports.</p>
<p>The three, who are not named in the court filing, say the &#8216;systematic incitement to hatred and discrimination against Muslims and other migrants&rsquo; committed by Wilders has left them feeling &#8216;discriminated against, humiliated and threatened&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are of the opinion that Wilders by his continued hate speech has poisoned the social climate in the Netherlands that has become more and more anti-migrant and anti-Muslim,&rsquo; the statement says.</p>
<p>Wilders was taken to court for discrimination and inciting hatred last year but found not guilty this spring after the public prosecution department called for all charges to be dropped.</p>
<p><strong>One-sided</strong></p>
<p>The reluctance of the public prosecutor to take action against Wilders meant the &#8216;judge [at that trial] was only provided with one side of the legal argument due to the almost perfect harmony between the prosecution and defence,&rsquo; the UN filing states.</p>
<p>The three say international human rights treaties should protect them against discrimination and the UN commission should ensure those treaties are upheld.</p>
<p>A UN human rights commission ruling, which can take years, is not legally binding, Nos says.</p>

		<p>If the Moroccans feel &#8220;threatened&#8221;, they should do what whites would do.</p>
<p>After the end of white European colonialism in the last century, many whites who felt threatened voluntarily returned to their homelands.</p>

		<p>&#8220;left them feeling &lsquo;discriminated against, humiliated and threatened&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet not one word about how so many practitioners of the &#8216;religion of peace&rsquo; has humiliated, discriminated or threatened them or the West proper.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of Wilders and I hope every Muslim leeching upon the West feels threatened by him and others like him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re coming, Muslims, and it&rsquo;s not going to be pretty.</p>

<p>So tell the U.N. to take a hike and kick the three &#8220;Dutch Moroccan&#8221; bums out. Problem solved.<br>
The U.N. wouldn&rsquo;t last a day if all the 1st world countries would stop paying their dues and start ignoring all their &#8220;rulings&#8221;. We need to put a flame under this paper tiger - the U.N. - once and for all, they&rsquo;ve been a thorn in our side for much too long now!</p>

		<p>I wonder if Pim Fortuyn and Theo Van Gogh felt hated and discriminated against not all that long ago in the Netherlands.  I wish I could ask them.  I wish I could ask the 100 who were killed after a Northern European newspaper published some cartoons.  I wonder if Gregorius Nekschot has an opinion.  Hard to say, as this Netherlands cartoonist must live in hiding under a fake name lest anti-cartoon Muslims find him.</p>
<p>So much turmoil in Northern Europe.  I can&rsquo;t see why any Muslim would want to stay.<br>

<p>- I see this coming as well.  It is certainly the case where Muslims are invading the West with the idea of taking over.  At some point, the West will have to either fight or die. If we choose to just roll over and die, then we deserve our fate. But if we choose to fight, then not only are we the target of Islam, but all of Islam comes into our crosshairs as well, and we&rsquo;ll then have the next world war. Either way, it appears we are heading for some sad times.  The &#8220;good fences makes good neighbors&#8221; saying remains a truism.</p>

		<p>If these Muslims were capable of such objectivity, it would be worth their time to ask themselves who really belongs in the Netherlands and who does not. They would need to lay aside all the foolishness about the expansion of Islam, and think objectively about whose land this really is. Now I realize that what I have proposed is beyond the realm of reality, so the alternative is that they can simply leave without understanding why. They don&rsquo;t belong there, and that is reason enough. There is no place for Muslims anywhere in the West. They must all go back where they came from, every last one of them.</p>

		<p>Europeans NEED to start demanding their basic HUMAN RIGHTS be met. Especially INDIGENOUS RIGHTS.<br>
It&rsquo;s the same thing with Muslims complaining about Crosses etc<br>
We need to start complaining about mosques being built everywhere with OUR tax payers money. We NEED to complain about the degenerate art like &#8220;piss Christ&#8221;. If it is good for one it is good for the other!</p>

		<p>The words &#8216;5th column&rsquo; spring to mind.<br>
Here we have a situation where Moroccans resident in the Netherlands are appealing to a foreign power (&#8216;crying to mommy&rsquo;), to interfere and punish the legitimate and democratically elected government of the state they voluntarily chose to live in.<br>
 No other state in no other time period than the present would have tolerated this.<br>

		<p>I hope our three poor discriminated Muslims will also file a complaint with the UN Human Rights Commission about the mistreatment of Christians in Muslim countries.  From Egypt via Iraq and Pakistan to Indonesia Christians are regularly not only discriminated but often actually murdered,a far more serious thing than the &#8220;suffering&#8221;of these poor Muslims who feel discriminated,  humiliated and threatened by the critical words of a politician.</p>

		<p>One thinks what one wants about Geert Wilders, but he channels Islamo-skepticism in a peaceful track. Reactions are becoming more and more aggressive:</p>
