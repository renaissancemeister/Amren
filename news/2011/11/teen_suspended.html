			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS New York, November 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 14-year-old New Jersey girl has been suspended for wearing a sweatshirt with a Confederate flag on it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Torri Albrecht said Monday when she showed up to her middle school wearing a sweatshirt with the confederate flag. She said her vice principal gave her a choice:</p>
<p>&#8220;He said I had to take off the sweatshirt or flip it inside out or face the consequences,&#8221; Albrecht said.</p>
<p>But the eighth grader, who was born in Virginia and lived there just a year, said she refused to take it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows I am from the South. I am proud of where I came from and it shows my heritage,&#8221; Albrecht said.</p>
<p>The teenager&rsquo;s mother, who took a picture at the Kreps Middle School, said her daughter was suspended for not changing into something else  &mdash;  a violation, she said, of her First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian kids get to wear turbans. The Jewish children can wear yarmulkes. That&rsquo;s their birth right, their heritage. It&rsquo;s my daughter&rsquo;s heritage,&#8221; said Jane West, Albrecht&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>An assistant superintendent said Albrecht was not suspended for the sweatshirt but for a confidentiality policy they can&rsquo;t discuss.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got the suspension slip it said she was disrespectful when asked to remove her sweatshirt,&#8221; West said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the teenager, who said she&rsquo;s receiving death threats, insisted, &#8220;Everyone who wears it isn&rsquo;t racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Albrecht said she wants to be transferred to a new school district and want to wear her sweatshirt there. Albrecht&rsquo;s mother said she plans on suing her current school district.</p>

		<p>The haters of White people keep denying us our right to our freedom to speak and display symbols that some of us believe are important to us and they&rsquo;re often doing it, as is the case here, by saying the speech or symbols might upset others.</p>
<p>Well, screw the others.  We have a right to be who and what we are and we have a right to display our symbols.</p>

<p>Death threats against someone for their heritage? That sounds like a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. So what&rsquo;s the school doing about it??? They&rsquo;d better be doing something or the family really will have grounds for a lawsuit. By discriminating against the girl&rsquo;s heritage they&rsquo;ve created a hostile situation where she&rsquo;s receiving death threats.</p>

		<p>Had the South won the war, would they suspend her for wearing old glory?  Maybe!</p>
<p>I have worn a British flag shirt and some people mistake it for the Confederate Flag.  These are generally pseudo intellectuals pointing out my ignorance.</p>
<p>Most teachers and administrators are pretty left leaning since they belong to a powerful union.   They have had the &#8220;we are all equal&#8221; nonsense pounded into their brains since college and they never miss an opportunity to kiss a little black rear.<br>

		<p><i>Had the South won the war, would they suspend her for wearing old glory?</i></p>
<p>The newly independent (ephemerally so, as it turned out) CSA seriously considered using the American flag as its national flag.  Question:  Do American schools suspend students who wear the Union Jack or St. George&rsquo;s Cross?  That would be a similar scenario to a hypothetically independent CSA vis-a-vis American flags in schools.</p>
<p><i>I have worn a British flag shirt and some people mistake it for the Confederate Flag</i></p>
<p>I have heard cases of white men being beaten up in jail by blacks because their Reebok shoes had the Union Jack, the dumb blacks all think it&rsquo;s a CBF.</p>

		<p>I simply think that this old flag of the confederacy is attractive, and far more attractive than the circus style banner that the U.S. flag emulates.  As one with ancestors from both sides of the conflict, I simply see the flag as a symbol against the idea of a too strong, too central style of government.  It is the ultimate flag for the individual.  But that&rsquo;s just me.</p>

		<p>So, where are the Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy and all those other Southern Pride Ra Ra Ra for the old South groups that dress up in Gray for their Civil War re-inactments?  They should all put on their confederate soldier costumes and break out thier confederate flags and go camp out in the Melvin Krepps Middle School&rsquo;s parking lot to support this brave young girl.  Anyone out there seen Birth of a Nation?  This could be a little sister moment.  I&rsquo;m up here in Chicago, but this Copperhead would go carry your confederate flag if the rest of you rebels would get up and stand up for your own heritage.  You can bet you boots, a rebel encampment at that school would make every other school think twice about making an issue of that flag.</p>

		<p>The ignorami complaining about the confederate battle flag need to learn what the War Between the States was really all about and that the version taught in high schools is collectivist, marxist propaganda and garbage! In fact, what is commonly taught about the War Between the States is actually a bunch of out and out lies! The southern flags have nothing to do with promoting slavery at all!  As Thomas De Lorenzo shows in his books The Real Lincloln and Lincoln Unmasked the real truth of the matter is that:</p>
<p>-the conflict was due to the north imposing strangling tariffs that were against the best interests  of the south<br>
-the conflict also involved Lincoln and the north promoting corporate interests that were at odds with the law and the Constitution, corporations had been severely limited in their activity and immunity through limited charters, the war greatly empowered corporate interests<br>
-the north started the war, not the south, the northern states were the aggressors<br>
-Lincoln was a tyrant and a dictator<br>
-many of Lincolns orders were extremely unconstitutional<br>
-it was well accepted before the war that all states had the right to secede from the union that they had created <br>
-Lincolns aggression against the south was unconstitutional<br>
-most southern Whites had no stake in slavery whatsoever and had nothing to do with it	<br>
-Lincoln wished to send the Blacks back to Africa<br>
-Lincoln did not believe Blacks to be the equals of Whites<br>
-Lincoln intended not to free the Blacks<br>
-slavery would soon have been ended without war for several reasons<br>
-the northern states committed war crimes against southern Whites and Blacks<br>
-Lincoln and others wished to prevent Blacks from going west, he did not wish to have black labor move west as it was put in those days</p>

		<p>Wrap the confederate flag around your face in the form of a muslim Burqa and then you can wear it even when you have your driver&rsquo;s license picture taken.</p>
<p>In all earnestness, though, my mother&rsquo;s side of the family is southern and my father&rsquo;s is northern. I recall them arguing heatedly about &#8220;Northern Aggression&#8221; when I was younger and thinking it was just a bunch of sour grapes. Flash-forward twenty years and pretty much every book I&rsquo;ve read on the period (especially the time known as &#8220;Bleeding Kansas&#8221;) in the contested territories, shows that the Union troops did in fact commit atrocities against Southerners as bad as My Lai. John Brown who is most famous as an abolitionist martyr actually castrated, murdered, and  raised the farms of innocent southerners in his bloodlust.</p>
<p>This is all well-documented, but don&rsquo;t expect Ken Burns to roll up his sleeves and get to work setting the record straight.</p>

		<p>Her clothing did not display gang signs or symbols, obscene statements, suggestive sexual comments, alcohol or drug logos, weapons or nudity. So, she was well within her rights to wear that shirt. She was not in violation of the school&rsquo;s dress code. So what was the real reason. It would appear this racist assistant principal either hates the goyim or whites depending on which assistant principal attemped to have her remove her clothing.  </p>

		<p>Well the girl and her rather ignoramus mother deserved the treatment from the school. First of all, get over it - the North WON and the south LOST. Any such bitterness and delusion of grandiosity about this &#8220;old glory&#8221; is irrelevant. No one cares. We live in the United States of America and NOT the Con-federate States of America. Our flag and heritage is the beautiful stars and stripes and not some rebel rag which belongs to bitter losers. Had this girl worn an American flag to show her heritage or even an ethnic European flag - Irish Shamrock/ German flag etc. No one would in their right mind would have any problem. Infact, I would have fully supported her cause. You have the right to be proud of your Irish or German heritage after all. However, the con-federate flag DOES represent the most nefarious aspects of American history - racism, segregation, slavery, oppression, ignorance and collosial stupidity. To wear this icon of imbecility is a disgrace to any high IQ American. The south needs to adopt the Stars and Stripes and get rid of the symbol of defeat - the Rebel flag, ususally associated with low IQ, under-educated, low income hard core Christian conservative rednecks!</p>

<p>Your screed has less to do with a flag and more to do with your prejudice against Southerners. But you should realize that denigration only strengthens our identity. Of course, I would have valued my heritage regardless. But it was run-ins with a few unpleasant people such as yourself that really cemented my resolve. I can only hope that my children run into someone like you so that they&rsquo;ll develop the same determination.</p>

		<p>Well, Liberal Weiss, I guess if you&rsquo;re low IQ, under-educated, low income hard core Christian conservative redneck, you have every reason to wear the flag. So&hellip;What&rsquo;s the problem? It&rsquo;s their heritage, let them wear it. Or do you propose that you are superior to them and therefore have the right to determine what&rsquo;s best for them?</p>
<p>By the way, what&rsquo;s wrong with having a low IQ? You&rsquo;re born like that, nothing you could do about it. Remember, blacks have one of the lowest average IQs of all the races, are you saying that there&rsquo;s something wrong with them? Miss Liberal Weiss.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what&rsquo;s wrong with being a low income, hard core, Christian conservative redneck? Are you saying that only sub-human rednecks do these types of jobs or are Christian conservatives? Do you have a problem with these people? Do you believe they should be exterminated for the good of mankind? Be honest now, my dear.</p>
<p>Yea, I think your intentions are pretty clear. </p>
<p>The Confederate flag represents defiance. It&rsquo;s the perfect symbol for a Real American to wear. I would wear it. Simply to anger you, if for no other reason at all! </p>

<p>This lifelong Yankee and Christian conservative (and descendant of at least two Union veterans) sees nothing wrong with the Confederate flag.  I might add that if my IQ was low, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been in accelerated/gifted classes in school.</p>
<p>The &#8220;ignorance and colossal stupidity&#8221; is coming from YOUR direction.  Perhaps you should actually read a few articles from this site.  Anti-racism is ignorance.  Stop pretending we&rsquo;re all the same, because we&rsquo;re not.  It&rsquo;s not hate to point out our differences.  (Then again, truth is hate to those who hate truth.)</p>

		<p>Liberal Weiss, I would be willing to bet you have absolutely no idea the history behind the Confederate battle flag (without googling it or using wikipedia). It is a St. Andrew&rsquo;s Cross and there are many intelligent, decent people who display it.  The very fact that you used overly emotional rhetoric to express your grief with the flag reeks of personal insecurity and sounds more like a temper tantrum than a point.  There is absolutely nothing racist about the southern version of the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Cross, so please, get your facts straight.  You know, the American flag was also used during eras of racial turmoil.  Does this mean that flag is also a symbol of &#8220;racism&#8221;?  There are many books out there on the topic, I suggest you read one.  </p>

		<p>Before the Stars and Bars battle flag, the flag appearing on Ms. Albrecht&rsquo;s sweatshirt, the lower Southern states, the first to secede, adopted the Bonnie Blue Flag, a single yellow star on a blue field.  I wear a Bonnie Blue Flag lapel pin almost everywhere I go, in honor of the Southern cause.  Only rarely do I get asked about it, and, when I do, I explain.  I decided against a Stars and Bars lapel pin, because I did not want to invite the kind of everyday hassling [vide @ 19] Albrecht now endures.</p>
<p>In front of City Hall in San Francisco, there is a plaza with numerous flagpoles displaying various flags from American history.  The story is told that the City gave up hoisting the Stars and Bars because San Francisco juries would not convict those vandalizing this particular flag. </p>

		<p>Hey Liberal Weiss, do you have any problem with all the Mexican flags flying in our country?  Are you intelligent enough to associate the Mexican flag with a country full of ignorant, corrupt, and generally dysfunctional people?  And do you have any problem with the millions of ignorant criminals and their flags invading our country or is it just White people you are able to pass judgement on?  My father and brother both spilled their blood defending this country and it&rsquo;s flag, and I can respect the reverance Southerners have for THEIR flag.  Why can&rsquo;t you?  If you were&rsquo;nt so ignorant you would know the stars and stripes flew over states that allowed slavery during the second war of independence.  Should we shun that flag too? If the NAACP and it&rsquo;s fifth column supporters like yourself have their way, that flag will be verboten too someday.</p>

		<p>Years ago, I was coming up from Camp Legune on a weekend pass to NYC. There was an area known as the circle at the base where guys would meet and catch a ride to wherever they were going on Fri. evening. I had some extra duty and went a bit late. There were few cars then and the guy who showed up didn&rsquo;t have much money or gas (it was $7 a head). So we waited around to fill up the car and finally a black guy showed up to fill the car. We knew if we took him we wouldn&rsquo;t be stopping before DC. So we took him anyway and when we got above DC, we all wanted something to eat and we finally pulled off the road and went to a diner in NJ. The owner came out and told us, he&rsquo;d serve us, but he wouldn&rsquo;t serve the black guy (he didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;black guy&#8221;). Being all Yankees and polite, we all ordered to go. So much for that Mason-Dixon line stuff. </p>

		<p>All cultures and heritages have their dark spots. To claim that states&rsquo; rights or tariffs were the cause of confederate secession is simply disingenuous. It was slavery, whether that meant slavery in the west or simply protecting slavery in the states it was still legal. It doesn&rsquo;t make the Confederacy evil to admit this.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen, southerners were right about the inability of many blacks to behave lawfully. Appeasing and reigning them in costs billions. Not only that, miscegenation has doomed the US to future has been status, not unlike Egypt.</p>
<p>Slavery is horrible, but let&rsquo;s remember who still practices it today. Let&rsquo;s not forget the color of the people the word was named after. Son or daughter of the old confederacy, don&rsquo;t let anachronistic values taint the view of your ancestors. At the same time, don&rsquo;t run from the truth.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t we being a bit disingenuous here?  Does anybody really think that such a symbol wouldn&rsquo;t have provoked a whole variety of hostile actions and that Amber, or whatever her name is, probably knew that the shirt would stir up a mess of burnt grits.  Whatever your opinion of black, surely you have to admit that the Confederate Flag represents a historical movement identified with slavery and racism and to try and imagine that it only is emblematic of one&rsquo;s Southern heritage is being almost willfully naive.  Besides that, the girl only lived in Virginia for a year according to the article so it&rsquo;s hard for me to understand the depth of her attachment to her &#8220;Southern heritage&#8221;</p>

<p>I am thinking that the Stars and Bars, which is often confused with the original Betsy Ross Stars and Stripes, due to a sheer abundance of ignorance on the part of the Tolerant types, would be a great flag shirt to wear.</p>

		<p>Having recently traveled in the South with some Northerners I was surprised that some of them thought the Confederate flag was a racist symbol.  Yet the Southerners see it as a symbol of regional pride.  A land of charm, community and a way of life.  I think the school and many Northerners have somehow morphed the flags symbolism into something it is not by the users.  Further, Freedom of expression would dictate that the flag is a perfectly protected symbol.  If you want to get excited, see the video clips of a La Raza rally where US flags are trod upon and Mexican flags are held high.  </p>

		<p>According to the school&rsquo;s Parent Handbook, if they thought the student was in the wrong, could have given 1) A warning. 2) Temporary removal from class. 3) Deprivation of privileges. 4) Detention. or 5) Suspension. Though this student had not violated the dress code, the intolerant, assistant principal enraged with hatred of the goyim and or white people chose to suspend this student. Though she has a case against the school, because this girl is a white, you&rsquo;ll not hear a peep from the ACLU or the SPLC. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to point out to you that recently a court judge dismissed freedom of speech suits against students who told to not wear American flags.</p>
<p>You better wake up.  This is about racism against whites and a wiping away of YOUR rights.  You may not agree with what this girl did, but she had the right to do it.  That right has now been stripped from both her and YOU, because of the color of your skin.</p>
<p>What other rights have you lost?  Do you bother to know or care?  Will you care when a gang of blacks sodomizes you in broad daylight and you discover that, due to jury nullification you no longer have a right to justice in the courts.  Because of liberals in your state, you no longer have a right to self-defense?</p>
<p>These are not small matters.  And you also better figure out that the US is on the cusp of a SECOND civil war over this stuff.  Specifically, you better figure out which side is really your side (do you really stand behind the stars and stripes when the stars and stripes means Obama and no whites allowed).  You better figure out if you live on the right side of any new borders that spring up.</p>

<p>I live in the little Persia area of Los Angeles.  I am pretty much surrounded by them.  I think there are more Persians than American Whites in the area.</p>
<p>A couple years ago a Perisan neighbor came over and asked what was this flag and why was it so popular?  He owned a store in a tourist entertainment area that sold flags of all sizes and clothes with flag designs.</p>
<p>The flag he showed me was the Confederate Battle Flag, red with the blue X.  He wanted to know why it was so popular.  It seemed that he had a hard time keeping in stock.  Many of his customers are tourists from Asia, Australia and Europe.</p>
<p>I told him what it was.  He likes it, because it is his best seller.  The foreigners probably like it because of the universal popular color scheme and the X in the middle, Xs and slanting lines being more pleasing than straight lines.</p>

		<p>      The Confederate flag for the most part never came up during the Vietnam era . While students from the northeast, a few mid-western states and the west coast were burning their draft cards, Old Glory, destroying their campuses and private property in nearby towns, brandishing NVA and VC flags, Southerners (even young ones), who were just as much against the Vietnam War as others, were steadfastly against travesties such as these . On national holidays the American flag flew in abundance on the squares and streets of all southern towns . When drafted, they served, fleeing to Canada was out of the question .</p>
<p>      Nearly all attacks on the Confederate flag can be traced to Kweisi Mfume&rsquo;s ascension to leadership of the NAACP . Up till then, the Confederate flag almost never came up . The NAACP at that time was consumed in corruption, misappropriation of funds etc. and was losing members faster than a dead dog loses fleas .  Mfume saved it by reviving the civil rights movement and giving it&rsquo;s constituents a common enemy to hate   &mdash;    &mdash;   whites in general, white southerners in particular . </p>
<p>    In &#8216;68 and again in &#8216;72, black Olympians were slamming and denigrating the American flag not the Confederate . Although they lie and deny it now . As a people they&rsquo;ve updated their program and have successfully divided southern and northern whites . Do you honestly believe that Bobby Seale and  Huey Newton proudly flew the American flag in their Panther headquarters in L.A. in the sixties ? Then let me make you the deal of the century on the Talmadge Bridge . You know the one on &#8220;Gator&#8221; where Jack Weston said to Burt Reynolds,&#8221; Gator, Bama   &mdash;  - don&rsquo;t you people have normal names ?&#8221; And Burt replied, &#8221; Oh you mean intelligent names like &#8220;Yogi&#8221; .&#8221; </p>
<p>     For those whites who have bought into the revived civil rights movement, and apparently there are a lot of them, I am reminded of the story of the beautiful swan who flew with the crows . Eventually shot by the farmer and as he lay dying he asked the farmer, &#8221; Why did you shoot me, I am not a crow?&#8221; And the farmer replied, &#8221; You hang out with the crows, you fly with the crows   &mdash;  - you must be a crow .&#8221;</p>

<p>Off the subject, if the Chinese really take over the UC system as Bon thinks might happen, the first thing they will do is abolish all those sexual and ethnic grievance groups and the entire liberal arts campus.</p>
<p>I also edit medical research papers for the asian Drs and PHDs who feel more comfortable having a native speaker edit the English.</p>
<p>I live the stars and bars.</p>
<p>I think I know what motivates Lindsay.  She is probably a senior majoring in feminist falsehoods, frauds and fantasies. Being a brainwashed liberal zombie, she went to college to &#8220;make a difference.&#8221;   She now realizes that her diploma is nothing but a piece of paper representing at least $100,000 mispent dollars.</p>
<p>There is nothing she can do with that piece of paper but go to law school, another 4 years and $200,000. Getting into a tier 1 or 2 law school and a scholarship will not be easy because she will have to check the White box on her application.</p>
<p>By posting on amren and printing out the articles and posts she is hoping to parlay her bigotry and bias into a $20,000 per year job with an anti White liberal organization.</p>
<p>If her parents are willing, she could do an unpaid internship with SPLC or ADL spraying graffitti on Jewish cemetery walls to prep the faithful for the annual fund raising drive.</p>
