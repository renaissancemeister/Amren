<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45100121/ns/world_news-africa/#.TrA-zPSa9tO">Suicide Bomber in Somali Attack Was Reportedly from Minneapolis</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, October 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man who blew himself up in an attack in the Somali capital on Saturday reportedly grew up in Minneapolis and was known by the FBI as one of 20 Somali Americans to have joined an al-Qaida-linked militant group.</p>
<p>Abdisalan Hussein Ali, 22, was suspected of being a member of al-Shabab, the FBI told msnbc.com.</p>
<p>Kyle Loven, the FBI&rsquo;s chief division counsel for Minneapolis, said Ali was a subject of &#8220;Operation Rhino,&#8221; an ongoing investigation into Somali youth traveling from the U.S. to Somalia to fight for al-Shabab.</p>
<p>Loven could not confirm whether Ali was indeed the bomber but told msnbc.com that the FBI was &#8220;awaiting results from DNA checks at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Al-Shabab posted an audiotape that they said was made by Ali before he blew himself up during an attack Saturday on an African Union base in Mogadishu that left at least 10 people dead.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the tape, the young man, who would be at least the fourth American to become a suicide bomber in Somalia, urges other young people to not &#8220;just chill all day&#8221; and instead fight nonbelievers around the world.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to The Minneapolis Star Tribune, he graduated from Edison High School and attended the University of Minnesota, where he was a pre-med student, The Times reported. He disappeared in 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The young man in the tape had an American accent and mixed Muslim terminology with American slang as he urged Muslims to carry out attacks against non-Muslims around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brothers and sisters, do jihad in America, do jihad in Canada, do jihad in England, anywhere in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in China, in Australia,&#8221; the voice on the al-Shabab tape said. &#8220;Anywhere you find (unbelievers), fight them and be firm against them.</p>

		<p>One thing to say in defense of dropping JDAMS on &#8220;US citizens&#8221; is that the founding fathers, when declaring religious freedom, never anticipated that a religious group in our country would become and organized conspiracy bent on destroying our civilization.</p>

<p>Sometime probably within the next couple of years these jihadists will blow something up here.  The experts agree it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>After the act occurs, the MSM will be urging everyone to not hold &#8220;all Muslims responsible for the acts of a few.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be something if another attack occurred right after they said that?  And then another?</p>
<p>Far fetched, but possible.  </p>
<p>But not far-fetched is believing that the media will be urging the same restraint in condemning all Muslims after each attack.</p>

		<p>We bring these people here, set them up with jobs, give them welfare and places to live, then the first chance they get they go home and blow themselves up.  This country is certifiably insane.  </p>

		<p>The USA opporates a Terrorist Training Program.  Here is how it works.  Speical Americans scour the Third World, searching for the most, primative, ignorant, angry, violent people.  Most important is that they come from cultures, religions, and values  diametrically opposite to those in the USA.</p>
<p>Then, at considerable taxpayer expense, these violent alien people are brought to the USA and provided with food, housing, medical care, education, transportation, cultural centers, etc.  Once they gain a USA passport and learn English and how our system works, then they are free to attack us anywhere in the world.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our government   &mdash;   working 24/7 to harm USA citizens and destroy America.</p>

		<p>While visiting Minneapolis in June, I tried to access AMREN from a courtesy computer in the lobby of my hotel. The site was blocked as a &#8220;hate group.&#8221;</p>
<p>From time to time Minneapolis shows up in the news, the mini-riot along Nicorette Mall and now this. I always think of that hotel when I see an article about their fine city, and wish them a nice day.</p>

<p> Sounds like your everyday, &#8220;moderate, and westernized&rdquo; Muslim, which the powers that be continue to insist will bring diversity and richness to our country. We&rsquo;ve gone insane&hellip;.  </p>

<p>Eric, with all due respect:</p>
<p>WE did not bring unwelcome Somalis here.  Neither I nor the American people were asked if we wanted illiterate, backwards Somalis brought into our cities and neighborhoods to drain the welfare system, stress medical facilities, receive Section 8 housing, free educations for their eight children and handed job preferences over us.</p>
<p>We are not insane.  The government is not insane.  It knows EXACTLY what it is doing which is this:   carrying out a designed plan to eliminate white Americans so other ethnic groups can feel safe.</p>
