<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2061869/Maasai-warriors-try-abduct-schoolgirls.html">Maasai Warriors Break into All-Girls School to Find Themselves a Wife</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Hatcher, Daily Mail (London), November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Maasai warriors have resorted to attacking an all-girls&rsquo; school in a desperate bid to find themselves wives.</p>
<p>The young men from Kenya&rsquo;s most iconic tribe attempted to abduct pupils from the Enkare Nairowua school, in Narok, after bursting in to the dining room at lunchtime.</p>
<p>Many of the girls fled to hide in nearby bushes until the Maasai  &mdash;  also known as morans  &mdash;  were persuaded to leave after two hours of negotiations with teachers, elders and a local chief.</p>
<p>However, they have threatened to return if they are not found brides.</p>
<p>The school principal, Sylvia Lelei, says the girls are living in fear and she has been forced to hire more guards to beef up security in the school</p>
<p>&#8216;I have never seen anything like this. Now parents are forced to foot the bill of more guards,&rsquo; she told local newspaper The Nation.</p>
<p>Police in the area have issued warnings, while locals have expressed outrage that no legal action has been taken so far.</p>
<p>Narok is close to Kenya&rsquo;s famous Maasai Mara game reserve, where the usually peaceful pastoralists tend to herds of cattle alongside some of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful wildlife.</p>
<p>According to tradition, young men from the Maasai tribe live together in traditional huts, or manyattas, until they are deemed ready to marry.</p>
<p>But girls in Kenya are increasingly resisting the pressure to marry at an early age as they now have better access to education and employment.</p>
<p>The change has caused huge tension in the Maasai tribe where young men are increasingly disaffected.</p>
<p>Locals said that this was not an isolated incident. The young men running amok in Narok stand accused of disrupting trade in local towns, assaulting residents and interfering with roadworks. </p>
<p>The local District Commissioner, Chimwaga Mongo, explained that the young men were acting under the guise of a rite of passage.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Nation, he said: &#8216;This is not true moranism. The difference between moranism of old and today&rsquo;s is that elders used to have strict control, and even the warriors themselves had a code of conduct&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The incident has caused consternation amongst some of Kenya&rsquo;s social commentators, who believe the young warriors have become a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>&#8216;Maasai culture has no room for abduction&#8221;, said Henry ole Kulet, a well-known novelist said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Girls were given out by elders through negotiated engagement. Where culture has failed, the law out to take its course.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I would say this is the direct, predictable and inevitable result of giving preferential economic and educational treatment to girls in traditional societies (i.e. every feministÂ´s moist dream). Disruption of society as an end unto itself (i.e. cultural Marxism) is not something I am going to underwrite.</p>
<p>- Well, at least no one was hurt this time. But expect much worse from Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and other parts of Africa.<br>
Is it not way over time to declare NOW and their ilk terrorist organizations?</p>

<p>&#8220;A group of Maasai warriors have resorted to attacking an all-girls&rsquo; school in a desperate bid to find themselves wives.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Considering no subsaharan males have ever shown much interest in marriage or monogamy, the use of the word &#8220;wives&#8221; here is surely a euphemism. By &#8220;wives&#8221; I assume they mean &#8220;reliable, on-demand booty-calls.&#8221; </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it for the Republic of Kenya, ladies and gentlemen, the &#8220;country&#8221; that brought you Barack Obama! A big round of applause if you will!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s called Wife Theft and was common practice among Whites of all faiths in the Balkans until the early 19th century and persists today in the Caucasus, among Turkic peoples, Arabs and Berbers and among pure-blooded Mongoloid steppe-dwellers &amp; mountaineers. Sparsely populated areas breed the phenomenon.</p>

		<p>I have little to comment on about such barbarism. Africans never fail to reach farther into the depths of depravity. But all this talk of &#8220;Morans&#8221; and &#8220;Moranism&#8221; reminds me of a delightful date I once had with a young Lithuanian nanny in the summer of 2001. </p>
<p>Her name was Asta and she was quite beautiful. Sometimes I felt like the troll that had carried off a princess, but back to the story. We were enjoying an open-air music festival with hundreds of other White revelers. There was some drinking, etc, but as usual with large gatherings of our folk there were no problems. <br>
We were sitting on bleachers talking and enjoying each other&rsquo;s company when a drunken guy came staggering by wearing a &#8220;Morans Irish Whiskey&#8221; shirt. Asta looked him over and asked me &#8220;Isn&rsquo;t &#8216;moran&rsquo; a bad word?&#8221; &#8220;I think you mean &#8216;moron&rsquo;!&#8221; This became an inside joke and for the remainder of the summer we referred to less than smart people as &#8216;morans&rsquo;. </p>
<p>We were really getting to know each other when 09/11 happened. She had to renew her visa at the beginning of 2002, but her application was refused and she was sent back to Lithuania. At the time I was too ignorant to think of proposing and applying for a fiance visa. She returned home and I never saw her again. I guess the morons who approve visa applications would prefe a low-IQ Masai warrior bride hunter to a 5&rsquo;2&#8221; Baltic girl with blue-green eyes and long blonde hair. </p>

<p>Do they indulge in the African version of the &#8220;Down Low&#8221; in those huts?<br>
The Bantu ( ZULU) warriors were not permitted to engage in sexual activity with women until they had washed their assegais in blood while in combat. That perhaps is why the Impi fought so furiously.</p>

<p>Hilarious.  The truth is almost all lion hunters are white.  And handguns are not a tool for hunting anything.  The tool of choice is a rifle chambered for the .338 Lampua Magnum although ignorant African authorities often demand a much larger round be used (and are mostly ignored).  I highly doubt Obama could pronounce Lampua Magnum let alone know what it is for.</p>
<p>A spear is an unlikely weapon to kill a lion with.  I highly doubt ANY blacks anywhere at any time in history hunted lions with spears.  A lion is not a boar, lol.  Lions are AGILE and would easily kill 5 morons (excuse me, morans) hunting it with spears.</p>
<p>Now a modern day compound bow or better yet, a crossbow&hellip;.yeah.  Dangerous but a skilled hunter could reliably and safely take down a lion with these.</p>
<p>Africans, especially today, are not able to fend for themselves.  They don&rsquo;t hunt and never did.  They don&rsquo;t farm, and never did.  They never built cities or even had a written language.  They basically live off what they could pick up off the ground and feared every predator (ever wonder why Kenyans are so good at running?)  The white man civilized Africa and continues to keep it safe for the black man.</p>
<p>5 Masai with spears hunting lions&hellip;..hilarious.  I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on them if they were using the best modern day weapons.  In fact, if I took 5 random white people off the streets of America and sent them to this task, they would soon reinvent the pit trap and have a dead lion at the bottom&hellip;.something no African ever did before whites taught them how.</p>

<p>I doubt that.  Before whites showed up, Masai never hunted animals, they followed herd animals on their migratory routes.  These were herd animals that Europeans were confining in fences and gates for a very long time.  The Masai only started in on animal husbandry when whites showed them how.  Also, that&rsquo;s when they started wearing clothes with regularity.</p>
<p>That said, it is highly unlikely that the Masai had any interest in actually hunting social predators like lions.</p>

<p>Of course they could.  </p>
<p>Killing a lion or any other animal with a large spear is not as hard as you think.  You can find videos online of Africans killing elephants and hippos with them.  There have been plenty of lions killed with spears over the years.  </p>
<p>The Massai are an ultra-tradional culture.  They don&rsquo;t have &#8220;booty calls.&#8221;  A man either has sex with his wife or with no one at all.  That&rsquo;s why these young men are so desperate.</p>
<p>Africans made traps and snares to catch animals far back in pre-history.</p>
<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t as primitive or stupid as some of the people here seem to think.  They learned farming and acquired domesticated animals through cultural diffusion long before Europeans came to sub-Saharan Africa.  They used iron tools and made wood furniture for their simple houses.  If you want to learn about a really primitive culture, research what Australian Aborigines were like when Europeans first encountered them.  </p>

		<p>Anon 9:17 and 9:23 are ridiculously ignorant individuals. To claim that Africans never hunted or farmed is laughable, at best. Black people were actually just fine when left to their own devices, insofar as they had adapted to their environment and expressed themselves according to their abilities. It was only when white colonialists tried to convince them to become Christians and live like modern Westerners that serious dysfunction began. At this point, many Africans are practically helpless, and need continuous financial aid just to maintain a semblance of Western Civilization. Better that they should be left to their own devices and let the chips fall where they may. But to say that rudimentary agriculture and pastoralism was unknown is flat out false. And video exists on Youtube showing 3 African pastoralists chasing a pride of lions off of a kill, so as to feed themselves. It is stunning footage, and I know how to give respect where respect is due. And those warriors earned my respect, regardless of their color.<br>
Considering Amren moderates comments, I&rsquo;m not sure why letting blatantly false and ridiculous nonsense to be posted is seen as necessary. It just makes an otherwise fine site seem low brow and ignorant. </p>

Sparsely populated areas breed the phenomenon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually &#8220;bride kidnapping&#8221; (or marriage by abduction) has been practiced throughout the world at various times in history in both sparsely and fairly populated areas.  White nationalist rhetoric aside for a moment, it has been so prevalent among humans many scientists believe it was an evolutionary strategy adopted early in the history of our species to insure survival of male genes.</p>
<p>Western legends speak of it like the carrying off of Helen of Troy by Paris or the Rape of the Sabine Women by Roman men.  It&rsquo;s also mentioned in the Bible.  Bride abduction was such a problem in the old Roman Empire that Constantine the Great felt compelled to outlaw it by edict.</p>
<p><a href="https://children-laws.laws.com/child-abduction/bride-kidnapping/bride-kidnapping-history" rel="nofollow">https://children-laws.laws.com/child-abduction/bride-kidnapping/bride-kidnapping-history</a></p>
<p>Northern Europe did not escape this phenomenon, either.  Bride abductions were still practiced in Ireland until the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/60y/chapter3.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/60y/chapter3.htm</a></p>
<p>Benign echoes of it survive in the custom of the &#8220;best man&#8221; who originally helped the groom-to-be actually kidnap his heart&rsquo;s desire, then had to guard the bride from being rescued by her family.  Whispers of it also survive in the ribald German wedding tradition called, appropriately enough:</p>
<p>https://www.cultureledger.com/kidnapping-of-the-bride-german-wedding-tradition/</p>
<p>Of course, modern Westerners (i.e. White people), being a civilized lot, are much more sensitive to the needs and desires of women, and so have proscribed the practice as inhumane.  It&rsquo;s therefore no surprise that black Africans, being primitive and inferior, would continue the practice.</p>

I read the article. How much evidence do we need before we conclude that these bipeds are something less than fully human?</p>
<p>&#8220;The deputy principal, Joyce Kithira, was quoted by the paper as having told President Daniel arap Moi when he visited the destroyed dormitory: &#8220;The boys never meant any harm against the girls. They just wanted to rape.&#8221;<br>
 This from a female pongid posing as a human woman!!!!!!</p>
<p>The male pongid principal described the act of gang rape as the boys just &#8220;doing their thing&#8221; and that it&rsquo;s be all forgotten the next day<br>
Maybe those poor boys were just trying to &#8220;turn their lives around&#8221; and no better way to do it than a mass gang rape of scared school girls.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a page from Black Panther Mr. Shabazz and stand on a street corner and call for the killing of &#8221; Mau Maus and their little babies&#8221; <br>
That&rsquo;d certainly get a rise out of our POS Attorney General Holder. We be in jail before the press got there.</p>
<p>If I had a time machine I&rsquo;d be back in 1861 selling .50 Calibre machine guns to the Confederacy.</p>

 That&rsquo;s poor N&rsquo;gumbo who was tripped in front of the lion. ROTFL<br>
I certainly pity the Masai for history has passed them by. They can&rsquo;t fight progress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kenyans Do Some Soul-Searching After the Rape of 71 Schoolgirls&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But one night this month 71 teen-age schoolgirls were raped by male students and 19 others died in a night of dormitory violence that reportedly began with a protest over fees and then ran on unchecked by the local police or teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/EjQtB" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/EjQtB</a></p>
<p>If masses of African students were brought to our own White countries they would never do such a thing, since our coed dormitories and bathrooms would enable them to better know and understand and have empathy for the opposite sex. &#8220;Kumbaya&#8221; is an African word after all.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;d shouldered our responsibilities and brought those boys here to study, those girls would have been spared their night of horror.</p>
<p>There is so much work still to be done before we anti-Whites complete our program of White Genocide.</p>

<p>Actually there are YouTube videos of Massai hunting a lioness. The video is followed by a barrage of comments from self loathing White people for having killed so many lions. One pendejo declared that he/she hates himself for being White.  I think that it was abominable as well but it was also White people who started the protection programs for these animals as well as other endangered species.  Let&rsquo;s no forget that the Lakota people used to run entire herds of Bison over a cliff which is hardly good conservation techniques although I recognize that Whites came close to exterminating the entire Bison population.  In India if someone is attacked by a Tiger the villagers go out and kill every cat that they can find. THe Japanese are still killing Whales wholesale, the Chinese think that bear liver is good for them. White people always seem to get the bad publicity. </p>

		<p>I have read several times where it is a right of passage for a Masai warrior (or warrior-to-be as the case may be), to go out and kill a lion using only a spear. I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;ll be able to find any stats as to how many are successful or how many end up as lunch for a pride, but they do it. <br>
I&rsquo;m still trying to get my head around a bunch of them showing up at an all white school hoping to drag off a few white girls. Were they actually serious? Has there ever been a case where a white woman willingly went off to cohabitate with a Masai warrior in some hut in a far off village? Now there&rsquo;s a book waiting to be written. </p>

<p>From your comment, somebody may conclude that white people are the main reason why most of the world&rsquo;s exotic wildlife has gone extinct. Many leftist environmentalists say that whites caused extinction of wildlife, everywhere they settled.</p>
<p>I am opposed to lion hunting, as well as the hunting of other endangered species, such as tigers, pandas, pumas, etc. The whites we should be celebrating, are the whites who are working to preserve exotic species, and not the whites who are hunting those species to extinction.</p>

		<p>Anonymous wrote at 9:17 PM on November 17: and 11  &mdash;  Caleo wrote at 10:47 PM are right and wrong.   Before the European settlers arrived and soon became white Africans,  the locals could not read other than animal tracks; did not build with bricks or stones; only huts of wood and mud; as the practiced subsistence farming where when the land was finished; they moved on elsewhere and that is why they ended up having short life spans until the whites introduced European methods of advance farming and building showing them how to make bricks etc.  Even today as proven in South Africa and Zimbabwe they are pretty incapable of practicing modern methods and are consequently in Zim (and to a lesser degree in SA where there are still mainly white farmers) where the farms are being stolen by the winner takes all by the former terrorists from the white Africans, many have and are still starving to death.  When Mugabe dies look out for the African begging bowls to come out for millions from the West who will give generously s they Africans will turn to the Chinese who are looking to expand their population elsewhere in the World; that is to colonise and build a World empire.   For a typical SA disaster Google Zebedelia Fruit Farm South Africa.</p>

		<p>This is the type of people that the leftists are importing into white countries.  These third worlders are raping and hurting white women with the full support of the leftists.  </p>
<p>Black &#8220;immigrants&#8221; in Scandinavia have a history of mutilating their rape victim.  One poor girl had her ears cut off by third world blacks who had gang raped her.  They were let into the country by leftists.</p>
<p>Anyone who supports third world immigration into white countries is responsible for every crime they commit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found the footage. Just go to Youtube and put 3 men vs. 15 lions into the search engine. The footage is stunning. And I&rsquo;d like to see 3 random white Americans, or black Americans for that matter, try and do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you suppose after 1000 years of living the same way whites wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do the same thing?  Please. I&rsquo;d like to see 3 random Morans invent anything useful such as powered flight, or anything technological for that matter.  The only reason we are having this pitiful conversation about these Morans&rsquo; extraordinary feat is because their technology PEAKED with fashioning a sharpened object onto a wooden rod!  </p>

		<p>In her book &#8220;West With the Wind&#8221; (1935+-), Beryl Markham made an observation on the members of the Kavirondo tribe in western Kenya: &#8220;I counldn&rsquo;t help wondering what Africa would have been like if such physique as the Kavirondo had were coupled with equal intelligence- or perhaps I should say with cunning equal to that of their white brethren.&#8221; Nontheless, she had an obvious disdain for her own tribe.</p>
<p>The Kavirondo tribe (old desination) is now incorporated into what are called the Luo tribe.  If my quick search and free association are correct, it is the Luo tribe that Barack Obama&rsquo;s father belonged to.  </p>

		<p> They also practice female circumcision or mutilation, so the girls have no sexual desire left. They always leave that part out of the stories about African and Yemen and many other countries. </p>

What makes you think these were white girls? The article contains no indication that they were. A girls&rsquo; school in a black country in Africa will probably be full of black African girls. </p>

		<p>What a shame, when I was in Africa twenty years ago the Masai were still in their tribal unit and wore native clothes. They were kind, restrained and even modest. They had no relation to the urbanized Blacks we think of in America or Africa. They maybe represent what Blacks may have been like had we left them alone. It hurt both our races.</p>
