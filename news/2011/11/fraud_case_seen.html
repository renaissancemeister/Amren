			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Benedict Carey, New York Times, November 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A well-known psychologist in the Netherlands whose work has been published widely in professional journals falsified data and made up entire experiments, an investigating committee has found. Experts say the case exposes deep flaws in the way science is done in a field, psychology, that has only recently earned a fragile respectability.</p>
<p>The psychologist, Diederik Stapel, of Tilburg University, committed academic fraud in &#8220;several dozen&#8221; published papers, many accepted in respected journals and reported in the news media, according to a report released on Monday by the three Dutch institutions where he has worked: the University of Groningen, the University of Amsterdam, and Tilburg. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In recent years, psychologists have reported a raft of findings on race biases, brain imaging and even extrasensory perception that have not stood up to scrutiny. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a prolific career, Dr. Stapel published papers on the effect of power on hypocrisy, on racial stereotyping and on how advertisements affect how people view themselves. {snip}</p>
<p>In a statement posted Monday on Tilburg University&rsquo;s Web site, Dr. Stapel apologized to his colleagues. &#8220;I have failed as a scientist and researcher,&#8221; it read, in part. &#8220;I feel ashamed for it and have great regret.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Dr. Stapel has published about 150 papers, many of which, like the advertising study, seem devised to make a splash in the media. The study published in Science this year claimed that white people became more likely to &#8220;stereotype and discriminate&#8221; against black people when they were in a messy environment, versus an organized one. {snip}</p>

		<p>A question for psychologists to answer: why do so many whites hate their race, and by extension, themselves?  Of course an economic based explanation for his behavior would be that in the current academic environment it is a sure winner, both professionally and financially, to produce anti-white material.  So for this man it may only be a case of simple opportunism.  I suspect, though, that it is a mixture of both self-loathing and opportunism.  If so, the man is doubly miserable, both psychologically and morally.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure that millions of people hear millions of love songs and see millions of images of happy people every single day.  And never once, no not once, has a song ever made someone fall in love or an image made someone happy.  Sounds, images and words just don&rsquo;t have the magic powers people proscribe to them.  How I wish they did - I&rsquo;d hold up a big sign that read &#8220;PEACE&#8221; and we&rsquo;d all sleep easier that night.</p>
<p>The magical view of sounds, images and words is especially strong when they are &#8216;racist.&rsquo;  Whatever that means, it&rsquo;s bad, and whoever is around those magical spells is bad or made bad by them.  Except in the real world, that&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>

		<p>The practice of producing fraudulent studies by &#8220;progressives&#8221; has been widespread for decades.</p>
<p>Margaret Mead, who wrote the book, COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA, was found in later years to have falsified data in her studies.</p>
<p>The above mentioned book was required reading by generations of college students.</p>
<p>Mead was a favorite student of Franz Boaz, a leading light in the progressive movement.</p>
<p>If memory serves, Franz Boaz was also a member of the Frankfurt School which produced some of the leading &#8220;academics&#8221; responsible for the ongoing deconstruction of Western civilization. The guiding principal of these fruads is, and always has been, &#8220;THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS&#8221;. </p>
<p>And so, for them, to imagine results and publish lies is just fine if it advances their cause. </p>

		<p>In many academic departments worldwide, progressives are like an occupying army that can spread its ideology through splashy &#8220;research&#8221; that serves as confirmation of their political objectives. The peer review standards have declined as the peers become a monochrome of thought within each discipline, hence the loss of trust in research outcomes. Research regarding racial differences is case in point, where psychologists strain to find no significant differences between groups despite hard data that says otherwise. When Arthur Jensen elaborated on the obvious with hard data about racial differences, the academic community went into an uproar and ostracized him permanently. Others daring to challenge liberal orthodoxy have met the same fate. One can even consider the falsification of data by climatologists bent on &#8220;proving&#8221; man-made global warming due to CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere. What boredom must come from analyzing precipitation patterns or the effects of ocean currents when you can save the world and be a celebrity scientist? The decline in our public schools is matched by the decline in our universities and the research they publish. There are exceptions such as in engineering, chemistry and medicine, but psychology pumps out a steady stream of politically correct junk science paid for by the taxpayers.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a great advantage to be able to label your political opponents as not just wrong but sick and defective. Political dissidents in the Soviet Union were sentenced to lifetimes of torture in state-fun &#8220;mental hospitals&#8221; only because liars in academia passed off lies as scientific research. </p>
<p>Any academic fraud is a profound abuse of the entire society, an offense against truth per se. The left has always been eager to control education because they can do the most damage from there.</p>

		<p>The absolute dominance of the Cultural-Marxist ideology in academia dictates that research topics are severely restricted and conclusions are preordained. Orthodoxy is enforced with a zeal that would bring an evil smile to the face of &#8220;Uncle Joe.&#8221; Many graduate schools conduct special &#8220;orientation&#8221; programs to identify and eject dissidents prophylactically. As for research, &#8220;Ethics Committees&#8221; (i.e., commissars) quash any attempt at honestly or even-handedness. A sharp, young social scientist could make a brilliant career out of busting fudged and fraudulent research findings. Such an individual would be an outlaw at first but the tide is inexorably turning and would land on his feet up the line. Volunteers&hellip;please take one giant-step forward!   </p>

		<p>In all fairness, Margaret Mead was a young and very gullible Utopian who swallowed her informants&rsquo; fairy tales unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>The delectable tale of all the fun of guilt-free and happy sex hit the USA at a time when labor unrest in the North, racial tension in the South, the rise of the K among the unlettered, the rise of the Communist Party among the unlettered and her book exploded like a grenade among the 5% of the public with working brains.</p>
<p>Dear readers, dig out a copy of COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA and delight in it.</p>

<p>That is exactly how 2, just 2 anti White researchers came up with the out of africa theory which is being disproved every day, for instance read the post about the discovery of a 40,000 year old White person&rsquo;s skeleton in England.</p>
<p>Out of africa claims that all humans are descended from people who left africa 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. So how could there be the skeleton of a fully modern White person who lived 40,000 years ago exist?  For that matter, how could the skeleton of a fully modern asian who lived 750,000 years ago exist?</p>
<p>Answer, out of africa is as false as most psychology.</p>
<p>To understand how utterly false psychology and talk psychiatiry is, check out the so called professions views on gays.</p>
<p>For thousands of years different societies had different views on homosexuality.  No one ever thought that being gay was in and of itself a mental illness until the psych profession was born.</p>
<p>Around the psychs decided that homosexuality was a mental illness that could only be cured by life long sessions with an expensive psychiatrist. Homosexuality was classified as a mental illness in and of itself in every textbook and manual.</p>
<p>Then in 1968 the gays objected to being classified as mentally ill.  So the psychs obliged and removed homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses.</p>
<p>This is a science? Obviously not.</p>
<p>Psychiatrity is responsible for much of the soft on crime legislation.  For decades psychs blamed crime on childhood experiences.  By 1965 when black crime was out of control, they testified that black criminals were driven by racism.  Psychs had a lot to do with the to kill a mockingbird defense that caused tens of thousands of black on White rapists to go free.</p>
<p>Mental illness is very real. It can be cured.  It is caused by organic defects, like other disease.  There is medication to cure mental illness.  Talking to someone who wants to be a physician but would rather lounge in a comfy chair all day than be on his or her feet all day will not help.</p>

		<p>Given recent history of &#8220;scientific&#8221; hoaxes, it should be obvious that psychology is the least of the offenders. This fraud&rsquo;s writings were wrong but did little harm mainly because nobody paid much attention to them outside of academic circles.<br>
Compare this to the climate change frauds, who are costing us billions of dollars. And Algore isn&rsquo;t even a scientist. </p>

		<p>I think it is entirely fair to say that the vast majority of academic &#8220;product&#8221; is merely junk food for the mind (as always, we are speaking of the humanities, or sub humanities, to be exact). No, I don&rsquo;t have a study to prove that, but how would one go about doing so, anyway? Let&rsquo;s just say that for me, most academic books and papers are so tedious, or tendentious, or narrow, or poorly written, or frankly perverse, that a normal person would want nothing to do with them. </p>
<p>Most of the psychology journals I see are so dopey as to be laughable. And I mean that literally. (Let me say at the outset that there are a number of excellent psychoanalytic journals, but psychoanalysis is not exactly an academic discipline but a clinical one; it only becomes stupid in the hands of academics.) I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any of the big journals in my field. In fact, I&rsquo;m not even a member of my professional association, the American Psychological Association, because it&rsquo;s just a front for a totalitarian gang of leftist activists. But I do see some of the journals laying around the office, and I do occasionally flip through them for a laugh. To say that they are shallow does not even begin to address the problem. Virtually every issue has some big study about multiculturalism and the need for what is called cultural competence. </p>
<p>I just picked up one of these journals the other day, and read an article that was one of a multi-part series on cultural competence. This one had to do with cultural competence toward Muslim patients&hellip; wait, I mean clients&hellip; no, consumers of mental health services. (This shifting name for the object of clinical attention is another obnoxious artifact of the PC virus   &mdash;   as if we can make a sick person well by calling him a &#8220;consumer&#8221; instead of a &#8220;patient.&#8221;) Among other things, I learned that, in dealing with Muslims   &mdash;   especially Shia Muslims   &mdash;   one must be sensitive to their core value of martyrdom.</p>
<p>Now this is fascinating, because the idea is presented absolutely without irony or self-awareness. Yes, the PC impulse is a totalitarian one, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way to the person infected with it. Rather, I am sure they simply feel earnest. They are merely following their &#8220;do-gooder&#8221; impulse to provide me with the information I need to assist Muslim consumers of mental health services to be better martyrs. The idea that a cultural belief or practice can be a priori sick is unknown   &mdash;   even unthinkable   &mdash;   to them. </p>

		<p>Jonathan Haidt (a social psychologist himself) has made a major contribution calling attention to social psychology as a  &rdquo;tribal moral community&rdquo; united in its liberal political commitments. He notes that articles that contravene the tribal liberalism are subjected to much higher standards in order to get published. Even when it&rsquo;s not a matter of outright fraud, there are sins of omission where certain types of racial research are just not conducted. Recall that Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam did not publish his findings on the costs of multiculturalism for years because he thought it might sour people on our glorious multicultural future.</p>
<p>Here the NYTimes article adds that a recent study found that in an anonymous survey around 70% of psychologists admitted  &rdquo;cutting corners&rdquo; in reporting their data and 1% acknowledged falsification; statistical errors favoring  the hypothesis occurred in around 15% of a random sample of papers in high-end psychology journals.</p>
<p>I suppose that the long term effects of outright fraud in social psychology are less important than the lowered standards that apply when articles reaffirm liberal ideas in the social sciences. This was famously true of the Boasians in anthropology. It continues today since Boas&rsquo;s intellectual descendants are still in control. Boas was the quintessential skeptic and an ardent defender of methodological rigor when it came to theories of cultural evolution and genetic influences on behavior, yet, as Sheldon White noted, &ldquo;the burden of proof rested lightly upon Boas&rsquo;s own shoulders&rdquo;<br>

		<p>All soft sciences, and everything that came out of the Frankfurt school are not real science.  They use scientific terms but not scientific methodology.  They do not build on facts, the way that science does.  Instead, opinions on unobservable events and analogy are treated as fact and dissenting opinion is treated as heresy.  These opinions are not random but are, in fact, a conspiracy created by the Frankfurt school to try and change white people in order to weaken us to the point that we accept slavery and all sorts of unacceptable behaviors.</p>
<p>To say that fraud is a problem is psychological research is a gross distortion.  The entire field is fraudulent, except for some small part that overlaps with neuroscience (and I mean, very, very little is legitimate).  People treated in psychology, don&rsquo;t get better&hellip;..because there was nothing wrong with them that doesn&rsquo;t involve simple free will and choice.  Psychology has nothing to offer the neurologically compromised person and often causes lots of problems in trying to treat them.</p>
<p>I feel very comfortable making that statement with a masters of clinical psychology under my belt and years of experience attempting to treat people who are simply acting badly.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as depression or anxiety disorders (which are mostly drug use) and eating disorders are pure behavior choice.  None of these responds in any way to psychological &#8220;treatment&#8221; other than common sense (ie stop using drugs).  Schizophrenic people and related disorders, psychology has nothing of merit to say about those and less to offer as treatment.</p>
<p>All the rest written, spoken, studied in psychology is nothing more than thinly veiled anti-white bigotry and anti-Christian/atheist immorality.</p>
<p>The entire discipline should be banned.  No&hellip;the entire discipline should be deconstructed and every instance of intended harm, manipulation and degeneracy thoroughly studied with regard to whom specifically are doing what&hellip;..and those people punished and expelled from our society and the attempt taught to future generations as part of an attempt to guard against future assault.</p>
<p>As those same people have been, dozens of times in recorded history for the same reasons.</p>

		<p>To #15 Rebel Psychologist - I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, but I had a job at a university where I worked with many sociologists and with students who were sociology or psychology majors. I was a biology major, by the way. Anyway, one day I was in the break room and happened to pick up some sociology magazine/journal and there was an article on how Blacks are subject to &#8220;weathering,&#8221; sort of like an old barn or old house. All of this &#8220;weathering&#8221; from White racism causes them much distress and that&rsquo;s why they aren&rsquo;t able to achieve as much as Whites. </p>
<p>No wonder you&rsquo;re a Rebel Psychologist. <br>

<p>One may be able to &#8220;&hellip;delight in it&#8221; if one reads COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA, but my point is that the book should not have been offered as scientific research. It should have been classified as fiction, which it is. </p>
<p>Additionally, your point about the youth and gullibility of Ms Mead is taken, but again, she should not have been treated as a serious scientist given those qualities.</p>
<p>Her book was used because the contents fit the narrative of the progressives. They cared not about whether the contents of the book were accurate. For shame.<br>

		<p><i>All soft sciences, and everything that came out of the Frankfurt school are not real science. They use scientific terms but not scientific methodology.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Anon #20</p>
<p>Yes.  Excellent comment.  The Frankfurt school caused tremendous damage to White American culture, as did Boas with his rejection of Darwinism and Margaret Mead with her attacks on traditional White American families.  All were frauds and we are battling them to this day.  Add Freud as well.</p>
<p><i>The Nazis perceived the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research as a communist organization and closed it within six weeks of Hitler&rsquo;s ascent to power because it had &#8216;encouraged activities hostile to the state.&rsquo;</i>  The Institute relocated to the United States where it carried on its marxist rantings.</p>
<p>But, you can give Boas credit for the entrenched, odious dogma &#8220;Race is a Social Construct!&#8221;  From his position of power at Columbia, he suppressed racial data, outright rejected any notion of racial differences in IQ and opposed research on human genetics.  Anyone who stated otherwise (i.e., Madison Grant) was denounced and ostracized.</p>
<p>Boaz&rsquo;s critics rightly claim:  &#8220;He made conjectures in a very dogmatic manner, his historical reconstructions are inferences, guesses, and unsupported assertions [ranging] from the possible to the preposterous. Almost none is verifiable.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of that mattered because his teachings were politicized and used to deconstruct and destroy White American culture.  Boaz praised Third World cultures as &#8220;free of war and homicide, peaceful and unconcerned with the accumulation of wealth&#8221; while White American culture was undermined and degraded, told it should emulate these more primitive societies.  Boaz was wrong, of course, and a liar as well.</p>
<p><i>By 1926 every major department of anthropology was headed by Boas&rsquo;s students</i></p>
<p>These disciples of Boas were responsible for disseminating Boas&rsquo;s theories and promoting Margaret Mead&rsquo;s <i>Coming of Age in Samoa</i> throughout higher education; apparently this is STILL going on in some universities, even though Mead&rsquo;s book and Boas&rsquo;s theories have been throughly refuted, denounced and shown to be complete frauds.</p>
<p>Margaret Mead, like Boas, had a political agenda to destroy White American families which she sneeringly called &#8220;bourgeois, tiny and ingrown&#8221;, writing that families &#8220;cripple emotional life, and warp and confuse the growth of individuals&rsquo; power to consciously live their own lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>ANYONE who still believes &#8220;Race is a Social Construct&#8221;, &#8220;One Culture is Interchangeable with Another&#8221;, &#8220;There is No Such Thing as IQ&#8221; or &#8220;White Culture is a Cancer on the Earth&#8221; deserves to be ridiculed, denounced, mocked and debased   &mdash;   just as the lefties do to us.  These things are put forth to deny legitimacy to White Americans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s far past time to expose these frauds for what they are:  Pro White Genocidists.</p>

		<p>{snip}The scandal, involving about a decade of work, is the latest in a string of embarrassments in a field that critics and statisticians say badly needs to overhaul how it treats research results. In recent years, psychologists have reported a raft of findings on race biases, brain imaging and even extrasensory perception that have not stood up to scrutiny. Outright fraud may be rare, these experts say, but they contend that Dr. Stapel took advantage of a system that allows researchers to operate in near secrecy and massage data to find what they want to find, without much fear of being challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big problem is that the culture is such that researchers spin their work in a way that tells a prettier story than what they really found,&rdquo; said Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like everyone is on steroids, and to compete you have to take steroids as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a prolific career, Dr. Stapel published papers on the effect of power on hypocrisy, on racial stereotyping and on how advertisements affect how people view themselves. Many of his findings appeared in newspapers around the world, including The New York Times, which reported in December on his study about advertising and identity.{Snip}</p>
<p>what are the names and publishing dates of the fraudulent papers?<br>
we must find and expose them!</p>

		<p>Re 06</p>
<p>As a scientifically guided approach to human conduct, psychology can hardly justify ignoring the evidence from myths, history, literature,f olklore etc.  But it manages to do so.  Notions of general Black intellectual inferiority arose over time in agrarian America from observations at the motor-performance level of semi-skilled, skilled- and unskilled labor  Our ancestors were far more hostile toward (not without reason, BTW ) Indians than toward blacks, but Indians were never consensually seen as mentally slow. Blacks, sadly, were chattel property and the consensus they were mentally dull was hardly a property enhancement.    Overseers existed not mainly to whip productivity from them but to look out for them  &mdash;  for the property interests of their owner-masters within the physically dangerous labors of agrarian America.  And yet none of this is relevant to contemporary psychologists purporting to shed light on Black/White intellectual differences??  A profession cut asunder!!</p>

<p>Lanfus is absolutely right.  Prozac, despite the bad press it receives from the bogus, fraudulent talk psychiatrists who still practice Dr Sigmund Fraud&rsquo;s idiocy, works because it builds up the serotonin levels in the brain</p>
<p>Just as antibiotics kill bacteria and infections and insulin regulates blood glucose levels, so prozac and related drugs<br>
cure depression by building serotonin levels up to normal.</p>
<p>Drugs cure diabetes, infections, and numerous other diseases including AIDS.  The AIDS drugs were developed in only 20 years.</p>
<p>Before Dr. Fraud came along, physicians considered mental diseases to be just that, diseases that could be cured eventually like all other diseases.  It would need research and drugs.</p>
<p>Dr. Fraud and his followers set back mental disease research for 100 years.</p>
<p>If AIDS, diabetes, rampant infections and TB can be cured with drugs, so depression can be cured with drugs that build serotonin up to normal levels.</p>
<p>Prozac and celexa cure depression the same way insulin cures diabetes.</p>
<p>No one was ever cured of depression by spending time talking to a bogus practicioner of talk therapy.<br>

<p>I always thought that was why Freud&rsquo;s theories got so popular so suddenly.  Of course there was the marxist ethnic agenda involved, but the main appeal of freud was sex, sex, sex, sex.</p>

		<p>The reason Sigmund Freud had his patients lay on a couch with him behind the patient was because Freud wrote his books while the patient rambled on.</p>
<p>Freud was paid double for his fraudulent books, first by the patients who supported him as he wrote, and second by the publisher and buyers.</p>
<p>Freud&rsquo;s entire theory of frigidity was based on one patient who he saw 4 times, &#8220;Dora&#8221;.  The theory of frigidity claimed that women were like animals at mating time, open to any ugly unwelcome creep who happened along.  Attraction, courtship, friendship were irrevelant.  Women should just do it with anyone who wanted it.  If a woman rejected some creep, she was frigid and abnormal and mentally ill.</p>
<p>This is the &#8220;Dora&#8221; on which he based his theory of fridigidity.</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s father, Herr B was the business partner of Herr A.  Herr B and Frau A had an adulterous love affair going.  Herr A was suspicious.  Herr B did not want a divorce because it would break up the business.  Frau A did not want a divorce because alimony and child custody were based on which party was more guilty.</p>
<p>Child custody would go to the innocent party.  Alimony would be based on adultery.  A man guilty of adultery would have to pay more than he could afford.  A woman guilty of adultery would lose custody of the children and get a subsistence alimony equal to welfare.</p>
<p>So Frau A and Herr B did not want a divorce.  Frau A and Herr B (Dora&rsquo;s father) decided to entangle Herr A with Dora who was 13 at the time. That way, Herr A would be equally guilty of adultery.  There would be no divorce.  Frau A would continue supported by her rich husband with lovers on the side.  Herr B could continue the prosperous business partnership.</p>
<p>Dora was the only one who objected.  What 13 year old virgin child would not object to being thrust into the bed of a middle aged unattractive man?  Herr A by the way, was all for this arrangement.</p>
<p>After a year of Herr B harassing his daughter to be Herr A&rsquo;s lover, Dora was sent to Dr. Freud to cure her &#8220;frigidity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dora was never raped by Herr A.  She way young and strong, he was fat and out of shape.  Dora saw Freud 4 times and refused to come back.  She sought refugee with a relative. Freud&rsquo;s followers wrote on and on about Dora calling her a &#8220;vicious hysteric&#8221; because she slapped him and ran away when Herr A grabbed her.</p>
<p>This was the case on which Freud and his followers based their entire theory of frigidity which was embraced by every leftist nerd who couldn&rsquo;t seduce a woman by normal means.</p>
<p>Generations of women had to listen to this garbage from creeps they would not touch with a 10 foot pole.</p>
<p>Given the Dora story, should we believe anything Freud wrote?</p>
<p>He had something unprintable to justify molestation of pre school girls by their fathers.  Something to do with dolls and daddy&rsquo;s anatomy.</p>
<p>Right up to the mid 1970&rsquo;s feminist movement, pschyoanylists thought it was perfectly acceptable to seduce their female patients to cure them of what ailed them. That was Freud&rsquo;s legacy.<br>

		<p>#26 Depression is basically a physical disorder caused by low serotonin levels in the brain.</p>
<p>And yet all treatments designed to adjust serotonin levels have a treatment effect of near zero.  One does not go to the doctor when experiencing &#8220;symptoms&#8221; of depression, have their serotonin levels measured and then medicate in order to bring them into a normal range, resulting in alleviation of symptoms.</p>
<p>What happens is, more likely than not, a person does drugs.  Marijuana is the most common.  And, they get more and more depressed.  Serotonin is theorized to be involved but is not an effective treatment point.  Placebos have much greater effect than drugs designed to effect serotonin.</p>
<p>What is effective? To convince the person that their drug habit is causing the problem and to stop.  I saw this pattern again and again and again working community mental health.</p>
<p>Depression outside of drug use is sometimes present but always you find one of two things.  The person has extreme negative life events (example&hellip;.divorce) or the person is being a jerk and experiencing rejection.  Neither responds to &#8220;therapy&#8221; in any way.  Instead, people feel better once they change their behavior to the extent they can change their situation.</p>
<p>Depression does not exist as a separate disease.  No psychological disorder does.  Where physical diseases have specific, concrete aspects you can identify and measure and, more importantly, respond to treatment.  Psychological disorders are vague, attempt to identify behaviors (and more likely than not fail to be useful and specific) and do not respond to treatment.</p>
<p>Someone comes in with a rash.  You put antibiotic ointment on it.  It goes away.  If I look closer, I might culture staph from little pustules forming on it.  That is a disease process.</p>
<p>Someone comes in &#8220;feeling crappy&#8221;.  They might be getting less sleep than usual (at least that is measurable).  It feels like they are moving through molasses to get anything done anymore.  They don&rsquo;t feel like going to their crappy job in the morning.  Giving them tricyclic anti-depressent does nothing except make their mouth dry.  Other drugs are equally ineffective.  A round of cognitive behavior therapy is worthless.</p>
<p>It comes out that the person is recently divorced.  After a normal period of mourning for their broken relationship, they meet someone new and their &#8220;symptoms&#8221; magically disappear.</p>
<p>That is NOT a disease process.  And quite frankly, the psychological view of what is going on is less than worthless.</p>
<p>Psychology, as a discipline has yet to meet the criteria of the disease model for a single thing supposedly in its bailiwick nor come up with anything even remotely effective for what it supposedly treats.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an accident.  It&rsquo;s by design.</p>

<p>That may happen in your criminal psych practice, but depression is caused by low serontin levels, not by illegal drug use.</p>

<p>It is obvious you deal with criminals on parole and court referrals who are compelled by court order to attend your CMHC.  That is a very, very different population from people who have never committed a crime or used illegal drugs.</p>
<p>There are psych jobs dealing with other than community mental health drug addict criminal patients.  If you talk to Drs and counselors who work with normal, nor criminal drug addict clients, you will find that low serontin levels, not drug addiction causes depression.</p>
<p>There is also situational depression.  When bad things happen and go on for a long time, serontin levels fall.  If the situation gets better, serontin levels go up without any psychotropic drugs such as xanax.</p>
<p>I am now working on a test of ritalin curing depression in the elderly.  We are about finished.  In the majority of test subjects, serontin levels went way up because of ritalin.</p>
<p>You work with criminal drug addicts.  Others work with normal people who are depressed because of low serontin levels.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to say that your clients did not turn to mood elevating drugs like marijuana and cocaine because they were depressed?</p>
<p>Every researcher from AA to medical Drs has concluded that deperssion causes alcoholism not the other way around.  The reason AA works so well is that it gives depressed people a suport system, friends, a massive ego lift because they conquered their addiction and the entire AA society to belong to .</p>

		<p>&#8220;Psychiatrity is responsible for much of the soft on crime legislation. For decades psychs blamed crime on childhood experiences. By 1965 when black crime was out of control, they testified that black criminals were driven by racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is something psychiatrists who call themselves expert witnesses do.  They are hired to sit in the courtroom as victims and witnesses of crime testify for the prosecution.  Later they testify for the defense that they are experts on body language and speech.  They testify that the prosecution witnesses did not really see what they saw.  Often it is the all blacks and hispanics look alike so the witness identification should be thrown out.</p>

<p>Oh, so true!  Of ALL of the frauds perpetuated on us, he was one of THE worst, if not THE absolute worst!  </p>
<p>Freud was nothing more than a dirty old man.</p>
<p>His theories should be LAUGHED at and MOCKED and exposed for the frauds that they are   &mdash;   lies used to tear down the foundation and morals of White Western Civilization   &mdash;    to devastating effect.</p>
<p>Imagine:  Freud&rsquo;s three (ridiculous) central doctrines were the theory of the Oedipal complex, childhood sexuality and that repressed sexuality caused neurosis.  Freud&rsquo;s tenants that children have a sexual attraction to their opposite sex parent or that boys desire to kill their fathers and mate with their mother is outright ridiculous.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Freud&rsquo;s theory of sexual repression has had a profound influence over a wide range of areas of American culture including sociology, criminal justice, child rearing practices, education, art, literature even permeating popular media such as TV and movies.</p>
<p>Alan Eterson writes in An Exploration of the Work of Sigmund Freud:</p>
<p><i>There is evidence that Freud fraudulently portrayed the data underlying these concepts. Freud&rsquo;s patients did not volunteer any information on seduction or primal scenes at all.</i></p>
<p><i>The seduction stories that provide the empirical basis of the Oedipal complex were a construction by Freud, who then interpreted his patients&rsquo; distress on hearing his constructions as proof of the theory.</i></p>
<p>#10 Anon:</p>
<p><i>Psychiatry is responsible for much of the soft on crime legislation. For decades psychs blamed crime on childhood experiences.</i></p>
<p>A pernicious outgrowth of &#8220;psychoanalysis&#8221; in the criminal justice system is Repressed Memory Therapy:</p>
<p><i>RMT has been behind lengthening the statutes of limitations in some states to periods of 30 years or more to provide enough time for repressed memories of crimes to surface.</i></p>
<p>Freud himself stated:</p>
<p><i>They keep on maintaining that this time nothing has occurred to them. We must not believe what they say, we must always assume, and tell them, too, that they have kept something back&hellip;. We must insist on this, we must repeat the pressure and represent ourselves as infallible, till at last we are really told something&hellip;. There are cases too in which the patient tries to disown [the memory] even after its return. &#8216;Something has occurred to me now, but you obviously put it into my head.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>The results of RMT have been devastating as children and adults &#8220;remember&#8221; murders, rapes, satanic rites, incest, cannibalistic rituals, cutting up of bodies, some of which apparently happened in broad daylight at busy child care centers     &mdash;   as those so accused, the vast majority of whom were innocent,  were put away for life based on &#8220;repressed memories.&#8221;  Reversing this has been an arduous process.</p>
