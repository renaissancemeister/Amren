			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, November 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Parliamentary candidates should have a legal right to time off work to campaign, and parties should offer bursaries to would-be MPs from poorer backgrounds, a think tank says.</p>
<p>The Institute for Government said Westminster was &#8220;overwhelmingly white, male and middle-class&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just one fifth of MPs are women, and 27 out of 650 are from ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The cost and time involved could deter &#8220;candidates from non-traditional backgrounds&#8221;, the organisation said.</p>
<p>The report acknowledged parties&rsquo; past diversity efforts, including all-women shortlists by Labour and the Conservatives&rsquo; &#8220;A-list&#8221; of approved candidates.</p>
<p>But the Institute for Government argued that improved selection methods were &#8220;only part of the answer&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is increasingly not overt or covert discrimination within political parties, but the lack of women applying to become candidates in the first place. The same is true for other under-represented groups,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Increasing supply&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>It went on: &#8220;Parties need to focus on increasing the supply of aspiring parliamentary candidates by removing some of the barriers to participation, including the high cost and time commitments, which act as a significant deterrent to candidates from non-traditional backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Childcare costs mean that this can be a particular barrier for women, while disabled candidates also often face extra costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report cited examples of one MP who had sold her house &#8220;in order to get elected&#8221;, while another candidate had been left so badly in debt after a failed campaign that she could no longer afford to attend the party conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parties have to open their doors more widely and diversify the ways in which people can become involved in their activities,&#8221; said report co-author Rhys Williams.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will only be through bold action that the problems of low public participation in the political process and an unrepresentative Parliament can be addressed.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For the life of me, no matter how much I read and learn, it never ceases to amaze me how much Whites hate themselves, and that they honestly believe that importing the Third World into their countries, feeding and housing them, letting them rape the indigenous population (both literally and figuratively), and finally giving them positions of power will somehow strengthen the nation as a whole. Or maybe they don&rsquo;t really believe it.</p>
<p>God knows I&rsquo;m not the conspiracy type, but I&rsquo;m really starting to think that this is all part of a concerted effort to eliminate <i>any</i> majority in <i>any</i> nation in the West, knowingly pitting differing vastly different racial groups against each other (knowing they can never <i>ever</i> get along), thus making the population easier to manage and control.</p>
<p>Or maybe I give the multi-cults too much credit. Perhaps they really are delusional.</p>

		<p>Well, Britain IS overwhelmingly white and middle-class.  Logically, Britain&rsquo;s House of Commons will mirror this.  Of course Britain is only 50% male, but I wonder, why do people these days think that women should become politicians at all?  There&rsquo;s not a single female politician in the entire world I have even an ounce of respect for.  Palin, Clinton, Bachman, they&rsquo;re all jokes to me.  I guess I do admire Marine La Pen, because she&rsquo;s so tough and nationalistic&hellip;but, aside from her, I can&rsquo;t take women politicians seriously.  Its ridiculous, to see these silly broads in their pant-suits, acting like they can stand up there with the men and dictate policy.  Stick to your cooking and cleaning ladies, and leave the policy-making and politicking to us, please.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with female political activists.  I think its great that they vote and take an interest in politics, and some of the most adamant supporters of nationalism are women.  BUT, elected figureheads (and, I&rsquo;m talking about major figureheads, like presidents, mayors of major cities, senators&hellip;not small-town councilpersons, members of the school board, etc.) should always be men.  Its just the way things are ment to be.</p>

		<p>When you consider that the British parliament is wholly and solely responsible for the race disaster unfolding in Britain (including the imposition of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; on groups of workers less priveleged than they are, also parliament passed whole rafts of &#8216;race realtions&rsquo; acts that privelege &#8216;ethnic mionorities&rsquo;), it is only right and fitting that white, male MPs should have a taste of their own medicine and be denied political careers due to their race and gender.<br>
  An ethnic minority dominated parliament wouldn&rsquo;t be any worse than white dominated but anti-white parliament we have now.</p>

		<p>The West is committing suicide.</p>
<p>As we live in Knoxville, my wife and I have decided to consciously &#8220;de-Africanize&#8221; our lives as much as possible.</p>
<p>HOW WE ARE DE-AFRICANIZING OUR LIVES</p>
<p>1. We give to charities benefiting Appalachian whites but few other charities.<br>
2. We stopped eating at Famous Dave&rsquo;s because its music is overwhelmingly black.<br>
3. Our city is 15% black  &mdash;  much too high, so we&rsquo;re remodeling our <br>
home to move to a smaller, whiter town nearby (Pigeon Forge).<br>
4. No more NBA or NFA for us. My wife isn&rsquo;t into sports anyway.<br>
5. We sought out a church with large numbers of white children and give generously to (white) baby showers at our church to encourage white procreation.<br>
6. Herman Cain? Sorry. His supporters are into &#8220;white guilt.&#8221; If this serial predator of white women is on the ticket, we&rsquo;ll just stay home.<br>
Etc. etc.</p>

		<p>The BBC thrive on this sort of article, it is rammed down our throats daily.  They are not called the British Brainwashing Corporation for nothing.  One of their own called them &#8216;hideously white&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fact that the Institute for Government wants us to be governed by &#8216;candidates from non traditional backgrounds&rsquo; says it all.  &#8216;Tradition&rsquo; will be got rid of at all costs.</p>

		<p>MPs in Britain are elected by constituencies, and some with large ethnic groups often vote for candidates of their own group (be they Lab, Lib, Con or anything else).  We already have a sufficient sprinkling of ethnic MPs in the House of Commons.  An anti-white selection list is neither sensible nor democratic.  The reductio ad absurdum of this &#8220;representative&#8221; notion would be to &#8220;elect&#8221; a parliament of 50 percent women, percentages of each census-classified ethnic group, plus an obligatory 3 per cent of homosexuals, bisexuals, transgenders, transvestites &c; (a reduction in this case!).  What about age, &#8220;special needs&#8221; and other disabilities&hellip;<br>
A black 18-year old Muslim lesbian with an IQ of 90, one eye and one leg, would make an examplary choice for Prime Minister, no doubt! As it is, however, we do have Baroness Warsi who told her fellow-Muslims: &#8220;If you can&rsquo;t live by our values, get off our island.&#8221;<br>
So not all is bad, or is it?</p>
