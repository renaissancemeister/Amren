<h1>EMU Abuzz over Planned Kilpatrick Speech</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Oralander Brand-Williams, Detroit News, November 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Plans to host former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick at an Eastern Michigan University student event next week are drawing outcries from students and alumni.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. on Nov. 29 in the EMU&rsquo;s Student Center Ballroom at a program organized by the student group Black Leaders Aspiring For Critical Knowledge (B.L.A.C.K.).</p>
<p>The president of the EMU chapter of B.L.A.C.K., Nicholas Patterson, says the purpose of inviting the embattled former mayor to speak is to &#8220;increase awareness of second chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Kilpatrick is expected to speak briefly speak &#8220;about what he did, why he did it, and also, the road to redemption,&#8221; said Patterson in an invitation about the event. &#8220;As everyone has their own political views, we ask that you come with an open mind and listen in! We believe that Mr. Kilpatrick is the perfect person to speak about second chances and that this event will help somebody, if not now, in the near future.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Efforts to reach Kilpatrick, who is mired in federal indictments alleging racketeering and embezzlements in connection with city contracts, were not successful. Kilpatrick, who now lives in Texas, awaits trial on the charges of public corruption next year. He has been on a tour throughout the country to sell his book, &#8220;Surrendered: The Rise, Fall and Revelation of Kwame Kilpatrick.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It really is this simple. For a black person in public life to receive the support of the black community, they must meet two criteria. They must be black, and they must arouse the ire of some white authority (the police, majority of white voters, etc.) It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have been accused of child molestation (Michael Jackson) or decapitating your wife (OJ Simpson). Black people know how to stand by their man.</p>
<p>Recall the Michael Vick fiasco. Black carried placards saying &#8220;Everyone makes mistakes.&#8221; Only a mistake is something you do unintentionally, like perhaps hitting someone with your car. How you unintentionally run a dog-fighting ring for years at a time is a question for the great afrocentric intellectuals of our time (Somebody get me Michael Eric Dyson on the phone).</p>
<p>The black comedian Patrice O&rsquo;Neal put it best when he said, &#8220;White people, at this point black people really don&rsquo;t like Obama anymore either. But we can&rsquo;t let you know that, because we know you hate him.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The fact that the &#8220;Big Pimpin&#8221; former Mayor isn&rsquo;t in federal prison right now is all the evidence you need that being black and connected will get you not just get &#8220;second chances&#8221; but unending chances via the race card. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the blacks in attendance of this function admire this criminal black for &#8220;doing work&#8221; and rubbing it in the white man&rsquo;s face.  </p>

<p>Maybe it should have a requirement that all about-to-graduate seniors should write one long paragraph before they&rsquo;re able to receive their degrees, like its urban cousin, Wayne State University, does, or at least it used to according to the regular AR poster Proactive.  That might put an end to some of this B.L.A.C.K. malarkey.</p>

		<p>Making Kilpatrick mayor was like making the school yard bully the Principal of the school. </p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the white media, white governor and state police, Kilpatrick would have become Idi Amin Dada or black Hitler.   Kilpatrick is a classic race baiter, white hater and crook.  Had he not gone to prison, the blacks of Detroit would have elected him again and again.    </p>

		<p>In a job I had several years back, I worked with a newcomer to the South who was originally from Detroit.  She opened my eyes about Kilpatrick because he was basically all she ever talked about, along with decrying the overall status of the city she was born and raised in.  Since then, I&rsquo;ve met and befriended many people from Detroit.  I used to be sad about what happened to my native city (Atlanta) in the 70s-90s but after getting an earful from these former Detroiters, I realize Atlanta was and is a cakewalk in comparison.</p>
<p>How sad is it that yet again, a group of young people, college students, have been bamboozled into believing that a very, very corrupt man has turned &#8220;good&#8221;? </p>
<p>Also incredible is the fact that Kilpatrick has been touring to pimp a book about his so-called revelation when he has not yet even faced trial. Where I come from, if a person errs egregiously then he or she must pay in some way.  Instead, he&rsquo;s literally being put on a pedestal.</p>

		<p>Yes of course he deserves a second chance, he is living in a mansion in Texas while refusing to pay the one million dollars he owes in restitution, utterly unrepentant and claiming he was set up by a vast conspiracy. Why not waste more government money on paying him speaking fees to speak at a tax payer funded university?</p>
<p>Interestingly the Detroit courts appear ready to pull his book from the shelves since he is refusing to pay restitution from the profits of this book, which according to this article has made an amazing $19,000 in profits.</p>

<p>The black man always gets a second chance at redemption while the white man is condemned and told to disappear off the face of the earth; persona non grata.<br>

<p>Kilpatrick will probably be re-elected mayor of Detroit someday just like Marion Barry&rsquo;s numerous comebacks in D.C.</p>

		<p>The culture of the African black peoples seems to go with them wherever they are in the World.  Having lived in South Africa for 24 years they are just as forgiving of serious crimes there by black leaders who have been guilty of the most horrendous murders, with them  being allowed to stay in power or if a short jail sentence is completed, to return a hero.  Many of the leaders of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s African National Congress Party were guilty of murdering many black people as they coerced the masses to join their quest for power.  Necklacing, the act of placing a car tyre around a victim&rsquo;s neck, filling it with gasoline before setting it alight, was only practised on blacks and in front of a large public gathering.   If it had ever been done to a white person in the old South Africa, there would have been the civil war that perhaps should have happened, but the ANC supported by the Soviet Union propagandists knew what they were doing.  This is why Apartheid (separate development) was formed to separate the black cultures from the civilised European ones for the sake of future peace, but we all know what happened.</p>

		<p>Blacks function best with a &#8220;strongman&#8221; (dictatorial) form of government.<br>
Asians function best with a &#8220;cult of personality&#8221; (deified leaders) form of government.<br>
Whites function best with an &#8220;representative republic&#8221; form of government.</p>
