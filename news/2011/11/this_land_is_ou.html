<h1>This Land Is Our Land  &mdash;  For More Than Forty Thousand Years</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Pritchard, BNP Ideas, November 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New scientific findings have shown that the ancestors of today&rsquo;s British people have lived here more than twice as long as was previously thought.</p>
<p>Results of new analysis of surrounding fossils and rocks, published in this week&rsquo;s edition of the scientific journal of record, Nature, prove that the fossil teeth of one of our ancestors, found in Kent&rsquo;s Cavern, near Torquay in Devon in 1927, are at least 41,000 years old. Double their previous estimated age.</p>
<p>The fossils are of a modern White human, who suitably barbered and attired could walk unremarked through a shopping centre anywhere in Britain.  Genetic analysis has already proved all genuinely indigenous Britons can trace their ancestry back to this Palaeolithic population, the first modern humans ever to live here.</p>
<p>We may have additional blood from later waves of North-West European invaders  &mdash;  Celts, Saxons, Vikings, Normans etc., each wave vigorously resisted by the natives  &mdash;  but if you are genuinely a native Briton, some of your ancestors lived here when the Great Ice made a wall across England a mile high. If you are an Immigrant, born here or otherwise, they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In one celebrated study, for example, DNA studies showed a schoolteacher in Cheddar, Somerset, was a direct descendant of fossil humans found nearby at Cheddar Gorge. Many other genetic analyses and results also prove our descent from our Ice Age British ancestors.</p>
<p>Until now it was thought that these First Britons arrived after the last, or Devensian, glacial advance had retreated from Britain, about 12-14,000 years ago. However, in 2009, further radiocarbon isotope analysis at Oxford University revealed that one of the oldest Britons, the so-called &#8220;Red Lady of Paviland&#8221; (actually a young man ceremonially buried), was 33,000 years old, more than twice as old as had been thought.</p>
<p>Now it appears our ancestors were here thousands of years even before that. They would have moved southward as the glaciers advanced after 22,000 BC, but after the last glaciation&rsquo;s midwinter 18,000 years ago they would have moved back north again, reclaiming our homeland from the Ice mile by mile, year by year, generation by generation, in a thousands of years long war against the Winter of the World. A war in which our ancestors won our right to our land for ever.</p>
<p>Yet again science proves we are NOT a &#8220;Nation of Immigrants&#8221;. Our ancestors were the first modern people ever to live here, and we have lived here now for over four hundred centuries. For at least forty-one thousand years, almost ten times the span of all recorded history, this land has been our land. We must not lose it, still less must we give it up, now.</p>
<p>* From page 32 of Four Flags: The Indigenous People of Britain (DNA, History and the Right to Existence):</p>
<p> &#8220;Creswell Crags and Gough&rsquo;s Cave</p>
<p>Another Upper Palaeolithic site which shows that the earliest British inhabitants were present on this island nation tens of thousands of years ago, has been found at the Creswell Crags, a gorge in Derbyshire, in the East Midlands. There, several caves have produced archaeological evidence of modern human habitation dating at between 40,000 and 10,000 YBP.</p>
<p>The relatively northern position of the Cresswell site is a further indicator of a more widespread Upper Palaeolithic presence in Britain.</p>
<p>The region would only have just been free of the retreating glaciers, and for it to have been inhabited at that early stage must imply a relatively large population further south.&#8221;</p>
<p>By Arthur Kemp B.A. (Pub. Admin., Pol. Sci., Int. Pol.). Contrary to what the liberal left allege, the native people of the British Isles are a distinct, identifiable and homogenous indigenous people who have every right to exist and be free from invasion and domination  &mdash;  like any other indigenous people on earth. This booklet proves that the vast majority of the British people have ancestors going back to the last mini ice age more than 12,000 years ago. Table of contents:</p>
<p>1. Introduction (Deals with the denial of indigenous status to the British people)</p>
<p>2. Indigenous People  &mdash;  A Definition (uses UN and other definitions)</p>
<p>3. Haplogroups and the Genetic Identification of Peoples (explains Y-Chromosomes, mtDNA and Autosomal DNA in detail, and how they are used in forensics and history to identify and track peoples to specific areas)</p>
<p>4. The Haplogroups Which Mark the Indigenous People of Britain (explains which haplogroups are indigenous to Britain)</p>
<p>5. A History of the Peopling of Britain (a potted history of the people who have made up Britain through settlement, i.e. Euro base population, Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, Normans  &mdash;  including figures on actual numbers of settlers and their genetic impact as measured by haplogroup)</p>
<p>6. Four Flags, One Nation: The right of the people of the British Isles to existence and freedom from colonisation, domination and dispossession of their lands and culture.</p>
<p>This booklet reveals:</p>
<p>* Genetic evidence shows that the vast majority  &mdash;  nearly 80%  &mdash;  of all British people have ancestors going back to the end of the last mini ice age 12,000 years ago;</p>
<p>* Genetic evidence showing that the Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Viking/Danish and Norman conquests had negligible impacts upon the British people (less than 5 percent each);</p>
<p>* Genetic evidence showing that the Irish people have far more in common with the British than both sides of that traditional divide realise.</p>
<p>* The people of the British Isles have been indigenous peoples for far longer than many other nations who are already classified as &#8220;indigenous&#8221; by the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.</p>
<p>This booklet also shows how the indigenous people of Britain are fully protected by the United Nations Charter on Indigenous Peoples from &#8220;dispossession of their territory&#8221; through &#8220;mass population transfers&#8221; and from &#8220;forced integration and assimilation&#8221; and &#8220;destruction of their identity and culture&#8221; (all according to the United Nations.)</p>
<p>Even more importantly, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states that all indigenous peoples have the right to define who is part of their nation and who is not. This is the killer booklet to destroy the final left-liberal argument against the right of Britain to be British. {snip}</p>

		<p>I think this is great and long overdue, for those of us with British ancestry or even with Northern, and true Continental European ancestry.  By definition ALL indigenous people must be protected.  This provides for the beginning of a new recognition of Europeans as having a lawful right to their own lands and with that, a right to their lands and to not have them overrun or usurped by ANYONE.</p>

		<p>I have noticed over the Years how the British Ethnic Identities<br>
have been erased and slowly written off. I, along with many posters here, am Ethnically British. I am also a Canadian Traditional British groups like English and Scottish and Welsh are viewed as Ethnic Groups in Canada and elsewhere (and People know what You are talking about when you mention an Englishman), but over in the U.K. there aren&rsquo;t any British Ethnic groups? Its the anyone can be British mantra.<br>

<p>Whites are an indigenous people in Europe.  Once accepted as fact, the only battle is over the terris nullis of America and Australia.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t morally obligated to alter the racial character of America and Australia, but this is the argument put forth by Asians and Africans:  Because of the &#8220;history of colonialism&#8221;, they want to grab a piece of the New World, to &#8216;even the score&rsquo; with whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s racial competion, and we&rsquo;d better be aware of their agenda.</p>

<p>The out of Africa theory holds that all modern humans descend from Africans who left about 40,000 years ago. Out of Africa used the wrong data, fraudulent methodology and the researchers were anti White marxists out to prove that Whites are somehow inferior to Africans.</p>

		<p>I recently worked on a job in Durham Castle, Durham, Northern England. I was there for just over three months. Work started on construction of the Castle in 1070 A.D. by the Normans.</p>
<p>When one spends time in a place like that, the sense of History is quite profound, I can tell you.The oak beams in the roof structure could have started life as acorns in the 10th century.</p>
<p>What possible link to Britain can 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants to this Country possibly have? They are interlopers having been here but the blink of an eye. We all know who the true British are and non of them are dark skinned.</p>

		<p>You are correct #6. White people were in the Americas long before the Asiatics; about 6,000 years before them. </p>
<p>So what happened to all the Whites that lived in the Americas before the Asiatics? They were killed by the invaders. So, historically, it could be our first genocide of any note.</p>
<p>There are some Native Indian Tribes that have a unique genetic maker that denotes European ancestory. Apparently, some of the Whites bred with the Asiatics, and then vanished. </p>

		<p>Samuel Huntington, who wrote &#8220;Who Are We?&#8221; stated:<br>
&#8220;America is not a nation of immigrants, but rather of settlers and immigrants.  An Anglo-Protestant settler society came to the new world in 17th and 18th centuries.  Settlers leave an existing society as a group in order to establish a new community with a sense of collective purpose.  Immigrants do not create a new society but rather join the existing society created by the settlers.  Colonists conceived themselves founders, settlers, and planters, not immigrants.  Settlers brought Christianity, Protestant values and moralism, a work ethic, English language, British traditions of law, justice, land ownership and limits on government power, and a legacy of European art, literature, philosophy, and music.  This original culture persisted 300 years, including especially language, religion, principles of government, manners, and customs.  Immigrants became Americans by adopting the Anglo-Protestant culture and political values, which benefited them and the country.  Millions of immigrants achieved wealth, power, and status in American society precisely because they assimilated.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The UK organisation MigrationWatch has launched a petition for a parliamentary debate on immigration control to prevent the future population of Britain reaching 70 million largely as a result of the non-white or foreign immigrant birthrate.</p>
<p>Maybe this organisation and the petition are not enough, but it would be a disaster all round if it failed to reach the minimum essential target of 100,000 British signatures.</p>

<p>Looks like we, Whites have allowed the invaders to come  right back in and do the same thing all over again, doesn&rsquo;t it? What is it about the genetic makeup of the White race that has this suicidal death wish?  Can someone here please elaborate on this?

<p>Bardon, I thought the exact same thing.  But focus also (and mete out all due punishment) on those who are conducting genocide against the British people..</p>
<p><i>Britain is a small yet wealthy country populated by a rapidly declining indigenous race representing less than 1% of the global population, and whose territorial homeland makes up less than 1% of global habitable area.</i></p>
<p>Indigenous Britons make up less than one percent of the world&rsquo;s population yet have been slated for extermination. Unbelievable and beyond evil.</p>
<p>Patricia Morgans writes in <i>Ethnic Cleansing in East London</i>:</p>
<p><i>Housing was the key to opening up the East End to outsiders&hellip;.Cooperation between the local authorities and ethnic leaders led to blocks of flats being set aside for Bangladeshi occupation, along with a substantial proportion of new and renovated housing.</i></p>
<p><i>New arrivals from Bangladesh went straight to the head of the housing queue by dint of their family size, because many Muslim men routinely have four wives each and seven children per wife, all &#8216;legally&rsquo; supported by the British State in a literal tsunami of polygamous demographic warfare.</i></p>
<p>Polygamy is illegal in Britain, BTW.</p>
<p><i>With their habitat gone, there are many fewer whites in family households; the average number of children in a Bangladeshi household is more than seven times that in a white household.  White families are in direct competition with immigrants for scarce resources and services, especially housing and education</i>  </p>
<p><i>The whites who resent the loss of their locality are mocked as pathological inadequates who are incapable of living alongside people different from themselves.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/utfua" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/utfua</a></p>
<p>The 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article II states:</p>
<p>Genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group as such:</p>
<p>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;</p>
<p>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.</p>
<p>The present immigration and political policies of Britain are in violation of part (c) and possibly part (d).  </p>
<p>The UN?  Anti-White to the core.  NO help will be forthcoming from that organization, only calls for MORE Third World immigration into White homelands.</p>

		<p>Bon #19: Absolutely. And yet Ron Paul is the ONLY Republican Candidate to say over and over again that the US should withdraw from the UN, and all other foreign world bodies, treaties, and entanglements.</p>
<p>Ron Paul actually wants to bring our Troops home. We heard that &#8220;promise&#8221; in 2008, but, of course, it never happened. The rest, on both sides, are just talk, and more talk. It&rsquo;s all noise, and no substance. </p>
<p>This is why Ron Paul has been marginalized, again, during his Election bid. The Controlled Media are scared to death of this guy, and what might happen if Paul was actually Nominated by the GOP. </p>
<p>The GOP in no way wants to Nominate Ron Paul. He has to be put there by us, and without any question that he is the one the majority of their Party wants, as their Candidate. </p>
<p>If the Republican Machine had nominated Ron Paul as their Candidate in 2008, he would be President, today.</p>
<p>So, we can continue to debate the merits of Ron Paul as a &#8220;White Nationalist&#8221;, or &#8220;White Realist&#8221;, or we can look at his record, and his consistant remarks, and note that he would Audit the Federal Reserve, seal our borders, trim excessive, and Unconstituional spending, withdraw from the UN, and stand firm on the grounds of US sovereignty, and Constitutional liberties. </p>
<p>If we could regain those things that we apparently have lost over the past few years, we could put our house in order and the rest would fall into line. </p>
<p>The UN should come with a warning label, that it is Dangerous to White people, everywhere. <br>

<p><i>&#8220;I&rsquo;m afraid this needs to be taken with a large pinch of salt,there are untold numbers of genetic surveys that contadict the findings of this report.&#8221;<i></i></i></p>
<p>Such as!</p>
<p>The research by Mr Kemp was thorough and painstaking, and certainly not a myth as you assert.  The onus is on you to prove his data incorrect along with the timescale and dates of the fossils found.</p>
<p>We are talking about between 40,000 to 12,000 years ago in which DNA evidence proves that the early pre Ice Age and post Ice Age inhabitants and later incomers were of local European origins not, Arab, Australian Aborigine, Indian, Innuit, Mongolian, Oriental and/or black.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve met Mr Kemp on more than one occasion.  No one has proven his data incorrect as yet.</p>

<p>What myths?  Can you dispute the findings with contrary evidence? Confusion how?  Well!</p>

<p>You miss the point by a mile, old son!  England was and still is merely an unbroken stretch of land which includes Scotland and Wales.   </p>
<p>The United Nations Marxist revisionists have been recently conspiring with our domestic traitorous elite to deny the indigenous status not only of the English, but all of the British <b>whose origins hail from Europe</b>, a short way across the Channel.</p>
<p>England, like the rest of the Britain and for that matter, the British Isles, will be unable to defend their respective territories and native peoples without the inter co-operation and support of the individual nations that constitute Britain and the British Isles.</p>
<p>What country was the ethnic homeland of the Anglo-Saxons?  Well!</p>

		<p>Mr Swain, if you choose to believe the junk genetics of amateurs such as Stephen Oppenheimer (profession: paediatrician) you&rsquo;re welcome to, just so long as you keep it to yourself. These crackpot theories (and others) have been deliberately circulated to create precisely the confusion about ethnic origins/national identity that I have already referred to. Genetics/DNA are invoked precisely because few people have the scientific training to grasp the issues and to sort sense from nonsense and fact from speculation.</p>
<p>England is the ancestral homeland of the Anglo-Saxon settlers and their modern descendants. It did not exist before they arrived, but was part of what might be termed (in English) Greater Wales. </p>
<p>As Pan-Britannicists, the BNP (whom I otherwise support politically, having nowhere else to go these days) have their own very good pragmatic reasons to promote what I am happy to repeat IS a creation myth: i.e. that a majority of the long-settled indigenes of the British Isles are the direct descendants of those settled there 40,000 years ago. Even the Celts, who still so deeply resent the English (&#8220;Saesneg&#8221; - i.e. &#8220;Saxons&#8221; - in Welsh) for expropriating the better part of the island of Great Britain from the 5th century AD onwards, have only been settled here for a fraction of that time.</p>
<p>I repeat, be careful about requiring such a long period of settlement to establish a legitimate territorial claim; just think of the consequences for whites in North America! </p>
