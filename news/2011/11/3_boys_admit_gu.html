			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cindy Horswell, Houston Chronicle, November 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year after Cleveland was rocked by allegations that an 11-year-old girl was gang-raped by 20 boys and men, the first admissions of guilt by three suspects this week could help this small timber town heal from a divisive scandal that seized national attention.</p>
<p>Three boys, who were 14 to 16 years old at the time the sixth-grade girl was assaulted, have admitted their part in the scandal in plea agreements presented to Liberty County court-at-law Judge Tommy Chambers.</p>
<p>{snip} The remaining suspects continue to await trial, including three more juveniles and 14 adults, ages 18 to 27.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m so glad to hear (about the admissions),&#8221; said the victim&rsquo;s mother, Maria, whose name is being withheld by the Houston Chronicle to protect her family&rsquo;s identity. &#8220;Not only for my 11-year-old, but for other children who have gone through this, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mother, who relocated to a safe house outside Liberty County after the allegations became widespread, wants to see &#8220;justice done,&#8221; but is concerned about putting her daughter through the stress of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Revelations that the girl was allegedly raped by multiple men or boys on at least four occasions over a three-month period beginning last fall fueled outrage and controversy in the town of 8,000 residents. Explicit videos of the sexual incidents were recorded on cell phones and passed around the Cleveland schools.</p>
<p>A Cleveland police officer&rsquo;s sworn affidavit described one encounter where the 11-year-old went &#8220;riding around&#8221; with two of the defendants and wound up at a house where she was ordered to disrobe. If she refused, the affidavit said, she was warned that other girls would &#8220;beat her up&#8221; and she would never be given a ride home.</p>
<p>During this interlude, one of defendants called four others who joined in the assault, which later moved to a vacant trailer.</p>
<p>The incident was further inflamed when Houston community activist Quanell X, flanked by bodyguards, held a rally in Cleveland at which he questioned the handling of the investigation. While saying he wanted the guilty punished, he said he also wanted to make sure &#8220;someone with a malicious racist motive was not trying to rid your community of a generation of black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the defendants in the case are black, while the victim is Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the defendants contend the girl was sometimes a willing participant, but law enforcement says there is no excuse for anyone to have sexual relations with a child.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>&#8220;help this small timber town heal from a divisive scandal&#8221;</p>
<p>Note this phrase by Ms feminist Cindy.  It is more important that the blacks &#8220;heal&#8221; their hurt feelings that once out of 100 times their vile sexual practices were exposed than that justice be done. The rape was &#8220;divisive&#8221;.  How dreadful!!!  Nothing wrong with blacks behaving like blacks, but the rape was &#8220;divisive&#8221;.</p>
<p>If all 14 of the adults are put away for a long time, the rape and other crimes rate will go way, way down for a long time.  </p>

		<p>Is it any wonder that Mexican gangs seem to want to kill all blacks? If I were a betting man, my money would be on the Mexicans because of their toughness and they are more intelligent than blacks. The 100 meter dash is of little use in this kind of arena. Contrary to their own beliefs, they are a legend in their own minds, blacks are not physically tough.</p>

WRONG! That is thinking like a white person. Africans don&rsquo;t think that way. &#8220;My buddy did this and got sent up for 10 years&#8221; does not enter their heads when they are moved to commit some act of rape, theft or other crime. They simply think they will not not get caught, if they think anything at all.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s true. And maybe that&rsquo;s why the first poster actually meant there won&rsquo;t be other crimes because the perp will be spending the rest of his life behind bars and won&rsquo;t be able to commit any more. </p>

		<p>Why do blacks always cry about needing to &#8220;heal the community&#8221;  after some of them commit a crime?  They never say &#8220;fix the community&#8221;, so it&rsquo;s not about correcting behavior.  I think it&rsquo;s just another example of black egomania and attention seeking - they all want to be part of the drama.<br>

		<p>To the last poster - the song- I heard on the radio tonight - &#8216;Wasn&rsquo;t Me&rsquo; is the perfect example of the black mindset. The guy in the son is caught red handed, cheating, even on video, his contention - ? &#8216;Wasn&rsquo;t Me.&rsquo; Brilliant Defense. </p>
<p>He just says this over and over. This isn&rsquo;t jovial, it&rsquo;s factual. This IS their mindset, if they say it over and over enough times, they think it will come true. Totally nuts.<br>
But consider their IQ- most are at or below the level of the mentally retarded - so in our ultra lib pathetic country, they get a free pass- on everything from rape and all other race crimes against whites, to being able to cause drama and shoot their loud mouths off anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>Yep, hang em, don&rsquo;t bother with the life long free ride in prison. That&rsquo;s a reward, we are looking for punishment.</p>
<p>But not one other solitary black will learn a thing from that - if it were to happen- which, it never would, not anymore, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Which is hwy we, as pathetic, spineless Americans have a larger prison system than China AND Russia- COMBINED !!! -just another way to siphon away your tax dollars.</p>
<p>On Quanell X, - &#8220;he wanted the guilty punished, he said he also wanted to make sure &ldquo;someone with a malicious racist motive&hellip;&#8221; -now wait a minute- doesn&rsquo;t HE have a malicious, racist motive, in trying to get a free pass for another pathetic, weak minded black ? OF COURSE !</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m poster #2  </p>
<p>I wrote &#8221; If all 14 of the adults are put away for a long time, the rape and other crimes rate will go way, way down for a long time. &#8216;</p>
<p>I certainly did not mean that blacks, especially the rapists in this case would consider this. I did not mean that blacks think of the consequences of what they do. It is true that black criminals think they will never be caught.  It is true that black rapists think that as long as the victim did not shoot them dead  &#8220;she wanted it&#8221;  so it wasn&rsquo;t really rape.</p>
<p>What I meant was the simple fact that when a criminal goes to prison he can&rsquo;t commit more crimes when in prison.  If 14 rapists are in prison, there will be less rapes in the town.</p>
<p>3 strikes and long sentences bring the crime rate down because the criminals are isolated in prison. 14 adult and 6 juvenile rapists in prison means less rapes.<br>

<p>You&rsquo;re right in saying that twenty rapists sent to prison means that they&rsquo;re not out in public to rape 11-year old Hispanic girls and 80-year old white women.  But they&rsquo;re still dangerous in other ways.</p>

		<p>This story is laughably funny in a tragic sense.</p>
<p>The standards for what constitutes an honourable action have been dropped so low, that teenagers admitting to gang-raping an 11 year old, is seen in a bizarre sense, as a positive action. I think what this article shows us, is even white liberals are running out of justifications and explanations for black behaviour. It seems reporters these days come equipped with a rolodex of sugar-coated vernacular, to explain black misbehaviour. The troubled &#8220;youths&#8221; were in the &#8220;wrong place and wrong time&#8221; and made &#8220;wrong decisions&#8221; and insert  &mdash;    &mdash;  heinous crime happened. </p>
<p>In this case 20 guys gang-rape an 11 year old. We all are wondering where are the feminists? But the journalist, has to find one shred of positivity in the story, so voila, THEY CONFESSED. </p>
