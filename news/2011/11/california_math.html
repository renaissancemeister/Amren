			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jill Tucker, San Francisco Chronicle, November 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the race for educational excellence, California hovered near the back of the pack yet again with only Mississippi and the District of Columbia languishing further behind, according to 2011 math and reading scores released Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One silver lining in the grim data were significant gains by the state&rsquo;s African American students, with black fourth-graders outperforming their peers nationwide.</p>
<p>Overall, California&rsquo;s math and reading scores inched up a few points, contributing to a long-term trend of slow but steady improvement that slightly outpaced national gains over time.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the money each state spent on schools didn&rsquo;t always correlate with higher test scores, states with the best scores often outspent most others by a few thousand dollars per student.</p>
<p>High-scoring Massachusetts, for example, spent about $14,000 for each child, compared with a national average of $10,500, according to 2009 Census data. {snip}</p>
<p>California spent about $9,700.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia, which posted the lowest scores, spent $16,400 per student.</p>
<p>With the exception of fourth-grade reading, which was stagnant, scores rose across the country overall since 2009. But only Hawaii showed statistically significant gains in both grades and both subjects.</p>
<p>In mathematics, 40 percent of all fourth-graders and 35 percent of eighth-graders scored at or above proficient in 2011.</p>
<p>In reading, 34 percent of students in both grades were proficient in reading.</p>
<p>In California, 34 percent of fourth-graders and 25 percent of eighth-graders were at least proficient in math, about the same as the year before. In reading, 25 percent of fourth-graders and 24 percent of eighth-graders were proficient.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the state&rsquo;s demographics are a liability on national tests, its diversity is also an &#8220;untapped asset,&#8221; said Arun Ramanathan, executive director of The Education Trust  &mdash;  West, an education advocacy group in Oakland.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cultural and linguistic diversity of California&rsquo;s students should be viewed as a strength that gives us an advantage in an increasingly global economy,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Only thing worse than the dumbing down of the classroom is its aura effect. That is, the kids who might have been good at math and reading are sucked into the vortex by the dim ones. So we not only lose the dumb ones themselves, but the borderline ones who tak up all the time and attention that might have been used to make marginal students proficient. Very sad.</p>

		<p>In the early 1970&rsquo;s the UC University System was the best in the world.  Very high-quality education, at very low cost. In 1980, a UC Cal student paid only $776 in tuition.   But that was when the state of California was 85% White.  </p>
<p>Now that California has the benefit of Diversity, and has imported 10 million low-IQ Third Worlders, the state is a wreck, educational achievement has plummeted, and the UC University system is in rapid decline.  </p>
<p>Social costs to feed, house, incarcerate, and educate the vast unwashed Third World masses have bankrupted California.  In 2010, California spent $6 Billion on prisons, but only $4.7 Billion on higher education.   California spends more to incarcerate their &#8220;Gift of Diversity&#8221; than they do on higher education!   </p>
<p>California was once the greatest State in the Union, but is now becoming just another Third-World Heck-hole. America soon to follow. </p>

He needs to elaborate how this is an advantage when these students cannot read or write at a proficient level.  These kind of statements are nothing more than head in the sand denials.  More likely than not this country will regress to a third world status at this rate.<br>

		<p>Who was it that said if you repeat a lie often enough, the people will believe it?</p>
<p>The article quoted some Indian guy as saying: &#8220;The cultural and linguistic diversity of California&rsquo;s students should be viewed as a strength that gives us an advantage in an increasingly global economy,&rdquo; </p>
<p>This is their standard fall back line of defense: &#8220;diversity is good, no matter what the evidence shows, because we say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thinking behind their favorite pet &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; phrase is that only a person of race X will know how to sell something to another person of the same race.  </p>
<p>Funny thing is, before we gave America to the &#8216;world&rsquo;, white guys had no problem selling our stuff to anyone.  Now everyone buys from China.  Is China worried about importing enough blacks, latinos and even whites to &#8216;compete in the global marketplace&#8221;?</p>

<p>How is having a student body that is 50% Mestizo going to give you an advantage in a global economy?  Why isn&rsquo;t Mexico already a global economic powerhouse if that is so?  I assume that Arun is Indian by origin.  I thought this kind of idiocy only afflicted white liberals.  If California is now spending less per child on education than many other states it&rsquo;s because the tax paying white people are being pushed out.  Eventually the Mestizos who have taken over California will discover that they have to pay for their own children&rsquo;s education, there won&rsquo;t be any white people left to do it.</p>

<p>I think these tests are only taken in grades 4 and 8. </p>
<p>They do better than other BLACK students nationwide but that is not saying much. They are less terrible than other terrible students.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the people who claim diversity is an asset are well paid consultants. There is infinite money to be made selling magical snake oil cures to the achievement gap.<br>

		<p>Since the cheating was exposed, no &#8216;study&rsquo; is worth the electrons it&rsquo;s printed on.

<p>Only way they out performed all peers their age was if they had White (or Asian, or at least half white) teachers changing their answers. </p>
<p>Or that could just mean Cali black 4th graders scored higher than black 4th graders in other states &hellip;. which isn&rsquo;t much different than saying &#8220;my retard is smarter than your retard&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Cliff, Post 13,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the Marxist constantly chant:<br>
DIVERSITY IS OUR GREATEST STRENGTH<br>
EACH RACE BRINGS NEW IDEAS TO THE TABLE<br>
CELEBRATE DIVERSITY</p>
<p>while at the same time &hellip;</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RACE<br>
WE ARE ALL THE SAME<br>
RACE DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER</p>
<p>And, even though &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; and &#8220;there is no such thing as race,&#8221;  every Federal, state, county, city, governmental, academic, charitable, and business organization supports an expensive and unweildly Office of Minority Affairs bureaucracy that carefully records every tiny detail and aspect of race.  Why?  Because race doesn&rsquo;t exist, of course.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough to make a thinking person go insane.</p>

<p>He is wrong. We had a winning American homogeneity built squarely on Western Civilization and a common Enlish language once in California and were first in the nation for public education. Today, we have many languages and are 43rd from the top for public education despite spending a great deal more per student than we once did in real dollars.</p>
<p>What we see is the third world has degenerated California and its public education system. </p>
<p>Also, I agree with those who have stated most students cheat in CA today. The morals degenerated as well.</p>

		<p>The socio-biology of gender differences makes its impact in all this.  The American psychologist/physician Arnold Gesell   documented back in the 1940&rsquo;s the gender differences in rate of development and in visual-motor abilities, using then cumbersome movie cameras donated to his project from Hollywood.  Curriculum design can narrow the gap at lot.  It is not unlikely that having (electively) separate male and female math classes in the early<br>
grades would narrow the (overlapping) group attainment differences<br>
in this subject area.  </p>

		<p>Reality is, if Third World descendents are becoming an increasing percentage of the America population, then people of wite, European descent are America&rsquo;s greatest untapped asset. Whites will remain the largest population group with a proven capability of producing scientists, engineers, top managers and academic scholars. Sorry to break the news.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, most of the white American population remains educationally underdeveloped.</p>

How did such a non-diverse nation as Japan (and now Korea) produce the world&rsquo;s most popular cars? Do they have blacks and Mexicans secreted away some where to give them those &#8220;diverse ideas&#8221; that we are told are so essential?  </p>

		<p>This is not the first time and the first country whose school system has been destroyed by ideology and affirmative action.</p>
<p>The nazi party schools mission was: &#8220;The supreme task of the schools is the education of youth for the service of Volk and State in the National Socialist spirit.&#8221; </p>
<p>The american school system&rsquo;s mission is: To teach that Whites must be destroyed so diversity can flourish.</p>
<p>Grammar schools and high schools throughout Germany now had National Socialist teachers of questionable ability forming young minds in strict adherence to the Party motto: &#8220;The supreme task of the schools is the education of youth for the service of Volk and State in the National Socialist spirit.&#8221; They taught Nazi propaganda as truth and had their young students recite it back from memory.</p>
<p>During the war years, the Hitler Youth organization gradually supplanted the traditional elementary and secondary school system and became the main force educating German children. And the quality of that education continually worsened. Students emerging from the elite Adolf Hitler Schools were in superb physical condition and thoroughly drilled in Nazi ideology, but lacked basic skills in math and science.</p>
<p>Nazi scientists, educated before Hitler, complained they were hindered in developing new super-weapons by the recruitment of graduates from the Nazified school system. German Army leaders also complained that young officer candidates displayed &#8220;a simply inconceivable lack of elementary knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even know enough to capitalize the first letter of a proper name. But for Hitler, these shortcomings really didn&rsquo;t matter. The school system now produced what he needed – unquestioning young men ready to obediently serve the Fatherland unto death amid Nazi slogans such as: Believe, Obey, Fight!</p>
