		<p>I worked at a Pizza restaurant for 4 years, and blacks were always our worst workers.  I thought I&rsquo;d found two exceptions for a while - 2 black delivery drivers who politely insisted on taking the garbage out the dumpster several times a night.  Being a naive liberal at the time, I just thought they were especially &#8220;clean&#8221;&hellip;but I found out after a few months that they were smoking pot behind the dumpster on every trip.  I still have no idea how they hid the smell.</p>
<p>And yes, they drove stoned through white neighborhoods every night.  Thank goodness no one got run over!  <br>

		<p>This story obviously sits exactly at the crossroads of lots of common points that are made on AmRen, but I think it&rsquo;s also a good example of how being around blacks and the language they use brings the rest of us down. Note how the reporter says &#8220;I seen you&#8221; and &#8220;You got two felonies, man&#8221; in a pathetic effort to talk on the same level as these, um, hardworking gentlemen.</p>
<p>I live overseas and I would be mortified if any of my friends here saw this. For those who are without the conditioned White American repsonse of intently staring at the floor when something like this comes up, the reaction is nothing short of astonishment.</p>

		<p>I must come down on the African side on this issue. Before I was a victim of Diversity/immigrant unemployment, I often &#8220;caught a buzz&#8221; or &#8220;took a gulp&#8221; at work. If anything, the software that I produced was better, not worse. </p>

Thrown a few hand grenades in my time where the fuse was cut too short and almost lost a limb &amp; always felt that it was a factory worker on weed or booze that produced that little death object.  You&rsquo;ve got some nerve bragging about that on a story concerning &#8220;stoned, black workers&#8221; producing important armored vehicles for our military.  Too bad your not gainfully employed now.  Thanks for your input anyway, just confirms the decline of our once great country.    </p>

		<p>While prior commenters may have indulged in using some unapproved chemical at work and had better output, the issue here with these people is that they smoke then run their hand/foot into some machine, get disability and sue the company for not catching their drug use, which costs us all money.  At no point would any of them assume responsibility&hellip;.</p>

		<p>If one of those frames on the airbus 350 that this plant builds disintegrates; the airline will be in trouble, not the people who screwed it up from the beginning. How many welders, steelworkers, etc. in the military have to do rework to make their vehicles serviceable? </p>
<p>At my first command we had a minority who was busted for pot and already had a page 13 (administrative remark) in his service record for the same thing. This was in the days of E-6 and below getting a mulligan for popping positive for weed. Once this individual came back positive a second time, he screamed racism from the mountaintops. However his claim was denied as the ENTIRE command (White, Black &amp; Filipino) was tested. </p>

Same for pro sports who keep raising tv cable rates to pay for the 100 million dollar salaries not to mention how the 100s of billions spent on advertising is tied directly to the high price of everything and a big reason why everything went to China and India upsetting the import export ratio. </p>

		<p>What kind of money do these reprobates get paid to &#8220;work&#8221; in a unionized defense contractor plant?  They ought to be able to afford some better quality gourmet indoor grow two pipe hit weed instead of that that Mexican blunt wrap garbage they seem to smoking. As for the bottles in the bags, they ought to be able to afford Courvoisier cognac instead of those ghetto store malt liquor fortys and Night Train wine. Of course all of the foregoing would require some rational analysis, discipline, foresight and planning on their part. </p>
<p>A friend of mine worked a few summers during his college days in a GM engine block casting foundry during the early seventies. He described this exact same behavior among the Black &#8220;workers&#8221; there. They couldn&rsquo;t fire them when they caught them getting stoned at work. They could only make them sit in the break room (still on the clock) until their shift was over and then they punched out and went home. The irony though was that a few Chevy 350 engine blocks left that foundry with blacks&rsquo; teeth embedded in them after more than one inattentive shuckin&rsquo; and jivin&rsquo; stoner got knocked off the catwalk by the overhead crane into the crucible below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you FELT the software you worked on with a &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; was better but in fact it was crap. Thrown a few hand grenades in my time where the fuse was cut too short and almost lost a limb &amp; always felt that it was a factory worker on weed or booze that produced that little death object. You&rsquo;ve got some nerve bragging about that on a story concerning &ldquo;stoned, black workers&rdquo; producing important armored vehicles for our military.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe it was crud, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t. Some drugs - marijuana and major psychedelics - pretty much amplify what you&rsquo;ve already got. If you are intelligent and creative, then you may have easier time channeling that creativity. It has happened. I know. Then again, if you&rsquo;re neither, or you&rsquo;ve got a job where creativity doesn&rsquo;t really matter, then those substances are just drugs. In any case, having people on any drugs while on job is simply disgusting. No self-respecting, honest human being who occasionally uses psychedelic drugs as a tool to improve himself, would ever go to work under even lingering effects of those substances.</p>
<p>Smoking pot on work is even worse than drinking on job, though. It doesn&rsquo;t incapacitate you any worse, but as long as pot is illegal, it&rsquo;s spitting in the law&rsquo;s eye on top of being just horrible for efficiency.</p>

Blacks aren&rsquo;t the French, there&rsquo;s a big difference.  It used to be traditional for Germans to have beer at lunch, and it never negatively impacted the famous &#8220;German Engineering&#8221;.  But blacks start with 85 average IQs, then get stoned and drunk&hellip;bad news for quality control!  <br>

		<p>Recall the Omar Thornton case where a black man was caught on camera stealing beer and was then shown the footage before being fired. He went to work and killed eight of his white coworkers, saying afterwards, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of racism here. They treat all the black people bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never mind that he was the only black worker in the beer plant. The Mainstream media ran with his story. Racism caused him to kill nine white racists who were conspiring to fire him from his job, because he was black.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be the one to hand any of these &#8220;people&#8221; their pinkslips.</p>

		<p>While I understand that this is a purported &#8220;expose&#8221; on how some workers building equipment for the U.S. military goof off on their lunch hour by drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana; this video had no shock effect. That&rsquo;s due to the comedic narration that accompanied it. The narrator might as well have done a shtick for &#8216;America&rsquo;s Funniest Home Videos&#8221;, or &#8220;Jackass&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those of us who have worked with Bantus, shouldn&rsquo;t really be surprised.</p>

<p>Here in Chicago we are lucky if there is one straight White person on the news. If there are two Whites, one is easily identified as homosexual.</p>

		<p>I know something about this subject, i.e. the prevailing winds of african-uplift in Detroit, which is one American African city if ever there was one. </p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that right across the water from Detroit (85% black; 200,000 abandoned structures; city gov. 100% black), is Windsor Canada (2% black; zero abandoned structures; city gov. 100% non-black). </p>
<p>I visited Detroit and Windsor myself a few months ago: the contrast was striking to say the least. </p>
<p>Check out this tour of a Chrysler factory in the presence of an official, unionized Chrysler &#8220;World Class Manufacturing&#8221; (WCM, as he repeats) tour guide, who sounds about as intelligent as an average seven year old white child. It is quite amazing that Chrysler would consider this person fit to represent them to the international media; it&rsquo;s an indication of their suicidal commitment to diversity, which in hilarious almost Orwellian dystopia, is now more important than having competent workers who contribute anything at all except government uplift quota numbers. </p>
<p>Same thing with the Tower contractor video above. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Chrysler factor vid : </p>

		<p>I appreciate the comments regarding the abuse of mood-altering substances, including alcohol.  Most of our cultural problems today, all the way from a botched fast food order to murder, can be directly traced to people who are unable to get through the day without addling their brains.</p>
<p>My State&rsquo;s budget spends four billion dollars a year cleaning up the social messes of this deluded and unhealthy group.</p>
<p>I think it will call for clear heads and sturdy resolution for those of us who want to maintain a constructive way of life for ourselves.  And in my book that means saving the celebration for when you&rsquo;ve accomplished something worth celebrating.</p>

		<p>Marijuana or other drugs making a person more &#8220;creative&#8221; is complete nonesense.  In mission critical applications such as surgery, or making hand grenades, it will only cause severe accidents. Even in creative applications, such as entertainment, it is still detrimental to good work. I remember seeing a Robin Williams stand-up monoluge, recorded in the 70s. He was obviously high on something. I am guessing it was cocaine. He was completely incomprehensible. He was making strange noises and babbling on about some incoherent nonesense. The venue was a Hollywood comedy club, and the audience was in hysterics. The audience of course consisted of drugged-out celebrities and other liberals. Yes, a person on drugs you can entertain other people on drugs. However, when you record what you say while on drugs, it&rsquo;s not creativity. It is pure garbage. </p>

		<p>What we have is people in positions of trust and responsibility that can&rsquo;t be trusted and don&rsquo;t act responsible. Management is collecting management pay but not really earning  their pay. As far as the union they are said to be co-managing the places. Go to Youtube and type in UAW workers drunk drugged and violent at general motors for good example. OK as i look at that video some questions come to mind, do they have any public drinking laws in that town. If they do where are the police? OK if not, do they have drug laws? If they do where are the police? Not earning their pay, that&rsquo;s for sure. For good story Google:  Gary Webb. Also go to Youtube and look at Gary Webb video and some of the videos on the same page. Also go to The Blaze website. They have the same story but the thing to do is look at the comments about this story. As far as No. 22 mentioning&#8221; Chryslers suicidal commitment  to diversity&#8221;.  How many more times will  Chrysler have to be bailed out or have lifelines thrown to it. What happened when it merged with Daimler.  Could Google it i guess. The responsible ones in this story are the reporter and his news station for letting him do this story. The news stations should do this at every factory that this is going on.  Its a shame the military has to receive  equipment from this company but they should be monitoring  the place themselves. Any wonder why America has trouble winning wars. America&rsquo;s learning curve gets longer and longer.</p>

<p>I disagree. Although I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as easy to identify &#8220;homosexual&#8221; newscasters as one poster here apparently does,  the local left-leaning Chicago stations in my area would NEVER run a story like this.  It&rsquo;s too bad it took a station like Fox News to run this expose.</p>
<p>The Chicago stations are very careful to fawn over every black concern, to make sure that every &#8220;man on the street&#8221; interview includes plenty of blacks, etc. The most negative expose I ever saw them run was of the local Tea Party. </p>
<p>To think that Fox would run such an unapologetic expose of black misbehavior as this, and to assign a white reporter to the story no less, is pretty shocking.</p>

		<p>And Dee during the Second World War was THE arsenal of Democracy. NOT only jeeps and tanks but lots and lots of aircraft built at factories all over the U.S., by the auto companies who retooled in a miraculous fashion from civilian to military use. And of course at that time the employee base was probably what percentage white? Anyone care to guess?</p>

		<p>Seriously, do you think that those toking and boozing blacks had any responsibility for the factory&rsquo;s production? Critical tasks in manufacturing, maintenance, or quality assurance? Of course not! They were employed in janitorial, material handling, and basic facility maintenance (changing light bulbs) jobs. If they couldn&rsquo;t handle those positions, they would be employed as assistant deputy Diversity consultants.  </p>

		<p>My company was on strike and this one black guy crossed the line and went to work. Within a week he was caught either smoking weed or drinking by personal and plant manager. They told him not to do it anymore and let him go back in the building. He was fired once and the union got him back on. I have family in the office who tell me they don&rsquo;t get money to employ blacks and Mexicans.  Bull, this just proves it!</p>

		<p>The title of the story should have been &#8220;Black Defense Factory Workers Put Our Troops At Risk.&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t see any white folks in the crowd. They probably have a few whites in critical position to make sure the parts actually work before going out the door. If I had lost a loved one in Iraq or Afghanistan due to vehicle malfunction, I&rsquo;d be sitting down with a lawyer and showing them this video.</p>

<p>I agree. I wonder how much longer Jobs would have lived and how much more productive he would have been without using drugs? We worry about what China puts in our foods and other products, but we take the word of some slime ball, when they say, &#8220;The is really good stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what your point is.  Bill Gates might not be broader, but he is still alive. </p>
<p>IMACS are obviously better than PC&rsquo;s&hellip;but IMACs and other Apple products are still full of bugs and problems. Without drugs,  Job&rsquo;s visions and product developement could have progressed quicker with fewer problems. In the last five years, Apple products have been impressive. For 25 years before that, Apple products were quite average and unimpressive. </p>
<p>A sober mind makes a person clear-headed and efficient. Drugs cloud the mind and slow work down considerably. Drug use also contributes to mindless errors and accidents.  I&rsquo; ve been on both sides of this issue. Heavy drinking and using drugs is a cop-out.  If you want to stand up to our enemies and win, then throw these poisons to the curb.</p>
<p>If anyone believes that drinking or drugs make you a better worker, you belong on some liberal, hippie website.  Let our enemies get high. We will only win the race war if we are sober. </p>

<p>&#8220;Most of our cultural problems today, all the way from a botched fast food order to murder, can be directly traced to people who are unable to get through the day without addling their brains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those Scots Irish who built the Erie Canal must all have been teetotalers.</p>
<p>People, drug and alcohol abuse is not peculiar to post-WWII America.  Legions of busybodies peering into every nook and cranny to root out &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; behavior for reasons as varied as &#8220;safety,&#8221; &#8220;morality,&#8221; and my own personal favorite &#8220;the children&#8221; are, however.</p>
<p>In my opinion there&rsquo;s not much difference between people who swallow the government propaganda lines on diversity and those who swallow the government propaganda lines on drugs, terrorism, the military, or what have you.  You&rsquo;re still not thinking for yourselves and that makes you ripe to be sucked in by the next Big Scare.</p>

		<p>What happened at the Big Three autoplants was one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped buying American cars years ago.  At least I know that my Toyota truck which was made at a former GM plant with major quality control problems which Toyota took over in the eighties, is always reliable.  I have 130,000 trouble-free miles on it.  The only thing that has had to be rebuilt so far is the front brakes.  When are Americans going to start realizing that this whole &#8220;diversity&#8221; hiring game is dangerous, stupid and self-destructive?  Incidentally, at one point too I was an industrial electrician, and I agree with the other posters who have said that black &#8220;workers&#8221; are too often useless. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the unions coddling them, they wouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>

<p>Yes, getting drunk and high on the job makes you a better worker. If you disagree with me, you&rsquo;r a facist. Yeah, right. Take your pro-drug agenda garbage somewhere else. I&rsquo;m sure the spineless, liberal hippies at the New York Times would welcome your pro-drug comments, but most of us here won&rsquo;t buy it. Drug and alcohol abuse drags our community down. If you support this, then you are part of the problem, as well as the enemy.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree.  I think Steve Jobs&rsquo;s drug use and his obsession with &#8220;alternative&#8221; medicine shortened his life, but I don&rsquo;t think Apple would have been any better off but for his drug use and his prostration to quackery.  That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t buy this notion that Jobs was an uber-genius who is responsible for every good line of code on Earth.  Jobs&rsquo;s forte was recognizing trends then getting in on the ground floor first.  He did not invent the desktop GUI (Xerox did), but the original Mac was the first OS to popularize it.  He did not invent UNIX (Bell Labs did), but Jobs popularized a variant of UNIX (Mac OS 10.0 and newer).  Jobs didn&rsquo;t invent the portable digital media player (the Archos was the first to market), nor did he invent the digital music world (remember Napster?), but he saw the trend coming.  On top of that, Apple makes the kind of products that have sort of finish, fit and feel that make people go ooh-aah.  The original Macintosh was way sexier than Xerox PARC, Mac OS X looks and feels way slicker than its proprietary UNIX or Linux brethren, the iPod is just plain cute, compared to the gawdy looking Archos, and the iPod&rsquo;s market dominance helped fuel the complementary dominance of iTunes.</p>
<p>In other words, Jobs was a good business man.  In that, he and Bill Gates are a lot alike.</p>
<p>Any software product with a lot of lines of code is going to have bugs.  Even if the CEO is using some sort of drug, it ought not matter, because the CEO doesn&rsquo;t mother with mundane stuff like bug fixes.</p>
<p>Incidentally, my whole problem with the iCabal is that they sell slavery as freedom and get away with it quite handsomely.  I will admit, though, that some people need to live inside the Apple walled garden, and some people are simply far more productive inside of it than they would be with any other computing solution.  It&rsquo;s just that I want people to make these decisions with their eyes wide open, if they choose to live in the Apple walled garden, they&rsquo;re not only going to pay for the privilege, they will be subject to the whims, censorial and otherwise, of Apple management.  But, their hand-holding customer service is exceptional.</p>

<p><i>I don&rsquo;t know what your point is. Bill Gates might not be broader, but he is still alive.</i></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t trying to make a point.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel, better here are a few things Gates said about Jobs (just to even things up a bit):</p>
<p>Gates on Jobs: (When Apple was thinking about buying NeXT) <i>He just shamelessly ripped off other people&rsquo;s ideas.  You really think Steve Jobs has anything there? I know his technology, it&rsquo;s nothing but a warmed-over UNIX, and you&rsquo;ll never be able to make it work on your machines. Don&rsquo;t you understand that Steve doesn&rsquo;t know anything about technology? He&rsquo;s just a super salesman. I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re making such a stupid decision &hellip; He doesn&rsquo;t know anything about engineering, and 99% of what he says and thinks is wrong. What the hell are you buying that garbage for?</i></p>
<p>Not that Gates knows anything about education (but thinks he does).</p>
<p><i>I think Steve Jobs&rsquo;s drug use and his obsession with &#8216;alternative&rsquo; medicine shortened his life.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;   QD</p>
<p>Yes, I think so too.  I&rsquo;ve read about his strange fasting habits, his &#8220;fruititarian&#8221; diet his &#8220;only apples and carrots for weeks&#8221; diet, his vegan diet   &mdash;   plus the fact that he did not seek immediate treatment for his cancer in 2003, preferring alternative treatments instead.</p>
