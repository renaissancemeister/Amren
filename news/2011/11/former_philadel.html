			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike DeNardo, CBS Philly, November 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former Philadelphia schools superintendent Arlene Ackerman, who was given a nearly $1-million buyout earlier this year, has applied for unemployment.</p>
<p>School District spokesman Fernando Gallard today confirmed that Ackerman wants to collect state unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This comes after taxpayers funded a $905,000 buyout when she was shown the door in August (see related story).</p>
<p>As part of her separation agreement, the School Reform Commission agreed not to contest any unemployment claims she might file.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Based on her former salary, Ackerman would be eligible for the state maximum of $573 a week.</p>

		<p>Arlene Ackerman was Superintendent of San Francisco Schools from 2000 to 2006 - and did exactly the same thing there. In SF, she only got $375,000 from the taxpayers for severance (she didn&rsquo;t get along with others and spent $45,000 of taxpayer money on fancy restaurants and travel). </p>
<p>Pretty funny to hear she did it again, but for Philadelphia it cost $905,000 to get rid of her; I doubt her &#8220;Dream Academies&#8221; in Philadelphia were any more successful than the failed &#8220;Dream Schools&#8221; in SF. How did she get hired again, with that history? One guess.</p>

		<p>Why not give her a farm, and 30 years back payments for discrimination against black farmers, too?  They sure do know how to milk the tax payer and make out big even when they are incompetent or lazy.  If you are black, everybody wants to throw money at you.  Yet the stupid college kids, libertarians and commies are protesting just that kind of golden parachute and buyout for Wall Street bankers at tax payer expense.  I&rsquo;m waiting for their outcry about this little sweet heart deal.  Still waiting.  Waiting&hellip;..</p>

		<p>You ought to go online and read the high, high praise Mr. Obama personally gave this disgusting person! She, incidentally, received a doctoral degree from (where else?) Harvard (Incubator of Liberal Left Affirmative Action dirtbags) and was made a member of the  &#8220;Education Leadership Faculty&#8221; at Columbia Teachers College (ibid.) She was practically canonized by representative Ronald G. Waters, Chairman of the Pennsylvania Black Caucus, and she is still hotly defended by Philadelphia Democratic Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell, a notorious loudmouth, ignoramus and white-baiter. Ackerman thoroughly raped the San Francisco School District before coming east to rape us. She mishandled millions of dollars, demanded a personal chauffeur and bodyguard, and installed a predominantly black administration to rule like petty tyrants over a largely white teaching force. In the end, when she had alienated everyone and faced dismissal, she used District monies to hire pro-Ackerman picketers who carried signs reading &#8220;Keep your White Paws Off Our Black Queen.&#8221; She left this city in such an ungodly financial mess, that over 3,000 school employees were laid off (with lots more to come starting this week). She also left a ton of racial enmity in the school district that will likely never heal. Of course, the Nubian morons who hired her have largely fled in disgrace, too. So welcome to the &#8220;Wonders of Diversity&#8221; here in Killadelphia, Sewer of the Western World!</p>
<p>Still, I HAD to laugh when one utterly fed-up teacher posted this comment online at the Philadelphia Notebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arlene was a leader who, prudent and kind,<br>
Enriched each curricular area;<br>
A boss and a muse we were lucky to find -<br>
And I am the King of Bavaria!&#8221;</p>
<p>In this black pit, you&rsquo;d BETTER keep a sense of humor!</p>

		<p>Hey, Philly Gal,</p>
<p>You are obviously a longtime resident of Philthadelphia, as was I.</p>
<p>As I am fond of saying, this once grand old city of the Northeast has become a filthy, crime-ridden dung heap.  This city deserves the Milton and John Streets, the Blackwell contingency, Arlene Ackerman, et al.</p>
<p>Mayor Nutter seems like a decent enough guy, but he&rsquo;s still the worst kind of Clinton-era, multicultural Democrat.  I see little hope for the city and don&rsquo;t go there anymore unless absoltuely necessary.</p>
<p>As far as Arlene Ackerman is concerned, the outrage has been universal.  The bottom line is that she is what she is.  But at least now the whole country knows what she is, too. </p>

		<p>Wait a minute. After the HUGE scandal this woman(??) caused out here in Babble-on By the Bay. Wait&hellip;trying to grasp this..another school district took her on?  This is some kind of extortion racket run by Ackerman and whoever hired her. They&rsquo;ll probably split the take. And you folks back East make fun of California.

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure of the wisdom of singling her out.  This sort of<br>
wealthy rake off of unemployment benefits is old old hat and<br>
the many in the majority population have had little reluctance to &#8220;getting theirs&#8221;.  It is a character issue, not a racial issue.  </p>

		<p>This charlatan should be in jail not receiving benefits. In case anyone is unaware, she presided over an education authority where teachers were &#8216;encouraged&rsquo;, under threat of dismissal, to over-mark black exam tests and allow blacks extra time to complete examinations - sometimes actually supplying the answers! In return she was lauded as a miracle-working educator who &#8216;proved&rsquo; that with extra investment black academic performance could be on a par with low-achieving whites. A large part of this &#8216;extra investment&rsquo; ended up in her pay-packet as a &#8216;performance-related&rsquo; bonus. Imagine if it had been whites allowing White students the same leeway in order to over-compensate for the (very real) discrimination they face as a result of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo;. At least this would be just - there must be a level playing field. Of course, she is not the only one - she&rsquo;s merely been caught out. What a sorry mess we&rsquo;re in. I&rsquo;m surprised that more concerned voices from the &#8216;black community&rsquo; are not making themselves heard. This is tremendously damaging to those black students of ability who have earned their laurels fairly. Who will believe it when this sort of thing is going on - and could easily have been predicted as the inevitable outcome of a system where pay is linked to the results of affirmative action in education. There will always be unscrupulous individuals who will manufacture the requisite &#8216;results&rsquo; - like any two-bit shyster. If I were her I&rsquo;d be very worried. There must be a lot of students who can pin-point their failure to obtain a college place to this woman&rsquo;s self-enriching fraud. I recommend tinted windows in her limo&hellip;</p>

		<p>Many teachers are wonderful people but&hellip;</p>
<p>Teachers make up some of the lowest SAT scores admitted to college. From memory, the bottom 4 majors by SAT score are:</p>
<p>Teachers&hellip;4th from bottom.</p>
<p>Public Administration (no kidding)&hellip;3rd from bottom.</p>
<p>Home Economics (some schools still offer this as a major) 2nd lowest<br>
 <br>
Vocational majors such as truck drivers, welding and barber college. Bottom scorers of all post secondary &#8220;college&#8221; students.  </p>
<p>I quit a good IT job to become a teacher and was astonished at the ignorance and laziness of many teachers.  The only teachers that I felt were &#8220;intelligent&#8221; were the math, science and business/accounting/IT instructors.  Art, history, gym, elementary and all others were generally quite dumb in my opinion.  </p>
<p>I only spent 3 years as a teacher before I took a part-time business to a full-time occupation but teaching was an eye-opening experience.  Teachers generally work 190 days per year giving them 175 days off including every weekend, summer, major holiday.  The pensions and benefits are incredible. </p>
<p>In Michigan you start at about 42k per year with a BA degree and after 20 years you can easily make 85k with a MA degree.  If you teach summer school and drivers ed. you can make 100k after 20 years and just under 100k after 30 years.   </p>
<p>The local  newspaper recently reported that my old superintendent (of a lower-middle class district) was making 183k per year.  Believe me, that guy couldn&rsquo;t make 183k in the private sector if his life depended on it.  He got the job because he was a personal friend of the school board president and gave jobs to all the city officials friends and family.  I had never seen nepotism on such a grand scale. </p>
<p>Less than 5% of people in America make 100k or more per year.</p>
<p>I also taught in an all black charter school in Detroit and EVERY administrator there drove a BMW or Mercedes Benz.  They would cram as many students into a classroom as the law would allow (36) and then tell you to teach.    </p>
<p>Teacher colleges are a cash cow for many universities.  People who cannot &#8220;hack it&#8221; in other majors generally become teachers.  Having a college of ed. boosts enrollment and tuition income of the school by keeping the lowest common denominator in school.  I don&rsquo;t think I read a single book while in graduate school and graduated with a 3.9 GPA. In fact, most of the time I didn&rsquo;t even buy the text books assigned for my classes.  Some classes required that I actually have the book to do certain assignments and had to purchase those.  </p>
<p>Yes, it was quite an experience. After 3 years as a teacher I decided that the world of education didn&rsquo;t deservie me&hellip;lol.   I Just my opinion and my apologies if you are a teacher who has a clue.  <br>

		<p>When I heard this yesterday on Glenn Beck I KNEW she was BLACK, which of course Beck nor Rush dared to mention. Most blacks are such leeches and have NO shame whatsoever. They also KNOW that it is Whites who pay most of the taxes, so they love to stick it to Whitey again and again. When are we going to take that knife out of our collective backs and repatriate them all back to Africa? They are a blood sucking race and we allow them to continue unabated.</p>

If they put the issue in racial terms   &mdash;   and honest man would   &mdash;   the outcry would be so enormous that sponsors suddenly would pull out, leaving their respective shows with far less money to pay the hosts.

<p><b>Arlene Ackerman: I Did Nothing Wrong </b></p>
<p>&#8220;How dare he say anything. He pushed me out,&#8221; Ackerman says about Mayor Nutter&rsquo;s criticism of her filing for unemployment</p>
<p>By Teresa Masterson |  Wednesday, Nov 30, 2011  |  Updated 10:15 PM </p>
<p>As government and school officials voiced their outrage about former Philadelphia School District Superintendent <b>Arlene Ackerman&rsquo;s </b>decision to file for unemployment, there was one more outraged voice Tuesday: Arlene Ackerman&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did nothing wrong. How dare he say anything. He pushed me out,&rdquo; Ackerman told NBC Philadelphia&rsquo;s Lu Ann Cahn in a phone interview from Albuquerque.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;he&rdquo; in Ackerman&rsquo;s statement is Mayor Michael Nutter.</p>
<p>After the school district was notified last week that Ackerman - who received a $905,000 buyout - was filing for her $573-a-week unemployment benefits, Nutter added to the disgusted voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the financial crisis facing the Philadelphia School District and the nearly one million dollar settlement agreement that the former superintendent received, it&rsquo;s astounding to me that she&rsquo;s coming back to the district seeking unemployment compensation,&#8221; Nutter said in a statement to the Inquirer.</p>
<p>In addition to being angry that Nutter would say this, Ackerman told NBC Philadelphia that the buyout of $905,000 may sound like a lot of money, but it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>
<p>Ackerman said that about 40 percent of that lump sum is going to be taken out in taxes, and $130,000 of that she will not receive for a few years.</p>
<p>Ackerman also said that her retirement benefits were cut in half, compared to what she would have received if she remained as superintendent.</p>
<p>Her bottomline is this: She doesn&rsquo;t have a job and, while she&rsquo;s looking, she&rsquo;s not sure when she will find another job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did nothing wrong,&rdquo; Ackerman said.</p>
<p><br>
Here&rsquo;s some of the &#8220;nothing&#8221;:</p>

<p>And the fact that this was at some sort of school meeting (and not a farewell dinner or something) makes it doubly obscene.  Absolutely INCREDIBLE! (and considering that she stumbled on half the words, it was apparently written by someone else).</p>

		<p>So according to the Occupy Wall Street, she would part of the 1%.</p>
<p>Seriously, I worked for a black, affirmative action supervisor in education.  (He was a self-professed former gang member with only three years teaching experience - in a resource room!)  And so then he was perfect for a diversity hire into supervision!</p>
<p>There is not enough space available in this posting box to tell you all the stories of incompetence and cronyism I witnessed.  Except for the young social justice liberals, all teachers over 30 years old were on this evil man&rsquo;s hit list.  Almost 50% of the staff left voluntarily in disgust after being fed up with that pea-brain of a man.  He was removed from his duties two years later and given a job as a   &mdash;    &mdash;   success coach!</p>

<p>Thursday, August 18th, Dr. Arlene Ackerman addressed The School District of Philadelphia&rsquo;s annual convocation of school principals ahead of the start of the new school year. Entering to Sade&rsquo;s &#8220;Is it a Crime&#8221; and ending with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes&rsquo; &#8220;Wake Up Everybody&#8221;, the speech received a rousing standing ovation. It is one the most powerful speeches she&rsquo;d ever delivered as head of the nation&rsquo;s 8th largest school district.</p>

<p>She exemplifies the oft-noted undeserved overly high self-esteem of many blacks. Apparently though she has been a successful SELF-PROMOTER.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The local newspaper recently reported that my old superintendent (of a lower-middle class district) was making 183k per year. Believe me, that guy couldn&rsquo;t make 183k in the private sector if his life depended on it. He got the job because he was a personal friend of the school board president and gave jobs to all the city officials friends and family. I had never seen nepotism on such a grand scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not at all to defend this low life so-called educator. But I had to comment on your stament about the mythical private enterprise. I used to be in the bar business. Some bars can make a lot of money. At least half to 3/4 of my fellow bar owners who earned over 200K a year were total losers and were just lucky in a variety of ways. Other friends of mine tell me in corporations it is about ass kissing, who you know etc. I believe at least half of getting rich is luck if not 90%.</p>
