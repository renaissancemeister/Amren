			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Urbanski, The Blaze, November 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The guy dressed in the suit and tie, smiling and shaking a bevy of hands, caught Grayson Thomas&rsquo; eye.</p>
<p>Grayson wasn&rsquo;t alone. Teachers and other students at Stevenson Ranch Elementary School couldn&rsquo;t take their eyes off the lunchtime visitor, either.</p>
<p>Grayson, a fifth-grader at the campus near Santa Clarita, Ca., noticed the gentleman&rsquo;s outward characteristics: Tall and lean. Good looking. Charismatic. Charming. Energetic.</p>
<p>Then he made a fatal error: Grayson, 11, pulled a little &#8220;made you look&#8221; joke on a schoolmate seated next to him, saying something along the lines of &#8220;Obama&rsquo;s visiting our school today,&#8221; referring to the magnetic figure holding court nearby.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t Obama, of course. But from Grayson&rsquo;s point of view, Chris Schauble  &mdash;  morning co-anchor of KTLA 5â€²s TV news program in Los Angeles  &mdash;  did possess a demeanor and countenance similar to the president&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>According to Grayson&rsquo;s dad, Darren Thomas (who provided the previous details), what happened next was scary: Word of his son&rsquo;s Obama-Schauble comparison spread to Schauble&rsquo;s daughter, Shelbi, who was sharing lunch with her newsman father. And Shelbi was uncomfortable with Grayson&rsquo;s statement, saying it felt racist.</p>
<p>Then a teacher was summoned, then the principal, Candace Fleece, then the Newhall School District superintendent, Marc Winger. And that very afternoon, Nov. 4, Grayson was kicked out of Stevenson Ranch for good, his father says, for implying that all black men look alike.</p>
<p>The Blaze asked school officials and Schauble for comment to little avail. Schauble did not respond to interview requests. School board president Suzan T. Solomon noted &#8220;regret&#8221; over &#8220;misinformation out in the press&#8221; regarding the ordeal but declined further comment. Fleece&rsquo;s office referred the matter to Winger, who offered that &#8220;there are two sides to every story&#8221; but declined further comment, citing student confidentiality issues. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Winger apparently revealed a bit more to a local radio news site, which quoted him as saying, &#8220;It&rsquo;s not what [Grayson] said, it&rsquo;s how he said it&hellip;I can tell you that there was history and that the student had been counseled and we met with the parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s besides the point, says Darren Thomas, that neither Winger, Fleece, nor Solomon  &mdash;  not even Schauble or his daughter  &mdash;  were within earshot to evaluate &#8220;how&#8221; his son originally stated his Obama-lookalike comment. The kicker, Darren says, is that school officials had no basis for determining that Grayson&rsquo;s comparison implied that all black men look alike. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you assume the intent of a child?&#8221; Darren asked. &#8220;This is the thought police. [They&rsquo;re] not God; [their] bureaucratic brain[s have] melted into a mush of political correctness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darren first spoke to Principal Fleece, whom he says assured him that Grayson&rsquo;s past misbehavior  &mdash;  which included stealing school supplies from a campus store with other students and minor classroom outbursts  &mdash;  had nothing to do with the decision to permanently kick him out of the school.</p>
<p>Rather, Darren recalls Fleece explaining, Grayson made the Obama-Schauble comparison in a &#8220;teasing&#8221; and &#8220;mocking&#8221; way&hellip;and the school deals with racism very seriously. (Darren adds that Fleece contacted Schauble and apologized for Grayson&rsquo;s remark.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to Darren, he asked the California Department of Education to open an investigation on possible civil rights violations in regard to Grayson&rsquo;s situation, and he may pursue legal action as well. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;[They]&rsquo;ve empowered a young girl, and all kids connected with this girl,&#8221; Darren says, &#8220;[to believe] that &#8216;If I don&rsquo;t like you, all I have to do is say <em>racism</em> and you&rsquo;re done.&rsquo;&#8221; (He said the student who told Schauble&rsquo;s daughter about Grayson&rsquo;s comment does not like Grayson and, in fact, sent him harassing text messages the following Monday, Nov. 7, celebrating his dismissal. Darren says he&rsquo;s turning over the texts to law enforcement and school authorities.)</p>

		<p>Yet many of these same &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; people will use the term &#8216;redneck&rsquo;, a word that as far as I know is only used to describe whites making it a racial slur. Unless of course native americans can be summed up by this word too therefore making it not a racial slur and Ok to use&hellip;</p>
<p>They wont just use this term but will often do so in efforts to prove to others how enlightened they are.<br/>

		<p>Many years ago a Jewish participant at one of the Amren conferences in Virginia told me that a popular movie named Rosewood was more vicious in its characterization of white people than anything Hitler&rsquo;s people did in the infamous movie Jew Suss.  Things have only become worse since then.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to have forgotten: racism is an idea, a way of thinking, just like vegetarianism or socialism or Presbyterianism.  Americans used to agree that no one should be punished for his thoughts or convictions of conscience, or for freely speaking his mind. Isn&rsquo;t freedom of expression one of Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s universal human rights? </p>
<p>&#8220;I disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it&#8221; used to be the politically correct attitude among the educated, and today&rsquo;s dominant &#8220;minorities&#8221; benefited greatly from it.</p>
<p>If a &#8220;racist&#8221; obeys the laws and pays his taxes, he is as good a citizen as anyone else, legally and morally, and he is as entitled to at least the respect and tolerance of his fellow citizens as blacks, homosexuals, and pornographers.  People forget that the K is a LEGAL organization with the same rights as the NAACP, B&rsquo;Nai B&rsquo;Rith, or the Communist Party.  Or the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beggar is on horseback and he rides more roughly over the world than the Cavalier,&#8221; said John Buchan.</p>
<p>White folks better get hopping or what happened to the aristocrats in the French Revolution could happen to white folks in America.</p>

		<p>I just wonder how we get so many dimwitted teachers in our public schools. Is being a pinhead a requirement these days? I heard this secondhand, but I heard a new ART TEACHER was recently fired after teaching for nine months at my nephew&rsquo;s school, because she WASN&rsquo;T TEACHING ART, but instead just yacked everyday about how great Obama was.</p>

		<p>Racist quotes from Obama&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Dreams From My Father&rdquo;: </p>
<p>&ldquo;I ceased to advertise my mother&rsquo;s race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother&rsquo;s race.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something about her that made me wary, a little too sure of herself, maybe and white.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn&rsquo;t speak to my own. It was into my father&rsquo;s image, the black man, son of Africa, that I&rsquo;d packed all the attributes I sought in myself: the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.&rdquo; <br/>

		<p>Remember- racism is determined by what the &#8220;victim&#8221; percieves, not what the &#8220;perpetrator&#8221; actually meant. For pity&rsquo;s sake, the two men look remarkably similar! I hope this kids parents decide to home school but sue the public school for all it is worth for this ridiculous expulsion. If a black kid was harassing a white kid I am relatively sure that the black kid would not even be punished. </p>

		<p>Maybe I missed it on my quick read of this story, but it seems that no mention was made as to whether or not the elementary school in question is a government school or a non-government school. A view of the school&rsquo;s webpage leads me to conclude that it is a government school.  How sad and how low we have sunk. </p>

		<p><i> Schauble did not respond to interview requests </i></p>
<p>Schauble could have been magnanimous and pressed for the boy&rsquo;s reinstatement. Perhaps that is too much to ask for a &#8220;tall and lean, good looking, charismatic, charming and energetic&#8221; newscaster.</p>
<p><i>Rather, Darren recalls Fleece explaining, Grayson made the Obama-Schauble comparison in a &ldquo;teasing&rdquo; and &ldquo;mocking&rdquo; wayâ€¦and the school deals with racism very seriously.</i> </p>
<p>If this is an accurate representation of Fleece&rsquo;s statement, then he should be fired. He&rsquo;s essentially saying that children should be thrown out of school for their opinions. Sickening.</p>

Here, we see Chris Schauble at the Black Market Bakery, helping decorate Cakes.  Appropriately, he makes a &#8216;Princess Cake&rsquo;.  Then, we see his four daughters, including, presumably, the one traumatized by hearing her father had been accused of resembling the President.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/INdhK" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/INdhK</a></p>
<p>TRAUMA OPPORTUNITIES HERE: <br/>
Trauma One:  The name &#8216;BlackMarket Bakery&rsquo; is an insult to African Americans, triggering Black Genetic Memory of Slave Ships and Auction Blocks.  And why does it always have to be BLACK Market?  Why is it never WHITE market?</p>
<p>Trauma Two:  Someone was surprised Schauble made such a good-looking cake.  They were expecting a disaster.  Why?  Because he&rsquo;s BLACK?  Deny it all you want, white ladies!  We KNOW what you&rsquo;re thinking.  Just THINKING it is a Hate Crime, now.</p>
<p>Trauma Three: A daughter says it&rsquo;s no wonder it took so long for her father to make the cake.  Why?  Because he&rsquo;s BLACK?  This can only mean internalized feelings of inferiority stemming from California&rsquo;s long tradition of Slavery and such.  Well, that, and the oppression heaped upon this innocent family by the Racist name &#8216;BlackMarket Bakery&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I will add that after seeing naked hands kneading and shaping the icing, I will forever associate Fondant Icing with naked hands possibly bearing Germs and Parasite Eggs.  I may never eat Cake again.<br/>

		<p>Although it is hard to believe, even in this day and age, that there isn&rsquo;t something more to this story we aren&rsquo;t hearing, this surely must still go down as one of the more absurdly hysterical &#8220;racism&#8221; overreactions in recent times. It also serves to show that &#8220;Diversity&#8221; continues to hurt Whites and only Whites, and help non-Whites and only non-Whites! </p>

		<p>This is an extreme example of thought policing if I&rsquo;ve ever seen one.  Will this make and stay in the national news (MSM) or will it be ignored?  It&rsquo;s hard to tell so far but my guess is it will be ignored because the child in question is white.</p>
<p>Regardless, my jaw practically hit the floor while reading this article.  In all my four and a half decades I&rsquo;ve never heard of something so egregious.  You can bet I will be watching this story to see how everything pans out.  Thanks for posting it.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s right. The newscaster does look a lot like Obama.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s amazing to think that children are being terrorized every day by rowdy blacks in the schools, but when a school finally expels a student, it&rsquo;s over something ridiculous like this. It&rsquo;s too bad they don&rsquo;t get just as tough with the dangerous kids.</p>

		<p>This is just plain silly. If a black kid had done the same thing, comparing a white newcaster to Bush for instance, then nothing would have been said. </p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s assume for argument sake that the kid was being &#8220;racist&#8221; in saying what he said. So the punishment is to KICK THE KID OUT OF SCHOOL!?!?!? Are you kidding me? Did he bring a weapon to school? Did he wear an American flag T-shirt,LOL? Did he drop a desk onto another kids head( similar to a shopping cart)? He did nothing even remotely close to warranting being kicked out of  an elementary school. At the worst he was verbally joking around. Apparently, if you are white, then that is enough now adays for a little kid to be kicked out of school.</p>
<p>Besides, wouldn&rsquo;t they have preferred keeping this white kid in the government run school? That way they could monitor and brainwash the kid into bowing before the altar of multiculturalism and diversity. Teach him the ends and outs of political correctness. Teach him how to hate himself for being white. By kicking him out, how is he ever supposed to become a productive citizen with liberal white guilt?</p>

		<p>This white kid, despite all the brainwashing kids get in school,he doesn&rsquo;t understand that this is Black Run America (BRA). Well there might be hope yet, but I doubt it. </p>
<p>We truly live in an upside down world. When some kid can&rsquo;t say that some black or the other looks like some other black it&rsquo;s time to make some changes in this country. I hope that kid&rsquo;s parents sue. </p>

		<p>On my own blog, I said in 2006 that Obama, Harold Ford Jr, and A-Rod all look a lot alike.  Recently, I said that University of Illinois QB Nathan Scheelhaase could have a nice career playing a young Obama in the movies if the football thing doesn&rsquo;t work out.  I guess I should suspend myself from my own blog for prostrating to the TALA Doctrine.  And yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t be smarter than a fifth grader.</p>

The best thing for white people to do is to stay away from blacks. As far as possible, don&rsquo;t talk to them, and don&rsquo;t make comments about them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.  Blacks are a nuisance and will stop at nothing to get their way, like a baby to a bottle.  The best thing to do is to just write them off completely so you can have peace of mind and stop getting in trouble or being offended.</p>
<p>But is that possible?  Blacks are everywhere, in every city, school, store, and office.  How is it possible to stay away from them and never speak to them? </p>

		<p>&#8220;after teaching for nine months at my nephew&rsquo;s school, because she WASN&rsquo;T TEACHING ART, but instead just yacked everyday about how great Obama was&#8221;.</p>
<p>Someone in a public sphere commenting about how great Obama is? I would have thought they were bucking for promotion.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Even if the Child flat out said, &ldquo;all Black People look alike&rdquo; is that REALLY a justifacation for expulsion from grade school??&#8221;</p>
<p>When a black person makes the same kind of comment like this it&rsquo;s considered funny or even &#8216;fighting against stereotypes&rsquo;. I suppose you&rsquo;d better laugh quickly enough and in the right way or you could be next to be someone the school has &#8216;had issues with&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Anyway, it&rsquo;s amazing to think that children are being terrorized every day by rowdy blacks in the schools, but when a school finally expels a student, it&rsquo;s over something ridiculous like this&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what zero tolerance is all about.  They create all sorts of tiny offenses that apply only to Whites, such as smoking within 6 blocks of the school.  The administrators come down hard on the Whites because of threats of law suits by NAACP, ACLU, National Lawyers Guild and findings by Judges who go along with every diktat from ACLU, NAACP and National Lawyers Guild.</p>
<p>While Whites are suspended for chewing gum, blacks are free to beat, rob, rape and scream curse words all day long.</p>

		<p>This kid wasn&rsquo;t kicked out of school because of a comparison to Obama. He was kicked out of school because he&rsquo;s white and it was so easy to do!</p>

		<p>this is quite extreme if this is really how the situation played out.  i wouldn&rsquo;t care if the boy was racist and said something to one of his friends at lunch, which should be a less restricted time for children to socialize, as long as he wasn&rsquo;t harrassing or bullying anyone.  i&rsquo;m black and i think there were better ways to handle this.</p>

		<p>This is a travesty, that little racist needs re-eduction and re-moulding through physical labor. This racist white boy urgently needs to be sent to a forced labor camp and made to read a series of books about the great accomplishments of African Americans and their beautiful culture. </p>
<p>Expelling him isn&rsquo;t enough, he&rsquo;s a racist, he may have connections with the K, neo-nazi groups or terrorists. He&rsquo;s only 11 you say? For all we know he could be the next Hitler. Does anyone know if he also denies the holocaust?</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker to this story! This morning at about 6:55am, I turned on KTLA channel 5 morning news. They were mentioning a story about a turkey eating contest, and showing a young asian woman who won. Chris Shauble&rsquo;s comment on the air!!! &#8220;That itty bitty thing? She looks like Ginger Chan.&#8221; Ginger Chan is the young Asian woman who does the traffic reports. Now I think we should all call Schauble&rsquo;s boss and have him fired for racism, because we all know what he was thinking&hellip;.. that all Asian people look alike!</p>

		<p>For your amusement here is a Filipino TV ad featuring an Obama look-alike. Somehow this must be &#8216;racist&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t figure out how (because I am sane).</p>

		<p>Readers should click the link to the original Blaze article as there&rsquo;s quite a bit more where those {snip}s are. </p>
<p>For example the last part of the article reveals:</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Is it because my son is from Alabama originally?&rdquo; Darren says he asked Winger. &ldquo;Is it because Schauble is someone of importance? In Grayson&rsquo;s group of friends, every single one of them is of a different ethnicity &mdash; Korean, Vietnamese, black, white, Hispanic. Our home has always been open to a wide range of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That includes Julian Eubanks, a childhood friend of Grayson&rsquo;s mother who bunked with the Thomas family for the first six months of 2011 while he looked for acting work.</p>
<p>[photo, with caption, of black pal] Julian Eubanks, seated behind his friend Grayson, having fun at dinner</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a man of color and a close friend to this family, I am [offended] that such a grotesque accusation could be made against any of them, especially my &lsquo;G-Man&rsquo;,&rdquo; Eubanks recently commented on a blog. &ldquo;The so called adults in control of this situation have handled it horriblyâ€¦they need to intervene and clear this young man&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;<br/>

		<p>Remember the old saying, &#8220;The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree?&#8221; I believe she actually felt this was racist. It was an attitude she learned at home from her father. I can imagine what type of news anchor her father is.</p>
