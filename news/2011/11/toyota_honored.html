<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toyota was honored this week as Corporation of the Year by the National Minority Supplier Development Council for its commitment to minority suppliers and diverse communities.</p>
<p>Shigeki Terashi, president of Toyota Motor Engineering &amp; Manufacturing North America in Erlanger, said: &#8220;Our company&rsquo;s foundation  &mdash;  The Toyota Way  &mdash;  is built on continuous improvement and respect for people, and this award reinforces our desire to find ways to strengthen and improve our processes, especially through supplier diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the second time Toyota has been awarded the honor, selected by a national committee of minority business owners.<br/>

		<p>Not suprising in the least.  A decade ago, Toyota management capitulated to Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had been leading a campaign to shake the company down.  In a &#8220;historic&#8221; agreement, the company agreed to devote $7.8 billion over the following 10 years toward promoting diversity.  I&rsquo;m sure Jesse and his friends got a healthy cut of the action.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;They have a &ldquo;strong commitment to minority suppliers and diverse communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, but that committment doesn&rsquo;t include the Japanese mainland, because they&rsquo;re not so stupid as to make themselves believe that diversity is their strength. Only a few foolish whites can be duped into believing something so outrageously silly.</p>

		<p>I have gotten Toyotas since 1990.  But I am sick and tired of the multicultural / mixed race commercials.  I am not getting another one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean just including a Black person in the commercials.  Toyota always has a Black man and White woman together, or a White woman looking up to a Black man.</p>
<p>Also I am not ever buying that Mexican beer that has the great looking White woman in a bikini sit in a chair on the beach next to a Black man.  Or going to restaurants with commercials that have X number of White women and X-1 number of White men with one Black guy to round out the party.  </p>
<p>I hope White people note the products that sell the idea that in order to enjoy themselves White people need Black people, and then refuse to patronize that product and politely tell their friends why they refuse.<br/>

<p>I guess they&rsquo;re &#8220;legitimately&#8221; qualified for minority-oriented honors.</p>
<p>But if Toyota is &#8220;moving forward,&#8221; I don&rsquo;t mind moving in the opposite direction; I&rsquo;ll never buy a Toyota (even a Rav 4, or a Tacoma pickup), and I tell everyone why.   </p>

		<p>I deal with this company and it is little wonder their vehicles cost so much.  Basically, I can&rsquo;t sell to them direct on most of the items they buy, but have to sell to these &#8220;minority&#8221; distributors at the same discount I give Toyota, after which the minority distributor marks up the price again and sells it to Toyota.  I suspect Toyota pays about 20% more per item than they would if they were allowed to buy from us direct.  It is a complete and outright handout to these &#8220;businesses&#8221; who offer no value to Toyota what-so-ever, other than appeasing the PC police and keeping Jesse and AL off their back.</p>

<p>I understand Toyota is establishing a massive plant in China to build the above mentioned model, will there be any diversity there?</p>
<p>PC, Diversity, &amp; AA, mix all that up with Jesse Jackson and it sounds like a recipe for a bit of Blackmail, eg. diversify or government departments won&rsquo;t buy your cars!</p>
<p>Has diversity done anything to help Detroit which  once had the greatest automotive industry anywhere in the world?</p>

		<p>#2 Bernie Does anyone know a car company that does not pander to everyone but white people?</p>
<p>Ford still basically pushes the white American cowboy thing.  I bought a V6 mustang this year and couldn&rsquo;t be more happy with it.  Paid $23k for it (stick).  At around 300 horsepower, it&rsquo;s alot of fun to drive but still a reasonable vehicle for most people.  In other words, it seats 4, not 2, like a sportscar would and gets reasonable gas mileage.</p>
<p>If you have money, this car also comes as a tricked out Shelby at 600+ horsepower (and a voided warranty, lol) which challenges some of the really high end cars like those Audi 2 seaters with a V10 engine.</p>
<p>These cars are nice&hellip;..masculine.  </p>

<p>I cannot think of ONE foreign auto manufacturer that does not have a plant outside of the rural area. Those manufacturers are no dummies. They have done site selection well and know full well what will occur if they build their plant in say Detroit for instance. Prefer to build in a locale where the ONLY possible employees are whitey farm boys and whitey farm girls and that is that. Makes sense. The work force is capable, needs little training, is grateful for those jobs, and does very good work.</p>

		<p>I have never understood why corporations don&rsquo;t speak against diversity mandates, and I have never understood why a free nation votes for them. At an absolute minimum, they could expose their opponents as brutes for attacking someone for free speech. They could stop the madness if they just got enough people to complain!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.holmesreport.com/opinion-info/2084/Hey-Toyota-Its-Jesse-Jackson-on-the-Line.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.holmesreport.com/opinion-info/2084/Hey-Toyota-Its-Jesse-Jackson-on-the-Line.aspx</a></p>
<p>Jackson created the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a grassroots civil rights group that would work with corporate America when appropriate &mdash; sponsoring an annual Wall Street Conference on diversity issues, for example &mdash; and call attention to corporate America&rsquo;s shortcomings when appropriate: on issues ranging from minority hiring to community reinvestment. Wielding the threat of unfavorable publicity &mdash; and if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, a boycott by black consumers &mdash; Jackson had waged successful campaigns against companies such as Citigroup and Anheurser-Busch.<br/>
 <br/>
Then, in May of last year, he turned his attention to Toyota.<br/>
 <br/>
The company had attracted Jackson&rsquo;s ire with a promotional campaign that featured a smiling African American man with &ldquo;tooth art&rdquo; in the shape of a RAV4 sport utility vehicle. The image appeared on a postcard, part of a guerrilla marketing campaign, that had been placed in racks in nightspots, fitness centers, coffee houses and other locations frequented by style-conscious youth.<br/>
 <br/>
Toyota had voluntarily withdraw the ad two weeks earlier, after complaints from consumers, but that didn&rsquo;t appease Jackson, who had targeted the Japanese automaker once before. Jackson had clashed with the company a 1998 print ad for Toyota Corolla that highlighted the car&rsquo;s legendary reliability. The ad, which ran in minority publications, featured a picture of the Corolla and copy that read, &ldquo;Unlike your last boyfriend, it goes to work in the morning. The 99 Corolla. 31 years of being dependable, reliable and more durable than most relationships. Imagine. A lasting commitment without ever arguing over the remote control. Too bad Toyota doesn&rsquo;t make boyfriends.&rdquo;<br/>
 <br/>
At a press conference to protest the latest outrage, held outside Toyota&rsquo;s headquarters in Torrance, Cal., Jackson accused the company of &ldquo;using racist advertising while excluding blacks among its dealers, board of directors, and advertising teams.&rdquo; With characteristic understatement, Jackson condemned the ad campaign: &ldquo;The only thing missing is the watermelon.</p>

<p>In 2004, the Ford Motor Company Fund awarded NCLR (That&rsquo;s La Raza for you folks out in Rio Linda.) to implement the Ford Partnership for Advanced Studies (PAS) to support NCLR&rsquo;s mission to improve educational opportunities by increasing the high school and college graduation rates of Latinos. Ford PAS, developed in collaboration with the Education Development Center (a nonprofit research and development organization), is designed to educate, motivate, and prepare young men and women to pursue postsecondary education, enter rewarding careers, and become responsible citizens in a democratic society. The curriculum is composed of five semester-long courses offered in high school (grades 10–12) or in approved alternative settings such as pre-college, after-school, summer, or weekend programs. Ford PAS combines challenging academic content, interpersonal and human relations skills, and business concepts in an integrated approach that encourages hands-on, project-based learning. The goal of this project is to invite NCLR schools to blend the Ford PAS curriculum with their high school design to ensure that each student is well-prepared and highly motivated to meet the requirements of colleges and universities and, ultimately, to fill the needs of businesses and society for capable, productive employees.</p>
<p>Ford PAS is being implemented in five high schools and working with approximately 350 middle and high school students.<br/>

Thank you so much MG.  I&rsquo;ll never buy a Toyota again.  I don&rsquo;t like to buy American cars because of Detroit blacks.  I haven&rsquo;t bought a Ford since my first car because of the Ford foundation.</p>
<p>I know, I know the Ford family and auto company have nothing to do with the Ford foundation and its White genocide program for the last 60 years, but I would rather not contribute to the family that created to Ford foundation to evade the taxes us proletarians have to pay.</p>
<p>I think a German, French or Italian car made in a part of America where there are few blacks. Probably german as there are few fiat or peugot repair shops around. No Tuscaloosa black made cars for me.</p>
