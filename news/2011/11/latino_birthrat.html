<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Perhaps no indicator can say more about a country&rsquo;s future  &mdash;  or a state&rsquo;s  &mdash;  than its fertility rate.</p>
<p>A young population and too much fertility can spell failure. But so can too little, as in a population not replacing itself because it&rsquo;s too old.</p>
<p>This being the case, I&rsquo;ve had trouble getting my arms around how unwelcome Latinos  &mdash;  who are, demographically speaking, among the most fertile of Americans  &mdash;  have been made to feel in this state and in this country. And I&rsquo;m not just talking about undocumented immigrants. Immigrants and Latinos aren&rsquo;t feeling the love these days.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This makes no sense. Were it not for people of color with higher fertility rates  &mdash;  significantly led by Mexicans and Mexican Americans  &mdash;  the United States already would likely be below its population replacement rate. We would be on our way to becoming Russia, whose government is now practically begging its citizens to have babies.</p>
<p>Which is another way of saying America&rsquo;s theoretical model of inclusion has it right. A good mix makes for good outcomes. We&rsquo;re all in it together.</p>
<p>The optimum fertility rate is 2.1, a replacement rate that figures that some women of childbearing years will, for whatever reason, not have babies. The United States&rsquo; fertility rate, according to the World Factbook, is a decent 2.06. Russia&rsquo;s is 1.42.</p>
<p>Thank a fertile Latino.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The Census Bureau estimates that the non-Hispanic white population will contribute nothing to population growth after 2030. It will be declining. After 2030, Latinos will contribute at least 45 percent of national growth.</p>
<p>Welcomed and integrated, replenishment is a gift we give ourselves that other countries will envy. Left to short-sightedness and bitter attitudes of exclusion, well, it&rsquo;s tantamount to eating our young.</p>

<p>Growth cannot continue forever.  We&rsquo;re now at a point where growth is bad.  Natural resources are being depleted at a record pace, and if this level of growth is sustained there will be hell to pay in 50 years for many different reasons.</p>
<p>But, worse than even that, we have a looming financial crisis in our immediate future that is set to get so bad it will dwarf the last great depression by a large amount.</p>
<p>Food will be outrageously high in cost and scarce to boot, and there will be MANY people out of work.</p>
<p>The best thing this nation can do right now is pull back in defensive mode and prepare for the worst.  Bragging about the population increasing is the work of fools, especially since there are more unskilled jobless peons to take care of at the present time than we can handle, and things are going to get MUCH more austere.</p>
<p>My advise to Mexicans is to go home.  There will be nothing here that you will be able to rely on, but starvation.  Go home and breed there. </p>

****************************************</p>
<p>First off, NO we are NOT in it together. Get that through your head.</p>
<p>As for Whites (whom he means, of course) below their replacement level, I wonder why that is Mr. Pimentel? Whites are the ones PAYING the taxes to support all you people, which I can agree is insanity. They cannot afford to have 5,6 or more kids like we use to. We are paying for ALL nonwhites in this country to reproduce. We have to have enough income to move out of neighborhoods and whole cities to get away from what comes when hispanics/blacks move in. We don&rsquo;t get free jobs (AA) like all you people do. We don&rsquo;t get free schooling (taxes again) or college grants.</p>
<p>One more thing, I KNOW Whites are even afraid to bring in more White babies because they see the fruitless future those White babies will have in this multiracial America. So you Mexicans keep reproducing and when the White taxpayers are all gone, good luck with your New &#8220;Mexico&#8221;. Only now YOU will be paying for all the blacks, not us.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty universal phenomenon that the less successful minorities are outbreeding the white majority - be it the United States, Britain or Australia - and they are largely supported by the taxes paid by the majority. The real problems will become evident when the white taxpayers are a minority and will not be sufficiently wealthy or numerous to support the less competent minorities. </p>

<p>I often hear from the usual overpaid pundits and opinion makers that America has an advantage over moribund European countries because of our higher birth rate.  The fools are utterly unconcerned about who it is that is having the babies.<br>

<p>We&rsquo;re not in this together.  You want to advance your people and at our expense, too.  Whites used to have large families until we let the so-called civil rights crowd and anti-white powers-that-be control our lives, raise our taxes and make it harder for whites to not only have more than two kids, but now we have to pay higher real estate prices to get away from you people.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real easy to gloat about you hispanics &#8216;having more babies&rsquo; when you don&rsquo;t have to pay for them and when most of your are too short sighted to see that there won&rsquo;t be enough white taxpayers to foot the bill much longer.</p>

In Russia the Muslims, most of whom are not Slavs, are having lots of babies. It&rsquo;s the &#8220;White&#8221; Russians who aren&rsquo;t and they&rsquo;re the ones whom the government is begging to proliferate.</p>

		<p>All I can say is the California of my youth was paradise. 15 million mostly highly educated Whites. Free universities, best public schools in the country. Unemployment below 3%.. Compared to now 35 million people, worst public schools, gangs, outflow of productive Whites.</p>
<p>I do not know what this idiot is talking about. We already have the model of the disaster of California. I believe that if we do not turn around this invasion from the south, we are finished. Period. <br>
Can you imagine California in thirty years at this rate.</p>

 <br>
When I read this, I laughed out loud. <br>
 <br>
Until the Great Recession, and to an extent even now, the people of Europe, and North East Asia were enjoying the highest standard of living in those countries&rsquo; history. A major reason was the decline in the birth rate. <br>
 <br>
Even when the population and the standard of living go up during the same time, like they did in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s, the standard of living would go up even faster without population growth. <br>
 <br>
One can express the relationship between population and standard of living with the following equation:<br>
 <br>
(technology x natural resources) / population = standard of living <br>
 <br>
More people mean less of everything good to go around. It is actually just that simple. </p>

		<p><i>A young population and too much fertility can spell failure.</i></p>
<p>Hispanics, an unskilled, uneducated, low IQ population spells nothing but failure and disaster.</p>
<p><i>This being the case, I&rsquo;ve had trouble getting my arms around how unwelcome Latinos.</i></p>
<p>Let me help you get your arms around a few things about why Latinos are unwelcome.</p>
<p>1.  50% use some form or welfare.</p>
<p>2.  19 times more likely to be in gangs than whites.</p>
<p>3.  50% high school drop out rate</p>
<p>4.  High crime rates, 3 times that of whites.</p>
<p>5.  Low IQs.</p>
<p>There is no reason to desire such a population to increase.  </p>
<p><i>Thank a fertile Latino.</i></p>
<p>Thank fertile Latinos for having children they cannot support?  Thank fertile Latinos for birthing drunk drivers and fatherless boys to feed the prison and gangs?  Never.</p>

<p>Where did you get that from?! You assume that caucas muslims in Russia are having lots of kids because muslims do it in some other muslim counries?<br>

		<p>What this guy is writing is stupid because he doesn&rsquo;t know that Mexico birth rate is now almost the same as that of US and is dropping much faster than american. The same is already happening among latinos in US. The birth rate among US non-latino whites is also not as low as people think. It is for sure much highier than in Russia. Birth rates among russian muslims are the same as for rest of russians. Some muslim countries( like Algeria, Tunisia or Iran ) have nowadays birth rates below european level and they don&rsquo;t reproduce themselves. People tend to think with outdated stereotypes.</p>

		<p>Here is the problem that so many of these third worlders don&rsquo;t understand:</p>
<p>They move to the US, Canada, or Europe to get away from their native hellholes and to a better way of life, a way of life that a group of people very different than their own built. They then demand to have more of their people come to the first world country. But once a critical mass of their people arrive, the land they came to because it was nicer than their native land and offered better opportunities, gets turned into a northern version of their old land, which was what they were trying to get away from in the first place!</p>

		<p> The group that most amazes me are the blacks. The Latinos will out reproduce  them and have zero guilt to prey upon. When they are the majority they will and have demonstrated no regard for blacks and will push them into their own enclaves to starve to death.<br>
 They will take over the cities and being a black guy will mean unemployed and really desperate. Their leaders are so eaten up with hatred and greed that they are urging their own dispossession.</p>
