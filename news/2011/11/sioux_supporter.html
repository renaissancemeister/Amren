			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chronicle of Higher Education, November 2, 20111</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Sioux Indians who support the University of North Dakota&rsquo;s use of the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in federal district court in Fargo, N.D., asserting that the association&rsquo;s efforts to have the controversial logo retired by year&rsquo;s end &#8220;violate Native American civil rights, equal-protection rights, and religious rights,&#8221; reports The Pioneer, a newspaper in Bemidji, Minn. The State Board of Higher Education, which voted in August to have the university remove the nickname by December 31, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that the lawsuit would not affect that plan. State lawmakers, in a special session next week, are expected to repeal a bill that required the university to keep the nickname.</p>

		<p>I remember back in the 80s and 90s when many Indian tribes wanted colleges and such to stop using indian-themed logos.</p>
<p>I wondered about that because I thought it was a great way to get people to remember that you (indians) exist and have status.</p>
<p>We have funny white caricatures for teams such as the vikings, pirates or other things, and no white people complain it makes us look bad.</p>
<p>Now at least some indians realize that by removing the indian-themed logos, they will fall further off the radar of the public, almost erased!</p>
<p>Well, white liberals know what&rsquo;s best for you!  Obey the social justice crowd!</p>

		<p>I am glad this tribe is fighting to keep the name.  Having a sports team use your name is a compliment.  It has never been clear to me why it would be offensive.  I am from the Appalachian South, and have noticed no team names itself the &#8220;Fighting Hillbillies&#8221;.  </p>
<p>I have asked a Creek lady and an older Cherokee gentleman I know and neither is offended by the use of Indian names for teams.  They take it as a compliment, just like &#8220;Vikings&#8221;, fierce, brave etc.  </p>

<p>They figured out they are being <b>e-raced</b> in favor of the black.</p>
<p>There is and never has been anything wrong with an American Indian mascots &hellip;.. there just is no revered black group image that anyone would want applied as a mascot to a school &hellip;. so no &#8220;competing&#8221; group may have their image lauded.</p>

<p>(Note - Wikipedia claims that &#8220;the team added the phrase &#8220;Fighting the use of Native American stereotypes&#8221; to its merchandise to discourage the shirts from being worn by white supremacists, and arranged for <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/fightinwhite" rel="nofollow">CafePress.com</a> to handle manufacturing and sales of the clothing.[9]&#8221; Not as of the day I wrote this, they haven&rsquo;t.)</p>

I would take it for compliment if anybody would call their teams as &#8220;crazy Turks&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>When is the diversity crowd going to complain about the &#8220;Fighting Irish&#8221; of Notre Dame? </p>
<p>&#8220;All this drinking, violence, destruction of property&hellip; are these the things that we think of when we think of the Irish?&#8221; (Kent Brockman - The Simpsons  - Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment Episode)</p>

<p>Untrue, pure nonsense.  Remember that almost all the founding fathers were Masons.  You must be a Christian to go into the higher degrees, and FM is all about building oneself into a higher moral character.  Same goes for the Jews, that&rsquo;s why many have traditionally been doctors and lawyers, and traditionally obsess over appeasing God.  Why would either group, that have had members high ranking founding roles in founding Western societies and supporting it, wish to see it&rsquo;s back broken.  Is it that you mourn the ending of the Inquisition, persecution of European Jews who played such a critical role in Europe&rsquo;s rise from the Dark Ages?  There is simply no factual, reasonable basis for such a statement as yours.</p>

		<p>I think they tried to take on &#8220;The Fighting Irish&#8221; of Notre Dame once because it stereotyped the Irish as pugnacious. Guess they found out the stereotype was true and left them alone.</p>
<p>Since the custom of taking a mascot name is an attempt to suggest a likeness between the team and its mascot, you will never encounter a team that calls itself the &#8220;Hamsters&#8221; or the &#8220;Butterflies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless there are third parties with big bucks driving the NCAA agenda (always a possibility), the inescapable conclusion is that those who would deny a team its name would deny the team its IDENTITY. Why would they want to do that? Simple. Because they can; and since all aspects of life, to the Leftists, is a class struggle, they must exert their power over whomever they can, in this case, innocuous athletic teams. And since the Left&rsquo;s agenda cannot win elections, there is no one or nothing remaining but the dog to go home and wage jihad against. Pretty small, wouldn&rsquo;t you think? George Will calls it &#8220;Chief among the silliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, may the next Trail of Tears be for Leftist liberals.<br/>
