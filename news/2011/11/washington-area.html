<h1><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/2011/11/06/gIQAeYImtM_story.html">Washington-Area Schools Confront the &#8216;Gifted Gap&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Sieff, Washington Post, November 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The budding scholars in Alexandria&rsquo;s gifted classes are bright and curious enough to make any teacher beam, but these days they&rsquo;re also an emblem of what the school system calls one of its greatest failures: a lack of diversity among the academic elite.</p>
<p>Most of the city&rsquo;s students are black or Hispanic. Most in gifted programs are white.</p>
<p>This imbalance in classes tailored to gifted and talented students is echoed across the region and the nation, a source of embarrassment to many educators.</p>
<p>In theory, a racial enrollment gap in gifted programs should be easier for schools to close than a racial achievement gap. But in practice, experts say, there are many obstacles. Among them, they say, are testing and outreach methods that fail to ensure children from all backgrounds get an equal shot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Alexandria is debating how to diversify gifted classes without sacrificing rigor. That pursuit could raise questions such as how intelligence is measured and the function of a program catering to the academic elite. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In recent decades, local school agencies and state and federal governments have wrestled with how to define gifted students. Intelligence tests have been tweaked. The referral process in many districts has changed. But many gifted classes remain stacked with white and Asian students.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a national problem,&#8221; said Joyce VanTassel-Baska, an education professor at the College of William and Mary, &#8220;and in some districts it&rsquo;s extremely hard to make progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among local school systems, Prince William County&rsquo;s has taken perhaps the most aggressive policy on diversity in gifted classes. It mandates that the demographic composition of the gifted program reflect the overall racial and ethnic makeup of the school system. To do that, Prince William has amended its identification process to ensure that it finds gifted students from a variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Fairfax County system and others in Northern Virginia have started an enrichment program that targets high-achieving minority students.</p>
<p>{snip} Still, Fairfax&rsquo;s gifted program is overwhelmingly white and Asian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In nearly every local system, white students are disproportionately represented, even though most gifted programs explicitly target students with natural talents and aptitude, which are spread evenly across racial groups and social classes.</p>

		<p>Do the designers of these idiotic programs realize the depths of their idiocy?  If 100 kids take an arithmetic test do we throw the test out because the white kids can add the best and the back kids can not add at all?  Just let the giant meteor hit and start over for goodness sake!</p>

		<p>I suppose they are going to do the same for the white students when it comes to sports such as football or basketball? I am afraid that the white kids may be under represented and the black kids over represented. This wouldn&rsquo;t be very fair, now would it?</p>

		<p>Are gifted programs really necessary?  I never took any gifted classes.  My grades were Bs.  Yet I scored in the 778 verbal and 746 math SATs when the highest score was 800.</p>
<p>Especially now, when undergraduate programs are mostly a rehash of high school.  If the colleges just gave tests for liberal arts GE requirements, most Whites would pass with ease.  Then they could get a degree and start their adult lives at 19 or 20 instead of spending years and tens of thousands of dollars in marxist re education camps formerly known as universities.</p>

		<p>OK&hellip;let&rsquo;s parse the duckspeak out of this and see what&rsquo;s really happening here&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the city&rsquo;s students are black or Hispanic. Most in gifted programs are white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duckspeak:  White people are somehow responsible.</p>
<p>&#8220;This imbalance in classes tailored to gifted and talented students is echoed across the region and the nation, a source of embarrassment to many educators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duckspeak:  It&rsquo;s not just the white people in that district.  All white people are the problem across the country and world.  They should be ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among them, they say, are testing and outreach methods that fail to ensure children from all backgrounds get an equal shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duckspeak:  This is because white people are evil and discriminatory.  There is no other possible explanation, because such would be &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alexandria is debating how to diversify gifted classes without sacrificing rigor. That pursuit could raise questions such as how intelligence is measured and the function of a program catering to the academic elite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duckspeak:  Since blacks fail to achieve on IQ tests no matter HOW they are tweaked and adjusted, IQ must be a false concept since according to statistics, IQ is racist.  Must be bad measurement.  Can&rsquo;t be anything else.</p>
<p>Regardless, here&rsquo;s how this will play out&hellip;</p>
<p>White gifted kids will have to score X% higher than blacks and &#8220;minorities&#8221;, without, of course, any &#8220;outreach&#8221; program whatsoever, and under qualified minorities will be GIVEN their places.  The whites, through no fault of their own, will be forced to continue paying the opportunity cost racial jizya, will continue to outperform regardless&hellip;</p>
<p>And one day will find themselves paying for future fatherless blacks to continue degrading standards in the War on Merit known as Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Sickening.  There&rsquo;s a reckoning coming though. Whites can no longer afford to countenance this civilization destroying garbage.  Whites can no longer afford to pay for millions of black bastards and millions of incompetent black set asides.  And looking at the horrible economic prospects of our young people of ALL shades&hellip;</p>
<p>Something has to break&hellip;</p>
<p>Affirmative Action is not only the War on Merit - it&rsquo;s just one of the ways White people are targeted for genocide - often by their own Lysenkoist dupe fellows&hellip;</p>

		<p>Just another reason to homeschool. One of two things will happen, they will either dumb the requirements down so that more blacks and Hispanics will be able to get in or deserving Whites and Asians will be denied places in order to have the proper racial mix. If the problem really is lack of &#8220;outreach&#8221; to the minority population to have kids tested then that is pretty easy to remedy. I dont think this is really the problem. Lower average IQ, poor motivation and lack of parental involvement are the biggest reasons for the gap. If blacks would get over the idea that academic success is somehow &#8220;acting white&#8221; more black kids might be interested in gifted classes. At least they are not getting rid of the classes all together- it is usually gifted kids  </p>

<p>Raucous, long, loud laughter on the sound track.  What are the natural talents of the blacks?  According to continuing education for teachers, it is &#8220;energy&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can just imagine what these gifted programs are like, just more and more anti White indoctrination, dorky field trips and station activities.  Spend those college funds on a Subway Franchise and a few business courses at the local community college.</p>
<p>What with anti White discrimination mandated by both our genocidal goverment and employers, why should Whites even go to college, grad school, scramble for internships, print out hundreds of resumes and agonize over the exact shade of blue shirt or lipstick to wear to the interview, when a small business will earn our children a good living?</p>
<p>The living will be especially good if we Whites adjust to immigrant diverse business and tax practices.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a cosmetics problem for the public schools, and treated as such   &mdash;  - rather like elite U. S. universities that use radically different admissions standards based on race to produce cosmetically desirable diversity.</p>
<p>But even if gifted children were properly identified at the K-8 levels, the odds of of a particular gifted child being taught by an equally gifted teacher are infinitesimally low. See:</p>

		<p>This makes no sense. Absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>These &#8220;educators&#8221; must be the dumbest people on the planet - next to the black children they are trying to educate.</p>
<p>First, who cares? Say you have a gifted math program and to be in the program one has to achieve &#8220;x&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221; - be they tests scores or entry exams&hellip;So, give the exams and parse the applicants and move on. End of story. If no blacks make it - well, too bad. Maybe next year. Maybe never. It&rsquo;s not anyone&rsquo;s fault - so proceed and help the gifted become more gifted.</p>
<p>This simply shifts the focus. It&rsquo;s no longer about gifted programs - it&rsquo;s about black people. </p>
<p>I think on some strange level the teachers - who are either brainwashed whites or clueless blacks - actually believe every student is equal in ability. Thus, if they - the teachers - do their job, all students will do well. If not, they blame themselves. </p>
<p>Perhaps, in 1957, you could - at a stretch - say that was a possibility. Now, 50 years and two generations later, only a total moron would not be able to see the problem is with the disparity in student intelligence. </p>
<p>The low scores of blacks have been repeated time and time and time again in place after place after place. How ignorant does one have to be not to figure out that, gee, perhaps blacks simply aren&rsquo;t as smart as whites.</p>
<p>The tragedy is that the &#8220;gifted&#8221; programs will now morph into dressed-up special-ed programs. Everyone suffers - and society suffers the most.</p>
<p>This is complete insanity.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s like putting 30 monkeys in a room with brand new computers and calculators and the very best educators and then wondering why, after two months, the monkeys cannot do calculus and the classroom is in a shambles.</p>
<p>Every white parent must do two things, at a minimum. One - keep your kids as far away from blacks in school as possible. Two - home school or private school if it comes down to it.</p>
<p>Blacks haven&rsquo;t totally destroyed American public education - part of that honor goes to the grossly incompetent, ideologically-driven, and perhaps mentally ill teachers and administrators who perpetuate this fraud on the public and themselves.</p>

		<p>I agree with Neanderthal DNA - behind all the intellectual and pseudo-sophisticated language, those of European descent are now being openly targeted. Just as U.S. and European History has been rewritten to cause whites to be guilty for the &#8220;crimes of their ancestors&#8221; instead of being proud of the Western Civilization they come from, so now whites are being attacked just for being white. What right do whites have to achieve at higher levels than blacks and Hispanics according to the perverted logic of these specialists in Education?</p>
<p>A day of reckoning definitely is coming, and it will take place when enough fed up whites finally say &#8220;enough is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the most breathtakingly ignorant things I have ever seen so boldly stated. If people with equal &#8220;talents and aptitude&#8221; were&#8221;spread evenly across&#8221; racial groups, why can&rsquo;t a single school district, even one of the increasing number of ones controlled by non-Whites, close these pesky gaps?</p>

		<p>WHAT A LAUGH!!!</p>
<p>Reminds me of my years spent teaching with the Los Angeles Unified School District. I went from teaching &#8220;Honors&#8221; classes to &#8220;Gifted&#8221; classes to &#8220;Gifted and Talented Education&#8221; (GATE)</p>
<p>Gifted AND TALENTED??!!!</p>
<p>What an unholy crock of you-know-what THAT was!</p>
<p>If little Tamiqua couldn&rsquo;t spell &#8220;cat&#8221; but she could jump around to jungle music or recite the first few lines of &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; or sing the latest (C)rap hit from the radio, she was in. Because, God knows, she was the absolute equivalent of any white or asian student who could discuss at length thermodynamics or rocketry or brain surgery.</p>

<p>Blacks are good at basketball.  Whites and Asians are good at nation building and stuff like that.  This is a problem for leftists and minority rabble-rousers.   Nothing can be done but to cheat.  Drop standards down or just eliminate the gifted program altogether.  Leftists are famously pro nature and science, but when nature offends their liberal sensibilities they rebel and bang their head against it screaming into the wind.  </p>

		<p>Sureesh - Lets see those countries open their doors to white immigration; after all, we are the ones who developed most of the modern medical and technical innovation. The fact is, we whites are a distinct minority on the face of this planet. The world is abound with Indians and Chinese.

		<p>   I&rsquo;ve begun to have a change of mind concerning education.  As the public funds for education begin to get scarce (as will public funds for all services), it becomes important to direct those funds to where they will provide the most return.  In other words, we should spend the most public education monies on students who will be the most likely to get high paying jobs as a result of their public education.  This is completely different from the current educational policy that has every student have as much public resources as needed for them to reach a minimum level of education.<br>
  If Jewish, Chinese, and upper-middle class EuroAmerican kids show the greatest result in job (and life) achievement for any given amount of educational public funds spent per student, then MOST of the available public funds for education should be spent on the schools that these children attend.  And students who show gifted-level abilities should have proportionately more funds directed at them than students who have no interest at all in school.  (I was one of them).<br>
  For students who have no interest at all in school (but are not disruptive) there should be extensive vocational training programs.  Electronics, Small Business management, cars, music production, whatever&hellip;  If they can excell in non-academic areas, then they too should have public funds directed towards their vocational training.<br>
  We need &#8216;more bang for the buck&rsquo;, instead of &#8216;pay whatever it takes to make everybody bang&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of stories in the past few months about the gifted (intelligence) gap.  I think they&rsquo;re in panic mode.  Colorado recently voted down a small tax increase which would have gone to school budgets.  A good sign.  Sureesh, you should go home and use your high IQ to help your country improve sanitation, public health, nutrition.  Such a superior people should not live in filth as so many of your countrymen do.  Such a superior people should be able to improve food production so that so many would not have to eat rats.  Such a superior people should know by now that simple things like soap and (clean) water can do so much to fight the spread of disease.        </p>

		<p>I am so sick of this crap! You just cannot fairly legislate &#8216;equality&rsquo; as it will always unfairly punish an individual with greater &#8216;equality&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is obvious to most normal folk that academic performance depends on many factors. In my opinion the main factor is nurture (surroundings, upbringing and wealth) followed by IQ and race (somewhat intertwined). </p>
<p>To answer Dan and Sureesh. It is pretty much a fact that legal employment-petitioned immigrants come into the US with high qualifications and IQ&rsquo;s, tend to be from high IQ wealthy families and therefore perform higher than average (i.e. Asians and Indians; I have yet to meet a poor, by family background, Asian, Iranian, Saudi, Nepalese or Indian or even African immigrant grad student. I sincerely doubt that an individual of average background would be afforded the opportunity to emigrate to the west). Indeed Sureesh commented on Silicon Valley, an area filled with high IQ immigrants and also with your average Joe folk of the US - it is like comparing the IQ of the average Cambridge attendee (the supposed best of the UK and world) with that of the local population.</p>
<p>Back on topic, I am not so sure that the failure of blacks to achieve academic success is due to IQ, and while their overall IQ may be lower, the difference does not match the rate at which they are utterly failing academically. I mean, come on, the SATS are not exactly hard compared to say A-levels of 20 years ago! My thoughts on this are that the black community have systematically been led to failure through handouts (leading to poor responsibility/family structure), affirmative action (no real incentive to achieve) and by their being held aloft as perpetual victims (entitlement, victim-hood is never a good place to reside). Thanks Democrats?</p>
<p>It seems to me that efforts to legislate &#8216;equality&rsquo; are not well founded and it injures both parties.</p>
<p>I am an AmRen lurking Asst. Prof. of Something, Chemist by training, Physicist by some reckoning and somewhat an Engineer by research. I cannot vote yet, but am looking forward to the day I do vote Elephant or something alternative. Had a long few months at work, so my post is kind of all over.</p>

It should only be a source of embarrassment to those who maintain, despite all evidence, that the races are intrinsically equal. Because these cannot find evidence for their dogma they try to control the discussion by punishing those who say in public what nearly everyone knows to be true.  </p>

An affirmative action policy for gifted classes will interfere with the purpose of the classes in the first place. The purpose is to make it possible for superior students to advance at their own speed without being held behind by slower students. </p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t news. Schools are destroying our chance to compete in the world with this diversity nonsense by dumbing down the curriculum and giving unfair advantages to pretty much anyone that isnt white. </p>
<p>The community college I attended offered all kinds of perks to anyone who wasnt white. There were special groups on campus that only allowed minorites in and if that wasnt insulting enough these groups got to register early. Classes I desperately needed were filled before I even had a chance to register. My future wasnt as important as the African American woman with 3 kids from 3 different fathers. </p>
<p>No matter though. I had less of a problem registering as I moved higher up in mathematics.</p>
<p><br>
Minorities don&rsquo;t want equality, they want special treatment. Too bad no one will stand up and say there is nothing special about them and if they want to get ahead they have to work hard like everyone else.</p>

<p>I am.</p>
<p>Once I understood that blacks are dumb, the bewildering interactions I had with them at last became intelligible. </p>
<p>Of course there are happy exceptions, and I&rsquo;m afraid that when I meet one, I stare at him with a silly grin on my face while I enjoy the seeming incongruity of his speaking intelligently.</p>
<p>But I agree with peejay that many of them have an acute emotional intelligence, at least about some things&hellip;they can especially be very alert and perceptive to any discomforts you feel that give them pleasure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old now and I&rsquo;ve had enough of them. I just don&rsquo;t care for them anymore.</p>
<p>And you can hypothesize about other factors than IQ that contribute to their low performance, such as their subcultural &#8220;don&rsquo;t-act-like-whitey&#8221; attitudes, etc., but I assume that much of that is also the result of low IQ.</p>

		<p>Good social policy can be based on premises that have nothing to do with scientific truth. The premise that is supposed to undergird all of our social policy, the founders&rsquo; assertion of an unalienable right to liberty, is not a falsifiable hypothesis. But specific policies based on premises that conflict with scientific truths about human beings tend not to work. Often they do harm.</p>
<p>One such premise is that the distribution of innate abilities and propensities is the same across different groups. <br>

		<p><i>Thank God I got out before LAUSD fell! I&rsquo;m just collecting my pension and waiting for the Big Bang.</i></p>
<p>Or maybe a meteor.</p>
<p>Hope you are diversified.</p>
<p>The Big Bang will come when STRS (California teachers retirement system) runs out of money.</p>
<p>When the economy tanked, CalSTRS&rsquo; portfolio dropped 25 percent. Combined with enhanced benefits, the system now has a humongous gap between its promises and income, or <b>$40.5 billion in unfunded liabilities.</b> </p>
<p>And, as you know, California teachers do not pay into SS, and despite common belief (because I keep reading and hearing this) California teachers do not collect 90% of our salaries when we retire, retirement  averages ~ 55 percent to 60 percent of salary.</p>
<p><i>Do the designers of these idiotic programs realize the depths of their idiocy? If 100 kids take an arithmetic test do we throw the test out because the white kids can add the best and the back kids can not add at all? Just let the giant meteor hit and start over for goodness sake!</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Istvan</p>
<p>Yes.  The tests are thrown out and  re-centered or re-normed which is edu-speak for dumbed down.  Meteor?  We should be so lucky.</p>
<p><i>Are gifted programs really necessary?</i> </p>
<p>Yes.  Otherwise bright students are held back, bored and used as tutors. Do you think AP Physics and AP Calculus should be eliminated?  This is what my local school board has proposed   &mdash;   to put more emphasis on raising the &#8220;literacy&#8221; skills of those with 85- 90 IQs.  The &#8220;cream&#8221; does not rise to the top as prospective teachers are told in ed school.  High IQd children are roundly ignored by the educational system PRECISELY because they are White and Asian.</p>
<p>Why should high IQ White kids have to put up with this? Many don&rsquo;t and drop out or turn to drugs, sick and tired of a stupid system which does not meet their needs or ignores them   &mdash;   and, in fact, debases them while honoring and glorifying non-Whites.  </p>
<p><i>I think on some strange level the teachers - who are either brainwashed whites or clueless blacks - actually believe every student is equal in ability.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know one White teacher who believes this.  BUT in the PC- enforced Reign of Terror that has taken over the US education, the entrenched dogma is:  &#8220;All Students have Equal Aptitude.&#8221;  <b>NO OTHER DOCTRINE IS ALLOWED.</b></p>
<p>Speaking out is heresy.  Remember what happened to Galileo?</p>
<p>Until the educational system is wrested away from the lefties who have taken  over and destroyed it, this is the way it is.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to catch a ride out of the solar system on that meteor.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the big lie all &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is based on, and it&rsquo;s absurd on its face. No one has ever been able to demonstrate this notion to be true, nor provide a plausible explanation for why it should be true. How come kinky hair, blue eyes, broad noses, epicanthic folds, pale skin, and countless other traits are not &#8220;spread evenly across racial groups&#8221;? Why would we expect &#8220;natural talents and aptitude&#8221; to be exempt from the law of natural selection? <br>

<p>Sureesh says the gifted are 70% Asian, 30% White. He forget to tell you that the schools here in Silicon Valley are not more than 30% White. Asians have flooded the valley in the last 20 years as the Whites are still moving out. Here in Sunnyvale, I see mostly Indians on the street. Thousands and thousands more are arriving every year. Eventually there will be no Whites living here. On my street, just me and two other houses are white. </p>
<p>Interesting - in India, you have to be Indian to work there. In Silicon Valley you have to have an H1B (Indian) to work here - at least in high tech. </p>

<p>You are so right.  My son has a tested IQ of 95.  He managed to get into and graduate from the &#8220;gifted and talented&#8221; magnet school in a separate building on his high school campus.</p>
<p>Rigth before his senior year, we had to transfer to a big city.  We rented in an all White neighborhood.  A few miles away there was a black neighborhood.  The students of the neighborhood high school were about half black.  </p>
<p>I figured he was a big strong boy who had taken maritial arts and would be able to endure for a year to graduate.  He loved playing basketball with the blacks, but he couldn&rsquo;t stand the noise of the blacks screeching all day.</p>
<p>He managed to get into the &#8220;gifted and talented&#8221; seperate section of the school.  The building was across the athletic field from the main buildings, so the screeching was muted.  They could still hear the blacks noise.</p>
<p>He did not work hard, do much homework or have a tutor.  I can only conclude that that &#8220;gifted and talented&#8221; magnet school was geared to normally behaved slower students who would have been in the C track in a normal high school.</p>

<p>That is liberal propaganda that black low achievement is caused by poverty and single mothers.  The poorest state, White W. Virginia has higher SAT scores than the average black score.</p>
<p>National Review and other magazines have published findings that Whites with family incomes under $10,000 per year consistently score 300 points higher on a scale of 800 points being the highest than blacks with family incomes over &70,000 per year.</p>
<p>Wealth, upbringing and surroundings have nothing to do with it. My family income was below the welfare benefit for a family our size.</p>
<p>My Mother was nuts and created chaos.  6 screaming kids in a small house with a nutso Mother doesn&rsquo;t help anyone. Dad went to work every day, but he was drunk from 6/pm every night and all weekend. Physical abuse from him and emotional abuse from Mom.</p>
<p>Yet at the end of third grade my reading level was 9th grade and math 7th grade, even though I had never taken math higher than 3rd grade.  End of 4th grade 12th grade reading and 9th grade math.</p>
<p>Our IQs were tested in first grade.  IQs ranged from 107 to 136.<br>
Despite the poverty and chaos, our grades reflected our IQs.</p>

		<p>Re this issue:  I&rsquo;ve worked inside &#8220;the sausage factory&#8221;  &mdash;  i.e.,<br>
in a measurement role to a gifted program serving a school district 35% Black.  When you resort to race specific norms, you get into &#8220;funny numbers&#8221; (the sort of thing that&rsquo;d send you to the slammer if you were dealing with products  rather than with children in a school system ).  Back in the mid-70&rsquo;s a sociologist developed a program of innovative measurement known as SOMPA that permitted &#8220;adjustments&#8221; to Black IQ scores.  In reality, in a gifted program,a span of, say, 12-15 IQ points typically shows up again and again in the social interactions.  The Black kids &#8220;boosted&#8221; in a wayPAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS  were finding themselves missing the point among the other gifted kids/ not catching the verbal quips/ etc.  This is not necessarily awkward or damaging among emotionally robust and socially connected students, but it is not especially rewarding to the many who are not so robust or connected.  SOMPA was a wash out.  But the early 80&rsquo;s the SOMPA kits in most school systems were gathering dust.  The US Army also tried race specific norms for the AFGCT when the Army went &#8220;all volunteer&#8221;<br>
in the 70&rsquo;s.  It was a disaster.  Again, something PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS had a boomerang effect.  The Army back peddled and started using common norms  &mdash;  color blind normative data  &mdash;  and<br>
racial harmony improved.   With an overall IQ norm of about 85, 25% of Blacks are at or below the older standard for mental retardation  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s one in four, folks.  When you try to slip a 115 IQ Black student into a gifted program that has generally the low level Mensa standard for admission, they knock over too many of the low hurdles.  Same in the Army within the left side of the bell curve.   </p>

		<p>why is it a problem that gifted students are caucasian and asian?<br>
{In recent decades, local school agencies and state and federal governments have wrestled with how to define gifted students. Intelligence tests have been tweaked. The referral process in many districts has changed. But many gifted classes remain stacked with white and Asian students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a national problem,&rdquo; said Joyce VanTassel-Baska, an education professor at the College of William and Mary, &ldquo;and in some districts it&rsquo;s extremely hard to make progress.&rdquo;}</p>
<p>tat sounds like an anti-white sentiment to me. but t won&rsquo;t be called &#8220;raysis&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Do the designers of these idiotic programs realize the depths of their idiocy? If 100 kids take an arithmetic test do we throw the test out because the white kids can add the best and the back kids can not add at all? Just let the giant meteor hit and start over for goodness sake!&#8221;</p>
<p> &mdash; Istvan</p>
<p>Yes. The tests are thrown out and re-centered or re-normed which is edu-speak for dumbed down. Meteor? We should be so lucky.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>Bon is so right.  This is done on what is left of the civil service tests as well.  The foreign service exam highest score is 100. Passing is 70.  </p>
<p>Whites who achieve test scores of 90 and above have 25-30 points subtracted from their score so that they fail.  It is called dichotomous averaging of raw scores to achieve adjusted scores that ensure equality of ethnic means.</p>
<p>When I took the San Francisco Police exam the exam was structured so that people WHO COULD NOT READ could take it.  Instead of written questions and answers, the exam was visual.</p>
<p>They would show a little film of a crime.  Then a tape would come on.  &#8220;If the man with the gun had a beard fill in the circle in front of letter D.  If the clerk wore a red smock fill in the circle in front of letter B. If the lady whose purse was snatched was black fill in letter A, if she was White fill in the letter B&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole thing was like that.</p>
<p>According to a friend who became a Lieutenant before affirmative action, it really did not matter what the answers were.  Women and minorities, preferably black women were scored highest. Almost all the women who came in with that test were black when the black population of the city was only 11 percent AND the police were already 14 percent black.</p>
<p>The first woman police chief of San Francisco was an affirmative action trifecta, asian, lesbian and handicapped.  She never in all her years passed her fire arms tests.  She was 20 pounds underweight for the height weight standards.  With her weight and handicap she would never been accepted on to the police academy.</p>
<p>Like women fire fighters, women like these are often given promotions far above their capability because they can&rsquo;t pass the firearms training or function as partol officers and detectives who occasionally have to get physical during arrests.</p>
<p>So they get their silly little internet masters in criminal justice administration and end up captains and deputy chiefs while the White men spend their lives in patrol if they are lucky enough to get pass the affirmative action barriers.</p>
<p>The Judge who ordered that test was White male, Italian last name.  Traitor,traitor, traitor.</p>
<p>Goverment administration master&rsquo;s degrees are different from master&rsquo;s in business administration in that there is absolutely no math, no statistics, no economics, nothing that would strain their low IQ brains.</p>

<p>I for one welcome Sureesh and as many others like him who might want to come here.  They&rsquo;re the only thing keeping the national IQ near 100.</p>
<p>Central and East Asians, especially those of the second generation, become good citizens and major contributors to our society.  Their crime rate is all but nil, they work hard, and their biggest crime seems to be that they increase competition for good jobs.  Would AmRenners prefer losing population ground to our black African brethren?</p>
<p>I must confess a long-standing affection and admiration for Asians.  I&rsquo;m a former US Army Special Forces captain who spent a lot of time working with South Vietnamese SF personnel and various Montagnard tribesmen. They make fast and loyal friends and terrible enemies. </p>

<p>That is not what I said &hellip; I was talking about society as a whole and not making excuses for blacks.</p>
<p>It is far more likely that you will find someone from a good background (not just $) with a low IQ in med school than someone of higher IQ who was dealt a poor hand. I cannot tell you how many folk I know who were tutored and trained to pass Oxbridge STEP entrance exams and coached for the interviews. Of course, there are exceptions to the general scheme of things, that despite circumstances, get through like you and I. I came from a chaotic background, spent some years in care, missed a lot of school and had many placements; I am fairly sure I would have achieved a lot more academically had I not had to deal with some results of my early years (depression, finances and then some).</p>
<p>What I do believe is that you cannot legislate equality; it is not fair to those who plan ahead for their children and it is not fair to those who succeed despite circumstance. I truly believe that the black community has been handed a victim status and no impetus to try and that this is the liberal problem of interference. The black community would have done so much better without government legislation and provision, despite the lower IQ.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to answer the question, &#8220;Why do smart Chinese, Indians, Japanese, etc. have to come here instead of fixing their own countries?&#8221;  It&rsquo;s because bringing the world&rsquo;s smartest people together in one place (e.g. Silicon Valley) maximizes their utility.</p>
<p>Obviously, bringing all the world&rsquo;s coal to Newcastle or all the world&rsquo;s corn to Iowa would *minimize* their utility.  But smart people are much happier and more productive in the company of other smart people, and the countries able to attract smart people become much wealthier.</p>
<p>Smart people further enhance their utility by paying others to cook their food and clean their houses.  Everybody wins, until the &#8220;others&#8221; discover they can *vote* for money instead of working for it.  As their Smartopia devolves into an overtaxed hellhole, the smart people scatter.</p>

<p>Obviously you do not have children and grand children with high IQs, high math, spatial relations and mechanical ability who will never be able to become engineers or computer programmers because of goverment affirmative action orders and employer preference for lower wage indentured H-b visa workers whose families are happy to live 15 people in a 1,800 sq ft house.</p>
<p>A major, major reason Seattle, Silicon valley, Boston and other tech industry areas are filled with indians and asians is that they are non White.</p>
<p>When the EEOC, civil rights for all but Whites division of the justice department, NOW, LARAZA, Sharpton, Jackson and the hundreds of anti White foundations armed with billions of dollars of tax evasion money start their lawsuits, the employers can defend themselves by pointing out that their companies have more asians than Whites and thus fulfill the goverment diktat<br>
&#8220;Hire no White Men&#8221;.</p>
<p>As long as the companies have few White men on the payroll, our anti White  goverment is satisfied.</p>
<p>The asians and indians are no more smart and capable than the White men who invented and developed those industries.</p>
<p>Employers have no choice in hiring.  Hire non Whites or be fined, sued and driven out of business or overseas.</p>
<p>I got married and moved to Mountain View with my first husband as soon as he got his areonautical engineering MS degree in 1964.<br>
The young men were White, the middleaged men were White.</p>
<p>They invented and developed the entire industry.  He was lucky that he had 28 years in and a pension when he was forced out<br>
at age 53 because all the companies and NASA were forced to hire non Whites by our goverment and the threat of lawsuits.</p>
<p>The companies turned to asia and india rather than the black ghettoes for their affirmative action employees.</p>

<p>&hellip;East Asians, especially those of the second generation, become good citizens and major contributors to our society. Their crime rate is all but nil,</p>
<p>East asians do not compete equally with Whites for jobs.  They are preferred affirmative action minorities, just like blacks and hispanics.</p>
<p>John, east asian immigrants committ the largest amount of White collar crime and medical insurance fraud.  Their businesses are mostly extortion of other asian businesses, sweatshops, slave trading, massage parlors, illegal gambling and the shylock lending, that goes with it, human trafficking and other non violent crimes.</p>
<p>I worked for Glendale Federal Savings bank and investigated a typical chinese fraud.  In California, real estate can be purchased using what is called a deed of trust.  It is a document stating that the buyer owns a piece of real estate with a certain value, mortgage and equity.</p>
<p>The equity is the no cash down payment on the new piece of property.  There are trust companies that issue these documents that are legal documents. That means they are like a state ID, they are not false, they are accepted as true.</p>
<p>An older chinese woman bought a 2.4 million dollar apartment house, no cash down.  The down payment was a deed of trust on another piece of property. A few years later she bought another apartment house for 1.8 million with another deed of trust.</p>
<p>After a few years she gave the apartment houses to her brothers as a family gift.  The payments stopped so we forclosed.</p>
<p>We uncovered a horrendous fraud.  The trust company that issued the deeds of trust that were used to buy 4 million dollars of real estate with no money down issued thousands of deeds of trust on non existent property.</p>
<p>This chinese family came to this country and set up the trust company with the intention of issuing false deeds of trust.  They issued thousands of them. Chinese crooks purchased hundreds of buildings for no money down with these deeds of trust.</p>
<p>The way the family was caught was that they did not realize that mortgages are on the real estate, not a personal debt.  They thought that by transferring ownership from the sister to the brothers the sister would be liable for the mortgages instead of the new owners.</p>
<p>They were charged and arrested, quickly bailed and disappeared.  We later found out that all their identities were false as well.<br>
Meanwhile, thousands of the fake deeds of trust were sold to the corrupt chinese community.</p>
<p>There are not that many vacant lots and goverment owned lots in S. California.  Some of those fake deeds of trust are on property owned by innocent people who will someday find out that <br>
some crooked, corrupt chinese immigrant has a deed of trust claiming that the crook owns their property.</p>
<p>Asian drs are infamous for diagnosing false disability so asians can get SSI and welfare.  Asian drs are infamous for medical fraud, especially in goverment programs such as medicare and medi-caid.  They come to this country and get affirmative action placement in medical school so they can defraud our goverment health systems.</p>
<p>Asian drs write prescriptions for wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds and other medical equipment to asians who have no need of these things.  The prescriptions are taken to an asian relatives medical supply store. The item remains in the store.  The store is paid by medicare and medicaid.  The asians profit.  The White taxpayer pays.</p>
<p>Asian businesses pay no personal or business income tax.  They don&rsquo;t pay into unemployment, social security or any other payroll taxes. Their elders work full time while getting SSI and other welfare benefits for the elderly and disabled.  Many of these elders are 10 years younger than their birth certificates and passports state so they can get SSI.</p>
<p>You John, worked for 30 or 40 years under social security.  What do you get per month? 1,300? 1,500?  Those asians who have never worked a day under social security get $900.00 per month social security along with food stamps, free meals on wheels, senior housing, free transport, and all sorts of social services.</p>
<p>In S. California  virtually all goverment subsidy senior housing is filled with asians.  The Whites who worked 40 years and paid taxes are banned from those buildings because they are White and by goverment order not entitled to goverment senior housing.</p>
<p>I suggest you google asian medical fraud. Last week there was a post about a 140 million dollar medical fraud in New York.  I doubt that 140 million dollar fraud just enriched the chinese immigrant drs.  It must have gone straight to the chinese goverment.</p>
<p>This post is too long, I&rsquo;ll write another about the korean landlord of a friend soon.</p>
