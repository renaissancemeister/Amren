<p>Mr. Buckley is one of tens of thousands of once solidly middle-class African-American government workers-bus drivers in Chicago, police officers and firefighters in Cleveland, nurses and doctors in Florida-who have been laid off since the recession ended in June 2009. Such job losses have blunted gains made in employment and wealth during the previous decade and undermined the stability of neighborhoods where there are now fewer black professionals who own homes or who get up every morning to go to work.</p>
<p>{snip} About one in five black workers have public-sector jobs, and African-American workers are one-third more likely than white ones to be employed in the public sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reliance on these jobs has provided African-Americans a path upward,&#8221; said Robert H. Zieger, emeritus professor of history at the University of Florida, and the author of a book on race and labor. &#8220;But it is also a vulnerability.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jobless rates among blacks have consistently been about double those of whites. In October, the black unemployment rate was 15.1 percent, compared with 8 percent for whites. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The central role played by government employment in black communities is hard to overstate. African-Americans in the public sector earn 25 percent more than other black workers, and the jobs have long been regarded as respectable, stable work for college graduates, allowing many to buy homes, send children to private colleges and achieve other markers of middle-class life that were otherwise closed to them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But during the past year, while the private sector has added 1.6 million jobs, state and local governments have shed at least 142,000 positions, according to the Labor Department. Those losses are in addition to 200,000 public-sector jobs lost in 2010 and more than 500,000 since the start of the recession.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The layoffs are not expected to end any time soon. The United States Postal Service, where about 25 percent of employees are black, is considering eliminating 220,000 positions in order to stay solvent, and areas with large black populations-from urban Detroit to rural Jefferson County, Miss.-are struggling with budget problems that could also lead to mass layoffs.</p>
