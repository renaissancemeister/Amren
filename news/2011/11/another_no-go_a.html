			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Melanie Phillips, Daily Mail (London), October 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Earlier this year in the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest and Newham, posters suddenly sprouted in the streets declaring: &#8216;You are entering a Sharia controlled zone. Islamic rules enforced.&rsquo; Underneath were images indicating that smoking, alcohol and music were banned. Also this year posters declaring Tower Hamlets a &#8216;gay-free zone&rsquo; were put up across the borough. Police and local councillors declared that they would take all such posters down.</p>
<p>Now, however, it seems that the threatening implications of self-declared &#8216;Muslim areas&rsquo; are spreading into the heart of our democracy.</p>
<p>Last Friday Mike Freer, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, was forced to abandon his constituency surgery at the North Finchley mosque and hide in a locked part of the building when a group of activists from the &#8216;Muslims against Crusades&rsquo; group forced their way in. The Daily Mail reported that Mr Freer, a gay man and a member of Conservative Friends of Israel, said he was called a &#8216;Jewish homosexual pig&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr Freer said he only realised that the danger he was in possibly went beyond such abuse when was he made aware that ahead of this incident the group had posted up a reference to the attack last year on East Ham MP StephenTimms, who was stabbed by a Muslim woman while he too was holding a constituency surgery. This message warned</p>
<blockquote>&#8216;the attack on Mr Timms should serve as a &#8220;piercing reminder&#8221; to politicians that &#8220;their presence is no longer welcome in any Muslim area&#8221;&rsquo;.</blockquote>
<p>The message also stated that</p>
<blockquote>&#8216;&#8220;as a member of the Conservative Party&#8221;, Mr Freer &#8220;has the blood of thousands of Muslims on his hands&#8221;.&rsquo;</blockquote>
<p>Mr Freer, who also happens to be a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Islamophobia (the ironies attending politically-correct ideology are rich indeed) was apparently targeted because he had demanded that Palestinian extremist Sheikh Raed Salah be banned from Britain earlier this year.</p>
<p>Understandably, Mr Freer now wants the Home Office to investigate &#8216;Muslims against Crusades&rsquo;. But rather more pertinently, shouldn&rsquo;t some arrests have been made? For by any standards this was threatening behaviour which intimidated an MP into being unable to carry out his constituency duties.</p>
<p>Effectively, therefore, the North Finchley mosque became a no-go area for this MP. This surely represented not only a threat to Mr Freer as an individual but to parliamentary democracy itself. More chilling still, it would seem that for &#8216;Muslims Against Crusades&rsquo; Finchley is now to be regarded as a Muslim area  &mdash;  presumably on the grounds that any area with a sizeable Muslim population is to be thus regarded  &mdash;   and its inhabitants subjected as a result to Islamist intimidation.</p>
<p>Finchley happens to be home to a significant Jewish community which will now feel particularly vulnerable. But in fact everyone now comes under potential threat  &mdash;  including Muslims themselves  &mdash;  as can be seen from what has taken place in east London.</p>
<p>For the posters there did not represent empty threats. The process of Islamisation through intimidation is well under way.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, four Tower Hamlets Muslims were jailed for at least 19 years for attacking a local white teacher who gave religious studies lessons to Muslim girls. An Asian woman  &mdash;  not a practising Muslim  &mdash;  who worked in a pharmacy was threatened with her life unless she wore a headscarf or veil. And as Andrew Gilligan has reported,many more such Islamist attacks are taking place  &mdash;  which he claims the police are downplaying for fear of being accused of racism:</p>
<blockquote>&#8216;The Sunday Telegraph has uncovered more than a dozen other cases in Tower Hamlets where both Muslims and non-Muslims have been threatened or beaten for behaviour deemed to breach fundamentalist &#8220;Islamic norms.&#8221;
<p>&#8216;One victim, Mohammed Monzur Rahman, said he was left partially blind and with a dislocated shoulder after being attacked by a mob in Cannon Street Road, Shadwell, for smoking during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan last year.</p>
<p>&rsquo; &hellip;  Teachers in several local schools have told The Sunday Telegraph that they feel &#8220;under pressure&#8221; from local Muslim extremists, who have mounted campaigns through both parents and pupils  &mdash;  and, in one case, through another teacher  &mdash;  to enforce the compulsory wearing of the veil for Muslim girls.</p>
<p> &rsquo; &hellip;  Tower Hamlets&rsquo; gay community has become a particular target of extremists. Homophobic crimes in the borough have risen by 80 per cent since 2007/8, and by 21 per cent over the last year, a period when there was a slight drop in London as a whole.&rsquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>Such reports are  &mdash;  to put it mildly  &mdash;  deeply disturbing. Yet from the &#8216;progressive&rsquo; chattering class and the politicians (embattled Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick being a notable exception with his stark warning that Islamists wanting to create an &#8220;Islamic social and political order&#8221; in Britain have infiltrated the Labour party), the response has been &hellip; silence.</p>
<p>Thus  &mdash;  unless the UK ruling class gets its act together pretty damn quick  &mdash;  the Islamists will win.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You are entering a Sharia controlled zone. Islamic rules enforced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juxtapose this against another of today&rsquo;s AmRen articles, which describes how the U.S. Circuit Court has banned the use of the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; in the public setting.  I&rsquo;d like to see the court try to enforce a similar ban in London against Muslims. Yeah, right.<br>

They got that right. Perhaps they should have contacted Tony Blair and ask him to explain again how this wonderful diversity was such a great thing for Britain. Perhaps he thinks he is above it all, but unless they make some major changes, his grandchildren will pay the price for his foolishness, and when Muslims completely take over London, THEY will not be above it all.</p>

		<p>Things are heading towards implosion. EU economy is in shambles. The pretty much inevitable Greek default and the resulting bank crisis could still be contained (if at considerable expense of money and political effort), but the resulting economic uncertainty would be very painful for especially Southern Europe&hellip; And if the big unstable nations of Spain and Italy fall, then all bets are off. With the financial systems of Europe and USA still so entangled, the resulting economic tsunami would certainly cross the Atlantic as well, just in the other direction than 2008 shockwave. Might not be the worst of times to get that gun.</p>
<p>Even at the best, nations like UK will have a hard time funding the bread and circuses that keep the minorities relatively quiescent. If the worst comes to pass, huge cutouts have to be made, hitting most painfully those depending on welfare, public sector jobs, and state-subsidized NGOs. The fact that cutbacks were planned in the various generous bribes which UK had been handling out may have already been a significant factor in the riot wave of this summer. In addition to weakening the power of British state to bribe, it will also weaken its power to enforce its rule (not that it really has the will to use what it has to full extent). So in addition to criminals enraged at the withdrawal of what they thought as their entitlements, the nation may also see Islamist radicals ready to move into the expanding power vacuum.</p>
<p>In the short term this will be absolutely horrid. Still, it may be better to have the situation blow up now, when the demographics still favour natives and all the really important levers of power are in their hands, rather than mutely witness things degrading a bit by bit every year.</p>

		<p>I am against Muslim immigration, but I actually like those rules that are listed on the sign. Imagine: no drunk drivers, no deafening gangsta rap, no smoking, no drugs. I support such safe zones. If they would leave unveiled white women alone, I would have no problem with those rules. The problem is, unveiled white women are being raped in droves by Muslims. Also whites and others are commonly brutally bullied and assaulted in these areas. Smoke free, rap free zones are fine with me&hellip;it&rsquo;s the rape and murder that bothers me. </p>

		<p>Stop fighting US colonial wars and bring the Royal Army home.  Use that military power to round up the non-Europeans.  Keep RAF planes and Royal Navy ships at the ready and ship&rsquo;em all home.  It would be ugly but the short term mess would be worth the long term peace.  Future generations of Brits would say &#8220;that was their finest hour&#8221;.</p>

		<p>What is happening in England and other western democracies is beyond belief!</p>
<p>It is incomprehensible!</p>
<p>There are only two ways to explain what the politicians are doing.</p>
<p>Either they are being paid off to be traitors or they are being threatened with their own or their family members deaths.</p>
<p>And the fact that women are not offended and revolting by the implementation of sharia in a democratic state is really most baffling!</p>
<p>It is like the world of reason is turned totally upside down.</p>
<p>A good analogy of events would be if the guards are voluntarily letting the inmates out and going voluntarily going into the prison cells and letting the inmates free.</p>
<p>It defies absolutely all logic.</p>

One has to admire the backbone of these people if not their specific &#8220;laws&#8221;.<br>
 However, since I lean heavily to the Libertarian politically, I would not necessarily embrace those prohibitions.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a real dilemma for the British Labour Party.<br>
On the one hand its most favored pet and biggest voting bloc, Pakistani muslims are turning on other cherished and priveleged pets, namely gays and women.<br>
 In the final analysis Labour will side with the muslims, you see in the poker game of hierarchal privelege they trmp everything else - apart from blacks that is.</p>

<p>3rd world Muslim societies are not safe, clean, moral, stable societies. The only time NW Muslims behave and don&rsquo;t rape our women is when there are no White western people around to be raped and it isn&rsquo;t so much a difference in culture, education, laws - it&rsquo;s simply a difference in people - these NW Muslim hordes from hell can never be appeased - at best they can be contained in existing countries, continents. When the White West gave the Arab Muslims all of French Algeria - that didn&rsquo;t satisfy the NW Muslim mobs, they insisted on flooding in to France proper because, well life was someone better in France and they insist it is &#8220;racist&#8221; when we don&rsquo;t share everything including our women with them.</p>
<p>Stop trying to understand the dark ugly Muslim mobs in places like Tower Hamlet London or Malvo Sweden - I understand these NW Muslim mobs very well thank you and understand that they have to go - we have to do on to them, what they did on to our kinsmen the French Pied Noir in 1965: offer them the coffin or the suitcase.</p>

<p>Not just no gangsta rap, no music or concerts of any kind. As for no alcohol or drugs, unless enforced without utmost brutality and intrusiveness those rules mean about as much as Prohibition did in USA (drug use is rife amongst UK Pakistani youth). And yes, the rules most definitely apply to everyone. That&rsquo;s precisely the point of having an universal, divinely sanctioned legal code. Maybe you could try to weasel out some concessions by referring to the practice of &#8220;dhimmi&#8221;, but only if you like to live your life as a third-class citizen always looking over your shoulder and paying protection money in addition to taxes.</p>
<p>There are worse fates, worse places, but frankly not too many.</p>

		<p>Islamophobia? I shake my head in amazement every time I hear that word. Another doctrine invented by the PC do-gooders. As if being afraid of a &#8220;religion&#8221; that condones &#8220;piercings&#8221; of those they disagree with and blows others up in the name of their god is somehow irrational! No need to worry about the rapes of infidel women by Islamist either I suppose.   How much longer are you going to tolerate this type of terrorism in the name of Allah UK?</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Stop trying to understand the dark ugly Muslim mobs in places like Tower Hamlet London or Malvo Sweden - I understand these NW Muslim mobs very well thank you and understand that they have to go - we have to do on to them, what they did on to our kinsmen the French Pied Noir in 1965: offer them the coffin or the suitcase.&#8221;</i></p>

		<p>I guess the best thing that could ahppen now, is actually a third world war.</p>
<p>A war effort would relaunch Western economies. And the so-called Muslim civilization could be destroyed. African Blacks would be left to starve or be killed by pandemics.</p>
