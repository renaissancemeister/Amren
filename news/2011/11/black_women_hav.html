<p><em>Allure</em> magazine polled 2,000 men and women from across the country in an attempt to find out &#8220;what&rsquo;s beautiful now.&#8221; </p>
<p>And when African American women were asked about their personal attractiveness, &#8220;they were three times as likely as Caucasian women to rate themselves at the &#8216;hot&rsquo; end of the spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beverly Bond, founder of &#8220;Black Girls Rock,&#8221; is trying to plant the seed of self-confidence early. Her organization helps create, reaffirm and/or reclaim that self-worth in young girls across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want our young girls to be inspired to not settle for being less than their best selves,&#8221; Bond told the Associated Press. &#8220;I want them to feel proud of who they are and who they can be and who we have been.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I see: all that purported &#8220;racism&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t affect black womens&rsquo; self-esteem to the extent that they don&rsquo;t have a good self-image - in fact, they have a superior body image.  It just prevents them from making the effort to get a good education, marry, have children in wedlock, raise those children without public assistance, have a work ethic or one of abiding by the law.  My, my, isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racism&#8221; selective in its effects!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not confidence.  It&rsquo;s as I said many times before:  It&rsquo;s black arrogance&hellip;.based in stupidity.  They&rsquo;re blind to their own short comings and so are the men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noted often how they crow when they do the least little thing right or advance in something even though the move was the result of AA&hellip;and strictly AA, in order to have a token black face.</p>
<p>Look at Herman Cain right now.  He was awarded a CEO position in order to have a black represented among the corporate greed mongers, but he&rsquo;s so arrogant he perceives that he advanced on his own ability.</p>
<p>This inborn arrogance has convinced him he&rsquo;s presidential material even though he has always exhibited a mediocre mentality.</p>
<p>Arrogance is not confidence, but it can be dangerous.  Take them down a notch or two and show them what a paper figure they are and they&rsquo;re ready to kill.</p>
<p>Blacks fall in love with themselves easier than any other race on earth.</p>

<p>Says it all right there. Implanting delusional thinking. Self esteem is EARNED not given out like candy on Halloween.</p>
<p>Most black women I have seen are arrogant and loud, have false delusions about their &#8220;beauty&#8221; even the most obese of black women think they are &#8220;hot&#8221;. </p>
<p>Whites are more realistic and tend to deny their sexiness or appeal. I have known beautiful White girls that do not even know they are beautiful and who do not find that being so, is not a recipe for happiness or success. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.</p>

		<p>An abundance of self confidence can be termed &#8216;wonderful&rsquo; or it can be called narcissism.  Most criminals actually don&rsquo;t suffer from self esteem issues at all.  Like these wonderfully empowered black women, they esteem themselves highly, all evidence to the contrary be damned.</p>

		<p>I see a lot of black women who are a svelte 250 pounds  &mdash;   they squeeze themselves into a dress, force on some pumps and waddle down the street feeling &#8220;hot&#8221;. But I&rsquo;m also certain that the standards they have and the ones this white boy has couldn&rsquo;t be further apart. &#8220;Hot&#8221; definitely is a relative term in this case, but if it helps their self-esteem, it can&rsquo;t hurt I guess. What is weird is when the likes of a Queen Latifah becomes the standard for beauty. It&rsquo;s the same old double standard that applies to blacks.    </p>

		<p>Looks like black women fit the popular definition of clueless: &#8220;Seldom right, but never in doubt.&#8221; Judging by the black women you might see strolling down an urban street, the only way many of them are &#8220;hot&#8221; is because of all the extra weight they&rsquo;re carrying.</p>

		<p>Actually I worked with several slim, good-looking black women during the 1980s. But that was in my USAF days, and the service had strict weight policies that everyone had to follow, regardless of race or sex. (This was the pre-PC, pre-AA military, where the word &#8220;equal&#8221; meant exactly that.) Fast-forward to the present, and I find myself agreeing with the others here   &mdash;   seeing a sexy black woman is like being dealt four of a kind in a poker game. It&rsquo;s possible, but very rare.</p>

<p>Truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>And why among most blacks you never see any humility, grace, integrity or compassion. The more highly evolved human traits seem absent in the majority of any blacks that I have observed. Even when black mothers have a child killed, there never really seems to be any tears, just lots of screaming, yelling and flopping around. They make a scene, I think, just to make it look like they are grieving. Plus it brings the attention back to themselves.</p>

		<p>They feel that way because women with thick bodies and big bottoms are considered highly attractive in black cultures regardless of facial beauty or personality. This is why most interracial couples typically involve a plain overweight or obese White woman. Considering that 4 out of 5 Black women is overweight or obese, it&rsquo;s no wonder that they would see themselves as &#8220;hot&#8221; after all.  I have nothing against strong curvy women myself when they are smart and facially attractive, but this is just another example how different blacks are from the rest of humanity.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;they were three times as likely as Caucasian women to rate themselves at the &lsquo;hot&rsquo; end of the spectrum.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Maybe that is the problem. </p>
<p>-Although even black men are looking for white girls, black women think they are hot.<br>
-Although 70% of them don&rsquo;t know who their father his, they think they are reasonable.<br>
-Although every school and test shows their low IQ and discipline they think they are very intelligent.</p>
<p>And when reality doesn&rsquo;t fit with their thinking, the blame it on whites. Liberals thought (and think) if they would help blacks, they will be thankful and respectful and everybody can live together in peace.</p>
<p>But the truth is, after in Europe we helped them but letting them in, they call us names, rape our daughters, beat up our sons and invade our homes.</p>

		<p>Okay, I have to swim against the tide in this comment thread. But before I do, let me vehemently agree with everyone, from Satoshi Kanazawa to the commentators here, who affirm that black women are generally quite unattractive. That is simply a fact. No one finds them attractive, not white men and not black men.</p>
<p>BUT, it&rsquo;s appalling to see that the reaction to this news is largely, &#8220;Black women should feel just as ashamed of themselves as white women,&#8221; instead of what it should be, which is, &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t white women have a little more confidence in themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>The flip side of all of this &#8220;obesity&#8221; talk is that white women are easy prey for the diet industry, the exercise industry, the cosmetics industry, the plastic surgery industry, and every other industry that makes money off of making women (white women) feel horrible about their appearance.</p>
<p>That this fact leads many white women towards eating disorders like anorexia and towards paying plastic surgeons to butcher them is bad enough.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s even worse is that it makes them dupes for the ideology behind these feel-bad industries. In her book &#8220;Spin Sisters,&#8221; a former editor of one of the women&rsquo;s magazines admits that all of these industries couple the selling of products with the promotion of a left-wing agenda that involves every aspect of cultural Marxism, from a gay agenda to an anti-white agenda to a socialist agenda, and so forth. Try picking up an issue of Glamour someday. It&rsquo;s ten steps to the left of Rachel Maddow and MSNBC.</p>
<p>So in other words, the low self-esteem among white women means (a) that they fork over their money (which as often as not means their husbands&rsquo; money) towards industries that are owned by our enemies (the propagators of cultural Marxism), and thus financially support the ideological dismantling of traditionalism, and (b) that they imbibe that cultural Marxism themselves and bring it into the home, foisting it on their children.</p>
<p>Perhaps if white women had a little MORE self-confidence, they wouldn&rsquo;t be such easy marks for these industries that sell them unhappiness (and sell them liberalism in the process).</p>
<p>Sure, black women&rsquo;s high self-esteem is unwarranted. But the real corrosive fact in this study is not that black women have too much self-esteem, but that women women have too little.</p>

		<p>The esteem of black women would ideally entail opinions of themselves as good parents and good citizens, not as hot mamas who get visited by ten ghetto studs per month.  Most low-IQ black girls apparently believe they&rsquo;re attractive and worthy simply because some oversexed male is willing to impregnate them at age 13.  <br>

<p>Many studies have been done whereby school age kids are given surveys which are supposed to measure their levels of &#8216;self-esteem&rsquo;.  Oddly enough, White kids who almost always do far better academically, who are almost always better behaved and well-mannered, who exhibit far more self-discipline than do the black kids in the same schools - will almost always score far lower on the &#8216;self-esteem&rsquo; chart than will those same black kids.   Black kids, on the other hand, are largely ineducable and thanks to integration of the public school system - have literally destroyed what were once the highest achieving, most respected around the world - public education system. </p>
<p>So, the question arises:  From whence do these incompetent, unruly, undisciplined, often times violent and disruptive, and generally very low IQ, academic failure oriented black kids get all their high &#8216;self-esteem&rsquo;?    It most certainly isn&rsquo;t a result of any &#8216;pride&rsquo; derived from being academically talented, because the vast majority aren&rsquo;t intellectually capable of performing up to White educational standards. Well, I have a theory about this mystery. </p>
<p>First, since the disaster of public school integration began - I think that the liberal left instinctively understood that there were going to be insurmountable racial differences in academic performance between whites and blacks (which there has been), and so they immediately began to (a) water down the school curriculum to make it less and less challenging and less complex, and (b) modify the new, simplified curriculum to emphasis methods design to artificially boost the self-esteem of black kids in order to make them feel good about themselves.  Bringing in &#8216;black studies&rsquo; programs is one example - whereby young and not very savvy black kids are being told that their race invented all sorts of amazing things, and by making sure that plenty of anti-white perniciousness is generously ladled on top of that largely phony propaganda to give them the idea that whites have been sneakily working to suppress and cheat the black geniuses out of most of the &#8216;credit&rsquo; that they should have received for the vast and unparalleled contributions that black Einsteins have given to the World.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, curriculims - and particularly in the area of American and European history - were revised and a massive anti-white Cultural Marxist oriented program was instituted and which has deliberately and with premeditated malice aforethought - been used to demonize White historical achievements, to smear and defame what were once considered White American or White European historical &#8216;heroes&rsquo; - and to push endless quantities of &#8216;White Guilt&rsquo;, &#8216;White Self-Loathing&rsquo; and to basically destroy the ability of young White children to be taught about the history of their ancestors  and have that history taught to them in a pride instilling fashion. <br>
 <br>
Therefore, it&rsquo;s my gut feeling that the combination of these two virulently anti-White tactics by the Cultural Marxist enemies of White European people have produced this bizarre and ludicrous reversal of normal human behavior between blacks and whites.   </p>
<p>The solution to this is for white parents to home school their children, at least in the area of American and European history.  If parents can get their hands on American history text books that were written before the Cultural Marxist takeover of our society in the mid-1960s, those books can be a valuable source of non-poisoned material and can be used for home schooling purposes.  <br>

		<p>I think what we are seeing here is a mischaracterization of the term &#8220;confidence&#8221;. Really confident people are often very low key and subdued. They know they have nothing to prove. This is usually the exact opposite of the loud, vulgar behaviour we find in &#8220;confident&#8221; blacks. The type of &#8220;confidence&#8221; we see in blacks is usually a mix of narcissism, arrogance and delusional thinking. A five year old kid might pick his nose in public and think nothing of it. But this is not &#8220;confidence&#8221; in defying social conventions. The child simply doesn&rsquo;t have the critical capacity to understand what he is doing is considered wrong. Still the findings don&rsquo;t surprise me. I worked with many blacks over the years and they all had views of themselves completely at odds with reality. All the black women I worked with were obese, some of them morbidly so, but they all believed they were &#8220;hot&#8221;. This one black guy was always broke, forever being chased by lending agencies he had stiffed, was as dumb as a bag of rocks, but he just thought the world of himself. I never met anyone with such a high opinion of himself and so little justification for it. </p>

		<p>To understand this (and a lot of why a lot of underclass minorities behave so badly), one needs to understand that self-confidence has two distinct factors. Can&rsquo;t recall the official terms, but they&rsquo;re basically the strength and durability of self-esteem. Basically, there are two very different types of high self-respect.</p>
<p>1) High strength, high durability. This kind of person thinks, actually knows deep down that he&rsquo;s hot stuff one way or another. Most of the times, this is correlated with actually being good in something and being treated with honest respect by others. Since the self-esteem of this person is so solid, he can, if he so chooses, to disregard insults. They don&rsquo;t present any threat to his self-esteem.</p>
<p>2) High strength, low durability. This kind of person also thinks he&rsquo;s hot stuff, but deep down he isn&rsquo;t really sure about it at all. This correlates with general incompetence and subsequent disrespect by others. Maybe those others try to hide their lack of respect, maybe they&rsquo;re genuinely afraid, and often the person tells himself that&rsquo;s respect, real validation of his high self-esteem. Still, human brain is very good at picking up subtle emotional cues, and even if those unwelcome pieces of information don&rsquo;t penetrate all the way up to consciousness, they&rsquo;ll build up on subconscious level. This contradiction between two mental models makes the self-esteem shaky, and easily threatened by insults or any perceived disrespect. Having your sense of self-worth rocked is rather hurtful, and it tends to trigger some defensive reflex. It can be something like labeling the offender &#8220;racist&#8221; or whatever turns him completely worthless know-nothing whose opinions can be safely disregarded. A lot of the time, the painful attack is taken like a punch in the gut, and it triggers seriously aggressive response. Growing up in underclass increases the prevalence of this strong-but-fragile combination (in a way love of yourself is one of the few things you have), and seriously increases the likelihood of violent response. You can call genuinely sexy woman ugly without much risk from anything worse than withering insults, and that only if she has a nasty character. Don&rsquo;t try this with some baleen woman from a ghetto, though.</p>
<p>This is the lot of most blacks in USA (Muslims in Europe too, for that matter). They hear from each other and some whites they&rsquo;re just as good, and actually morally superior because da white boy be raciss. Still, the state of black America is a everyday counterargument to that (and there are plenty of problems for which invoking racism is really stretching it), and just about everyone else regards them with either open distaste, avoidance or patronizing largesse. The last may be advantageous in many ways, but it&rsquo;s not very encouraging to have some liberal pat you on your back and soothingly murmur: &#8220;There there, boy, we all know you can&rsquo;t compete on equal terms with others, so let us help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So sure, in a way black America suffers from low self-esteem. It suffers from high self-esteem too. It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if it wasn&rsquo;t both.</p>

		<p>As a black person, I don&rsquo;t see it as delusional or low IQ as some of you say. I think that it all boils down to maintaining the self-esteem that is so fragile and valuable to black women, because the alternative is to face reality; which is to admit that black females may not be as &#8220;hot&#8221; as they perceive themselves to be. (Hence, self-hatred).</p>
<p>For the longest time, blacks have struggled to overcome this deep-seated feeling of inferiority that has been ingrained into their collective psyches. Blacks, particularly the females, will do whatever it takes to avoid that horrible feeling of worthlessness. If that means resorting to delusions of grandeur, then so be it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a solution to this dilemma, it&rsquo;s that blacks need to come to terms with who they really are, both physically and mentally. This is not to say that blacks are undesirable. It just means that &#8220;Black is Beautiful&#8221; in its own distinct way, while not demeaning the beauty of other racial groups. </p>
<p>A good amount of self-esteem is essential to every human being&rsquo;s mental health. But when that confidence grows out of proportion or borders on arrogance, that&rsquo;s when trouble arises. A regulated amount of self-confidence will help many, particularly black females, avoid the mental trap that is arrogance.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;ve copied both of your explanations into a text file and saved it.  I think I&rsquo;ll be needing them again in the near future.</p>
<p>For me, I don&rsquo;t think the answer is complicated.  Blacks have a naturally higher self-esteem, even if you don&rsquo;t artificially pump it up, because they have low IQs.  It&rsquo;s easy for low IQ people to feel good about themselves because they&rsquo;re unaware of their own deficiencies.  High IQ whites are aware of their shortcomings because of their high IQ, and therefore have a lower self-esteem &#8220;out of the box.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s also why the white suicide rate is higher.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity makes a valid point.  I often wonder, when I&rsquo;m around blacks (between 5-6 days a week) why they seem so utterly oblivious to everyone else around them and seem to have so little capacity for honest self-reflection.<br>
They also seem oblivious to how others view them.  They do seem to have a high opinion of themselves which no one but them shares.   </p>
<p>Regarding #40&rsquo;s comment: &#8220;I think that it all boils down to maintaining the self-esteem that is so fragile.&#8221;<br>
What a load of it. Anyone who&rsquo;s spent time with black women listening to them cackle and shout away LOUDLY, obnoxiously, rudely, without regard to anyone else around them, creating scenes in public, knows there&rsquo;s nothing fragile about them.    </p>

<p>Reply to Kwaku Minta:</p>

<p>That is very true. I used to work as a camp guide and helper with marginally retarded youngsters. They all exuded happiness and confidence and were never plagued by any self-doubt or angst. Unlike teens of normal intelligence, they never worried about acne, wearing braces, etc. They simply didn&rsquo;t have the capacity for this. I sometimes wondered if they weren&rsquo;t better off. Sometimes, you can have too much intelligence.</p>

		<p>I myself spent a lot of time in advanced science classes in college. The vast majority of my fellow students on a personal level were what you might call slightly neurotic. They are the exact opposite of Blacks. The average IQ was 130+. European Jews who are known for very high IQs are known for personal neurotic behavior. I also have noticed it in high IQ Gentiles. I agree with another poster who said it is a part of the brain that accounts for it. In other words the Blacks own stupidity tends to give them a sense of inflated ego! Talk about an irony!</p>

<p>Obviously, the high confidence has many reasons, but I do not believe it plausible to chalk it all up to naturally higher self-esteem or low IQ. Especially not since it has taken such distinctly overblown and grossly vulnerable form.</p>
<p>#43</p>
<p>Methinks the ladies doth protest too much, and on some level they know it. Now, mind you, &#8220;fragile&#8221; in this context doesn&rsquo;t mean something that can be easily broken. Just something that can be easily shaken and threatened, necessitating some kind of defensive behaviour (often blowing up and making a huge scene, or downright physical attack). Neither does having a high but fragile self-esteem mean one can&rsquo;t be massively egoistical.</p>

		<p>The fact is, blacks -as a rule- are not very introspective people. A Black introvert is a rarity. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know why this is so. I don&rsquo;t know also why black people are, generally, more &#8220;happy&#8221; than whites or Asians. <br>
Perhaps the entire luggage of culture, guilt, parental expectations, inquisitive intelligence, strict moral rules &hellip; does not exist for them.<br>
And then- suicide. Whites and Asians are suicidal to a rather high degree. American Indians/Native Americans too. Blacks- not. Why, I dunno.</p>
