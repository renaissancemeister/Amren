<h1>South Carolina Immigration Law Challenged by 16 Nations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, November 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Citing concerns for their citizens, sixteen nations from Latin America and the Caribbean have asked to join in the U.S. Justice Department&rsquo;s lawsuit against South Carolina&rsquo;s controversial law that aims to curb the number of undocumented immigrants in the state.</p>
<p>Mexico, Honduras, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and other countries filed papers Tuesday, asking to join the Justice Department&rsquo;s litigation in Charleston.</p>
<p>The law would require law officers who make a traffic stop to call federal immigration officials if they suspect someone is in the country illegally. Opponents say the measure would encourage racial profiling.</p>
<p>The 16 nations state in their filings that the law would lead to state-sanctioned discrimination against their citizens.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n said that Arizona&rsquo;s law  &mdash;  which has similar language to the one in South Carolina  &mdash;  was &#8220;discriminatory&#8221; and lawyers representing the nation filed a legal brief in support of one of five lawsuits challenging the law.</p>

		<p>Headline: Ineffective Mexican Laws Challenged by 16 US States</p>
<p>Citing concerns for US citizens who have been victims of illegal alien-related violence, sixteen states from the United States have filed a lawsuit against Mexico&rsquo;s controversial inability to curtail the number of illegal aliens coming across the border.</p>
<p>Texas, Arizona, South Carolina and other states filed papers Tuesday, asking to join the litigation in Mexico City.</p>
<p>The absence of enforced laws enables illegal aliens to pour across the US-Mexican border. Opponents say such incompetence encourages countless Mexicans to cross the border illegally.</p>
<p>The 16 states state in their filings that the lack of law enforcement leads to economic drains on American social services, the collapse of hospitals, an increase in crime and various other social problems that burden US citizens.</p>
<p>American president Barack Obama said that Mexico&rsquo;s lack of law enforcement &mdash; which has similar language to the lack of law enforcement in Nigeria &mdash; was &ldquo;incompetent&rdquo; and lawyers representing the nation filed a legal brief in support of one of five lawsuits challenging the lack of law enforcement.</p>

		<p>Why do alien nations think then have standing in our courts?  Oh, just after illegal aliens did.  <br>
Why wouldn&rsquo;t the leaders of those foreign nations assume they are protecting the best interests of their citizens here in the U.S.  We have laws and benefits that far exceed what those illegal aliens can get in their own country.  And they send some of that dough back to the mother country bolstering its economy.  </p>

		<p>Since when is it the business of a foreign power to dictate our laws?  And how is it &#8220;discrimination&#8221; when one of our states decides to remove persons from its midst who have no business being anywhere in America?  Any lingering doubts that the end game of Western Hemispheric Hispanic governments is Reconquista, a goal in which the Obama administration is fully complicit, ought to be erased by this article alone.  </p>

		<p>The United States should implement the immigration laws of Mexico. Those laws should be applied to citizens of Mexico and all other countries, with careful attention to finding immigrants from Mexico, Honduras, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and the other aggressors attacking American soveriegnty. These nations should be treated as criminal nations that have commited aggression against the soverignty of the United States of America and her citizens. The immigration QUISLINGS among Americans should be treated as the aggressors against American sovereignty that they are. We are dealing with organized crime here. </p>

		<p>What gave these countries the idea that they have a right to join the Justice Department&rsquo;s litigation in Charleston? Could it be the treasonous, criminal ways Obama and Holder have treated the citizens of our country? Under Mr. Fast &amp; Furious Holder the Justice Dept. will file suit against one of its own states but not prosecute the New Black Panther Party for intimidating white voters. He stinks. As does Obama with his fake birth certificate and fraudulent S.S. number. And our media is just as disgusting with their covering up of these and many other crimes.</p>
<p>Undocumented immigrants=ILLEGAL immigrants. The majority of Americans want them out of our country. And their countries of origin are worried about how they will be treated here? They&rsquo;re treated better here than where they came from. How about how they are treating MY fellow citizens? They steal our jobs, collect free handouts and commit crimes. If Americans went to Mexico, Honduras, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, etc. would we be able to find work? Could we go on welfare? NO! We&rsquo;ve been sold out by the greedy corporations and corrupt politicians looking to replace citizens with these third world invaders.</p>
<p>And third world they are. No American in their right mind would want to work or live in any of these countries listed. So they come here and turn this once great country into a stinking third world pit like the ones they left. All so our politicians have a dumbed down population they think they can get to vote for them. Headlines like this prove how far we have fallen as a nation. These countries are our enemies and are attacking the sovereignty of America. The &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221; are here illegally and need to be deported. Especially the criminals. And Holder and Obama should be tried for treason, along with some others I could name.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only explanation I can come up with is a rather troubling one:  The people leaving those countries and coming here are the types of people those countries want to get rid of.  Not exactly the &#8220;cream of the crop.&#8221;</p>

		<p>About 10 years ago, the Attorney General of South Carolina was Charlie Condon. One of the issues he pressed for was essentially a &#8220;Castle Doctrine&#8221; or &#8220;Stand your Ground&#8221; where homeowners would not have to worry about litigation and prosecution if they dispatched a criminal during a home invasion. The NAACP immediately raised Cain about this and ol&rsquo; Charlie released the figures on who was involved in these types of burglaries. There were relatively few white on white home invasion burglaries and almost no white on black burglaries. Virtually all were black on white or black on black. When AG Condon dropped this bombshell, the NAACP went ballistic. It was quite funny to watch. </p>
<p>I hope the current AG will tell these countries to go jump in a lake or say that the immigration policies of South Carolina will match those of (fill in the blank). </p>

		<p>This would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t so serious. If we had had a President in the last few decades who had the courage to step up and speak out,this would never have happened. How about going on worldwide TV and announcing that every country who joined this ridiculous lawsuit will henceforth and immediately have all financial aid cut. Oh, wait, we can&rsquo;t do that. Our own government is part of it by suing American states for trying to protect their own citizens.</p>

		<p>Why aren&rsquo;t USA citizens allowed to sue foreign countries that encourage massive illegal immigration to the USA? If a criminal illegal alien harms me or a family member, why can&rsquo;t i file a lawsuit against their home country? Also, all county hospitals should be able to sue foreign countries for treatment of foreign nationals as should school systems be reimbursed. where are our legions of lawyers?</p>

		<p>Imagine a mom who abuses, starves and mistreats her little boy.  Finally the child can&rsquo;t stand it anymore, runs away from home with his belongings tied up in a sack at the end of a stick, and he breaks into the Joneses&rsquo; house down the street.  At the Joneses&rsquo;, the kid gets three square meals a day and a bed to sleep on, which he sure didn&rsquo;t have at home.  But the Joneses keep telling the kid, &#8220;You know, you&rsquo;re not a Jones, and breaking and entering is a crime, and you really can&rsquo;t stay here forever.&#8221;  Whereupon, the kid&rsquo;s abusive mom sues the Joneses for not treating her son well enough.  That&rsquo;s about as ridiculous as what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>

		<p>Today is Veteran&rsquo;s Day.  Think of all the white men who were (and are) killed and maimed in all the wars fought (and being fought) to keep America free and sovereign.  And yet we are being taken over with nary a squeal.  And when we do attempt, in the most feeble manner, to retain some aspect of our independence we get sued in our own courts.  How do foreign governments have any standing?</p>
<p>We are not the world&rsquo;s first &#8220;world nation&#8221;, we are now a colony of the world.  They just haven&rsquo;t divied us up yet.</p>

		<p>Americans are slowly being eased into world government and eventual merger with Mexico and Canada.  It used to be considered insane &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; to talk about this but now Congress is pretty open about it.  The construction of the NAFTA superhighway from Mexico to Canada is well underway.  Americans will accept anything, anything.  It&rsquo;s disgusting.  This morning I was watching an interview with Abramoff and he stated that numerous members of Congress routinely engage in insider trading, making hundreds of thousands and laugh about it.  Is this what the founders had in mind?  I doubt it.  But when are Americans going to have had enough with these treasonous cultural Marxists who are hellbent on killing off the European traditions and the people who practice or used to practice these traditions?  Is Occupy Wall Street going to help?  They are all Antifa whackos with dreadlocks who are left leaning lunatics from the Marxist colleges in this country, and they have NO idea what they are angry about. </p>

		<p>Lance, Mexico is a &#8216;remittance&rsquo; nation. It is so broke that Mexican citizens have to come to America to get jobs to sustain themselves and their families back home. These mostly illegal aliens remit billions of dollars into Mexico which the government happily taxes. Meanwhile, Mexico is doing nothing to improve conditions that would make life worth living in country.</p>
<p>Of course, all of the Mexicans in the USA help with the reconquesta, Si!</p>
