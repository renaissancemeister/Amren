			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julianne Pepitone, CNN Money, November 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>How diverse are Silicon Valley&rsquo;s offices and executive suites? Activists have been trying for years to answer that question, but some of the industry&rsquo;s largest and most influential employers  &mdash;  including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook  &mdash;  closely guard that information.</p>
<p>Every U.S. company with more than 100 employees is required to file a one-page form each year with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), an independent federal agency. Called the EEO-1, the form categorizes U.S. workers by their race and gender.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blunt and imperfect measurement tool, but it&rsquo;s also the only hard data available for tracking the diversity of corporate America.</p>
<p>CNNMoney filed a Freedom of Information request in August seeking EEO-1 data from 20 companies: The tech industry&rsquo;s 10 biggest firms by annual sales and 10 smaller but influential firms, including Facebook and Twitter. The EEOC denied the request in full, saying it is legally prohibited from releasing that information. CNNMoney later filed the same request with the Department of Labor, and is awaiting a response.</p>
<p>We also asked all 20 companies to voluntarily release parts of their most recent EEO-1 report. Three companies agreed to do so: Dell, Ingram Micro (IM, Fortune 500) and Intel. (Click <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2011/11/09/technology/diversity_silicon_valley_data/index.htm?iid=EL">here</a> for a look at the data from each company.)</p>
<p>Intel (INTC, Fortune 500), which posts its workforce data annually on its website, reflects the tech industry&rsquo;s typical demographic skew: Its roster of nearly 44,000 U.S. workers is overwhelmingly male and mostly white.</p>
<p>Among American adults age 25 to 64  &mdash;  typically considered the working-age population  &mdash;  around 11% are African-American, but black workers account for just 3.5% of Intel&rsquo;s domestic workforce and 1.3% of its top officials. Hispanics are similarly under-represented: They make up nearly 15% of the American workforce, but only 8% of Intel&rsquo;s workforce and 3% of its management ranks.</p>
<p>In contrast, Asian workers  &mdash;  a category that includes those of Indian descent  &mdash;  have made strong inroads in the tech industry. They account for less than 5% of the U.S. working population but hold nearly 20% of the jobs at the companies CNNMoney surveyed.</p>
<p>Dell&rsquo;s (DELL, Fortune 500) data tells a similar story. More than 80% of the company&rsquo;s workforce is white or Asian. Dell&rsquo;s top management, which includes 137 executives, has no Hispanics and only one black official.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Microsoft refused to release its workforce demographic data. Sixteen other companies contacted repeatedly by CNNMoney also declined or ignored our request: Apple, Amazon, Cisco, eBay, Facebook, Google, Groupon, Hewlett-Packard, Hulu, IBM, LinkedIn, LivingSocial, Netflix, Twitter, Yelp and Zynga.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every company talks about their lovely diversity programs &hellip; but they won&rsquo;t give us their data,&#8221; says Aditi Mohapatra, senior sustainability analyst at Calvert Investments, which invests in socially responsible companies andc onducts its own diversity research. &#8220;What gets measured, gets managed. We need something tangible and public.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The companies try to make so many excuses,&#8221; says Yolanda Lewis, chief deputy of the Black Economic Council. &#8220;The &#8216;trade secrets&rsquo; defense is completely ridiculous, and in any case, how long can that be valid? Give us data from several years ago, then.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is shocking!  High-tech Silicon Valley industries have a disproportionate share of whites and Asians.</p>
<p>Funny, I&rsquo;ve noticed the same phenomenon in bio-research, medicine, engineering, chemistry, advanced manufacturing, aero-space, deep water drilling and extraction, all sorts of industries and occupations requiring backgrounds in math and the sciences.</p>
<p>This is doubly disturbing given the latest scientific and technical innovations coming out of Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. </p>
<p>This sounds like something EEOC can really get their teeth into.</p>

		<p>The problem is the tech firms hire on the basis of professional credentials and performance.  And it has been working, as it is one of the only true long term growth stories in the global economy.  Perhaps rather than telling tech firms how to behave, the government should look at how tech firms have prospered with a truly color-free hiring practice.  </p>

<p>Nothing much has changed since the development of the original Macintosh in 1984, except for the addition perhaps of a few more Indians and Asians.</p>

<p>The thing is, if you go to a technology conference, how many blacks do you see there? Only a handful, despite the fact that black usage of technology, such as video game systems and cell phones, is actually at a higher percentage than whites in some cases.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see even fewer blacks and hispanics at a programmer&rsquo;s conference.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a brilliant defense. If the percentage of nonwhites at a company is going to be used as a club against them to hamper their competitiveness, then by all means they should have a right to keep it a secret.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Seems massively too diverse already to me. Probably 99 percent of American workers qualified to work in a tech company would be white or Asian. Dell seems to already be paying a hefty diversity tax of having about paying 20 percent of its workforce to do pretend jobs but I am sure that won&rsquo;t deter shakedown artists from trying to extract their pound of flesh.<br>

		<p>These companies are highly labor intensive and extremely demanding with their employees. There is neither time nor room for anything that will diminish the effectiveness and efficiency that they take pride in and rely on. Without question, their customers are accustomed to competitive product quality and first-rate customer service. If minorities get in, they&rsquo;ll do want they please and expect special consideration/treatment. That, we all know. It won&rsquo;t matter if the job is done on time and correctly; the worry will be a lawsuit after lawsuit from those not promoted or fired. Women are even more insistent on having their way, from time off for the children and maternity leave, not to mention the strife and aggravation they seem bestow upon their fellow co-workers with trivial and petty nonsense. Let&rsquo;s face it; it&rsquo;s the white guys busting their butts, working in harmony  &mdash;  together with that team effort and spirit, and of course, rewarded with all that comes with the job. They aren&rsquo;t worry about things like race discrimination or sexual harassment. Mess up these innovative, aggressive and clockwork like industries, and we&rsquo;re all going to feel it big time.</p>

		<p>I worked in Silicon Valley for 3 years and I was the only white guy in my group and one of few whites in the entire company. There were no Blacks or Hispanics either. The clear majority was Indian with Orientals being second. The other whites were about half Eastern European immigrants and the other half were American born whites. Socially, people segregated by race but there was no racial tension. It was just that the Indians socialized with other Indians, Chinese immigrants with other Chinese immigrants, American born Chinese with other American born Chinese, Russians with other Russians, American-born whites with other American-born whites, etc.</p>
<p>IMO, the Indians were extremely bright but very cliquish. I did get one to open up to me and he admitted that Indian people are smart but corrupt in nature. They come to America where they can utilize their brains without being oppressed by their fellow Indians. I don&rsquo;t blame them and I have nothing against them personally, but I prefer working with fellow whites. Indians are good for America in small doses but they do best in a white run government. If you allow Indians to immigrate to the point where they make up a larger percentage and take over government positions, they will bring India&rsquo;s corruption here.</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t have to work very long in the technology industry of Silicon Valley to realize that race and culture are not barriers to employment.  The abilily to understand the technology and to do productive work for your employer is the primary path to getting and holding a job there.  Secondary considerations are English language comprehension and USA immigration status.  <br>
  Silicon Valley workplaces are really lively on the production floor because of WIDE mix of cultures and people.  There is more &#8216;diversity&rsquo; there than probably any other place in the world.  Engineer and designer office &#8216;cubicle farms&rsquo; are much quieter and formal in cultural interactions, but casual in dress and working modes.  Executive offices are probably more diverse than most places in the world because anyone in the world who enjoys working with technology wants to locate there and start a company.  All the smart people in the world who want to get really rich go instead to London or New York and work in the finance industry.<br>
  Engineers and engineering managers are really private in their personal relations and this extends to their management styles. Plus they believe that they are smarter than everyone else.  They really don&rsquo;t like non-teckies probing into their lairs and labs, expecially gub&rsquo;mint types.<br>
  If the diversity crowd were by some miracle actually able to force some form of &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; into high tech, the AA people would just be ignored by all the engineers and given nothing to do until they just all quit on their own.</p>

		<p>Many people above have correctly stated that blacks and Hispanics don&rsquo;t have the mental chops to work in SV.  There is one other reason they couldn&rsquo;t hack it   &mdash;   Software development is sometimes a 24-hour a day job.  You&rsquo;re on a mission, so you work until the mission is complete and your particular product goes gold.  I can ill imagine the typical black woman government bureaucrat who shows up an hour late, leaves an hour early for lunch, comes back from lunch an hour late, and goes home an hour early, and takes extra long coffee breaks, seriously contending in the grind of some SV startup where you&rsquo;re competing against five other startups exactly like yourself, slow down or slack off just a little bit and you&rsquo;re out of business by tomorrow.</p>

		<p>No fair using the general population population of blacks and Hispanics for comparison.  These are technical companies that require technical degrees.  Blacks and Hispanics are in the low single digits in higher education.  And thus their numbers should be no more than that on a strictly technical basis.  </p>

		<p>The few &#8220;whites&#8221; left in SV are mostly Russian Jews. I suspect the feds will still complain about there being too many whites long after there are zero. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll become the first race to go into negative numbers. Even then, the feds would not be happy.</p>

		<p>I think whites would do better in the competition with Asians if we were allowed to group together with other whites more often. As it is, all of our groups and institutions have been thoroughly transformed into multi-racial associations. As whites we are compromised in many ways and I think that reduces our achievements. </p>
<p>High achievement by Asians reflects high Asian enrollment in technology grad programs. The benefits of grad school are slanted toward Asians. That includes cheap labor for the universities. </p>

		<p>People have to remember that the Asian population is seriously augmented with the best and the brightest from Asia. India have sent their finest brains to Silicon Valley for over 30 years now. <br>
So I&rsquo;m surprised that the Asian population isn&rsquo;t 50 % or something. Shows that whites stack up quite nicely after all, since there is not the same rush at all to join SV in Europe or Australia for that matter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy like #7 to assume that just because you meet the 0,1 % of India in intellectual ability, you&rsquo;ve somehow met the average indian. India has an average IQ of about 85. But part of that is malnourishment. If that&rsquo;s fixed then you get to about 93 %. </p>
<p>The stereotype of the smart indian is not false; they&rsquo;ve been sending their best and brightest to America for decades now. But that elite group is not representative of the wider Indian population. If they were, india, not the UK, would have ruled the world ages ago. And they wouldn&rsquo;t have been conquered by the Aryans first and muslims second.</p>
<p>SV is, by the way, a total meritocracy. There are no racial barriers. People just get down to work and do what they want to do with whomever they want to do it with. </p>
<p>The rest of America should take heed of that</p>

		<p>The IT industry is one of the most meritocratic around, so it should not be too surprising that is made up of mostly Whites, East Asians and Indians.  I have White friends who owrk at Google and Microsoft and they told me the demographic realities.</p>

		<p>Zebras and antelopes have been excluded from not just the high-tech industries, but from medicine, law, mathematics, physics, and even the upper strata of the humanities.</p>
<p>The thing to do is to make a law mandating that zebras and antelopes will be allowed to work in all of these fields.</p>
<p>Once the law is passed, and enforced, then inevitably, we should see zebras and antelopes contributing to science, medicine, and scholarship in increasing numbers.</p>
<p>If the strategy works, we could also apply to kangaroos, chipmunks, and rhinoceroses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the above is no more illogical than the fundamental laws we live by today.</p>
<p>Without a recognition of the fundamental biological, genetic, evolved differences between different human subspecies, or races, no understanding of the world as possible.</p>
<p>These differences are readily observable, people knew about them thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Today, we have the advantage of genetics and other sophisticated techniques for surfing and quantifying racial difference.</p>
<p>Until we start using them, we will be like people wondering why there are no kangaroo mathematicians or otter physicists.</p>
<p>People descended from nonliterate communities have emphatically lower levels of cognitive ability compared to Eurasians.</p>

<p><i>For every dollar spent on regulatory enforcement [of AA], about twenty dollars is spent on compliance costs by the private sector. On average, a black worker between the ages of 25 and 64 earns an extra $9,400 a year because of affirmative action. Hispanics also benefit to the tune of almost $4,000 a year. However, being a zero-sum game, white workers pay an average of about $1,900 annually to foot the bill. </i></p>

<p>While I&rsquo;ve known very competent blacks in high tech positions such positions are naturally dominated by whites &amp; east Asians. If you consider the high IQs of high tech workers in general and look at the bell curve distributions of black and non-blacks, it is reasonable to expect no more than about 2% - 3%  of a high tech work force to be black if there is no pro-black racial discrimination (i.e., the counterproductive &#8220;affirmative action&#8221;), which of course there is. </p>

<p>The worst combo is a black woman. It is black women that EEOC has imposed on most workplaces.  It is ridiculous in public education.

		<p>Those and all other large companies in the country give billions per year to the liberal anti White foundations that lead the genocide.</p>
<p>If you look at the boards of directors and trustees of the liberal anti White foundations and the boards of the largest companies in the country, you will see the same names.</p>
<p>What goes around comes around.  The CEO&rsquo;s and boards of those companies funded the anti White lawsuits and judicial decrees.</p>
<p>I hope the EEOC does to them what it has done to education, civil service and every other entity it targeted.</p>
<p>Had the large companies funded anti affirmative action and anti school busing lawsuits the country might not have the problems it does.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If the diversity crowd were by some miracle actually able to force some form of &lsquo;affirmative action&rsquo; into high tech, the AA people would just be ignored by all the engineers and given nothing to do until they just all quit on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>No they wouldn&rsquo;t Simonetta.  The would stay their till retirement.  The hispanics and some of the White women would make themselves useful and be quiet.</p>
<p>The blacks would do what they always do.  Screech so loudly no one could hear.  Ever been in a cubicle office with just 7 or 8 blacks?  You can hardly hear. Babble on the phone all day.  Sexually harass the women who would file lawsuits.  Lie, connive, intrigue and cause all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>Speaking of Simonetta, why don&rsquo;t we make her and the other Botticelli and Fra Angelico girls our logo?  Not birth of venus but other pictures more clothed.  There is one Fra Angelico madonna in profile that is the most beautiful blonde in the world. </p>

		<p>Actually, blacks are NOT underrepresented in Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>In California as a whole blacks are just 6% of the population. I suspect that percentage is lower in the Santa Clara/San Mateo County region popularly considered &#8216;Silicon Valley.&rsquo; </p>
<p>And while the region does draw talent from around the world, a substantial portion of the industry is just made up of people from the region who work in tech because tech is what we do. </p>
<p>So is it a scandal that blacks represent &#8216;just&rsquo; 6% of the Silicon Valley workforce? No, that&rsquo;s ridiculous. </p>
<p>They comprise about 6% of the regions population. They&rsquo;re only underrepresented when compared to the national population, which is substantially blacker. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Every company talks about their lovely diversity programs &hellip; but they won&rsquo;t give us their data,&rdquo; says Aditi Mohapatra, senior sustainability analyst at Calvert Investments, which invests in socially responsible companies andc onducts its own diversity research. &ldquo;What gets measured, gets managed. We need something tangible and public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The condescending tone here, i.e., &#8220;lovely&#8221; is scary enough but the statement, &#8220;what gets measured, gets managed&#8221; is the scariest and most telling.  What&rsquo;s being said here is that BY GOD, once we get a hold of the data and it&rsquo;s there in print that the SV companies are overly white, we will BY GOD make them more brown and black.</p>
<p>This statement is blatant, uttered without any fear and probably any deep thought.  The emotionality of this Mohapatra person makes me cringe.  And the fact that CNN Money sees no problem with it and therefore published the comments is telling.</p>
<p>I previously knew about the EEOC&rsquo;s requirement of reporting the race of companies with 100 or more employees but I also find that fact very disturbing.  I thought skin color wasn&rsquo;t supposed to matter!</p>

<p>Ferocious fines.  Orders by judges that must be obeyed or the employers will end up in contempt of court and in jail.  There will also be lawsuits that would cost millions to defend and are guaranteed to lose because the judges of this country are determined to drive Whites out of all employment.</p>
<p>The justice department can and will find an employer for &#8220;discriminatory investigation&#8221; of  ID and social security number of an hispanic illegal alien. The fine is $375,000.<br>
Plus the DOJ will file a lawsuit for wages for the rest of the illegals life plus punitive damages.</p>
<p>The fine for hiring an illegal alien with fake ID is $3,000.  Only 2 or 3 employers a year are fined for hiring illegals with false ID.</p>

<p>India has ferocious affirmative action for the dalits, I think 50 percent in university admissions. Even without that, everything in India runs on family, religion, clan, tribe, region.</p>
<p>So the more intelligent ones come to America. There is unfortunately some pressure for them to become an affirmative action group.</p>
<p>Then we can look forward to our goverment importing all those 65 IQ affirmative action dalit Drs over here.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m in a graduate computer science program at a fairly competitive university (we rank somewhere between 12-15th in U.S.). </p>
<p>Overall the university claims to be something like 40-50% Asian, but in my program it&rsquo;s much higher. I&rsquo;d guess 80-85%, maybe even 90.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t say whether Indians outnumber Chinese (and a few from Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, etc.) but they definitely outnumber Americans. (These are mostly foreigners, not Asian Americans.) We also have a small number of whites from European countries and a few Middle Eastern. No blacks in any of my classes so far, and I&rsquo;ve met only one Mexican.</p>
<p>This is my first year and I feel like an outsider in my own country, on my own state campus. Of course we segregate; I can barely understand their heavy accents. I can&rsquo;t imagine how (or if) they passed TOEFL.</p>
<p>What struck me is that for all the talk of diversity, my all-white hometown on the East Coast had much more diversity. We came from places like Italy, Ireland, and Germany and, like me, many of us could rattle off 6-8 nationalities in our heritage. We had blonds, redheads, brunettes, and skin ranging from pasty white to olive. </p>
<p>Here everywhere I look I see black hair. Not even brown, just black hair. When classes let out, I see mobs of black heads barreling down the hill and I get this sense of being invaded.</p>
<p>I fear for my country. Actually it&rsquo;s bordering on panic.</p>

		<p>This is what the feds want silicon valley to do. Every other organization in the country has to do it.</p>
<p>chancellor@ucsd.edu</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (VC EDI)</p>
<p>The proposal for the creation of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (VC EDI) follows the &ldquo;portfolio model&rdquo; in which the VC EDI has direct responsibility for a range of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices and the individuals in those areas with responsibility for the initiative.  </p>
<p>The VC EDI will be a direct report to the Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, with an indirect reporting to the Chancellor.  This reporting relationship is advanced as the most financially viable and cost-effective organizational structure.</p>
<p>A key task of the new VC EDI will be to develop an appropriate organizational framework either through collaborations and/or by strengthening existing partnerships with diversity and outreach functions across campus that affect all members of our University community. As initially proposed, student and staff diversity liaisons are indirect reports to the VC EDI, and faculty diversity is a direct report.  The VC EDI will establish an Advisory Council representing campus constituencies.  With the Board&rsquo;s advice, the VC EDI will develop and implement a campus-wide strategic plan on equity, diversity and inclusion. The Strategic Plan will inform the final core administrative responsibilities, propose metrics to gauge progress, and identify potential additional areas of responsibility reporting directly to the office of the VC EDI.  The VC EDI will serve as a member of the Chancellor&rsquo;s executive Cabinet and will be an ex officio member of the Campus Climate Council and the Diversity Council.  </p>
<p>Following discussion with the Executive Vice Chancellor and the Vice Chancellors, the initial core administrative responsibilities in the portfolio of the VC EDI are proposed below. </p>
<p>Core Administrative Responsibilities and Staff of VC EDI</p>
<p>Appointment:               <br>

		<p>Of course diversity data is going to be a secret. It&rsquo;s the Whites are underrepresented and therefore not news worthy. Whites are not significant because they are the &#8220;evil&#8221; ones. The Asians and educatied darker skinned people know that. Normally they have contempt for whites, especially knowing whites are the ones who started all this high-tech. </p>

<p>One thing we do know about MSFT, its effective corporate income tax rate last FY was 7%.  It dodged a lot of conventional American corporate income taxes because it &#8220;shifted&#8221; a lot of its business &#8220;on paper&#8221; to Puerto Rico.  (Funny, PR is &#8220;American&#8221; enough for half the island to be on American food stamps, but I digress).  The hook that MSFT uses for PR is that it has a plant where it produces the physical CDs and DVDs for Microsoft software products.</p>
