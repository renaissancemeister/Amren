			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Samuels, Washington Post, November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The surge in Hispanic students across the nation is forcing schools to reckon with a deep shortage of teachers who share their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>More than 21 percent of schoolchildren are Hispanic, experts report, compared with 7 percent of teachers. No other racial or ethnic minority group has such a wide disparity. In the struggle to close this gap, the stakes are high: Research suggests that a more diverse faculty might lead to better attendance, fewer suspensions and higher test scores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prince George&rsquo;s, like many school systems, faces several challenges in finding Hispanic teachers in tight budget times. Many of its Hispanic residents are immigrants and lack college degrees. County recruiters have tried several strategies: word of mouth, e-mail blasts, going to Puerto Rico, recruiting from colleges with many Hispanic students and offering to cover job prospects&rsquo; relocation costs to sweeten the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we hear of a Hispanic teacher who is qualified, we are going to go after them,&#8221; said Robert Gaskin, the county&rsquo;s recruiting director. &#8220;Everyone is.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The portion of Hispanic students in public schools nationwide doubled from 1989 to 2009, federal data show, and will rise further in coming years. In test scores and graduation rates, Hispanic students trail their non-Hispanic white and Asian peers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For out-of-town hiring, competition is stiff. School systems comb through the private sector, looking for professionals in search of a higher purpose. They battle at job fairs at Hispanic-serving colleges.</p>

		<p>As they outbreed us, and likely push us out (and we do try and avoid their racism when possible), they also claim victim status from being unrepresented, and from earning lower pay. They never point out that younger people of all race earn less, and people of color often have an average age almost half that of the white average. </p>

		<p>The Mexican jackpot is upgrading their lifestyle from a lettuce picker or dishwasher into being a medical translator or court translator&hellip;for all the lettuce pickers and dishwashers that can&rsquo;t speak any English.</p>
<p>Maybe being a teacher will become the new Mexican gold standard for &#8220;doing the jobs that Americans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221;</p>

<p>What this country truly needs is an economic catastrophe so severe it devastates the population to the point where the main concern of even the elites is self-survival fought for on a daily basis, so that every single ounce of politically correct drivel is totally forgotten to the point where only keeping fed and alive are given the highest priorities.</p>
<p>Social engineering is the result of having people, who are comfortable, well fed and safe, free to allow their minds to wander off into matters that are detrimental to themselves as a people, which seems to be a trait of whites worldwide.</p>

		<p>Prediction - teaching jobs will be harder to come by for Anglophone white teachers, as &#8220;hiring bilingual&#8221; will become more of a practice to solve this &#8220;national emergency&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Over the last 50 years the USA has spent untold trillions on defense and security. I imagine that every facet of every country&rsquo;s military, economic,and demographic situation has been intensely studied. Do any Amren readers know of a government (CIA, FBI,NSA, Military intelligence etc) study of what happens to the USA if the if the current immigration policy is maintained?</p>

		<p>So THAT&rsquo;S why hispanics have such low grades and high dropout rates- because their teachers don&rsquo;t &#8220;share their cultural heritage&#8221;.</p>
<p>If they only had Latino teachers they&rsquo;d be geniuses; after all, you can&rsquo;t learn reading, math, history or science unless your instructor is the same race as you.</p>

<p>My first two Calculus teachers/professors were both young life immigrants from Nigeria, in fact, both from the same tribe (Ibo).  We were about as far apart in cultural heritage as can be.  Yet, that somehow didn&rsquo;t preclude me from learning Calculus nor preclude them from teaching it.</p>

		<p>When I was looking for a teaching job, I considered changing my name to a Spanish sounding name since I knew the schools would be fighting over me. I am white but dark and can pass for half Spanish.  </p>
<p>Never changed my name and never got a teaching job.  Instead I started a business.  Their loss, not mine. </p>

		<p>Well, Duh!  Most latinos have arrived in the last 10-15 years.  Hardly enough time to have moved up the ladder of the American dream and taken up middle class professions.  100 years ago there were no teachers of Italian descent, because most of those immigrants were laborers or small businessmen.  After 2-3 generations they started to produce teachers.</p>
<p>Trouble is, every immigrant group wants instant success NOW, without struggling for 2,3 or 4 generations like our own ancestors did.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it works, you need mentors. Unless you are a white student or resident. Because then, you need leaders, teachers and social workers who don&rsquo;t look like you at all as part of the all important quest for diversity. </p>

		<p>My favorite story relevant to this:<br>
A couple of years ago I was in my accountant&rsquo;s office waiting to give him the information for him to file my tax returns. The lady ahead of me was Spanish-speaking and I couldn&rsquo;t help but overhear that she was asking him, in fractured English, if she could claim a tax break on her condo. in Puerto Rico.<br>
Now, I live near a Dominican neighborhood in New York City. Dominicans and Puerto Ricans don&rsquo;t like each other and don&rsquo;t interract with each other.<br>
My question to my accountant, when my turn came around, was why would a Dominican lady buy a condo. in Puerto Rico?<br>
His answer: She was indeed Puerto Rican and had retired from the New York City school system with a six-figure pension after a long career as a bilingual teacher. Lack of facility in the English language had not proved an obstacle in her career.<br>
The moral of the story? Bilingual education has for decades been used to provide well-paid jobs for Hispanics who don&rsquo;t speak English.<br>
We white people have really been mugs.<br>
P.S. My accountant just moved his office to my nearby (white) neighborhood. His principal reason for doing so was he couldn&rsquo;t stand any longer waiting on line in the local post office and seeing Hispanic women engaging in altercations and fistfights. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s pure racism and discrimination against Legal English Speaking Americans. Most jobs in Oregon go to Spanish Speakers, which means illegal aliens or anchor babies. <br>
 and in Washington state, my elderly mother hires women through an agency called Homestead. When my mother started using it about 8 years ago, in Bellevue WA, she was sent American  women who spoke English. Now she gets Latin Americans with little English.  by the way, her Latin worker is moving to Florida where she says she can speak Spanish all the time and not learn English. </p>
<p>I am exhausted because I can&rsquo;t write enough letters to employers or ICE about hiring illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>So if they are assimilating, why the need for bilingual people?  Why increase in crime if they are assimilating?  Why wave their Mexican flags if they&rsquo;re assimilating?  Why do they need someone of their own race if they are assimilating and trying to be Americans?  What does the race of the teacher matter if many of them drop out (like many blacks do) and lead a life of crime and either end up dead or in prison?</p>
