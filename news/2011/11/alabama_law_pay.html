			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hill, Stand With Arizona, November 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The war against Alabama&rsquo;s immigration law has intensified in recent weeks, with a Justice Department lawsuit, visits by DOJ officials, and a showdown over illegal alien children who have been pulled from Alabama schools. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} As illegals have fled the state by the tens of thousands, the jobs they took  &mdash;  particularly in poultry processing, building trades and transportation  &mdash;  are being filled  once again by Alabama citizens. And the unemployment rate in the state has dropped as a result.</p>
<p>Alabama&rsquo;s unemployment rate fell a half percentage point last month  &mdash;  five times more than the national average of 0.1%. And the drop is not seasonal because it is also a far larger drop than in surrounding states.</p>
<p>To further support this trend, in one heavily Hispanic county with one of the highest percentages of illegal alien labor, the drop has been far more dramatic. Alabama House Majority Leader Rep. Micky Hammon, (R-Decatur), said the huge drop in Marshall County showed the power of Alabama&rsquo;s H.B. 56:</p>
<blockquote>Hammond pointed to Marshall County, which he called &#8220;a known hotbed for illegal immigrant labor.&#8221; He said the rate there was 8.1 percent for October, down from 8.8 percent in September and 10 percent in June, when the immigration law was signed.  &#8220;When Marshall County&rsquo;s unemployment rate drops almost a full 2 percent since the law was signed, it&rsquo;s difficult to deny the law is having a positive effect on employment,&#8221; Hammond said in his statement.</blockquote>
<p>Marshall County Rep. Kerry Rich (R) told WAFF-TV how poultry plants in his county have rapidly replaced illegal workers with legal ones to do the jobs that we are endlessly told &#8220;Americans just won&rsquo;t do&#8221;:</p>

		<p>Here is Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the effects of the law are plainly visible. In recently days I have seen at least 5 Mexican stores and 3 restaurants that have recently closed.</p>
<p>A funny incident happened a few days ago. We have a huge Mercedes-Benz plant here and a new Mercedes executive who had just arrived, was stopped by police for a traffic violation. He had no driver&rsquo;s license, no passport, and could speak almost no English. Under the new law, he was arrested and taken to jail. He called a friend who retrieved his passport and wallet from his hotel room and he was released. To be honest, if you or I were in Germany and were stopped by the police and had no passport or license, we would have been arrested too. </p>
<p>So the law is fair and it is not racist!</p>
<p>By the way, the wives of several of the Germans from Mercedes have opened a great little bakery and coffee shop in downtown Tuscaloosa. I had scones and coffee there the other morning and it was great! We need many more like them.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the next article will be called &#8220;2+2=4&#8221;</p>
<p>But seriously, aside form this being common sense it is good news and hopefully it will wake some non-believers up.  </p>
<p>Lord only knows how common sense has escaped them this long, but I did read liberalism was a mental illness. </p>

		<p>For at least the past decade each time the subject of illegal immigration to fill jobs-Americans-won&rsquo;t-do comes up, I have argued that it&rsquo;s abjectly untrue that Americans won&rsquo;t clean floors or pick vegetables, et al.  Alabama has guts for doing what they&rsquo;ve done and here is the PROOF that it&rsquo;s good for everyone.  </p>

		<p>You know, if we could deport all 30 million Illegal Aliens, we might be able to turn ourselves around, economically. I know it would take a big bite out of crime. </p>

		<p>Anyone who has watched the TV show &#8220;Dirty Jobs&#8221; knows the &#8220;jobs that Americans wont do&#8221; mantra is a lie.  However, what has happened is that our welfare policies remove the incentive to work for the low-skilled and low-IQ Americans.  As a result, businesses have taken to hiring the low-skilled and low-IQ illegal alien and paying them sub-subsistence wages.</p>
<p>You want to put Americans back to work?  Shut down the public assistance money fountain.  It&rsquo;s time we tell some of these folks &#8220;work or starve, your choice&#8221;.</p>

<p>The reason that &#8220;Americans didn&rsquo;t want to do&#8221; those chicken plucking jobs in Marshall County, Alabama was because the plant&rsquo;s owner built the plant there, and advertised the jobs locally as quietly and discretely as possible (TV spots in the middle of the night, etc.), but advertised those jobs heavily in &#8220;La Opinion&#8221; in southern California.</p>

		<p>I suspect the local hospitals are doing better as well without having to provide indigent care.  This is a huge problem, and although the state governement is suppose to reimburse the local hospitals, the amounts reimbursed at 70-80% of what is billed and paid 18-24 months later.  I work at a high level at a local hospital and this is destroying us to the point of bankruptcy.</p>

		<p>Are farmhands and seasonal workers included in those statistics? Overall i think this is a very small sample size and the fact that has been decline in unemployment nationally makes it hard to make such conclusions about this. And i&rsquo;m very much opposed to continued immigration legal or illegal.</p>
