<h1><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/11/top10_diversity.html">Top 10 Reasons to Be Thankful for Diversity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Ajinkya, American Progress, November 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} As the country changes and rapidly becomes more diverse, we can also be thankful that the immigrant experience that launched our grand and sometimes painful experiment in freedom and democracy over the past several centuries lives on today.</p>
<p>{snip} Here are 10 reasons why Americans can be thankful for our rich diversity.</p>
<p>10. We&rsquo;ll actually still have a growing workforce in 2050. Unlike the shrinking labor forces of Japan and much of East and Southeast Asia and Western Europe, the labor force in the United States will continue to grow, largely due to immigration and the children of immigrants. Between 2000 and 2050 new immigrants and their children will account for 83 percent of the growth in the working-age population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>9. Diversity puts the Turkey in Turkey Day. The United States owes its food culture to the amalgamation of different communities&rsquo; tastes and traditions. {snip}</p>
<p>8. We can roll green, thanks to public transit. Even if economics was the driver, communities of color embraced green transportation way before hipsters made it cool. African Americans are almost six times more likely to ride mass transit than whites, while Hispanics are three times more likely to use transit to get around. In urban areas, African Americans and Latinos comprise over 54 percent of transit users  &mdash;  62 percent of bus riders, 35 percent of subway riders, and 29 percent of commuter rail riders.</p>
<p>7. Try to play a piano without the black keys. Black musical creativity fueled much of the modern music industry in the United States. {snip}</p>
<p>6. Diversity encourages students to &#8220;experiment&#8221; in college. In his controlling opinion in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, Justice Lewis F. Powell noted that a diverse student body promotes an atmosphere of &#8220;speculation, experiment and creation&#8221; that is &#8220;essential to the quality of higher education.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>5. Diversity results in better solutions to problems. When confronting a problem, people&rsquo;s perspectives are accompanied by ways of searching for solutions  &mdash;  something scientists call heuristics. {snip}</p>
<p>4. United we stand. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court in 2003 upheld the University of Michigan Law School&rsquo;s affirmative action admissions policy after hearing from a group of former high-ranking officers and civilian leaders of the U.S. military. The military leaders asserted that &#8220;[b]ased on [their] decades of experience&hellip; [a] highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps &hellip; is essential to the military&rsquo;s ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national security.&#8221; They also submitted an amicus brief arguing that &#8220;full integration and other policies combating discrimination are essential to good order, combat readiness, and military effectiveness.&#8221; In other words, diversity equals &#8220;United we stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. Still trying to sell that home? As the ratio of seniors to working-age residents rapidly increases, the boomers who try to sell their homes after retirement are going to increasingly rely on the growing youth population to come to their rescue. {snip}</p>
<p>2. Play ball! Looking forward to the big match up between brothers Jim and John Harbaugh when their teams the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens meet on Thanksgiving? In 2010, we were thankful for 70 percent players of color in the National Football League. And at the beginning of the 2011 season, the National Basketball Association reported 83 percent players of color, Major League Soccer reported 48 percent players of color, and Major League Baseball reported 38 percent players of color.</p>
<p>1. The promise of First Amendment protections for all. The United States was founded on ideals of diversity, from the principle of religious freedom to the marketplace-of-ideas metaphor that are enshrined in our Constitution&rsquo;s First Amendment. {snip}</p>

		<p>A growing work force! For the next 40 years! At a time when unemployment is probably, realistically, close to 20% and will probably never come down to per-recession levels again due to increased productivity and off-shoring. </p>
<p>You know, every American should see this, and not for the reasons the authors think.</p>

		<p><i>10. We&rsquo;ll actually still have a growing workforce in 2050.</i></p>
<p>And sinking wages and salaries.  The average &#8220;American&#8221; of 2050 probably won&rsquo;t be able to afford a whole turkey.  Good times.</p>
<p><i>9. Diversity puts the Turkey in Turkey Day. The United States owes its food culture to the amalgamation of different communities&rsquo; tastes and traditions.</i></p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t have turkey on the fourth Thursday of November unless I live next to Congolese and Laotians?  Americans have been eating turkey for a long time, wonder how we got away with it without diversity.</p>
<p><i>8. We can roll green, thanks to public transit.</i></p>
<p>Actually, we can&rsquo;t.  Black misbehavior on public buses makes it unusable for most whites.</p>
<p><i>7. Try to play a piano without the black keys. Black musical creativity fueled much of the modern music industry in the United States. </i></p>
<p>What the?  I once heard that painting the sharp/flat keys &#8220;black&#8221; was an example of &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>6. Diversity encourages students to &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; in college.</i></p>
<p>Yes, with all sorts of drugs and all sorts of sexual behaviors.</p>
<p><i>5. Diversity results in better solutions to problems. When confronting a problem, people&rsquo;s perspectives are accompanied by ways of searching for solutions &mdash; something scientists call heuristics.</i></p>
<p>What does that have to do with racial diversity?</p>
<p><i>The military leaders asserted that &ldquo;[b]ased on [their] decades of experience&hellip; [a] highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps &hellip; is essential to the military&rsquo;s ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national security.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Au contraire, we haven&rsquo;t done anything close to winning a decisive victory in a major war since the forced integration of the military.  There was an entire black division in Korea that was called the &#8220;Bug Out&#8221; in honor of its cowardice.</p>
<p><i>Still trying to sell that home? As the ratio of seniors to working-age residents rapidly increases, the boomers who try to sell their homes after retirement are going to increasingly rely on the growing youth population to come to their rescue.</i></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that true in every generation?  And what does that have to do with racial diversity?  In contrast, today&rsquo;s older whites can&rsquo;t expect young Hispanic strawberry pickers to be able to buy their houses for anything close to a decent price, because the subprime circus is over.</p>
<p><i>In 2010, we were thankful for 70 percent players of color in the National Football League. And at the beginning of the 2011 season, the National Basketball Association reported 83 percent players of color,</i></p>
<p>Note the NBA and those 83% &#8220;players of color&#8221; are still locked out, because the kind of person who isn&rsquo;t even qualified to flip burgers but for basketball, who made an average of 4-5 million a season until now, can&rsquo;t accept the economic reality that that model is unsustainable.  As James Edwards notes, the typical NBA owner made his money in (seemingly) legitimate pursuits other than sports, and his NBA ownership is a hobby, an increasingly money pit hobby.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re supposed to be thankful for non-whites playing all these professional sports, does this mean that the whites playing in those leagues are a bunch of parasitical ungrateful bastards?</p>
<p><i>The promise of First Amendment protections for all.</i></p>
<p>The authors of that Amendment and that promise weren&rsquo;t very diverse.  Show me the First Amendment and the respect for the &#8220;promise&#8221; of freedom of speech and expression and opinion anywhere in the non-white world.  It&rsquo;s getting more and more rare in the white world, much less.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Does Julia Ajinkya think we&rsquo;re that stupid?  Maybe she thinks her readers are that stupid because they might actually be that stupid.</p>

		<p>I would love to comment in detail on every point raised by the author, but to do so would demand language that violates Amren standards. So I will just deal with the value of diversity in education, as I have experience with that. Beginning in middle school, racial diversity brought up the following question: Does that Mexican with the bandanna just hate those wearing different color bandannas, or does his hate extend to those wearing different color skin.</p>

		<p>Sheer idiocy on every point, however the telltale example was the NBA.  It seems that &#8220;diversity&#8221; simply means &#8220;non-white&#8221; - even where there is virtually no racial diversity.</p>

<p>Intellectual diversity. Yes! But it doesn&rsquo;t mean a White person with an average IQ of 100 can in any way benefit from any ideas coming from a Black person with an average IQ of 85.</p>

<p>Diversity might result in better solutions to problems if diversity did not also mean whites should shut up about their perspectives, their problems, and in fact, according to every institution that celebrates diveristy, all problems are cause by the white part of diversity in the first place. All problem being defined as any problem faced by a person of color.</p>

		<p>This HAD to be written by some indoctrinated leftist who has never had the privilege of seeing REAL diversity up close and personal. </p>
<p>To open your eyes Mzzz Adjinkya, I would suggest a trip to any inner city paradise tonight after dark. You can mingle with the brothas and brotherettes and tell them how much you appreciate the rich diversity they are providing for our nation. After a few hours  of being educated in the hood, you can come back and tell us of your rewarding experience. I would love to hear what you have to say about diversity, after experiencing it first hand for yourself, rather than relying on what your idiot professors crammed into your impressionable head.</p>
<p>And just curious here. Do you really think that a sports league that is 83% black, qualifies as a diverse league? </p>

		<p>The celebrated black contributions to music are two: Jazz improvisation and &lsquo;Scat&rsquo;. Jazz improvisation is a consequence of blacks not learning their solos. Scat is a consequence of blacks not learning their words.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine life without either. Rap, while not as celebrated, probably peaked with 2LiveCrew (graphic language).</p>

		<p>If they have to use lame examples such as sports, music, food, mass transportation, and some nonsensical 1st Amendment excuse just to fill out a Top Ten List of how diversity is a strength, then they&rsquo;ve lost the debate.  I&rsquo;m sure anyone here on AmRen could come up with a legitimate Top TWENTY List as to why it is not.  Things such as astronomically higher crime rates, resurgence of diseases once eradicated from the US, constant race-based friction, dumbed down educational system to accommodate the slower learning minorities, higher taxation to cover the social service costs of minorities, and lower standard of living for whites, to name a few.  Please tell me progressives have the legitimate list tucked away somewhere, ready to spring its wondrous virtues on us at a later date.  Surely they don&rsquo;t advocate for diversity based upon this list.</p>

<p>===============================<br>
A quick look at the author:<br>
Julie Ajinkya is a Policy Analyst for Progress 2050 at American Progress. Her work focuses on race-ethnic, gender, and immigration politics, and she pays particular attention to the changing demographics of multicultural societies such as the United States and Western Europe.</p>
<p>Prior to joining American Progress, she was a research fellow and policy analyst at Gender Action&hellip;Julie earned her M.A. and Ph.D. in government from Cornell University, where her doctoral dissertation examined the political behavior of children of Muslim immigrants and their campaigns for gender-justice activism in Europe and North America. </p>
<p>==================================================</p>
<p>If I were her I&rsquo;d be thankful I had a job. People like her are worse than dangerous and I suspect she cannot wait for the last white/European people to either die or be run off the continent.</p>
<p>Sadly, the future she envisions will actually be a failing, second-world country clinging to prevent a slide into third-world obscurity. She&rsquo;ll then wonder what went wrong and one night wake up in a sweat realizing that whites built what she helped destroy. And guess what - the whites aren&rsquo;t coming back. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll have moved to a safe haven free of her ilk.</p>
<p>As for her list - can she not see the difference between fact and opinion? Her discourse is both ideological coupled with wishful thinking with no real view of the true implications.</p>
<p>Her points show no benefit whatsoever to a growing, prosperous society.</p>
<p>10 - A growing workforce is nice but low IQ bodies do not make for a growing workforce. It makes for more people looking for  government handouts or menial jobs.</p>
<p>9 - What does food have to do with anything? Besides, does she think that a white European is not able to cook an Asian dish? Let&rsquo;s say America was 100% white - I tend to think we have the brains to prepare cuisines from around the world.</p>
<p>8- &#8220;African Americans are almost six times more likely to ride mass transit than whites, while Hispanics are three times more likely to use transit to get around.&#8221; First, green has nothing to do with it. When was the last time you saw a black worried about the environment? They take mass transit because they either can&rsquo;t afford cars/insurance or are in between hoopties.</p>
<p>7 - &#8220;Black musical creativity fueled much of the modern music industry in the United States.&#8221;  Really? Who says? What nonsense. Then she adds &#8220;yet the shortage of African American executives belies a significant disconnect between the industry&rsquo;s management hierarchy and its artistic composition and influence.&#8221; No - whatever black music filtered into the culture was 100% orchestrated (pun intended) by white brains. Don&rsquo;t give yourself too much credit, sister. Sales of hip-hop music do not reflect anything but kids with some extra spending money.</p>
<p>6 - &#8220;Empirical studies also show that socializing across racial and ethnic lines is associated with widespread beneficial effects on a student&rsquo;s academic as well as personal development, irrespective of race.&#8221; Hardly. This is a lie - she cherry-picked &#8220;research&#8221; while ignoring the fact that studies showing the opposite are suppressed. Besides, if a court orders people to mix to placate an interest group then you don&rsquo;t need to be a rocket scientist to realize it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>5- Diversity results in problems, not solutions. Tell me how analyzing a spreadsheet or engineering a bridge or performing surgery benefits from an affirmative action minority piping in only because he or she is black?</p>
<p>4- National security? What planet does she live on? Enough said.</p>
<p>3- Voodoo economics at its best. I hope those &#8220;people of color&#8221; don&rsquo;t come to my &#8220;rescue.&#8221;</p>
<p>2- &#8220;In 2010, we were thankful for 70 percent players of color in the National Football League.&#8221; We were? I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what the Pilgrims had in mind back in 1621 - that one day all of this toil will mean we can celebrate the fact that africans make up 70 percent of people who carry a funny-shaped ball around a field to entertain white people. This is a racist statement. Who cares what color the players are?</p>
<p>Can you imagine someone writing &#8220;I&rsquo;m thankful that 98% of the players in the NHL are white&#8221; or &#8220;I give thanks that 99% of NASCAR drivers are white&#8221; or &#8220;I am very thankful that 95% of American physicians are not black.&#8221; </p>
<p>1 - &#8220;The United States was founded on ideals of diversity.&#8221; Not quite. Diversity in the founding of the US meant shades of slight variations among people of European descent. The founders never envisioned diversity to mean that the Irish or Italian or Polish, etc&hellip;were meant to live with Africans or others from the far reaches of the globe.   </p>

		<p>Magnificent! As others have noted, this just proves beyond all doubt that even those who shamelessly promote this &#8220;Diversity&#8221; nonsense cannot articulate a single, reasoned, tangible explanation of how or why it is a benefit&hellip;to Whites anyway! </p>
<p>Not only that, but these supposed &#8220;reasons&#8221; are so silly, so utterly devoid of substance or even a solid grasp of reality, that it exposes the whole &#8220;diversity&#8221; sham almost better than any of us even could!!    </p>

<p>Beyond laughable.</p>
<p>The &#8220;immigrant&#8221; experience did not launch our &#8220;experiment in democracy and freedom.&#8221;  The Constitution of the United States did.</p>

<p>The only reason I am thankful for the current forced diversity is that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until those who think it&rsquo;s the solution have experienced how differently what they have been told by the government actually works in real-life settings.</p>

		<p>You know, it would be great to have an article about the top 10 reasons to be unthankful about diversity. But then you would be writing about that issue using logic and reality. Unlike the fluff in the above article. Plus, how could you possibly limit such an article against diversity to just 10 reasons? More like the top 100 reasons. </p>
<p>And let me make a statement on the first silly reason given in the above article about diversity. The founders would never have supported diversity and multiculturalism. They founded the country for whites by whites. So I find it extremely odd that the constitution is brought into this argument. Especially since diversity has caused &#8220;hate crime&#8221; laws to be passed. And these laws silence the freedom of speech of whites. Yet, I as a white person am to be thankful about this? Yeah, maybe in the land of OZ. Infact, that must have been where that article was written. </p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, I derided the once-powerful Philadelphia Inquirer, the (now) anti-white racist city rag that has degenerated into extolling the wonders of diversity and black empowerment while belittling the significant accomplishments of local whites/suburbanites. Isolated from hard-core realities in their gleaming white Taj Mahal on Broad Street, these elitist hacks pushed their multicultural agenda to the very breaking point.</p>
<p>And guess what, folks? It just broke. Seems that in the course of delivering all their &#8220;crush the caucasian&#8221; agitprop, they forgot the bottom line: BLACKS DON&rsquo;T READ! Having vilified and consequently driven off their legions of white readers, The Inquirer now finds itself a dying business that can&rsquo;t - and won&rsquo;t ever again - make the nut. They&rsquo;ve put the Taj Mahal on the auction block and they will shortly be moving into a floor in the old Lit Brothers Department Store Building on Market Street - and a few years after this, I suspect, into the back room of a hair-weaving establishment in West Philly.</p>

African Americans are almost six times more likely to ride mass transit than whites, while Hispanics are three times more likely to use transit to get around. In urban areas, African Americans and Latinos comprise over 54 percent of transit users &mdash; 62 percent of bus riders, 35 percent of subway riders, and 29 percent of commuter rail riders.</p>

When I read the headline, I thought someone was taking up the challenge to prove that diversity is a strength. What I read was an inane list of obscure alleged benefits.</p>
<p>Blacks are responsible for green public transit? That&rsquo;s news to the people of London, Paris, Boston, and New York who developed subway systems when their cities were majority white.</p>
<p>A growing workforce at a time when automation decreases the number of workers needed and while we&rsquo;re suffering high rates of unemployment? We have record numbers of illegals in the US today. If a large work force is a strength, why are we in an economic downturn? Large numbers of people are not the source of economic growth. </p>
<p>Blacks contribution to American music? This statement drives me mad because it implies that without blacks, there would be no music. White people had music, both classical and popular, before blacks.</p>
<p>The turkey in turkey day? Did blacks discover the turkey and how to prepare it in all it&rsquo;s different ways?  </p>
<p>Blacks encourage &#8216;experimentation&rsquo; in college? What kind of &#8216;experimentation&rsquo; are we talking about? Did blacks bring higher standards and higher achievement?</p>
<p>Diversity leads to better problem solving? The opposite is true. The greater the diversity, the greater the number of intractable and unsolvable problems grow.</p>
<p>Selling a home? White people can&rsquo;t sell their home if there weren&rsquo;t non-whites buying them?</p>
<p>Diversity in sports? The NBA is 83% people of color. How is that diversity if it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the racial make up of the population?</p>

<p>So right, it&rsquo;s an outrage.  People now feel free to come here by whatever means and then set about to lecture us on how we must accept them and there ways, and how our culture and ways are evil.</p>
<p>I saw Fareed Zakaria doing the same thing on CNN on Sunday, using the Breivik rampage in Norway as his springboard to rationalizing why whites in Europe are the real terrorists and how Europe must redouble its efforts to integrate Muslims and other non-whites into Europe.  He failed to explain what the benefits to white Europe or whites anywhere might be.  Any sort of national feeling is now the definition of evil to his ilk.  He would have it understood, and apparently enforced by law, even international law, that whites exhibiting any desire to preserve themselves or their indigenous nations is a high crime.  </p>

<p>Nevertheless, blacks are only roughly 12% of the population! If anything resembling such disparities, with respectively 70-84% white anything were involved, the cries of racism and discrimination would be endless. There would be immediate demands to implement diversity training, as well as federal funds allocated to study why such a racial disparity could ever be allowed to exists.</p>
<p>Face it, &#8220;diversity and multiculturalism&#8221; are code words for white dispossession!<br>

		<p><b>10. We&rsquo;ll actually still have a growing workforce in 2050. Unlike the shrinking labor forces of Japan and much of East and Southeast Asia and Western Europe, the labor force in the United States will continue to grow, largely due to immigration and the children of immigrants. Between 2000 and 2050 new immigrants and their children will account for 83 percent of the growth in the working-age population.</b></p>
<p>Yes, with illegal immigration, more whites being pushed out of the workforce for a more &#8216;diverse workforce&rsquo;, more jobs going overseas, more white businesses confiscated and handed over to nonwhites to further drive the country more into third-world status.  Sounds like a real positive economic growth when you look at all that!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>9. Diversity puts the Turkey in Turkey Day. The United States owes its food culture to the amalgamation of different communities&rsquo; tastes and traditions. {snip}</b></p>
<p>Yes, minus the crime, corruption, leeching off the public dole, loss of jobs for Westerners, less freedoms for whites, turkey is the first thing that comes to my mind!</p>
<p><b>8. We can roll green, thanks to public transit. Even if economics was the driver, communities of color embraced green transportation way before hipsters made it cool. African Americans are almost six times more likely to ride mass transit than whites, while Hispanics are three times more likely to use transit to get around. In urban areas, African Americans and Latinos comprise over 54 percent of transit users &mdash; 62 percent of bus riders, 35 percent of subway riders, and 29 percent of commuter rail riders.</b></p>
<p>Yes, think of how boring and pitiful our public transportation be without blacks to harass others and commit crimes against others on there!</p>
<p><b>7. Try to play a piano without the black keys. Black musical creativity fueled much of the modern music industry in the United States. {snip}</b></p>
<p>Yes, and never mind it was Irish and Germans that created those pianos that blacks played on.  Yes, without black music, we really never would have had a constitution, won both world wars, invented tv, invented cars, clean drinking water, modern technology, etc.</p>
<p><b>6. Diversity encourages students to &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; in college. In his controlling opinion in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, Justice Lewis F. Powell noted that a diverse student body promotes an atmosphere of &ldquo;speculation, experiment and creation&rdquo; that is &ldquo;essential to the quality of higher education.&rdquo; {snip}</b></p>
<p>Yes, we see how great it was that we added more blacks and hispanics to our country has been when you look at the crime, gangs, out-of-wedlock births, race riots, loss of jobs, loss of freedom of association rights for whites, higher taxes, declining US cities that became majority nonwhite.  </p>
<p><b>5. Diversity results in better solutions to problems. When confronting a problem, people&rsquo;s perspectives are accompanied by ways of searching for solutions &mdash; something scientists call heuristics. {snip}</b></p>
<p>Yes, because racially homogenous societies are really missing out on all the race riots, culture clashing, etc.</p>
<p><b>4. United we stand. In Grutter v. Bollinger, the Supreme Court in 2003 upheld the University of Michigan Law School&rsquo;s affirmative action admissions policy after hearing from a group of former high-ranking officers and civilian leaders of the U.S. military. The military leaders asserted that &ldquo;[b]ased on [their] decades of experience&hellip; [a] highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps &hellip; is essential to the military&rsquo;s ability to fulfill its principle mission to provide national security.&rdquo; They also submitted an amicus brief arguing that &ldquo;full integration and other policies combating discrimination are essential to good order, combat readiness, and military effectiveness.&rdquo; In other words, diversity equals &ldquo;United we stand.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Yes, how bigoted it is to suggest that someone get into college on their own merits instead of their race!</p>
<p><b>3. Still trying to sell that home? As the ratio of seniors to working-age residents rapidly increases, the boomers who try to sell their homes after retirement are going to increasingly rely on the growing youth population to come to their rescue. {snip}</b></p>
<p>Um, really hard to sell a home that was once in a white neighborhood turned nonwhite when more blacks and browns has a sharp increase in crime.  I&rsquo;m so sure the black and hispanics will turn those boring white neighborhoods into vibrant neighborhoods with their social pathologies, crimes, low IQs, macho loser (unemployed) men, etc.</p>
<p><b>2. Play ball! Looking forward to the big match up between brothers Jim and John Harbaugh when their teams the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens meet on Thanksgiving? In 2010, we were thankful for 70 percent players of color in the National Football League. And at the beginning of the 2011 season, the National Basketball Association reported 83 percent players of color, Major League Soccer reported 48 percent players of color, and Major League Baseball reported 38 percent players of color.</b></p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s diverse when we have nothing but blacks playing sports, but &#8216;racist and lacking diversity&rsquo; when white men dominate an industry, yes?  I really enjoy watching a bunch of black male thugs throwing a ball around at each other and denigrating a sport that was created by white men.</p>
<p><b>1. The promise of First Amendment protections for all. The United States was founded on ideals of diversity, from the principle of religious freedom to the marketplace-of-ideas metaphor that are enshrined in our Constitution&rsquo;s First Amendment. {snip}</b></p>
<p>Right, like how liberals and nonwhites are trying to silence us whites through hate speech laws and telling us we can&rsquo;t say &#8216;god&rsquo; or Merry Christmas anymore?  Like having a white celebrity get fired and blacklisted or make them apologize until the end of time when they say something that offends liberals and nonwhites? Is that what you mean?  But, wait a minute&hellip;  Aren&rsquo;t you nonwhites and liberals complaining that the Constitution shouldn&rsquo;t matter since it was created by white men?  I mean, why do you embrace a document and live by its creed if it was created by people you hate?  That&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t it my fellow black and hispanic friends. Hmmmmmm&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>10: &#8220;Unlike the shrinking labor forces of Japan and much of East and Southeast Asia and Western Europe, the labor force in the United States will continue to grow, largely due to immigration and the children of immigrants. Between 2000 and 2050 new immigrants and their children will account for 83 percent of the growth in the working-age population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labour force consisting of unskilled and badly educated people is at best a mixed blessing. A potential labour force, a lot of which has no interest in pursuing any honest career whatsoever, is even worse. Just looking at age is simplistic to the point of idiocy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A recent report demonstrates that immigrants are following the path of their predecessors and assimilating just as rapidly today as they did in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apart from the point that the most controversial and problematic minority in USA is not an immigrant one at all, this statement commits the deadly sin of lumping all immigrants into one. Sure, European and East Asian immigrants are assimilating very well, and they&rsquo;re probably amongst the most ambitious and smart folk of their kind. A lot of Hispanic immigrants are no doubt doing what Irish did - lots of problems at first, but productive assimilation eventually.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of immigrants who just aren&rsquo;t up to no good, and blacks certainly aren&rsquo;t assimilating or starting businesses at superior rates. Personally I don&rsquo;t care if a productive citizen is a newcomer or not (some of you will disagree). If he&rsquo;s a drain on resources or an active troublemaker, then good riddance, though.</p>
<p>9. &#8220;If it weren&rsquo;t for the constant food innovation from diverse communities that developed our national tastes, we&rsquo;d still be eating boiled cabbage, with ketchup as our favorite condiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yeah. The culinary traditions of all fairly monocultural people around the world are on the level of boiled cabbage. It&rsquo;s not true, and spreading food innovation takes very little contact - either a fair bit of one civilization traveling to some other, or that other one emigrating to set up a few restaurants (which incidentally is one of the best start-up jobs for immigrants).</p>
<p>I like kebab. I like Chinese food. I could have both of those without multiculturalism that I detest.</p>
<p>8. &#8220;Even if economics was the driver, communities of color embraced green transportation way before hipsters made it cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>They embraced it because they probably won&rsquo;t get robbed and beaten by racist criminals. The Euro city I live in has superb public transportation, good enough that I&rsquo;ve never really thought about buying a car. If we get much more diversity though, then who knows.</p>
<p>7. &#8220;Black musical creativity fueled much of the modern music industry in the United States. African Americans have created and driven various musical genres.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the one area where blacks have made genuine contributions. Some of their blues and jazz can hardly be praised enough. A real pity that their entire musical tradition sank into the cultural and moral black hole of rap.</p>
<p>6. &amp; 5. &#8220;When confronting a problem, people&rsquo;s perspectives are accompanied by ways of searching for solutions &mdash; something scientists call heuristics. In plain English, this means people have diverse approaches to solutions. Studies show that the diversity of approaches on any given team outperforms the overall ability or talent of the team&rsquo;s members.&#8221;</p>
<p>True. Then again, it&rsquo;s the differences in professional careers and education that increase diverse approaches to solutions. Age differences also have some effect on this. The differences in ethnic backgrounds (controlled for the previously mentioned factors) increase only emotional conflict. The diversity that is fetishized is precisely the wrong kind of diversity. </p>
<p>2. - 4.: Won&rsquo;t dignify those with counterarguments. I think Ajinkya thought up seven arguments he considered good enough, and made up those three to get a nice round number.</p>
<p>1. &#8220;1. The promise of First Amendment protections for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I kind of admire the sheer chutspah of a diversity advocate invoking 1st Amendment, when it has been them who&rsquo;ve done all they could to rape it to death with &#8220;hate speech&#8221; taboos and PC speech codes.</p>

<p>John Podesta, in 2003, started this organization.  It seems, time and again, that our own people do this to us.  He is a white Roman Catholic.  How could his brain lead him to design this organization to assist in destroying his own people.  The Hispanics and blacks aren&rsquo;t doing this to us, our own errant elite is.  These minorities are weak minded opportunists who will accept &#8220;free&#8221; when it is thrown at them.  Bears in parks do the same. We are a powerful nation.  No other can defeat us.  But we can defeat ourselves from within.  People and organizations like Podesta and the SPLC and the ADL and others are currently destroying us from for reasons that defy explanation.  If we can&rsquo;t somehow defeat them, then all is lost in a relatively short time.  Half of babies are now brown.  They will always be hugely on welfare until there is no welfare.  They, in a very real and absolute sense, cannot duplicate the sophisticated work product of those who they are replacing. When Mexico&rsquo;s descendants become the majority they will elect their own kind as surely as the sun rises, and with the same surety they will form a new Mexico, which will resemble the old Mexico, hellhole that it is.  <br>
Those of you from the SPLC monitoring this site, think of this, quietly at first, and then have the courage of your new convictions, and act accordingly. Time is running late.</p>

<p>Great rebuttals overall, but the modern piano is obviously an Italian instrument created by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731): <a href="https://goo.gl/hgS8o" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/hgS8o</a></p>
<p>The point here is that American music comes directly from Europe and White Americans.  There would be no Jazz without Classical music, no Blues without Folk Music, no Gospel without Choral music, no Zydeco without Cajun music, and certainly no Rock without Country Music and the later invention of the electric guitar.  All the blacks did was to use the White man&rsquo;s instruments and simplify everything that already existed for centuries in the first place.  This is like this PC nonsense that Jimmy Hendrix is the greatest guitar player of all time when Stevie Ray Vaughan easily emulated him within a decade, but no one can still match the speed and technique of living flamenco players like Paco de Lucía from Spain.</p>
<p>The only genre blacks can take full credit for is rap, which of course, doesn&rsquo;t require any instrument nor a proper command of the English language..Figures !</p>

<p>really, she should speak of things she knows something about.  Ten years ago in Indianapolis I saw the remnants of the former &#8220;green transporation&#8221; in the form of tramtracks, that had not been removed yet. &#8220;Green transportation&#8221; has been in use since the  stage coach, horse drawn streeet cars, graduating to electric streetcars. In Europe it was never done away with, but enlarged and improved continually. In the US they had nothing better to do than to tear up the tracks and have everybody drive their own car. And now, thanks to black ingenuity and concern for the environment, they are bringing back some measly buses or something?(spare me, I know NYC has a metro)</p>

Never seen so much diversity in my life, it is often that I am the only white male on the bus. The idiot who wrote this does not seem to realize that taking public transportation outside the downtown core is a question of money, most who take the bus cannot afford a car.</p>

		<p>Uniformity produces harmony, diversity leads to strife. Homogenous societies lead to social peace &amp; prosperity, division produces crime, resentment &amp; eventually civil war.

<p>It also reminds us of how the UN has often been a weapon against the West, a platform and shield for the continuity of corruption in Africa, an anti-Jewish/pro-Hamas organization, and a haven for foreigners who wish to bring any sort of contraband into the US through the &#8220;diplomatic envelope&#8221; and be immune to US and international law enforcement. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching the 1980 film, &#8220;The Elephant Man.&#8221;  I watched it today because I suspect this film contains the answer as to why whites are giving up their countries and not fighting back.  Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8216;$64 question&rsquo;.  The theme of the movie is the Elephant Man character is a victim.  Any compassionate, normal viewer would connect with this.  I believe white people see non-whites, blacks in particular, as victims.  This is the root of the whole problem.  It is a misclassification in the minds of white people.  Whites are very compassionate people.  They want to help others.  The look at the faces of blacks, they see the different shape of the nose and face, and subconsciously think this is an unfortunate, deformed person.  They&rsquo;ve been brainwashed by the media with thousands of images and associate blacks with victimhood.  I urge you to get a copy of &#8216;The Elephant Man&rsquo;.  Watch the movie keeping in mind my hypothesis.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;We can roll green, thanks to public transit. Even if economics was the driver, communities of color embraced green transportation way before hipsters made it cool. African Americans are almost six times more likely to ride mass transit than whites, while Hispanics are three times more likely to use transit to get around. In urban areas, African Americans and Latinos comprise over 54 percent of transit users &mdash; 62 percent of bus riders, 35 percent of subway riders, and 29 percent of commuter rail riders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s just wonderful that people of color are too poor to afford a car. [&#8220;embraced green transportation&#8221;?  Lol].  It&rsquo;s too bad that all the people of color on the bus make it a lot less safe for poor Whites and Asians to ride it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity results in better solutions to problems. When confronting a problem, people&rsquo;s perspectives are accompanied by ways of searching for solutions &mdash; something scientists call heuristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is functional diversity not racial diversity.  It&rsquo;s shocking how people continue to confuse the two.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s ironic in an article about racial diversity.  In the general sense of the term, &#8220;heuristics&#8221; is the popular application of experience and common sense (and sometimes raw data) to come to a conclusion to a question which has no exact answer.  Our (and by mean &#8220;our,&#8221; I mean the typical AR reader) fear of certain &#8220;diverse&#8221; races is the result of heuristics.  Other examples of the heuristic approach are computer virus and malware scanners (you can never know for sure whether a file is a virus, the scanner calculates odds), audits by financial accountants (they often use probability and statistics to calculate the odds of whether there is financial accounting malfeasance or perfidy or incompetence, because unless you have a direct pipeline to God who has a direct pipeline to the brains of the accountants and other employees running the company you&rsquo;re auditing, you don&rsquo;t know for sure).</p>

<p>Good point. Good luck changing the media and education system so as we can all be informed african american&rsquo;s are just like everyone else and are not always (strangely enough) victims. I would say, too, not recognizing or keeping at the forefront of the mind the idea african americans are all victims is the ultimate expression of &#8216;racism&rsquo; and insensitivity in america.</p>
<p>This idolizing of victims will only end when whites become official victims? </p>

		<p>I am not the &#8220;76 - Jason&#8221; who makes a strong point.  It helps explain why the &#8220;beautiful people&#8221; among intelligent liberals especially feel guilt and compassion, though their conscious minds repress the reasons, while less fortunate whites do not feel quite the same about alien competitors; and it also explains some features of anti-racist counter-propaganda (e.g. European-looking movie heroes). <br>
This is certainly an area of social psychology worth investigating.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, the growing workforce argument.  Just what we need in a country with near depression levels of unemployment.  Bright idea, that.  Don&rsquo;t forget that the bulk of the &#8220;growing work force&#8221; consists of Mestizos, with an average IQ of 92.  That will do wonders for the tech industry.  Another substantial amount of immigration comes from Africa, with an average IQ of 85 (or less).  I grant that the immigrants from India and China tend to be educated and reasonably smart, but their main effect is to put more American programmers and engineers out of work.</p>
<p>The other arguments are even sillier.<br>

<p>Mr. Taylor has written about this. To paraphrase, &#8216;whites, far from being evil bad guys they are said to be, are in fact too nice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the past, when whites were on their own, this was a strenght. Now, our own compassion is being used to undermine us.</p>
<p>While I no longer fall hook, line, and sinker for every non-white tale of hard luck and oppression, I still see myself as a compassionate person. I don&rsquo;t like seeing anyone in pain or poverty. The difference is that now I see that too many people are the cause of their own pain and poverty.<br>

		<p>Related news that is only tangentially on topic to this story:  The NBA labor strife seems to be over.  Coincidentally, it ended not even a month after what would have been the start of the regular season.  IIRC, NBA salaries are prorated biweekly over the course of the regular season.  This means by now, NBA players already missed out on one and maybe two regular season paychecks.  That&rsquo;s the point when they broke down.  Just as James Edwards predicted.  Child support needed to be paid, weed feeders needed to be paid, their notes on their hooptees with chrome spinners needed to be paid, etc.  Mark me, we will eventually find out that the owners won most of the battles, and the players mostly caved.</p>

		<p>3 - Question Diversity</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re correct about the infamous all-black 24th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division in Korea.  It became known as the Bug-Out Deuce-Four for its propensity to break and run from any contact with North Korean or Chinese forces and actually provided the impetus for the integration of the Army.  The 24th was broken up and dispersed among the other regiments of the 25th Division, a forced integration that was quickly accomplished throughout the Army in the months that followed.  Interestingly, black troops in today&rsquo;s Army are once again mostly dispersed throughout support functions, since members of today&rsquo;s Army can select their preferred MOS, and blacks overwhelmingly avoid the combat arms.  My first tour in Vietnam was with a rifle company (the second with the 5th SF Grp), and most of our disciplinary  problems originated with the black troops.  To be sure, many and probably most of them performed well and courageously, but again, when there were problems it was usually with the blacks, though they represented only 10-12% of typical line company strength. This little factoid is contrary to the popular belief that rifle companies were manned overwhelmingly by poor blacks and Hispanics.  The Hispanics, by the way, were usually tough and effective troopers. </p>

		<p>Does this woman think that Turkeys were brought here by the TURKS?</p>
<p>And does she not realize that our people (you know, White People&hellip;) have been importing exotic ingredients and recipes for thousands of years?  Does she not know that traditional Americans have, for centuries, had large cookbooks?  Does she not know about our cooking schools, culinary academies&hellip;.or Julia Child?  Whites disseminate and create knowledge about food.  We develop ingredients (including the large and tender Domesticated Turkey), and we invented most of the means of modern cooking.  Lily white places like New England were not wanting for delicious fare, in the days when many New Englanders had never seen a brown face.  They had stores. They had cookbooks.  They had access to systems of distribution.  They did not need brown people to teach them about exciting &#8216;foodways&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Public transportation?  The presence of blacks and hispanics is the reason why whites refuse to ride.  If THEY weren&rsquo;t around, then WE would use the buses and the trains.  </p>
<p>And the whole notion that &#8216;we&rsquo; should be thankful for anything concerning sports amazes me.  I&rsquo;d estimate that an easy half of Americans absolutely HATE sports.  The notion that we would be thankful for non-white players occupies its own realm of absurdity.  Does this woman think that if there were no black or brown players, there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough men to fill the teams?  Does she realize that entirely white groups of men used to successfully run around on fields, pointlessly chasing balls, with the same results as effected today (one team loses: one team wins)?  Got it, honey?  One team loses.  One team wins.  Or they &#8216;tie&rsquo;&hellip;or something&hellip; WHO CARES?</p>
<p>Oh, and before I&rsquo;m finished kvetching, I&rsquo;ve gotta comment on &#8216;reason&rsquo; #3.  &#8220;Still trying to sell that home?&#8221; Has it dawned on this woman that elderly people stuck in unsellable homes are generally stuck in them because those homes are in neighborhoods rendered undesirable by brown and black people?</p>
<p>So, elderly people trying to sell (probably because of black and brown neighbors) and move to safe places (you know, the kinds of places which are safe because they are NOT served by the public transportation whites no longer dare use) should be THANKFUL that the only people who will buy their houses in now-blighted communities&hellip;the only people who will consider buying those homes are black or hispanic?</p>
<p>For these things we should be THANKFUL?</p>
