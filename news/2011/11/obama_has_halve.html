			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edwin Mora, CNS News, November 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration has slashed spending on border fencing, infrastructure and technology, cutting it by more than half since it peaked under President George W. Bush in fiscal 2008, according to a Government Accountability Office report.</p>
<p>In 2008, according to GAO, the federal government spent more than $1.3 billion on border security fencing, infrastructure and technology. In 2011, it spent $573 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protection has said that as of June it had fenced only 649 miles of the nearly 1,954-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border  &mdash;  leaving more than 1,300 miles of that border unfenced.</p>
<p>The November 2011 GAO report refers to this category of federal spending by the acronym BSFIT.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over $4.7 billion has been appropriated for BSFIT activities from fiscal years 2007 through 2011,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>The report breaks the figure down for the five consecutive fiscal years (the 12-month period from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 of the following year)  &mdash;  $1.188 billion for FY2007, $1.303 billion for FY2008, $845 million for FY2009, $800 million for FY2010 and $573 million for FY2011.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s never going to be built. It&rsquo;s never going to be finished. It&rsquo;s never going to be manned or maintained. It hasn&rsquo;t been finished in the 50 years they&rsquo;ve been promising it. It makes sense for Obama to kill this phantom &#8216;fence&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>Aside from halving the budget, they have also cripple states&rsquo; initiatives to deal with illegal immigration themselves.  It is a de facto soft amnesty program for those that are here, and a invite to those that are not.  </p>

		<p>Organized crime makes money off drugs.  Chicago is noted as a home town for the mob.  Obama comes from Chicago and walked right into the Presidentcy.  Obama obviously wants an open border with Mexico.  The reason should be obvious.  Money.</p>

		<p>Why do we have trouble with illegals?  Because there are jobs and crime opportunities in the U.S.  What laws we have are being either ignored or laxly enforced.  Democratic pols want Hispanic voters, and Republican ones want cheap labor.  White voters must show them that we will not tolerate either view. <br>
For most of American history, we haven&rsquo;t had much trouble with illegals because we had a social and legal environment that wasn&rsquo;t welcoming.  Migrants were tolerated if they didn&rsquo;t threaten citizens&rsquo; jobs or prey upon them.  <br>
If we had a law mandating imprisonment of Americans hiring illegals  &mdash;  a law that was actually enforced  &mdash;  it would make a world of difference.  It&rsquo;s already been shown that illegals flee like rats when states are even on the verge of passing laws against them.  If there are few American jobs for illegals, most will leave voluntarily, and fewer will come in the first place.</p>

		<p>America should decide who comes into the country.<br>
America can and should enforce its borders:<br>
Secure the borders with fences and more border patrol with air assets.<br>
Enforce existing law now.<br>
Deport illegals and visa overstays.  Start with the illegals in jail and gang members from other countries, e.g. MS13.<br>
Make E-Verify mandatory.<br>
Pass amendment to eliminate automatic citizenship.  (Actually that Amendment is more than likely misinterpreted, new borns must be &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221; (America).  Illegals clearly do not qualify.<br>
Deny all benefits to illegals: school, welfare, Medicaid,Medicare, Social Security.  (Except health emergencies)<br>
Deny driver&rsquo;s licenses and college tuition.</p>

		<p>As a legal UK to US resident now married to a Boone Girl &hellip; I say CLOSE THE F&rsquo;IN BORDER.</p>
<p>The freakin&rsquo; Berlin Wall worked! Hadrians wall worked! The Great Wall of China worked! Why is it so difficult?</p>
<p>The truth is, it is not difficult &hellip; don&rsquo;t build a fence, build a feckin&rsquo; wall, mine the land around it, post signs &hellip; &#8220;if you cross this you will likely die &hellip; your choice!&#8221; When our troops are available, post them at it for sentry duty. It is so G D simple - protect the United States of America!</p>
<p>I guarantee that the wall and security will cost far less than the economic effect on the American People, you know, the obvious loss of jobs, welfare costs, policing costs, health costs, multilingual print costs, education costs &hellip;</p>

		<p>Reply to sick of It #11:</p>
<p>The fence will not be built because it would actually keep illegal invaders from Mexico out! That is the only reason it will not be built. This government does not intend to keep these people out, not at the border, or the interior of this country. </p>
<p>If an illegal invader can make it past the border undetected, they are home free, with any number of &ldquo;sanctuary&#8221; cities awaiting them, providing the necessary &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; for them to begin their criminal activity.</p>
<p>This issue in my opinion will eventually lead to a civil war in this country if our government does not stop this invasion on their own. <br>
