<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=366441">Judge Endorses Censorship of Old Glory</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Unruh, World Net Daily, November 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The same federal judge who said it was perfectly fine for a homosexual judge in a long-term relationship with another man to rule on a dispute over homosexual marriage  &mdash;  a ruling from which he might benefit  &mdash;  now has concluded that it&rsquo;s all right for a school to censor clothing displaying the American flag because there were students who threatened violence against those wearing the clothing.</p>
<p>The judge, James Ware, of the federal court in the Northern District of California&rsquo;s San Francisco Division, has dismissed a complaint brought against the Morgan Hill Unified School District where the Old Glory theme on student T-shirts had been censored.</p>
<p>He found that it was reasonable because there were students who apparently hated the emblem enough to threaten with violence other students who were wearing it, and the censorship was &#8220;equal&#8221; even though the Mexican flag was not also censored because no one threatened violence against the students wearing that emblem.</p>
<p>The case was brought by parents of the students who had been ordered by school officials either to change their Old Glory shirts, turn them inside out or go home. They sued, alleging constitutional violations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only those students whose Old Glory-based clothing prompted threats of violence were ordered to change, he noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plaintiffs have offered no evidence demonstrating that students wearing the colors of the Mexican flag were likely to be targeted for violence, and that officials treated all students for whose safety they feared in the same manner,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here &hellip; [the school officials] have provided a non-discriminatory basis for asking plaintiffs to remove their American flag attire. Defendants have put forth significant evidence demonstrating that plaintiffs (wearing the American flag colors) were asked to change clothes in order to protect their own safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;The undisputed evidence shows that plaintiffs were the only students on campus whose safety was threatened that day,&#8221; Ware said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dispute developed on May 5, 2010, when several Live Oak High School students wore patriotic T-shirts, shorts and shoes to school bearing various images of the U.S. flag.</p>
<p>They were told by Assistant Principal Miguel Rodriguez that they could not wear their pro-U.S. T-shirts. According to the Rutherford Institute report, he lectured them about the Hispanic Cinco de Mayo holiday and said he&rsquo;d gotten complaints from Hispanic students about the apparel who said they were offended by the imagery on &#8220;their&#8221; day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attorneys say they will appeal.</p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s ruling said after Mexican students walked around the school with a Mexcian flag, &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; students also put an image of a U.S. flag on a tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;One Mexican student shouted, &#8216;F  &mdash;  - them white boys, f  &mdash;  - them white boys,&rsquo;&#8221; the judge wrote.</p>
<p>When Rodriguez told him to stop using such language, the Mexican student said, &#8220;But Rodriguez, they are racist. They are being racist. F  &mdash;  - them white boys. Let&rsquo;s f  &mdash;  - them up.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge noted in another situation that a &#8220;male student&#8221; approached one of the plaintiffs and &#8220;shoved a Mexican flag at him.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is almost completely unbelievable but here&rsquo;s the story, in black and white&hellip;and brown.</p>
<p>It is amazing to me that one group is legally told to stand down because another group threatened violence against the first!!!  Believe me, since May 2010, this story has not gone unnoticed and neither will the latest update on it.  What this judge is saying to the kids wearing the Old Glory shirts is, &#8220;hey, you provoked the Mexican-American kids simply by wearing a t-shirt, so you now cannot legally wear it.  But it&rsquo;s perfectly okay that they call you racial epithets and threaten violence.&#8221;  Gee, what a great message to be giving our youth.  UNREAL.</p>

		<p>From Wikipedia: &#8221; Judge Ware was reprimanded by the Judicial Council of the Northern District Court of California for fabricating the story of being the brother of Virgil Ware,[6] a 13 year old black boy shot by white teenagers in Alabama in 1963 on the same day as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. According to a story Judge Ware had told many audiences, he was riding his bike with his brother Virgil on the handlebars when Virgil was shot and killed by white racists.[7] The incident was a real one, however it happened to a different James Ware&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p><br>
So if there were white students who threatened Mexicans with violence for wearing the Mexican flag, that would have made everything OK? The &#8220;reasoning&#8221; of the above passage is so twisted as to be comical. It reads like satire of postmodern ultraliberal ethnomasochism. The &#8220;line of logic&#8221; being pursued here isn&rsquo;t just faulty, it&rsquo;s ridiculous. </p>
<p>But I have to admit that when I read it, I was picturing it coming from the mouth of an America-hating white San FranCrisco yuppie, possibly of a same-sex persuasion. So I was surprised when at the end I gazed upon AR&rsquo;s visual punchline, the photo of Judge James Ware. </p>
<p>Although in retrospect, perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised at all. When it comes to America-hating, even educated, successful, &#8220;intellectual&#8221; blacks like this one are every bit as virulent and hostile and dangerous as the most wild-eyed white Weatherman-type bomb-tosser. </p>
<p>And make no mistake: a decision like Judge Ware&rsquo;s could ONLY be made by someone who hates this country. Not someone who &#8220;wants to reform it.&#8221; Not &#8220;seeks to make it fairer for everybody.&#8221; Someone who HATES it. </p>

		<p>A shining example of why whites should regard all non-whites as potential enemies that are not to be trusted, and kept at a distance from our childrem. Not to mention why we cannot be ruled by anyone other than whites, not Mexicans, blacks, Jews, Muslims or anyone else who are racial and ethnic aliens to us. These Mexcians have no right to dictate what white American children wear, and this judge&rsquo;s ruling elevates the so-called rights of these hostile invaders over all white Americans. How can this not lead to an all our race war as well as a violent revolution against a corrupt, rapacious regime that puts judges like this one on the bench. Whites are still the majority here in the the I.S., but are already increasingly dispossessed and discriminated against. Imagine how much worse life will be for us when we are a minoorty everywhere in our former homeland, and what we will have to do to secure a future and freedom for American white children. If these Mexcians hate the American flag that much then go back to Mexcio. I personally view the Mexican flag with less regard than a roll of toilet paper at a roadside gas station.</p>

		<p>A better idea would be to ban Cinco de Mayo celebrations in American schools   &mdash;   it isn&rsquo;t even a real Mexican holiday, just a holiday for the booze industry to sell an ocean of tequila!!</p>
<p>Soon judges will rule that the American flag can be banned anywhere on school property; it seems we have a First Amendment right to burn the American flag, but not to display it.</p>
<p>About Judge Ware:</p>
<p><i>Ware&rsquo;s nomination unraveled amid an embarrassing scandal that ultimately resulted in a judicial reprimand, and Clinton withdrew his nomination of Ware on November 27, 1997.</i></p>
<p><i>In 1998, Judge Ware was reprimanded by the Judicial Council of the Northern District Court of California for fabricating the story of being the brother of Virgil Ware, a 13 year old black boy shot by white teenagers in Alabama in 1963 on the same day as the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.</i></p>
<p><i>According to a story Judge Ware had told many audiences, he was riding his bike with his brother Virgil on the handlebars when Virgil was shot and killed by white racists. The incident was a real one, however it happened to a different James Ware, as was discovered when Judge Ware&rsquo;s claim was published in the Alabama papers after he was nominated to the Ninth Circuit by President Bill Clinton.</i></p>
<p><i>Judge Ware was reprimanded but allowed to retain his lifetime appointment as district judge.</i></p>

<p>May 5th should be celebrated!!  May 5th, 1961, was the day that the first American achieved space flight with Alan B. Shepard in Freedom 7.   We should call it Alan B. Shepard day.</p>

		<p>Oh my. American students at an American school displaying the American flag? Regardless of what day they do so on, it is their right as Americans. Suggesting that American students should show cowardice on days that are &#8220;celebrated&#8221; by foreign nationals is insane. It is just another way to push guilt upon American children, White children in particular. </p>
<p>The school administrators are truly cowards for not suspending all the Mexican students who objected to the flag attire and threatened violence. That would have sent the proper message to them: &#8220;We can be tolerant up to a point&hellip;&#8221; But the message of: &#8220;Yes yes, we &#8216;evil&rsquo; White Americans, we will just roll over for you&hellip;pretty please&hellip;don&rsquo;t hurt us&hellip;we love burritos and tequila too!&#8221; </p>

		<p>So the American flag joins the Confederate flag as a despised symbol of Whiteness.</p>
<p>White Genocide is so much easier to accomplish if Whites are allowed no emblems, celebrations, or organizations around which a consciousness of Whiteness might form.</p>

		<p>No one is demanding that African countries flood themselves with non-Africans.</p>
<p>No one is demanding that Asian countries flood themselves with non-Asians.</p>
<p>But EVERY White country and ONLY White countries are being flooded with non-Whites, and if you object you are a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.</p>
<p>The proper name for this is White Genocide.</p>
<p>The mestizo race and the other non-White races that are pouring into this country will interbreed us out of existence as surely as the Spanish who poured into Mexico interbred the native races there out of existence to produce the mestizo race.</p>
<p>This process of White Genocide is encouraged by TV commercials that constantly show black men with blonde women (try watching some TV with the sound off&hellip;it makes VERY vivid what kind of images are being pushed into our brains constantly), as well as by support of interracial mixing and dating by all our other institutions. </p>
<p>The anti-Whites will continue to implement White Genocide by every measure possible, including the appointment of judges like this present one who (as Bon specifies in her helpful post above) seems to have a tenuous connection to reality and a very strong connection to his own minority victimhood and the cause of White Genocide.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m no legal scholar, but let me see if I can follow this. The judge says that since people wearing the flag were threatened with violence, the school is right in banning the flag. Oh, ok. Would the judge ban Mexicans if I threatened them with violence? That seems to be the twisted logic in the opinion. Naturally, brought to you by the good people of the most insane appeals court in the country - in SF. Incidentally, this is the same Judge Ware who was exposed back in the 90&rsquo;s for making up a story about how his brother was killed by white racists. Strangely, this minor setback doesn&rsquo;t seem to have impeded his rise to Chief Judge of a US District Court. Hmm, I wonder why&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Not surprised about the judge lying about the shooting.  I think this happens all the time. </p>
<p>On Sunday, 60 Minutes profiled UMBC and its president Freeman Hrabowski, who is black.  In the interview, Hrabowski claims that a white racist cop spat in his face when he was 12 years old.  Then the cop put Hrabowski in jail for a week for simply being at a civil rights protest !  And he was just 12 years old! </p>
<p>There are many examples of how blacks lie to vilify whites.  The recent &#8220;rape of Rosa Parks&#8221; story, the Tawana Brawley case, the Duke University &#8220;rape&#8221; case.  I believe that 95% of the rape stories during slavery are simply made up so that whites will forget how violent blacks are and feel sorry for them.  White guilt.  <br>

		<p>The socialist state of Mexifornia is gone, I don&rsquo;t think it will ever be truly American again. Sad that we have allowed the Reconquista to succeed there. What&rsquo;s next, N.M.? A.Z.? Will modern Texans fight for Texas like their forefathers did before them? It&rsquo;s hard to fight demographics, Americans of European descent are already the minority in those states and an adversarial federal government who would rather support Mexican interests over Americans certainly doesn&rsquo;t make things easier. </p>

<p>Both were wrong AFAIC, the &#8220;White&#8221; Judge Ware for over-ruling the will of the people of the state of California, the &#8220;Black&#8221; Judge Ware for abject stupidity.</p>

		<p>Twisted legal logic has been applied like this oftentimes in Canada or Europe.  Essentially, the judge or police shuts down the party who has had his free speech threatened solely due to the opposition&rsquo;s threats.  What we never hear about is whether or not the opposition is arrested/prosecuted for the threats, in fact even WND couldn&rsquo;t think hard enough to bring up that point.</p>
<p>For instance, I know Ann Coulter was prevented (by police) from speaking at a Canadian university after protests against her.  The reasoning?  Letting Coulter speak would further enrage the protestors and possibly lead to more violence.  The question of whether or not the police should be enforcing laws against mob behavior and threats of violence against Coulter never seemed to make it into the logic of so-called journalists.</p>
<p>Geert Wilders of the Netherlands was censored and put on trial for daring to speak out against Muslims  &mdash;  thus inciting hatred.  Of course, if a Muslim actually acts out his hatred toward Jews, Christians, or homosexuals this is swept under the rug by the mainstream press.</p>
<p>So it is sad to see that a school district in California decides not to punish the racist browns for the threats but instead tells the American kids that they cannot wear the American flag in their own country.  If we had any real white men left in this country this would never happen.  The judge would be impeached, the racist threats would stop as mass deportations would occur, and any objectors would be tried for sedition.</p>

		<p>The mestizo race and the other non-White races that are pouring into this country will interbreed us out of existence as surely as the Spanish who poured into Mexico interbred the native races there out of existence to produce the mestizo race.</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>No, the native races are still there. It was the Spaniards who were almost bred out of existence.</p>

<p>The CIA Factbook claims that Mexico&rsquo;s 100 million people are 9% white, 60% mestizo, 30% Indian, and 1% other. These are fairly arbitrary estimates. It could be that some of the whites and Indians are a little bit mixed, but not enough to show. </p>

		<p>Instead of banning the t-shirts from the school, they should have banned the threatening Mexican kids from the school. If they love Mexico so much, they can go back there, and the Mexicans can pay the billions of dollars a year which it costs to try to educate them. Kids like this are the reason why the public schools are no longer usable. They&rsquo;ve made the schools dangerous, disrupted the classrooms with their noise, and reduced the quality of the education because it has to be dumbed down for them.</p>

		<p>Neo and lamestream conservatives, and a couple of well known national conservative talk radio hosts who once worked in the Reagan White House, (won&rsquo;t mention Mark Levin and Laura Ingraham by name), are crying in their beer over this decision.  I regret to inform them all that their former boss/idol signed an immigration amnesty 25 years ago this past week.  If not for that and the 1965 immigration act, there would be very few Hispanics in the Morgan Hill District&rsquo;s high schools, and therefore, no racial tension relating to white students wearing American flag shirts.</p>
<p>Certainly, not a one will tell you that the judge is black.</p>

		<p>#7: You are right. The Students should just continue to wear their American flag shirts. </p>
<p>There was a News report about two months ago, where a 10 year old White boy was told that he could not have an American flag on his bicycle that he rode to School. The local American Legion Motocycle Club escorted this 10 year old boy on his next ride to School, with about 200 Veteran Motocycle riders, all with flags on their Harlys. </p>
<p>This occured in California, and I am wondering if it is the same School. The video that showed the boy, and the American Legion riders was on You Tube. </p>
<p>Maybe these same Veterans need to take another ride to this School, with American flags on their bikes, and see if any Mexican has got a gripe about it to them. I betting no. </p>

<p>No, the CIA Factbook says,</p>
<p>&#8220;mestizo (Amerindian-Spanish) 60%, Amerindian <i>or predominantly Amerindian</i> 30%, white 9%, other 1%&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/KtDV" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/KtDV</a></p>
<p>What portion of that 30% would you guess to be pure Amerindian? I would guess very much less than half. Pure Amerindians are nearly invisible in most of the country above Oaxaca, and except for the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas, where Amerindian blood is heavy, the remaining Amerindians in Mexico have been of almost no consequence in Mexico&rsquo;s political life since the presidency of Benito Juárez.</p>
<p>All that relies on my general knowledge of Mexico and I haven&rsquo;t carefully researched either it or the present demographics of Mexico to confirm it. (I hope to do that now, and I thank you for that, since we both should aim for precision and accuracy).</p>
<p>On our present course, the future U.S. population may or may not include 30% that will be <i>predominantly white</i>. Why &#8220;predominantly white&#8221; does not equate practically to &#8220;White&#8221; may be a separate long discussion, but one which my Southern grandmothers would have had no need for and I and probably most of us here really don&rsquo;t either! I imagine that I and most other Whites with long roots in the South may have a touch of non-White blood, and that doesn&rsquo;t disturb me at all. But the degree of mixture implied by the word &#8220;predominantly&#8221; does disturb me. I want to see White genes preserved in a race that is White, not preserved in a race that is only &#8220;predominantly White.&#8221;</p>
<p>And perhaps that dovetails with your point that the White population that arrived in Mexico was interbred even more thoroughly out of existence than the Amerindian population was. I would guess that there is a considerably larger fraction of the Mexican population than 1% that is &#8220;predominantly white&#8221;! But persons who are &#8220;predominantly white&#8221; generally don&rsquo;t look so white as persons who are predominantly Amerindian look Amerindian! At least by our own customary standards.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Let that whole state go belly up. Those hippie, elitist whites there let this happen while pointing the finger at the rest of America. Serves them right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I find comments like this extremely offensive. I live in California and I am not a hippie, elistist, liberal, druguser, etc. I&rsquo;m actually conservative and I own a business. I wish to stay here. This is my home and I refuse to be pushed out. In the past, Americans fought and died to save California from invasion, and we should do the same. I&rsquo;m not going to roll over, take my punishment, and die etc. I&rsquo;m going stay here, stay alive, fight and win. Do not take pleasure in losing California. Our misery is coming to your state soon, if it already hasn&rsquo;t. We need to stand up and fight for all of the U.S., including California, ESPECIALLY California.</p>
