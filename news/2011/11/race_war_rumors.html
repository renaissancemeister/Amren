			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eddie Garcia, KOB, November 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An assembly meant to celebrate cultural diversity at Highland High School Tuesday is being postponed due to racial tensions on campus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far no fights have been reported, only rumors.</p>
<p>KOB spoke with parent Troy Jarvis who said he sought out Highland High School as the ideal environment for his daughter Breanna.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we looked at Highland High School is that it was the most diverse school in the city and we wanted our children to be part of that,&#8221; Jarvis said.</p>
<p>A cultural celebration was schedule to happen Tuesday at Highland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there was such tension that was in the school, they were afraid to do it so they had to put it on hold,&#8221; said Highland Sophomore Breanna Jarvis.</p>
<p>Albuquerque Public Schools said racial tensions did in fact play a role in the postponement but also said the unrest is limited to a fraction of the students.</p>
<p>Rumors of a big rumble have kept the Albuquerque Police Department gang unit on campus this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rumors I&rsquo;ve heard are there was going to be a race war and they were coming on campus with weapons and they were going to target all the black girls first,&#8221; Breanna Jarvis said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Highland has great potential, it really does. I mean it just seems sometimes as a school we don&rsquo;t use it the way we should,&#8221; Breanna said.</p>

		<p>Because diverse elements of the student body couldn&rsquo;t get along, they canceled an assembly about diversity?  In liberal logic, this would be the perfect opportunity to go on with this shin dig (with an SPLC informational packet in each chair).  If the race conflict was Whites vs any sort of non-white, with Whites being the known primary aggressors, not only would this assembly have gone on, the school district would have flown in Morris Dees on the first class red eye flight from the Cayman Islands, their expense, not his.</p>

		<p>Notice how the story doesn&rsquo;t mention that the antagonists are most likely Mexicans because PC doctrine must never assign race to a racist unless that racist is white.  If it were whites instigating these problems, you can be assured that their skin color would be in the headline of the article.   </p>

<p>IMO this is the ONLY way to celebrate diversity because racial tentions and riots are the only things that happen with diversity!</p>
<p>#2 - Notice how the story doesn&rsquo;t mention that the antagonists are most likely Mexicans - </p>
<p>I disagree, from what I&rsquo;ve seen and heard its usually the blacks that are always the antagonists. Blacks don&rsquo;t get along with anybody including themselves. I went to school and have worked around both blacks and Mexicans and by far it was the blacks that always stirred the racial pot, whereas the Mexicans were more times than not aligned with the Whites.</p>

		<p>Once again, &#8220;most diverse&#8221; is code for &#8220;fewest Whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you used the actual definition of &#8220;diverse&#8221;, the most diverse city in the U.S. would probably be Honolulu, which has large populations of three distinct races - Whites, Asians, and Hawaiians. But of course, the label of &#8220;most diverse city in America&#8221; always goes to some place like East St. Louis, which isn&rsquo;t diverse at all in the true sense, but hey, it&rsquo;s 0% White! Honolulu will never get praised because it&rsquo;s missing the two whiniest, most violent, most hateful, and most coddled ethnic groups - blacks and Mexicans. The same two that are causing riots at this New Mexico school.</p>
<p>Honolulu also has a low crime rate. That must be a coincidence. Yeah, definitely just a coincidence.</p>

		<p>Having worked in schools with large populations of Mexicans and blacks, my conclusion based on extensive experience is that blacks usually cause these problems, they usually start the fights. </p>
<p>As far as blacks supporting illegal immigration, I don&rsquo;t think that very many blacks except Obama support illegal immigration. Some Mexican-Americans support Obama. The best interests of the two groups are opposed so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for them to support each other in any way. The only common ground that they might have might be that they hate Anglo-American whites. Otherwise their best interests are in conflict. Any cooperation between the groups is due to hatred of whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Highland has great potential, it really does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sobbing, Highland&rsquo;s parents said Highland was a good school that had been about to turn it&rsquo;s life around. Highland&rsquo;s teachers said Highland had made plans for a rewarding career in diversity training, and had wanted to give something back to the community.  &#8220;Young people looked up to Highland,&#8221; said Highland&rsquo;s Principal, Boomquisha Lateesha Jones. &#8220;Who knows what Highland might have become if Highland hadn&rsquo;t become the victim of senseless violence.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In answer to #8 Mr White, Blacks are, for the most part too ignorant to understand the ramifactions of this massive invasion.  I tried to talk to Blacks about all this 15 years ago during my union rep days and they just don&rsquo;t get it.  At the same time, Blacks I discussed this with were very concerned about Asians coming to their hoods and opening stores that charged too much for everything and didn&rsquo;t have to pay taxes.  Maybe it&rsquo;s just intelligent races that Blacks don&rsquo;t want coming here.  I think it&rsquo;s as simple as, anything Whitey doesn&rsquo;t like, must be OK.</p>

<p>I do not believe the average Black wants these invaders here. They are no more for it than are Whites. They just have bought off leaders just as Whites have. Al Sharpton is the equivalent of our WSJ types. When I was growing up in LA I remember seeing Black cooks, factory workers etc. I see none now. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t but I feel sorry for many of them. Their leaders have betrayed them. Well we know what that feels like.</p>

		<p>Expect more of the same with the &#8220;browning&#8221; of America. Blacks fantasize about forming a coalition with the Mestizos to gain political domination, but they don&rsquo;t seem to get along very well when pitted against one another. Tribal loyalty trumps grievance class solidarity. I am sure it has already been reported on here, but Hispanics have been systematically forcing out and murdering blacks who won&rsquo;t leave neighborhoods they are taking over one address at a time in LA.    </p>

		<p>The most politically minded blacks support amnesty and open borders. They are politically indocntrinated to agree with everything the liberal mainstream pontificates.  They also have a strong motivation to dilute the white population in any way the can. They do not think about long term consequences. For them, anything is better than having white men in charge. They will be horrified when the welfare and entitlements dry up.  </p>
<p>To be fair, I have met a small handful of blacks in the workforce who commented, &#8220;wow, we allow all of these people to enter our country, and they hate us. Why are we allowing this to happen?&#8221;.  Such viewpoints are small percentile of the group, but they do exist.</p>

<p>Poor Breanna. Sure, being deliberately sent into the most diverse school in the city by her parents is most likely not as bad as being beaten up or sexually abused by them. Then again, if she&rsquo;s not very lucky, she&rsquo;ll suffer because her parents honestly believe in some truly foolish things, and if she&rsquo;s very unlucky&hellip; Well, of course one quite possible end result is a potential recruit for AmRen. I&rsquo;ve thought for years that the only real talent the bonsai liberals have is shooting into their own feet, and this story is just another example.</p>

		<p>New Mexico has a very high crime rate, and lots of (new) gangs, very high hispanic population. I talk to whites and a black who lived down there. In schools you divide between Mexican or Native American. If your black you still have to &#8216;pick a side&rsquo;. Latino store clerks in Walmart will rip off your credit card numbers, petty crime etc&hellip; - Ive heard a lot of liberals also went down there in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, and came screaming back to their &#8216;White Wonder Land&rsquo; after a few months of &#8216;Diversity&rsquo;. <br>
Lots of nice little towns in New Mexico, but you have to be careful because of the drug trade. They may not like the gringo moving in. As usual, the more MONEY you have, the more you can insulate yourself from diversity.</p>

<p>Mexican gangs are kidnapping &#8216;undocumented workers&rsquo; and selling them as slave labor to the Chinese mafia. They are forced to work in underground factories hidden underground in a mountainous region of China. Illegal aliens are targeted because no one will report them as missing. </p>

		<p>Praising diversity is becoming the last gasp of the rainbow crowd who are desperately trying to fend off widespread racial clashes throughout the country that are spreading, especially in those areas where blacks and Hispanics are in close proximaty to one another.</p>
<p>The diversity dogs can try as many goofy tricks as they want, but it won&rsquo;t matter.  People prefer their own kind and all the high sounding phrases and mind control techniques aren&rsquo;t going to change their minds, at least for not very long.</p>
<p>This school is filled with the usual diversity buffoons and would make a great comedy skit for its unintended contrast:  As speaker after speaker in the auditorium lauds and praises diversity, the crowds outside are battling tooth and nail for turf control or whether they should be celebrating MLK day or Cinco de Mayo.</p>
<p>The greatest thing about opposing diversity is that all that is necessary to do in order to reverse it is to wait patiently and it will implode nicely all on its own.</p>
<p>Just wait until the economy transitions into a severe, long-lasting depression.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; schools might have to close, because it will become too dangerous for students to travel back and forth. </p>
<p>Please believe me.  That is not a far out statement.</p>

		<p>Funny when I was in Albuquerque almost twenty years ago, I don&rsquo;t remember seeing any blacks. I saw plenty of Chicanos, Mexicans and Native Americans but no blacks. I was under the impression that there were few black people in New Mexico. I guess I was wrong in that assumption. I had a pleasant visit back then, but I&rsquo;m sure Albuquerque has changed like everywhere in America. </p>

		<p>We have the same problems in Los Angeles&hellip;Mexicans attacking black kids, even murdering them.  School administrators always lie about it and deny that &#8220;racial tensions&#8221; were involved. </p>
<p>The only silver lining to all of this black vs. brown racial hatred is that they have no dirty rotten white racists to blame for their problems.  The same blacks who tirelessly worked to &#8220;integrate&#8221; white schools are not so  anxious to go to school with Mexicans who are not influenced by &#8220;white guilt.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>Sardonicus: The same for me. I was in Albuquerque in the late 70s and mid 80s and never saw blacks. There was also very few Mexicans and most of the AmerIndians were far and few between to even notice. The people I met were Anglos and Spaniards who were descendents of the Conquistadors. One American of Spanish ethnicity told me that Mexicans are generally looked down upon by them and as such do not come to NM but to AZ, TX &amp; CA. Your right, things have changed and not for the better.</p>

		<p>I believe the liberals must be fuming that they can no longer blame whites for racial attacks. Minorities are being attacked in every major city&hellip;but by other minorities. They would love to blame freckled faced white kids for bullying and racist attacks. Unfortunately for the liberals, there simply are no more whites left in big cities. I am sure that the media will recycle these incidents in the form of TV movies. They will change the race of the racist attackers to white and all of the victims will be minorities. Gay actors in Hollywood, working as waiters, will jump at the chance to play a part in their own genocide. You will see the movies on Lifetime for Women, Bravo, A&E;, and the other garbage channels.  </p>
<p>When liberals have no facts to support their agenda, they make up fiction. They use such fiction as left-wing, anti-white propaganda. Most of the general public is not that intelligent. Whatever people see in the media, they will accept as fact and reality. Even there is a disclaimer that it is fictitious, people will still consider this Hollywood drivel reality.  The rabble is driven by emotions and noise, not by facts. Liberals controlling the media use this device effectively to promote their destructive agenda.</p>
<p>I am sure our enemies believe that I am some ignorant, country white person sitting in my basement in the South somewhere. When I was younger,  I actually lived and worked in Hollywood, and I was a liberal.  I did this for about ten years. I knew celebrities, producers, directors, professional athletes, etc. Not everyone was so bad, but it was the depths of evil and hell.  I really see the media for what it is, and I know first hand.</p>

		<p>I m amazed at how many on here take the black side. On black Friday, I was in line when two women started arguing over a trivial matter. The black woman called the white one a b88h and f88ing racist cracker, emboldened by her victim&rsquo;s meekness she even hurled racial slurs at all white people around. I never felt so bad for someone like I felt for that white woman even though I m a non-white. Have you ever been demeaned and called a cr88ker by a hispanic?</p>

<p>I have also notice the hallmark channel doing the same.</p>
<p>I watched Dr. Phil Friday, November 25th. I very rarely watch his show but this caught my eye since I knew it would just be more propaganda for the White sheeple to soak into their brains.</p>
<p> This movie will be playing on the Hallmark Channel. They had an EX skinhead ( of course) and his wife on the show talking about all the &#8220;hate&#8221; they once had and have since reformed, but are now being threatened by the skinhead/nazis daily, (another, of course)&hellip;.this movie is all lovey dovey about being a &#8220;Christian&#8221; and all religions/races coming together. </p>
<p>Of course the blacks/ black preacher/rabbi will be the heroes in this film and show the rest of us how we should &#8220;forgive&#8221; and become ONE&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it odd that they NEVER have an ex-BLACK racist who calls for the death of all Whites on their shows? Always these stupid &#8220;White&#8221; converted &#8220;ex-nazis&#8221;&hellip;since Whites are the most evil race on the planet, according to the media/Hollywood.</p>

		<p>We have to get in the game and learn to play the game. </p>
<p>So far the massive Mestizo immigration hasn&rsquo;t resulted in many/any Black political offices changing hands - exception being LA mayor&rsquo;s office, but that&rsquo;s just one job.</p>
<p>The Lib/Mins game the system to redistrict areas from White to Hispanic, never from Black to Hispanic. Even when Chicago loses 200,000 Black resident&rsquo;s from 2000 to 2010 it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in reducing Black political power (some might argue Blacks can never be elected mayor in Chicago again, but that hasn&rsquo;t happened since the 1980s)</p>
<p>Black political/intellectual/cultural elites are honed in to Hate White people first, keep/increase Black power second. Things like working class Blacks losing most hopes for living wage jobs against Mexican immigrants, that just doesn&rsquo;t factor in to their thinking.</p>
<p>We need to get active in arguing for all kinds of cuts in Black pandering because there are now more Mexicans than Blacks. We need to learn how Lebanese Christians still survive, are big players in Labanese politics even though their demographics have plummeted from where they were ~ 50% in the 1960s to where they have to be less than 25% today.</p>

<p>And the White neighborhoods are 100 percent safer than they were 20 years ago because the blacks have left. West los Angeles used to be pretty dangerous because the black predators used the freeways to swarm up from Compton, Inglewood and S Central and rob, murder and rape near the freeway off ramps.</p>
<p>Now we can go shopping after dark and get home without being robbed, raped or followed home and raped and pillaged.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, the farther your home and shopping center are from a freeway off ramp, the safer you are. Unfortunately, most shopping centers are located convenient to freeways.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t have feelings of pity or sympathy for the blacks getting targetted by the Hispanics.  How long have blacks moved into white areas and harrassed whites?  Aren&rsquo;t these the same blacks wanting other minorities to &#8216;unite&rsquo; with them against whites?  As an earlier poster said, they can&rsquo;t blame this on whites right now, but they will always find a way (slavery, colonialism, etc).  Best whites can do is stay away from them, plan for the future, learn self-defense moves, stay in good shape, buy some fireams, etc.  Don&rsquo;t look for trouble, but be on the defense.</p>

Troy Jarvis wanted his daughter to attend the school with the least amount of blacks and incompetent teachers. Smart whites don&rsquo;t want diversity in their schools because they know their children&rsquo;s&rsquo; education will suffer.

<p>Actually, the attempts by hispanic gangs in LA to intimidate blacks in areas where they (blacks) are still a demographic factor have mostly been embarrassing, and at times disastrous (like in the early 90s in Venice when numerous hispanic gang members and civilians were slaughtered by a local black gang before a police and community leaders were able to broker a truce). In reality, hispanics won inner city LA primarily through peaceful means: outcompeting blacks in the job market; buying up houses and apartments and refusing to rent to blacks. Keep in mind, LA was far more dangerous for blacks in the 80s and early 90s during the height of black gang wars than during any subsequent period.</p>
<p>What hispanic gangs <i>have</i> been mostly effective at is keeping blacks from getting footholds in established hispanic neighborhoods. That&rsquo;s what was going on in the high profile cases from Hawaiian Gardens, Canoga Park, Harbor Gateway and Highland Park.</p>

<p>True. I saw that also. There used to be a show with an English nanny. Now we have a black one showing Whites how to control their children? Maybe she needs to go into all these millions of unwed black mother&rsquo;s homes and do some serious lecturing.</p>
<p>There was also a show on TV called, Wife Swap. They had many black couples and White couples swapping wives for 2 weeks so they could &#8220;learn&#8221; from each other on how to raise their families. The White family with the &#8220;swapped black woman&#8221;, usually showed a backward, hick, White family and a middle class black &#8220;wife&#8221; who was disgusted with the way the White family lived and raised their children.</p>
<p>Anything to make Whites look like a bunch of lowlifes and blacks as their savior has been the theme of movies and TV shows in the last few decades. Whitey is shown as the most ignorant, stupid, lazy, racist, bigot, evil race on earth is the theme from Hollywood and TV. But, look at the source from which it came and you will have your answer.</p>

		<p>Of course the blacks started it. Blacks are almost always the instigators in public education settings. Anyone that&rsquo;s worked in public education would have to admit this truth even if they didn&rsquo;t want to.  That was true when I was a kid and it&rsquo;s true today. Nothing has changed in that regard for the better.  Public Ed has adhered to diversity as a goal to the point where physical safety cannot be expected in public schools and physical injury, even death, have become excusable and &#8220;acceptable losses&#8221;.  Get your kids out of the public education system.  Every fight, every injury, every death is met with the same the indifferent &#8220;Gee, that&rsquo;s a shame&#8221; type of response and yet, you will notice that nothing will change as a result. They cannot make the necessary changes without abandoning the doctrine of diversity. Their indifference to violence, for the sake of diversity, has normalized it and this indifference is a symptom and signal of a larger institutional failing. </p>

<p>Poster #47 asked about this.  I live in Los Angeles.  I don&rsquo;t think it was a systematic race war as was the takeover by blacks of the Portero Hill section of San Francisco in the 1940&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s.  It was more a gradual think.  Hispanics moved into the black neighborhoods because they were cheaper.  </p>
<p>In addition, from about 1975 to 2000 the city of Los Angeles got hold of some federal money and was practically giving away mortgages in the black areas to any respectable people they could con into moving into those neighborhoods.  There was an incentive program for affirmative action black police officers.<br>
The city would give black police officers a house in Watts and or S. Central.  It didn&rsquo;t take.</p>
<p>Blacks took advantage of sectioh 8 and cheap mortages in Lancaster, Palmdale, Riverside and San Bernadino counties. The affirmative action civil service blacks thug children turned these areas into new black ghettoes.</p>
<p>The hispanics were able to defend themselves against black crime<br>
without every federal judge and ADL SPLC lawyer around charging them with hate crime.</p>
<p>Unfortunetly, there are still plenty of blacks in Los Angeles. But the hispanics have reduced their numbers.  The good thing about hispanic immigration is that the neighorhoods where black predators got on the freeway to rape and pillage White neighborhoods are now hispanic.</p>
<p>As always, as the black population declines, crime declines.</p>

		<p>It was back in the 80&rsquo;s when Jesse Jackson was calling for solidarity between blacks and hispanics in a fight against the corporate white empire. I remember seeing the old race baitor actually dressed in a poncho and sombrero, riding in some ethnic parade in Southern California about twenty years on MSM evening news. The sound bite of a speech he made at the event was typical anti-white black babble. Perhaps the reverand should come to Albuquerque and mediate the situation. Then again, after all these years, JJ might have finnally realized that browns, just like their yellow counterparts, have no use for him or his race. </p>

Btw, the poster who said all Hispanics have black blood, pick up a book or two and read. All you&rsquo;re doing is giving into the self-hating libtards who would love to see blacks and Hispanics as one&hellip;&hellip;.one against evil Whitey.<br>
Expect to see this violence continue and spread.<br>
I for one am so damn glad that blacks are getting a taste of their own medicine. Since we (Whites) won&rsquo;t do anything to stand up for ourselves, at least we can enjoy the blacks getting it back.<br>

<p>You are part of the problem for White realists. Hispanics are almost as bad as the blacks! They commit so many crimes and their gangs alone cost us billions for the mayhem they create! Go live in Mexico and take your hispanic friends with you. PLEASE.</p>
<p>As for Whites not being able to do what the hispanics do, I guess you are ignorant of the hate laws against Whites ONLY? Whites are not allowed to defend themselves against any MINORITY in this country any longer. You do remember that term, RACIST, don&rsquo;t you? Hispanics are not labeled racist, WE are.</p>

<p>No Anon56, I&rsquo;m not part of the problem. I&rsquo;m just a realist. As I&rsquo;ve said before, hard cores like YOU want to despise anyone not White. The only &#8220;people&#8221; I see causing DIRECT trouble to us are the blacks&hellip;.as been the case forever. <br>
Would I prefer an all-White country, YES!!! Is that reality? NO.<br>
Are these Hispanic gangs, etc bad news, of course! However, bs all you want, they are NOT targeting Whites. <br>
I know plenty of Hispanics (various groups) and they all hate blacks and have no problem with Whites&hellip;.except for those who hate them of course. <br>
You ever hear about a White attacked by a Hispanic flash mob? (don&rsquo;t lie either). How about a Chinese flash mob? An Indian one? lol<br>
As for us not standing up for ourselves because of hate laws, that may be some of the reason, but not all of it. We just don&rsquo;t stick together and that&rsquo;s the SAD truth. <br>
As I said many times, we can&rsquo;t even handle the 13% population of blacks. You want to be enemies with the Hispanics, Asians, etc too? Great plan. No really, great plan. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Btw, the poster who said all Hispanics have black blood, pick up a book or two and read. All you&rsquo;re doing is giving into the self-hating libtards who would love to see blacks and Hispanics as one&hellip;&hellip;.one against evil Whitey.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think I said &#8220;practically&#8221; all of them have African blood, and  it&rsquo;s true. Particularly when looking at the hispanic groups that make up the bulk of hispanic-americans  &mdash;  Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans  &mdash; ,this has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in numerous genetic studies. I can dig up a few if you&rsquo;d like, or you could just google it yourself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not &#8220;giving in&#8221; to anyone. I&rsquo;m just using FACTS to interpret reality. The vast majority of hispanics DO have African blood. This is hardly in question to anyone who is familiar with the data. I suspect blacks sense this on a subconscious level, and feel a racial affinity with them. Some hispanic groups, like Puerto Ricans (at least in the US, and not all of them, obviously), seem to feel a racial affinity with blacks. This will only increase as hispanics and blacks continue to interbreed. If this gives some liberals glee, so what. I won&rsquo;t shape my model of reality around what pleases or displeases liberals.</p>

		<p>ANON 59, as far as I&rsquo;ve read, the average Mexican (I&rsquo;ll start with them since they are most prevalent) is primarily of European and Asian mixed decent. They also may have (possibly) 1-5% African. So, SOME may have a minute amount. If you want to play a 1% rule, technically you can say some have African in them.</p>
<p>The truth is, many of us may have minute amounts of things we don&rsquo;t even realize. Supposedly, we all originate from one place. I don&rsquo;t care what that place is. I look at what we have evolved into over the last 20,000+ years.</p>
<p>Obviously, some groups have truly evolved, while others (blacks) have not. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in NY and yes, Dominicans and Puerto Ricans are a different story. Most certainly do have black blood in them. </p>
<p>As for other groups such as Cubans, it really depends. I&rsquo;m not into saying every Cuban, for example, is part black just because some are. Many of the Cubans I have met are clearly NOT black. They often look Italian in fact. Same goes for Puerto Ricans. </p>
<p>Sorry but other than Dominicans, most Hispanics are of European and Asian decent, not black. </p>
<p>Dark skin does not automatically mean they have black blood (not saying that&rsquo;s what YOU implied). Hispanics, even Asians like Vietnamese, etc. are simply dark because they live in a hot, sunny climate. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to say other than I despise blacks&hellip;.BLACKS. Oh, and all the Whites who continue to coddle them. Those are the two groups who I have truly ruined this country and world. </p>
<p>For those who hate all the other groups too, I&rsquo;d preserve my energy for those two groups I mentioned cause they are the ones who truly screwed this world up. If not for them, things would be so different.</p>
<p>Anyway, I love this site and understand and respect everyone&rsquo;s opinion on here, though I don&rsquo;t agree of course). </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just &#8220;some,&#8221; it&rsquo;s nearly all of them. I&rsquo;m not trying to tell anyone how this should make them feel about Mexicans, but that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for other groups such as Cubans, it really depends. I&rsquo;m not into saying every Cuban, for example, is part black just because some are. Many of the Cubans I have met are clearly NOT black. They often look Italian in fact. Same goes for Puerto Ricans.</p>

<p>The admixture is more visible in some than in the others, but it&rsquo;s there in all of them.</p>
