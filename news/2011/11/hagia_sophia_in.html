			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Trend, October 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, which was earlier a Patriarchal Orthodox Cathedral and later a mosque, and now a museum, may once again become an active mosque, the Sabah newspaper reports.</p>
<p>Repairs are underway. A mimbar  &mdash;  a platform for the imam  &mdash;  is planned to be built in the museum.</p>
<p>Earlier, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said during a visit to the museum that fundamental changes should be made in Hagia Sophia.</p>
<p>Hagia Sophia was built in Constantinople, now Istanbul, in 537. After Mehmet II conquered the city in 1453, the church turned into a mosque.</p>

		<p>As I have always asked the the subject of Columbus and the American conquest come up, &#8220;What happened in 1453?&#8221;</p>
<p>Right there in that picture, you can see physical evidence of the civilization build by Christians that were displaced by conquest.</p>
<p>If we are asked to give land back to the Indians, I ask when are the Turks going to give back Constantinople, as well as the rest of Turkey?</p>
<p>The same could be said of most of the Middle East and North Africa.</p>

		<p>The Grand Turkey wants entry into the European Union, right? So tell the Grand Turkey to do this one thing, just this one little thing. Restore the Hagia Sophia again to the status of a church, remove those damned minarets and allow for religious services once per year and that is all. What ever the Grand Turkey wants he can have if he does that one little thing. See what happens.</p>

<p>Has the last 1500 years taught you nothing? There&rsquo;s no such thing as letting bygones be bygones when it comes to the muzzies. While you say, &#8220;Heck, just let them have Byzantine&#8221; they&rsquo;re busy plotting more conquests. There&rsquo;s no reasoning with them. They treat peace as a tactic. <i>Islam delenda est.</i></p>

		<p>Deniz #4 is correct right up the where he says, &#8220;This is irrelevant to Amren, outdated and unworthy of discussion&#8221;.</p>
<p>I very strongly disagree. I would assume that Deniz like most other followers of Amren are very concerned about the future of our white and nominally Christian civilization and associated lifestyle. The whole saga of Hagia Sofia is about the conquest of Christianity by the sword of Islam. It was a conquest that was halted only some 400 years ago, but also a conquest that now has begun again in no uncertain terms. Deniz should be very concerned.</p>
<p>Turkey which hopes to join the EU and become part of the West now wants to turn what was one of the most magnificent buildings of Eastern Christianity into a Mosque. This is symbolic of Islamic assertivness on the grandest scale, we should all be concerned, very concerned.</p>
<p>As to my statement that Islam is still out to conquer the (Christian) West, I am sure many followers and supporters of Amren are very concerned about the inroads that Islam is making into American life, I too am very concerned about what is happening (re Islam) to Australia as well. I feel that this is a topic which should continue to be discussed on Amren.</p>

		<p>Turkish support for entry into the EU keeps declining. Perhaps they want to be successful on their own, as the current EU is an economic failure. Also, I can imagine headstrong, traditional Muslims don&rsquo;t want liberal outsiders telling them their business.  Turks already immigrate to Western Europe, fairly unabated. Why would they want to give up their sovereignty?</p>

		<p> Hagia Sophia belongs to Turkey by right of conquest. It has been in their hands since 1453. I don&rsquo;t care what the Turkish authorities decide to do with it. It will always remain a Tourist attraction. Religion is important, but white survival is more important for American Renaissance.</p>

		<p>Hagia Sophia and the blue mosque are the same.</p>
<p>Here is the hymn the Byzantines sang at the last mass.  Most historians claim the superior Turkish cannons were responsible for the Greek defeat.  Most never mention that the cannons were cast and managed by a Hungarian christian traitor who fought against the Greeks all his life.</p>
<p>The Greeks fought the Turks for the next 400 years.  We Whites bow our heads and as our own traitors welcome our enemies.</p>
<p><br>
 The Last Mass in Hagia Sofia, the haunting Greek folk song about the ceremony that was actually held at midnight, May 28, 1453, two hours before the final Turkish assault began: </p>
<p> God rings the bells, earth rings the bells, the sky itself is ringing, </p>
<p>The Holy Wisdom, the Great Church, is ringing out the message,</p>
<p>Four hundred sounding boards sound out, and two and sixty bells.</p>
<p>For every bell there is a priest, and for every priest a deacon.</p>
<p>To the left the emperor is singing, to the right the patriarch, </p>
<p>And all the columns tremble with the thunder of the chant.</p>
<p>And as the emperor began the hymn to the Cherubim,</p>
<p>A voice came down to them from the sky, from the archangel&rsquo;s mouth:</p>
<p>Cease the Cherubic hymn and let the sacred objects bow;</p>
<p>Priests take the holy things away, extinguish all the candles;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s will has made our city now a Turkish city.</p>
<p>But send a message to the West, and let them send three ships:</p>
<p>The first to take the Cross, the second to remove the Gospel,</p>
<p>The third, the finest, shall rescue for us our holy altar&hellip;</p>
<p>The Holy Virgin was distressed, the very icons wept.</p>
<p>Be calm, beloved Lady, be calm and do not weep for them;</p>
<p>Though years, though centuries shall pass, they shall be yours again.</p>

<p>Except that the small numbers of Christians (and Jews, or anyone not a Muslim) in &#8220;traditional&#8221; Muslim nations are the result of the practice of Islam itself.  This provides a preview of what an increasingly Muslim West would be like.  Just combine it with the story on the Muslim Rape Gangs in Britain that are systematically destroying the white race through its female youth as just ONE aspect, and the relevance of this article is plain.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I thought that Hagia Sophia was a World Heritage Site and therefore marked for preservation.  Holding Islamic services regularly (5 times a day) might interfere with its role as a museum.  What you do think?</p>

<p>The Greeks won the first encounter. The city fell in 1453. Just remember that they don&rsquo;t give up and the complete destruction of the West is their ultimate goal even if it takes hundreds of years. Unfortunately the pace of their takeover has sped up in recent years.</p>

___</p>
<p>Of course they are not. Refresh your knowledge, dear Margaret:</p>
<p>The Sultan Ahmed Mosque is a historical mosque in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey and the capital of the Ottoman Empire (from 1453 to 1923). The mosque is popularly known as the Blue Mosque for the blue tiles adorning the walls of its interior. It was built from 1609 to 1616, during the rule of Ahmed I. </p>
<p><br>
In contrast to:<br>
Hagia Sophia is a former Orthodox patriarchal basilica, later a mosque, and now a museum in Istanbul, Turkey. From the date of its dedication in 360 until 1453, it served as the Greek Patriarchal cathedral of Constantinople, except between 1204 and 1261, when it was converted to a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople of the Western Crusader established Latin Empire. The building was a mosque from 29 May 1453 until 1931, when it was secularized. It was opened as a museum on 1 February 1935<br>

<p>Sorry, it is no longer YOURS. It is ours BY CONQUEST as Australia is white BY CONQUEST (I don&rsquo;t care whether it is multicultural or not, it&rsquo;s not my business). If you want to take it back, you can declare war on us and try to reconquer Istanbul.</p>

You&rsquo;re right. We do not need an undemocratic, highly centralized, Soviet style superstructure that dictates us what to do.</p>

___<br>
Muslim Rape Gangs are almost exclusively of Pakistani origin. There is no such a thing in Germany where the most Muslims are Turks. Don&rsquo;t associate these pedophiles with my kinsmen. They might be not perfect educated and a little less intelligent then Europeans but it doesn&rsquo;t make them sex maniacs.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>No brother, it is not our church anymore.  We lost it and they won it. Unless we are willing to take it back the same way, that is a fact of war.  You sound just like those delusional Mexicans who keep claiming that the Southwest belongs to them because it was once part of Mexico. They lost it and now it belongs to us, end of the story.</p>
<p>We have no right to tell others what to do in their country, just like they have no right to tell us what to do in ours.  Stop the hypocrisy all of you here, and realize that the only thing that matters to Whites now is to preserve the native and conquered lands we still own.<br>

		<p>How terrible, though sadly the tragedy occurred in 1453. Even if the Hagia Sofia was restored to a church it wouldn&rsquo;t change the history of rape, destruction, and slaughter of Ottoman conquest. As much as I adore the Byzantine Empire and all the glory that she was, she is gone and long since destroyed, a few crumbling ruins are the only remains of a once glorious city that stands no more. Constantinople is gone, and most of that city&rsquo;s creators (Greeks) are gone as well. Maybe one day such a territory will be restored to the Western world, but that is of no concern right now, when we are losing Paris, London, Berlin, Rome, New York, Toronto, etc., etc.<br>
One thing I would like is if these anti-Western nations would turn over our art. What use do these Muslims have with Christian Byzantine art or Ancient classical statues? They do not and never will, belong to them, but belong rightfully to the Western world. If the Hagia Sofia is to be turned into a mosque, at least let us take away what is left of her Western past, preventing them from a similar fate of that of Byzantium. </p>

		<p>AmRen is at its worst when talking about Islam. Scandinavians understand when Muslim immigrants are a problem, and when they are not. Americans who get all jittery about Islam are mostly just ignorant. Folks, the issue in the US is the &#8220;black undertow&#8221; problem. Focus on that and your wisdom is worth listening to.<br>
