			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen, November 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most Americans still believe in the need for profiling and feel it should be used to determine who is searched at airports.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 60% of American Adults say profiling - the use of factors such as race, ethnicity and overall appearance to determine the subjects of security checks - is necessary in today&rsquo;s society.  Twenty-seven percent (27%) disagree and feel profiling is an unnecessary violation of civil rights.  Another 13% are not sure.</p>

		<p>A million years of evolution has given humans the ability to sort through massive amounts of data and derive patterns.  This ability, known by some as &#8220;profiling&#8221; helped us survive.  </p>
<p>We profile many thing, such as large carnivores, dangerous currents, deep water, thin ice, old, foul-smelling food, and people.  Yet, Political Correctness tells us to ignore these mental processes that aided our survival.  </p>

		<p>As Anonymous #1 points out, the other 40% are minorities and the most diehard of DWLs. The 60% are those who follow on the 3 million year path of hominid evolution-strangers are a threat and should be profiled. The 40% that oppose profiling are those that want to see us victimized or part of the alien groups that cause the danger. <br>
It really is foolish to stop and frisk octogenarian White ladies when a far disproportionate amount of crime is committed by young black and Hispanic men, and terrorims is largely monopolized by Arab Muslims. In fact when you look at the relative size of the immigrant populace and the fact that we come across crimes committed by legal and illegal immigrants every day, it is far more prudent to profile black and brown foreigners than blondes from Iowa.</p>

		<p>Racial profiling is:</p>
<p>• Encouraged</p>
<p>When applying Affirmative Action programs<br>
When responding to census questions<br>
When creating ethnic affinity and professional groups<br>
When performing medical exams</p>
<p>• Discouraged</p>
<p>When applied to suspected criminals. </p>

		<p>Profiling of all types is (or should be) the core essence of effective law enforcement. Perhaps nowhere is its lack more evident than by airport Homeland Security personnel, who are required to treat pre-school kids and elderly grandmothers exactly as they would some surly-looking Middle Eastern camel-jockey in flowing robes.</p>
<p>And we wonder why the rest of the world thinks we&rsquo;re cowering and frightened idiots.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, more whites will and are showing up in crime stats because as we are overwhelmed with the cultures and behaviors of blacks and non-white immigrants our white youths have more and more negative role models to corrupt them.  I am sorry to predict that soon, white youth crime stats may equal those of the worst minorities.  I hope I&rsquo;m wrong, but watching the local news herein the Northwest lately makes me think I&rsquo;m right.</p>

		<p>Of course profiling is necessary and always will be.  The police profile LEGALLY.  If I, as an older white woman, drive down into some urban ghetto and cruise slowly around, constantly persuing the area, a cop will think I&rsquo;m looking for a drug buy and stop me.  Now, if the cops had to be burdened with stopping everyone, black or white, who drove into the ghetto  &mdash;  even searching of scanning their vehicles with machines  &mdash;  they might not have time to look for suspicious behavior.  And if the searches or scans were done by low-IQ, ill-trained laymen instead, the lack of results would be much worse.  Obviously, this is what is happening at airports, since numbers of people have gotten through who are directly linked with terrorist groups.  </p>

		<p>Avoid the approach of young black men you do not know unless they are working, or obviously dressed for work or church. Cross the street. Change direction. Go back inside and lock the door. It is better to hurt their feelings if they are innocent, than it is to be hurt by them if they are not. </p>

		<p>If a police officer driving through a white suburban neighborhood during a week day when the kids are in school, and the parents are working, sees a young black man in an old car slowly driving around, the young black man may be looking for the home of a boss, a co-worker, or a friend he has decided to visit. He may even live there. He is more likely looking for a house to break into. <br>
 <br>
I want the officer to stop him, look at his driver&rsquo;s license, record the information, and ask what he is doing in the area. If he has legitimate reasons to be in the area he has nothing to worry about. If he is about to commit a crime, he will almost certainly not do so, and he will stay out of the area in the future. <br>
 <br>
As much as possible the police should stop crimes before they happen. This requires a vigorous policy of race profiling.  </p>

		<p>Profiling in the US is &#8220;challenged&#8221; in its need to attain<br>
scientific soundness by its love affair with whole hog environmentalism and its disdain for the sorts of emphases that<br>
characterized the work of the late and great Hans Eysenck, who<br>
gave due regard to the biological bases of human differences.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re white and you live in a neighborhood that is &#8220;diversifying,&#8221; you can count on the cops pulling you over on a regular basis in your own neighborhood.  They will leave you alone once you present your license and they see you live there.</p>
<p>Some of these elderly white people toiling about in black areas?  I lay you odds that those are police bait to catch young blacks in the act of assaulting them.</p>

<p>You live in the northwest the last White majority section of the country.  Most everyone is White so naturally the criminals are White.  Nationally and in states where there are significant numbers of blacks and browns there are few White criminals.</p>
<p>I was a probation officer all my working life. The county was only 8 percent black.  Yet virtually all the criminals were black. </p>
<p>White teenage boys may be influenced by the black life style for a while.  But once they get out of high school where they associate with blacks the influence dies.</p>
<p>When White young men get into the workplace with blacks, they, like everyone of every race, are apalled by the filthy language, sloth, lateness, refusal to do any work, politicking, intriguing and talking about  their dreadful disfunctional private lives to their co- workers.</p>
<p>AS for White men who do commit crimes, a few days in juvenile or adult jail is enough to bring them to race reality.</p>
<p>Believe me, the most anti black Whites are White men who have been in prison or even in city jail with them. In prisons and jails, the hispanics always side with the Whites in self defense.</p>

<p>Because of the hispanic invasion and the high hispanic crime rate, the percentage of Whites in jail and prison is falling fast.  Some state prison systems are something like 50 percent black, 40 percent hispanic and 10 percent White.</p>
<p>Google around for the stats.  I&rsquo;m sure that even in Utah, Idaho and Nevada the percentage of Whites is much lower than the percentage of Whites in the population.  In the northwest states there are also a higher percentage of american indians in the prison population than Whites.</p>

<p>If you are a White man in those neighborhoods they profile you as looking for drugs and hookers.  If you are a White woman they profile you as looking for drugs.</p>
<p>There is no civil rights foundation for Whites to protest this<br>
profiling and discriminatory police stop &amp; question procedure.</p>

		<p>The Filipinos of Redondo Beach CA have a good system.  Many other Asian,,Persian Armenian, Russian communities have the same system.</p>
<p>There is always a retired or night shift person living in those households. So they keep watch for blacks in cars or on foot.</p>
<p>They get the car license.  They call the police right away and report they blacks are harassing women and children, messing with car locks, messing with locked gates, driving erratically whatever.</p>
<p>The police find and stop the blacks.  If there are warrants, even parking and traffic tickets out they are arrested.  If not they are let go.  Either way, it keeps the towns and neighborhoods safe.</p>
<p>If there is a 911 call on record, the blacks cannot claim they have been profiled.</p>

		<p>When I was a teenager in the 80s, I tried to make friends with black teenagers. I was influenced by the media with the various TV shows I grew up with (Good Times, Cosby show, etc). Some of the black people I made friends with were actually decent, but many were loud, out-of-control, and sometimes criminal. I knew criminal whites as well, but not as many. My conclusion was that you can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover&hellip;but generally speaking, it&rsquo;s extremely dangerous to be around large numbers of blacks. </p>
