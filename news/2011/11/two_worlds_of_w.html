<h1>Two Worlds of Whites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ronald Brownstein, National Journal, November 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the day after Barack Obama&rsquo;s sweeping victory in 2008, veteran Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg described the modern Democratic coalition as diverse America and the whites who are comfortable with diverse America.</p>
<p>That appears to be even more true today. The line between whites who are comfortable with the racial and ethnic change transforming America into a &#8220;world nation&#8221; and those uneasy about it increasingly looks like one of the most important boundaries of the 2012 campaign.</p>
<p>The big Pew Center for the People and the Press generational survey released last week offers powerful evidence on that point.  Overall, in the Pew survey, 47 percent of non-Hispanic whites agreed with the statement that &#8220;the growing number of newcomers from other countries are a threat to traditional American customs and values.&#8221; Exactly 50 percent of whites disagreed.</p>
<p>Like an Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor survey released earlier this summer, Pew found that whites comfortable with the demographic changes now underway express very different attitudes than those uneasy about it on President Obama, the role of government, and the choices in the 2012 election.</p>
<p>Among the whites who find the increasing number of newcomers troubling, Obama&rsquo;s approval rating in the new Pew survey stood at just 21 percent with 70 percent disapproving. The president runs much more strongly among whites comfortable with the changes: 45 percent of them approved, while 47 percent disapproved.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m alarmed that fifty percent of whites aren&rsquo;t alarmed by what&rsquo;s happening to their own country. I am firmly convinced that it&rsquo;s liberal whites who are responsble for all the lunacy of the last forty years, if whites voted their interests as a &#8216;bloc&rsquo; the way 90-plus percent of blacks do, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this dereadful mess. </p>

<p>Translation into English: &#8220;The line between media-brainwashed liberal Whites and those still able to think for themselves means the Obongo regime has not yet achieved its goal of total power.&#8221;</p>
<p>I swear these little press releases are all designed by committee.  Just look at all the weasel wording in this single rambling sentence:</p>
<p>1: &#8220;&hellip;the racial and ethnic change transforming America&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>As if this &#8220;transformation&#8221; is some kind of natural process, like sunspots or tides, that human effort cannot affect.  And what Ron <b>Brownstein</b> calls a &#8220;transformation&#8221; looks pretty much to us peons here at ground level like a &#8220;disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>2: &#8220;&hellip;a World nation&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And what exactly <i>is</i> a &#8220;world nation?&#8221;  You can have a world <i>or</i> you can have a nation, but the two are mutually exclusive.  Liberal newspeak is nothing if not shameless.</p>
<p>3: &#8220;&hellip;those uneasy about it&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>In plain words, those Racist, Hateful, Nazi White Supremacists who still haven&rsquo;t learned to love Big Brown Brother.  Such throwbacks will be cleansed just as soon as Obongo&rsquo;s community organizing can spin its unopposed web across the land.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the &#8220;National Journal&#8221; is.  But judging from this sample, it&rsquo;s yet another self-adoring elitist rag from the leftmost fringes of cultural marxism.  Let them stare into the mirror, preening and polishing their precious Tolerance all they like.  The rest of us have work to do.<br>

		<p>What these stupid Whites don&rsquo;t seem to understand is that this is natural selection in progress. Whites who have a strong ethnic and racial identity are less likely to miscegenate or to be subjected to foreign rule than Whites who basically don&rsquo;t see themselves as White or don&rsquo;t see it as mattering. In the end, the only thing that matters is who&rsquo;s still around. Will Europeans disappear? It certainly looks like it, unfortunately. You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have the innate instinct to survive, but the media changed all that.</p>

		<p>The report itself was dripping with left-leaning bias.  I wouldn&rsquo;t put much stock in it.  For example, it said of the whites that see immigration as a threat, 21% of them supported Obama.  That makes absolutely no sense.  They see immigration as a threat, a bad thing, yet they support the president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in any kind of effective way and that sues any state that tries to fill the gap left by federal negligence?  I don&rsquo;t think so. This poll reeks big time. Leftist fluff to make it look like the Democrats and Obama have more support than they really have. I guess we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>So what if &#8220;whites&#8221; as a group become something different in America? Those who call themselves &#8220;whites&#8221; today are, in fact, a mongrel mix of varied peoples from all over Europe, the ancestors of whom once considered themselves distinct races. Whiteness as it exists in the modern US is a social idea and the truth is that a significant percentage of people who imagine themselves to be &#8220;pure white&#8221; have ancestors within the last 200 years who were black and/or Native American. It really is sad to see so many (though, on the whole a tiny number) of people coming on this site to circle the racial wagons and bemoan the supposed passing of the white race. For a people who claim to have given the world so much, the people here are rather a defeatist lot who don&rsquo;t seem to think they&rsquo;re up to the task of competing where their ancestors thrived. </p>

		<p>The statement that &ldquo;the growing number of newcomers from other countries are a threat to traditional American customs and values.&rdquo; is one many whites would have trouble affirming. </p>
<p>The falsehood that America is a &#8220;nation of immigrants&#8221; is considered truth by many, and not only hardcore liberals. It is assumed thus that it is a &#8220;traditional American value&#8221;. In areas like New Jersey, for instance, many whites would have difficulty detailing any traditional American customs, though there are still many obvious ones still to point to. </p>
<p>Arguing against immigration, they feel, would be to argue that they and their ancestors do not have a legitimate place in America. It is a difficult thing to wrestle with, especially as many Americans identify closely with the foreign, European ethnicity of their ancestors. </p>
<p>This is a comforting protection. It isn&rsquo;t uncommon to hear someone argue, for instance that he or she owes blacks nothing- no apologies, or reparations, or charity- on the basis of his or her ancestors lived nowhere near America and thus no connection to the slave trade or Jim Crow. I do believe the concept of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; was established foremost to drive white-guilt into these folks. </p>
<p>The all-encompassing term &#8220;newcomers&#8221; would also make the statement difficult for many to affirm. A man might deny the statement, for instance, simply on the basis of having a close friend born in Poland. The same man might at the same time call for all the Muslims in America to be thrown into the ocean, or wish for all the Mexicans and Hindus to be fired from work and sent packing. </p>
<p>As with the non-white immigrants, many whites of recent immigrant background would love to have more of their specific ethnic brethren around.  It is, indeed, the strength- not the lack- of racial and ethnic identity that makes them unable to agree to the statement posed. </p>
<p>Sadly that ethnic identity isn&rsquo;t as &#8220;Americans&#8221;. Until that becomes our ethnic consciousness, too many will continue to view America as a mold-able void rather than their beloved homeland. </p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t fall into the despair of assuming the 50% are all devout libtards. </p>

		<p>Of course.  White people are just evil raaaciss.  The actual percentage of backward racist whites who believe immigration is a problem is probably around 80 or 90%.  They are just hiding their racism.  But not to worry, we&rsquo;ll get to their children while they&rsquo;re young.  Heck, we can get the children to report on their evil behavior.  We can make saying what they think so costly that they&rsquo;ll keep their racism to themselves. </p>
<p>/sarc off.</p>
<p>I hope the percentage of people who distrust the demographic changes posed by immigration is higher than this poll indicates.  I don&rsquo;t trust polls.  They are too easy to skew.  I believe some poll showed 80% of Americans want the southern border to be controlled.  I&rsquo;m aware it isn&rsquo;t quite the same issue, but it gives me a little hope.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t reconcile this article with the hard reality of demographic statistics.  Most of the blue states except for the mid-Atlantic region and California have White demographics higher than the national average.  Wisonsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Vermont, Maine, Washington, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and several other places have strong White majorities.  I don&rsquo;t these people really wanted Obama, they wanted Clinton and the only reason people voted for him was because they were afraid of destroying the fragile coalition that holds them together.  I suspect alot of GOP voters switched to Democrat before the primaries to throw Clinton out of the race by voting for Obama.  At first, blacks didn&rsquo;t warm up to Obama because they didn&rsquo;t think he had a chance of winning but when they saw him rising they dumped Clinton like a sack of garbage on the curb.</p>

		<p>Brazil has apparently been on the up-and-up economically for about 15 years now, but what they don&rsquo;t tell you is that it is White-founded countries and White ancestral homelands through the IMF, domestic government aid and national fund-raising efforts by White nations themselves who it is that fiscally, educationally and technologically supply the materials and know-how by which such so-called &#8216;developing&rsquo; countries as the likes of Brazil are able to function even at a basic level, at all.</p>
<p>Brazil&rsquo;s multi-racial and heavily race-mixed population <b>is</b> still exhibiting racism to this day only, they&rsquo;re directing it at medium to lighter skinned coloureds instead.</p>
<p>So much for the Marxist utopian notion that it&rsquo;s possible to eliminate what is a naturally-occurring human trait, ie, the desire to belong to a homogeneous nation comprised of one&rsquo;s own kind rather than a mish-mash of black/brown/white mongrelized citizenry with confused and fractured identities pertaining to one another&rsquo;s biological roots and cultures, masquerading as a nation. </p>

		<p>This is why this country will never be fixed again for us racially aware Whites. The &#8220;reform&#8221; immigration guy, Lewis, won in AZ over the hardcore immigration stance of Pearce. Most Mormons and the Mexicans, legal and illegal, voted for Lewis and to top that off they had an &#8220;open primary&#8221; where Democrats could vote in the Republican primary!  What a complete fraud and we are doomed if we have to depend on the votes of the sheeple and mexicans. All elections are becoming anti-White. Voting will never turn this country around ever again.</p>

<p>Agree. I think until a majority of Whites really start feeling the pain of diversity treatments little will change. I have NO doubt that Whites will begin acting as a collective racial group. The only question is how many more diversity treatments will it take. I also do not believe the work of Jared and others has been in vain. Far from it. It took decades of intense mind control techniques from the uber Libs and their minority pawns to get us where we&rsquo;re at today. It will take time and pain for the majority of Whites to wake up.</p>
<p>Until then we have voices in the wilderness like Jared&rsquo;s providing information for the masses.<br>

<p>Do you know the difference between ethnicity and race? A person who is half German and half English is not a mongrel. That person is still White. You are splitting hairs. If you go back far enough then we all had common ancestors but that isn&rsquo;t where we&rsquo;re at today. Deal with it.</p>
<p>As far as being defeatist, all we have right now is just a handful of people with the foresight to see what is going on against the entire establishment media. Things WILL change. Its going to take more diversity treatments.</p>

<p>By Peter Slevin<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer <br>
Monday, July 26, 2010 </p>
<p>In a bid to remake the enforcement of federal immigration laws, the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants and auditing hundreds of businesses that blithely hire undocumented workers. <br>

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency expects to deport about 400,000 people this fiscal year, nearly 10 percent above the Bush administration&rsquo;s 2008 total and 25 percent more than were deported in 2007. The pace of company audits has roughly quadrupled since President George W. Bush&rsquo;s final year in office.<br>

		<p>RTB describes the white population of the USA as &#8220;mongrels&#8221;. This term would be &#8220;offensive&#8221; if applied to non-whites, and it is also rubbish in terms of biological anthropology.<br>
Culturally the whites of different national origin now have English as their common language, and the Constitution as the basis of their political system, and the territory between Canada and Mexico as their common homeland.<br>
Most whites and some non-whites don&rsquo;t want this changed for the worse.<br>
QED.</p>
<p>What to do? How turn the present majority largely unspoken sentiment into a political force in the papers and at the polls? A multi-varied resistance at all levels of society, by different non-violent methods, and a simplification of the rational and moral arguments (e.g. Jared Taylor&rsquo;s) for white preservation for the &#8220;masses&#8221; - remembering Gustave LeBon&rsquo;s observation, &#8220;Crowds always, and individuals as a rule, stand in need of ready made opinions&hellip; The popularity of these opinions is independent of the measure of truth or error they contain, and is solely regulated by their prestige.&#8221;<br>
The prestige of the financial-liberal nomenklatura is beginning to shake, and our biggest concern should be that a neo-marxist revolutionary street army will arise instead of a decent white nationalist movement. The paradox is that this might rescue the cosmopolitan capitalists and save the day for white suicide. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The big Pew Center for the People and the Press generational survey released last week offers powerful evidence on that point. Overall, in the Pew survey, 47 percent of non-Hispanic whites agreed with the statement that &ldquo;the growing number of newcomers from other countries are a threat to traditional American customs and values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do Hispanic Whites think? If anyone is familiar with the customs and values of &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; non-Whites and knows what they will do to a country when present in large numbers it should be us. </p>

<p>And You believe this? While our borders are wide open they are &#8220;deporting&#8221; illegals? Why? So they can just come right back in? </p>
<p>The things you post here and your whole thought processes should embarrass, even yourself. </p>
<p>Come on, John, even YOU don&rsquo;t expect us to buy into that Obama lie, do you? You must take us all for chumps. </p>

<p>Says it all. A black friend&hellip;no wonder you are thought to be a troll. I have to agree with those here who say you are a troll and are anti-White from all the stuff you post and link. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>Guess you learned nothing from being mugged by 2 black men. Your response would surely be that, &#8220;hey, Whites still commit more crimes than blacks do&#8221;&hellip;.right?</p>

		<p>In John&rsquo;s defense, look who the GOP ran for president in 2008.  John &#8220;Amnesty&#8221; McCain who co-wrote a &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform bill&#8221; with Teddy Kennedy that was pushed for by the Bush administration.  Both men promised to push it through once they got office.  Obama has yet to really do it, but keeps dangling it like a carrot to get Mestizos to vote for him. </p>
<p>Is there any doubt that the first act, aside from bombing Iran, a President McCain would do is pass amnesty?  </p>
<p>On amnestying Mestizos, I trust Obama infinitely more than I trust any GOP candidate.  He&rsquo;s a black nationalist who is aware that his race is getting its rump handed to them by invading Mestizos.  He&rsquo;ll promise the Mestizos the moon, make a big production about easing up on enforcing immigration, and then clamp back down on the as soon as he gets another term.  </p>
<p>Unless Ron Paul, against all odds, takes the GOP nomination, Whites are in the position of another &#8220;pick your poison&#8221; presidential race.  The only GOP candidate left standing will be the least palatable or beneficial to Whites.  And it will be a choice between him or Obama.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I do not believe Obama will embroil us into a war with Iran and pull us out of Iraq and Afghanistan.  I believe he will put teeth to immigration laws to keep the Mestizos from stealing any more welfare and affirmative action benefits from his black buddies.</p>
<p>His disastrous job-destroying economic policies will force welfare benefits to be reserved for American nationals and not only dissuade Mestizos from entering the USA, but encourage many of them to return to their countries of national origin. </p>
<p>Obama makes no distinctions between rich Whites and poor Whites when it comes to forcing Section 8 housing down White gullets.  The only hope of Whites coming to the right consensus about racial realism is if the liberals in Westchester get to savor the richness of diversity as much as working class Whites do.  </p>
<p>So, to me, a Black Nationalist Crypto-Muslim who openly hates White people is the lesser of the two evils than any White Race Traitor who is so owned by AIPAC that he will embroil us into one disastrous war after another in the Middle East while leaving our borders wide open to illegal unassimiliable Mestizo aliens in the interests of ever cheaper labor.  </p>
<p>I, for one, am tired of the incremental poisoning presented by the warmongering, open borders Neo Con Republicans.  Obama is a nasty, nauseating emetic, but in my opinion, that&rsquo;s exactly what White America needs in order to be purged of decades of Anti-White brainwashing.  </p>

<p>The main factual flaw in your thinking is that Obama has already enacted as much formal immigration amnesty has he can through executive order.  Vdare calls it &#8220;administrative amnesty,&#8221; basically it&rsquo;s a fancy phrase for refusing to enforce the law and therefore making the law a dead letter.</p>
<p>From a tactical standpoint, I don&rsquo;t think Obama really cares that much about black voters in terms of greasing their palms.  We all know he&rsquo;ll get almost 100% of the black vote every time he runs, no matter what he does to them or for them.</p>
