<h1>Role of Race in School Fights Downplayed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Travis Fain, Winston-Salem Journal, November 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>School and police officials said this week that last month&rsquo;s fights at Parkland High School weren&rsquo;t racially motivated, but warrants in the case repeatedly mention race, describing two small groups of black and Hispanic students facing off.</p>
<p>One warrant, filed by Parkland School Resource Officer Kraig Sandell, describes a &#8220;Hispanic group confronting the African-American group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another arrest warrant accuses a Hispanic student of &#8220;provoking African-American students to engage in a physical confrontation,&#8221; and another says a Hispanic student was &#8220;attempting to engage in a physical altercation with African-American students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other warrants accuse at least two black students of &#8220;provoking Hispanic students to react with violence&#8221; or &#8220;attempting to fight and provoke Hispanic students in the hallway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter is an accusation against Wayne Anthony Cameron Jr., who was charged with affray, a misdemeanor, after the Oct. 27 fights that brought dozens of officers to the school.</p>
<p>Cameron, 17, told the Journal that his fight started when he bumped into a group of Hispanic students in the hall.</p>
<p>Cameron said the student told him they were going to &#8220;whoop y&rsquo;alls&rsquo; black a  &mdash;  .&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m black, I guess,&#8221; Cameron said.</p>
<p>When Sandell and Principal Tim Lee laid out the details of the fights Monday during a two-hour meeting with parents, they acknowledged that the fights were between black and Hispanic groups, but said race wasn&rsquo;t a motivating factor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sandell said his brief descriptions in the warrants were meant to describe the situation, not to relay any sense that race sparked the fights.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&rsquo;t explain everything in just a couple of sentences,&#8221; Sandell said. &#8220;That&rsquo;s how (the students) divided up &hellip; that&rsquo;s their friends.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were also rumors that someone would shoot up the school in the week after the fight, something the school and police took seriously and brought in extra officers to investigate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Parkland&rsquo;s student body is about 50 percent black and 28 percent Hispanic.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They said that the groups were African-American and Hispanic, but they didn&rsquo;t believe the fight was racially motivated,&#8221; Martin said in an email. &#8220;They were there and did not hear any racial slurs being shouted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics are fighting solely along racial lines and race isn&rsquo;t a factor?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just short of amazing how these administrators and police nearly always play down the racial angle in these many black/Hispanic riots and melees.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how these politically correct liars try to paint the picture the entire racial situation will continue to get worse all across the country. </p>
<p>Most all races do not want to integrate with one another and prefer grouping with their own kind.  </p>
<p>Without blacks there wouldn&rsquo;t be as much turmoil, but people still would split along lines of race.  But, with blacks, it&rsquo;s impossible to avoid fights and chaos, because they fight with every group.  When they can&rsquo;t fight with other races, they fight among themselves.</p>

		<p>There is a lot of tension between blacks and Mexicans in Denver. In the cases of which I am aware, the blacks caused the fights and continually provoked the Mexicans until they fought back. The blacks seemed to think that they were unbeatable but the Mexican kids seem to have a lot more ability to absorb punishment undiminished and keep going back hard. </p>
<p>There was one case in which a black staff member of a middle school called a meeting with Spanish speaking staff members. She said that blacks and Mexicans had a lot in common, eating beans, and such. I kid you not. She went through a whole series of things that the two groups supposedly had in common but she ommitted the fact that both groups had a traidition of horrendolusly and obscenely insulting the mothers of their object of ire. They had that in common, too. When you do that the other guy might forget that you eat some of the same foods! </p>
<p>In my experience the black students are immensely aggressive, insulting, and violent with each other, Mexican students, white students, and even very frequently TOWARD WHITE STAFF MEMBERS! Nothing is out of bounds with a huge percentage of the black students. The administrators let them get away with murder! They fear losing funding due to losing students that they suspend or expel. They also fear the label &#8220;racist.&#8221; They fear these things so much that they will allow criminal behavior and endanger staff members in their school rather than discipline these students appropriately.</p>
<p>The black students spend hundreds of hours a year obsessively dwelling (with their misguided &#8220;teachers&#8221;) on all of the wrongs that their entire race has suffered and they are tremendously, murderously angry. Consider that the most radical 60s terrorists are spewing anti-white venom at these kids for many thousands of hours of their lives. For all intents and purposes radicals do control the curriculum and what they teach is exagerated and very ugly. These so-called educators are inciting violence.</p>

		<p>Race would only be a factor for police, schools and the media if white kids were involved.  And by involved I mean if white kids were targeted.  It&rsquo;s very rare for white kids to start the fights.  Unfortunately, most white kids do not defend themselves.  No doubt there would be hell to pay if they did.</p>

<p>Oh, because the blacks and hispanics group according to race, that means the fights  weren&rsquo;t racial.</p>
<p>The real reason why altercations involving whites (usually much smaller than those described here) are called &#8220;race-based&#8221; is that the authorities know whites will be shamed by such accusations, while other races will not be.</p>

		<p>Worth IL. they have Stagg HS and the student body has the influx of Arab and Mexican students, those groups forming gangs, hating one another and fighting it out with the whitey kids in between.</p>
<p>And of course education is now secondary to diversity with all the positives it brings [wrong]!</p>

		<p>I wonder how long before &#8220;brown racism&#8221; becomes the new mantra for the NAACP and other black racist groups to continue the self-imposed &#8220;victim&#8221; status of blacks. Seems that in that school which is 78% non-White, where clearly Whites in the minority, that &#8220;racism&#8221; has been curbed to a minimum&hellip;right? No Whitey, no racism right? How long will it take blacks to shift their blame-game to the brown side? I suppose it is just a matter of time, as the White  population is pushed to the minority status and the brown population swells to fill the void. After a few more schools start to become more brown than black, we will see the shift in who is deemed &#8220;the bad guy&#8221; for blacks from White to brown. </p>

		<p>I think there&rsquo;s a definite amount of sophistry in play here. Purely racial fights are pretty rare. It happens - maybe Mexicans beat up blacks coming to school on Cinco de Mayo, maybe some blacks go flashmobbing to beat up some whiteys. Typically, though, it&rsquo;s just a case of racial angle making everything ten times worse. I&rsquo;m guessing this was a case where some black gave some perceived disrespect for the Hispanic, who then started a fight, or the other way around. This then lured in most blacks and Hispanics in the vicinity to side with their coracialists, and whoever the scuffle then promptly revenged it on the other race, triggering a whole sequence of small-scale retaliations from both sides.</p>
<p>Not racial. Nuh-huh. It was about perceived disrespect, a foolish boy trying to pick a fight, and revenge. Never mind that without race the initial argument might not have even escalated into a fight, and it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have sucked in much of the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandell said his brief descriptions in the warrants were meant to describe the situation, not to relay any sense that race sparked the fights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t explain everything in just a couple of sentences,&rdquo; Sandell said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how (the students) divided up &hellip; that&rsquo;s their friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>And how come blacks in your school are apparently friends with just blacks, and Hispanics only with Hispanics?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a clue of what to do with the racial solidarities of blacks and Hispanics, and the mutual hostility between those two. So, they&rsquo;re afraid to admit it to anyone, even to themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prinicpal also told parents that he has worked in schools with a race problem, and they have a different feel than Parkland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t feel a sense of racial tension in the hallways here,&#8221; Lee said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if Lee is right, what are the chances of this being true a year or two from now? It&rsquo;s amazing how incidents like that can poison the relationships between groups already mistrustful of each other.</p>

		<p>I attended a predominantly African American school in Northern California, and the Blacks were always harassing Asians and, to a lesser extent, Whites. </p>
<p>If you were Asian, you were pretty much subject to Black tyranny everyday outside of class (mainly because there aren&rsquo;t too many Blacks in AP Math &amp; Physics classes).<br>
 <br>
One group Blacks were always cautious to get into altercations with in school were always the Mexicans. </p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t aspire to emulate them, they certainly seemed to be immune to the Afro-Tyranny that many Asians and Whites were subject to in High School.</p>
<p>Why? It&rsquo;s simple Mexicans will confront the black hordes and fight back.</p>
<p>Blacks only pick on Asians and Whites because they know that we won&rsquo;t do anything to them.<br>

		<p>This is simply a reflection of a much bigger problem whose roots have not been exposed. Here in Los Angeles, the areas of South L.A., South-Central L.A. and Watts were at one time (i.e., the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s) all-Black neighborhoods. The second half of the 1980s and first half of the &rsquo;90s saw a truly steady and consistent influx of Mexican and Central American immigrants coming into these areas  &mdash;  primarily because the cost of apartment rentals in these areas were quite cheap in comparison to other parts of L.A.. To make a long story short, the Hispanic population in many of these areas has superseded the Black population and this has caused problems of its own. For one, many Blacks feel that the Hispanics have literally &#8220;invaded&#8221; their neighborhoods and they deeply resent the fact that this has created a cut-throat competittion as far as unskilled labor and unskilled jobs are concerned. Further compounding the problem is the fact that illegal aliens are willing to do these menial jobs at lower rates than Blacks and that they can be paid &#8220;under the table&#8221;. Another issue is that many of these Mexican and Central American immigrants have NO interest whatsoever in learning English and/or at least trying to assimilate into North American society and this has greatly increased the need for bilingual education programs in LAUSD schools. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that many of these immigrants (particularly recent arrivals) do not understand the severity and complexity of the Black experience here in the U.S. and that many of them do not trust anyone who is not of their own kind. Although you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to find a Black or a Hispanic to admit it publicly, the truth is that some Blacks and Hispanics can be extremely racist toward each other  &mdash;  in more ways than one.</p>

		<p>Hispanics are racially cohesive and often have gangs to back them up. Blacks tend to be disrespectful and aggressive and have difficulty getting along with each other much less another ethnic group. As a result these incidents are only going to become more frequent and intense.</p>

No, it will only happen when and IF Hispanics come to represent economic strength/power.  Whites will be blamed until they no longer represent the owner of wealth/power.</p>

		<p>Wow, great comments, thanks everyone! This is the big one coming down the pike  &mdash;  we see it already in LA, and Denver, and soon we&rsquo;ll see it in Alabama  &mdash;  Mexicans standing up to blacks. Trouble is, you become who you compete with, and those second-generation-Mexicans are becoming very much like blacks: bling, gang signs, drugs, and government assistance (yes, I&rsquo;m talking about WIC, SNAP, TNAF, Section 8, and all-night basketball). They are even talking like the blacks. I mean look at what &#8220;Cameron&#8221; said the Mexican told him: &ldquo;whoop y&rsquo;alls&rsquo; black a &mdash; .&rdquo; </p>

		<p>My son graduated from this high school recently, and his friends who are still there tell us that the fight started between two gang groups, one black and one hispanic. The kids were openly wearing gang colors and screaming gang names at each other during the fight. Or rather, fights, as it was more than one group in more than one hallway. If it wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;racial&#8221; and it wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;gangs&#8221; then why the need for close to 50 LEO&rsquo;s, and a campus lockdown to stop the violence? Since my son started, the principal(black) and the assistant principals(also black) have been denying the gang problem there, and endangering the rest of the student body. I made arrangements for my son to attend the college prep program off campus just to get him out of there. And the media reports nothing. Of course, we&rsquo;re a &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; city, so no negative reports can be made about our huge illegals problem either. </p>
