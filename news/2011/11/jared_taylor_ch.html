<h1><a href="http://home.uvawise.edu/highlandcavalier/?p=4925">Jared Taylor Challenges Campus to Debate Diversity</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, The Highland Cavalier, November 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Oct. 28, &#8220;The Highland Cavalier&#8221; published an editorial claiming that the positions held by my organization, the New Century Foundation, are &#8220;ignorant&#8221; because we find racial diversity to be a weakness for the United States and not a strength. I suspect that many on the UVa-Wise campus share the Cavalier&rsquo;s indignation that anyone could question current orthodoxies. After all, from the President of the United States on down, we always hear that diversity is our strength  &mdash;  perhaps even America&rsquo;s greatest strength.</p>
<p>And yet, as of Nov. 3, there were 30 online comments to your editorial, and virtually all agreed with us rather than you. Clearly, there is a substantial point of view that is seldom heard on campus, and I believe UVa-Wise would benefit from further discussion. I propose a public debate between myself and any faculty member on the following question: &#8220;Is diversity a strength for America?&#8221;</p>
<p>The affirmative position is so widely proclaimed that surely someone on campus will defend it. If my opinions are as &#8220;ignorant&#8221; as your editorial claims, they should be easy to refute. I look forward to a lively exchange. If none is forthcoming  &mdash;  if no one steps forward to defend orthodoxy  &mdash;  some may conclude that those who profess to love diversity have no stomach for the diversity that matters most: a diversity of opinions.</p>
<p><em>Taylor is president of the New Century Foundation in Oakton, Va.</em></p>

		<p>I do so love how &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; is one of their most devastating (to them) insults or accusations. It&rsquo;s a cover-all, ready made silly tactic and is what passes for a legitimate observation in some circles. </p>
<p>Very easy to blindly and automatically call someone ignorant. Their &#8216;ignance&rsquo; is bliss.</p>

		<p>Always properly frame the terms of the debate so it becomes a &#8220;debate&#8221;. The &#8220;debate&#8221; about the blessings of diversity must be framed completely in terms of Native Born White American racial interests. From the get go, state that &#8220;diversity&#8221; means forcing on millions of Native Born White Americans an immigration policy that will rapidly reduce the Native Born White American Majority to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America where they will be surrounded by a heavily armed,hostile and high fertility post-1965 nonwhite majority. And then ask the following question:  Why should the Native Born White American Majority be in favor of this? Obviously, there is no reason why the Native Born White American Majority should be in favor of this&hellip;and therefore, the diversity enthusiasts should not be the least bit shocked that there is increasing White resistance to increasing diversity-a policy of race-replacement through post-1965 immigration policy.</p>
<p>Also point out that  the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diversity-post-1965 immigration policy-is also a policy of hyper-exponential population growth that will sooner than you think cause the ecological collapse of the US. Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of this? Point out that the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diversity enthusiasts are well aware of the fact that the Native Born White American Majority has had a ZPG fertility level since 1973..and that they are taking advantage of this fact by promoting an immigration policy that massively accelerates White race-replacement..in effect, the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diversity enthusiasts are knowingly waging a vicious race war of race-replacement against the Native Born White American Majority.</p>
<p>Jared Taylor</p>
<p>From here on in, you must be in a street fighters mindset in your public debates. The issue is not complicated..tell it like it is.</p>

		<p>I just posted this to the original article. It&rsquo;s awaiting moderation:</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>LMAO! Wise kiddies [the school is in Wise, Va.], EVERY SINGLE ONE of your professors will pretend to support diversity as a strength, and EVERY SINGLE ONE of them will demur when offered the opportunity to show just how ignorant Mr. Taylor is, and how ignorant the almost 30 online commenters who supported him are! </p>
<p>Your frightened professors will tell you that such dismal ignorance requires no rebuttal! Your frightened professors will tell you that they don&rsquo;t wish to lend legitimacy to such vile and ignorant views by debating them. Your frightened professors will tell you everything except the truth: THEY ARE FRIGHTENED! </p>
<p>Not only frightened that they will be made to look like fools by the unbeatable combination of the truth and its able expositor Mr. Taylor, but frightened that in some cases their own carefully hidden understanding that diversity is a weakness might be exposed and cost them their community standing and maybe even their jobs. The terror of job loss and financial ruin is what has silenced truth about race in this country and has enabled anti-Whites to continue their steady program toward White Genocide.</p>
<p>The people who have told you the lies you now believe and who have compelled others to tell you those same lies say that they are anti-racists, but what they are is anti-White. Anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White!</p>
<p>Wake up, and understand that by imitating the beliefs of anti-Whites you are supporting White Genocide!</p>

		<p>I feel it necessary to remind Mr Taylor that should UVa-Wise accept this offer, a large security presence must accompany it.  As we&rsquo;ve seen in the past, those that despise Mr Taylor&rsquo;s viewpoint will be out in force to squash this debate and they will go to extreme measures to prevent others from hearing it.  From carrying banners into the facility and blocking the podium to chanting and shouting down Mr Taylor to even storming the stage and physically removing him.  Security must be considered at any campus debate involving Mr Taylor.  The anti-Whites just won&rsquo;t sit idly by and allow their &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; othodoxy to be exposed for the fraud that it is.</p>

<p>If they do accept your offer it would be great if the debate could  be recorded and posted on youtube (or other) for our viewing pleasure.

<p>Especially for students in Appalachia, don&rsquo;t you think &#8220;White Genocide&#8221; might seem a bit extreme? The other points you make in your post are very good IMO, but I&rsquo;m concerned that the charge of &#8220;White Genocide&#8221; might totally cancel out any acceptance your other points might find.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White!&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe the term anti-racist is much used by anyone, and I especially don&rsquo;t think the students you&rsquo;re addressing will have heard it.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be clearer to simply say that racist has become a code word for white?</p>
<p>I ask these questions respectfully since I like the other points in your post. I do hope that there will be at least one professor as haplessly brainwashed as the students he himself has brainwashed, who will believe that anyone with Jared Taylor&rsquo;s views must certainly be ignorant and easily defeated in debate, and that he will see Jared&rsquo;s offer as an opportunity to increase his own anti-racist stature on campus! Oh, may the god of entertainment let it be so! </p>

		<p>Mr Taylor, you can expect these folks who KNOW they are right and superior to you to decline your invitation. Most likely after investigating and finding out you are not a K member with a shaved head, they will use a typical excuse. Like, we don&rsquo;t invite those who espouse bigotry or use hate speech to come to our campus.  Or some other nonsense.</p>
<p>Regardless, it was genius to throw the ball back into their court. They can now choose to have you mop the floor with them in a debate or look cowardly and inept by declining and refusing to back their stance. Either way, you will come out on top. As usual. </p>

		<p>If I might make a suggestion.  Base your debate around the term &#8220;ignorance&#8221;, what it means and then debate who is really ignorant.</p>
<p>The term ignorant implies something is being ignored.  That the person is not stupid.  Not uneducated.  And is very much aware of the facts&hellip;.yet is stubbornly devoted to an opinion that ignores these facts.  This person has challenged you and claims their are facts you are ignoring.  Make him spell out what those facts are and challenge the truthfulness of what he is saying.</p>
<p>Then spell out important facts that he ignores about the national, social and personal costs of diversity&hellip;..especially the rape, robbery, murder, assault, cannibalism (and yes, what is going on in mexico has made its way over the border), kidnapping, etc. etc. that is now the high risk reality of white americans because diversity if forced upon us.  Those things are true and difficult if not impossible to refute. For example, name one black community that isn&rsquo;t violent, sadistic and predatory towards whites&hellip;anywhere in the world.  What&rsquo;s going on in south africa and zimbabwe deserves mention.</p>
<p>And point out that the person, actually knows these things.  And ignores them.  Most importantly, point out how callous that is.  To ignore a rape victim, or a murder, or assaults.  To go so far as attempt to cover these things up&hellip;..especially with a controlled media.  That makes your opponent worse than ignorant.  It makes them evil&hellip;.a monster.  That&rsquo;s something they should not be allowed to ignore.</p>
<p>One day, whites will become sane enough to physically sanction people like this.  Diversity is not a strength but it will land you in prison because of all the awful things done in its name.  Sadly, we are nowhere near that yet.  Instead, we should shame them.  Because what they do and what they are IS shameful.</p>
<p>That is the point. Debates, in classical good humor and fellowship, are to be won and no hard feelings afterwards.  But this is not the debating society at my old college. These people are bad people and debate is a weapon and a medicine.  To stop them and perhaps heal them.</p>

		<p>Be careful Mr. Taylor.  If the debate does happen, ensure the police/school won&rsquo;t allow you to be shouted down.  As we usually see happen with our viewpoint.</p>
<p>But, I echo the response here.  You are brave to do these things.  I fear professional sanction if I were to discuss it as such.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;diversity&#8221; irony here is that UVa-Wise (the only satellite campus of the University of Virginia) is down in far southwestern Virginia on the Virginia/Kentucky state line&hellip;in a county that&rsquo;s 97% White.  They sing the praises of diversity in probably the least diverse county in the entire Commonwealth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the UVa-Wise administration will have the guts to take Mr. Taylor up on his offer.  Liberal academics are cowards who don&rsquo;t have the courage to debate their convictions.  They just deem them as true because they&rsquo;re smarter than the rest of us (so they think), and expect us to fall in line.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard Mr. Taylor described as a race-relations expert. He&rsquo;s been studying race from a national think-tank for almost 20 years. Mr Taylor may be wrong but I&rsquo;d be surprised if he&rsquo;s as ignorant on racial issues as the staff of the paper who are likely greater experts on how to keep their jobs. Mr Taylor is as educated on race as are most minority activists who also keep an eye on the racial issue. Which is to say, he&rsquo;s as great an expert on race as are most people of color in America.</p>
<p>I disagree with Mr Taylor on one aspect of his letter. The university is not so much against a diversity of opinion. It&rsquo;s against &#8216;diversity&rsquo; in the form of whites. There are no calls for diversity in any organisation, neighborhood, nation, university, job-site or city now where people of color are the majority, or where they have historically been a majority. Well, there are passionate calls for celebrating diversity there, too, by which they mean calls for even more respect and favors for people who look just like them. In any organization with a diversity plan the specific literal definition of diversity means discrimination against whites, and also blaming them for insensitivity and discrimination. </p>
<p>There is no university, of any makeup or history,  that has a white united student group on campus, even as they passionately call for diversity, and attempt to have us believe the embodiment of diversity is to be found in these student groups for persons of color and in their activities. And they are paraded about and speak as the representatives of diversity. Likely their activities are covered by the school paper. Some (insensitive people) suggest their agenda has become part of the curriculum over time. </p>
<p>On each campus in America, with well over dozens of these special interest groups active or affiliated with campus, for persons of color and persons of color only, they call for even more &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. If any single campus truly valued diversity there&rsquo;s one small step they could take. Bring one white student group on campus. It doesn&rsquo;t require intellectually different ideas to have diversity on campus. Unless of course diversity simply means people of color.</p>
<p>A university that valued diversity would demand at least one white interest group on campus to join those already there that serve every other racial group. One is it takes. On any American university, anywhere in the country. Just one. Our demands for &#8216;diversity&rsquo; begin with something small. If any students read this. Remember, one is all we ask for. Remember this next time, likely tomorrow, the university pledges to do all it can with all it&rsquo;s heart and soul and formidable intellect, to do all it can to bring more diversity to campus, all we ask is for one student group on campus. Just one. That should be easy for these experts on tolerance and diversity. </p>
<p>Diversity is just a word, but by observing it&rsquo;s legal definition where it is put into practice it usually just means discrimination against whites, and one might add, by all apperences, excluding them. </p>
<p>Mr Taylor would like to speak on campus bringing with him some intellectual diversity of the kind the university is so proud of. His appearance will not bring the diversity that&rsquo;s truly needed. </p>

		<p>if only 1/10th of the people who held these beliefs had the courage of mr taylor, we could really make things happen. sadly, most of us fear retribution that comes with putting our necks on the line.</p>
<p>but this movement is growing.  most if not all blogs ive come across in the &#8220;manosphere&#8221; provide links to WN websites.  The main foundations behind these blogs, and those associated with &#8220;game&#8221; is that:<br>
 1) we have been lied to our whole lives<br>
3) diversity and PC garbage is instantly dismissed <br>
2) there are concrete biological differences between men and women (which manifest in different behaviour)  &mdash;  &gt;this opens the door to exploring racial differences, which readers then discover do in fact exist.</p>

<p><i>[In regard to the refrain &#8220;anti-racist is a code word for anti-White]&hellip; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be clearer to simply say that racist is a code word for white?</i></p>
<p>Why should we help the anti-Whites hammer home the terminology they hold us trapped in (&#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;racism,&#8221; etc.) by using the same words ourselves??? Instead, we should impose OUR terminology! Our refrain is proving effective, and its meaning immediately clear, when we use it today among mainstream whites.</p>
<p>As I said above, Anti-Whites have hammered the terms &#8220;racist&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; so deeply into White minds that now most Whites automatically respond with those terms to any other White who says anything non-liturgical about race. We should hammer our own terminology so deeply into White minds that when any White says something that is not pro-White, most Whites will immediately think, &#8220;an anti-White who supports White Genocide&#8221;! </p>
<p>Please consider also: Every use of the r-word affirms and deepens that word&rsquo;s fundamental falsehood that racial feeling is a learned pathology rather than an innate feeling that evolved to protect the survival of racial groups. The destruction that that falsehood continues to wreak on Whites&rsquo; racial common sense is reason alone to never use the word.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a further reason for not using the r-word: Since the word has been used almost exclusively to accuse Whites of racism, it now unavoidably carries the association &#8220;whites-are-racists&#8221; into the brain of everyone who hears the word no matter what context you use it in!* When you use the r-word, at some level in the mind of all who are listening to you, you are affirming the charge that you are a racist!</p>
<p>But the MAIN point is: Instead of thrashing about defensively in the net that the anti-Whites&rsquo; imposed terminology has us caught in (have I illustrated at least a little bit the adage that he who controls the terminology controls the argument?), as we have been doing for 60 years and will continue to do if we continue to argue by using anti-White terminology, <i>we need to finally take the offensive and impose OUR terminology to level OUR charges AGAINST THEM, namely that they are ANTI-WHITES who support WHITE GENOCIDE!</i></p>
<p>Let the anti-Whites defend themselves against OUR charges while thrashing about caught in the net of OUR terminology! This is what anti-Whites are typically doing today when we use this approach on them, and it provides an edifying spectacle for whites who are observing the argument.</p>
<p><i>Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White!</i></p>
<p>*As with any rule, there are occasional exceptions, and the refrain this post ends in is one! (If you&rsquo;ve understood the rather unusual text of this post, you can amuse yourself by considering possible reasons the refrain is proving effective when used among mainstream whites).</p>

		<p>If they respond at all, I would expect a cowardly response. The left, of which academia is a part, loves to turn down open debate by saying that they cannot &#8220;lend legitimacy&#8221; to their ideological opposition, whatever that means. This of course is a disingenuous cop out when faced with the prospect of having to articulate and defend their favored ideologies. After all, in their minds, they already know they are right and they already know Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s wrong so what is to debate? The irony that they are an &#8220;academic&#8221; institution and at the same time anti-intellectual will be completely lost on them. &#8220;We&rsquo;re the *good* kind of close minded,&#8221; they&rsquo;ll reassure themselves.</p>

		<p>My letter to the Editor of the Highland Cavalier which they apparently will not publish:</p>
<p>Jared Taylor graduated from Yale in 1973 with a BA in Philosophy, and graduated from Institut d&rsquo;Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) in 1978 with a MA in International economics. He has also worked in west Africa, and has traveled the extensively. In addition to English, Taylor speaks perfect Japanese and French. Taylor may be many things, but &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; is not one of them.</p>
<p>Of course, ritual defamation of one&rsquo;s philosophical opponents is always easier than serious intellectual debate.</p>
<p>My prediction: no defender of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; at UVa-Wise will pick up the gauntlet and actually debate Taylor. Even if some professor did accept the challenge, the campus left will shows it true totalitarian colors by shouting down or otherwise shutting down the debate.</p>
<p>No debate will take place.</p>

<p>If you are opposed to the race-replcement of the Native Born White American Majority(which includes Americans of German ancestry such as you and I&hellip;and millions of other White Americans)..then I have no problem with you. If you are disgusted by Liberalism..then you belong to a very large club of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Germany unfortunately has plunged into degenerate social and cultural Liberalism. It is legal in Germany to sunbath nude in urban parks. I saw a Travel Channel show about Munich..and I was shocked..adult German men..no doubt homosexual-sunbathng in the presence of young German children and their parents.</p>
<p>Poland on the other hand is very socially conservative, as is Russia and Serbia. Serbia was recently threatened with another terror bombing by the war criminal Hillary Clinton if the Serbs disrupted a gay pride parade in the Serbian capitol.</p>
<p>You can take it to the bank that the very butch looking Angela Merkel is on board with this threat againt the Serbian people by the War Criminal Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Munich is in the Bavaria region which historically has been a conservative Catholic region in Germany. The social and cultural rot in Germany is very deep.</p>
<p>Since you came here when you were very young..and you are of German ancestry..consider yourself Native Born White American.</p>
<p>A majority of American soldiers who fought in WWW2 were of German ancestry.</p>
<p>I come from a large Irish Catholic family with a German surname. Raised Irish Catholic. My brothers and sisters and I, all have   married into the German and Italian genelines. </p>

I visited Germany for the first time in 30+ years three summers ago in order to see some of my aging uncles and aunts before they passed on.<br>
My general impressions were that the Germans have become a people without national pride or much hope for the future.  Patriotism seems to be scorned and they prefer to react to being overrun by Turks by burying their heads in the sand.<br>
Most blame America for the world&rsquo;s troubles and they either haven&rsquo;t learned, or choose to disregard their magnificent cultural, technical, artistic, and scientific heritage.<br>

		<p><b>Mr. Taylor (God bless him) also understands that though the issue is not complicated, getting across the ideals are tricky to a hostile and defensive host. And that may be the most difficult part.</b></p>
<p>The difficulty is in establishing the point that the native born white Americans have ethnic genetic interests and that these are worthy of being defended and are naturally defended in the paradigm of will to self defence.  </p>
<p>And so we have to begin somewhere.  </p>

<p>I sent this email to Mr. Taylor earlier today:</p>
<p>Dear Jared Taylor,</p>
<p>In a recent Amren article you expressed frustration at the lack of success over a period of years in getting our positions into the mainstream, and you stated that you are open to new ideas.</p>
<p>So I would like to recommend Bob Whitaker as a speaker at your conference, to discuss the very different methods he and his bugsters (I&rsquo;m proud to be one of them) are using to mainstream pro-White facts and terminology.</p>
<p>If Bob would be unable to deliver a presentation, some combination of Derek Black, Truck Roy, and Horus the Avenger would be able to give a very clear exposition of the approach we are using.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
[my name]<br>
(Harumphty Dumpty)</p>
<p>Jared replied quite understandably IMO that his general custom has been to invite only speakers whom he had heard give similar presentations elsewhere, and that he hadn&rsquo;t had the pleasure with Bob Whitaker, but that he would keep him in mind for future conferences.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of the faculty at UVa-Wise have been tempted to accept his challenge and then done a little research and found the video of a previous debate.</p>
<p>Probably many readers here have never seen this. Do yourselves a favor and take the 1 1/4 hour needed to watch the whole thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s domination of the debate is overwhelming, a complete triumph. Admittedly his opponent was a relative weaking and not a rabid Tim Wise who hogs the time and excretes a bewildering fog of rapid-fire PC jargon so conditions were favorable for Jared&rsquo;s polite but comprehensive delivery.</p>

I want some leaders that will spell it out plainly and NEVER apologize for telling the truth.</p>
