<h1>Man Charged with Burning Cross in Driveway</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Olwell, News Herald, November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent cross burning at the home of a Panama City mixed-race couple does not signal the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan; it was the symptom of something understandable to anyone who&rsquo;s ever been afraid of losing someone.</p>
<p>LB Williams, a 50-year-old black man, his wife of nearly seven years Donna Williams, who is white, and their bi-racial daughter found a cross burning in their driveway Nov. 4. Their grandchild was home too.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw that cross burning, I was scared to death,&#8221; Donna Williams said. &#8220;I was terrified&hellip;we all were.&#8221;</p>
<p>They called police and reported it. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It started out as a hate crime [investigation] based on the information that we had at the time,&#8221; said Sgt. Jeff Becker with the Panama City Police Department.</p>
<p>It was odd though; the investigator told Donna Williams that whoever left this symbol of hate and fear to burn in the driveway probably didn&rsquo;t want to damage the lawn or burn down the house.</p>
<p>Two days later, Donna found a note taped to the front door and the side entrance of the house. She paraphrased:</p>
<p>&#8220;They were watching us, I assumed me and the kids, and that I better not leave that [N-word],&#8221; Donna Williams said. The note was signed &#8220;KKK.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When did the KKK start supporting black and white, interracial marriages?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Police thought so too. On Monday, LB Williams admitted to setting the fire and posting the notes, according to the arrest affidavit charging him with two felonies: domestic violence stalking and exhibits that intimidate. He did it, he said, so she wouldn&rsquo;t proceed with the divorce she filed for.</p>

		<p>I first became aware of the phenomenon of &#8220;Vanity Arson&#8221; (setting the house on fire then &#8220;rescuing&#8221; your children to glean a spouses revived affections) on an old black and white movie. An effete man arranges for a local crook to &#8220;rob&#8221; him and his wife so he can appear heroic in fending off the &#8220;attack&#8221;. What the willing crook doesn`t realize is that the &#8220;hero&#8221; is going to kill him at the moment of attack to preserve his secret&hellip; Forget who the star was maybe the same guy who starred in the original All Quiet on the Western Front. It instilled in me a fear of playing &#8220;games&#8221; with other people`s lives as well as my own&hellip;</p>

<p>&#8220;Understandable to anyone who&rsquo;s ever been afraid of losing someone.&#8221;  Getting out of the news business and into the racial hoax justifying business, are we?</p>

		<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t this surprise me? Just like the noose that was found on the office door handle of a black studies &#8220;Professor&#8221; at Columbia University. The only problem with that one was the Police had Security video that showed the idiot &#8220;Professor&#8221; putting the noose on her own door. Oops. </p>
<p>None of any Cross burnings, in the past 20 years or so, or any other such things, has been by those that are actually in those groups. </p>
<p>They seem to know better, that it would not help their desired cause if they did it. </p>
<p>Consequently, when it does happen, you know immediately that it is some black or brown looking to scapegoat White people with convenient symbols from almost 80 years ago. </p>

&#8220;He truly is a good man. He doesn&rsquo;t drink&hellip;he works like a dog,&#8221; says his wife. What she doesn&rsquo;t say is if he&rsquo;s as faithful as a saint, or doesn&rsquo;t raise his hand against her.</p>
<p>This &#8220;truly good man&#8221; scares her and her children to death, with a burning cross, and even now gives the kid nightmares.</p>
<p>A truly good man.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King plagiarized the works of others, beat up prostitutes, hung around with America&rsquo;s enemies, and is exalted as a deity.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson played around with little boys, slept with scores of them, abused drugs, and is exalted as a great artist.</p>
<p>Also &#8220;truly good men&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>

<p>Notice how the very first paragraph attempts to minimize the actions of this criminal. Of course since whitey was made out to be the racist villain by this afro-American, no doubt made it all the more &#8220;understandable&#8221; in the mind of Chris Olwell.</p>

		<p>White woman plans to leave violent black husband. K burns cross in her driveway, leaving behind note demanding she cancel the divorce!</p>
<p>This was almost funny until I read the sickening opening paragraph where this p.c. journalist portrays a wife-beater and stalker who perpetrated a racial hoax as a heartbroken romantic-at-heart.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting isn&rsquo;t it? Very often we find that &#8216;antisemitic&rsquo; incidents - vandalism in cemeteries etc -  are also perpetrated by Jews - for a variety of reasons. Some are deranged, others are &#8216;doing their bit&rsquo; to keep up the pretense that they are deserving of victim status. I guess it can be the same with other ethnics. Plus ca change&hellip;</p>

		<p>Please do not judge this black too harshly.</p>
<p>What I feel he is doing is what many blacks would like to do return to their Golden Era on the Plantation.</p>
<p>Working for a kind white master who fed, clothed, housed and cared for them and their families.</p>

<p>Very true. I have read so many of these &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; are committed by the very so-called &#8220;victims&#8221; so as to bolster their assertions that it is mainly us White folk who commit the deeds. Whenever I hear another of these stories I immediately KNOW it was done by the &#8220;minority&#8221; themselves.</p>
