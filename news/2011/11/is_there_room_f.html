			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brit Middleton, BET, October 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new documentary shines a light on Silicon Valley, the place where Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former Apple CEO and founder Steve Jobs got their start, but not for its historic record of producing the next great breakthroughs in technology but, instead, for its apparent lack of diversity.</p>
<p>In the CNN documentary series, &#8220;Black in America,&#8221; eight Black entrepreneurs in the NewMe Accelerator program share their struggles to launch start-up businesses in a place where minority representation is virtually nonexistent. In an interview that ignited a firestorm on Twitter this week, Mike Arrington, an industry leader and founder of TechCrunch, revealed an even harsher reality: &#8220;This is a white and Asian world up here  &mdash;  it just is,&#8221; he said. Arrington, who also commented that he doesn&rsquo;t know of a single Black entrepreneur in the Valley, was harshly criticized for his apparent acceptance of the racial disparity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Blacks may work just as hard to get their businesses off the ground, there appears to be a different set of standards they face, from outward appearances to the ideas they pitch to investors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The documentary, &#8220;The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley,&#8221; the fourth episode in the CNN &#8220;Black in America&#8221; series, premieres on November 13 at 8 p.m. ET.</p>

<p>Huh? There are probably as many Asians, Indians and Arabs in Silicon Valley as there are whites.</p>
<p>But there are few blacks so instead of looking in the mirror they blame &hellip; guess who?</p>

		<p>What could your average, low-I.Q. black possibly bring to the table in Silicon Valley? </p>
<p>Silicon Valley is full of smart, White nerds and Asian nerds - the kind of guys who got made fun of in college for studying on the night of the Halloween frat parties or on Christmas Day! These guys OWN Silicon Valley and guess what? THEY SHOULD!!!!!</p>
<p>They worked hard!  They put the time and effort in! They are marketing geniuses! </p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t hack it, don&rsquo;t complain and don&rsquo;t try to bring the &#8220;poor pitiful me, I&rsquo;m black&hellip;&#8221; card into it. </p>

		<p>Another example of Black-Run America (BRA) at work again&hellip;Now, we have BET and CNN coming to Silicon Valley and using their weight to muscle the big tech firms into hiring unqualified blacks and setting up contracts with black venture capitalists-many of whom are scam artists without the wherewithal to get things done on their own&hellip;so they whined and tugged on CNN&rsquo;s skirt to make a big stink out of it. CNN = Crybaby News Network! </p>

		<p>Compare Mike Arrington&rsquo;s view &ldquo;This is a white and Asian world up here &mdash; it just is&rdquo; with yesterday&rsquo;s posting by Dilon Twity. One one hand, there is a black man working to advance the interests of his group. I can empathize (but not sympathize) with him. </p>
<p>Twety, on the other hand, attacks and vilifies the group that he belongs to. There is no doubt who is the more dangerous.</p>

		<p>Bottom line - no company is ever going to turn down an invention they think they could market and will make them money, they only see green not black, White or brown. How many &#8220;breakthroughs of technology&#8221; have come out of Africa lately? About the only things blacks are really good at creating are drama, chaos and distruction! Now if they were paid for that, they&rsquo;d all be millionaires!</p>

		<p>It might annoy us to see that some think that there should be a number of black entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley proportional to the number of blacks in the population. But the real problem here is that young blacks believe this, and feel hammered down and hurt when they can&rsquo;t make it. Every day, in universities and in the press, leftists are raising unreasonable expectations for blacks, and this can&rsquo;t possibly lead to anything good. What is needed is some kind of outreach program where blacks, too, learn the truth about racial differences.</p>

		<p>I worked in silicon valley proper for 20 years. I never saw a single black engineer. Not one. </p>
<p>WHO ARE these blacks in this incubator? Are they ENGINEERS? Doubt it. They copy the MOTIONS of what white people SEEM to be doing, put on the suit, but never copy what happens inside the head. </p>
<p>There are successful black entreprenuers. Famous Amos comes to mind. But cookie chips are a lot simpler than silicon chips. </p>

<p>Indians are White, but asians are classified minorities by our goverment. There are numerous asian run companies. When BET says minority they mean black. I doubt they want the goverment to give them some small company that imports parts.</p>
<p>They probably want the goverment to give them Apple to run into the ground.</p>

<p><i> While Blacks may work just as hard to get their businesses off the ground, there appears to be a different set of standards they face, from outward appearances to the ideas they pitch to investors.</i> </p>
<p>There <i>appears</i> to be a different set of standards? Appears to whom? Who disagrees and why?</p>
<p>I would say this bias is due to the fact that this story appeared on BET, but the rest of the media is just as squeamish about discussing the real issues.</p>
<p>Notice the documentary is called  &ldquo;The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley,&rdquo; rather than something like &#8220;Can Blacks Cut It In Silicon Valley? Why or Why Not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twenty years from now they&rsquo;ll still be wondering why there aren&rsquo;t more blacks in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Now the race is one to find at least one black man who can succeed in Silicon Valley to prove the racists wrong.</p>
<p>As BookerT noted, blacks are incessantly told that they equal to, if not better at everything, than the white man and the only reason they fail is because of the racist white man and his system of white privilege.</p>
<p>Combine unrealistic expectations, equality propaganda, over-inflated egos, and racial resentment and you have the modern African-American.</p>

<p>Much of the trouble began decades ago, when droves of blacks left farm work and moved into the cities.  And now, decades later, after billions of dollars, BLOOD, sweat, and tears, they are nowhere, even when a black insinuated himself into the highest office in the land.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got it!  </p>
<p>After talking today with a friend in Sonoma County, California where the growers are complaining that their illegal workers have disappeared, whites came out to do it, yes they did! BUT, they just made a fraud news report that shows interviews with a few old women, one who had to work all day with many breaks, just to earn $25.00 (she said she&rsquo;d go buy some food).  Another one gave up after three hours, complaining about her back (she&rsquo;s over 60).  Then, the spot showed the grower complaining that whites can&rsquo;t do the work.  Heck, they don&rsquo;t know how to pick, he said.  The one that said that was a yam farmer.  He said they couldn&rsquo;t pick yams right (how hard is that?).  So Sonoma County made the Mexican&rsquo;s ID cards acceptable as driver&rsquo;s licenses.  My friend says that the driving hazards there are high now, and the Mexicans drink a lot of beer after work.  </p>
<p>As I exclaimed above, I&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>The solution is tho herd all these flash mobbing blacks onto farms and have them taught the fine art of picking crops. And since 60+ year old ladies can&rsquo;t do it right, maybe those out of work OWS kids would like some activity for a change?</p>
<p>America was once a solid, agricultural society and 90% white.  We knew how to grow and pick our own food, make our own gadgets, and run our lives well enough before all this Diversity and scam employers took over.  When harvest time came, all the family worked on it.  Maybe a 60+ year old can&rsquo;t pick more than  20 hours a week, but we have more and more of us.  I am willing to work picking 20 hours a week, even with my arthritis.  Is it all or nothing?  Maybe it&rsquo;s time to take OWS to the farm?</p>
<p>But the fact is, blacks were better off when they were rural and working on farms.</p>

		<p>No. In white mans world sometimes you really cant fake it and have to be really smart. <br>
Blacks have always had the propensity to lie their butt off and thats why Cain who never held office is jutting up plus he never rode a public bus and had to sit in the back.</p>
<p>The funny thing is white America is brainwashed and only told half the story on integration that overtook separate but equal. </p>
<p>In the south there were more cities who voted NOT to integrate with whites than vice versa but of course this was covered up by the lib neocon media. Blacks preferred living in their own shacks as opposed to govt housing rent Sec 8 and preferred their own schools where they did much better than todays thugs and pimps.</p>
<p>It wasnt the whites who protested integration, it was the blacks.</p>

		<p>Given everything we know about IQ distribution among Africans and African-Americans, it seems as though there should be at least a small number of black geniuses or at least highly gifted blacks. </p>
<p>Even if only 1% or even less of blacks are gifted, that is still tens of thousands in the US, plus African immigrants. </p>
<p>There should be a small but nonetheless significant of highly gifted Black engineers, surgeons, mathematicians, etc.</p>
<p>Where are they? One would expect a great deal of publicity to surround each genuinely genius black.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain this?</p>

		<p>I can explain it. </p>
<p>Near Genius level is typically a 160-180 IQ level. </p>
<p>Gifted is the 140 IQ level. </p>
<p>Among whites, Gifted might appear at a 1 in 10,000 rate and near genius at a 1 in 100,000 rate. </p>
<p>But among blacks, Gifted barely appears at all, at the 1 in 1,000,000 rate and Near Genius is non existent. So among the 20 million blacks in America, they may have only 20 people who actually are gifted. But among the 150 million whites, there are 15,000 gifted or better.</p>
<p>So while there are a fair number of blacks who function above their 85 average IQ as many black Americans are actually 50% white genetically or even 90% white and still call themselves black. </p>
<p>But true gifted genius level people simple doesn&rsquo;t exist among blacks, not even in black hybrids. </p>

		<p>As a White who had to compete with other startups for scarce dollars around 2000, I can tell you who the competition was. How about nerdy Whites with a Phd in Computer science who are very creative. Or how about Jews with 150 IQ&rsquo;s who are willing to work 100 hours a week, have an inherent grasp of business and who are also very original thinkers. Or endless Indians or East Asians who are willing to have no life for years on end. Now I have never met a Black who has a Phd in Computer Science. Or who will work 100 hours a week. Or is a great businessman. Anymore questions?</p>
