<p>Wrong.  That issue has been blown way out of proportion, when the answer is really simple.  Talking heads blabbered on about his &#8220;What if the South Won&#8221; song, but that was cut in 1988, three years before he started to sing the MNF theme.</p>
<p>No, the real reason is that HWJr made a flippant remark about Hitler, when a Jewish CEO (Bob Iger, Disney) signs his paycheck.  That&rsquo;s all there is to it.  Let that be a moral lesson to you   &mdash;   No flippant remarks about Hitler, ever.</p>

<p>then political correctness might just be what you call &#8216;common sense&rsquo;</p>

		<p>At this point I must ask. Has Hank Williams Jr. done anything to support the white race? <br>
Has he made any donations to pro-white groups? <br>

		<p>So-called political correctness is nothing more than steadfast and ignorant denial of reality.  Even the term itself is profoundly anti-democratic, since it implies that our thoughts, actions, and utterances must conform to some pre-determined (read leftist)code.</p>
<p>As I recall, the term PC originally was an expression of derision and contempt directed at those lacking the intellect to think for themselves.  Now it&rsquo;s proudly used by those mindless ninnies who wear their ignorance and stupidity as badges of honor.</p>

		<p>So, 79% of people (polled) think political correctness is a problem but you won&rsquo;t see that same majority doing or saying anything politically INcorrect.  It will remain a problem as long as everyone stays in lockstep.  Branch out, speak your mind, stand up to the stupidity of PC-ism, and maybe it can be turned around.  Do nothing, and it will just get worse.  That&rsquo;s exactly how it got to be such a problem in the first place.</p>
<p>It is good news, however, that the poll showed a 5% increase in one year.  Maybe a new anti-Occupy war cry can be &#8220;we are the 79%!&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Well duh, even the nonwhites hate PC. They know it&rsquo;s stupid, but they are glad to take the benefits it offers. They know on a base level that whites are just better achievers overall, that men and women are fundamentally different and have different roles, those seem like just as obvious of a fact as gravity. Actually more obvious. I bet slightly more blacks could correctly tell you that whites have a higher average intelligence than could give you a 4th grade explanation of gravity.</p>
<p>PC ruins us because it kills our ability to have &#8220;friendly&#8221; racism towards eachother. Lighthearted joking (PLUS the ability to live separately most of the time) is the best way for people to get along despite differences. Whites and blacks self segregate in large part because it&rsquo;s awkward. Friend groups like to make fun of eachother and it is awkward to make fun of someone from a protected race these days. We get along better if we&rsquo;re able to just say to eachother &#8220;ha, ha, black people have big lips&#8221; and &#8220;ha ha, white people used to own black people&#8221; and just genuinely laugh about it and move on.</p>

I went to the funeral service for Larry Hovis,aka Sgt. Carter on Hogans Heroes. He had spent the last two decades of his life teaching dramatics at a private University. The service was held in the Auditorium there. It was a crowd filled with his current and former students as well as a few 60`s TV fans like myself.<br>
 First they showed a film clip of him as a nebbish hit-man, begging Doris Day to stand still long enough to kill her. The mourners roared with laughter.  Then they showed his most famous routine, lampooning the Fuhrer as he used to do so well on the hit show. God he even looked a lot like him! But the audience let out an audible hiss of disdain and anger. One kid in front of me said, to his friend, &#8220;They used to think this was FUNNY?!?!&#8221;  It was an alarming introduction into the dynamics of political correctness and group think on today`s campus.  Coming out into the sunlight my own friend said, &#8220;Did we just witness a New Soviet Man Moment or what?&#8221;&hellip;..<br>

		<p>Political Correctness is the template for the destruction of Western man. European culture which is the light of the world is intentionally being erased through the political and social doctrine of PC. Yes White America is dying out but it is so much bigger than that&hellip; European man himself is dying out. Rhodesia is the perfect example of what the world is slowly coming to. </p>

<p>Tim, do you ever watch Seinfield re runs?  That show was only about 15 years ago.  I watch it at 10 pm most nights because it is the best thing on all 200 channels.</p>
<p>Compared to today, Seinfield is very un PC.  Some of his episodes would not have been written today because PC has gotten so bad.  </p>
<p>There was a Seinfield episode where Elaine&rsquo;s boss looked<br>
like Hitler and made a speech.  Then there was the Amer Indian girl who found bigotry in every word, the Jamaican who needed 5 alarm clocks to get out of bed for the marathon and other episodes that are very PC today.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between wanting to be nice and understanding the true implications. We speak to much in code already. There is a happy medium between hate speech and expressing how we really feel.</p>
