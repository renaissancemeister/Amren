<h1>The African Population Disaster</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gwynne Dyer, Trinidad Express, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to the United Nations, the world&rsquo;s population will pass the seven billion mark at the end of this month, and there will be much tutting and shaking of heads over its prediction that we will be ten million by the end of the century. But almost nobody will have the temerity to point out that this is almost entirely an African problem.</p>
<p>The United Nations Population Fund&rsquo;s own numbers tell the story. Africa currently has one-seventh of the world&rsquo;s people: just over one billion. But during the rest of the century, the UN agency predicts, this single continent will add an extra 2.6 billion people, more than tripling in population, while all the rest of the world adds just half a billion.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for the African population boom, the world&rsquo;s population would never exceed 7.5 billion. That is still probably twice as many people as the planet&rsquo;s resources could support comfortably for more than a couple of generations  &mdash;  but birth rates are falling to below replacement level in most places. If that were happening in Africa too, the global population could be headed back down well before 2100.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t happening in Africa, or at least not nearly fast enough. Nor is the UN naively projecting current birth rates into the indefinite future. It assumes that the current average fertility rate for the African continent of 4.6 children per woman will fall to only three children per woman by 2045, though some countries  &mdash;  Niger, Mali and Uganda, for example  &mdash;  will continue to have higher birth rates.</p>
<p>The problem is that replacement level is 2.2 children per woman. Africa may well reach that level by late in the century, but the population growth will continue for a further 30-40 years, until the last generation from the baby-boom days has grown up and had its own 2.2 children per family. So a total African population of 3.6 billion by the end of the century  &mdash;  a third of the human race  &mdash;  is probably as good as it is going to get.</p>
<p>If African birth-rates do not decline steeply, it could be a great deal worse. If the current rate of African population growth persisted, we would have a global total of 15 billion people by the end of the century, with about half of them crammed into that single continent. But let&rsquo;s go with the optimistic assumption that there will be &#8220;only&#8221; ten billion of us.</p>
<p>What will the African population boom mean for the rest of the world, and for Africa itself? It may be a surprisingly self-contained disaster.</p>
<p>An Africa that more than triples its population during the rest of this century will certainly still be the world&rsquo;s poorest continent at the end of it. Even the current improvement in economic growth rates in many African countries is largely cancelled out by population growth: few countries are seeing significant rises in per capita income.</p>
<p>If Africans stay poor, then their impact on the rest of the world will be slight. They will not become major consumers of resources imported from elsewhere, because they cannot afford them. Even their impact on the global environment, while not negligible, will be quite limited. It is high-income consumers of energy, manufactured goods and processed foods who really count when it comes to global issues like climate change.</p>
<p>Three hundred million Americans have more effect on the global environment than would three billion Africans living more or less in their present style. Subsistence farmers mostly affect the local environment, even when there are a lot of them. If they degrade their land, pollute their rivers and destroy their forests, the damage they do is mostly to themselves. Urban slum dwellers do even less damage to the global environment.</p>
<p>If no miracle intervenes, the African continent is going to have a very hard time in this century. It is already the only continent to experience recurrent famines, and they will probably get much worse. Civil wars and massacres are already more frequent in Africa than anywhere else, and that too will get worse, because people under great pressure rarely behave well.</p>
<p>What, if anything, can be done about this? Even a big push to make contraception available to the hundred million African women who do not now have easy access to it would not substantially change the outcome at this point. Only a brutally enforced one-child policy like China&rsquo;s could do that, and it is simply impossible to believe that this could be done in any African state.</p>
<p>Africans have done nothing wrong, nor indeed is their birth-rate higher than those on other continents at various past times. But there is only a limited time available to get the birth-rate down once modern medicine and sanitation have brought the death-rate down.</p>
<p>Grow fast enough economically, and your people will have smaller families as they get more prosperous. Stay poor for too long, and population growth will overwhelm you. For various reasons, none of them their own fault, Africans have stayed poor for too long. Individual countries can still save themselves, and some will, but the continent as a whole probably cannot.</p>
<p>Few Africans will say that because it&rsquo;s too painful to contemplate, and few outsiders will say it because it is politically incorrect. But a lot of people know it.</p>

		<p>The article seems to make the assumptions that these Africans will remain in Africa.</p>
<p>What do you think the chances of that are?</p>
<p>The world (at least the West) is about to be inundated with Africans.</p>
<p>The lowest achievers in the world will turn natural selection on its head and dominate.</p>
<p>Of course, if we had the will, this disaster could be avoided, but we don&rsquo;t have the will.</p>

		<p>The reporter writes: &#8220;Africans have done nothing wrong, nor indeed is their birth-rate higher than those on other continents at various past times&#8221;</p>
<p>&hellip;and then a virtual repeat of this can be seen in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Where I come from, if one has little or no food and little or no income and also little or no contraception, then one ceases sexual relations so that one doesn&rsquo;t give birth to more children, which in turn makes the entire family and community of families poorer.  Africans don&rsquo;t do this.  They continue to have more and more children.</p>
<p>I also found it strange that the reporter states that a one-child-only rule is unenforceable then turns around and says the more prosperous they get, the fewer children they will have.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t the one-child rule be enforced?  And then what makes her think that more prosperous Africans will be inclined to have lower birth rates?</p>
<p>Finally, why is it so necessary for her to repeat that the plight of the Africans is not their own fault.  Isn&rsquo;t it?  In-fighting, ignorance, high birth rates, and failing despite all the aid, education, and money the First World has given them?  I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s squarely their fault.</p>

		<p>So the almighty UN has noticed that in spite of a century of Western do-gooder uplift programs, Africans are breeding themselves into even greater squalor than they&rsquo;ve had in the past. How very perceptive of them.</p>
<p>Just exactly what do they think is going to &#8220;fix&#8221; this state?  Why, still more Western handouts, of course.  And what do they think is the cause?  From the number of times this hand-wringing article hammers home the mantra that none of this is the fault of the Africans themselves, I&rsquo;d say they know full well what the root cause is, but will never, <i>ever</i> admit it.<br>

		<p>These same projections have Nigeria at over 730 million people at the end of this century.</p>
<p>The problem with the projections is that it assumes that the underlying reason for black African fecundity, that is, food, water and medical aid from the white world, will continue.  At the rate we&rsquo;re going, we&rsquo;re not going to have it to give, as more and more of our racial pity resources get diverted to the fast increasing internal minority (eventually majority) population.  Another matter that might complicate things is that various white countries might start electing &#8220;hard hearted&#8221; race realists or white nationalists, or even rightist-environmentalists who will cut off this aid even if it is abundantly available.</p>
<p>As an aside, rapid African population growth does have an affect on the ecology of the continent.</p>

		<p>&#8220;For various reasons, none of them their own fault, Africans have stayed poor for too long.&#8221;  Then whose fault is it?  As here, $17 trillion and 40 years later after the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; nonsense, blacks are still obsessed about long ago slavery wrongs and &#8220;we will overcome&#8221;.  Unfortunately, someone will have to step in and impose mandatory birth control.  If not now then soon in the future as the Western countries cannot afford to keep feeding and taking them in.</p>

		<p>The most recent issue of National Geographic touched on this subject. Part of the focus was on how over population in Africa is causing affecting wild life conservation.They showed several pictures of Africans carrying automatic weapons. Thanks to people like Bob Geldof and Bono of U2. Did they really think all that money they raised for Africans was going to be used for food and medicine. I also liked the picture of all the women holding children thank to rape. But as usual with National Geographic in the end things are just Jolly. Its all whiteys fault.</p>

		<p>HA! Africans are poor (and it is not their fault at all) and Africans have the right to determine their birth rates? Please. Yes there are countries with low fertility rates that are poor, but Africans cannot expect to progress to a high income society until they themselves collectively decide to champion family planning. </p>

		<p>Islam will take care of the population problem in Africa just as they did in the 1600&rsquo;s, 1700&rsquo;s and 1800&rsquo;s.

<p>Now, in their insatiable quest to expand Islam by obeying Allah&rsquo;s orders in the Koran, they will slaughter Africans by the millions and millions until Africa will finally submit to Islam.</p>

<p>As for Africa and the blacks something has to be done and soon about their procreating practices. As one poster stated that it may sound &#8220;cruel&#8221; to stop all aid and charity we give these Africans, but it is NOT cruel. They will overtake all Western nations and then what do you think will happen to the White race of the world? What they are now doing and will do to Whites is what will be CRUEL and inhumane. We have to stop this feeling guilty because WE are the ones who deserve to LIVE and procreate. If we don&rsquo;t deserve to live then why does anyone THINK that the Africans deserve to live? That is what it is going to come down to. You know it and I know it.</p>
<p>We are the only race that has given to the world in every instance and it has to stop because we have created a world where our own children will be sacrificed to these who we &#8220;helped&#8221; all these years. </p>
<p>So which will it be? Cave in or stand up and stop our insanity?</p>

		<p>Why are some of the comments saying that a world with 10 to 15 billion Africans is bad for Europe? The wikipedia article for sub-Saharan African states that there were 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. 800 million is already too much. While it&rsquo;s true that illegal African immigration is a problem for Europe, the problem isn&rsquo;t as grim as some of the comments are making the situation out to be despite the Africa&rsquo;s current, abject overpopulation issue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already seeing a political shift in Europe to the right. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, stated directly that multiculturalism has failed. The same has been said by many mainstream politicians in Europe. As the problem with Muslims and other hostile aliens in Europe continues to grow, the political situation will continue to shift more and more to the right. By 2100, Europe will probably be so right-wing that African immigration to Europe, legal or otherwise, will not be tolerated at all.</p>

<p>Very true. And of course it is the west that assures Africa&rsquo;$ survival. The writer assumes that the world will continue turning as is and the west will continue to support Africa with foodstuffs, medicine, technology, money, etc. Unfortunately for the dependent Africans, total economic collapse appears imminent for the west. (IMO, Greece is only the beginning) When/IF this occurs, westerners will be preoccupied with their own survival and feeding hungry Africans will not be a priority. This of course will have a tremendous effect on the populations of black Africa, Haiti, etc. <br>

		<p>#15  &mdash;  That was in case any lurkers showed up.  I am not a cruel person, but when we help these Africans, we&rsquo;re just doing more harm than good.  We feed them, they breed more, they demand MORE money, rinse, repeat.  People need to stop getting emotional and start reasoning.</p>
<p>Time to cut off the aid.  I would hope that a thinking person would look past the &#8220;it sounds cruel&#8221; and look at what could happen further down the line.  They managed to survive somehow without our aid for millennia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that the same people that screech about overpopulation (which is not even a problem to begin with) have their hands out for money to perpetuate this problem.  Just another case of inconsistency/hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>Africa may be vast, but its cultivable land is finite. Deserts and jungles do not support high populations.</p>
<p>The continent exceeded its optimal population to cultivable land ratio a century ago. It was the intervention of Western-influenced farming, Western medicines, Western technology, Western food aid, and the introduction of new crops which has caused the African population to exceed the carrying capacity of the land.</p>

<p>You are harboring a misconception. Evolution does not necessarily lead to more intelligent people. Evolution leads to people well adapted to their environment. Africans are much better suited to successful white nations than white people. Welfare or not, there is money to be made, if not by the social office, then by hustling junk on the street or by crime. There is fresh water in the taps, electricity in two holes in the wall, real medicine in the pharmacies and the roads do not become mud rivers when it rains. Much better than Africa.</p>
<p>Whites do best when they live all their lives in poverty in a harsh climate. When hes poor, he cant pay welfare, and he cant buy junk on the street, he has no possessions to steal and most importantly, he cant afford electricity and a mind numbing TV.</p>
<p>When whitey gets rich, he, with very few exceptions, gets decadent and becomes an easy prey for all kinds of hungry opportunists. So, in the end, poverty is the best of all worlds for white people, until we breed a new kind of whitey that doesn&rsquo;t get decadent with increasing wealth. </p>

		<p>This Michael Fay when he did his mega-transect of central Africa found 2,000 year old piles of cola nuts where ever he went. Evidently the central part of Africa was supporting a very substantial population at that time that just DISAPPEARED. Something like AIDS came out of the jungle and wiped all those folks out.</p>
<p>When the first whitey explorers such as Livingston crossed Africa they remarked as to the lack of population and the open lands without people or any populace of any sort, just the sort of place good for whitey colonists. NOT now.</p>

		<p>Stop sending aid of any sort, (medicine, food, money, education, etc.) to the entire continent of Africa. Leave and close the door behind us. Let them fight it out among themselves and fend for themselves for about 200 years of total isolation from the rest of the world, then our descendants can go take a look if they want to and see what has happened to them. My bet is they will find what the first white explorers did, a sparsely settled expanse of virgin land teeming with wildlife. Without western intervention in ANY way whatsoever, Africans will find some way to manage themselves. If it takes the mass murder and/or starvation of half the continent&rsquo;s human inhabitants, so be it. It will have been done by and for Africans themselves.</p>

		<p>Warning, this post will depress you. If you are feeling particularly discouraged about the future you might just want to skip over this post. It could well be the thing that sends you over the edge. </p>
<p>Alexandra &amp; #23:  Those kinds of populations cannot be sustained without substantial food aid. Even the present population of Africa cannot be sustained without food &amp; medical aid. The United States is currently producing a little more than 30% of the entire worlds food supply. We are reaching a point with the decline in the number of farms in America, oil supplies running out, arable land becoming salty due to irrigation and fertilizer use that the global production of food is going to sharply decline. This problem is also occurring in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the Ukraine, and Russia at the same time. When the oil runs out, or gets prohibitively expensive our methods of agriculture are going to have to change radically away from intensive farming. This is going to be a big adjustment for the world, and it wont just be Africa where famine is a *tangible* problem. </p>
<p>High intensity farming is not possible without petroleum products &hellip;period&hellip; If you chart the population of Africa with oil production its a nearly linear fit for almost 90 years, but it has taken on a life of its own as the populations there are still in a breeding cycle during the early decline of global oil supplies. Africa never would have been able to expand its population without oil, and without our intensive farming practices to insulate them from famine. For that matter world population everywhere would never have achieved the levels it has without oil production. </p>
<p>When the oil runs out, we are going to see a correction that will reduce the world population by several billion people over a very short period of time. Anywhere from 3 to 8 billion people are likely to die over a single decade, and they will continue to die for another decade as resources become even more scarce due to poor land management practices in Africa, and as world agriculture shifts to a more local oriented production, and consumption pattern. As impressive as the increases in production from genetically modified pesticide, and herbicide resistant crops have been; the chemicals used have so deeply contaminated much of the land used to grow corn, and soybeans that it will be impossible to reclaim much of that farmland for crop rotation for 10, maybe even 20 years. A perfect storm of calamity is brewing, and the world leaders are amazingly silent about it. Famine, and political unrest are the reasons our government is building those FEMA detention centers to house 30 million people or more. When our own government is taking steps to prepare for how truly ugly this event is going to be here we should stand up, and take note of it. </p>
<p>If history can be used a guide, wars in Africa will not cause the type of population decline needed, and are truly insignificant in terms of the overall population. From 1960 through 2006 direct combat deaths in Africa only total a little more than 1.5 million people. Indirect deaths are likely 10x that amount, but 15 million people is a drop in the bucket compared to the population growth in Africa from 1960 through 2006. Nigera alone went from a population of roughly 91 million, to a population of over 151 million in a mere 18 years from 1990 through 2008. Only a few million of this total is due to displacement migration from war zones. The numbers are not pretty. Africa has tremendous problems with wars, especially civil wars, but African war fighters are notoriously ineffective at actually killing people with small arms. They destroy lots of things, and the wars cause intense poverty. However, the main effect is simply to shift populations from one country to the surrounding countries as refugees flee. </p>
<p>The coming famine is going to be absolutely ugly, and will touch every continent. Home gardens, and indeed public gardens may literally become lifelines in North America, Asia, Europe, South America, and even a few parts of Africa where the population can be organized to make use of every spec of available land. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to play the role of Dr. Doom, but if the peak oil numbers hold true (and I think they are optimistic) we will see this kind of calamity within the the next 20 to 30 years. If you don&rsquo;t have a garden, its a good time to get started now, and figure out how to preserve food for winter storage. Passing on this knowledge, and experience to your family members, and friends may be the only thing that keeps you, and your children alive as we transition to other sources of energy, and more sustainable agricultural practices. </p>

		<p>The article says : <br>
&#8220;They are going to remain poor because their population will grow fast&#8221;.<br>
But if a population is able to produce, and invests much, the newcomers will have a job and produce (the US population, or the quebec population, have grown very fast, and have not become poor, as many European populations in the XIXth century).<br>
But Africans are relatively unable to produce, and won&rsquo;t invest. So their main ressources will be raw material (oil, diamond, gold, etc.) and foreign aid. That&rsquo;s the reason for which what the article says is true : their interest is to be as few as possible. <br>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a psychological phenomenon that women have over the sensual feeling of having babies. Almost oblivious that they will eventually grow up and leave the home. It&rsquo;s a sense of denial almost, that these mothers have. While White American women also have these tendencies, it sounds like an epidemic in some third world hell holes. Arab women are in the same position, due to the bastardization of Islam, and twisting the teachings. </p>

<p>She and other European &#8220;leaders&#8221; can mouth this all they want to appease the right. Talk is cheap.  Has non-White immigration to Britain been stopped or even curtailed?  Has Germany made any attempt to expel the approximately four million Turks that have formed &#8221; a parallel&#8221; culture in Germany?

<p>Meanwhile, Moslems and other non-Whites continue to multiply rapidly in Europe and as the African population continues to explode, massive pressure will be put on European countries, the United States and Canada by the UN to accept millions of destitute fecund Africans.

My reason for not giving to charity is to try to stem what I see going on everywhere - that is: the least capable are breeding and we are paying them to do so. One of the earlier commenters stated it in so many words, stop providing free food, medical care, shelter clothes, etc. to people who refuse to help themselves. &#8220;Millions for defense, not a cent for tribute.&#8221; This is still a good mantra.</p>

		<p>#15 &mdash; That was in case any lurkers showed up. I am not a cruel person, but when we help these Africans, we&rsquo;re just doing more harm than good. We feed them, they breed more, they demand MORE money, rinse, repeat. People need to stop getting emotional and start reasoning.</p>
<p>I so agree with you and have said the same numerous times.  I used to donate money for the African hungry. The Catholic church has a big drive in my country every Lenten season. You  have seen the  pictures that tug on your conscience.  After twenty years or so and nothing had changed, it became obvious that where there had been five hungry kids, they had grown up and there now were 25. We are feeding a problem. It is terrible and what are you to do as a Christian? </p>
<p>The example Jesus gave in the story of the Samaritan was a man who had fallen among the robbers, a guy in dire straits not due to his making. He is not someone who merrily procreates and lets others feed his offspring. Paul says, a man who does not provide for his own is worse than an infidel.  </p>
<p>It is a tough one, back when they were still living in the stone age, they were not exactly the happy, &#8220;noble savage&#8221; either, or people like Albert Schweitzer would not have dedicated their lives, sacrificed family, to help the miserable blacks. In 1948 there were still cannibals in the Belgian Congo. Why do we think that we are responsible for solving their problems? Because we &#8220;brought civilisation&#8221; to them?  In this day and age, can whole continents be left to stone age people? (Africa and North America). </p>

		<p>Un-indoctrinated and John Engleman, speaking for myself, I have no children and never desired them because I saw what a devastating effect two kids had on my young parents, who never took a dime in public assistance.</p>
<p>I also think that the early missionaries to Africa, correct me if I am wrong, taught Christianity, namely Catholicism, which taught to be fruitful and multiply and to never use contraception and those teachings stuck.  Coupled with Western aid, the population exploded.</p>
<p>I agree with Engleman, too, in stating that it was the men who wanted more children.  In Africa, it&rsquo;s always been a status symbol amongst men.  They think it proves their virility.  As each child died of starvation, one by one, the women would desire more pregnancies so as to replace the deceased children.  This habit stuck, too.</p>

		<p>The reason why the people in the the prosperous west do not have children whilst the starving have more than they can afford to feed are identical. Even 100 years ago in the west if a woman lost her husband and did not have family only the small proportion of wealthy did not land up in the gutter. Too old and sick to work, without family you die. When two out of three children die in childhood you have to have at least six to make sure you have someone left to support you in your old age. To the average Westeners it makes no difference if they have children or not, they have pensions and healthcare and social security, to most in the underdevoloped world it is their only lifeline. The faster the African population grows, the less they will be able to educate their children or to provide comprehensive healthcare and thus they will only push the birthrate up. Mother Nature has always had ways of solving these problems but as long as the West will interfere with nature the problem is insoluble.</p>

		<p>Charity groups should focus entirely on BIRTH CONTROL. Hunger will take care of itself if these people stop breeding irresponsibly. If Westerners really want to help them, we need to recolonize these third world countries and be their nanny / parent figure. Many third worlders would actually prefer this. What stops them is resistance from brutal marxist war lords and sniveling white liberals. For them, anything is better than benevolent white rule&hellip;.even rape, AIDS, and genocide.

		<p>In all seriousness, if we&rsquo;re going to continue sending food to Africa we should start lacing it with birth control drugs. The only problem that could arise is that males eating the birth control laced food would start developing female sex characteristics. I came up with this idea after reading about how putting the pill in feed for wild animals might be used to control over population. Then again, China may turn Africa into one big colony of their own and impose their &#8220;draconian&#8221; one child per woman policy on the natives. As a white nationalist, I would be thrilled if something like that happened.</p>

		<p>Many sound observations in the comments above need to be integrated, and made the basis, first of media opinion and then of political action.  Not much time remains.</p>
<p>A brief note on Christianity, which some regard as an unrealistic religion of sentimental altruism and consequently racial suicide. Without wishing to enter a larger debate, let  alone discuss RC objections to artificial birth control and eugenic abortion, I would add that, properly read, the Good Samaritan parable is about help for a mugging victim by a temporary visitor at his own expense in a critique of ritual purity regulations. A modern parallel with those who &#8220;passed by&#8221; would be liberal apologists for muggers, or policemen who avoid a controversial crime scene.  It is not an argument for mass immigration or state welfare.</p>
<p>Only one other NT passage can be cited to support universal charity, Matthew 25.31-46.  This is generally misread as disapproval of anyone who fails to treat all the sick, hungry, migrants and convicts in the world with undiscriminating kindness.  In fact, it condemns those who fail to treat charitably the &#8220;brothers&#8221; of Jesus, i.e. Christians.  It threatens judgement on their persecutors, and is &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; in two additional respects: it recognises &#8220;nations&#8221; and believes in Hell.</p>

If a child comes out of a casual liaison - so what. The stud is long gone.<br>
The women are saddled with the responsibility of trying to raise the offspring</p>
<p>Where else in the world do you find uneducated females, who are unemployed and unemployable with on average about 6 kids from the same number of studs - and then expect someone else to pick up the tab to raise them, only to repeat the cycle once again?<br>
Answer - Africa; and the foolish writer of this article wants to continue supporting this cycle of irresponsible breeding with other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>Look on the blog - Mike&rsquo;s Political Commentary - for the articles about the increasing number of discarded black infants showing up in trash cans in South Africa, as well as the article on the number of unclaimed corpses - especially infants - at the Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto/Johannesburg </p>
<p>Today, South Africa is the most imbalanced socialist state in the world - the largest number of welfare recipients [about 50% of the population] surviving off the smallest tax base. This is the consequence of a black government who create and produce nothing of worth for the population. All they are doing is taxing the white man into penury to support this mass of non-producers.</p>
<p>What each African state needs is a President like Thabo Mbeki and a his minister of health Msimang who&rsquo;s stance on aids/HIV resulted in the deaths of about 5 million black South Africans in the last 20 years</p>
<p>If the west really wants to help Africa then all their aid must be channelled into education only so that Africa can learn to take care of itself. No more food, clean water and health care aid. This is solving nothing and only increases the scale of the problem to the final loss of wildlife as other readers have pointed out.    </p>

I also think that the early missionaries to Africa, correct me if I am wrong, taught Christianity, namely Catholicism, which taught to be fruitful and multiply and to never use contraception and those teachings stuck. Coupled with Western aid, the population exploded.</p>
<p><br>
I grew up Catholic and do not recall ever being taught to be fruitful and multiply. It comes natural. You know how it goes. I have to laugh, really, the population explosion among blacks due to Catholic teachings. It was in the sixties that the &#8220;Pill&#8221; hit the scene. </p>
<p>quote from #47<br>
I had to laugh at both of you and your responses. It IS the men and women in those countries that are very promiscuous, have many sexual partners, unprotected sex, and could care less if they keep having babies! </p>
<p><br>
Not that the men and women of this society are not also very promiscuous, they manage to keep having many babies though.  </p>

Your post did not unduly depress me. It is worse than you think. It is made worse by the fact that most people have no idea where their food comes from (Safeway or Wal Mart). <br>
Since there is so little interest in food production, though everybody wants to eat everyday, it has escaped people&rsquo;s notice that modern agricultural practices have systematically destroyed farmland. There is little natural fertility left. In my neck of the world none.  Unless you apply petroleum based fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides you will grow nothing but stunted little corn plants, about as high as my knee, and lots of noxious weeds. That is the reality.  Big machinery is needed, that of course runs on petroleum based fuels. Without oil you have unproductive and desolate fields, a clueless population that somehow accepted long ago that growing food was for dumb yokels, and now we have agrar industry. Food production in the hands of a few.  <br>
So once they start getting hungry and think about digging up their front and back yards,after their riding mowers do not run,  how long do you think it takes to build up soil so it will grow produce?  I am not even thinking of Africa, it will be mayham in this country. Basically, what we have been doing in food production is to saw off the branch we are still sitting on. It will hit the Africans hard,of course,  and there is nothing I can do about it. Rhodesia had no lack of food stuffs. Give all the blacks a  plot and a planting stick so the women can grow some millet. <br>
First famine, then in it&rsquo;s wake disease. Use your imagination, more than likely it will be lacking. <br>
Somebody here and there growing a garden is laughable. You think they are going to let you eat your stash in peace and quiet while the city folk are starving? </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad for few reasons, but it most likely won&rsquo;t be pretty either.</p>
<p>For one thing, Peak Oil doesn&rsquo;t mean running out, it means the point when the oil production peaks. It&rsquo;s kind of difficult to estimate how far off that point is, but 10-15 years is probably optimistic, and we&rsquo;re probably already near the point when total demand encounters maximum production (even if refinery capacity etc. effects this as much as pumping of crude). At that point, prices will start rising inexorably, and the lack of spare capacity makes the system more vulnerable to any shocks, making price spikes larger and more frequent. There are, however, reasons to suspect that the downwards curve will be less steep than the upwards one. There are alternatives such as oil shale (and the efficiency of coal-to-oil Fischer-Tropsch synthesis could no doubt be improved). There are relatively unexploited reserves in areas where drilling has been too expensive (such as deeper seas or Siberia). There are also numerous experimental methods, which may or may not play a large part in the future, but will undoubtedly help some.</p>
<p>Now, how vulnerable nations will be to rising oil prices and price shocks? Here&rsquo;s a list of some nations arranged by the consumption of oil for GDP:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/sqaBB" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/sqaBB</a></p>
<p>It lacks many nations, most notably USA, but you can still see the general trend. Those nations who have to use least of oil to create GDP are either extremely poor ones, or the wealthiest ones. Due to its scattered suburban habitation, relatively low population density and road-based transportation network, USA is somewhat worse than most Europe, but not by all that much. In addition to this, the wealthiest nations use the smallest portion of their income in food, and not insignificant part of that goes to luxury foods.</p>
<p>The West and some of East Asia has a good chance of pulling off a transition into economy that is both less dependent on hydrocarbons, and can manufacture what it needs from largely renewable sources. Most of the world, however, has less resources, even less social stability, but more dependence on oil and vulnerability to increases in the price of food. The results will absolutely not be pretty, even in the best case scenario. A place like China may make it, being at least aware of the problem and working like devil to improve its position on all four factors, but most others&hellip; Expect huge or downright gigantic migrations of people fleeing war, famine and epidemics.</p>
<p>It may be that things may come to the point when the ship is sinking and our lifeboats, already crowded, are assailed by hundreds upon hundreds of desperate people trying to climb onboard. At that point, I think I&rsquo;d concur with a certain Deep Green philosopher from these parts - the most responsible and humane choice is to pick up the axe and hack off the hands clinging to the boat, lest all will drown. If someone starts to scream about it, then why, I just might (accidentally of course) knock him out with the haft.</p>

		<p>If we feed them, they will breed. Kenya is a typical african country. 1 million people in 1900.  40 million today due entirely to Whites feeding them.</p>
<p>Without western aid, african populations will fall to the level at which they can sustain themselves by themselves.</p>
<p>But we and both the christian churches, the commie athiest do gooders and our goverments will feed them.  They will invade Europe by the millions.  The lutherans, commie liberals and others will put them on planes for America.</p>
<p>Camp of the Saints is here.  It will get worse.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The only problem that could arise is that males eating the birth control laced food would start developing female sex characteristics&#8221;</p>
<p>That would be the best thing ever.  It is called chemical castration.  Massive doses of progesterone and other false pregnancy hormones overwhelm the testosterone.</p>
<p>So they calm down and stop going on insane murderous rampages.  They will get fat.  They will lose interest in sex.</p>
<p>Add rogaine to the contraceptive food and African men will become civilized eunuchs.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t fruitful and multiply in the Jewish part of the bible? </p>
<p>Does anyone think that even catholic africans obey any catholic teachings about anything?  Most africans are not catholic.  In heavily catholic nigeria the muslims are driving out the catholics.</p>
<p>When I worked in Uganda most of the Ugandian men I worked with were catholic and had 2 or 3 wives.  When anyone mentioned that polygamy is forbidden to catholics, they would laugh and say<br>
&#8220;I&rsquo;m african first, catholic second.&#8221;  Of course they supported their wives and children.</p>
<p>Africans, indians and S. american indians pay no attention to catholic teachings about abortion and contraception. Why should muslims, hindus, pagans and protestants pay attention to the catholic church&rsquo;s forbidding contraception?</p>
<p>European and N. American catholics, don&rsquo;t, why should third world non catholics obey catholic teachings about contraceptives?</p>
<p>One of the most catholc chauvinist societies on earth, the catholic french canadians have just about the lowest birth rate in N. America. I doubt they are celibate.<br>

<p>I heard yesterday on Christian radio that Ruth Bader Ginsburg said at one time that she believed in abortion of the genetically inferior races. The host went absolutely ballistic, of course. They denounced this &#8220;evil racism&#8221;, then went on to talk about all the black abortions and how we have to stop it from happening. Nary a word about all the White abortions over the years. These are today&rsquo;s typical White Christians wringing their hands again over White racism and how it has to stop.</p>
<p>I am beginning to see where Margaret Sanger may have been right and the teachings of these White Christian churches of today, are wrong. This is one reason I will not give a dime to any of these churches for their &#8220;charity&#8221; outreach.</p>

		<p>Only one other NT passage can be cited to support universal charity, Matthew 25.31-46. This is generally misread as disapproval of anyone who fails to treat all the sick, hungry, migrants and convicts in the world with undiscriminating kindness. In fact, it condemns those who fail to treat charitably the &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; of Jesus, i.e. Christians. It threatens judgement on their persecutors, and is &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo; in two additional respects: it recognises &ldquo;nations&rdquo; and believes in Hell.<br>

		<p>If only we could get serious, continuous discussion like this in the main media. </p>
<p>In Britain, it seems almost impossible. The &#8220;right-wing&#8221; weekly The Spectator (29 October) editorially pooh-poohed fears<br>
of an overcrowded planet, as follows: &#8220;Extrapolate the UN&rsquo;s medium case estimates and you find that the world population will peak (at ten billion) by the end of this century.  Then the decline starts, with the world&rsquo;s supply of Americans running out in December 2400, and the last Frenchman keeling over in January 2501.  The Irish&hellip;will go the way of the dodo long before any of us&hellip;. The more people we have, the more likely we are to resolve seemingly insurmountable population problems. That&rsquo;s why the arrival of the world&rsquo;s seven billionth human should be, like the birth of any child, a cause for celebration.&#8221;<br>
  The fact that the scientifically innovative white nations constitute a rapidly diminishing portion of the global total, and on data cited face eventual extinction, may not have fully registered with the scribbler of this arr(og)ant nonsense, although to deplore this ethnic population disparity in the UK press today could, if reported by anyone to the police as a &#8220;racist incident&#8221;, would (believe or not)trigger investigation by the strong arm of the &#8220;law&#8221;. It is also technically unlawful to possess &#8220;racist&#8221; literature in one&rsquo;s own home, if likely to be shown or communicated to another person. Yes, dear American friends, it is that bad.</p>

		<p>On balance, there would be a degree of mitigation, if polygamy<br>
were encouraged rather than discourages inasmuch as the central<br>
tendency is for abler, wealthier, healthier males to have more<br>
than one concurrent wife and &#8220;loser&#8221; males to go without a mate.<br>

		<p>Belushi said it right: &#8220;Donuts&hellip; little chocolate donuts.&#8221; What he didn&rsquo;t say was: &#8220;Little chocolate donuts that once eaten would humanely sterilize the eater.&#8221; You want food? You tacitly agree to sterilization. Its a simple as that. That is your new social contract. Don&rsquo;t for a minute think a white-controlled food network won&rsquo;t eventually do the right thing. Do you think human nature changes? It changes with circumstances to a point, which is why Charlemagne and Charles Martel would slap Bill Clinton, Bush, Sarkozy and probably you and I silly. But it is also why they might also have made their mistakes. Conversely, right now, latent in each one of us, is a Charles Martel. Sit at home and wait, because you have a home. But when it is taken away by errant policy or errant marauders, Charles comes home.</p>
