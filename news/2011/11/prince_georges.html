			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ovetta Wiggins et al., Washington Post, October 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>From Loudoun to Fairfax to Montgomery, communities that are growing are also growing more integrated, with people of every race and ethnicity living side by side. Prince George&rsquo;s stands virtually alone as a place that is gaining population yet has an increasing number of residents living in neighborhoods that are overwhelmingly one race  &mdash;  in this case, African American.</p>
<p>A Washington Post analysis of census data shows that the number of Prince George&rsquo;s neighborhoods where more than 85 percent of residents are the same race or ethnicity  &mdash;  what demographers consider a high level of segregation  &mdash;  has inched up, from 25 percent in 1990 to 27 percent last year.</p>
<p>Though the increase is small, any uptick is startling in comparison with everywhere else in the region. While the all-white neighborhood has all but disappeared from Northern Virginia, Montgomery and the District, the all-black neighborhood is on the rise in Prince George&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four factors are driving the changes in Prince George&rsquo;s: It remains a beacon for middle-class African Americans who want to live around other blacks. It continues to lose non-Hispanic whites, and few whites are moving in. It has been less successful than neighboring counties in attracting Asians. And its fastest-growing group, Hispanics, are carving out enclaves of their own instead of dispersing throughout the county.</p>
<p>The result has been a dramatic shift in the nature of segregation in Prince George&rsquo;s. Twenty years ago, fully a third of the county&rsquo;s segregated neighborhoods were white. Today, none are. And there are only a few communities where whites are a majority, mostly in College Park.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, integration has moved beyond black and white. Integrated neighborhoods often are created when Asians and Hispanics move into predominantly white neighborhoods, said John Logan, a Brown University sociologist who has studied segregation patterns for 30 years. He says these &#8220;global neighborhoods&#8221; pave the way for more blacks to move into a community without triggering white flight.</p>
<p>In the Washington region, 90 percent of whites still live in neighborhoods where they are a majority or the largest group. Many whites remain unwilling to buy houses in black neighborhoods, Logan said, and so are most Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s going to be a long, long time before that disappears,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of white people don&rsquo;t want to live around black people. It&rsquo;s crazy, I know,&#8221; said John Petro, a developer who lives in a predominantly black subdivision in Bowie and has no intention of moving away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t always say &#8216;black,&rsquo; &#8221; said Jane Eagen Dodd, a retired schoolteacher who lives in an Upper Marlboro community with a rich mix of people from different backgrounds. &#8220;They say, &#8216;The county is changing.&rsquo; &#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the county&rsquo;s white population dropped by 50,000. At the same time, the county gained 72,000 Hispanics. There are now more Hispanics than whites in Prince George&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Hispanics, who were responsible for most of the county&rsquo;s growth over the past decade, are not moving into areas that are majority black. Instead, they are clustered almost entirely in the neighborhoods around Langley Park and Beltsville. Langley Park is the only neighborhood in the county where more than 85 percent of the residents are Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Asians &#8220;would rather come here to visit than live here,&#8221; said Gayatri Varma, an immigrant from India who works at the University of Maryland and lives in Beltsville.</p>
<p>Many Asians buy houses elsewhere, Varma and others said, because they are looking for the best public schools. The Prince George&rsquo;s schools rank among the lowest in the state in test scores, though they have been improving in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scholars of the black middle class say many African Americans want to live together.</p>
<p>&#8220;They enjoy interacting with other blacks,&#8221; Karyn Lacy, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, wrote in her book &#8220;Blue-Chip Black,&#8221; for which she interviewed dozens of parents in Prince George&rsquo;s. &#8220;Scholars have focused so much on the burden of blackness that they have devoted scant attention to the possibility that there is something enjoyable about being black and participating in a community of blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residential integration is not a goal, particularly for younger black professionals born after the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s, said Bart Landry, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who has returned to Prince George&rsquo;s for an update to his 1987 book, &#8220;The New Black Middle Class.&#8221; He said many residents find comfort, after spending the day in a predominantly white workplace, in returning to a home where all their neighbors are other African American professionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re where they want to be,&#8221; Landry said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not thinking about integration. It&rsquo;s not on their radar screen. . . . Their goal is to live in a community of like-minded, like-valued people, and these are other middle-class blacks.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If the last 3 paragraphs of this article were applied to Whites, those writers would have their heads ripped off by the MSM. It&rsquo;s infurating to see when blacks want to segregate themselves, it somehow becomes perfectly understandable and acceptable, but how dare White people feel and behave the same way. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if those &#8220;new middle class blacks&#8221; can see the irony that just perhaps those that were opposed to integration back in the 60&rsquo;s just might have had the right idea after all?<br>

		<p>Blacks behave very differently if they are a large percentage or the majority. There is a tipping point somewhere.When that tipping point is reached,Whitey takes a hike.It has happened everywhere there are high percentages of blacks anywhere in the US,and elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Notice that when Blacks choose to live among Blacks, there is no condemnation. They are not called racists or bigots like Whites are who choose to live among their own kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t always say &lsquo;black,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Jane Eagen Dodd, a retired schoolteacher who lives in an Upper Marlboro community with a rich mix of people from different backgrounds. &ldquo;They say, &lsquo;The county is changing.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we can&rsquo;t come out and say that we want to live among our own kind. That would be racist of us Whites, right? We must always seek integration unlike Blacks and Hispanics who are allowed to seek segregation.</p>
<p>The tone of the article is so anti-white and pro-nonwhite that it is truly sickening.<br>

		<p>Notice how negative they make it sound when Whites choose to live among Whites - <br>
*Many whites remain unwilling to buy houses in black neighborhoods,- &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a long, long time before that disappears,&rdquo;- &ldquo;A lot of white people don&rsquo;t want to live around black people. It&rsquo;s crazy, I know,&rdquo;- &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t always say &lsquo;black,&rsquo; &rdquo;- &ldquo;They say, &lsquo;The county is changing.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>Now compare that to the way they put a positive spin about blacks that choose to live among blacks -<br>
 *Scholars of the black middle class say many African Americans want to live together - &ldquo;They enjoy interacting with other blacks,&rdquo; - they have devoted scant attention to the possibility that there is something enjoyable about being black and participating in a community of blacks.&rdquo;- He said many residents find comfort, after spending the day in a predominantly white workplace, in returning to a home where all their neighbors are other African American professionals - &ldquo;They&rsquo;re where they want to be,&rdquo;- &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not thinking about integration.

<p>Also notice how they say &#8220;after spending the day in a predominantly White workplace&#8221;, like its a great burden to them, yet who do they always expect to create jobs for them - thats right, those evil racisss White folks! What they fail to realize is that its those &#8220;burdensom&#8221; White workplaces that make everything they have possible, their &#8220;brothas&#8221; certainly aren&rsquo;t creating any jobs for them.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure those &#8220;burdensom&#8221; Whites would love to excape to a White neighborhood after spending their day working alongside hateful racist blacks, but thats becoming less and less possible for us anymore!  </p>

		<p>This is alot of hocus pocus double talk, if I might say. The all-White neighborhoods are disappearing because of forced integration. The all-black neighborhoods are much more common because of voluntary separation. It&rsquo;s simple math and common sense social norms. If White areas were allowed to remain overwhelmingly White, there would be no need for &#8220;careers&#8221; like these people currently have. That is the hallmark reason why the disintegration by integration plan has been allowed to go on for fifty plus years by liberals, and as of the last twenty, so-called &#8220;compassionate conservatives.&#8221; </p>

<p>That could be true, but I don&rsquo;t think that explains why blacks self-segregate.  I feel that the reason is economic.  Blacks who can afford to move to white neighborhoods will do so, because it goes without saying that whites know how to create and maintain desirable communities.  Blacks who can&rsquo;t afford to will either stay put or move to neighborhoods that they can afford, most likely the black neighborhoods&hellip;not necessarily because they &#8220;enjoy interacting around other blacks&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s PC, feel-good drivel.  If that were true, then more blacks would be escaping to Detroit en masse. </p>

		<p>The writer Thomas Wolfe once wrote &#8220;You can&rsquo;t go home again.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s true for me.  When my family moved to Seabrook in Prince George&rsquo;s County in 1969 the town was 98 % white and the county was about 80 % white. But Prince George&rsquo;s County was blessed with school busing in 1973 and the whites began to pack up.  Unruly blacks created chaos and mayhem in the schools at first and expanded their reach to every neighborhood in the county as they expanded eastward from the District line.  By the 1980s the collapse of white PG County became a torrent of white flight.  What had been a pleasant place to live became a reservoir of barbarism.</p>
<p>It is often countered that many black Prince George&rsquo;s County neighborhoods are affluent and the median income of many neighborhoods hovers around $ 100,000.  How is this?  Many citizens of Prince George&rsquo;s County work for some level of government- federal, state, county, Postal.  Think of a fictional black in-tact family.  Mom works as a school teacher at DuVal High School while Dad has worked 25 years in the Post Office.  The two make well over $ 100,000 annually and can afford the house in Mitchellville, Kettering, Bowie or Seabrook.  </p>
<p>Black reliance on government employment is the basis of black prosperity in Prince George&rsquo;s County. That is why Barack Obama and the Democratic Party fight so hard to prevent cuts to spending. </p>

The insanity is that whites see nothing wrong with; indeed, will joyously report the blacks&rsquo; logical desire to segregate themselves: &lsquo;They enjoy interacting with other blacks&rsquo;, while being aghast at whites&rsquo; desire to do the same, which is in their view, clearly wrong, racist and should be forbidden. Equal rights? Hardly.</b></p>
<p>&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t always say black; they say the neighborbood his changing&rsquo;. It IS changing - and that&rsquo;s the limit to what we&rsquo;re legally permitted to say.</p>
<p>And if the majority of whites continue to sit around with their thumb up their rear ends looking for a &#8216;person of color&rsquo; to say what they&rsquo;re too afraid to say, it will be too late to even say anything on the matter.  What will it take for the majority of whites to wake up and get a racial backbone?  When will it happen?</p>
