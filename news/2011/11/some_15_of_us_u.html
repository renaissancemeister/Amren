			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phil Izzo, Wall Street Journal, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nearly 15% of the U.S. population relied on food stamps in August, as the number of recipients hit 45.8 million.</p>
<p>Food stamp rolls have risen 8.1% in the past year, the Department of Agriculture reported, though the pace of growth has slowed from the depths of the recession.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mississippi reported the largest share of its population relying on food stamps, more than 21%. One in five residents in New Mexico, Tennessee, Oregon and Louisiana also were food stamp recipients.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>States also made changes to make it easier for residents to tap into the program, such as waiving requirements that limited the value of assets food stamp recipients could own.</p>

<p>Politico complains about food stamp cuts at a time when food prices are rising.</p>
<p>That might help to bring food prices down, because it will marginally decrease demand for food.</p>

		<p>And how much of that growth is from mexicans?  How much of it is from fraud where a person gets them under multiple phony aliases and then sells them for drug money.</p>
<p>All one has to do is look over the southern border to the tremendous wealth and power of the drug lords to understand that American welfare, for the most part, is being diverted into the drug trade.</p>
<p>Despite the OBVIOUS problem, not only is nothing being done to keep this from happening but liberal bastions are pretending to be sanctuary cities knowing full well that the behaviors they don&rsquo;t engage in to avoid asking about citizenship allow massive fraud.</p>

		<p>I have gone through a series of personal &#8220;calamities&#8221; that would render your basic welfare recipient a driveling ball of blob begging for more hand outs! My family and I have stuck together and figured out ways to get through these &#8220;hard times.&#8221; It&rsquo;s amazing how you can maintain &#8220;hope&#8221; in spite of the failed &#8220;Obama&#8221; HOPE!

<p>It is said that there is a secondary market in food stamps but how much does the vendor lose on the official price / the cover price?</p>
<p>If I own $100 in food stamps and sell them to buy crack, do I get $90 or $30?</p>
<p>Are there any forged food stamps in circulation?</p>

The idea that you say that either means two things. Someone in your family has money to help you. Or more likely you haven&rsquo;t been tested yet with real tragedy.</p>
<p>I had a similar attitude as you until I had a REAL tragedy. I only have a brother who has had his own bad luck.I sincerely hope you do not reach the point where you will be happy there is a safety net. As ten of millions of Whites every year are. Partly because of our Plutocratic criminal system. The idea that you call it Obama&rsquo;s food stamp nation tells me you are CONservative. Well too bad because you cannot be a CONservative and a WN at the time. You are trying to conserve this system. I am for revolutionary change as all WN are.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the New Global Economy. Corporations benefit by moving jobs overseas and maintaining a take-it-or-leave-it attitude toward paying a living wage. So, more people become dependent on food stamps and such to supplement the non-living wages, and the government becomes a kind of subsidy for the corporations.</p>
<p>There are Occupy Wall Street folks who get this, but most of them wouldn&rsquo;t be able to articulate it. Of course, there are also the dead weight blacks and hispanics who suck off of the system in good times or bad, and the Oakland type of Occupiers who just think whitey owes them more and that the best way to get it is to destroy things.</p>

		<p>The Wall Street Journal is just another bulletin board for the GOP Spin Machine. This article is only meant to make people think it&rsquo;s all Obama&rsquo;s fault, blah blah, and only the noble, fiscally-conservative and wise Republicans will save us.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal seems to just love Free-Trade Agreements and Open Borders, too. </p>
<p>So what do they expect white working-class people who lost their jobs to do? If Obama&rsquo;s aunt from Kenya who was in the US illegally for years can live in Federal housing and receive disability money, then why can&rsquo;t us white folks use food stamps? </p>

<p>Blacks and Mexicans take up much of welfare costs. I know, I worked in that field for many years.</p>
<p> As for Indians and Filipinos, they make up a much smaller percentage of the USA, so of course you will have less of them on welfare percentage wise. </p>
<p>BUT, they use up much of our tax dollars in so many ways. Low low cost loans paid by us so they can go into business, their fraud is well known in much of our medical fields, cheating and billing medicare out of millions upon millions of dollars. How many times have we read of that here on Amren?  They bring in their elderly parents, etc. to leech off of us (SSA/SSI) without ever paying a dime into the system. The list goes on and on, so when I say &#8220;minorities&#8221; I mean NON-whites, period.</p>

<p>Feds bust 12 in $95 million Medicare fraud scheme; funds used for massages, dance lessons and facials </p>
<p>Four Queens doctors, an office manager and six others charged in Medicare fraud<br>
BY John Marzulli </p>
<p>NEW YORK DAILY NEWS </p>
<p>Wednesday, November 2 2011, 3:31 PM </p>
<p>Medicare cheats dispensed free facials, massages, food and dance lessons to &ldquo;patients,&rdquo; in exchange for their help bilking the government health care program, authorities said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The enticements were handed out at two clinics in Queens to patients who gave crooked doctors their Medicare numbers to bill the government for services they never got, an indictment unsealed in Brooklyn Federal Court alleges.</p>
<p>Hon Yon Kim, 85, a doctor who is also the president of Uri Medical Service and Sarang Medical PC in downtown Flushing, was speedily pushed past newspaper photographers in a wheelchair after he was released on $500,000 bail.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m white and I was self-employed for decades.  I had a number of misfortunes occur and have also found that no one will employ an over educated, over 50 white man.  So when I finally broke down and applied for food stamps, never had any assistance from anyone or government especially in my life, I was really humiliated.  In fact, when I had to tell the worker, who was black, what I used to do for a living, I wept.  I&rsquo;m sure she enjoyed seeing a white man fighting back tears of humiliation.  Are you happy?</p>

<p>Fraud happened when the SNAP/Food Stamps were in the form of paper coupons, and it&rsquo;s still happening with those benefits on debit cards.  The given demographic doesn&rsquo;t feel shame either way, either being on that program or engaging in fraud related to it.</p>

<p>That is the workig adults.  They almost all do work.  Their parents and grandparents are all over here with full SSI, sec 8 senior housing, food stamps, medical care, free senior transportation.  Realize that people over 60 are the ones who need the most medical care.</p>
<p>The highest social security for those who have worked from age 18 to 67 on social security is about $1,600 per month.  If you have never worked a day under social security you can get about $900 per month.</p>
<p>If the fillipino, asian and indian elders live with their relatives, a married couple brings in $1,800 per month, a hefty contribution to the household.</p>

		<p>It is now law in about 35 states, that you do NOT have to document your &#8216;situation.&rsquo;  That means that you can flat out lie to the interviewer about what is really going on and how much money you make.  I used to work for DHS in downtown Ft. Worth and by far most of my clients were black. (Many with Coach/Dooney Burke bags and acrylic nails that were so popular at the time.)  This was in the 90&rsquo;s before the Mexican influx.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #17, I am so sorry that happened to you.</p>
<p>My boyfriend, when he was in the U.S. Army, applied for food stamps when he came back from the Persian Gulf War.  He did so because his young wife and child were in need as was he (he was only 20 and his wife was 19 and they had a two year old child).  He was turned down, they told him, because he had a car worth $3,000.  I understand they used to take &#8220;assets&#8221; into account.  But I really think they turned him down because he was white.</p>
<p>After that, he had to take two jobs to make ends meet.  Tell me, how is it okay for a white man to have to take two jobs after serving his country and sacrificing a family life then and even after he returned home, when it&rsquo;s also okay for a black man or woman to have NO job and get assistance just because they are a certain color?</p>
<p>I have another friend who is disabled.  She cannot get any assistance although she has applied many times.  Why?  Take a guess.  She was actually TOLD she couldn&rsquo;t qualify because of her color.  And what can she do about it?  Not a DAMN THING.</p>

		<p>They still sell the cards. Usually for half the value. And the cards are sold to Muslim convenience store owners, who in turn use them at bigger National chains to stock their shelves, or sometimes claimimg the full amount. That how they are getting caught however, so just using them to buy stuff at a National chain is smarter. The original recipient just reports it lost before the next month. This is why the costs have shot up so much. Government won&rsquo;t penalize the recipient, and adds the amount &#8220;lost&rsquo; to the next month&rsquo;s card&hellip; Thus people with a couple grand on their cards&hellip; And I am a cashier at the big national chain, so I know. Reporting it does NOTHING.</p>

		<p>Why should any White American Citizen feel ashamed for having to apply for Food Stamps, Medicade, HEAP, and Welfare? You worked and paid taxes that supported the System for years. You never took a dime from a System that took money out of your paycheck in taxes, to feed and house the lazy blacks and browns.</p>
<p>Unlike you, the blacks and browns make a living at being on Public Assistance, then sign their kids up, normally all eight or more of them, and then they go on Welfare, etc., for life. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a generational thing, now five or six generations, as they procreate, since the Great Society scam was played on us in the 1960s.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s your turn to collect, for what you paid into, and if you are out of work, thanks to NAFTA, CAFTA, FTAA, and GATT, then sit back and wait for your checks to come in. Screw them. </p>

		<p>Though I detest it, there are occasions where I have to buy a few things at China-Mart. I always patronize the few white cashiers, of course, and we often get in hooded conversations about the EBT abuse perpetrated by &#8216;those who are not our color&rsquo;. To a person they are absolutely livid about the practices of these non-whites they see on a daily basis blatantly &amp; criminally violating the so-called &#8216;rules&rsquo;of using food stamps. Though it is required by law, employees are specifically told by China-Mart they are NOT to ask for a customer&rsquo;s ID when they use EBT, even when they see the customer use an EBT and then hand it off to the person behind them in line to use. One told me of a Mexican couple with 5 children who bought $350 worth of groceries, and after ringing it up the cashier noticed they still had over $800 left in their EBT account. She was as angry about it as I am, and asked me,&#8221;If they still had over $800 left, just how much do they GET for 5 children?? I don&rsquo;t get a dime, and after this job and paying taxes they actually make more money than I do in a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>One cashier told me something I, in my little &#8216;follow the rules&rsquo; world, hadn&rsquo;t really thought of: EBT should be used ONLY for staples, such as milk, bread, peanut butter, flour, sugar, fresh fruits and vegetables, cheese, basic meats, etc., - the things one needs to survive. The things real meals are made with from scratch. Period. No prepared sweets, junk food, sodas, rib eye steaks, etc. It is designed to keep you from starving; not to feed you like a wealthy land baron. WIC is more in line with the types of things people should be allowed to buy on food stamps, though WIC is also totally abused and instead of being used as a crutch on the way up, is used as a way of life. </p>
<p>Once again, the inmates are running the asylum.</p>

		<p>&#8221; One told me of a Mexican couple with 5 children who bought $350 worth of groceries, and after ringing it up the cashier noticed they still had over $800 left in their EBT account. &#8220;</p>
<p>Depending on the state and age of kids, they would get from $750 to $900 per month.   They might have more than 5 kids.  The kids under 5 entitle the family to WIC coupons, $100 per month per kid.  The under 5&rsquo;s get food stamps and WIC coupons.  </p>
<p>During the school year, the school age kids get breakfast, lunch and after school snack at school.  Kids in free day care get the same amount of food.  During summer, the do gooders give hispanic kids free bag breakfast, lunch and snacks in the parks.</p>
<p>7 people, 21 meals per week is 147 meals per week. If 5 kids get 2 meals a day at school that means the parents only have to serve 97 meals per week at home.  Since so many hispanics work in restaurants or as maids and care takers, the parents often have one meal a day provided by employer. Probably non one eats lunch at home during the week.</p>
<p>They may use less food stamps than provided every month because of the free food the kids get at school.  Food stamps roll over like cell phone minutes.  So if they have $50 left over each month it adds up.</p>
<p>A common scam is to get food stamps for every kid even if the kids live in mexico.  That is illegal, but the food stamp people never check.  All the parents need is the mexican birth certificate.  If they don&rsquo;t have kids in mexico, they can always send money to a relative and the relative will buy a phoney certificate.</p>
<p>Then they can go to the food stamp office and claim any number of kids.</p>
<p>Food stamps are an evil White program to cause obesity and its attendant health problems in blacks and hispanics.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hon Yon Kim, 85, a doctor who is also the president of Uri Medical Service and Sarang Medical PC in downtown Flushing, was speedily pushed past newspaper photographers in a wheelchair after he was released on $500,000 bail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember that asian applicants for US medical schools are given preference over Whites.  In California med schools, there are almost no White American men and not that many White women.  Working in a university with a medical school, I have often wondered if they go to medical school so they can get in on medical fraud.<br>

<p>&#8220;I have another friend who is disabled. She cannot get any assistance although she has applied many times. Why? Take a guess. She was actually TOLD she couldn&rsquo;t qualify because of her color. And what can she do about it? Not a DAMN THING.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sincerely concerned, has your friend contacted a disability attorney?  There are a lot of them in the cities.  They can usually get the disability.  <br>

		<p>Many elderly Asians in this part of town are driving luxury vehicles, BWMs, Mercedes, etc. Most speak little or no English, so I doubt the earned that money making a living in this country. I have no idea where their money comes from as many are what you might call fresh of the boat types. I&rsquo;m quite certain in the not to distant past, many of these elders were squatting in rice paddies. Isn&rsquo;t America wonderful!</p>

They still sell the cards. Usually for half the value. And the cards are sold to Muslim convenience store owners, who in turn use them at bigger National chains to stock their shelves, or sometimes claimimg the full amount. That how they are getting caught however, so just using them to buy stuff at a National chain is smarter. The original recipient just reports it lost before the next month. This is why the costs have shot up so much. Government won&rsquo;t penalize the recipient, and adds the amount &ldquo;lost&rsquo; to the next month&rsquo;s card&hellip; Thus people with a couple grand on their cards&hellip; And I am a cashier at the big national chain, so I know. Reporting it does NOTHING.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
This means the goverment is totally complicit with the cheating by both the immigrant convenience store owners and the blacks and hispanics who sell the cards to them.</p>
<p>When credit cards are reported lost or stolen they are immediately cut off.  When EBT cards are reported lost or stolen they should be immediately cut off.  The cards should not be able to be used after the report is made.  If the report is made after the card is used, the amount spent should be deducted from the amount rolled over to the next month.</p>
<p>I doubt this is just the immigrant welfare workers helping their own people although this is a part of it.  The Department of Agriculture must be complicit in this.</p>
<p>Those EBT cards were supposed to them selling the stamps to immigrant store owners.  So now they just buy their stock with the cards they bought for 30 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p><br>
My Armenian boss once told me that no matter how we Americans try, we won&rsquo;t be able to cope with immigrant fraud because <br>
the immigrants are so much better at fraud.  Several times he has compared America to a flock of fat chickens being invaded by wolves.</p>
