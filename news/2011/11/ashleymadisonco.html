			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, November 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>According to AshleyMadison.com, the Hispanic community is &#8220;the fastest growing community when it comes to infidelity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press release sent by the self-described &#8220;largest dating site for married people&#8221;, the company states that since launching the Spanish-language version of their website in 2009, 1.1 million Latinos have signed up, accounting for 31% of their total new membership.</p>
<p>The company further suggests that according to their data, &#8220;Hispanic members have affairs at the youngest age: Average age of 27 for women and 34 for men (compared to 33 for women and 40 for men in the general US population).&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering the stereotype of Latinos as family-oriented and with conservative social values, this may come as a bit of a surprise.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A separate finding reported by AshleyMadison.com in their press release corroborates this, somewhat, indicating that Hispanics who are cheating on their spouses &#8220;are choosing to have fewer partners: US members average three affair partners per year; Hispanic members average only one affair partner per year.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in 2009, the National Institutes of Health published a report which showed that Latino youths are less apt to protect against sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancy due to their focus &#8220;on the emotional and social repercussions of potentially revealing infidelity by advocating condom use than the physical repercussions of unsafe sex.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This should be an eye opener to the foolish Catholic hierarchy that wants to import these Indians into our America.  Non-Whites, especially Blacks, have no genetic factor inclining them to pair bonding.   But it won&rsquo;t.<br>
<p><br>
White people are the only race that has a strong monogamous tendency.  It is part of the genetic makeup that evolution produced.  In Ice Age and colder claimants strong pair bonding evolved as a successful reproductive strategy.<br>
<p><br>
The Catholic Church has been behaving kind of stupidly since Vatican II.  Its current policy is to downgrade the males, spend resources on clannish races that do not leave their wealth, if they have any, to the Church, and disown its traditional claim to uniqueness.<br>

<p>In other words &#8220;since you is my woman and I be a true Macho, therefore I can never use a condom because it is my destiny to impregnate you as often and as much as possible.  To use a condom is not macho.  If to use a condom turns me into a (A)mericon, it follows that even talking about using condoms or any kind of contraception turns me into a (A)mericon.  Which is the worse possible thing that could ever happen to a macho, like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since all the other people non-Hispanic are picking up the tab for all the little bundles-of-joy that you are sprouting everywhere to prove that you are not a maricon, it is more important to you to never use a condom rather than talk to &#8216;your&rsquo; woman about the long term consequences of your wanton impregnations.  </p>
<p>Sounds like a plan to get the peasants to make as many people in as short as time as possible.  Something that the Europeans would have thought up about 400 years ago to replenish the population after the 100 years war, which followed the 30-years-war, which followed the great civil war, which followed the permanent endless European war going back to Roman empire times.  </p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t work here in the USA in the 21st century!</p>
<p>Amigos!  If you can&rsquo;t feed them, then don&rsquo;t breed them!  &#8216;Cause if you breed &#8216;em and can&rsquo;t feed them, then all you can do is either bleed them or seed &#8216;em (send them out to El Norte).</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, endless numbers of Mestizo children.  Every single one of them supported by a check from some government agency, using funds taken out of my paycheck.  Funds that I no have to use to plan and support a small family responsibly.</p>

		<p>I have to wonder if American media saturation factors into this at all.  The media presenting an increasingly liberal attitude towards sex in a desperate attempt to sell more toilet paper and a large portion of our hispanic population is relatively new and perhaps not as skeptical about what they see on t.v.  That wouldn&rsquo;t be the only reason, but perhaps it&rsquo;s a contributing factor.  </p>

		<p>Hispanic men more loyal to their women?  Yeah, right.  They have higher incidents of beating women and there are more Hispanic &#8216;youth&rsquo; having out of wedlock children that the taxpayers will have to foot the bill for.  People say, &#8220;Those Hispanics work hard&#8221; really annoys me!  They don&rsquo;t take into consideration the Hispanics are on public assistance and can&rsquo;t pay for the healthcare visits and everyone else has to foot the bill for it.</p>

		<p>These must be the great family values George Bush told us Mexicans have. I&rsquo;m so glad that the Republican party is full of intelligent people looking out for the interests of the white race.</p>

Blacks are sexually active at an earlier age than Whites. Whites, in turn, are sexually active earlier than Orientals. Surveys from the World Health Organization show this three-way racial pattern to be true around the world&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Blacks are the most sexually active, have the most multiple births, and have the most permissive attitudes. Orientals are the least sexually active and show the least sexual fantasy and the most sexual guilt. Whites are in the middle. Sex diseases are most common in Blacks, least so in Orientals, with Whites in between the two.<br>

		<p>I am in my mid twenties and have never had a girlfriend nor experienced sexual relations with a woman. Even though I have a good, stable income and a nice place of my own, women in the US avoid me at all costs and only appear to date aloof men who use them, then complain about being used afterwards. As a result of being unwanted and totally unable to find a wife in the US, I have been examining foreign match-making agencies extensively.</p>
<p>I came across a match-making agency that pairs Western men with women from Hispanic countries. As I was browsing the thousands profiles of women featured on the site, I was utterly apalled because two thirds of them had illegitimate children and were almost always listed as single instead of divorced. I am not exaggerating. Sometimes I would see &#8220;pregnant&#8221; selected for the children section (as if any man in his right mind would willingly marry a woman carrying a brood parasite). The age of the children was also listed. I subtracted the age of the children from the age of the woman, and many times the woman with illegitimate children would have spawned her first brood at 13 years of age.</p>
<p>I never returned to that site.</p>
<p>Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of Darwin can figure out the evolutionary strategy these immoral Hispanic women were using: they are spawning brood parasites with men they think are higher on the evolutionary latter, then expecting a lowly beta boy to provide for their illegitimate offspring. This sort of primitive, animalistic behavior seems to characterize most Hispanic women whether they are in their own countries or in the US. Just go to a mall or shopping center in the US where there is a heavy Hispanic population and witness all of the teen Hispanic girls with their little muchachos and absent babydaddy.</p>
<p>I am an atheist for many reasons: the absence of evidence for any god or gods; the fact that endless amounts of violence, suffering and evil exists; and various other reasons that other atheists state for being atheists. There are some things that reinforce my atheism. One in particular is the prevalent immorality of Christianity&rsquo;s adherents, especially among Hispanics. Consider the punishment for sexual relations outside of marriage is very severe in both the Old and New Testaments (source: Deuteronomy 22:21-20 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10). If being a Christian saves people from sin and gives them the mind of Christ so to speak, why would there be all of these Hispanic women and teens, most of whom identify heavily with Catholicism, who engage in so much immorality and spawn so many illegitimate children?</p>
<p>Although cuckoldry can happen to anyone regardless of the race of his wife, there is a much greater probability that a man who marries an Hispanic woman will result in a brood parasite. A statistic that I saw on wikipedia (it has since been removed, probably because some idiot didn&rsquo;t like seeing evidence that black and Hispanic women were much more likely to spawn brood parasites than white and Asian women) is that 10% to 11% of Hispanic men with Hispanic wives are raising children who aren&rsquo;t their own as a result of the woman&rsquo;s adultery. The statistic for white men with white wives is 1% to 2%. So for anyone who is in my position and needs to marry a wife from abroad due to American women always saying they are willing to date stable, decent men but whose actions clearly show otherwise, avoid contact with women from Hispanic countries at all costs.</p>

<p>That is not correct it is about 15% for white, and I believe was 38* for blacks.</p>
