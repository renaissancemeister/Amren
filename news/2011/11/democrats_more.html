<h1><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150611/Democrats-Liberal-Less-White-2008.aspx">Democrats More Liberal, Less White Than in 2008</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Newport et al., Gallup, November 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In many respects, the demographic profile of Democrats nationwide is similar to what it was in 2008, although Democrats have become somewhat less white and more liberal than the party that nominated Barack Obama as its presidential candidate that year. As a group, Democrats are more likely than average to be women and nonwhite, less likely to be religious or married, much less likely to be conservative, and much more likely to be liberal than the U.S. population as a whole.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For this analysis, the Democratic population is defined as those who either identify as Democrats or who identify as independents but say they lean toward the Democratic Party. Between the start of 2008 and today, the percentage of Americans identifying as Democrats or leaning Democratic has fallen from 50% to 43%. The percentage identifying as Republicans has risen from 37% to 40%, while the percentage of &#8220;pure&#8221; independents who do not lean toward either party has gone from 12% to 15%. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>2. The racial and ethnic composition of the Democratic Party has also changed slightly. The proportion of Democrats who identify their race as black grew by three percentage points, from 16% to 19%, over the last three years, while the proportion that is white (non-Hispanic) fell by three points, from 66% to 63%. This contrasts with a smaller one-point increase in blacks and two-point decrease in whites nationally.</p>
<p>The percentage of Democrats who are Hispanic rose by two percentage points, from 12% to 14%, identical to the increase among all Americans.</p>

		<p>you think white women hate white men more than black women blac men? I think you are taking small group and spread it on everyone&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s a tragedy that whites make 63% of Democrats&hellip;what are theese people thinking&hellip;or they are not&hellip;white people need to gather around one party and stand united&hellip;this is only chance&hellip;if healthy 70 or so percent of whites unite in the same party there is good perspective in the future&hellip;no matter what happens&hellip;</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s use an analogy.</p>
<p>Think of the Democratic party as a neighborhood. <br>
Blacks move in. Whites move out. </p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<p>As White liberals gravitate towards the GOP, they bring their multiculturalist world view with them. </p>

		<p>Wait until those ultra-Liberal White Politicians can&rsquo;t get the black-brown vote for Dog Catcher. Then they will realize how they cut their own throats. </p>

<p>No, you are not &#8220;White&#8221;. Any brown or black pigment makes you nonwhite. I am glad Obama thinks he is black, because he is. </p>
