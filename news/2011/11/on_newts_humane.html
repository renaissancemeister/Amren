<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=372337">On Newt&rsquo;s &#8216;Humane&rsquo; Immigration Policy</a></h1></div><p>Thomas Sowell, World Net Daily, November 28, 2011</p></div><p>Now that Newt Gingrich has become the latest in a series of Republican front-runners, he is getting the kinds of scrutiny and attacks that have done in other front-runners.</p><p>One of the issues that has aroused concern among conservative Republicans is that of amnesty for illegal immigrants, especially after Gingrich said that it would not be &#8220;humane&#8221; to deport someone who has been living and working here for years.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s go back to square one. The purpose of American immigration laws and policies is not to be either humane or inhumane to illegal immigrants. The purpose of immigration laws and policies is to serve the national interest of this country.</p><p>There is no inherent right to come live in the United States, in disregard of whether the American people want you here. Nor does the passage of time confer any such right retroactively.</p><p>{snip}</p><p>The more doctrinaire libertarians see the benefits of free international trade in goods and extend the same reasoning to free international movement of people. But goods do not bring a culture with them. Nor do they give birth to other goods to perpetuate that culture.</p><p>Why do people want to come to America in the first place? Because America offers them something their native countries do not. This country has a culture that has produced a higher standard of living and a freer life than that of many other countries.</p><p>When you import people, you import cultures, including cultures that have been far less successful in providing decent lives and decent livelihoods. The American people have a right to decide for themselves whether they want unlimited imports of cultures from other countries.</p><p>At one time, immigrants came to America to become Americans. Today, the apostles of multiculturalism and grievance-mongering have done their best to keep foreigners foreign and, if possible, feeling aggrieved. {snip}</p><p>{snip}</p><!-- #bbinclude "footer.incl" -->
