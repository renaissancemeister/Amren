<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><span class="dropcap" style="float: left; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Georgia, serif; font-size: 4.4em; line-height: 0.85em; margin-right: 0.03em; margin-bottom: -0.25em; color: rgb(0, 0, 153); ">T</span>he October 11, 1999, cover story of&nbsp;<i>National Review</i>&nbsp;was a piece by Senior Editor Ramesh Ponnuru called &#8220;A Conservative No More,&#8221; which argued that Patrick Buchanan has abandoned conservative principles. The article complained about Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s isolationism, opposition to free trade, and support for certain government programs, but the most serious charge appeared in the subtitle: &#8220;The tribal politics of Pat Buchanan.&#8221; According to Mr. Ponnuru, &#8220;Buchananism is a form of identity politics for white people   &mdash;   and becomes more worrisome as it is married to collectivism.&#8221; Any expression of white identity is now apparently a betrayal of conservatism. It was not always so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><i>National Review</i>&nbsp;is considered the flagship publication of post-World War II conservatism. William F. Buckley started it in 1955, declaring that it &#8220;stands athwart history yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.&#8221; Mr. Buckley was yelling &#8220;stop&#8221; to the spread of communism abroad and liberalism at home. That it should now attack Mr. Buchanan for supporting protectionism and market intervention is consistent with founding principles and no surprise. But few would have thought that after 44 years of publication, a senior editor with an Indian surname would condemn a popular white conservative for speaking up for whites.</p>

The early&nbsp;<i>National Review</i>&nbsp;heaped criticism on the civil rights movement,&nbsp;<i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i>&nbsp;and people like Adam Clayton Powell and Martin Luther King, whom it considered race hustlers. Some of the greatest names in American conservatism   &mdash;   Russell Kirk, Willmore Kendall, James Kilpatrick, Richard Weaver, and a young Bill Buckley   &mdash;   wrote articles defending the white South and white South Africans in the days of segregation and apartheid. NR attacked the 1965 immigration bill that opened America up to Third-World immigration, and wrote frankly about racial differences in IQ. There were always hints of compromise, but passages from some back issues could have been lifted right out of&nbsp;<i>American Renaissance.</i>&nbsp;Not so today. NR still supports immigration reform and is not afraid of the IQ debate, but Mr. Ponnuru&rsquo;s article is just one example of its complete abandonment of the interests of whites as a group. What used to be an important part of the NR message it now dismissed as illegitimate &#8220;white identity politics.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><b>&#8216;Why the South Must Prevail&rsquo;</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">A famous example of the early NR stance on race was an unsigned editorial of August 24, 1957, titled &#8220;Why the South Must Prevail.&#8221; It was almost certainly written by Mr. Buckley, since he uses similar language in his book&nbsp;<i>Up From Liberalism.</i>&nbsp;The editorial argued against giving blacks the vote because it would undermine civilization in the South:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><p style="line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;The central question that emerges&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not prevail numerically? The sobering answer is Yes   &mdash;   the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race. It is not easy, and it is unpleasant, to adduce statistics evidencing the cultural superiority of White over Negro: but it is a fact that obtrudes, one that cannot be hidden by ever-so-busy egalitarians and anthropologists.&#8221;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;<i>National Review</i>&nbsp;believes that the South&rsquo;s premises are correct<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;It is more important for the community, anywhere in the world, to affirm and live by civilized standards, than to bow to the demands of the numerical majority.&#8221;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;The South confronts one grave moral challenge. It must not exploit the fact of Negro backwardness to preserve the Negro as a servile class<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;Let the South never permit itself to do this. So long as it is merely asserting the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races, and so long as it does so by humane and charitable means, the South is in step with civilization, as is the Congress that permits it to function.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">The final passage about &#8220;genuine cultural equality between the races&#8221; can be read either as a last-minute loss of will&nbsp;<i>or</i>&nbsp;as a description of a criterion for the black franchise that&nbsp;<i>could never be met.</i>&nbsp;In any case, the editorial recognizes a principle NR would never articulate today: the right of a civilized minority   &mdash;   racial or otherwise   &mdash;   to impose its will upon an uncivilized majority. NR Contributing Editor L. Brent Bozell dissented from the editorial on constitutional grounds but still admitted, &#8220;It is understandable that White Southerners should try to have it both ways   &mdash;   they can&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;what would happen should Negroes begin to vote, and they naturally want to cover their bet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Needless to say, even in the 1950s, when the interests of whites were more openly recognized, the editorial called down the wrath of the liberals. Prof. William Muehl of the Yale Divinity School wrote: [I]n that vicious and wholly amoral thesis you exposed again the basic savagery of the reactionary mentality at bay.&#8221; Would anything NR publishes today evoke such fury from established liberals?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">But Mr. Buckley&rsquo;s magazine stood firm. A book review from the July 13th issue of the same year   &mdash;   1957   &mdash;   by Richard Weaver was called, &#8220;Integration is Communization.&#8221; Mr. Weaver found Carl Rowan&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Go South to Sorrow</i>&nbsp;&#8220;a sorry specimen of Ne</p>
<p>gro intellectual leadership,&#8221; and went on to express deep suspicion about the whole integrationist enterprise:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><p>&#8221; &#8216;Integration&rsquo; and &#8216;Communization&rsquo; are, after all, pretty closely synonymous. In light of what is happening today, the first may be little more than a euphemism for the second. It does not take many steps to get from the &#8216;integrating&rsquo; of facilities to the &#8216;communizing&rsquo; of facilities, if the impulse is there.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">He concluded with a restatement of the principles of voluntary association. &#8220;In a free society, associations for educational, cultural, social, and business purposes have a right to protect their integrity against political fanaticism. The alternative to this is the destruction of free society and the replacement of its functions by government, which is the Marxist dream.&#8221; Government&rsquo;s current &#8220;civil rights&#8221; powers to limit freedom of association have, indeed, brought virtually every corner of our lives under bureaucratic control, but would NR dare say so today?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Likewise in 1957, Sam M. Jones interviewed segregationist Senator Richard Russell of Georgia. In a Q&A format, Mr. Jones asked, &#8220;Do the people of the South fear political domination by the Negro or miscegenation or both?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Senator Russell replied, &#8220;Both. As you know, Mr. Jones, there are some communities and some states where the Negro&rsquo;s voting potential is very great. We wish at all costs to avoid a repetition of the Reconstruction period when newly freed slaves made the laws and undertook their enforcement. We feel even more strongly about miscegenation or racial amalgamation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">&#8220;The experience of other countries and civilizations has demonstrated that the separation of the races biologically is highly preferable to amalgamation.</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><p style="line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;I know of nothing in human history that would lead us to conclude that miscegenation is desirable.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

Jones wrote another article that year criticizing integration in the Washington, D.C., public schools. Titled &#8220;Caution: Integration at Work,&#8221; he accurately predicted that &#8220;the problem of school integration in the nation&rsquo;s capital may be eventually solved by the steady migration of the white population out of the District of Columbia.&#8221; Jones criticized school integration on the grounds of IQ differences, citing &#8220;a white average ranging from 105 to 111 and a Negro average of 87 to 89. (An intelligent quotient of 85 is generally considered the minimum for receiving education.)&#8221; He went on to note:</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); "><p>&#8220;Data on juvenile delinquency&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;revealed a marked increase in truancy, theft, vandalism and sex-offenses in integrated schools. Dances and dramatic presentations have been quietly given up by most high schools. Senior and junior class plays have been discontinued. Inter-racial fights are frequent and constant vigilance is required to prevent molestation or attempted molestation of white girls by Negro boys or girls. In contrast, the schools outside the integrated neighborhoods have no more such problems than they had four years ago.&#8221; Mr. Jones concluded that &#8220;the record shows&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;that the problems of integration are extremely serious and that no solution is in sight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Defending a community&rsquo;s right to keep the peace, he wrote that &#8220;the State of Arkansas and Orval Faubus are wholly in the right; they have acted lawfully; they are entitled to those great presumptions of the law which underlie the whole of our judicial tradition.&#8221; Predicting a &#8220;storm&#8221; of white resistance he wrote, &#8220;Conceding, for the sake of discussion, that the Negro pupil has these new rights, what of the white community?&nbsp;<i>Has it none?</i>&#8220;</p>

A July 2, 1963, editorial declared: &#8220;The Negro people have been encouraged to ask for, and to believe they can get, nothing less than the evanescence of color, and they are doomed to founder on the shoals of existing human attitudes   &mdash;   their own included.&#8221; Race, as AR continues to point out, cannot be made not to matter, and NR once understood that.</p>

He wrote, &#8220;I believe this bill is a very bad bill. In my view, the means here proposed are the wrong means<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;In the name of achieving certain &#8216;rights&rsquo; for one group of citizens this bill would impose some fateful compulsions on another group of citizens.&#8221; After it passed, an editorial declared: &#8220;The Civil Rights Act has been law for only a little over two months, yet it already promises to be the source of much legalistic confusion, civic chaos and bureaucratic malpractice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Mr. Kilpatrick also took aim at the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the April 20, 1965 issue. &#8220;Must We Repeal the Constitution to Give the Negro the Vote?&#8221; he asked, accusing the bill&rsquo;s supporters of &#8220;perverting the Constitution.&#8221; He thought certain blacks should be given the right to vote but notes, &#8220;Over most of this century, the great bulk of Southern Negroes have been genuinely unqualified for the franchise.&#8221; He also defended segregation as rational for Southerners. &#8220;Segregation is a fact, and more than a fact; it is a state of mind. It lies in the Southern subconscious next to man&rsquo;s most elementary instincts, for self-preservation, for survival, for the untroubled continuation of a not intolerable way of life.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: medium; line-height: 1.1em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 255); ">Mr. Buckley softened his position on civil rights in the 1960s but to a point that would still be intolerable for conservatives today. In a column written five months before the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and called &#8220;The Issue at Selma,&#8221; he called for giving blacks the vote but perhaps restricting the franchise to high school graduates. He sympathized with the Southern position writing, &#8220;In much of the South, what is so greatly feared is irresponsible, mobocratic rule, and it is a fear not easily dissipated, because it is well-grounded that if the entire Negro population in the South were suddenly given the vote, and were to use it as a bloc, and pursuant to directives handed down by some of the more demagogic leaders, chaos would ensue.&#8221; He also warned of &#8220;a suddenly enfranchised, violently embittered Negro population which will take the vote and wield it as an instrument of vengeance, shaking down the walls of Jericho even to their foundations, and reawakening the terrible genocidal antagonisms that scarred the Southern psyche during the days of Reconstruction.&#8221;</p>

There, democracy induces harmony. Harmony (not freedom) is demo-cracy&rsquo;s finest flower. Even a politically unstable society of limited personal freedom can be harmonious if governed democratically, if only because the majority understand themselves to be living in the house that they themselves built.&#8221;</p>

They have on occasion after occasion, in almost every part of the country, called out their mobs on the streets, promoted &#8216;school strikes&rsquo; sit-ins, lie-ins, in explicit violation of the law and in explicit violation of the public authority.

The human rights of Chinese, or of Caucasians living behind the Iron Curtain never appeared to move him.&#8221; This is pretty mild criticism but it would not appear in today&rsquo;s NR, which fawns over King as much as the liberals do.</p>

In the March 9, 1965, issue Russell Kirk decried court-enforced black voting rights as &#8220;theoretical folly&#8221; that the US would nevertheless survive, but declared prophetically that the same dogma in South Africa, &#8220;if applied, would bring anarchy and the collapse of civilization.&#8221; For Kirk, civilization required apartheid: &#8220;In a time of virulent &#8216;African nationalism,&rsquo;&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;how is South Africa&rsquo;s &#8216;European&rsquo; population&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;to keep the peace and preserve a prosperity unique in the Dark Continent?&#8221; White rule, he answered, is a prudent way, &#8220;to govern tolerably a society composed of several races, among which only a minority is civilized.&#8221; He called for humane treatment of South African blacks but dismissed their leaders as &#8220;witch doctors&#8221; and &#8220;reckless demagogues.&#8221; He wrote frankly about the &#8220;&#8216;European&rsquo; element which makes South Africa the only modern and prosperous African country.&#8221;</p>

A September 21, 1965, article by Ernest van den Haag called &#8220;More Immigration?&#8221; took on the impending reform [signed into law on October 3, 1965, by Lyndon Johnson] that would open up America to the Third World. Mr. van den Haag, who is still listed as a contributing editor to NR, argued that our then-sound immigration laws should be made even stricter, not looser. Rejecting the charge that the laws were &#8220;racist,&#8221; he wrote: &#8220;one need not believe that one&rsquo;s own ethnic group, or any ethnic group, is superior to others&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;in order to wish one&rsquo;s country to continue to be made up of the same ethnic strains in the same proportions as before. And, conversely, the wish not to see one&rsquo;s country overrun by groups one regards as alien need not be based on feelings of superiority or &#8216;racism&rsquo;.&#8221; He goes on to say, &#8220;the wish to preserve one&rsquo;s identity and the identity of one&rsquo;s nation requires no justification&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;any more than the wish to have one&rsquo;s own children, and to continue one&rsquo;s family through them need be justified or rationalized by a belief that they are superior to the children of others.&#8221;</p>

Prof. Jeffrey Hart, who is currently listed as a senior editor, called the book a &#8220;sensation&#8221; that rocked liberal sensibilities. He wrote: &#8220;Most people&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;are able to perceive that the &#8216;other group&rsquo; looks rather different and lives rather differently from their own. Such &#8216;racist&rsquo; or &#8216;ethnocentric&rsquo; feelings are undoubtedly healthy, and involve merely a preference for one&rsquo;s own kind. Indeed   &mdash;   and Raspail hammers away at this point throughout his novel   &mdash;   no group can long survive unless it does &#8216;prefer i</p>
<p>tself.&rsquo;&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;The liberal rote anathema on &#8216;racism&rsquo; is in effect a poisonous assault upon Western self-preference.&#8221;</p>

Equally striking evidence of intellectual capacity is provided by the many peoples that never discovered how to kindle a fire or plant a seed. But Dr. Montagu, after making a great show of cautious objectivity, proclaims that &#8216;anthropologists are unable to find any evidence&rsquo; of &#8216;significant differences in mental capacity&rsquo; between &#8216;ethnic groups.&rsquo; If you can tell such whoppers with a straight face, you too can ask the &#8216;United Nations&rsquo; to recognize your right to largesse from the pockets of American taxpayers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

It not only defended their culture, it defended their race. White Southerners had a right   &mdash;   both constitutionally and morally   &mdash;   to protect themselves from black rule and black incivility. White South Africans had the same right. The nation as a whole had a right to defend its European heritage and racial identity by closing its borders to non-whites. As Mr. van den Haag wrote, this policy needed no justification. And if low black intelligence and high crime rates hindered white students from learning, that was sufficient reason for separate education.</p>

It is solidly against affirmative action and multicultural education. It defended&nbsp;<i>The Bell Curve</i>&nbsp;and has published reviews of J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s work. It still advocates immigration reform, though its position now is that a pause in immigration will make it easier for the non-whites who are already here to assimilate. Even that stance could crumble. In 1998 Mr. Buckley demoted the two men most responsible for the magazines anti-immigration tone, editor John O&rsquo;Sullivan and senior editor Peter Brimelow. Filling their places are people like Mr. Ponnuru and John Miller, who like immigration and are afraid of &#8220;identity politics for white people.&#8221; Today&rsquo;s NR is no longer the brave journal that fought integration and tried to keep America European. It is not yelling &#8220;stop&#8221; to multiracialism and the displacement of the country&rsquo;s founding stock by aliens. That, as Mr. Ponnuru explains, would be to play &#8220;tribal politics.&#8221;&nbsp;<img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" width="11" height="11" alt="AR" /></p>
