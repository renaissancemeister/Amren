			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Justin Fenton, Baltimore Sun, November 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics today released a report on homicide trends in the United States between 1980 and 2010, showing that homicide nationwide have declined to the lowest point in four decades.</p>
<p>The largest decline was in cities with a population of one million or more, where the homicide rate dropped from 35.5 homicides per 100,000 residents in 1991 to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2008. The nationwide rate during that time period fell from an all-time high of 9.8 homicides per 100,000 in 1991 to 4.8 in 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report says that most murders are intra-racial  &mdash;  the victimization rate for blacks was 6 times higher than for whites, while the offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than the rate for whites  &mdash;  and the number of homicides known to be caused by gang violence has quadrupled since 1980.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the victimization rate for blacks was 6 times higher than for whites, while the offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than the rate for whites&#8221;</p>
<p>Well that pretty much says it all, doesnt it?  Blacks are killing at a higher rate than they get killed.  Obviously this is borne out by the fact that blacks love killing whites and others outside their race.</p>
<p>&#8220;The largest decline was in cities with a population of one million or more, where the homicide rate dropped from 35.5 homicides per 100,000 residents in 1991 to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2008.&#8221;</p>
<p>This decrease is in large part due to the precipitous decline in New York City homicides during the last 20 years. The Big Apple used to ring up well over 2000 homicides per year in the early 90s. The yearly number nowadays is around 500.  I know I will catch a lot of flak for this comment&hellip;but I think it might have something to do with the stricter gun control laws in NYC these days.  A similar pattern could be observed in Washington DC.  Sorry, but it is my humble opinion that the right to bear arms just does not function very well in a society full of blacks and browns like we have. Do you think the Framers envisioned hordes of blacks and Hispanics getting easy legal access to all sorts of high powered firearms?? Methinks not. All this being said, I am a gun owner myself. But I am also white.</p>

		<p>I followed the link to the tables.  Observation #1:  Hispanics and Arabs are not mentioned.  I presume therefore that they fall under &#8220;white&#8221;.  Observation #2:  it doesn&rsquo;t specify what the &#8220;100,000&#8221; represents in the denominator.  What to do, for example, with the fact that so many black men are imprisoned?  Do they get counted?</p>
<p>My guess is that the real ratio of black to truly white murderers is something over 30 to 1.  The statistics are not clear enough.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that most ALL stats released on any facet of society today have to be viewed with skepticism due to so much manipulation of figures as a result of wide spread political correctness.</p>
<p>Whether those figures regard the &#8220;achievement gap,&#8221; high school drop out rates, test scores, crime figures, or whatever, there&rsquo;s an entire attitude shift that has taken place by those in authority that reflects some kind of perverted desire to fudge figures that support political correctness somehow.  </p>
<p>I know that sounds a bit off-base and extreme, but I truly believe that to be the case. Just look at the lies told about global warming.</p>
<p>Concerning these crime stats, it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe the murder rate is down so significantly.  We&rsquo;ll probably learn later that something has been omitted, or skewed on the local level, or included in other stats and not reported in the right category.</p>
<p>And why shouldn&rsquo;t I feel that way?  &#8220;In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the homicide rate is falling. Doctors are just getting better at saving victims. Stuff like cellphones and paramedics help too. Its not due to lack of trying on the part of the bad guys. The best measure would be to combine the homicide rate with attempted murders. This is the true violent crime rate. Some countries do this. This can make countries like Estonia look more violent then America.</p>

		<p>Recently there was a story on amren where liberals whined that black schoolchildren were being disciplined at twice the rate of white kids (gasp!).</p>
<p>All of which shows the schools are too p.c. Were the black children being punished properly it would be at 6, 7 or 8 times the white rate. </p>

		<p>My theories:</p>
<p>1.  Improved emergency room methods and technology is saving many victims that would have perished as late as 20-30 years ago.  Therefore, the useful crime stat isn&rsquo;t murder or homicide, but aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>2.  Toughened laws, reformed juvenile laws to classify more juveniles as adults, restrictions on judicial leniency, more clever use of law enforcement tactics, have meant that many more black men are in jail or prison than ever before, and are therefore not out on the streets murdering people</p>
<p>3.  The rapid spread of CCW from 1991 to the present time, combined with hearty enforcement of felon-in-possession (of firearms) laws, means that over those 20 or so years, a handgun is more likely to be in the hands of a potential victim than a potential criminal.</p>
<p>4.  And I can&rsquo;t help but think that some of the decrease is statistical legerdemain or cover-up.  NYPD confesses to such.</p>

		<p>Is there any agreed-upon statistic for the number of inter-racial rapes?</p>
<p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics told me that one could be justified in extrapolating from the statistics that an average of 100 white women were raped every day of the year by black men, while few or not one black woman were raped by white men.  However, the BJS qualified this by saying that rape was a very unusual crime and they only had a small sampling of all inter-racial rapes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this same extrapolation printed other places as fact, and, if justified, if true, it is a real horror.  </p>
<p>But is it justified?  Is it true?  Can anyone clarify?</p>

		<p>This very high rate of murder committed by African-Americans is actually less (and in some cases, much less) than in most places African people congregate, such as in Africa, Haiti, Brazil, etc.  Hence, we must be doing something right – Our lavish and multiple social-service programs (free pre-natal care, free birth care, Head-start Program, free day care, Section 8 Housing Program, Food Stamps, busing, Inner-city academies and special schools, academic enrichment, free lunches, free transportation, gas, phone, electric, &amp; internet subsidies, education grants, and affirmative action, etc.), seems to have helped to reduce the African murder rate, here in the USA as compared to elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Africans who reside in the USA are truly blessed.  Imagine having to live in Africa or Haiti, where the murder rate is not only much higher, but where poverty and disease are common.   <br>

		<p>Er&hellip;I need more numbers to get the full picture.  Is this saying that Blacks who comprise ___% of the population  murder at 8 times the rate of Whites who comprise ___% of the population?  So, the probability of a Black being a murderer is___and the probabilty of a White being a murderer is______.</p>
<p>If anyone cares to fill in the blanks with the correct percentages, it&rsquo;d be appreciated.</p>

		<p>Hardly a surprise. The anti-white racist gang attacks of mixed black and Mexican gangs attacking whites in downtonwn Denver is continuing. The presstitutes are pretending that it just started and are covering up the racial motivation and nature of the attacke by obscuring the film footage and pretending that it just started and they are not even mentioning the race of the attackers or the victims. Whites need to travel in groups of 50 whites or they are in trouble. </p>

		<p>The real question is what is the REAL murder rate of whites.</p>
<p>The stats are tainted by the fact that MOST of the &#8220;whites&#8221; who commit these murders are not white.  They don&rsquo;t even pretend anymore and you will see the darkest skinned Haitians with &#8220;white&#8221; as their race.  Part of the problem is large numbers of blacks lying and saying they are white in order to try and make it more difficult to identify them for future crimes or to try and cast &#8220;reasonable doubt&#8221; when they end up in court.  Rather than do the common sense thing and put their real race down, authorities simply put what they say down.</p>
<p>What we need is an authoritative study on how many of these &#8220;whites&#8221; are actually white.  Because it&rsquo;s not like a handful are misclassified.  Most of those &#8220;whites&#8221; are not white and murder is actually quite rare among real whites.</p>

		<p>Another young White man was shot in the neck while walking in the Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia. He&rsquo;s in serious condition. A fine young man who worked hard to help others. His father and brothers were being interviewed in the news broadcast and described him as someone who would l&#8221;ight up a room by entering it.&#8221; <br>
The shooter was of course a Mau Mau who walked up to him and demanded his belongings and before the victim whose name was Neary could respond, he shot him in the neck and then fled like the cowardly pongid that he is.</p>
<p>IN another incident two elderly White people were carjacked at knife point by another Mau Mau at the Franklin Mills Mall in Northeast Philly.  The Mall has been the crime center of the Northeast since the sad day that it opened. </p>
<p>When in HELL are Whites going to start striking back? I suspect that this will not be posted. We have become a nation of milquetoasts who won&rsquo;t even defend ourselves. </p>

<p>No.  It is because many parts of NYC have been gentrified by whites and Asians.  Slum buildings have been replaced by expensive high-rise, luxury housing.   Poor sections of Chelsea, Soho, Tribeca, the far West Side, and the Lower East Side have become expensive neighborhoods. Even the Bowery, long known for &#8220;Bowery Bums&#8221; and transient housing now has stretches of expensive apartment buildings.</p>

		<p>past statistics on murders of whites by blacks were falsified in Calif while my father was in law enforcement there to keep white folk from killing off the black population in revenge.   BLACK MUSLIMS WERE KILLING WHITES IN LARGE NUMBERS  the state knew it but they kept white folk ignorant,  my father was furious about but made sure I knew reality Onesuch killing spat was the zebra killers in SF  look it up fools</p>

<p>You are not off-base or extreme.  You are right.</p>
<p>In the military such fudging of figures is known as &#8220;pencil whipping&#8221; and is the norm.</p>

<p>Both of these cities had a large decline in their black populations during this period.  That&rsquo;s a much better explanation than gun control.  </p>

		<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for federal tax dollars, virtually all black run cities such as Detroit, Gary, Newark, etc. would have standards of living lower than our ancestors in Europe during the middle ages. We didn&rsquo;t regain the standard of living that one would have seen in 2nd or 3rd century AD Rome until around the mid 1800&rsquo;s. With the exception of clocks, firearms, and printing presses, a person like Virgil or a Roman Emperor would not be out of place in Paris or London in 1750. </p>
<p>Improved medical technology has certainly helped to lower the &#8220;murder&#8221; rate. It speaks volumes that military medical teams train at inner city hospitals before they deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan. In suburban hospitals, you are going to see heart disease, diabetes, sports injuries, the occasional car accident and a lot of other run of the mill stuff. Not a great proving ground for dealing with IED&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>20,000 rapes of white women each year by black men, 40 rapes of black women by white men. African Americans are 13% of the population. Any given black man, which is to say every black man in the United States, is 600 times more likely to commit one of these harrowing rapes crossing the color line. Perhaps they aren&rsquo;t good with numbers at Duke University, or any other university in the nation. </p>

		<p>Sorry Gen Lee, it isn&rsquo;t the stricter gun laws.  Blacks and browns don&rsquo;t buy guns through FFL dealers, and they don&rsquo;t register their handguns.  The decline is due to the large number of blacks currently serving life terms in prisons.  But have hope.  There is a new crop of young black males being trained in the gangs and on the street.  That rate will rise again.</p>

<p>______</p>
<p>Here is your &#8220;flak&#8221;. Black criminals don&rsquo;t give a damn about strict gun control laws. Murder rates are higher in places that have them.</p>
<p>The murder rate fell because the crack epidemic in NYC is mostly over and the Zulus who committed the murders are now serving time. Also, a large number of Afrovoodoos have been flushed from NYC and are now in places like Philly that have &#8220;strangely&#8221; experienced increases in their murder rates.</p>

<p>And the conclusion is &hellip;.. ?</p>
<p>1.the US is not a crime-ridden country. Generally, it&rsquo;s safe, as a whole. Of course, it could be better &hellip;</p>
<p>2. the lion share of homicides-percentage goes to Mestizo and Caribbean countries. They&rsquo;re unrivaled. Especially Meso-American countries like Honduras etc. and Caribbean like Jamaica. </p>
<p>3. stats for big countries like China and India are, IMO, not very reliable. Who really knows what&rsquo;s going on where and how ?</p>
<p>4. among White countries, the worst are those having belonged to the European part of ex-USSR (Estonia, Belarus, Russia,..-)</p>
<p>5. no data for the great majority of African countries. Hmmm&hellip;.</p>

		<p> Bill and Bobster, you both make good points. My theory is&hellip;well..just that, a theory.  However I think it is unfounded to suppose that ALL violent crimes and homicides that blacks and browns commit in those cities are done with unregistered and/or illegal firearms. Blacks and browns just seem to lack qualities such as restraint and care (not to mention impulse control) that are essential when dealing with firearms, and that is the thrust of my little theory.</p>
<p>As a related aside, as a gun owner and CCW holder myself, I can attest to the fact that when I walk around my neighborhood in northern VA, I feel much safer with my pistol on me. (if only I could carry it to work with me in DC). However I do find it unfortunate and a bit strange that we almost NEVER seem to hear of stories about black violent crimes being thwarted by gun holding whites.  All I can think of is Bernie Goetz, and that was way back before I was born. As many have mentioned on this very website, if a white opened or returned fire on a criminal black, we would hear about it in the media till the cows came home. But instead all I hear are crickets.</p>

But instead all I hear are crickets.</i></p>
<p>I have two theories:</p>
<p>1.  White CCW permit holders don&rsquo;t deliberately hang out on the wrong side of town.  I have recently said both here and on my own soapbox that I really didn&rsquo;t learn how to be a good coward until I started carrying a gun around legally.</p>
<p>2.  Sometimes, white CCW permit holders don&rsquo;t need to defend themselves against black criminality, because the black criminality doesn&rsquo;t happen because the black criminal fears the potential victim is CCW.</p>
<p>3.  If a white has to defend himself against a black using CCW, and comes out of it alive and uninjured, s/he, the white victim, will often not tell the cops, or anyone, because doing so runs the &#8220;tempest in a teapot&#8221; risk.  If you go running your mouth to the official authorities or anyone, the word will get out, and all the kook cracker jack box black &#8220;reverends&#8221; and the thugs&rsquo; &#8220;mammaz&#8221; will be picketing and chanting in front of your house or your job.  If your defensive firearm use happened to run afoul of the law even one teeny weeny little bit, and the jurisdiction where it happened has a left wing Democrat DA, they will try to string you up.</p>
<p>I have not yet had to show my pistol in self-defense, but if I ever have to, and I&rsquo;m not hurt in the process, and my assailant is black or Hispanic, I&rsquo;m not telling anyone.</p>

		<p>Suicides outnumber murders in the USA. Statistics show that fact by close to a two to one ration. White males are the most prone group to commit it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always said. If you do have to shoot in an &#8220;urban&#8221; area, keep your mouth shut. The cops, media, etc., will just think it was another minority-on-minority crime. </p>

		<p>In the United States the property crime rate peeked in 1980 at 5,353.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010 it was 2,941.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. The rate of violent crime peeked in 1991 at 758.1 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2010 it was 403.6 per 100.000 inhabitants.<br>

In the United States the prison population in 1980 was 315,974. In 2000 it had grown to 1,428,187.<br>

Punishment works. <br>
 <br>
In their book &#8220;Freakonomics&#8221; Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner argue that the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973 has been a major factor in reducing the rate of violent crime. Unmarried, unemployed, poorly educated (and stupid) females are most likely to have abortions. They are also most likely to give birth to boy babies who will become violent street criminals. <br>
 <br>
A potential mugger who was aborted in 1994 would have been eighteen in 1992. <br>
 <br>
The decline in the crime rate in New York city has probably been caused largely by the stop and frisk policy of the police, and by race profiling. Young black and Hispanic men are much more likely to be stopped and frisked by the police than young white and Oriental men. Liberals who have never been victims of violent crime think that is unjust. Liberals who have been victims of violent crimes do not tell their liberal friends what they think of the policy. <br>

		<p>&#8220;This decrease is in large part due to the precipitous decline in New York City homicides during the last 20 years. The Big Apple used to ring up well over 2000 homicides per year in the early 90s. The yearly number nowadays is around 500. I know I will catch a lot of flak for this comment&hellip;but I think it might have something to do with the stricter gun control laws in NYC these days. &#8220;</p>
<p>Gun laws are as complicated as traffic, parking and tax laws.  The blacks don&rsquo;t obey any laws, so the gun laws are a tool to get them to jail and prison where they belong.</p>
<p>Onerous and nitpicky as they are, gun laws are just about the greatest law enforcement tool to control black criminals.</p>
<p>Blacks have the highest rate of gun ownership.  Most of their guns are unregistered, illegally aquired and possesed by felons, parolees, mentally ill and others not eligible to own guns.</p>
<p>They always have unregistered stolen guns around.  So they can be arrested and imprisoned for violating the nitpicky gun laws without the need for manslaughter, attempted murder, armed robbery etc trials.</p>
<p>Cops stop black drivers because so many of them have warrants out.  It&rsquo;s an easy arrest and gets the trash off the street.   The illegal gun gets them longer time.</p>
<p>The more onerous and complicated the liberals make the gun laws, the more of their beloved black criminals will go to prison for gun reg violations.</p>
<p>Unintended consequences.</p>

<p>Excellent advice. Your victim is just one more criminal the cops are happy to be rid of.  I would get a good quality hacksaw, cut the gun into tiny pieces, wrap them in dirty old paper towels, drive 50 miles away and dispose of the pieces over a wide area, such as highway rest stop trash cans.</p>
<p>If caught, &#8220;He called me a White motha fuka and said he gona ki me&#8221;  &#8220;I have pains in my left arm and left side of the chest, get me to a hospital.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Concerning these crime stats, it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe the murder rate is down so significantly. We&rsquo;ll probably learn later that something has been omitted, or skewed on the local level, or included in other stats and not reported in the right category.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are right.  More often than not murder is reduced to manslaughter.  So the statistics show fewer murders but more manslaughters.</p>

		<p>Rockman, I believe it was 271 Whites murdered by black muslims in Ca between 1970 and 1975.  Does that sound right?</p>
<p>Retired San Francisco police have a Zebra memorial service every year in the fall.  If you live in the area, google EAIF and zebra memorial and take the time to go to it next year.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t regain the standard of living that one would have seen in 2nd or 3rd century AD Rome until around the mid 1800&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Depends on whose standards.  Cesear and Virgil had high standards of living, but what about the hundreds of millions of slaves who built and maintained the empire and Rome itself?</p>
