			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Detroit, November 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People who catch the bus in Detroit may be waiting a while Friday. About 100 Detroit Department of Transportation bus drivers are at work, but are refusing to drive their buses.</p>
<p>WWJ&rsquo;s Scott Ryan spoke with Henry Gaffney, spokesman for the D-DOT bus drivers union AFL-CIO Local 26, who said this was not an organized maneuver by the union.</p>
<p>Gaffney said it&rsquo;s a matter of bus drivers fearing for their safety, citing an incident that happened Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our drivers are scared, they&rsquo;re scared for their lives. This has been an ongoing situation about security. I think yesterday kind of just topped it off, when one of my drivers was beat up by some teenagers down in the middle of Rosa Parks and it took the police almost 30 minutes to get there, in downtown Detroit,&#8221; said Gaffney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gaffney said bus safety is an ongoing problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&rsquo;s to the point where if the driver is not safe on the bus, then the passengers are not safe, then the citizens are not safe. You know, what about them too? We have no security, you can&rsquo;t get the police, nobody is doing anything to protect us. And I&rsquo;ve been begging the mayor and the council for two years to do something to help us,&#8221; said Gaffney.</p>
<p>But, Serkaian said there are discussions in the city right now to improve bus safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a concern. We want to protect drivers and passengers alike. We used to have police presence on the buses. We&rsquo;re talking about the prospect of perhaps trailing buses with police cars. Nothing has been decided, it&rsquo;s all in discussion right now,&#8221; said Serkaian. {snip}</p>

		<p>Detroit bus services should simply incorporate armed guards, as in the days of the stagecoach.</p>
<p>And forget proportionate response - a load of OO buck should be the response to being threatened with a gun, knife, or simply mob violence. </p>

<p>Rosa Parks should have stayed in back of the bus where she belonged.</p>
<p>SEGREGATION or deportation (I opt for deportation) is the ONLY solution to the black problem.</p>
<p>WE all KNOW it, yet nothing is being done about it. Just talk and more talk which gets us nowhere. Blacks just get worse and worse.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incredible. A complete breakdown in the most basic services of a large city.</p>
<p>After 50 years the question is not how to help blacks but how to escape them - or remove them. Anyone with a functioning brain can immediately identify the cause - uncivilized black behavior.</p>
<p>What kind of a country is it where one part of the population can put a man on the moon while another part has laid waste to a city and crippled bus service for people who generally have no other form of transportation. </p>
<p>How bad must it be when 100 workers in a precarious economy refuse to show up to a job that requires simply driving a bus because they &#8220;fear for their lives&#8221;?</p>
<p>The only answer is segregation or secession to a fortified white homeland.  </p>
<p>Because in time all the buses will stop running.</p>

		<p>There was a decoy program in Detroit during the late 1960&rsquo;s and early 1970&rsquo;s that was extremely successful in lowering crime rates.  Called STRESS (Stop The Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets) the program involved police officers who would dress up and mimic older, defenseless people.  When accosted by the so-called misguided (black) &#8220;youths&#8221; of the day, they would defend themselves with deadly force.  Coleman Young (one of the most racist mayors in the country) ran for mayor with the promise that, if elected, he would disband STRESS.  Of course, the criminal elements cheered and assured his election (and subsequent re-election).  His promise to stop the killing of these black &#8220;youths&#8221; accelerated the downward spiral into anarchy that is the case of Detroit today.  The 1967 &#8220;riot&#8221; was the nail in the coffin that is Detroit &hellip;</p>

<p>Yes, it was all planned. Even the so-called &#8220;reporter&#8221; on that bus was a plant. The whole civil rights movement/MLK was just another of many &#8220;movements&#8221; to destroy White America, thereby destroying America, period.</p>
<p> The Feminist movement, the 1965 Immigration Act, AA, hate crime laws, the NAACP, LaRaza, Mecha, borderless borders, ACLU, ADL/SPLC and the list is endless, were all planned for the destruction of our race. And to think that there are still so many Whites that can&rsquo;t put 2 and 2 together and realize they are HATED and targeted for extinction is beyond ignorance.</p>

		<p>I would assume that most of these drivers are black, so cries of racism should be pointless if the buses have to be provided with armed guards or police.  Probably, they will need cops, who have the authority to question, search, and arrest  &mdash;  or to shoot if the predator has a weapon.  Private security would probably be too hesitant to take extreme action and would be seen by many criminals as just another potential victim.  Some of these civilian guards are criminals themselves or are not trained well.  Of course, in Detroit, the police are often not the finest either, and whether the city can or will provide funding is questionable.  The place sounds more and more like S.A. ghettoes.</p>

<p>There may have been a second woman too but she was a teenager and known for her dirty mouth and a constant stream of curse words so she too was deemed unfit. That famous photo of Rosa sitting in a bus looking out the window with a white man sitting behind her was also a posed photo.</p>

		<p>Any white person who truly has his or hers eyes and ears open know that most blacks are simply incapable of functioning in an advanced western society except by coercion.  Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve never been attacked by blacks-but on a daily basis I see examples of their dysfunctional, obnoxious, and disrespectul behaviours.  Yes, I would like to see some kind of separation, but until then if at all, all I can recommend is good physical conditioning, projecting a &#8220;streetwise&#8221; attitude at all times and refusing, even if that means being armed,to be a victim.  Unfortunatley, too many members of this lesser-evolved race we have to deal with, understands nothing else. </p>

<p>I expect to see that in most black cities within 10 yrs, just like subway drivers are safely enclosed.  I&rsquo;m surprised it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, but each city is probably afraid to go first.  It would definitely be bad publicity for public transportation!  <br>

		<p>I have been to Detroit.  I wanted to see The Spirit of Man statue.  I would have to say that Detroit is the unique apocalyptic apotheosis of the realization of the concept and plan to overthrow of America.  </p>
<p>It is the ultimate illustration of prophecy.</p>
<p>America must be reduced to Detroit in order for the transformation to be complete&hellip;but,the white race has had a hellofa run.  </p>
<p>Just look at what Detroit once represented (even if its great rise was carried out by Yankee Industrialists, and even if the poor Southern whites along with the Southern blacks were treated like rats in its factories)&hellip;great wealth and people like Henry Ford (who was a buddy of Hitler before the war!), who was no liberal by any means and yet the liberals infiltrated that $ bank and look at the Ford Foundation now&hellip;wow what a wonderful prize that turned out to be for the radical left.</p>
<p>I was glad to get out of Detroit!  Whew&hellip;but there are certainly a lot of other cities where bus drivers are frightened by *teenagers*&hellip;and that&rsquo;s been the plan all along.  </p>
<p>Nothing less than we deserve.</p>

		<p>Detroit is a catastrophe in the making.  Crime continues to accelerate, and revenue continues to fall, requiring massive spending cuts to meet budgets.</p>
<p>How long can the police continue to concentrate on bus crimes when there will be fewer of them from this point forward?</p>
<p>Also, keep an eye on Camden and Newark, two of the highest crime cities in the country.  Both had to lay off a huge portion of their police departments due to falling revenues that are continuing to fall right now.</p>
<p>Are all these urban areas going to implode into no-go zones?</p>
<p>It looks like they are.  We&rsquo;re living in interesting times.</p>

		<p>Rosa Parks, like Michael King, was a Communist Party member. She was selected and trained by the Communist Party,because she was a light skinned black, and they believed that that would give her more sympathy when the News Media played their scam to the Liberals in Boston, etc.. It worked perfectly. </p>
<p>Now, no one can ride the Bus in peace and safety. What progress we have made. </p>
<p>People can watch videos of King such as, &#8220;Beast as Saint&#8221; and others on Rosa Parks, on You Tube. I recommend that you watch them with your family, so they can learn something that they won&rsquo;t hear in School. </p>

		<p>This kind of crime has been going on for a long time.  I was taking the New York City IRT Broadway express train north out of Times Square in the early 1960&rsquo;s when there was a long delay.  It turned out be the murder of the motorman on an uptown express train between Times Square and West 72nd Street.  A black man was threatening a white woman in the front of the head car.  The motorman stopped the train between stations so that he could protect the woman.  The motorman had been an army MP during the Korean War was no match for the black man with a knife.</p>
<p>I used to be a supporter of public transportation but have come to realize that it can be very dangerous unless you live in a civilized society.</p>

Sadness and Anger After a Legend Is Mugged</p>

<p>Her face bruised and her lip swollen, Rosa Parks, the mother of the civil rights movement, seemed more sad than angry today as she quietly described being robbed and beaten in her bedroom here on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret very much that some of our people are in such a mental state that they would hurt and rob an older person,&#8221; Mrs. Parks said as she sat in living room of her modest, rented home, five blocks from the boulevard named in her honor. &#8220;In these times, none of us seem to be safe from this type of treatment and violation by a sick-minded person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks, who is 81, said her assailant appeared not to recognize her, although she is known throughout the neighborhood. Indeed, her suspected attacker, who made off with less than $100, was known there, too. Based on her description of the suspect, neighbors found and held the man for the police this afternoon.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Benny Napoleon said the name of the suspect, who is 28, would not be released until he was charged, probably on Thursday morning. The suspect is likely to be charged with breaking and entering, and assault and battery.</p>

Mrs. Parks urged people not to read too much into the attack. But inevitably, she reflected on how things had changed since 1955, when she sat down on a Montgomery, Ala., bus and in her soft but firm voice said she would not yield her seat to a white man, setting off a 381-day bus boycott and a revolution against Jim Crow law. &#8216;Still Have a Long Way to Go&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many gains have been made,&#8221; she said, her hands folded in her lap and her hair crossed in two silver braids over her head. &#8220;But as you can see, at this time we still have a long way to go and so many of our children are going astray.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks&rsquo;s neighbors, who said they viewed her not as a celebrity but as a communal grandmother   &mdash;   a source of warm greetings and birthday cards   &mdash;   took a less compassionate tone. To many, the attack was particularly galling because it was apparently committed by a black man.</p>
<p>&#8220;For her to have been a legend, to have paved the way for our race, and yet, the same young man who beat her, she struggled to better his own life,&#8221; said James Foster, a 70-year-old neighbor. &#8220;It&rsquo;s outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks said the attack left her fearful for the first time on the tidy, West Side block where she has lived for six years.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks&rsquo;s lawyer, Gregory J. Reed, said she would spend the night in a temporary room in a gated, guarded apartment complex downtown, then move into an apartment there when one becomes available.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks moved to Detroit in 1957, after her role in the Montgomery bus boycott made it impossible for her to find work there, Mr. Reed said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks continued working as a seamstress, then joined the staff of Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, in 1965, retiring in 1988, said her executive assistant, Elaine Steele. Her husband, Raymond, died in 1979. In the 80&rsquo;s, Mrs. Parks founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development to help the city&rsquo;s children. Mayor Is Outraged</p>
<p>In a statement from Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, where he is vacationing, Mayor Dennis W. Archer said: &#8220;I personally and deeply resent any of our citizens&rsquo; being assaulted and becoming victims of crime. It is more insulting when Rosa Parks, who sat down to give us an equal opportunity to compete, becomes a victim of crime in her own home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several of Mrs. Parks&rsquo;s neighbors worried that news of the attack would further damage Detroit&rsquo;s tattered reputation, just as the first signs of a turnaround are appearing. &#8220;We&rsquo;re starting to change, and this is just going to drag us down,&#8221; Derek Shirley, 26 said. &#8220;For something to happen to a lady that did so much for the black cause   &mdash;   that ain&rsquo;t right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of Mrs. Parks&rsquo;s neighbors caught the suspect at a nearby grocery and liquor story. &#8220;Apparently they know this guy from the neighborhood,&#8221; Deputy Chief Napoleon said. He said he did not know if the man, who is suspected in two other burglaries, was roughed up.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks said that as she prepared for bed on Tuesday evening, she heard a loud noise downstairs, and then a man calling out. When she came down, the man told her that someone had broken in her back door, but he had chased him away. Mrs. Parks has a security system, but it was disconnected after malfunctioning last year, Ms. Steele said. What the Intruder Said</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to protect me, is what he said, and he wanted me to give him some money,&#8221; Mrs. Parks said. He asked for three or four dollars, then followed Mrs. Parks upstairs as she went to get it. Once in her bedroom, however, the man, whom Mrs. Parks said reeked of alcohol, demanded all her money. She resisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s when he started pushing me around and hitting me,&#8221; she said. As she fell on her bed, trying to pull her money out of her pocket, the man continued to strike her in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never been hit in that manner in my life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was screaming and trying to ask him not to hit me.&#8221; Once she gave him her money, Mrs. Parks said, the man left.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks then phoned Ms. Steele, who lives across the street, and Ms. Steele called the police. The police took between 45 and 50 minutes to reach her home, a fact that infuriated some of her friends. In Need of Medical Help</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Rudy Thomas said the attack &#8220;didn&rsquo;t receive priority one, when life endangerment is imminent.&#8221; Instead, Mrs. Parks&rsquo; more urgently needed medical attention, he said. He said the city&rsquo;s Emergency Medical Service responded within about 11 minutes of the 911 operator&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital, where she was treated for her bruises and released.</p>
<p>Mrs. Parks said she had intended to move several months ago to the apartment complex, called Riverfront Apartments, because she was tired of going up and down stairs. But Mr. Reed said the complex had recently told her that they had no room. Today, the complex speedily arranged for the temporary room.</p>
<p>Many of her neighbors saw her moving as an ominous sign. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to lose her, right?&#8221; said Moses Miles, 64. &#8220;Anytime we can&rsquo;t protect our great leaders, we&rsquo;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;There may have been a second woman too but she was a teenager and known for her dirty mouth and a constant stream of curse words so she too was deemed unfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pregnant.  They thought, wonderful, wait till the 8th month when she is really big and what great publicity.  They tried to rid her speech of curse words. Failed, like many blacks, she did not know the difference between curse words and other words. The baby daddy was an older married black man.  She was not exactly a prostitute, never been arrested, but exchanged favors with the married man.</p>
<p>So they settled on Rosa who attended that Highland School communist training camp along with MLK and Angela Davis&rsquo; Mother.</p>
<p>Ms Davis by the way, was sponsored by the Quaker Church.</p>

How long can the police continue to concentrate on bus crimes when there will be fewer of them from this point forward?</p>
<p>(Fewer buses or fewer bus crimes?&hellip;if there are fewer buses that might be a good idea for these areas&hellip;looks like America is going to need to invest heavily in more prison space.)</p>
<p>Also, keep an eye on Camden and Newark, two of the highest crime cities in the country. Both had to lay off a huge portion of their police departments due to falling revenues that are continuing to fall right now.</p>
<p>(And Cincinnati and Memphis&hellip;the feds should give those cities $ for prisons instead of money for transit programs in order to haul thoses thugs around all day&hellip;the city buses in my city are empty and the transit program is in debt.)</p>
<p>Are all these urban areas going to implode into no-go zones?</p>
<p>(Well, they certainly may well *implode*&hellip;) </p>
<p>It looks like they are. We&rsquo;re living in interesting times.</p>
<p>(Interesting times, indeed.)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before.  I raised my kids in a completely White very wealthy section of the city.  I lucked out on the house, it was a duplex, I had a partner in the property, only way I could afford to buy it.</p>
<p>I sent my kids to private schools.  They took the bus to school and all around town. It was a struggle but I managed it.  </p>
<p>One day I was cooking dinner and they and 2 friends were doing homeowrk on the dining room table.  It was MLK month.  With January devoted to MLK and February black falsehood and fantasy history month,it lasts 2 months. The friend was doing her anti White propaganda homework. She went to a different private school, the most expensive and exclusive in the city.  My children&rsquo;s schools ignored PC and black history.</p>
<p>Suddenly she piped up &#8220;they used to have to ride in the back of the bus&#8221;  My son  &#8220;what a good idea.&#8221;  My daughter &#8220;can we make that law again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those kids lived in one of the richest neighborhoods in the city.  They went to private schools.  But they took the city bus to school, to visit friends and around town.  They never rode through black neighborhoods, but they saw enough to know how blacks behave in public.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe liberals never in their lives take public transport. They know how blacks behave but deny it and impose the primitive bahavior on us.</p>
