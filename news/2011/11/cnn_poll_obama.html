			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama&rsquo;s overall approval rating remains in the mid-40s, where it has been since July, and he continues to receive much higher marks for foreign policy than for domestic issues, according to a new national survey out one year before he is up for re-election.</p>
<p>{snip} By contrast, only 35% have a positive view of his economic track record, and just 38% approve of how he is handling health care policy.</p>
<p>It all adds up to an overall 46% approval rating for the president, with 52% saying they disapprove of how Obama is handling his job in the White House.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In comparison to recent incumbents running for re-election, Obama&rsquo;s 46% approval ranks above only Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford  &mdash;  who both lost their re-election bids  &mdash;  in November of the year before an election. Most incumbents who were re-elected had an approval rating above 50% a year before the election. But George W. Bush, at 50%, and Richard Nixon, at 49%, also won re-election, and Bush&rsquo;s father George H.W. Bush had a 56% approval rating yet lost to Bill Clinton the following year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} White Americans give Obama a thumbs down by a 61%-36% margin, with non-white Americans give the president a thumbs up by a more than 2-1 margin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s policies are almost identical to Bush, yet he wakes up whites and creates a backlash. I would rather have him for another four years than have millions of whites being horse fed amnesty for illegals and war with Iran by some generic GOP elitist.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe 36% of whites give Obama a &#8220;thumbs up.&#8221; If whites took to tribalism the way blacks do his approval should only be about 10%. Only in the deep-south states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana did whites behave tribal by casting 80-plus percent of their votes for fellow white John McCain (and of course he had nothing to offer them). If whites had any common sense they wouldn&rsquo;t have drooled over this inexperienced empty suit in the first place during the presidential primaries in Iowa, Oregon, Vermont etc. It was white liberals who gave us candidate Obama in the first place, only southern states like SC have primary voters that are heavily black . We&rsquo;re are own worst enemy. How can so many whites be so dumb? I guess our race really isn&rsquo;t creme de la creme of humanity afterall.</p>

		<p>#1 you are so on target.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get it. You have a GOP debate where with the exception of Ron Paul the rest are just more of the same Neocons. They openly say they will attack Iran. Well that certainly means economic catastrophe. As far as immigration, AA, or anything us WN care about they do not care about. Of course, all along I knew the Tea Party was the controlled opposition. I say do not vote, vote Third Party, or yes even Obama. At least there is a small chance he will not attack Iran. Besides Obama is good for waking up potential WN!</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s goal is to create a non-white majority in the USA, everything else is simply a means towards that goal. Its all about racial replacement no matter how good the camoflouge. Any white who supports Obama is a self loathing traitor.</p>

		<p>Talk show hosts and white leaders like Michael Savage should stop attacking other white men like Mark Levin and attack our actual enemies. Can you imagine ANY black host attacking another black? At least whenï»¿ one black sees another black they know whose side their on 98 percent voted Obama. Whites are divided.</p>

		<p>This is why our country is doomed to become a third world hellhole. Here you have an incompetent president who makes the recession he inherited worse and yet nonwhites still support him because of his skin color.</p>
<p>Just as they continually re-elected Robert Mugabe, Hugo Chavez and Detroit mayor Coleman Young they&rsquo;ll pull the lever for a Marxist who&rsquo;s caused black unemployment to skyrocket to 17%. </p>

		<p>#1 Phil, Obama is even more eager to have an illegal alien amnesty than George W. Bush was.  He issued an executive order that effectively amnesties a very large fraction of the illegal aliens.</p>
<p>As for war with Iran, Obama and hawk Hillary seem to be sliding into it as surely as the neocon Republicans.  Only Ron Paul will keep us out of that disastrous war.<br>

		<p>#2  - I&rsquo;m also confused &amp; frustrated about that 36%. I think that when it comes to whites, the Dems are down to university English departments and the bubble-head students they teach, government workers, naive soccer moms, journalists, stoners, trial attorneys, most Jews and various other types who will one day see the OWS movement as the high point of their lives. The trouble is that the Dems only need about 35% of the white vote now, since they can count on 90% of the non-white vote. We are seeing the last stages of a long-term strategy that was based on the recognition that US-born whites increasingly have little reason to support treasonous Democrats. The Dems have known for a long time that their next generation of voters has to come from somewhere. Mexico, for example&hellip;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute disgrace that there are as many as 36% of whites who will likely vote for this inept, anti-white, anti-Western fool.</p>
<p>The masters of manipulation have conditioned the white weenies efficiently&hellip;.or is it that there is a large percentage of whites who are too naive to understand that this man is taking their country away from them&hellip;..or do they just not care?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it&rsquo;s important to cull the herd from time to time just for survival&rsquo;s sake if nothing else.<br>

<p>Levin and Weiner hate each other because they occupy the same time slot.  Nothing more.  Purely a matter of an eardrum listening to one is not an eardrum listening to the other.</p>

<p>That is some statement. The GOP are far worse. All they do is temporary sooth gullible Whites who think they (the GOP) is working for Whites in America. Therefore the borders continue to be flooded with Non-Whites, jobs are shipped overseas, White workers wages go down and nothing changes as far as Affirmative Action. Someone above said Obama MIGHT get us In a war with Iran. That is true. However the Republicans will get us in a war for sure (with the exception being Ron Paul who is not a Republican in today&rsquo;s sense anyway)<br>
as stated above some like Obama advances WN by mobilizing the people. #4 I guess that makes me a self loathing traitor in your eyes. So that implies anyone is better than Obama for WN. Well sir you are WRONG. Those lying Neocons are race traitors of the worse kind. And there is nothing lower than that. Go ahead hang on to your CONservative Illusion. I believe 4 more years like we had with Bush will completely destroy the country. We will be so broke and in debt that WN problems will be impossible to solve.</p>

		<p>What difference does it make who wins the election? There&rsquo;s no fundamental difference between the parties. Obama has continued the Bush policies and the Republicans will continue Obama&rsquo;s policies. The rhetoric will change. Different special interest groups will get a chance to cash in, but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>The only difference between Democrat and Republican candidates is that they have to appeal to different bases during the nominating process. Obama has to appeal to the left; the Republicans to the right. The nominees then move to the center and once they get into office, it&rsquo;s business as usual in the District of Corruption.</p>
<p>Elections don&rsquo;t matter for another fundamental reason. The country is toast, the problems intractable and nobody has the slightest idea what to do for the simple reason that there isn&rsquo;t anything to do. The real economy has been outsourced. The feds are 15 trillion in debt. There are hundreds of trillions in toxic derivatives floating around out there. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time now before the dollar loses its reserve currency status and the US will be forced into a major devaluation. It&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>This election is nothing more than a game of musical chairs on the deck of the Titanic.</p>

		<p> While  I agree Obama is just a rocket sled to displacement all the Republicans really want to offer is a slightly slower slide into oblivion. With the exception of Ron Paul the elite candidates don&rsquo;t care about us at all when there&rsquo;s corporate money to be had.<br>
 I think Ron Paul as a constitutionalist will have to do away with affirmative action and do away with a great deal of the welfare state. If he can do these two things whites will have more children and assuming a level playing field we will start to get ahead. I  fear equality not a whit.</p>

		<p>QD (#12): is correct. If Levin and Savage were on the same station rather than competing with each other they&rsquo;d be yukking it up.</p>
<p>Levin, Limbaugh and Michael Medved dislike Ron Paul because they&rsquo;re neocons.</p>
