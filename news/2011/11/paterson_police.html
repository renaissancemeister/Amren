<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said Wednesday they&rsquo;ve arrested the trio caught on tape attacking two people, including chopping at one victim with a machete. {snip}</p>
<p>The incident took place on Sept. 10 at the U.S. Chicken restaurant at 194 Straight St. Police said the &#8220;vicious assault&#8221; began just before 4 a.m.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Both attacks were unprovoked, as far as we could see. Nothing was taken in the second attack,&#8221; [Police Capt. Heriberto] Rodriguez told CBSNewYork.</p>
<p>In the first case, the victim, seen on the video wearing a white shirt with a black insignia on the top left corner, was attempting to walk out of the restaurant when he was confronted by two men in the doorway. While they talk, police say Omar Villota, 22, comes up behind him and pistol whips him in the back of the head. The trio tumble into the street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the group comes tumbling back into the restaurant, this time struggling with a second victim. The second victim is seen on tape being repeatedly punched in the face, allegedly by 20-year-old Johel Gomez. Police said Tyree Seegers, 22, then started hacking at the second victim with a machete.</p>
<p>According to police, Seegers is seen on the tape hacking at the victim at least 14 times with the machete. During one of his swings, he chops into Villota, who is continually pistol-whipping the victim. Seegers nearly severs Villota&rsquo;s right arm, leaving a blood trail that the cops used to track them down.</p>
<p>As the victim lays apparently unconscious on the ground, Gomez allegedly kicks him in the head.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Amazingly, despite the intensity of the punches, kicking and hacking with the machete, the second victim is not seriously hurt, police say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rodriguez said the reason the victim is still alive is because Seegers was lousy with the machete.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one time he swung it straight and effectively, he hit his own counterpart, his owns friend,&#8221; Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>73 years ago I was born in Paterson, NJ.  I guess it was more peaceable then.  People were too busy finding their way out of the depression to find time to cut each other up with machetes.</p>

		<p>Dominicans and all night fried chicken are a bad mix.  </p>
<p>Newark is constantly having murders take place in and in front of all night fried chicken joints.  </p>

		<p>More multicultural enrichment. We have been importing millions of hispanics as a new and &#8220;improved&#8221; cheap labor source. Once again the rich are bringing in immigrants to take advantage of their cheap labor and letting the rest of us pick up the tab in the form of increased cost of police, jails, dysfunctional schools, out of control welfare spending and fraud, overwhelmed and bankrupt hospitals, increased crime and loss of civility in our communities.   How is this any different than the mistake we made bringing in African slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries?  Long after the individual profits that slave owners experienced have vanished we are still paying for their short sighted greed.  Stop all non-white immigration now.</p>

		<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree with Enough more.  Agree with the entire post.  The only thing that will stop this importation is if we prosecute employers who hire these illegal and undesirable immigrants over Americans.  </p>

<p>Trust your intuition, my friend. He probably glared at the booking camera on purpose, so he could brag to his buddies about what a tough guy he was.</p>

		<p>How about this one?  More MSM propaganda showing a WHITE kid with a toy gun. Use this article when making your case of the anti-White, lying MSM. </p>

<p>Perhaps I should have been more clear.  You&rsquo;re probably right that he did the &#8220;tough guy&#8221; act for the mug shot.  By &#8220;bad seed,&#8221; I meant in comparison to the other two, who have that usual dull, duh, &#8220;nobody&rsquo;s home&#8221; look about them, the way most violent black men appear.</p>
<p>Seegers has that look that reminds me of the John Katehis case (use your favorite internet search engine).  Katehis had that same sort of evil eye bad seed appearance.</p>
