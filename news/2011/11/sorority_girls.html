			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NY Daily News, November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A sorority at the University of Southern Mississippi has placed six of its members on probation for dressing in blackface to depict the Huxtable family from &#8220;The Cosby Show&#8221; and attending a 1980s-themed costume party last week off campus.</p>
<p>The university and the sorority confirmed the incident Monday in statements released via the university. {snip}</p>
<p>Joe Paul, vice president of student affairs, says the executive officers of Phi Mu and the women involved met on Sunday with a group of African-American student leaders at the university.</p>
<p>Phi Mu National President Kris Bridges says the matter is being investigated and more disciplinary action could follow. She says the local chapter will sponsor a campus-wide program on diversity appreciation.</p>

		<p>By emulating blacks, weren&rsquo;t the girls participating in diversity already? And if blacks are so strong, why can&rsquo;t they be criticized?</p>
<p><br>
Perhaps the girls can make amends by making a statue of an African-American with a simple caption: &#8220;god&#8221;. It appears to be true for this university.</p>

		<p>Please explain to me why dressing like the Huxtables is offensive, let alone worthy of punishment.  BTW don&rsquo;t black women straighten their hair, some color their hair blonde and red.  These are Caucasian attributes.  </p>

		<p>Utterly ridiculous.  Dressing as the Huxtables in no way insults Blacks (it may, however, FLATTER Blacks unduly).  This sort of thing has been adequately addressed in comments on similar articles here at American Renaissance.  No more really needs to be said, about why it is the girls did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The ideal thing would be for Phi Mu to stand their ground and defend the girls.  And the university, too, should have pointed out the illogic and double standards inherent in objections to the girls&rsquo; going in Blackface as the Huxtables.  Or the sorority could make it clear that the cowardice exhibited by the school&rsquo;s administration has caused them to wish to no longer have a chapter at Southern.</p>
<p>Maybe that would frighten the school, since a great many girls start at Southern, since it is easier to get into the top sororities there.  Second year, these little social climbers transfer to chapters at Ole Miss and Vanderbilt, where it&rsquo;s hard to get in: it&rsquo;s quite expected of girls from new-rich families. How many times have I heard, &#8220;Oh, she got in the back way, she started at Southern.&#8221; But those girls do dress up the campus at Southern. They have great cars and clothes, and the school needs their little touch of arriviste &#8216;class&rsquo;.  Half the time, these girls fall in love with Hattiesburg, the only even halfway fun place to live in Mississippi, and finish at Southern, rather than move to the decidedly grim/paranoid/mean social scene at Ole Miss.</p>
<p>But since the school and the sorority seem unwilling to defend these girls, I think they should de-pledge.  They did nothing wrong at that OFF-CAMPUS party, and should have nothing further to do with an organization so cowardly as to sell them out.  And really, there are plenty of schools in America, to which they could transfer, with just as good a range of majors&hellip;and where they will be likely to meet far blonder and richer boys.</p>

		<p>Incidents like this are all about POWER. The power of anti-Whites to control Whites&rsquo; actions, Whites&rsquo; language, and Whites&rsquo; thoughts. The immediate aim is to make ALL actions or expressed thoughts about race off limits to Whites except the actions and thoughts that are prescribed for them. The ultimate aim is White Genocide.</p>

		<p>There have been many excellent comments here about the fact that there is really nothing insulting about dressing as the Huxtables in an 80s themed party and related issues. But it seems to me that the University has no business butting into the affair at all SINCE IT TOOK PLACE OFF CAMPUS and Phi Mu should, as one commenter said, support the young women. If they don&rsquo;t, the girls should resign from the sorority. Also, they should have their famale relatives who are and were members put pressure on the sorority to support the young women. </p>
<p>Maybe the sorority should change their name to Phi Baa Baa Baa. Really, none of the people, even Phi Mu have any business rerprimanding the girls and it is an absolute travesty that they have to meet with black students in what is really nothing more than A RITUAL FORM OF HUMILIATION AND DEGRADATION! </p>
<p>All of these sorts of attacks on any whites not deemed politically correct (the term and idiology of political correctness are from the communist Soviet Union and should be disgarded as the tryanny that they are) should be recongnized for what they are: a racist attack on whites that results in the humiliation and degradation of whites when they have done nothing wrong! </p>
<p>Franky, as these communist attitude adjustments in the form of reeducaion continue I do not see how we will ever have peace between the races because whites are getting righteously indignant about these racist attacks on their people and entire race! THESE UNJUST HUMILIATION RITUALS PERPETRATED BY THOSE WHO ARE THEMSELVES ANTI-WHITE RACIST BIGGOTS HAVE GOT TO STOP!</p>

The irony here is that far from being racists, these girls were doing a homage to one of their favorite sit-com families.</p>
<p>They thought there were celebrating black culture and for their so-called ignorance, they will be vilified.</p>
<p>When it comes to blacks, no good or innocent action goes unpunished.</p>

		<p>If the school officials really &#8220;celebrated diversity&#8221; they would applaud the Huxtable imitation.  What they&rsquo;re practicing is censorship and intimidation of whites who were expressing a humorous portrayal of blacks.   This doesn&rsquo;t fit their marxist world-view and pricks their ultra-thin skin.  By the way, how did anti-white marxists come to run a university in MISSISSIPPI?</p>

		<p>Blacks carry on about being offended constantly as a means of extortion.  They can&rsquo;t get by any other way.  I&rsquo;ve never heard any other group engage in such whining and neediness, all wrapped up in sullen thanklessnes and violence.  Something has to give eventually.</p>

		<p>Whites pretending to be black: that&rsquo;s discrimination, and you&rsquo;d better not do it.</p>
<p>Men pretending to be women: that&rsquo;s drag culture, and you&rsquo;d better respect it.</p>
<p>Because identity is malleable and fun and belongs to everybody, unless we&rsquo;re born with it and it is serious and divides us.  And it&rsquo;s good to be divided, except we must all be together.  Just do what you&rsquo;re told and you can have freedom of expression.</p>
<p>This atheist swears to God in heaven that when I was a child, it was the left that was for free speech and the right that wasn&rsquo;t.  But I see more free inquiry at sites like AmRen than I see on any left site.  Like it says at the top of every page here, &#8220;There is not a truth existing which I fear or would wish unknown to the whole world.&#8221;  Or a joke.</p>

		<p>Here is another example of people as much as saying that there&rsquo;s something wrong with being black.  Folks can&rsquo;t even dress up as symbols of admirable blacks without the receipt of outrage and scorn.  It gives these young women  &mdash;  and millions more who hear about the incident  &mdash;  just one more reason to avoid anything having to do with blacks or matters black.</p>

		<p>All this outrage about offending Blacks yet they (Blacks) can stand on a corner and openly call for the killing of  Whites (crackers) and their little babies and I hear no outrage even from Whites.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the ultimate hate speech. Why is no one shocked and appalled by that? Doesn&rsquo;t that constitute terrorist threats and HATE?</p>
<p>Another poster mentioned this incident on this site and I have yet to see any response. To me that it the most abominable thing that I&rsquo;ve heard so far and yet there is no anger?</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re just trying to make whites resentful of the more special privileges that will be enjoyed for all that are not white? Just as in California, where there is a small Africa American population, they are overly obsessed with athletics? Or is it meant to brow-beat whites into line?</p>

		<p>I disagree that the girls thought they were doing nothing wrong. What they were told to get them to go along is anybody&rsquo;s guess. These exact same caricatures have been going on for over 20 years or at least are well-publicized. Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza, in his book &#8216;illiberal education&rsquo; pointed out that these near exact same displays were by white kids were going on over 20 years ago. The university always responds with tolerance training for all whites and promises to hire or promote even more colored activists. </p>

		<p>What silliness. Sure, many decades ago some genuinely tasteless shows were performed in blackface, but it&rsquo;s time to move on. Has been for a long time, too. It&rsquo;s no wonder that the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow persists, when blacks and their fans cling to every single insult and injury, no matter how petty, with the desperation of drowning men.</p>

<p>Obviously. Now, of course it is possible to be offensive that way. Say you put on blackface and then act like the dumbest possible ghetto trash. Or you put on whiteface and act like dumbest possible trailer trash. Just dressing up as a member of another race is completely harmless, unless of course it&rsquo;s deliberately made otherwise.</p>

		<p>Well, if that article was not enough to make you sick, try THIS little YouTube treat: <br>
<a href="http://goo.gl/fU776" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/fU776</a></p>
<p>Y&rsquo;know, I was too poor, starting college, to go to Ole Miss.  And I was too poor for all the costs associated with following my female relatives into Chi Omega.  And when Daddy&rsquo;s ship came in, shortly thereafter, and I was sent to Tulane, I&rsquo;d already wised-up.  That video pretty-well illustrates the mentality I observed among the &#8216;Greeks&rsquo;.  &#8216;Lowest Common Denominator&rsquo; no longer describes the culture among the Frats and Suzies down here.  They&rsquo;re way below the LCD, if you ask me.</p>
<p>But, as you can see here, the worship of African Americans in sports and entertainment is so much a part of Mississippi&rsquo;s &#8216;Greek&rsquo; culture, those girls really and truly were clueless that they might get in trouble for emulating the Huxtables&hellip;.right down to their skin tone.</p>

		<p>I am shocked that people are making this such a big deal. These girls are being put through so much, because they dressed up as their favorite t.v show? Be honest, all of you who think what they did was wrong, did you even know what black face was? It is a shame that people are blowing this out of proportion like they are. What about the movie White Chicks? Two black men dressed up as white girls, stereotyping the way they act. Yet, there was no argument about this. </p>

		<p>When I was at UCLA around 1995 or so, a fraternity had a party and served tequila.  The hispanic grievance groups had a fit.  They claimed it was bigoted and discriminatory to serve tequila at a party.  The administration backed the grievance group of course.</p>
<p>I think the fraternity got suspended for a year and of course there was all the weeping and wailing from all the other grievance groups on campus.</p>

		<p>Thank you, Question Diversity, for the photo.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t even Blackface the girls are wearing (compare, please with the recent photo of Dutch People in traditional holiday Blackface).  What the girls are wearing is called SKIN BRONZER.  They have matched the skin tone of &#8216;liii-skinndit&rsquo; Upper Middle Class &#8216;Blacks&rsquo; perfectly.  I&rsquo;d name the color &#8216;Quintessential Quadroon&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Bodybuilders have that Bronzer goop smeared all over themselves at contests (looking absolutely HORRIBLE, if you ask me).  Some seem even darker than these girls.  Has the Hurt Minority Feelings Industry demanded apologies from the (Mafia-dominated) world of Bodybuilding yet?  I mean, first these musclemen don Blackface&hellip;.or Bronzeface&hellip; and then they prance around in revealing posing suits, with their unmentionable parts shrunken to nothing by the diuretics (and the Meth so fashionable, now, for getting &#8216;ripped&rsquo;&hellip;and, of course, the Steroids). I take that sort of thing to be a Biometric Slur against Black Men&hellip;Implying that they are lacking in that department. Such mental anguish! Somebody should sue.  I hope they do.  </p>
