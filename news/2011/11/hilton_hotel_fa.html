<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=363489">Hilton Hotel Faces Protest for Hosting Muslim &#8216;Terror Co-Conspirator&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Art Moore, World Net Daily, November 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Amid threats by Muslims that have prompted hotels to cancel conferences warning of the encroachment of Islamic law in America, a group called DefendChristians.org is countering with a call to protest the Hilton Hotel in Anaheim, Calif., for hosting the annual fundraising banquet for the Los Angeles-area branch of the controversial Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>DefendAmerica.org points out that the featured speaker for CAIR-LA&rsquo;s event Saturday night is Siraj Wahhaj, who was named by the Justice Department as a possible co-conspirator in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six Americans. CAIR itself was named by the Justice Department as an &#8220;unindicted co-conspirator&#8221; in the Holy Land Foundation probe in Texas, the largest terrorism-finance case in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Wahhaj also urges the violent overthrow of the &#8220;filthy&#8221; U.S. government and the establishment of Islamic law.</p>
<p>The imam testified as a character witness for convicted WTC terrorist mastermind Omar Abdel-Rahman, known as the &#8220;blind sheik.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;CAIR is showing its true colors by aligning with such a notorious anti-American radical,&#8221; said Gary Cass of DefendChristians.Org. &#8220;We&rsquo;re shocked that the Hilton Hotel will allow such an event on their property.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cass said his group is inviting &#8220;fellow patriots&#8221; to gather at 4 p.m. Saturday in front of the Anaheim hotel to &#8220;expose the public to Hilton&rsquo;s association with CAIR and Siraj Wahhaj.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a videotaped May 8, 1992, sermon obtained by the authors of &#8220;Muslim Mafia&#8221; titled &#8220;Stand Up for Justice,&#8221; Wahhaj makes it clear that, contrary to CAIR&rsquo;s media guide, he believes jihad means &#8220;holy war,&#8221; not merely a &#8220;struggle to better oneself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we go to war, brothers and sisters  &mdash;  and one day we will, believe me  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re commanded [to fight in] jihad,&#8221; the Brooklyn-based Wahhaj says. &#8220;When Allah demands us to fight, we&rsquo;re not stopping and nobody&rsquo;s stopping us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wahhaj preaches that Islam teaches violent insurrection in &#8220;infidel lands&#8221; such as America, points out the &#8220;Muslim Mafia&#8221; co-authors, counterterrorism investigator Gaubatz and &#8220;Infiltration&#8221; author Paul Sperry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wahhaj exhorts the faithful to go into the &#8220;hood and the prisons and convert disenfranchised minorities, and then arm them and train them to carry out an Uzi jihad in the inner cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t need to arm the people with nine-millimeters and Uzis,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You need to arm them with righteousness first. And then once you arm them with righteousness first, then you can arm them [with Uzis and other weapons].&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wahhaj makes it clear, nevertheless, he sees Islam as a uniquely militant religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t have a turn-the-other-cheek philosophy&#8221; like the Christians, he says. &#8220;Allah has given us permission to fight them&#8221; so that &#8220;the word of Allah can be uppermost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wahhaj also was recorded telling New Jersey Muslims in 1992 that if only Muslims were more clever politically, they could take over the U.S. and replace its constitutional government with a caliphate, according to Islam and Middle East expert Daniel Pipes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we were united and strong, we&rsquo;d elect our own emir and give allegiance to him,&#8221; Wahhaj was quoted as saying. &#8220;[T]ake my word, if 6 to 8 million Muslims unite in America, the country will come to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Counterterrorism expert Steven Emerson obtained a video of a Wahhaj speechin Toronto Sept. 28, 1991, titled &#8220;The Afghanistan Jihad&#8221; in which the imam declared:</p>
<p>Those who struggle for Allah, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of weapons, I&rsquo;m telling you it doesn&rsquo;t matter! You don&rsquo;t need nuclear weapons or even guns! If you have faith in Allah and a knife! If Allah wants you to win, you will win! Because Allah is the only one who fights. And when his hand is over your hand. whoever is at war against my friends, I declare war on them.</p>
<p>Citing Emerson, &#8220;Muslim Media&#8221; notes Wahhaj once likened the U.S. to a trash bin and prayed it would &#8220;crumble&#8221; and be replaced by Islam.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what this country is? It&rsquo;s a garbage can,&#8221; Wahhaj said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s filthy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Those enemies of civilization should not have been allowed into our country! The 1st amendment does not required the importation of muslims any more than it requires any other form of suicide!</p>

		<p>Why not use it? Threats of violence works, because we let it work.</p>
<p>My question is this, are these hotels actually intimidated or are they just using it as an excuse to keep conservative groups out?</p>

		<p>OK, I just cancelled a stay at a Hilton in Texas (and told them why&hellip;).   Oh well, I wanted an excuse to go to the Four Seasons anyway&hellip; vastly better gym at that one&hellip;</p>

		<p>We just can&rsquo;t quite learn to use the term &#8220;SAMIZDAT&#8221; here in<br>
the US.  Get over it!  We ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet.  SAMIZDAT is where we are (leavened by the very valuable, if eroded, personal liberties evolved over centuries in Anglo-American civilization).  It may be a long while before it is impossible to hold AR Conferences in mild weather in suitable private campgrounds or even deeper in a national forest in a family friendly way.  <br>
BTW, a samizdat joke from the old USSR:  About 1975, an only child in a discreet &#8220;samizdat&#8221; apartment, asks her mother how life is different in the imperialist nations from what it is in &#8220;our socialist homeland&#8221;.   Mother replies:  &#8220;Honey, in the imperialist nations, a few people dominate the thoughts and information access of all the others. Here, it is just the opposite of that.&#8221;    <br>
Get used to it!</p>
