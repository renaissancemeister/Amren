<h1>Report: Blacks Hit by STDs More Than Whites</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynette Holloway, The Root, November 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The infection rate for sexually transmitted diseases among African Americans and Hispanics, particularly young people, continues to be greater than that of whites, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s annual report.</p>
<p>Overall, sexually transmitted diseases continue to plague the population, with 19 million new infections occurring every year  &mdash;  costing the U.S. health care system $17 billion annually, according to a report released today that tracks the three reportable diseases chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The stark results from 2010 data are as follows: While blacks represent just 14 percent of the population, they account for 35 percent of all reported chlamydia cases, nearly half of syphilis cases (48 percent) and almost three-quarters (69 percent) of gonorrhea cases. </p>
<p>Further, the syphilis rate among young black men has increased dramatically in recent years (134 percent since 2006). Other CDC data suggest that this rise is likely driven by increases among young black gay and bisexual men, the report says. {snip}</p>

<p>Locally:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/ie39M" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/ie39M</a></p>
<p>Highlights:  St. Louis is 2nd in chlamydia, 3rd in gonorrhea. </p>

<p>Official St. Louis blames the internet for our STD problems.  Strange, the internet is just as there (in fact, more so, the left keeps reminding us) for whites, yet we don&rsquo;t seem to have that kind of STD problem by and large.  I wonder what this news will do to the movement that wants to &ldquo;bridge the digital divide,&rdquo; if doing so will only lead to STDs and flash mobs. </p>

		<p>And this article follows on the heels of the one posted here yesterday about Online dating sites and that the vast majority of Whites only want to contact other Whites&hellip;</p>
<p>Now we know why! </p>
<p>Besides genetic preservation, we also don&rsquo;t have to make a trip to the clinic to be treated for embarrassing STDs. It&rsquo;s not a coincidence either that this also corresponds to the rise in HIV among blacks. </p>

<p>&#8220;Blacks Hit by STDs More Than Whites&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Note the passive construction. Not &#8220;Blacks Contract STDs More Than Whites&#8221;; instead Blacks are HIT BY these diseases more. These venereal infections apparently just swoop down out of the sky   &mdash;   like lightning bolts full of warts and pus   &mdash;   and for some reason these lightning bolts like striking African peoples more than anybody else. </p>
<p>The headline and article both imply that no action on the part of Blacks is needed to make these STDs happen; their higher rates of infection are merely random unfortunate events for which no blame could ever be assigned. And poor, longsuffering Blacks are the ones taking it on the chin, yet again. </p>
<p>It must be fun to live life with zero sense of personal responsibility, never noticing a connection between Cause and Effect. Well, except for the all nasty STDs you&rsquo;d get, I suppose. </p>

<p>Blacks have high internet usage rates due to social networking on smart phones.  So what do they do with this nearly miraculous information technology?  They organize violent, thieving &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; and arrange promiscuous unprotected sex!    </p>
<p>If you gave blacks access to Star Trek transporters, so they could visit any of the world&rsquo;s wonders at a moment&rsquo;s notice, they&rsquo;d only use them for more efficient shoplifting and for fitting more sex partners into their schedules.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Blacks hit by STDs more then whites&#8221;.</p>
<p>I love how that is phrased. Imagine this headline; &#8220;Blacks hit by lightning more then whites&#8221;.</p>
<p>The implication of the headline is that STDs are something that JUST HAPPENS to blacks, like getting hit by lightning, a fluke occurence one can&rsquo;t control, rather then being a direct and deliberate consequence of ones own choices and decisions. The linguistic gymnastics &#8220;writers&#8221; go to, to give blacks a pass for their bad behaviour never fails to amaze me.</p>

		<p>Using some white male math, I calculated that blacks are 13.6, 5.7, and 3.3 times as likely to contract chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea than the rest of the population. Bear in mind that these statistics reflect the black percentage in the population, not the black percentage of sexual activities.</p>

		<p>As an employer of Blacks in the past I can say one thing. Black men always have as an undercurrent of their daily life, promiscuous sex. Just as many Whites go to the gym or usually have hobbies etc. However a small percentage of Whites have this constant daily need to be promiscuous.. That said, I really do not blame them. They are obviously doing what their evolution is telling them to do. We must be separate, the sooner the better.</p>

		<p>In the first place, blacks are not 14% of the American population.  It&rsquo;s 12 something or other, and that&rsquo;s not 14.  When people start rounding off the number to 13, then someone else will start stating 14.<br>
Anyway, blacks have always been known to have large instances of STD&rsquo;s.  In previous eras, when people had little knowledge concerning the spread of such diseases, that&rsquo;s why many white people feared using drinking fountains and toilets after blacks.  But, of course, even if STD&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t spread that way, it&rsquo;s still unsanitary if someone puts his whole mouth over a fountain, as I once saw a little black boy do in a film.  If blacks often indulged in disgusting practices like this, no one would need the fear of STD&rsquo;s to be turned off.</p>

		<p>This is not really surprising but it&rsquo;s well worth examining some of the underlying causes. Despite the fact that it&rsquo;s considerably more subtle today, a male-dominant/male-chauvinistic attitude persists among many Black and Latino men. Many of these men feel (even if they won&rsquo;t admit it publicly) that if they have more than one woman, go out to a bar or club and take a woman home (even if it&rsquo;s only for a one-night stand),are constantly pursuing sexual relationships with women, etc. &hellip; they are, well, just being MEN. If a woman, however, does the exact same thing she is branded a whore, a slut,etc. Among most Blacks and Latinos, there certainly exists a double standard in this respect  &mdash;  so much so, in fact, that many of these women either do not question their men&rsquo;s sexual histories prior to becoming romantically or sexually involved with them. Sociocultural norms and expectations undeniably also play a key role in this. Just in case anyone doubts how real this all is let me just remind you that Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was involved in a highly-publicized extra-marital affair (which subsequently led to his wife&rsquo;s divorcing him) with a reporter from the local Telemundo network station. The reporter was almost immediately fired from her job and her career has never recovered from this scandal (she was called a &#8220;homewrecker&#8221; by many in the Latino community) but most of these very same people simply viewed Villaraigosa as the victim of an immoral and indecent woman who knowingly got involved with a married man.</p>

		<p>I agree with everything all of the other posters have said.   The media (Fox, CNN, and especially the Government itself) act as if they aren&rsquo;t responsible for the consequences of their own actions.</p>
<p>I only wish the schools would warn white kids, especially the girls about this.  Minorities are &#8220;underpriveleged&#8221;, yes, but they are also reservoirs of disease.  Then we would definitely see many fewer STDs among whites.</p>

<p>What I heard the Telemundo reporterette, Mirthala Salinas, called wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;homewrecker&#8221;, but a two-word phrase starting with the word &#8220;power&#8221;    &mdash;   the rest will get me censored.  Hey, if the moniker fits, wear it!!  No sympathy here.</p>
<p>Mirthala Salinas was being passed around by California&rsquo;s high-level Latino politicians. She was involved with former State Assembly &ldquo;Speaker&rdquo; Fabian Nunez at the same time as the mayor, also state senator, Gil Cedillo.</p>

		<p>Boy, this one&rsquo;s a real shocker!  Who&rsquo;d have ever imagined that the most libidinous, irresponsible, and low IQ minority would have the highest rate of venereal infections?</p>
<p>The government should appoint a task force, with an unlimited budget, to investigate this unfathomable anomaly.</p>
