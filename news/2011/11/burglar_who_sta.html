			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laurie Whitwell, Daily Mail (London), November 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man charged with stabbing 14-year-old Kelli O&rsquo;Laughlin to death when she interrupted a burglary in her suburban home sent taunting text messages to her mother from the girl&rsquo;s stolen cell phone, it has emerged.</p>
<p>John L. Wilson Junior was today in court charged with first-degree murder and residential burglary. He was denied bail by a judge.</p>
<p>Kelli&rsquo;s funeral took place just a few miles away at St. John of the Cross Church in Western Springs, Chicago at around the same time, with mourners lining the road as her coffin passed by.</p>
<p>It was also revealed today that a local police officer stopped Wilson Jr, who was out on parole for armed robbery when the killing took place, on the night of the murder but had no cause to arrest him.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old, whose last known address is on South Lafayette Avenue in Chicago, was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon, six days after the killing at the O&rsquo;Laughlin&rsquo;s $500,000 family home in Indian Head Park.</p>
<p>Today Judge Peter A. Felice ordered Wilson Jr, who has spent 17 years of the last two decades behind bars, be held without bond during an appearance at the Cook County courthouse in Bridgeview.</p>
<p>Wilson Jr was dressed in a grey sweatshirt that covered his arm tattoos and said nothing during the hearing, in front of a packed courthouse, the Chicago Sun Times reported.</p>
<p>Those in attendance were told how last Thursday Wilson Jr entered the O&rsquo;Laughlin&rsquo;s leafy neighbourhood and broke a dining room window of their $500,000 home with a rock wrapped in a red knit cap.</p>
<p>When popular Lyons Township High School freshman Kelli arrived home around 3.40pm, &#8216;she was confronted by John Wilson,&rsquo; Cook County State&rsquo;s Attorney Anita Alvarez said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Wilson Jr grabbed an eight inch carving knife from a butcher&rsquo;s block and stabbed Kelli in the neck, back and chest, before dragging her dead body from the family room into the kitchen, Ms Alvarez said, accordingh to the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>He then ransacked the home and fled with a bowl of coins, an iPod Touch and Kelli&rsquo;s phone. The knife was found in large pool of blood in the family.</p>
<p>She was discovered by her mother Brenda at around 5.30pm.</p>
<p>In the hours after the murder, Wilson Jr used the phone to send &#8216;taunting and disturbing&rsquo; messages to Kelli&rsquo;s mother. &#8216;There are no words to describe how horrific it is,&rsquo; Ms Alvarez said. She would not reveal the exact nature of the taunts.</p>
<p>Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Peter Troy said the messages to Kelli&rsquo;s mother Brenda came within hours of her daughter&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;A horrific crime was committed here, and then to have the mother of the victim subject to taunts by the person who did it &hellip; I can&rsquo;t describe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;To me that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a random burglary,&rsquo; Marie Raleigh told Fox News Chicago. &rsquo; I&rsquo;m a little bit concerned that someone could be so vicious and cruel as to do that to the family of this victim. Kelli didn&rsquo;t deserve that and neither did her family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;The United States Secret Service was able to track the defendant&rsquo;s cellphone and Kelli&rsquo;s cellphone,&rsquo; Mr Troy said, according to the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>&#8216;The agents learned these two phones travelled in tandem with one another throughout the city of Chicago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wilson Jr was located Wednesday on the South Side. When found, he had his phone but not Kelli&rsquo;s, the Chicago Tribune reported.</p>
<p>DNA recovered from the knit cap matched Wilson Jr, Alvarez said. Three witnesses identified Wilson in a line-up, she said.</p>
<p>Wilson Jr has an extensive history of criminal violence, including a combined nine years spent in prison for carjacking in 1993 and aggravated battery in 2001.</p>
<p>His most recently received an 11-year sentence for robbert. He was taken into custody in August 2002 and paroled on November 16, 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported.</p>
<p>It has been revealed that at around 8pm on the night of the killing, a Willow Springs police officer responding to another disturbance near the O&rsquo;Laughlin home stopped Wilson Jr.</p>
<p>He said he was walking in the area because his car had broken down and he needed a cab, leaving the officer no cause to arrest him.</p>
<p>That officer was then off work for several days, Fox News Chicago reported, and only saw the composite sketch of the suspect when he returned to service recently.</p>
<p>He reportedly identified Wilson Jr as the man in the drawing, which depicts a black man, 5&rsquo;8&#8221; to 5&rsquo;9&#8221; inches tall, with a medium build. He was was seen in the area at the time wearing a dark, hooded sweatshirt and had a backpack.</p>
<p>Police then traced the driver of the cab the suspect got into after being stopped by the officer at a 7-11 in Willow Springs, for miles from the murder scene.</p>
<p>Investigators arranged for a line-up, in which Wilson Jr was positively identified, Fox News Chicago reported.</p>
<p>The unsuspecting taxi-driver took the suspect to Midway airport where the man paid for his fare with coins. These were not the special gold coins taken from the victim&rsquo;s home however.</p>
<p>Authorities spoke positively about the investigation in a press conference on Thursday night. Sheriff Tom Dart said the case had been presented to the state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&#8216;We feel very confident about the case and the individual in custody,&rsquo; Sheriff Dart said. Indian Head Park Police Chief Frank Alonzo said: &#8216;I think we can rest a little bit easier tonight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last week, another man was questioned in connection with the murder. That man had been charged in September with another burglary in the area but was later released, the Chicago Tribune reported.</p>
<p>He was not charged over Kelli&rsquo;s killing but the original burglary charge was reinstated and he is now in Cook County Jail, the Chicago Tribue reported.</p>
<p>The murder shook Indian Head Park, a leafy community of roughly 3,800, and numerous online tribute groups attracting thousands have been set up. A memorial fund has also been started.</p>
<p>Kelli&rsquo;s father, John O&rsquo;Laughlin, said on Wednesday that family members have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support they have received.</p>

		<p>The fact he laid in wait for her shows his crime to be premedidated murder, and a murder motivated by racial hatred. This is why whites should shoot and kill ALL intruders in their homes, without exception. The fact that he taunted her mother using the dead girl&rsquo;s cell phone shows first of all he&rsquo;s a violent and dangerous dimwit, secondly he KNOWS no serious consequences will result from his act of genocide, and thirdly the lives of white children mean NOTHING in non-white dominated America. That fact better burn into the brains of younger whites if they are to have any chance to see their children grow up, let alone live to have white children of their own. </p>

		<p>Two things from this article interest me:</p>
<p>1.  This happened in South Suburban Cook, i.e. southern Cook County that is not in the City of Chicago.  It has become the &#8220;New Southside,&#8221; the new dumping grounds for Chicago&rsquo;s civic elite to cajole and encourage Chicago&rsquo;s ghetto blacks, Cabrini Green and otherwise, to relocate, in order to make the city proper safe for white yuppies.</p>
<p>See also:  Prince Georges County, Maryland, and Northern St. Louis County, Missouri.</p>
<p>2.  Mr. Wilson is listed as a &#8220;recent parolee.&#8221;  I bet one of Governor Quinn&rsquo;s infamous parolees of 2009.  As far as that goes, don&rsquo;t blame me, I voted for Bill Brady.  As did the majority of people in 99 of Illinois&rsquo;s 102 counties.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it stated somewhere in the Bible that there&rsquo;s a time to love and a time to hate? I&rsquo;m awfully tired of hearing about the latest outpourings of sympathy from whites over the latest black-on-white atrocity. What&rsquo;s really needed is a thunderous outpouring of righteous vengeance.</p>
<p>Likely this worthless thug knows of the teachings of local pastor Jeremiah Wright. GAWD, I&rsquo;m sick of this.</p>

		<p>I would be willing to bet she was also raped. Do you think that this hardened black felon would pass that opportunity up, fresh out of prison?</p>
<p>Often times the most disturbing aspects of cases like these are held back from the public, at least initially. Like the Knoxville torture murders, the true nature of this crime may only come to light over time.</p>

		<p>I remember seeing this in last weeks Chicago news.<br>
They had disguised it though and the killer wasn&rsquo;t <br>
identified as black in the news I saw&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
and there was no picture with the news story.</p>
<p>I suspected it was some crazed black, since 98% of the murders <br>
seem to be done by them</p>

		<p>And to think that it was your taxes, taken from your family, that probably paid for this low-life&rsquo;s prenatal care, birth, Pre-K daycare, Head-start, Food stamps, Section 8 housing, education, afterschool programs, bussing, free lunch, transportation, medical care, and on, and on.  </p>
<p>And how did he repay this generocity by by Whites?  by killing them and taunting them.</p>
<p>It is time to end the 60-yr free ride by Blacks, paid for by Whites.  It is time that Blacks started to take care of themselves.  Our 60 yrs of patronizing has only increased their social pathology and anger.  </p>

		<p>This is sickening. What kind of a person could murder an innocent 14 year old child in cold blood with absolutely no remorse? I wonder if the liberals who preach that diversity is our strength ever notice that you never hear of a white guy breaking into a house, assaulting and killing a 14 year old girl, then casually walking away in broad daylight? Whites often donate to charities and even take in children who need a home, blacks just rob, rape, and murder them in record numbers, yet we are equal?</p>

		<p>$500,000 is a very expensive home for the area.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a recent article posted that said a &#8220;prudent&#8221; (also very well off )White person could easily avoid blacks?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.  They drove us from the city to suburbs to farther and farther out suburbs.  Instead of giving blacks food stamps, medical care and sec 8 to breed, why not give working Whites gasoline, oil and repair stamps so they can get to work from their increasingly far off homes?</p>
<p>A lot of Chicagoans fled to the first towns over the Illinois Wisconsin line.  A railroad went directly to Milwaukee from downtown Chicago.  It was only about 30 minutes longer to get to much cheaper Wisconsin than the expensive North shore suburbs like Glencor, Highland Park, Lake Forest.</p>
<p>Then the Chicago blacks, having destroyed their Chicago neighborhoods discovered that Wisconsin had better welfare benefits and they followed the White refugees to those wonderful small Wisconsin like Kenosha cities just north of the border.</p>
<p>Within 5 years of the first Chicago blacks arrival the Kenosha schools were under control of black thugs.</p>
<p>Example of how it can be impossible to avoid blacks no matter how rich and &#8220;prudent&#8221; an aquaintance was recently raped in her gated community.  The rapist was with a gardening crew, the only black in the crew.  He worked for a short while, wandered off and raped her in her home. He confessed that he had been picked up by a hispanic gardener, name unknown with several other day laborers and brought to the gated community. </p>
<p>The gated community was in Los Angeles.  The neighborhood is known as Bel Air. </p>
<p>No matter how safe we think we are, we are not safe from blacks.</p>

		<p>I pass through Indian Head Park on my way to work each day. Nice community, probably almost all whitey or nearly so. And good schools and not wealthy folks but not poor either. This thug had to drive a considerable distance to reach the area, but distance and auto travel is no bar to the common criminal today. This girl stumbled upon the crime while in progress and killing the witness to a crime does not bring death anymore in IL as IL is not &#8220;civilized&#8221; and just did away with the death penalty [I am so glad we are so civilized now!!]. The Tribune said that this was a &#8220;Chicago man&#8221; and lived &#8220;near the Dan Ryan expressway&#8221; so you had a good idea as to the race of the thug. And my instincts and intuition were correct about this case from the start. A break in and burglary yes, but not murder unless the perp was a [you fill in the rest]. And this dope stole the rare collectible coins and used them to pay the cab fare so he was easily recognized and found out. A dope in many ways.</p>

		<p>Poster #6- I hate to think that she was raped, but it probably did happen, either before or post mortem. This is a sick disturbing part of many of these cases. My cousin is a paramedic in Cleveland, Ohio. Her husband retired from the same division. They both covered a zone in a majority black area and the depravity they&rsquo;ve seen and told to us as stories should never even be uttered from a human being&rsquo;s mouth. But it&rsquo;s that depravity that separates most Whites with the criminal element of non-white races. We, for the most part, have evolved from the sick savagery of colonial times. Although the depravity seems to fall on White liberals and their minions of excuse makers throughout.</p>

		<p>Never any rage or anger on the part of the white victims families.  Instead we get to hear of how the family has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and how Kelli and her family did not deserve this.  Is the implication that some fourteen year old school girl and their family could deserve such a fate?  White people really are the perfect victims.  No matter how egregious the outrage committed against us we will never anger and will always reach out to the perpetrator and their community.<br>
Also, if the texting taunts did not have a racial element to them and if the girl was not raped I am indeed a monkey&rsquo;s uncle.</p>

<p>Yes, in the OT; Ecclesiastes, so whether it pertains to Christians, or whites who want to survive in this world, I doubt.  But that book goes through the laundry list of earthly concerns, and then proclaims that none of them have any meaning, only God has meaning.  So whether it is a sanction for revenge, especially Christian revenge is doubtful, because in the NT we have clearly stated that revenge is for God, not man.</p>
<p>I think it is best to be a man of the world and deal with the animals who do these things to us.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a disgrace that we find out these things through European print media instead of our own.<br>
I have two problems:<br>
1. What was the motivation for mentioning twice that the victim lived in a $500,000 home? Was that an implication that this poor young girl was a privileged White girl ?<br>
2. What&rsquo;s up with the description of the area as being &#8220;leafy&#8221;. Is having lots of trees on your block an indication of White privilege as well?<br>

 In my own hometown there was a case a while back where two rough looking Hispanic types broke into an elderly couples home in the middle of the night. The man confronted them in the kitchen, asking them what they wanted, why were they inside and pleading for them to please leave immediately. His wife walked in the room and opened fire without preamble, announcement or negotiation&hellip; I believe one was killed and one in critical condition. It didn`t take talking  to neighbors long to figure out which one they thought acted in a prudent and correct fashion. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear Tim Mc Hugh who was wearing the pants in that house, and good for the lady for doing what I would ahve done, which is give them both sudden lead poisoning. After being attacked once by two blacks in my own dorm room, I vowed that if there is a next time I will shoot and keep shooting until the attacker or attackers were stone cold dead, no many how many shots I have to fire into them. This is the way whites need to be to make darkies like that child killer think twice before they commit atrocities against us, let alone each other.</p>

		<p>&#8220;1. What was the motivation for mentioning twice that the victim lived in a $500,000 home? Was that an implication that this poor young girl was a privileged White girl ?&#8221;</p>
<p>May have been.  May have been to point out that black criminals follow and prey on Whites no matter where they live or how expensive the house.<br>

<p>A gun in your purse, belt or holster is useless if you can&rsquo;t get it out in time.  If you hear an intruder and are near your gun you can look for him with the safety catch off and the gun in your hand.</p>
<p>If you come home and are surprised by an intruder you won&rsquo;t have time to pull the gun out of the purse or belt.</p>
<p>Despite all the self defence and women in the army propaganda, men are bigger and stronger than women.</p>
<p>People who live or work in dangerous neighborhoods should carry the gun in their hand down at the hip.<br>

		<p>Behold the swinging door of the Illinois Department of Corrections, as proven by John Wilson&rsquo;s felony convictions and sentences:</p>
<p>1991 Possession of controlled substance + possession of stolen vehicle: 5-year sentence</p>
<p>1993 Aggravated carjacking + possession of controlled substance: 7-year sentence</p>
<p>2001 Aggravated battery of peace officer: 2-year sentence</p>
<p>2002 Robbery of school or church: 11-year sentence</p>
<p>Note the dates and how Wilson was convicted of another felony, in most cases, before his prior sentence would have even been completed, if he hadn&rsquo;t been paroled early. And considering it takes months after an arrest before a person goes to trial in Crook County, this say a lot. Illinois has <i>effectively</i> stopped punishing criminals. </p>
<p>When the executive branch of a state no longer carries out the criminal laws enacted by the legislative branch, can&rsquo;t it honestly be said that the citizens of that state are not being afforded the republican form of government guaranteed by section 4 of the US Constitution?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not even allowed to protect ourselves by being armed outside the home.</p>

		<p>#14, Your post reminded me of a rape, a few years back, in New Orleans (pre-Katrina).  I heard about it, because the Victim&rsquo;s Daughter was a Sorority Sister of one of my Associates.</p>
<p>Magnificent house, on the grandest boulevard in town&hellip;surrounded by a high wall, and high gates&hellip;maids coming and going all day&hellip;alarm system&hellip;  </p>
<p>But a black made it in, somehow, got upstairs, and into the Master Suite&hellip;took his time, raping and beating the Lady of the House..all afternoon.  Her Daughter found the poor woman lying on the floor, unclothed, bruised, bloody&hellip; unable to move, and barely able to beg her Daughter to not let the other children see her like that.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t make any assumptions about this family.  Frankly, I have no idea whether they were liberal or naive: I doubt it, though.  You can&rsquo;t live in New Orleans for long, without becoming a Race Realist.  BUT THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE SAFE, just as probably did that woman in Bel Air.  </p>
<p>SAFE was England, before non-white immigration.  SAFE was the Midwest, when it was virtually all-white.  &#8216;Safe&rsquo; is NOT a gated community and a light-armored SUV.</p>
<p>Those wealthy who ARE liberal and naive, who have supported the Race Replacement and White Genocide, will eventually feel the effect of their own folly.  They will pay the price of &#8216;Diversity&rsquo;, just as surely as will the rest of us.</p>

		<p>black male-on-white female crimes from <b>THE PAST WEEK!
<p>Chicago:</p>
<p><i>The [black] man charged with stabbing 14-year-old Kelli O&rsquo;Laughlin to death when she interrupted a burglary in her suburban home sent taunting text messages to her mother from the girl&rsquo;s stolen cell phone, it has emerged.</i></p>
<p>New York City:</p>
<p><i>Poor, black, urban &ldquo;youths&rdquo; in New York City pushed a shopping cart off a store walkway four stories up, smashing a middle-aged White woman&rsquo;s head in, right in front of her son.  The blacks were even reported laughing about it. One supposedly said: &#8216;Whatever happens, happens.&rsquo; </i></p>
<p>South Africa:</p>
<p><i>A couple of White teenaged girls were abducted from a popular hang-out by five black males and one female. They needed some White girls for a Voodoo-like &#8216;Muti&rsquo; ceremony. They cut the arm of one girl so she would bleed on a Bible and then doused her and friend Kirsty Theologo in gasoline, setting both on-fire. Her friend broke free and rolled flaming Kirsty into the dirt. But that didn&rsquo;t save the poor girl, she died a excruciating death the next day in the hospital.</i></p>
<p><i>Another SA White girl came home from Bible study to find a black monster in her apartment. For hours he tortured her with a knife, literally dissecting pieces of her face before raping her. Leaving her for dead, the animal slipped away. She somehow survived but badly disfigured.</i> </p>
<p><i>Justice did not come, as two black police officers purposefully allowed the monster to escape from jail later.</i></p>
<p>Los Angeles:</p>
<p><i>Yesterday, Chester Turner, the Los Angeles &#8216;Southside Strangler&rsquo; was convicted of three more murders (two prostitutes and a 15 year old girl skipping school), bringing up his conviction total to 13 (cops think he murdered at least 20).</i></p>
<p>How many of these vicious, vile black-on-White murders did you read or hear about in the MSM?</p>
<p>Yet the Texas judge who dispensed tough love on his daughter for stealing got wall-to-wall coverage for two days straight.  He was White, of course.</p>

http://whitereference.blogspot.com/2007/11/final-autopsy-report-on-12-year-old.html<br>
 But local residents have stated they can&rsquo;t understand why even local media won&rsquo;t publish any updates on that case.</p>
<p>To number 11 - If it wouldn&rsquo;t prejudice the case, is it possible for you to relate the texts the family received from the killer before his capture? Were there any racial taunts?</p>
<p>To number 17 - Is it possible for you to write up some of the firsthand reports you had of Black atrocities related to you by your Paramedic cousin? As bad as it would sound, its time people knew the truth behind the news, what really goes on in these &#8216;racially deprived&rsquo;, &#8216;economically depressed&rsquo; areas.<br>

		<p>Thank you, Brian (#40) for that update on the Emily Elizabeth Haddock case.  I had followed the link on this thread, and then googled around, trying to find any later articles.  NOTHING!  What on earth were people threatened with, to keep this so quiet?  And what happened to the Perps?  Anyway, it&rsquo;s good to hear that this child was not raped or tortured.</p>
<p>I agree with you, that detailed accounts of what the Paramedic Cousin of #14 witnessed would be enlightening.  We need to know.</p>
<p>Oh, and Nancy, many people have no money left for security systems, after paying the mortgage notes on the expensive houses they HAVE TO BUY, in order to live in &#8220;Leafy&#8221; neighborhoods, where they hope their children will be safe from being brutalized AT SCHOOL.  I know plenty of people who are eating on a Dollar a day per-person, shivering in Winter, sweltering in Summer&hellip;almost starving, and barely using their Central Air&hellip;people talking on twelve-year-old Cell Phones&hellip;people who cannot afford Internet in their homes&hellip; people who have Great-Grandma&rsquo;s grotesque &#8216;Early American&rsquo; laminate-topped Particle Board furniture in a few rooms of their vast and otherwise unfurnished &#8216;French&rsquo; homes, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MONEY LEFT, once they&rsquo;ve paid the notes.  The prices of the tickets into these &#8220;Leafy&#8221; oases of whiteness are steep.</p>
<p>My own family is lucky to have a new Lexus in every bay of our Garage. And we&rsquo;re lucky to have inherited enough of the Nineteenth Century Brahmin furniture from our families&rsquo; long-lost plantation homes, to furnish our own half-empty McMansion. I&rsquo;m a farm girl who knows how to sew, and so am able to recycle cast-off Scalamandre Brocade draperies I spot at &#8216;elite&rsquo; thrift stores.  So, our windows, unlike those of others, are not uncovered. Double-interlined Curtains save us plenty on electric bills.  And I can still afford to buy our six fruits and vegetables a day&hellip;Organic, even. But we have a waiting list of people desperate to buy our cars, when we&rsquo;re through with them. When we &#8216;allocate&rsquo; a used Lexus, we feel like Schindler agonizing over his list of people to help. These are people with advanced degrees, living in four and six hundred thousand Dollar homes&hellip;people who took their last pleasure trip a decade back&hellip;people who have stopped putting up holiday decorations&hellip; who no longer entertain or go to Church or get Cable or Periodicals&hellip; who haven&rsquo;t been to the Dentist in a decade&hellip; to the Doctor in years&hellip; all to be able to CLING&hellip; just barely&hellip; to ownership of homes in enclaves where their children, hopefully, will be safe.  And these are the &#8216;lucky&rsquo;, two-income families.  The Diversity-driven financial desperation of much of today&rsquo;s White America is a largely-untold story.</p>

<p><a href="http://goo.gl/KqYZE" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/KqYZE</a></p>
<p> The Police even here in New Zealand warn people not to interfere in pack burglaries in particular, because the perps won&rsquo;t run as they did once upon a time.

		<p>#37 Bob:</p>
<p>Excellent article from your link on the Frankfurt School, everyone should read it to get an idea of what has been foisted on us by this duplicitous group.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>The Frankfurt School set in motion what it called a &#8216;quiet revolution&rsquo; on the American people designed to <i>de-stabilize society and bring down what they saw as the &lsquo;oppressive&rsquo; order.&rsquo; Their policies, they hoped, would spread like a virus&hellip; a long-term project&hellip; focused on the family, education, media, sex and popular culture.</i></p>
<p>Important tenants are:</p>
<p>* The creation of racism offenses.</p>
<p>*The teaching of sex and homosexuality to children</p>
<p>*The undermining of schools&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; authority</p>
<p>*Huge immigration to destroy identity.</p>
<p>*The promotion of excessive drinking</p>
<p>* Dependency on the state or state benefits</p>
<p>*Encouraging the breakdown of the family</p>
<p><i>One of the main ideas of the Frankfurt School was to exploit Freud&rsquo;s idea of &lsquo;pansexualism&rsquo; - the search for pleasure, the exploitation of the differences between the sexes, the overthrowing of traditional relationships between men and women. To further their aims they would:</i></p>
<p>• attack the authority of the father, deny the specific roles of father and mother, and wrest away from families their rights as primary educators of their children. </p>
<p>• abolish differences in the education of boys and girls</p>
<p>• abolish all forms of male dominance - hence the presence of women in the armed forces </p>
<p>• declare women to be an &lsquo;oppressed class&rsquo; and men as &lsquo;oppressors&rsquo;<br>
Munzenberg summed up the Frankfurt School&rsquo;s long-term operation thus: &lsquo;We will make the West so corrupt that it stinks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Your article beautifully sums up the evil veil that has descended upon Western culture and societies, enslaving us in a PC reign of terror, foisted upon us by the treacherous Frankfurt School.</p>
<p>Even Hitler considered The Frankfurt School evil and sent them packing:</p>
<p><i>The Nazis perceived the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research as a communist organization and closed it within six weeks of Hitler&rsquo;s ascent to power because it had &lsquo;encouraged activities hostile to the state.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>They relocated to the United States and we&rsquo;ve been paying the price ever since.  Is this HItler&rsquo;s revenge?</p>

<p>That is the story of all these expensive White suburbs.  I live in Marin county.  I turned off the gas 15 years ago.  We face north into a redwood canyon.  It&rsquo;s 50 degrees 5 months of the year.  I have an electric stove and water heater.  My furniture was all bought from second hand stores. All my clothes are second hand. We haven&rsquo;t been to a dentist for 15 years.  I can barely afford Christmas cards and stamps.</p>
<p>All to keep my children safe.</p>
<p>The worst thing is that even if we can afford the house when we move in, the property taxes go up and up every year. Between the property tax to keep our children safe and the gas and other commuting expenses which I call the work tax, my after tax and commuting take home is less than I would have were I on welfare.</p>

<p>The books are, &#8220;Revolution and Counter-Revolution&#8221; by Plinio Correra de Oliveira, and &#8220;From Liberation Theology to the New Eco-Feminist Theology&#8221; by Juan Antonio Montes Varras. </p>

		<p>Brian!  You are the king of the Googlers!  Thank you for that update on what happened to the murderers of Emily Elizabeth Haddock (far too little happened to them, IMHO).</p>
<p>#45, I know what you are going through.  Around here, the new convention, upon giving a gift, or doing a favor is to say, &#8220;And don&rsquo;t you DARE send me a Thank You Note.&#8221;  The price of postage now equals a meal.  BTW, our water heaters have never been lit, nor the Gas turned on. Gas meters are being removed all over our &#8216;rich&rsquo; County, as people discover they can, somehow, live without heat/hot water/dish washers. We shower at the Gym, and if it&rsquo;s closed, heat water by taking containers up to the highest attic, where they will heat naturally.  We&rsquo;ve taught our neighbors that trick, and others have simply put tanks in the attic, or rigged crude solar water heaters.  Others are heating their houses with nothing more than big water-filled Stock Pots kept on their electric stoves, set on &#8216;2&rsquo;(very low) (Radiant Heat on-the-cheap).  When Air Conditioning Compressors give out, there are people living in just the portions of their homes that they can (halfway) cool with those little hundred-Dollar window units. These people are keeping their electric bills well below $100. People are beginning to landscape with Blueberries, Pomegranates, Figs (you can eat the leaves), edible Alliums&hellip; Yesterday, I heard, &#8220;If you get a white car, you can run the AC a lot less, and it&rsquo;ll save you a couple Dollars in gas, every month.  And if you can&rsquo;t afford to fix the AC, it&rsquo;s bearable.&#8221;  But behind all this thrift is the terror of not having enough&hellip;after all the Pennies have been pinched&hellip; that there may not be enough money for the payments, the taxes, the premium we pay to live safely away from (the worst of) THEM. I wish you the best of luck.</p>
<p>BOB and BON, thank you for the information on the FRANKFURT SCHOOL. First I&rsquo;d heard of it, but their script meshes so well with the interests of so many groups envious of America and the Western Democracies.  What the Frankfurt School did, essentially, was to purposely invent a sort of SOCIETAL CANCER&hellip; or maybe something analogous with the fictional virus which turns Humans into flesh-eating Zombies.  Anyway, they designed something which is self-replicating and unspeakably evil.</p>

<p>The bible does say that, HOWEVER it is not referring to people hating each other. Remember that Jesus said the most important Christian principles are to love God above all else, and secondly, to love one another. We are not supposed to hate OR judge anyone EVER.</p>
<p>There are also verses telling that in the times before the end, Christians will lose their compassion. I don&rsquo;t see this as a result of Christians being bad, but instead, from us being &#8216;fed up&rsquo;. I think the powers that be are CAUSING this, by not enforcing laws, not punishing anyone and if your area is like here in the Midwest, letting child rapists roam free after a slap on the hand. <br>
Yes, we&rsquo;re getting closer to the time of Jesus&rsquo; return.<br>
I think, like all other countries in this world, we should have strict laws that enforce peace. Those who wish to violate that law do not belong in a peaceful society- and the fact that the peaceful man should financially support the violent people is insane, but that is where we are today.<br>
Things will not improve, but will continue to rapidly decline until we GET AND ENFORCE tough laws.<br>
I also imagine this pathetic excuse for a human being raped that poor girl before killing her. I feel bad for her family and I wish there was some contact information posted to support them.</p>
