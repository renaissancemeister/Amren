<h1><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Wisconsin-Lawmakers-Consider/129623/">Wisconsin Lawmakers Consider Eliminating Race as Factor in College-Grant Program</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brenda Medina, Chronicle of Higher Education, November 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Wisconsin lawmakers are debating a controversial plan to remove race as a factor that can qualify students for a state program that provides grants for college. The proposal received preliminary approval on Wednesday from the Wisconsin State Assembly.</p>
<p>{snip} Supporters of the proposal said that race should not influence who is eligible for need-based financial aid. Democrats who opposed the plan called it &#8220;an affront to minority rights,&#8221; the AP reported.</p>
<p>The legislation would make changes in the Talent Incentive Program Grant, a $4.4-million program that awards $600 to $1,800 grants to students from low-income and nontraditional backgrounds who attend college in Wisconsin. Nontraditional students include students who are black, Hispanic, Hmong, or American Indian; who are among the first generation of their families to attend college; or who have been in prison. {snip}</p>

		<p>Kudos to Wisconsin.  The Repubs take over and right away they take the public employee unions down a peg regarding Collective Bargaining.  Now they are attempting to put some common sense in which students get financial aid.  Why should some students get aid just because of their race?   Shouldn&rsquo;t the student&rsquo;s situation and needs be taken into consideration?  And, I don&rsquo;t think such considerations are an affront to anyone&rsquo;s rights.</p>

		<p>Grants should be based upon one thing &amp; one thing only, academic achievement. Race &amp; socioeconomic status should never enter into the picture. Doing so, means a lot of unqualified, underserving students are attending college who more than likely shouldn&rsquo;t be there in the first place. They&rsquo;re also more than likely to drop or flunk out which means tax dollars wasted for no good reason. As far as prison, ex-cons should be required to pay back the cost of incarceration &amp; rehab instead of getting grants to go to college. What nonsense!</p>

		<p>Now watch the American &#8220;Civil Liberties&#8221; Union or some other group that advocates exclusively for non-whites sue to block any progress. &#8220;No, we must not move forward into the the 21st century!&#8221;<br>
I wonder if we&rsquo;ll see a repeat of the brilliant arguments we saw in Michigan: &#8220;Not discriminating by race is racist!&#8221;  So which liberal judge will preside over that hearing?</p>

		<p>Some months ago I happened to catch an old movie TCM starring Betty Davis called &#8220;The Corn is Green.&#8221; She plays a school marm in a small coal mining town in Wales who takes a special interest in a young student of outstanding abilities, but who comes from a poor background. She cares about all of her students, but can recognize great potential when she sees it. The movie was like a breath of fresh air. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an old lady now, but when I was growing that&rsquo;s what I understood scholarships to be. They were for poor students who had great abilities, but not the means to go to college. </p>

		<p>Interestingly, it was white Democratic Assemblywoman Krusick who introduced the measure.  Several Black Democrats denounced the proposal, complaining it would end affirmative action.  Today police had to escort Krusick out of a Democratic policy meeting, while white Leftists demanded that she be kicked out of the party.  Even Democratic leaders had to plead with the Leftists (some of whom stalked Republican lawmakers earlier in the year) to stop shouting so the caucus could continue its discussions.  For months, Left-wing mobs have obstructed the democratic process in Wisconsin.  One expects no quick change in scholarships - but it was a pleasant surprise to see the legislature debate the end of anti-white discrimination in one area.</p>

<p>What exactly does the writer mean by &#8220;controversial&#8221;? That&rsquo;s a blatant attempt to mark the effort as bad, or ugly, or wrong - what an awful piece of journalism.</p>
<p>What should be controversial is throwing money away on incompetents based only on skin color. </p>
<p>We have a lot of work left to do.</p>

<p>Or at least make the prisoners work their tails off in prison like they made them do down South.  They should be working for free while in prison and making good quality products for society.</p>

<p>Except, the program already dropped race as a factor under Jim Doyle&rsquo;s administration.  Try again.</p>

		<p>Poster #1 I must respectfully disagree with your statement that ex cons should have to pay for their own incarceration. Not everyone who ends up in the penal system is a worthless criminal. For example I know someone who shot a robber who actually threatened him with a knife. He went to prison for 3 years. Any self respecting man would have done the same thing when a man brandishing a knife approached and demanded money. Federal inmates do more than enough to pay for their crimes, just look into prison industry. In some areas inmates are building sophisticated military equipment for less than a dollar an hour.</p>

<p>Take a glance at this story:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/56njc" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/56njc</a></p>
<p>It admits that they never expect to collect those 143 clams a day from the typical worthy that spends time in Riverside County jails (According to my sources, the Inland Empire is getting more and more black and Hispanic by the year).  What they want is to be able to slap liens on the real estate of the few inmates that do own real estate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.  The whole concept is 3.1415926-in-the-sky silliness on the part of politicians who thinks it sounds cute and clever.</p>

		<p>Go, Wisconsin! Let&rsquo;s bring back efficiency and excellnce as standards rather than continuing this line we have developed of letting race determine who gets what. Brains, critical thinking, intelligence and &#8220;true&#8221; test scores should be the determining factor on grants, scholarships and entrance to higher level institutions. If students cannot develop thinking skills in public schools, then they don&rsquo;t want to do anything in college, but party. </p>

<p>Not even this is free from the leftist PC brigade. Take a look at what changes were made for the Broadway musical. Thankfully it flopped.</p>

		<p>The grants should be allocated based upon ability and need&hellip; nothing more.      <br>
              <br>
Affirmative action had reached the point of minimal returns many years ago.  We are now simply wasting our time, money, talent and resources by letting this dumb policy continue. </p>
