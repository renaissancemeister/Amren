			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Wolfgang, Washington Times, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. students are making progress in reading and math, but the advances continue to be clouded by stubbornly high gaps between scores for white children and their black and Hispanic counterparts, according to a major new survey Tuesday from the National Center for Education Statistics.</p>
<p>The survey measuring fourth- and eighth-grade scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) standardized tests found significant progress for both grade levels in mathematics and a slight improvement among eighth-grade readers. Reading scores among fourth graders, however, remained flat on the study&rsquo;s 500-point scale  &mdash;  and the results leave America&rsquo;s schools far behind the universal proficiency goals set by the 2002 No Child Left Behind law.</p>
<p>Since 1990, when the first NCES standardized tests were administered, scores for all ethnic groups have risen dramatically, but white students have remained far ahead. White fourth-graders scored an average of 249 points on math tests, while Hispanic students trailed at 229 points and black children were even further behind, coming in at 224 points on average.</p>
<p>The gulfs only widened by eighth grade, with black students 31 points behind and Hispanic children 23 points back, according to NCES.</p>
<p>On reading exams, the ethnic gaps topped 20 points in both grade levels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new results come at a time when congressional leaders are crafting bills to replace the decade-old No Child Left Behind law. One proposal, drafted by Sen. Tom Harkin, Iowa Democrat, and Sen. Michael B. Enzi, Wyoming Republican, would limit federal involvement to only the bottom 5 percent of schools and the 5 percent with the greatest achievement gaps between ethnic groups.</p>
<p>But some believe Tuesday&rsquo;s report demonstrates that achievement gaps remain a serious problem in more than just 5 percent of schools, and are urging lawmakers to keep strict federal accountability standards in place for all districts.</p>

		<p>My daughter brought home the annual NC School report card for her High School today that includes student performance grouped by gender and ethnicity, and of course there are no surprises.</p>
<p>End of Course passing scores are as follows for her school:</p>
<p>Whites: 81.7%<br>
Blacks: 60.6%<br>
Hispanics: 73.5%</p>
<p>District wise:</p>
<p>Whites 91.4%<br>
Blacks: 69.3%<br>
Hispanics 74.5% </p>
<p>Number of criminal acts or violence: 3</p>
<p>This is from a small, mostly rural county where there is plenty of economic hardship for White folk, I might add. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve taught black and latino children for over ten years.  I am sorry to say that white and jewish liberals are one of the primary causes of that cohort not getting a proper education.  Forget about I.Q. discussion for a moment.</p>
<p>These social justice leftists are so paternalistic (and maternalistic) it isn&rsquo;t even funny.  Remember these are the &#8220;everybody&rsquo;s a winner&#8221; people, and they have been given COMPLETE control over the education of latino and black kids.  (Every little thing their students do, even if it is really miserable work, they get praised for it!  &#8220;Oh Dequan!  Look at that three sentence &#8216;essay&rsquo;!  You&rsquo;re such a great writer!&#8221;)</p>
<p>These leftists are trying to make inroads into white schools to dumb everything down into &#8216;feel good&#8221; and &#8220;whitey is bad&#8221; lessons, but enough whites resist to make their efforts negligible.</p>
<p>So these &#8216;peace corp in America&rsquo; types perform all their experiemnts in the urban areas in black and brown classrooms. </p>
<p>The &#8216;project-based learning&rsquo; is nothing but crayons, markers and poster boards for high schoolers to pretend they&rsquo;re doing some learnin&rsquo;.  The goofy little exercises like &#8216;jigsaw&rsquo; or &#8216;station&rsquo; activities are so inane as to be unbelievable.  The use of &#8216;technology&rsquo; is laughable&hellip; You gotta&rsquo; see what some of these kids are asked to do.  (My seven year old does more than high schoolers on her own!)</p>
<p>White leftist teachers always talk about &#8216;chunking&rsquo; the texts (dumbing it down into disconnected snippets) or &#8216;differentiation&rsquo; (which is preparing 3 sets of work for a class: hard, medium and brain-dead, and giving them out accordingly).</p>
<p>I could go on forever, but you get the point.  Shaniqua and Pablo ain&rsquo;t learnin&rsquo; because the teachers are all self-esteem social justice leftists who don&rsquo;t know much about the subjects they teach, and don&rsquo;t believe that their black and brown charges need or want to learn &#8216;dead white male&rsquo; knowledge.  Such arrogance and educational malpractice!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a pattern there, like no matter what you do Whites score better than mestizos who in turn score better than blacks, almost as if race could be a factor.<br>

		<p>I should have posted the school report card from my sons Elementary school, as the results are even more bleak. Passing scores for both reading and math:</p>
<p>Whites: 80.1%<br>
Blacks: 33.3%<br>
Hispanics: 53.3%</p>
<p>I just wonder how frustrated thoes teachers are?<br>

 I have a three-word comment. &#8220;Bush was delusional.&#8221;<br>
Somehow, he thought that he could gain the everlasting<br>
support of ethnics and other liberals by promulgating<br>
this insanity. Instead, he left office with an approval<br>
rating of 24% and his brainchild is about to have a<br>
long-overdue demise. </p>

		<p>When I was a boy I had a kitten.  I taught her to play catch and hide and go seek.  Never saw another cat do those things things, although I am sure they are out there.  Much easier to teach a dog those games, they are just naturally better suited to it.  But I suppose someone could spend thosands of hours trying to trains cats those tricks.  But is it worth it?  Is it worth spending a fortune to teach blacks arithmetic to find the two or three who can divide?</p>

		<p>No one but a huckster for Charles Atlas pretends that it is possible to take a sickly, fifteen year old &#8220;ninety-seven pound weakling,&#8221; and turn him into an award winning athlete. Nevertheless, if the vast majority of students do not achieve &#8220;proficiency,&#8221; teachers are blamed, and often fired.<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, beyond the city limits of Lake Wobegon it is not true that &#8220;all the children are above average.&#8221; No Child Left Behind makes teachers even less willing to teach the illegitimate children of the under class in inner city schools than they used to be. It expects teachers to get the same results they could get with upper middle class kids trying to get into the college of their choices, and punishes them if they fail to achieve the impossible. <br>
 <br>
No Child Left Behind has George W. Bush&rsquo;s finger prints on it, so it cannot be blamed entirely on the Democrats, but it is a Democrat kind of mistake. <br>
 <br>

 <br>
&#8220;specific policies based on premises that conflict with scientific truths about human beings tend not to work. Often they do harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;One such premise is that the distribution of innate abilities and propensities is the same across different groups.&#8221;</p>

The problem is not &#8220;liberals&#8221; or any such nonsense - you sound like a talk-radio movement &#8220;conservative.&#8221; While liberal/left tactics may indeed exacerbate the problem on certain levels, the real problem is the race/IQ connection - period! </p>
<p>I suggest you read up on the works of Phillipe Rushton, Glayde Whitney, Hernstein &amp; Murray, etc. </p>
<p>The politics are symptomatic of the overriding problem - and that problem is RACE!</p>

		<p>As a reformed race denier (don&rsquo;t ask me why, I just stopped drinking the Kool-Aid one day), I have to say I am terrified by liberal denial: </p>
<p>it would be one thing if educators discussed black and Hispanic mental limitations candidly amongst themselves and then spoke in euphemisms in public.</p>
<p>This is not the case:</p>
<p>even the most seasoned (and disappointed) teacher would face a firing squad before confiding in a close friend or spouse:</p>
<p>&#8220;After 30 years of trying to teach blacks and browns, I have to say, they really are hopelessly stupid. This social experiment is doomed. We have wasted trillions of dollars for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>That blacks and browns are not very bright is not the fundamental issue.</p>
<p>Politically correct denial is.</p>

<p>So, back to the statistics website</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinestatbook.com/chapter6/areas_normal.html" rel="nofollow">https://onlinestatbook.com/chapter6/areas_normal.html</a></p>
<p>using applet &#8220;Calculate X for a given Area&#8221;  to calculate, what is the supposed IQ of those, who didn&rsquo;t pass the text. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume the mean values for Whites 100, Blacks 85 and Hispanics 90, with standard deviation 15 points for all three groups.</p>
<p>From the above posting about kids passing the test:</p>
<p>Whites: 81.7% - means those under IQ 86 failed<br>
Blacks: 60.6% - means those under IQ 81 failed<br>
Hispanics: 73.5% - means those under IQ 81 failed.</p>
<p>Makes sense, no? I read somewhere that the US Army does not take people under 85 points&hellip;</p>

		<p>The failure of No Child Left Behind to reduce the race gap in performance, or to significantly raise average scores across the board provides fresh evidence for the assertions in &#8220;The Bell Curve.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
In Charles Murray&rsquo;s more recent book, &#8220;Real Education: Four Simple Truths for Bringing American Schools Back to Reality,&#8221; He argues that most Americans learn as much as they are able to learn, and that most spend more years in school than they are able to benefit from. </p>

		<p>Here in Cupertino, CA, there is a gap between whites and Asians (both South Asians and East Asians). White kids are seen as &#8216;slow&rsquo; and &#8216;slackers&rsquo; in comparison to the high achieving, studious Asian kids. Yet, I don&rsquo;t see ANYONE trying to close the gap by offering special programs for whites. </p>

		<p>American schools are often chastised for performing less well than schools in other countries. Nevertheless, in every single country that out performs the United States, the student population is overwhelmingly white or East Asian. <br>
 <br>
What surprises me is that with a large third world population the United States out performs many countries where the vast majority of the population is still white. This includes Germany and Denmark in reading and science.<br>

Rather than criticize American public schools for failing to achieve the impossible, we should praise them for achieving what they do achieve, while increasing school discipline in the inner city schools where it is badly needed. </p>

<p>Just where did this come from Englemmann?  </p>
<p>For someone who considers himself so well informed, you are ignorant of the fact that over the last 40 years the courts and NAACP ACLU ADL SPLC National Lawyers Guild and hundreds of federally funded children&rsquo;s legal defense groups have made it illegal to discipline a black or hispanic in any way shape or form.</p>

		<p>What if all the time, money, and energy being put into the pointless task of bringing up black and mestizo scores was put into raising the scores of white boys  &mdash;  -what would happen? Remember we are, whether we like it or not (mostly not) in a multi-racial, multi-cultural nation, God help us. We are competing. We cant take solace in being higher than blacks/mestizoes, that is insane. We cant be the nurturer care-taker,loving mother giver goddess of the minorities anymore. We have to compete  &mdash;  and WIN! We must worry about the gap in front of us:Asians and Jews. Not those behind us. </p>

		<p>California teachers association has just sent out a  4th to 7th grade new guide teachers are supposed to squeeze in between language and math classes.</p>
<p>It a guide to discussing occupy wall street.  It was created at the education department at St. Cloud university in Minn, a bastion of educational nonsense, thought control,  anti White racism and marxism.</p>
<p>It is the usual, role playing, group discussions, all to turn non Whites against America and Whites.  The pictures show no Whites in the occupy wall street protests, just non Whites.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t read, can&rsquo;t count let alone add and subtract, but have the below 80 IQ 10 year olds discuss occupy wall street.</p>

		<p>The fallacy that &#8216;all races possess equal intelligence&rsquo; is the basis for blaming &#8216;racism&rsquo; for failure.  For decades, the sub-races have been told that they are equal to Caucasians.  Yet they have not been able to attain parity.  Why not?  How can this be?  If we are all equal, how can there be such disparity?  There must be some unseen force at work that is keeping them down.  That &#8216;force&rsquo; has to be racism.  It is the only plausible conclusion.  Moreover, it is a reason that can neither be proven or dis-proven.  It is a perpetual excuse.</p>

<p>I dream that someday responsible White People will have their own homeland totally free from &#8220;diversity&#8221; and the lies that so unfairly involve them in the terrible waste of trying to raise the irresponsible, the criminal, the non-achievers, which have become nothing but shackles and stumbling blocks and millstones around the White Man&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Just imagine what then might be accomplished!</p>

&ldquo;Rather than criticize American public schools for failing to achieve the impossible, we should praise them for achieving what they do achieve, while increasing school discipline in the inner city schools where it is badly needed. &ldquo;</p>
<p>Just where did this come from Englemmann?</p>
<p>For someone who considers himself so well informed, you are ignorant of the fact that over the last 40 years the courts and NAACP ACLU ADL SPLC National Lawyers Guild and hundreds of federally funded children&rsquo;s legal defense groups have made it illegal to discipline a black or hispanic in any way shape or form.<br>

If it has become illegal to discipline black and Hispanic students, why are they more likely to be disciplined than whites and Orientals?<br>

I think there should be even more discipline for trouble making blacks and Hispanics. Fortunately, decisions forced by the NAACP, ACLU ADL, SPLC and similar organizations can be reversed. </p>

		<p>When scores for blacks, browns, and whites see &#8220;significant progress&#8221; yet the gap still stubbornly persists, this suggests to me that the curriculum has been dumbed down.  Dumbing down the curriculum so that black and brown scores can increase will have the undesired effect of elevating the scores of whites as well.  IQ differences being what they are, in my opinion the only way to eliminate the dastardly achievement gap is to dumb down the curriculum so far that even blacks can&rsquo;t help but receive perfect scores, matching the perfect scores that browns and whites will also get.</p>

		<p>I teach in Los Angeles and the students are thoroughly hostile toward the school environment.  Every single appropriate student behavior must be compelled against the student&rsquo;s will.  Students simply refuse to stop talking, refuse to pay attention, refuse to do assignments in class or as homework.  They fight against every aspect of schooling and fall behind accordingly.  The district further confuses these families by promoting students to the next grade level even if they have failed all their classes.  This is never ever addressed when it comes to throwing more money at the situation. They  get out exactly what they put into school&hellip;very little.  </p>

		<p>Here is more news from the lack of education press.  You realize that this has nothing to do with the invasion of hispanic indians with average IQs of 82.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more jobs for the lads as they say in England.  More jobs for White hating marxist White women and illiterate blacks and hispanics. They don&rsquo;t need to read to get goverment affirmative action jobs so why bother?</p>
<p>Nation&rsquo;s Reading Crisis Continues! Most Kids Functionally Illiterate!<br>
 Nov. 4, 2011 | Bruce Deitrick Price<br>
(SUMMARY: New test scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress reveal that two-thirds of American kids are effectively illiterate. Two-thirds! New policies  &mdash;  and new experts  &mdash;  are needed.)   &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;   The new National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures show that only 35% of our younger students are &#8220;proficient&#8221; in reading, and only slightly more are &#8220;proficient&#8221; in math. That word suggests a low standard. In any case, these statistics are screaming the real news: roughly TWO-THIRDS of American 10-year olds are effectively illiterate; and they can&rsquo;t do much in math either. </p>

<p>Because they are disciplined far, far less than they would be were it not for the federal mandates that forbid discipline commensurate with the amount of offenses.  Whites get suspended for smoking at the bus stop.  Blacks can assault and grievously injure teachers and fellow students and nothing is done.</p>
<p>NAACP has filed lawsuits in several jurisdictions demanding that for every black suspended a White be suspended.  Soon the judges will rule in the NAACP&rsquo;s favor as they always do.</p>
