<h1>Minority Support May Boost Obama in 2012, Despite Economy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Danielle Kurtzleben, U.S. News, November 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Economics may be priority one in the 2012 presidential election, but the people who are voting matter, too. That is one conclusion from a new report that predicts that Election Day 2012 will be a &#8220;showdown&#8221; between demographics and economics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Path to 270,&#8221; a report released today from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, says that a sagging economy and an enthusiastic Republican base could wipe out President Obama&rsquo;s incumbency advantage in the 2012 presidential race. However, the president could maintain an advantage due to substantial support among several demographic groups, particularly the fast-growing Hispanic population.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, the state of the economy, writ large, is the biggest factor in favor of the GOP candidate, whoever that might be&hellip; .   That&rsquo;s the biggest thing the Republicans have going for them,&#8221; said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and the Center for American Progress and one of the study&rsquo;s authors, at a panel discussion today. &#8220;On the other hand, the demographic shifts in this country &hellip; are very much in favor of Democrats and will help Obama in the 2012 election.&#8221;</p>
<p>A look at 2008 shows that the president had the support of 80 percent of minorities and only a four-point disadvantage among white college graduates. Meanwhile, among the white working class, Republicans had an 18-point advantage. But the minority share of voters is projected to have grown by 2 percent from 2008 to 2012, and growth among white college graduates is projected at 1 percent, whereas the white working-class share of the electorate is projected to shrink by 3 percent.</p>
<p>According to the report, even if white working-class voters support the GOP presidential candidate by a 30-point margin, as they did Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, the president can still win the popular vote if he retains his support among white college graduates.</p>

		<p>      I have been saying for a while that there is a good chance the anointed one will return to office in 2012 . In my laymen&rsquo;s opinion, 99.9% of those who voted for him will vote for him again .</p>
<p>     You&rsquo;ve got to remember that something like 51% of the nation is on government relief of some type . They will vote for the incumbent . They know that they have his ear to a large degree . And as said in the article, they are coming into the nation daily . In fact, were it not for changing demographics he would have never been elected Senator much less President . </p>
<p>   <br>
     Plus, if the lib-dems get their way - felons will have the vote . This should not be construed as support for the Republicans as they are just another shade of liberal . But for a white to vote Democrat is just plain insanity .</p>

		<p>Well, of course the First Nitwit will be re-elected. Blacks have never been ones to assign responsibility to themselves or any other member of their annoited race. Color ALWAYS trumps every other issue. It&rsquo;s not that they don&rsquo;t see the guilt of other blacks; they simply don&rsquo;t CARE. They see laws as a creation of  whites, thus they actually cheer any blacks&rsquo; &#8216;victory over the white man.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Why is this &#8220;fast-growing&#8221; Hispanic population so often cited in articles such as these? It is hardly a secret that the majority of these late-arriving &#8220;immigrants&#8221;(aka Invaders) are in this country illegally, and thus inelligable to vote! Or&hellip;are they tacitly admitting that many of these illegal invaders ARE in point of fact voting already? </p>
<p>Just goes to show how brazen the Left and non-Whites in general really have become.    </p>

		<p>Obama will end up losing the latino vote because they are disgusted with him concerning the number of deportations that has happened since he took office. Since they will not vote Republican, they will just stay home.</p>

<p>A-Ha! Classic Racism. So even if a black or non white American man/ woman had all the requisites and credentials,no matter how worthy he/she would be, according to the dictum of white supremacism ( which masquerades as &#8220;nationalism&#8221; for good PR purposes) he/she would still be rejected from any office of higher ranking. That is why we liberals are far more rational and sane than you folks. Don&rsquo;t blame me, you stated the obvious or shall I say, a Freudian slip. Oops!</p>

		<p>Mindless whites who vote according to the image that is put in their minds by the perverse and deviant media and Hollywood,are whom put obama in.They remind me so much of Barney Fife after he has seen on of those G-Man, Glen Ford movies.They think that they are so hip, cool,chic, and intellectual,when they support obama.Like ole Barney thought he was a super lawman.Most of them wouldn&rsquo;t do the things they do or purport to like what they say they like or think if they didn&rsquo;t see it on television or in the movies.Try to reason with them if you can, and point these things out.Those things and scenario&rsquo;s are written and staged, they are not reality. I believe that our lives and race depend on us being able to discern the difference!!!!!</p>

		<p>This is really a no-brainer.  Certainly the majority of Blacks will vote for Obama.  He&rsquo;s their best chance at continuing the welfare state that will enable his brothers and sisters to sit on their big Black butts and do nothing.  Jobs?  They don&rsquo;t want no jobs.  They want handouts.  Most of them believe all Obama&rsquo;s shortcomings are the work of evil White Tea Party people holding him down just as they believe thier collective shortcomings are Whitey&rsquo;s fault.  This is what they&rsquo;ve been taught, by Whitey.</p>

		<p>Well hell after Newt showed his true red colors to furthur confuse and decieve white voters who can blame them? </p>
<p>Now the media snakes are starting to hype the mutt messiah again and this is growing like an avalanche. </p>
<p>The control of the mass media teaches whites how to think and what to do as usual. Just the existence of multiple white female lover Cain proves that. We know of at least 5 white females Cain went after but we also know thats just the tip of the iceberg and we dont know how many he was successful with and actually gave oral sex to and more in his car or office etc in an abuse of authority and just because thats what they want worst than anything in this world.<br>
Tiger Woods had 150 white onlys didnt he? Why no black females? They are all identical with the same genetics. Believe it. Its a fact.<br>
And you think somebody didnt know what they doing to have come up with the black slave deal 500 yrs ago? Are you kidding? </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;but the people who are voting matter too&#8221;.  Really.  <br>
Ya know what, that&rsquo;s all that DOES matter!  <br>
This article makes little sense, with its voodoo math regarding demographics in 2008 compared to now.  Obama, of course, could win.  But there&rsquo;s little reason to logically believe he will.  Every college student doesn&rsquo;t support him, and fewer of them will likely bother to vote  &mdash;  so it doesn&rsquo;t matter one whit whether their numbers have grown by 1%!  The only thing he&rsquo;s done that blacks like is to get elected.  Most who go to the polls will still vote for him, but many will probably stay home.  He speaks the lingo many Hispanics like, but the tide of the nation is turning against them.  And what&rsquo;s he actually doing to reverse it?  Will great numbers of them bother with a ballot either?  If Obama was white and the majority of the media not leftist, we would hear of of little but his impending doom. <br>
#1 Anonymous: <br>
That 51% of the nation &#8220;on relief&#8221; includes people on Social Security, and we all don&rsquo;t vote like ghetto blacks.  And so what if felons are given the vote?  This must be done state by state, for one thing, and how fast can the legislatures work before the next presidential election?  Add to that the fact that many ex-cons go right back to crime and don&rsquo;t like to be anywhere the police might be  &mdash;  like the polls.  <br>
As for Obama being elected senator  &mdash;  check the history of that.  It was a witch&rsquo;s brew of dirty politics and dropping-out candidates.  He ultimately ran against a black Republican.  Demographics had little to do with it.</p>

		<p>One major factor which is pointedly ignored by Republicans and goes unmentioned by Democrats is the massive voter fraud in practically all big-city precincts with large black populations.  It&rsquo;s become so epidemic that Republicans are always fighting an uphill battle to get legitimate representation.  </p>
<p>The MSM has no interest in investigating and reporting on this most criminal of all social transgressions, which is a revolution in progress without a shot being fired. Interestingly, the MSM also has no interest in reporting the incidence of clear voter intimidation by threatening blacks standing around inner city polling places and staring at whites threateningly as they enter the designated voting building.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t call yourself a liberal where I can hear you. You&rsquo;re as much a liberal as a bonsai tree is a sequioa tree.</p>
<p>Your conclusions are mistaken. If minority groups X and Y usually support a candidate of A party, and group X supports a candidate unequivocally as long as he is of group X, then candidates from group X and of A party have an increasing advantage as long as groups X and Y are growing. Sure, it&rsquo;s racist. It&rsquo;s just that that racism has nothing to do with whites.</p>
<p>As it happens, if I could have voted for US president, I&rsquo;d have voted for Obama. Plenty of things I didn&rsquo;t like, plenty of things I suspected, but still, less bad than McCain. I still think so, though I hope he gets better opponent this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little wonder why liberalism, universal love and the one world vision will win and conservatives will be obliterated and discarded into the dustbin of history!&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to resurrecting old Communist slogans (and they sure had some good ones), I prefer &#8220;the ash heap of history&#8221;.</p>

		<p>With the GOP having been labeled &#8216;The Stupid Party&rsquo; by the late Sam Francis, it would seem as though the morons who run the GOP actually take some sort of perverse pride in that label and do everything possible to make sure they never lose that title.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s recap.   Finally, after 8 long and bloody years of wars that Jorge Wmd Boosch and his neo-con pals lied our nation into, based on false accusations / insinuations that were caught and thankfully preserved on hundreds of Youtube videos, and equally false and outright fabricated &#8216;evidence&rsquo; which never existed, accompanied by manufactured &#8216;threats&rsquo; which also never existed - the slow-to-awaken American public finally snapped out of their state of zombie-hood and realized what a piece of lying, criminal garbage the GOP had become - and threw them out of office, voting in a mulatto who&rsquo;s only appealing trait was his deceitful promise to end all these senseless wars that the vast majority of intelligent Americans are sick of - and which are bankrupting our nation and bringing financial ruin down upon the ship of state.    Remember, people.  Juan McAmnestyMcCain was singing bomb, bomb, bomb Iran as if he were some pimple-faced adolescent 14 year old kid with an IQ stuck in single digits - and the traditional conservative GOP base refused to vote for this lunatic and war mongering psychopath.    Remember also that in 2008, just as now - the one legitimate anti-war, America first, non-interventionist candidate - Ron Paul - received the overwhelming vast majority of financial donations from the U.S. Military - who are obviously sick and tired of having their lives put at risk in these endless and illegal neo-con wars.</p>
<p>A recent, widely circulated poll on the Web indicated that a whopping 85% of Americans are sick of these wars and want NO MORE NEW WARS to be started.   </p>
<p>So, what might the lessons be here that the blithering morons who run the GOP seem to be intellectually incapable of absorbing into their concrete encased, pea-sized brains?   Well, how about this:  the intelligent Americans who are paying attention to what is going on in their nation and in the world around them have finally concluded that these wars are not only immoral and unjustified, but they are going to cause the total financial collapse of our nation, and if these criminal, blood-thirsty neo-cons are not reined in - they are going to wind up causing WW3 and we stand a good chance of getting nuked.  </p>
<p>So, what does the GOP (aside from Ron Paul) do to react to this changing public sentiment?   Why, they send their IQ defective challengers to Obama up to the stage on debate night and they take turns foaming out the mouth like a pack of rabid dogs, screaming for more wars and for more increased defense spending - which clearly spells World War 3 and nuclear bombs falling on American cities and millions of people getting vaporized into a substance that might look a lot like tomato soup.   </p>
<p>Is this not a clear sign that the entire GOP, aside from Ron Paul, have gone completely insane?    And, they expect us to vote for one of these war mongering psychopaths in 2012?</p>

		<p>According to a poll by CNN/ORC on November 18-20, 2011, by 67 to 37 percent Americans favor &#8220;Increases in taxes on businesses and higher-income Americans.&#8221; Support for the increases has increased since August 5-7, 2011. <br>

Nevertheless, Congressional Republicans prevent such increases. <br>

I predict that support will continue to increase, and that this issue will doom the Republicans in November 2012.<br>

Because of the economy it is difficult to feel much enthusiasm for Barack Obama. Nevertheless, unemployment is gradually inching down.<br>

Most Americans were better off when Bill Clinton was president. There is little reason to believe that Republican economic policies will benefit any but the rather small minority that is better off now. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to know that your vote for Obama won&rsquo;t swing the election;  He is going to win Delaware anyway.</p>
<p>In certain parts of the country, this IS Great Depression II.</p>
<p><i>I predict that support will continue to increase, and that this issue will doom the Republicans in November 2012.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the biggest concern of even most people that support it.  Obama will win or lose re-election based on working middle class white voters in rust belt states for the most part.  It will be their assessment of the economy next November which will make the difference.</p>
<p>Ironically, in another comment in another story here at AR, you&rsquo;re peddling Romney, someone born with silver spoon firmly in mouth, as the only Republican that could beat Obama.  He might be the only Republican who would be all but guaranteed to lose, though I think he&rsquo;s still going to win both the nomination and the election.</p>

If unemployment continues to decline the President could be positioned for a decisive victory a year from now that will include control of both houses of Congress. President Obama is unlikely to get most of the white vote, but he currently leads slightly with the better educated. </p>

		<p>It will take a lot more than liberal wishful thinking to get Obama reelected. The problem he will have that will NOT be spoken about until it is too late if at all is that they are probably having trouble finding candidates. You can&rsquo;t beat somebody with nobody. I&rsquo;m in NYC. My Republican Congressman won by about 4% yet here we are almost December and the Democrats have nobody to run. What most people don&rsquo;t consider is that when you want to run YOU haver to put up about 50 to 100k of your OWN money. Who wants to write a check for 50k that you&rsquo;ll never see again and have to run with Barack Obama? Oh they will find guys. They are usually lawyers who want the sign saying &#8220;Bill Jones for Congress&#8221; to show their grandchildren. Candidates like that DON&rsquo;T create a buzz and DON&rsquo;T help raise money. Final thought DON&rsquo;T believe the media lies about Obama having ONE BILLION DOLLARS to run with - he is WAY behind that now.</p>
<p>We will see a rerun of last year except BECAUSE last year happened and PROVED it could happen there will be even more second and third tier candidates which will go down in even bigger numbers.      </p>

		<p>Obama may well win reelection despite the awful economy.  The GOP contenders are falling all over themselves advocating policies that benefit the rich elites and making bellicose statements about Iran.  This is what the big donors want to hear.  </p>
<p>The Dems are letting them run their mouths now and will use all those statements against whoever wins the GOP nomination in the general election.  </p>

		<p>Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, what will it take to wake you from the utopian dream of a world were we are all created exactly equal, entitled to exactly the same and love each other unconditionally?  Do you not recognize that it is Blacks who stand by their brother/sister Blacks no matter their merits?  Obama could not have been elected without a substantial White vote, many like yourself, just jumping at the opportunity to prove they&rsquo;re not racists.  Most knew nothing about the man, and still don&rsquo;t.  He has his school records sealed.  He&rsquo;s supposed to be this brilliant constitutional scholar, yet the only thing he&rsquo;s ever published is two books about himself, one of which he likely didn&rsquo;t even write.  And then there&rsquo;s that racist church he spent 20 years in.  Did you ever visit that church&rsquo;s website BEFORE the Rev. Wright videos came out?  I did.  The home page was a map of Africa and in their mission statement they proudly stated they were Afro-centrists while in the same breath calling Euro-centrists &#8220;racists&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m sure you never worked in a situation were the majority of the workforce was Black, because if you did, you would know how racist the majority of Black are.  It&rsquo;s not Conservatives who are destined for the dust heap of history, it&rsquo;s Liberalism.  Liberalism is just Communism on the slow road.  Eventually, even dreamers like you will wake up and realize the truth, about race and human nature and nature itself.  I suggest you go take a trip to Africa and see what happens when Whites hand over power to Blacks, but be care.  Johannesburg is the rape capitol of the world now.</p>

		<p>Liberal Weiss&hellip;as if the &#8220;voting block&#8221; of blacks somehow does not have a racial connotation.  It is okay to look at life through a racial/ethnic filter if you are black or hispanic, but not if you are white.

		<p>&#8220;When the GOP gives us amnesty loving politicians like Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, is it any wonder why Obama will win? Not to mention the fact that most GOP canidates want to start another war in the Middle East by invading Iran. The GOP learned nothing from the foolishness of George W. Bush&#8221;</p>
<p>You could not be more correct. I see some of the comments like you would have to be insane to be a White and vote Democratic. Since both parties are anti WN it comes down to not voting, or maybe a third party. However if you forced me to vote for a Dem or Rep. I am sorry to say the nod would go to the Dems. There is a 50/50 chance they will not start a war with Iran. The REPs openly say they will start a war. I think that war will be the end of the U.S. At least the Dems may give us at least a few more years to revolt befoe there is nothing left to revolt over.</p>

<p>Tax the Rich?  Isn&rsquo;t that one of 0bama&rsquo;s class warfare mantras?</p>
<p>Recently 0bama stated:   <i>I do think at a certain point you&rsquo;ve made enough money.</i></p>
<p>0bama is fueling class warfare aimed at &#8220;The Rich.&#8221;  Who get to decide who is rich? 0bama?  The jerks at OWS who believe they are entitled &#8220;free&#8221; health care, a &#8220;world-class education&#8221; or a &#8220;guaranteed living-wage income&#8221; regardless of employment&#8221; status?   &mdash;   without having a clue that these things cost a lot of money, which the government DOES NOT HAVE except by printing it, borrowing it, or confiscating it from someone.</p>
<p>Walter Williams writes:</p>
<p><i>Class warfare thrives on ignorance about the sources of income. Listening to some of the talk about income differences, one would think that there&rsquo;s a pile of money meant to be shared equally among Americans. Rich people got to the pile first and greedily took an unfair share</i> </p>
<p>Did&#8221; Tax The Rich&#8221; policies work in 1932 and 1935?</p>
<p><i>The onset of the Great Depression in 1929 led to a sharp decline in tax revenues, as the economy contracted. President Herbert Hoover&rsquo;s response was to push for a major tax increase. The Revenue Act of 1932 raised tax rates across the board, with the top rate rising from 25 percent to 63 percent. The $462 million deficit of 1931 jumped to $2.7 billion by 1932 despite the tax increase&hellip; the higher tax rates on the wealthy actually caused the tax burden to be shifted to the nonwealthy&hellip;Economists today recognize Hoover&rsquo;s tax increase as a terrible blunder, which deepened and prolonged the depression.</i></p>
<p>Roosevelt excoriated Hoover in the 1932 campaign for his error.   What did Roosevelt do after the election?  Call for even higher taxes aimed at &#8220;The Rich&#8221; (some posit he did this to punish his enemies). I read once where Roosevelt took great pleasure in reviewing his enemies&rsquo; tax returns after his &#8220;soak the rich&#8221; policies were implemented.</p>
<p><i>Roosevelt Roosevelt pressed for still higher rates on the rich, especially aimed at the very wealthy.  The top rate was raised to 79 percent, estate taxes were raised, and a wide variety of other taxes increased as well. The U.S. economy suffered a sharp setback in 1937. That and Democratic losses in 1938 eventually led to a scale-back of overt &#8220;soak-the-rich&#8221; tax policies.</i></p>
<p>Source:  <i>The Futility of Raising Tax Rates,</i> Cato Institute, Policy Analysis No. 192.  https://goo.gl/qAwWo</p>
<p>Would it be different this time do you think?  Should 0bama repeat the errors of Hoover and Roosevelt in the name of &#8220;Economic Justice&#8221;  when all evidence shows this policy doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>
<p>Is 0bama right that at a &#8220;certain point, people have made too much money?&#8221;  At &#8220;a certain point&#8221;, it is 0bama&rsquo;s duty to confiscate what he thinks is &#8220;the right amount&#8221; from The Rich and redistribute it to those who didn&rsquo;t earn it (in the name of &#8220;Economic Justice&#8221;, of course)?  </p>
<p>Will a Tax the Rich policy work this time?  Dr. Williams certainly doesn&rsquo;t think so:</p>

You can put your spin on it if you want, but those are the facts.<br>
 <br>
You quoted this: &#8220;the U.S. economy suffered a sharp setback in 1937. That and Democratic losses in 1938 eventually led to a scale-back of overt &#8216;soak-the-rich&rsquo; tax policies.</p>

 <br>
The increase in unemployment after 1937 was caused by cuts in government spending. Unemployment declined when government spending was increased again. Far from scaling back soak the rich tax policies, the top tax rate continued to grow. In 1944 it was raised to 94 percent.  </p>

Economists cannot prove their theories with controlled, repeatable experiments the way chemists and physicists can. We cannot go back in time, choose different policies, and measure different results. <br>
     <br>
Nevertheless, life for most Americans began to improve almost as soon as Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated president. Life for them continued to improve while he was president. This is why he was reelected three times. It is why the Democrats retained large majorities in Congress. It is why it has never been possible for Republicans to repeal the basic reforms of the New Deal. </p>

<p><i>Nevertheless, life for most Americans began to improve almost as soon as Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated president. Life for them continued to improve while he was president.</i> </p>
<p>I glad my grandparents can&rsquo;t hear you say this.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone who lived through the Great Depression pines for those times again!</p>
<p>Roosevelt LIED to the American People (remember, this was in the days before TV and the Internet   &mdash;   he had the bully pulpit all to himself).  He vilified &#8220;big&#8221; businesses and banks, calling them &#8220;brownshirts.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>In running for president, Franklin Roosevelt denounced the Hoover administration&rsquo;s misguided policies  &mdash;  saying the government had become too big and too intrusive. He pledged to cut both taxes and the size of government by 25%.</i></p>
<p>But once elected, FDR expanded Hoover&rsquo;s policies tripling the size of government within eight years.</p>
<p><i>With the aid of a compliant Congress, his administration transformed government into the arbiter of nearly all major economic decisions  &mdash;  investigating and regulating every corner of American life and business. It forced farmers to destroy crops, tried to set minimum prices on everything, and set loose new commissions, agencies, and boards on every industry in the land.</i></p>
<p><i>The maximum income tax rate rose to 94%. The New Deal also imposed new taxes on cars, tires, phone calls, bank transactions, and a host of other goods and services  &mdash;  taxes you still pay today.</i></p>
<p><i>Although historians at government-supported institutions love to say that Franklin Roosevelt saved the country from economic ruin, few mention that in 1939 unemployment was worse than in 1931 and business still hadn&rsquo;t recovered from 10-year-old shocks. And since Americans then had to struggle with the shortages and inflation of World War II, it was the late 1940s (almost two decades after the 1929 crash) before living standards returned to normal.</i></p>
<p><i>Roosevelt&rsquo;s 1937 efforts to &#8220;pack&#8221; the Supreme Court and to purge conservatives in the 1938 Democratic primaries made him look like the real threat to democracy. In March of that year he felt compelled to tell the press that he had &#8220;no inclination to be a dictator.&#8221; Nevertheless, the Republicans recovered from near-extinction in the midterm and the New Deal came to a halt.</i></p>
<p>FDR&rsquo;s secretary of Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, who served from 1934 to 1945, wrote in 1939:</p>
<p><i>We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. &hellip; I say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started &hellip; and an enormous debt to boot!</i></p>
<p>Was he wrong when he wrote this?</p>
<p>Roosevelt also LIED to the American people about sending &#8220;American Boys&#8221; to fight and die in Europe in WW II (when in reality, he was busy maneuvering the US into &#8220;joining the war effort&#8221;).</p>

What is not in dispute is that unemployment declined during the Roosevelt administration, and there was more economic growth per year under FDR than under the administrations of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. <br>
 <br>
President Harding was inaugurated in 1921. President Coolidge&rsquo;s last full year in office was 1928, one year before the Stock Market crash. Republicans who reject the reforms of the New Deal consider this to be a time of robust economic growth.<br>
 <br>
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1921 in terms of 1996 dollars was $5,758. By 1928 that had grown to $7,439, representing a net increase of $1,681. When Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933 the per capita GDP was $4,804. Four years later that had grown to $6,423 for a net increase of $1,619. <br>
 <br>
<a href="https://www.singularity.com/charts/page99.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.singularity.com/charts/page99.html</a><br>
 <br>
There was nearly as much economic growth during Franklin Roosevelt&rsquo;s first term as during eight years when the Republican Party dominated the country. Also, the economic growth of the Roaring Twenties was unevenly distributed. Very little of it trickled down to most Americans. That high rate of economic inequality made the United States vulnerable to the Stock Market Crash of 1929, which again happened when the Republican Party dominated the country. </p>

The U.S. Constitution was not written to limit the power of the government, but to increase the power of the government, because the Articles of Confederation had proven to be inadequate.<br>
 <br>
If the U.S. Constitution had precise and obvious meanings, Supreme Court decisions would nearly always be unanimous. They very seldom are because the Constitution has vague meanings that people read their concerns into. <br>
 <br>
Reading the Constitution can resemble reading a horoscope rather than the multiplication tables. The only thing we can be sure of is that the Constitution provides a guide on how to operate a representative democracy.   </p>

<p>We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. &hellip; I say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started &hellip; and an enormous debt to boot!</p>
<p>Was he wrong when he wrote this?<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
Yes he was. When Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1932 the unemployment rate was 23.9 percent. In 1938 it was 19.0 percent. In 1940 it was 14.6. percent.<br>

		<p>This is my final post here, John.  I do not have the luxury of unlimited time as I must work full time to support not only myself and my family, but millions of others the government demands I support as well.</p>
<p>John, you simply must give up placing all of your faith in Krugman, New Deal mythology and the NYTimes and expand your economic horizons.</p>
<p>Here is a start, from The Future of Freedom Foundation, a selection of writers debunking the myths of The Great Depressions and why implementing those same big government policies now will lead to a second disaster:</p>
<p>https://www.fff.org/issues/newdeal.asp</p>
<p>Statism triumphed over freedom during the New Deal decade.  You will not convince me that tripling the power of the government, as Franklin Roosevelt did, made the American people more free or prosperous, in fact his policies did exactly the opposite.  The New Deal disaster allowed government to expand its control over our lives. Since the 1930s, there is no area of American life that is considered off limits to the politicians.</p>
<p><i>Admirers of FDR credit his New Deal with restoring the American economy after the disastrous contraction of 1929 &mdash; 33. Without a shadow of a doubt–the New Deal hampered recovery from the contraction, prolonged and added to unemployment, and set the stage for ever more intrusive and costly government.</i> </p>
<p>–Milton Friedman, Nobel Laureate, Hoover Institution</p>
<p>Following Roosevelt&rsquo;s example, President 0bama has promised to empower labor unions, force up wages, nationalize health care, and further nationalize the country&rsquo;s financial system. His supporters want higher tariffs, more import quotas, a freeze on mortgage foreclosures, and direct economic relief, along with substantially higher taxes on wealthy people.</p>
<p>Government, despite what Roosevelt and 0bsma&rsquo;s teleprompter tell us, cannot create something out of nothing, the &#8220;soaring&#8221; rhetoric of politicians notwithstanding</p>
<p>And this on Paul Krugman:</p>
<p><i>Paul Krugman now is trying to claim that if the U.S. Government increases taxes on some people, that will help lead us out of the depression. It would be the first time in human history that increasing taxes brought economic recovery.</i></p>
<p>Krugman demands higher taxes on &#8220;the rich&#8221; (of which category multi-millionaire Krugman resides), and calls for a financial transactions tax, writing:</p>
<p><i>And it&rsquo;s instructive, too, to note that some countries already have financial transactions taxes  &mdash;  and that among those who do are Hong Kong and Singapore. If some conservative starts claiming that such taxes are an unwarranted government intrusion, you might want to ask him why such taxes are imposed by the two countries that score highest on the Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s Index of Economic Freedom.</i></p>
<p><i>Krugman fails to add that neither Hong Kong nor Singapore have the punitive taxes on income, corporate profits, and capital gains that we have in this country   &mdash;   and Krugman demands that they be made even more draconian.</i></p>
<p><i>What does this mean? It means that there will be no economic recovery in the years to come. Paul Krugman really wants us to believe that if the U.S. Government both jacks up tax rates and spending, that the end result will be prosperity. That simply is not going to happen.</i></p>
<p><i>Just because Krugman has made millions of dollars calling for expansion of state power does not mean expansion of state power is a good thing. As we are going to find out in the coming years, the countries where Keynesian economics is practiced are going to be those countries with declining economies and declining standards of living.</i></p>
<p>From Krugman in Wonderland,  <i>Drowning in Keynesian Fallacies</i>, Nov. 20th, 2011.</p>

		<p>Bon, From the Land of Babble,<br>
 <br>
As soon as you can find some time away from your job I would appreciate it if you would respond to my arguments using your own words, as I do. Anyone can find something on the internet they agree with. At the very least, read your own posts, and give some indication that you understand them. <br>
 <br>
Although I have an enormous admiration for Paul Krugman, I do not quote him as though what he says is the absolute truth, the way you quoted Milton Friedman. <br>
       <br>
I proved myself that there was more job creation per year under Roosevelt, even before preparation for the Second World War, than during the &#8220;Roaring Twenties,&#8221; when the Republican Party and the values and concerns of the business community dominated the country. I documented my argument with data I discovered on the internet that was compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce. <br>
 <br>
I do my own thinking, Bon. I expect credit for it, and ask you to do the same. I would like for you to compose your own arguments. I have encountered Henry Morgenthau&rsquo;s quote on numerous occasions. It is easy to refute because it is factually incorrect. This does not keep reactionaries from quoting it again and again as though repetition turns a falsehood into a truth. </p>

<p>I use the quotes to support my arguments; the composition and organization is mine as are the words not in italics.</p>
<p>Here is the crux of my argument, these are my own words as they are written above:</p>
<p>Statism triumphed over freedom during the New Deal decade. You will not convince me that tripling the power of the government, as Franklin Roosevelt did, made the American people more free or prosperous; in fact his policies did exactly the opposite. The New Deal disaster allowed government to expand its control over our lives. Since the 1930s, there is no area of American life that is considered off limits to the politicians.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have to agree to disagree on this issue.  If you want to believe The New Deal worked, fine.  I never will.  </p>

<p>Statism triumphed over freedom during the New Deal decade. <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
How do you define &#8220;freedom?&#8221; <br>
     <br>
I agree that the New Deal reduced the freedom - or I would say the power - of employers. The basic fact that unemployment declined during most of the New Deal meant that employers needed to compete more vigorously for employees. Employees in turn had greater freedom to look for better jobs. <br>
       <br>
Unemployment compensation made the threat of being fired somewhat less coercive. The spread of unions also made it more difficult for employers to fire employees, and required them to pay employees more than they would have otherwise been required to do so.<br>
 <br>
For each of these reasons the New Deal increased the freedom of employees, which is to say the majority of Americans.  <br>
 <br>
Average wages increased during the New Deal, and continued to do so until the recession of 1974.  <br>
 <br>
The freedom that is most important to me is intellectual freedom. By that I mean one&rsquo;s freedom to investigate different points of view - like those presented on American Renaissance - and to express one&rsquo;s opinions without fear of legal, economic, and social sanctions. Since perhaps 1970 the left has been the greater offender against intellectual freedom by enforcing the constraints of political correctness. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, from the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917 to the Tet Offensive in 1968, when the War in Vietnam became unpopular, it was dangerous in the United States to criticize capitalism, advocate socialism, and defend Communist countries. </p>
