<h1>University Deems &#8220;Graham Cracker&#8221; Offensive</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, November 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Graham McMillan decided to run for a student government office at Texas Christian University, he had no idea that he would land in trouble  &mdash;  all because of his campaign slogan  &mdash;  &#8220;Graham Cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>A university official at the home of the Horned Frogs told the 20-year-old sophomore that his campaign signs were offensive and unless the offending word was blocked  &mdash;  the signs would have to come down.</p>
<p>&#8220;My advisor contacted me and informed me that it might be considered derogatory,&#8221; the political science major told Fox News. &#8220;I certainly didn&rsquo;t mean it to be derogatory, but I didn&rsquo;t want to offend anybody who may perceive it as such.&#8221;</p>
<p>University officials released a statement to Fox confirming that the offensive word is &#8216;cracker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;She recommended that he either remove the signs or cover the word &#8216;cracker&rsquo; with tape and he opted to cover the word,&#8221; a university spokesperson told Fox.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So who might be offended by the &#8220;Graham Cracker&#8221; campaign signs?</p>
<p>The university didn&rsquo;t say and McMillan had no idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve never been around that word being used offensively,&#8221; said McMillan, who happens to be white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>I think the university dean was upset because a white person was calling himself &#8220;cracker&#8221;, i.e. the dean considered it a taunt against non-whites.  This was not about protecting whites from being called &#8220;cracker&#8221; - a name which bounces right off us with no harm done.</p>

		<p>I think &#8220;cracker&#8221; was a term used by blacks toward whites  whom they deemed rednecks. I haven&rsquo;t heard any complaints from that sector yet, however, so give it a rest TCU, and let the guy use the slogan. I think he&rsquo;s very inovative and hope he wins.</p>

There are many offensive terms for whites. Cracker, redneck, pecker-wood, honky, et.al.</p>
<p>The difference between blacks and whites is that whites, while they may be offended, do not necessarily let these words affect their lives. </p>
<p>Blacks, on the otherhand, are thrown into a tailspin when confronted with offensive words.</p>
<p>Whites seem to take to heart that &#8216;sticks and stones may break my bones by names will never hurt me&rsquo; while blacks believe (or at least use offensive words to their political advantage) that words cause real damage.<br>

		<p>Since he seems to be using &#8220;cracker&#8221; in a positive sense, the same way blacks tend to use the &#8216;other&rsquo; word to describe themselves, they may have been concerned that there would be racial connotations where blacks are concerned, not whites. Cracker can be used almost as defiant white racial terminology. To some blacks it&rsquo;s associated with slavery.</p>

<p>Not sure how many really find the word cracker to be offensive. The term redneck is now embraced by many whites in Southern states, in Middle Georgia the term is used affectionately and they even have the Redneck Games to celebrate it every summer.</p>

		<p>Whites are thicker-skinned than blacks.</p>
<p>Recently it was reported that whites had Neanderthal DNA. While whites are indifferent to news like this, blacks are hyper-sensitive about being perceived as having &#8216;primitiveness&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whites have little trouble over-coming claims that Asians as a group do better than whites in some learning tasks, but blacks reject the fact that they aren&rsquo;t equal to other races.</p>
<p>Whites laugh off derogatory names, blacks go into a frenzy.</p>

		<p>What Mr. Graham should do is to cover up the &#8220;cracker&#8221; part with a piece of tape reading:  CENSORED BY TCU</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d bet the farm that exposing the PC frauds would never occur to this fellow.  Whites really need to get their thinking right, and that begins with fighting back for what is ours.</p>

		<p>I think the derogatory term cracker for White comes from crackerjack.</p>
<p>Before it became a popcorn brand, it meant very skilled. He&rsquo;s a crackerjack carpenter, mechanic. I&rsquo;m 70. I heard it all the time. One of my aunts was an office manager and legal secretary for a big law firm.  I remember her being called a crackerjack secretary. My parents used the term when they told people about  a skilled mechanic.  </p>
<p>The word is probably on one of the censorship lists universities have.  And they teach the catholic church was narrow minded because they had a list of about 100 books catholics were not supposed to read.</p>

		<p>I think the point there are a few points being missed here:</p>
<p>#1 - Contrast this to the &#8220;N word.&#8221;  Allowing whites to openly, proudly, and publicly use what&rsquo;s considered to be an ethnic slur but get angry when non-whites do would begin to stimulate a sense of &#8220;White Identity&#8221; and perhaps even &#8220;White Unity.&#8221;  Those are the two most dangerous concepts to the marxist liberals who understand Whites MUST remain divided to ensure their dispossession. </p>
<p>#2 - Some groups of young, white males choose to react to the use of &#8220;N word&#8221; by Blacks by using the term &#8220;cracker&#8221; with each other in exactly the same way.  On more than on occasion I have witnessed Blacks being &#8220;angered&#8221; by this because they felt the Whites were &#8220;making fun of them.&#8221;  </p>
<p>#3 - Example number 1 million of the double standards in our society.  I see and hear the &#8220;N word&#8221; used incessantly by Blacks with ZERO repercussions, but - oh Boy! - we can&rsquo;t have a White kid do anything of the like because that would mean THAT BOTH GROUPS HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS!</p>

		<p>Just between us White people and the wall: White people simply cannot be insulted by Blacks, or any other race.  Cheated, robbed, killed, yes; but insulted no.<br>
<p> <br>
Why not?  Because anything bad that is true about White people can be turned around to show it&rsquo;s good.  Take the horribly sad fact that Whites owned slaves and abused them.  Wouldn&rsquo;t Blacks love to say that they owned White slaves and abuse them?  Owning and abusing slaves is a sign of superiority.<br>
<p><br>
White bashers have the same problem with the newly created crime of colonizing countries.  The complaints that Whites ruined Africa, India, the Far and Middle East by conquering then ruling them simply is a round about way of saying that Whites are superior.  <br>
<p><br>
Superiority is what it is about the White race that they hate.  Igniting their hate is the vice of envy.  Being called a White Supremacist actually flatters the groups that get so branded.  You may have notice that groups advertising themselves as White Supremacist groups are filled with obviously un-superior grade of White people.  (Ever wonder if there is a conspiracy afoot by the anti-White forces to create and fund these groups?)<br>
<p><br>
The bottom line is that as long as White people feel that they belong to a superior race, or the best race, they will not be troubled by insults from the less fortunate that do not belong.  They should take note that the White race is under heavy attack and defend themselves though.  <br>
<p><br>
The day when a Black calls a White person a cracker, honky, redneck and White people actually feel hurt, that is the day when we are in big trouble.  <br>

		<p>We&rsquo;re missing the real victim here: frogs.</p>
<p>As a frog, I am offended by TSU&rsquo;s insensitive use of a &#8220;horned&#8221; toad as their mascot.</p>
<p>Yes, we frogs are prostrated with unfortunate skin conditions, but pointing this out through their mascot is very hurtful!</p>
<p>Or maybe TCU is suggesting that frogs are &#8220;evil&#8221; and thus require horns. Like devil horns. Such cruel stereotyping! I would expect more from a Christian school.</p>
<p>That is enough for now. It&rsquo;s tough typing with webbed fingers*, even if it is on a LilyiPad.</p>
<p>*not that this makes me any less equal than you; I am proud of my American-Amphibious heritage.</p>

		<p>These attempts (that seem to be increasing) to find some slur terms for whites that are &#8220;harmful&#8221; etc. to us is comical.  Sorry PC&rsquo;ers, but these terms are just laughable.  The behind-our-backs terms Ofay and Honky, and their modern synonyms, have no resonance or insult power to me or any white I&rsquo;ve ever known.  Just the way it is.</p>
<p>Most or all of the other terms like redneck, cracker, hick, white trash, etc. were coined, and mainly used, by whites.</p>
<p>The leftists are trying to get the whites into their camp by pointing out that we, too, are horribly oppressed by some slang terms.  Try to ignore them.</p>

		<p>Sonya, there are also derogatory names for specific white ethnic groups. What about mick, paddy, limey, frog, dago, kraut, gerry, greaseball, rooskie, pollock, wop, etc? Some members of these ethnic group members don&rsquo;t mind being called these disparaging designations. However, it depends on the person,context &amp; enviroment. I attended Catholic schools were one could get away with calling someone an ethnic slur with impunity, much to the dismay of the clerics who ran these great institutions! On the other side of the coin, you wouldn&rsquo;t wanted to use such names at an ethnic festival or wedding. </p>

A black person calling a white person a cracker shows envy. A white person calling himself a cracker shows stupidity. It is like a black person calling himself a N***a.  </p>
<p>Originally the word Cracker meant someone who made moonshine. It had something to do with cracking the corn or making corn mash. In the movie Deliverance, Burt Reynolds character calls those two toothless moonshiners &#8220;crackers.&#8221; Basically a cracker is someone that is toothless and stupid and homosexual.</p>

		<p>Not sure if political correctness is applying to whites in this case, it&rsquo;s a white person censured and deemed &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. Let there be actually real violence on white by persons of color, however, and not a word will be said. Except that we need to be even more sensitive to these same persons of color.  </p>

		<p>#23: It seems that there is more than one interpretaion of the word, &#8220;Cracker&#8221;. </p>
<p>When I first heard it said by blacks, I had to ask myself what form of insult can it be to be called a type of cookie? It just didn&rsquo;t make any sense, but then, nothing they do makes any sense to me, so I really didn&rsquo;t stress over it.</p>
<p>Later, I found out that it was a reference to someone cracking a whip, or the Whip Cracker. </p>
<p>But in their feeble minds, all Whites owned Slaves at one time. </p>

		<p>No. 25 is right! I believe.  I read a black history book one time and the way I remember it is poor white people could not afford to buy a horse for their wagons  so they had to buy a mule which is cheaper. Now mules are harder to get moving as they are said to be stubborn therefore the need to crack the whip which made a loud crack and black people used cracker as a term for poor whites who were probably worse off than them. You could hear the poor or &#8220;po&#8221; whites coming by the loud crack of the whip. The term white trash comes from white people who were indentured servants and after being worked to death were thrown on the trash heap. All the people who take out student loans nowadays  are what proverbs says which is&#8221; the borrower is slave or servant  to the lender&rsquo;. Go to Youtube and look up the college conspiracy.  It doesn&rsquo;t look like people will ever learn to treat each other decent.</p>
