			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>C.J. Sullivan, New York Post, November 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A valiant straphanger who confronted three thugs for spitting on the train was beaten as laughing passengers filmed the sickening attack.</p>
<p>Daniel Endara, 25, was coming home from his birthday celebration on Nov. 8 when the trio barged onto the L-train and harassed fellow riders near the Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues Station in Brooklyn, authorities said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were making noise and acting like they were mad about something,&#8221; Endara told The Post. &#8220;One of them spat on the floor and hit a woman in her late 40s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the thugs got angry at his intervening and took off his shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ready to fight,&#8221; said Endara, a student and security guard. &#8220;If I fought him one-on-one, I would have knocked him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trio punched and stomped Endara, who is seen in the video bravely fighting back as he struggled to crawl to his feet, wiping blood off his face as passengers taunted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was very angry at these guys, but I understand they come from a tough environment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Jail won&rsquo;t help them. They need to learn how to give back to the community instead of always taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the women who were cruelly laughing and filming the assault simply need &#8220;to learn how to act.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is this type of attitude that allows these thugs to roam our streets and ride the subways.</p>

		<p>I accidentally got on that subway line once coming home from a meeting in Manhattan.  It was about 9:30 am at night when I was able to exit the train and go out on the street and enter on the opposite side to go back to Times Square.  When I got out on the street, - I thought I was in deepest, darkest Africa.  There were thousands of black people all over the place, as far as the eye could see, milling about aimlessly, shucking and jiving.  I am not exaggerating here when I say everyone stopped and looked at me and did a double take.  I was the only white face there.  When I noticed a bunch of gang bangers eyeing me with hunter eyes, I high-tailed it to the return train!</p>
<p>Those clueless white liberals, like this one in the video, think they&rsquo;re all &#8216;bohemian&rsquo; or being culturally &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; when they go around these all-black, thuggy areas.  I have no sympathy for this guy here.  I see them everyday espousing &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and other Marxist stuff.  The occupy wall street anarchists and clueless Marxists are also the same.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ve yet to see the viral video that will begin the rollback of Diversity is our Strength.  When it does hit, don&rsquo;t expect it to say up for long.  It will be so horrific, that the Diversity Enforcers will take it down asap.   </p>
<p>&#8220;We just can&rsquo;t afford to let free speech risk all the progress we&rsquo;ve made.  Some speech is hate speech, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed. Anything that stokes racial tensions through lies that spread hatred and bigotry will not be tolerated.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Too bad the two diversity thugs didn&rsquo;t video Eve Carson as she begged for her life by telling them how committed she was to Diversity.  Her support of the UNITAS Diversity Housing Initiative helped her get elected to UNC Student Body President.<br>

		<p>Anon #2- You did no such thing. The L train does not run anywhere near Times Square.</p>
<p>You said you got out at 9:30am at night ?</p>
<p>If you had gotten out at Times Square you would have seen tens of thousands of tourists, all white. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in NYC since 1988, and at no point was Times Square like deepest, darkest Africa. Prior to the mid 90&rsquo;s it could definitely be dicey if you were an unwary tourist, but the majority of people, both then and now, are white. And almost all of them go about their business with no problem whatsoever.<br>
As far as the original topic, the young fellow getting beaten should stop making excuses for violent thugs. And supposedly coming from a tough environment gives no one an excuse to jump an innocent guy minding his own business.<br>
Long live Bernie Goetz !!!</p>

		<p>People familiar with my comments know that I will occasionally say something like, &#8220;I went to a majority black school in a majority black city&#8221;. But I never really explain or give further details. That video is the explanation. And I have 13 years of details.</p>

		<p>• Once again, this underscores the validity of so-called &#8216;Jim Crow&rsquo; laws that segregated blacks and Whites on public transportation. </p>
<p>• The fact that the laughing black passengers didn&rsquo;t bother to dial 911 makes them complicit, IMHO.</p>
<p>• Had the attackers been White and the victim black, this would have been national &#8216;James Byrd&rsquo; news for months. </p>
<p>• I&rsquo;ve personally witnessed such attacks dozens of times when I attended a predominantly black high school. I was frequently assaulted; always without provocation, always from behind and always out numbered by my black attackers. </p>
<p>• The victim&rsquo;s apologetic tone for his attackers proves how deeply rooted multiculturalism is in the American psyche. We&rsquo;ve been thoroughly brainwashed by the media. </p>
<p>• My guess: These black attackers were jacked up on drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>• The next time you hear someone say, &#8220;Diversity is America&rsquo;s greatest strength,&#8221; remember this video. Ask yourself, &#8220;How are hundreds of black-on-White crimes a strength?&#8221;</p>

		<p>     This is a classic example why not another taxpayer dollar should be spent on public transportation.  Subway trains would be very useful in a civilized society but you can not use them safely in this country.  Who would want to ride on an eleven car train with only two transit employees on it.  Even the two would probably not be sympathetic to white people.  It has been said that the only purpose of this &#8216;L&rsquo; train is to bring muggers from Brooklyn into Manhattan where there are more prosperous victims.</p>

		<p>The thing is if you&rsquo;re going to confront most blacks, especially black men, about anything you have to be prepared for a real fight if you&rsquo;re outnumbered. You can&rsquo;t use half-measures when alone, like he did, and expect them to back down.  Go all out with them or don&rsquo;t bother. They already had their juices flowing and were in pack mode. Too many whites still can&rsquo;t seem to wrap their minds around that. You won&rsquo;t be able to talk them down or only have a shoving match when they have the advantage.</p>
<p>I thought by his appearance and his last name that Daniel Endara might be Hispanic(I guess). You would think that he would know better by experience since they have to live pretty close to blacks sometimes. I bet this wouldn&rsquo;t happen to a Hispanic in L.A. without retaliation.</p>

<p>When are whites going to understand that blacks do not abide by our rules of fair play or anything else for that matter. The only thing the majority of these people know is force. If you&rsquo;re going to take on a black, be ready to use ANYTHING as a weapon and be ready to fight dirty, and if you&rsquo;re not going to fight, be ready to exit quickly. </p>

<p><br>
This might be just a typo. If #2 meant to type UNION Square, not Times Square, then his IRT geography would make sense. The L Train runs along 14th St out to (my old stomping grounds) Williamsburg and other, less-savory &#8216;hoods further out into Crooklyn. The subway stop #2 got out at to head back into Manhattan may well have been heavily black. </p>
<p>I remember the L was a dangerous train back in the early &rsquo;90s when I lived there   &mdash;   and apparently its safety has not improved since. I&rsquo;m just glad I don&rsquo;t have to ride it any more. </p>

<i>&#8220;A valiant straphanger who confronted three thugs for spitting on the train&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As someone who rides mass transit to and from work, seeing rude, obnoxious behavior is a common occurrence. It can range from two people shouting their conversation across the train to people who insist on opening a window on the bus in August when the air conditioner is on full. </p>
<p>As much as I would like to confront people, I don&rsquo;t. However, stuff like this happens (not everyday) but a couple times a week.</p>
<p>I play it out in my head. If I confront them, then what? A verbal or physical fight erupts. The police show up. The police take the side of the creep and they tell me I should have just left the guy alone. I did once confront a man who opened the window on an AC cooled bus and we got into a shouting match. The bus driver didn&rsquo;t come to my defense and neither did any passengers. When I got off the bus, the driver gave me a very angry look. He didn&rsquo;t want any trouble and I gave him some. He and everyone else would rather let these jerks do what they want than confront them.</p>
<p>How many battles can you fight each day before you get into a fight with a guy with a knife or someone who&rsquo;s willing to beat you to death because you &#8216;dissed&rsquo; them?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s life in the urban jungle. </p>

		<p>Self imposed Jim Crow is the only practical solution. I know that depending on where you live its not always practicle but whenever possible stay away from them&hellip; Don&rsquo;t go where they go, don&rsquo;t shop where they shop, don&rsquo;t eat where they eat, don&rsquo;t do what they do. If you see them congregating, AVOID. They are prone to spontaneous and irrational fits of violence at any given time. Just check YouTube et al. for the latest video savagery. Whether its in McDonalds, the mall, the subway or a convenience store, unprovoked violence is only a heartbeat away, so beware! Teach your families this. If you do need to go amongst them make sure you are legally armed and prepared to defend yourself. This is today&rsquo;s reality and its not likely to get any better so get used to it. Its a matter of self preservation. </p>

		<p>You cement heads underestimate this fighting hero. His nonsense new age clap trap was a smoke screen. If he had said the truth the cops would make certain he never got a gun permit. This boy is out for revenge. Goetz was stupid, he didn`t hire me. If he was my client all he would have said was, &#8221; What subway car?. Goetz gave some stupid statement about how he just wanted to destroy the punks. He ended up doing a year for possesing a pistol that the jury ruled he was justified for using.

		<p>When I first spent significant time in NYC, in the late 70&rsquo;s, I was in my late teens &amp; wild-eyed.  A jazz fan mesmerized by the music.  When I moved there in the mid 80&rsquo;s I was more seasoned yet a conformist, AKA &#8220;liberal&#8221;, although in truth I was apolitical.  By the time I moved away, in the mid-2000&rsquo;s, I was a right-wing white &#8220;race-realist&#8221; eager to escape.</p>
<p>Incidents such as the one featured here are daily occurrences times &#8220;x&#8221;.  Most don&rsquo;t make the news, or even the police stats.</p>
<p>Maybe there are evil white youths who screw with people randomly, but I never saw that.  All were black or &#8220;hispanic&#8221; in my many years there.</p>
<p>Spending time at various precincts including One Police Plaza after my last &#8220;mugging&#8221; looking at hundreds of mugshots was the real eye-opener.  A sea of &#8220;minorities&#8221;.  Around 1999.</p>
<p>P.S.  This mugging was in my own apt. building, while getting my mail, at 8:30 am.  The black ruffian was hiding in a corner somewhere, and blindsided me.  Acted like he had a weapon, but I could tell he didn&rsquo;t.  The reason the cops wanted me to co-operate was because I fought back, chased the guy off, &amp; flagged down cops in the subway downstairs.  They thought I&rsquo;d make a good witness; but they never did catch him, as far as I know.</p>
<p>I used to &#8220;I love NY&#8221;; now, good riddance.</p>

		<p>If this had been whites beating a black, this would be headline news for weeks.  Instead, per usual, this will never make the national news, and probably barely make local news, as it is just that pathetically commonplace.</p>
<p>The only thing that curbed blacks predisposition toward barbaric behavior was the threat of overwhelming physical retribution.  Nowadays, they know they can behave the way they do with utter impunity.  Since whites don&rsquo;t seem like they&rsquo;ll rediscover intestinal fortitude anytime soon, I must say, the one good thing about the Hispanic invasion is that they do not allow black barbarity to stand in their communities.  Would that Whites would do the same.  Of course, we&rsquo;d then be vilified from dawn to dusk by traitorous liberal whites in the media and from every other rock under which traitorous liberal whites live.</p>
<p>Blacks present reign of terror will be short lived as demographics continue to change.  I&rsquo;d rather that whites reasserted ourselves, but I&rsquo;ll take some satisfaction seeing blacks tamed again, by whomever. </p>

I was going back there from the train route I had inadvertantly taken and ended up where I didn&rsquo;t want to be.

		<p>He might not have said that the blacks came from a bad environment and needed to learn to give back to the community.</p>
<p>A good friend is a reporter.  They are under orders to insert this  type of statement when they report black on White crime.<br>
The idea is that if the White victims understand and forgive the black criminals the crime is not so evil as it really is.<br>
 In every story about black crime something must be put in to blame the crime on White society.  If the reporter can claim the White victim feels White society is to blame, so much the better. <br>

		<p>This happened two stops away from where I live. Contrary to some other poster&rsquo;s statements the L train is a very white subway line, it doesn&rsquo;t even begin to get black until the last 4 or 5 stops when you get into East New York and Canarsie which are very very dangerous areas. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mta.info/nyct/maps/submap.htm</a></p>
<p>Until you get to that point you are in Lower Manhattan, then Williamsburg and Bushwick which are mostly white with more Puerto Ricans and Mexicans the further east you go.</p>
<p>At the Broadway Junction stop you are officially entering black turf. The Nation of Islam is always there hawking their &#8220;Final Call&#8221; newspaper exhorting blacks to attack whites as well as random assorted black lunatics with cardboard signs and homemade pamphlets about why blacks are the superior race. I have no idea how they are not arrested for inciting violence  &mdash;   I have literally scene them ranting about how blacks have to kill white babies in their cribs and the cops in the vicinity just lollygag around paying no heed.</p>
<p>If you go any further east on the L line and you are officially entering Africa. </p>
<p>This guy seemed kind of like an idiot. There is no sense in intervening if black males are beating on their own women. If you step in, the woman who was just being beaten literally seconds ago will join her &#8220;man&#8221; in clawing and stomping on you after you just tried to help her.</p>
<p>If you are going to play Rambo and confront a pack of em, you can&rsquo;t give a a guy a wimpy little shove like this guy did. Either throw a haymaker or back down. Don&rsquo;t start a fight you are clearly going to lose.</p>

<i>Long live Bernie Goetz</i></p>
<p>I agree. </p>
<p>Lilian Rubin&rsquo;s &#8220;Quiet Rage: Bernie Goetz in a Time of Madness&#8221; is a completely engrossing account of the Goetz episode despite her expected general orientation. </p>
<p>What struck me most in her account was that immediately after the event there was a great release of feeling among NY City&rsquo;s beleaguered subway riders (the city was in a long period of elevated crime), a fierce joy that someone had at last stood up to the crime and harassment on the city&rsquo;s subways.</p>
<p>That explosion of feeling subsided in time and didn&rsquo;t result in imitations of Goetz&rsquo;s act, but one can imagine that in the more strained circumstances that may lie ahead, and event like Goetz&rsquo;s might not only release a huge public feeling but might also activate further actions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that the anti-Whites are going to just have their way with us until the last of us has been bred or bludgeoned out of existence. That is NOT going to happen. It&rsquo;s inconceivable that the small numbers of us who post on these sites are the only Whites in this country who are bursting with rage at what&rsquo;s being done to us.</p>
<p>The MAIN thing holding us back from effectively opposing the White Genocide that is in progress against us is the very effective system of terror, terror of loss of our livelihoods, that the anti-Whites have put in place to keep Whites from speaking up and protesting the racial &#8220;indignities&#8221; of our daily school life, work life, life in public spaces, etc.</p>
<p>When Gorbachev lifted the Soviet system of terror (the terror of being hauled away in the night and getting a bullet in the back of the head, or of being sent to the Gulag), the Soviet system collapsed almost immediately!</p>
<p>My own efforts to undermine the terror system that&rsquo;s in place in the West are focused on overturning that system&rsquo;s terminology and concepts that are the daily glue that keeps that system in place. That glue is first and foremost the false concept of &#8220;racism&#8221; (false because it pretends that racial feelings are a learned pathology rather than a biologically evolved survival mechanism). The r-word is at the very center of the terror system&rsquo;s ideology and power.</p>
<p>By the same means that the anti-White ideology and terminology was erected, which was constant, aggressive repetition in every place possible, we may establish our own terminology and ideology, by naming our enemies as the anti-Whites they are and waking Whites up to the anti-Whites&rsquo; program of White Genocide!</p>
<p>Please use wherever you can the pro-White phrases &#8220;anti-White,&#8221; &#8220;White Genocide,&#8221; and <i>&#8220;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White,&#8221;</i> until the public thinks in terms of these phrases as reflexively as it now thinks in terms of the r-word!</p>
<p>A unified message delivered with a few (rather than a variety of) simple terms that inherently carry that message is what changes most human minds. Advertisers have understood that since the 1950s. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;I was very angry at these guys, but I understand they come from a tough environment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Jail won&rsquo;t help them. They need to learn how to give back to the community instead of always taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re way beyond learning about &#8220;how to give back to the community.&#8221;  Too, as blacks they have an inbred propensity toward violence and a lack of consideration or feeling towards others, as is typical in a primitive jungle environment among those who have not yet evolved beyond a stone-age mentality.</p>
<p>And the women videoing the incident are the same, just another part of a gene pool that has been introduced to civilization long before they were suited for it.  Hundreds of videos every year prove this to be true.<br>

		<p>As Calieo notes, the L train is one of the only subway lines that does NOT go near Times Squares.  It&rsquo;s an obscure line that no one would get on if they didn&rsquo;t know where they were going.  It&rsquo;s not plausible that anyone would get off in Brownsville or somewhere and be shocked at all the black people   &mdash;   everyone who lives in NYC knows the neighborhoods at the east end of that line are all black and dangerous.  That whole comment is pretty suspicious   &mdash;   it also blames the victims and goes on an irrelevant rant about OWS.  It sounds like a liberal parodying what he/she thinks &#8220;racists&#8221; are supposed to say.</p>

		<p>Just another example of why all AmRen&rsquo;ers should support gun organizations that are fighting for &#8220;Shall Issue&#8221; of concealed carry permits around the nation. </p>
<p>Also, all AmRen&rsquo;ers should support pro-death penalty organizations too. </p>
<p>Bad Guys have got to learn that &#8220;a life of crime&#8221; will be very short   &mdash;   either because they make &#8220;an error in the victim selection process&#8221; and get shot (and hopefully killed since you-know-who will be paying for their medical and therapy bills&hellip;), or they&rsquo;ll get caught and executed. (Assuming we get back to executing people for plain old murder and for being habitual criminals (vs &#8220;3 strikes and you get free lifetime room, board, and medical care&hellip;.&#8221;).</p>

		<p>I agree with some of the other posters. This is why the country needs to be re-segregated. There were reasons for the Jim Crow laws in the US and there was a reason for Apartheid in South Africa&hellip;the Whites then were spiritually and racially healthy then, with a healthy outlook and understand of race. They KNEW that attacks such as this would become common place and they KNEW that this would be the end result of all this &#8220;mixing&#8221; as a result of ending the much needed systems of Jim Crow and Apartheid. </p>
<p>I think it should be mandatory that all the brainwashed, libtard cultural Marxist Whites be FORCED to live in black neighborhoods for no less than a year&hellip;if they can live through the experience then they are permitted back into a White area. That will sober them up mighty quick. I just love how traitors like Bill Clinton and the rest can say they &#8220;look forward to the day when America will have a non-White majority&#8221; yet they will NOT live in a non-White majority neighborhood. The fact is that even they don&rsquo;t really believe the lies they tell&hellip;even they KNOW that racially &#8220;diverse&#8221; areas are hell holes to avoided. They just want all the middle class and poorer Whites to &#8220;soak up&#8221; all the &#8220;wonderful&#8221; diversity that cultural Marxism has brought to us. <br>

		<p>When will stupid, brainwashed whites realize that sociopathy is much more widespread in blacks than whites.  in short, they don&rsquo;t care about other people, and if not restricted-do as they please. Still don&rsquo;t believe it-just last week, (quickly dropped by Yahoo News) a news story came out about how a sociopathic black male tortured his five kids in Indianapolis, Indiana, and killed one while his mother who lived in the same house, simply watched and did nothing. Luckily, the city threw them both in jail.  Too many blacks are simply not normal-get used to it.</p>

<p>The reason Singapore is DIVERSE and NONWHITE while having NO CRIME is that 1) Singapore has very strict laws and don&rsquo;t hesitate to lynch criminals and 2) Singapore is mostly Asians from different Asian countries. Funny how there&rsquo;s NO racial tensions between the Chinese, Indians, Koreans, and Malaysians despite the differences in appearance and language. </p>

<p>There is tremendous racial friction and resentments in Malaysia between the Malays and the Chinese. I can&rsquo;t speak to Singapore, but that is one small city-state on one tiny island. You are right that there is very little crime there. I would mention though, that in addition to its very harsh rules and laws, which I support by the way, Singapore is almost totally devoid of Africans and blacks. How much crime and violence do you think there would be in America if its black population was nil?</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s also because Singapore went through a period of British rule   &mdash;   just like Sureesh&rsquo;s old stomping grounds, India. Without the British, you Indians would still be forcing your widows to jump into funeral pyres (&#8220;suttee&#8221;); practicing graft and corruption as a way of life; plus Shiva-only-knows how many other disagreeable and antiquated holdovers from your region&rsquo;s primitive past. If not for all those mean awful pasty-faced Limeys that Hollywood loves to make fun of, the subcontinent and everybody in it   &mdash;   including you   &mdash;   would mentally and technologically still be stuck around 1600 AD. Yes, you&rsquo;re civilized   &mdash;   but a large measure of that civilization was FORCED </p>
<p>So how about this, Sureesh? I&rsquo;ll concede your (endlessly repeated) claim that East Asians and Indians (Hindus only, not Muslims) are superior in intelligence, behavior, etc, to blacks and hispanics   &mdash;   and you admit that European colonizations of Asian countries forced a Great Leap Forward upon Asians like yourself that was ultimately very beneficial to you? Can you admit that the white man&rsquo;s influence in your part of the world brought you subcontinentals forward a few centuries? Or are you just another Brown Supremacist?</p>
<p>Regardless of your answer, I hope you find what you&rsquo;re looking for in Singapore. From what I&rsquo;ve read about it, it sounds like my kind of place: clean, safe, orderly, and with an old-fashioned respect for authority no longer found here in the decadent, Frankfurtered West. And their criminal-justice system still allows for corporal punishment, such as caning, which to me is another big plus for the place. </p>

<p>This story makes my evening! And isn&rsquo;t it a hopeful story! It shows the potential that&rsquo;s simmering under the surface to reverse the anti-Whites&rsquo; program of White Genocide.</p>
<p>In the book I recommended upthread, Lillian Rubin sure didn&rsquo;t pretty him up, and I rightly or wrongly took her psychological &#8220;trashing&#8221; of him (does psychological analysis ever do anything else? That&rsquo;s something to consider right there, as one of the zillion ways we&rsquo;re demoralized to facilitate White Genocide) to probably be pretty accurate in its way, but when she was finished I liked him all the more! Just a White man who had friggin&rsquo; had eNUFF! </p>
<p>The &#8220;youths&#8221; of course got the standard velvet glove treatment. No deep probing into their psyches as I recall.</p>
<p>If we ever manage to throw off the anti-Whites&rsquo; terror system that has us immobilized, and reverse their program of White Genocide, we should build a monument to Goetz. I can think of a couple of Memorials that could be demolished to make room for it.</p>

<p>Yes. Psychological analysis of all sorts today treats every subject who comes under its purview as a tangle of unpleasant deficiencies, no matter how fine a gentleman or lady, with whatever exceptional abilities and qualities, the person might be. </p>
<p>One can imagine psychologies that would explore the same matters that present psychologies explore where those matters have some validity, but which were framed from a point of view of respect for and appreciation of the strength we all bring to the challenge of living, rather than framed from a desire to undermine us and tear us down.</p>
<p>But as you say, such psychologies would not serve the anti-Whites&rsquo; program of making us feel bad about ourselves and facilitating White Genocide.</p>
