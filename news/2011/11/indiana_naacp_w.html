<h1><a href="https://www.bet.com/news/national/2011/11/21/indiana-naacp-wants-probe-into-school-discipline.html">Indiana NAACP Wants Probe into School Discipline</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Naeesa Aziz, BET, November 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The call to action comes after the group reviewed discipline data for one county and discovered that schools with the largest African-American populations suspended Black students twice as often than would be expected based on population.</p>
<p>In addition, the group also found that the Black students were often disciplined for &#8220;attitude problems&#8221; like insubordination, while white students were typically only disciplined for specific offenses such as drug possession or vandalism. Although a 2004 state law prohibits disproportionate discipline, its mandate is discretionary and does not require any specific action from schools to stem the problem.</p>
<p>Carole Craig, NAACP education co-chairman and former Indiana Public School principal, says that regardless of the law, schools should step up to the plate to ensure discrimination is not allowed to continue unchecked. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Craig says that the NAACP is not asking for the legislation to be changed, but rather for schools to develop more awareness of cultural differences that can come across as disrespect. To assist in the process, she says that the organization has set up outreach programs in some schools to help students understand what behavior is considered acceptable.</p>

		<p>Interesting perspective - now disrespectful, rude, and disruptive behavior can be categorized a cultural trait, which may not require correction or discipline.</p>
<p>And guess who displays these tendencies?  Why, young blacks!  And to think we whites always thought orderly and respectful behavior was essential for good academic performance.</p>
<p>Just another absurd shibboleth exploded.</p>

		<p>Well if state law prohibits disproportionate discipline, let&rsquo;s show some consistency. Let&rsquo;s release some of the &#8220;disproportionately disciplined&#8221; black men from prison tomorrow whether or not they&rsquo;ve served their sentences, and let&rsquo;s them enjoy their furlough in a public housing project built adjacent to the neighborhood where the state legislators who enacted this nonsense lay their heads at night.</p>

		<p>Those of us who grew up in Indiana government schools are well aware of the problem: Blacks gone wild. </p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>Half of all homicides in America are committed by young black males who comprise about 2.5 percent of the population. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the math.</p>
<p>I read in Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s new book that half of all homicides in America are committed by blacks who comprise 12 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Consider that nearly all homicides are committed by males, we can assume that half of all homicides are committed by black males, or six percent of the population.</p>
<p>However, we also note that 93.2 of homicides are committed by individuals between the ages of 18 and 49. That age group represents about 40 percent of the black male population. 40 percent of 6 percent is 2.4 percent. </p>
<p>We conclude, then, that half all homicides are committed by 2.5 to 3.0 percent of the population, black males between the ages of 18 and 49. </p>

<p>Okay, do you want a list?  Here is one for starters:</p>
<p>Acceptable Behavior = paying attention, engaging in light chatter but quiet when requested, respect for one&rsquo;s elders (teachers and administrators), respect for each other (the students), neat dress, cleanliness, clear speech, eye contact, self-control, and a generally positive attitude.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Behavior = talking over other people, loudness, inattention to directives, sloppiness in work and dress, dirtiness, gutter talk, indirectness, any show of violence, and a generally negative attitude.  ALL of these show DISRESPECT.</p>
<p>I very much would like to know what Craig/the NAACP is referring to when she says &#8220;cultural differences&#8221;.  Is she admitting that there is something about the behavior of the black students that, because of their color or culture, fall under the above-outlined &#8220;Unacceptable Behavior&#8221; category?  This is about all I can cull from her statement.  If I were influential in Indiana schools, I&rsquo;d definitely ask that question and if it got me fired or otherwise ostracized, so be it. </p>

		<p>Yeah, because everyone knows that &#8220;disrespecting&#8221;, or to the urbanically uninformed, &#8220;dissin&rsquo;&#8221; is the biggest crime you can commit against a considerable portion of the black ghetto community. If you sneer at their sneakers or their clothes, that is disrespect. If you tell them nice gold chain, now why don&rsquo;t you get some real gold sometimes, they call that disrespect. If you see one with an eye-catching beautiful White girl, and tell them, good job brother, way to &#8220;keep it real&#8221;, that&rsquo;s disrespect. <br>
My point is, insults that would roll off of most White folks&rsquo; backs, they act like we burned down their house, and stole their car, and never insult one of their mamas. Then you are gonna need a loaded weapon to defend yourself.</p>
<p>But I just brush it off as some of them having not evolved out of the tribal age in evolution. But dat be rayciss, right?</p>

		<p>  This article shows another problem with &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; -<br>
When there is more than one culture there are no definite and consistent standards.<br>
  If discrimination is forbidden then if there are no exclusively white oriented organizations sponsored by the school then forbid all black, hispanic, Indian,etc. groups without excuse or exception. Once that is done punish all violations of the rules and fire all school officials and teachers who complain that they must punish too many minorities. When punishment is sure and quick then and only then will the misbehaviour cease.<br>

		<p>Awareness of cultural differences?  How about awareness of the teacher&rsquo;s cultural difference?  Or the time-proven culture of cooperation, respect for authority and delayed gratification?  At some point this diversity holiness will realize that there are cultures and behaviors that are not productive and even some that are destructive.  AND gads, that other cultures are productive and socially more cooperative and secure.  <br>
To heavily paraphrase some unknown pundit of yore, &#8220;There are but a few ways to be successful in life, but an infinite number of ways to ruin&#8221;.  There is only so much a school teacher can do to control and correct bad behavior.  And all of us can remember how, in our youth,  a single person could disrupt an entire class.<br>
Let the facts tell the administrators as it is.  That some kids are from tough backgrounds, and it is unjust to destroy the learning environment of an earnest class of well behaved kids.  The fact that those problem kids are of color is not racism practiced by the authroties, but evidence of a problem that has been  experienced since the beginning of modern history.  </p>

<p>Any such effort is doomed. We&rsquo;re being flooded with non-Whites like every other White country is, and it&rsquo;s the behavior and genes of the non-Whites that will spread into every corner of all White lands and mark the Genocide of the White race.</p>

		<p>If there is a state law that forbids &#8220;disproportionate discipline&#8221;, is there also a law that forbids disproportionate misbehavior?  If disrespect for authority is a cultural right for Blacks, why can&rsquo;t Whites claim intolerance for ignorance as our cultural right?  Wouldn&rsquo;t any reasonable person, not a member of the NAACP, expect that schools with higher Black populations would have more students suspended?  Nieghborhoods with the highest Black populations have the highest crime rates.  If Black students need to be tought what acceptable behavior is, maybe the NAACP should spend their time and money teaching them insted of demanding that the taxpayers foot the bill for something Black youths need to learn at home in the first place.</p>

<p>As an educator with almost 40 years experience in urban and suburban settings, I can assert that most white students are NOT insubordinate to adults, therefore it&rsquo;s obvious why they are generally not disciplined for this type of infraction.  Black students, on the other hand, are GENERALLY disrespectful of all types of authority   &mdash;   even black adults.  If I had a penny for ever time I heard, &#8220;You ain&rsquo;t my daddy!&#8221;  I&rsquo;ve always wanted to say, &#8220;because you don&rsquo;t have one!&#8221;   &mdash;   knowing I&rsquo;d be right more than 50% of the time. And the white, male authority figure, despite any and all attempts to help them, is the &#8220;enemy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Disproportionate discipline may refer to the same punishment for the same infraction, rather than different punishments for different ethnic groups.  For instance, if a student talks in class, a teacher shouldn&rsquo;t simply scold one pupil but detain another after school.  <br>
The NAACP is an anachronism which makes it into print simply because it&rsquo;s black-oriented.  It&rsquo;s about as meaningful as the Flat Earth Society.  The organization accomplishes nothing except heightened resentment of whites for blacks and the deepening of the impression that even prominent blacks are not very bright.<br>
Give black schools back to blacks.  The paddles will probably come back out and start swinging away, but the NAACP will have nary a comment.</p>

		<p>Deja vu in the Anglo-Saxon motherland.<br>
Teachers at first were told it would be racist to take notice of the different races in the classroom, and then told it would be racist not to do so.<br>
Disruption has its multicultural features: west Indians suck their teeth, Sikhs refuse to sit next to Muslims, etc.<br>
Black teachers are best with black youths so long as they can get away with traditional disciplines despite white-liberal authorities. <br>
Hardly anyone likes trying to teach the black gang types that now infest urban state secondaries, though the white marxist &#8220;teachers&#8221; see them as cannot fodder against the &#8220;system&#8221;.<br>
Meanwhile, the school inspectors blame teachers not pupils for poor educational outcomes in sink schools with a disruptive and low-IQ intake; adding insult to injury.<br>
The US is relatively luckier in one respect: you have free speech.<br>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a problem for Indiana. I see they are having the same problem in many states. The IQ difference is part of the problem (read The Bell Curve by R.Hermstein), the other part is lack of parenting. Too many black parents (?) instill racism in their children from birth.</p>

		<p>   All races instill amongst their own the desire to further themselves amongst the other races, all except the white race. I cannot understand why whites will fall for the mass-media assaults upon their people. Why is it that whites feel so guilty for past transgression, both real and imagined, against other races by our ancestors? Have we not spent trillions of dollars to try and bring other races up to our standards of living? I, for one, refuse to believe the m.s.m. lies about our people. I refuse to cower to other races. And most importantly, I place my people above all others. It is what I am supposed to do. I am white, and I am proud.  Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.</p>

<p>1) How about a Probe to investigate why the NAACP still refers to, ahem, &#8216;African-Americans&rsquo; as &#8216;Colored People&rsquo;.</p>
<p>2) &#8216;twice as often than would be expected based on population&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why would one expect all things to shake out &#8216;based on population.&rsquo;? In fact virtually nothing does. Normal honest rational people know that.</p>
<p>3) &#8216;for schools to develop more awareness of cultural differences that can come across as disrespect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, now things don&rsquo;t shakes out &#8216;based on population&rsquo;. There is the element of &#8216;cultural differences&rsquo; affecting behaviors &#8216;that can come across as disrespect.&rsquo; Maybe these &#8216;cultural differences&rsquo; explain a lot of other behaviors that don&rsquo;t shake out &#8216;based on population&rsquo; (like, just for example, the race constituting 12-13% of Americans committing 53% of the murders)</p>

<p>I was once the only White in an all black clerical unit of a major hospital.  My co workers were basic blacks, women were welfare to work slugs, men recruited out of the probation and parole offices.</p>
<p>We were always getting phone calls from payers and providers.  My co-workers screeched at each other all day long and could be heard across the street.  Nurses and other clerical workers came to our unit all day long.</p>
<p>They were hundreds of complaints about the noise and filthy language (ebonic speech has n****r and mofa every other word).<br>
The welfare to work black female supervisors held numerous meetings about the filthy language.  After the hospital sent spies around to check things out, it was revealed that the blacks did not know that the words they spewed out all day long were considered obscene by the insurance company and medical employees who called us all day long.</p>
<p>One day the chief fundraiser for the hospital was giving a tour to very wealthy big donors and ventured into our floor.  The screeched obscentities could be heard all over.</p>
<p>They finally got rid of the blacks after that and hired American born hispanics.  The hospital has a policy against hiring Whites except for a few White woman Drs.</p>

White people need to start agitating for whites-only schools, where white culture is taught,  as part of the reparations owed us for the American Holocaust.  Then black schools, etc., could impose whatever level of discipline they choose.
