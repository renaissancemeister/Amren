<h1><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/11/01/britain-to-roll-out-us-style-anti-gang-programs/">Britain to Roll Out U.S.-Style Anti-Gang Programs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Britain will roll out programs pioneered in the United States to tackle gang violence as part of the country&rsquo;s response to summer riots in which hundreds of young people committed arson, looting and attacks on police officers, the government said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Though a government report released last week showed that fewer than one in 10 people arrested for riot-linked crimes were gang members, Britain&rsquo;s Home Secretary Theresa May said 10 million pounds ($16 million) would be used to guide young people away from crime in 30 of the country&rsquo;s worst affected areas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. experts point to the success of public meetings in which police, probation workers, welfare providers and community residents confront gang members, including those yet to be convicted of any crime, and warn of a tough line  &mdash;  while offering help with healthcare and employment for those who turn their backs on violence.</p>
<p>The approach has been credited with delivering sharp drops in gang-related killings in Boston, Chicago and Cincinnati.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A national study by the Home Office has estimated that about 6 percent of all boys and girls aged 10 to 19  &mdash;  or around 50,000 people  &mdash;  are members of gangs.</p>
<p>Britain has already pledged to work with 120,000 of the country&rsquo;s most troubled families, aiming to ensure they and their children are steered away from a life of crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>May also said Britain will spend 1.2 million pounds ($2 million) to help young woman she said are increasingly becoming the victims of gang-related rapes.</p>
<p>Women who are the partners of gang members are being sexually assaulted by those allied with rival gangs, she said.</p>

<p>And they will fail, just as they&rsquo;ve failed here.  Until someone is willing to accept the real   &mdash;   and obvious   &mdash;   cause of the problem, any &#8220;solution&#8221; is nothing more than a ritual pantomime.<br>

<p>That was a Daily Mail story all by itself:</p>

<p><i>The approach has been credited with delivering sharp drops in gang-related killings in Boston, Chicago and Cincinnati.</i></p>
<p>I think other things would explain this.  The crack epidemic wearing itself out, harsher prison sentences, more skilled use of strategic law enforcement, or maybe out and out right statistical legerdemain.</p>

		<p>Apparrently, the Brits failed to red the 2011 FBI Gang Activities Report.  They are buying into a bureaucratic solution that will do nothing but allow the harboring of more immigrant populated gangs that will continue to prey on white Brits and ruin their country. It won&rsquo;t take long and it isn&rsquo;t taking long.</p>

		<p>I recall going to a gang awareness training, and, wait for it, black gangs were started, made popular, etc. by white guys, especially Norman Lear (notorious liberal)with his All in the Family and The Jeffersons,  and Lee Iaccocca (spelling?) who hung around with Snoop Dogg. We were assured that the hard core gang members would have been thugs with or without gangs, there were fringe members, and lil tykes who were just wannabees, and not dangerous at all. <br>
Oh, adn the shoe designers, and the sports uniform makers reinforced the gang mentality&hellip;.nothing whatsoever to do with black &#8220;culture&#8221; or community. White guys and Capitalism are to blame. It&rsquo;s got to be true  &mdash;  black cops told me so.</p>

		<p>Oh great, more failed policies from the U.S. instead of getting at the real root of the problem, non-white takeover of the country. Yes whites too do fall into gangs, but how many white gangs do we hear about depcapiating peoples heads and dumping them on the street out of garbage bags? Seems the gangs have proliferated in lockstep with so-called anti-gang programs, and I believe this is by design, not coincidence.</p>

		<p>I moved to Europe for good on the day of the O.J. Simpson verdict.</p>
<p>I was still a brain-dead liberal on race issues, but it was crystal clear to me that the black jury had NOT voted &#8220;innocent.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were congratulating O.J. Simpson for exterminating to white people. <br>
They were voting in favor of blacks brutally slaughtering whites in the streets of the country.</p>
<p>That was the day I realized that black-white relations in US will never improve, the most we can hope for is white enclaves where we can live in peace.</p>
<p>By the mid-90s, Europe had begun to deteriorate due to Third World immigration, but living here was still like taking a time trip back to 1950s America:</p>
<p>practically no crime, a sense of civic pride, young people who literally leapt from their bus and subway seats to offer them to the elderly. </p>
<p>If someone smoked on the subway or cross against the red or dropped trash in the street, someone, usually in a older woman, would admonish him or her loudly .</p>
<p>Now, people shrink back in terror in public places, afraid to interact for fear of being attacked physically.</p>
<p>Burglaries in my city have increased 40% this year alone.</p>
<p>When I moved to Europe, the stupid, clueless white Europeans would ask me in wonderment:</p>
<p>why is this so much crime and poverty in the United States?</p>
<p>Now they have their own dysfunctional underclass, imported directly from the Muslim world, the most violent from Africa.</p>
<p>Most Europeans understand exactly what is going on, but it would take a concerted political action to break through the wall of lies put up by governments and media.</p>

		<p>These US style anti-gang methods haven&rsquo;t worked for us. What makes Britain think they will work there? Sounds like a scam operation to me.</p>

<p>I was one of those probation officers.  It did not work anywhere in the United States.  It won&rsquo;t work anywhere in the world. Those programs were nothing but full employment programs for White hard left college grads ineligible for goverment jobs because they were White.  They tended to use their offices, phones, and computers for various hard left causes and election campaigns.  How do you think people like Tom Haydon, Bobby Seal and others got elected? </p>
<p>Not to offend the amren christians, but there is one and only one way to bring down the crime rate.  Abortion clinics in black and hsipanic neighborhoods and social workers to give rides and encouragement to the females with future criminals of America in their wombs.</p>
<p>A massive wall on our southern border and mass deportation of hispanics and anchor babies before the anchor babies grow up will also bring the crime rate way, way down</p>

<p>Do you live in Germany? The goverment offices in S. California just about closed down because 1. the blacks loudly celebrated the verdict. 2. most of the goverment employees were black.</p>
