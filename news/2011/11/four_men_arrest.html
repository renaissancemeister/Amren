			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Duncan Gardham, Telegraph (London), November 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The four men  &mdash;  three aged 19 and one aged 24  &mdash;  are accused of raising funds for terrorism and travelling to Pakistan for terrorist training.</p>
<p>The men were arrested in connection with a &#8220;major counter-terrorism investigation&#8221; known as Operation Pitsford.</p>
<p>The men were detained by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit at their home addresses in the Sparkhill area of the city early on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>A spokesman for West Midlands Police said the arrests were &#8220;pre-planned&#8221; and armed officers were not involved.</p>
<p>All four are being held under the Terrorism Act 2000 and detectives have an initial 48 hours to question the suspects before charging, releasing or applying for a warrant of further detention.</p>
<p>Eight people arrested over the last two months have already been charged. Three are alleged to have been plotting a suicide bombing campaign of &#8220;mass murder&#8221; on the streets of Britain.</p>
<p>Two of those are said to have travelled to Pakistan where they received terrorist training and made alleged suicide videos before returning to build a bomb.</p>
<p>The men were under surveillance as part of an &#8220;intelligence led operation&#8221; by MI5 and the police as they discussed their alleged plans, which were picked up by listening devices.</p>
<p>Three other men allegedly helped raise Â£12,000 by collecting for charities which was said to be used for the purposes of planning their attacks. A seventh man and a woman have been accused of failing to inform police.</p>
<p>Those previously charged include Rahin Ahmed, 25, from Moseley, Birmingham, who allegedly helped others to travel to Pakistan for training in bomb making, using weapons and mixing poisons.</p>
<p>He is also said to have collected money and invested and managed the money which was to be used for &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221; according to charges.</p>
<p>Irfan Nasser, 30, from Sparkhill, Birmingham and Irfan Khalid, 26, of Sparkbrook, Birmingham, are accused of plotting their attacks between Christmas Day last year and their arrest in September.</p>
<p>The charges say that they travelled to Pakistan for training in terrorism including bomb making, weapons and poison making.</p>
<p>While there they are said to have made a &#8220;martyrdom film&#8221; and later began planning a &#8220;suicide bombing campaign or event.&#8221;</p>
<p>On their return they allegedly provided information to others about training in Pakistan and were &#8220;advising and counselling&#8221; about explosives and detonators.</p>
<p>The men went on to purchase &#8220;components and chemicals for a home made explosive device,&#8221; the charges state and constructed a &#8220;home made explosive device for terrorist acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>They tried to recruit others for terrorist training and for terrorist acts and stated their &#8220;intention to be a suicide bomber,&#8221; prosecutors claimed.</p>
<p>Ashik Ali, 26, from Balsall Heath, Birmingham, did not travel to Pakistan, but allegedly provided premises for planning the attacks and making explosives.</p>
<p>He is said to have learned about explosives and detonators and was allegedly involved in the purchase of components and chemicals and in making a home made explosive device.</p>
<p>He too allegedly tried to recruit others for training and terrorism and stated that he wanted to be a suicide bomber.</p>

		<p>They are more likely to be Pakistanis tha Arabs.<br>
 There never was particularly heavy Arab immigration into Britain.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of Arabs in London, but these men are almost certainly of Pakistani origin. Muslims from the Indian sub-continent have for some time formed the greater part of Birmingham&rsquo;s citizenry.</p>

		<p>I see little or no reason to admit Islamic or black immigrants. Those people bring problems with them, without contributing anything of obvious value. </p>
