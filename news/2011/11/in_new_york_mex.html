<p>In the past two decades, the Mexican population in New York City has grown more than fivefold, with immigrants settling across the five boroughs. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 41 percent of all Mexicans between ages 16 and 19 in the city have dropped out of school, according to census data.</p>
<p>No other major immigrant group has a dropout rate higher than 20 percent, and the overall rate for the city is less than 9 percent, the statistics show.</p>
<p>This crisis endures at the college level. Among Mexican immigrants 19 to 23 who do not have a college degree, only 6 percent are enrolled. That is a fraction of the rates among other major immigrant groups and the native-born population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The problem is especially unsettling because Mexicans are the fastest-growing major immigrant group in the city, officially numbering about 183,200, according to the Census Bureau, up from about 33,600 in 1990. Experts say the actual figure is far larger, given high levels of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unlike some other immigrant populations, like the Chinese, Mexicans have few programs for tutoring or mentoring.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many young illegal immigrants in New York City say there is no point in staying in school because their lack of legal status limits their access to college scholarships and employment opportunities. Some drop out under the erroneous belief that they are not eligible to attend college. (Illegal immigrants who graduate from a high school in New York State or earn a G.E.D. are not only allowed to attend the state&rsquo;s public university system, but are also eligible for in-state tuition.)</p>
