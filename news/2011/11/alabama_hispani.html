<h1><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/67438.html">Alabama Hispanic Students Not Coming Back</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MJ Lee, Politico, November 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Over a month after the nation&rsquo;s toughest immigration law took effect in Alabama, hundreds of Hispanic students are still missing from the state&rsquo;s public school system  &mdash;  and they are likely gone for good.</p>
<p>On Monday, a whopping 1,807 Hispanics in the state didn&rsquo;t show up to school, according to the number of student absences provided to POLITICO by the Alabama Department of Education. This is about 800 more than what was considered a normal absentee count among Hispanic youth before parts of the state&rsquo;s immigration law were approved at the end of September. On Tuesday, the number was 1,540.</p>
<p>The department&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Malissa Valdes, said the absentee figure for Hispanic students has continued to hover hundreds higher than the pre-immigration law average following an initial spike of absentees after the law kicked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a student comes to school and they fill out a form of withdrawal, they are officially withdrawn, and the school would not mark them as absent. But if the student stops showing up, we will never know and they will continue to be marked as absent [until the end of the school year],&#8221; Valdes said.</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;Administrators expressed that [some] Hispanic students left giving the reason that their parents have decided to move. You could assume that would have some impact on the permanent loss of any students.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, a few hundred absences in a state that has an estimated 35,000 Hispanic students is relatively small  &mdash;  certainly far less noticeable than the thousands of Hispanic students that didn&rsquo;t show up in school at the end of September  &mdash;  and education officials in some counties say they have hardly noticed any lingering effects.</p>

		<p>Wow!  What a wonderful Christmas gift to the taxpayers of Alabama.  Since it cost around $8,000 or more? to educate each Alabama student/yr, and since it costs way more to educate bilingual students, reducing illegal students by ~1,800 will save ~ $14,400,000.  These savings can be used to educate the children of Americans.</p>
<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!  Alabama taxpayers will pay less for medical care, policing, courts, insurance, incarceration, welfare, food stamps, Section 8 housing, and crime and exotic tropical diseases will decline.  </p>
<p>Best of all, the jobs that these illegals stole from Americans will be available to the many, many American citizens who are out of work.  Hopefully, the greedy businesses will have to pay their new American citizen workers a fair wage, instead of the slave-wages paid to the illegals.  This is a win - win   &mdash;   win situation for all Americans.</p>
<p>This is the way to put Americans back to work.</p>

		<p>So much of the behavior of blacks and browns depends on their perception of whites&rsquo; response, and here is a prime example.  Illegal Hispanics have yet to become as brazen as American blacks and thus fear bad reactions from whites.  They don&rsquo;t even want to be around when the fur starts flying.  <br>
Obama and Holder have created an atmosphere where blacks believe they can swarm down streets threatening white people.  It&rsquo;s much like what happened after emancipation, after the 60&rsquo;s civil rights bills, and now after Obama&rsquo;s election.  In the first two instances, reactions of the police and vigilante groups quelled lawless blacks.  Hopefully, Obama will be out of office in 2013, and an attitude adjustment will occur.</p>

		<p>The only reason schools are worried is less federal funds. I just hope they go home and not to the closest state. I know hope in one hand&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Im sure none of them went back to Mexico, they just moved to the next state, or maybe they went to California. California loves illegals, the more the merrier.</p>

		<p>The article states that normally 1000 Hispanic students are absent on any given day. On Tuesday an extra 540 students were gone (out of an estimated 35,000) - and this is newsworthy? That&rsquo;s right, between 1 and 2 percent of Alabama&rsquo;s Hispanics have left the state. I&rsquo;m surprised anyone noticed. For all I know that could be close to a normal fluctuation for migrant workers now that growing season is coming to an end.</p>

		<p>I grew up in a small town that was&hellip;.&rdquo;vanilla&rdquo; in hue. I went into the Army after graduation. Came home after a 4 year hitch and thought I&rsquo;d been mistakenly dropped off in Mexico City.</p>
<p>I also live close to the border. The CANADIAN Border.</p>
