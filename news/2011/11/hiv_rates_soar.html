<h1>HIV Rates Soar Among Young Black Men</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arthur Touchot, Medill, November 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New HIV infections among young black men who have sex with men have increased nearly 50 percent between 2006 and 2009 in the U.S., according to a recent study. </p>
<p>The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that African-American men had the highest rate of new HIV infections of all groups in 2009. Their rate of infection was more than 2 ½ times that of the next highest groups, Hispanic men and African-American women. </p>
<p>According to the study, new infections among black men who have sex with men aged 13 to 29 increased from 4,400 cases in 2006 to 6,500 cases in 2009. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The CDC study said reasons for the increase are not fully known, but may include an already high prevalence of HIV among black men who have sex with men, as well as societal factors, such as the stigma of HIV and homosexuality, limited access to health care, and poverty. </p>

		<p>How is the &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;maleducation&#8221; of a 13-year old black &#8220;man&#8221; relevant to his contracting HIV/AIDS?  A 13-year old is not a man, he is a seventh grader.  And sex with him in almost every state in the union has a fancy legal name:  Statutory Rape.</p>

		<p>I work in a prison.  Most black males find male sexual partners very acceptable and not just because they&rsquo;re in prison.  It&rsquo;s a legitimate choice among the race. They&rsquo;re also are the vast majority of sexual predators with their first preference being young white males of slight build. Then slightly built black males, and then it&rsquo;s anyone several of them can overpower, preferably white.  Anal sex among blacks, either with females or males, provides satisfaction for them.  </p>
<p>Lack of access to health care?  Nonsense.  When free or locked up, they freely choose with impunity   &mdash;   off taxpayers.   </p>

		<p>Every AIDS patient I have ever treated was black.  The city is only 7 percent black.  We have a large number of gays.  I have never treated a White AIDS patient.  That means that White gay men have low rates of AIDS.</p>

<p>Poverty causes HIV infections?  One side of my family is desperately poor.  They are laid-off factory workers and miners living in an economically-wrecked rural area.  They can barely gas their cars, heat their homes or feed themselves, but they&rsquo;re too proud to go on government assistance.  They have no particular &#8220;access to healthcare&#8221; beyond aspirin from the grocery store.  </p>
<p>Guess how many of them have HIV?  NONE!!  What a mystery&hellip;<br>

		<p>Pansexuality. Its definition has been altered lately to mean gender is not a consideration. Its former meaning also included sexual intercourse with children, family members, and other species. Nothing is exempt.</p>
<p>All you have to do is look at the rape report statistics to know blacks commit the majority of them. And if psychologists were allowed to tell the truth without being fired, I&rsquo;m sure there is also a larger percentage of black pansexuals.</p>
<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t believe the reasons given in this article as to why young black men have a higher rate of HIV. The CDC knows these reasons are bogus as well. But like any government funded institution, they would be fired if they told the truth. This article is just more propaganda shoved down our throats. </p>

<p>What sane people have a 70+% bastardy rate? What sane people vote a $500 million bond issue for &#8220;education&#8221; they have absolutely no intention or ability to pay back as Detroit has done? What sane people cuts body parts off of infants to make juju or muti? What sane people believes that you can cure AIDS by raping the guts out of newborn babies? What sane people believes that you can cure AIDS with garlic and beet root (like the South African minister of Health)?</p>
<p>Gay Black Man, you may be right that no &#8220;sane persons&#8221; would deliberately get AIDS, but who in their right mind believes that most blacks are sane? We are not talking about sane people here, we are talking about most blacks. And collectively they have a completely different logic.</p>

<p>My all time favorite &#8220;who are we to argue with black science&#8221; cure for HIV/AIDS:  Showering under holy water.  Here&rsquo;s the catch:  Men must be completely naked and chained together (slavery imagery, anyone?), while women are allowed to wear crotch area panties, but nothing above the waste.</p>
<p>It came out of Uganda, IIRC.</p>
<p>This must be some pretty potent, gender-aware, sharp-visioned and intelligent holy water. It must know that it is only allowed to cure a man&rsquo;s AIDS if he is completely naked while receiving the touch of the drops, and only allowed to cure a woman&rsquo;s AIDS if she is wearing nothing more than panties.</p>

<p>There are actually gay men called &#8220;bug chasers&#8221; that seek the HIV/AIDS virus from &#8220;gift givers&#8221; (infected men) at conversion parties.  Not saying its a widely practiced thing, but it happens.</p>

<p>One catastrophic problem of combating HIV is that a person who is HIV-positive and receiving medication is still able to infect other people.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; you give medicine to people who have HIV that prolongs their life, giving those people ample opportunity to spread what they have to others&hellip;<br>
and the CDC is shocked that HIV has increased? </p>
<p><i>Blacks are purposefully seeking infection because it is a one hundred percent reliable method of getting a high paying free ride in welfare dollars.</i></p>
<p>Full Social Security Disability + meds for a lifetime IF a person &lsquo;gets&rsquo; the virus   &mdash;   HIV/AIDS patients are one of the left&rsquo;s new protected classes, and you can be sure HIV/AIDS patients will never be brought up under obamacare&rsquo;s death panels.</p>
<p>But those with the rare CCR5 Delta-32 mutation (1% of the population) will be hunted down and sucked dry to use as a possible cure.</p>

		<p>This is a very serious issue. A large number of these black men infected or not  sooner or later will end up having unprotected sex with white women. White men should really be careful who they have sex with and choose as a partner.</p>

One wonders if there&rsquo;s more at issue in all this than just <br>
low IQ.  Among pockets of dull whites, one seldom if ever encounters all this odd &#8220;voodoo&#8221; sort of ideation.  It is<br>
relevant to note that the Catholic Church in Africa has been<br>
unable for decades and decades to get all manner of bizarre<br>
ideation removed on an enduring basis from Catholic Churches<br>
in Africa.<br>

<p>Yeah, and for Martians, too. Unfortunately we live in real life, where blacks are known to engage in risky (i.e. protection-free) sex at higher rates than other races.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you aren&rsquo;t as disciplined. Of course you don&rsquo;t behave like Whites, only a brainwashed zombie would think otherwise. Why is stuff like this even news?</p>

<p>You are either new to - or woefully misinformed about - or turning a blind eye to - the phenomenon of &#8220;bug chasing&#8221; in the gay community. In fact, there ARE quite a few angry or vengeful or disordered gay/bisexual males &#8220;in the life&#8221; who are aggressively seeking to be infected with the HIV virus - and who subsequently pass this infection on to unsuspecting partners. I know; I treat these bug chasers on a regular basis and the overwhelming majority ARE African-American. If you&rsquo;re unaware of this phenomenon, I suggest you read &#8220;Deadly Bugchasing on the Internet&#8221; at BlackPressUSA.com - then start protecting yourself before you, too, end up in my office.</p>
