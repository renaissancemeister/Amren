<h1>Restoring Sanity in Education</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Kay, American Renaissance, November 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The chief aim of US public K-12 education over the last half century had been to get children in the 85 to 90 IQ range (i.e., mainly blacks and Hispanics), most of whom are poorly motivated, to perform as if they were well-motivated students with IQs of 100 or higher. Billions have been wasted on every educational gimmick imaginable, and even larger futile government expenditures are on the horizon. It is almost like drug addiction. </p>
<p>How can this be reversed?  This is no small task, given the powerful political forces pushing for gap-closing, regardless of cost. Any solution requires a clear-eyed understanding of what education means to most blacks. </p>
<p>First, blacks, especially lower class blacks, generally care more about the outward appearance of &#8220;being educated&#8221; (e.g., the diploma, social prestige) than actual learning. This is why blacks often accept inflated graduation statistics and cheating on standardized tests. Many even demand diplomas for students who fail school exit exams, and promote self-esteem over actual accomplishment. Genuine academic excellence is being pushed primarily by middle-class whites and Asians.</p>
<p>Second, many blacks see schools as a source of jobs and contracts rather than as places to acquire knowledge. Jobs and contracts, moreover, are to be awarded to blacks regardless of qualifications or experience. Given a choice between a Spartan white-run school with stellar academics (even for blacks), versus an over-the-top black-run Taj Mahal with hundreds of jobs and lucrative contracts but a dismal academic record, many blacks prefer the latter. </p>
<p>Third, blacks generally are more forgiving of the traits of &#8220;bad schools&#8221; that most whites find deplorable: classroom disorder, criminality, lack of discipline, vandalism, thievery, and the like. If white administrators attempt to shutter these chaotic, violent schools, black parents typically resist. This is hardly surprising; these schools mean jobs for fellow blacks. </p>
<p>We therefore have a clash of cultures: Well-intentioned middle-class whites are trying to transform schools dominated by underclass blacks into &#8220;white&#8221; schools. Most blacks want the economic benefits of a &#8220;good education&#8221; but, alas, refuse to pay the price of attending &#8220;white&#8221; schools. They will resist reform, regardless of how whites approach the task, while white reformers refuse to realize that many (if not most) blacks refuse to understand that &#8220;education&#8221; means learning. This battle is a recipe for bankruptcy, since nothing  &mdash;  absolutely nothing  &mdash;  will produce miracles. </p>
<p>The only solution is to free &#8220;black schools&#8221; from white standards, and let blacks run them according to their own values. This is easier than one might guess  &mdash;  drastic decentralization will do the trick, and will satisfy everyone ideologically. </p>
<p>Begin by eliminating tests on which blacks perform poorly. If it is too tough politically to abandon them outright, just dumb them down so everyone passes. Or we can just tolerate cheating in black schools. </p>
<p>Likewise, stop insisting on a standard (&#8220;white&#8221;) curriculum. If blacks replace US history with African-American history, even Ebonics or Swahili, so be it. Also drop the demand for minimal literacy and numeracy. Let&rsquo;s just call this &#8220;academic freedom&#8221; (or &#8220;intellectual diversity&#8221;), and make things more palatable by stressing the importance of non-academic skills in education. </p>
<p>This solution hardly condemns blacks to an inferior education. Blacks who want a decent education for their children (and there are many) can enroll them in &#8220;white&#8221; schools.  Nor is this a return to government-imposed segregation; it simply acknowledges that groups differ in educational expectations. </p>
<p>Indeed, cultural sensitivity is ubiquitous in American education and not something to be reserved for blacks. American education in general is notable for its variety, and this is judged a virtue, not a liability. There are white schools that stress athletics over academics or give watered-down, feel-good diplomas. We have religious schools of all faiths, military schools, schools awash in progressive ideology, and schools specializing in music, art, technology, language, or vocational skills. In fact, there are already a fair number of schools (both public and private) that are explicitly &#8220;African,&#8221; and few complain.</p>
<p>Local control is a throwback to the now infamous New York City Ocean Hill-Brownville experiment during the late 1960s. With help from the Ford Foundation, the city&rsquo;s Board of Education turned over a group of schools in a black neighborhood to local blacks. The aim was to boost sorrowful black academic performance on the theory that blacks could better teach their own. The upshot was wholesale firing of white teachers, and contracts awarded to black businesses. There was corruption, cronyism, incompetence, and anti-white rhetoric. Scores on standardized tests soon declined. </p>
<p>The experiment was eventually ended due to (largely) white union opposition over the lack of due process in teacher terminations, not because the black community was upset by deteriorating schools. Conceivably, if the fired white teachers had received generous severance packages or were just re-assigned to other schools, these corrupt, inept, community-run schools would still be in existence. </p>
<p>The mechanics of updated community control are simple. Each school (or school district) would receive a lump sum for discretionary expenses based only on enrollment figures (adjustments might require extra money for disabled students as per federal law). To prevent complete collapse, the central administration would pay fixed expenses such as utilities, insurance, capital improvements and the like. Additional funds could be secured from foundations and from all those liberals who are always eager to help struggling blacks. </p>
<p>The money could be spent with the widest possible discretion, subject only to certain legal prohibitions. If black-dominated school boards want to hire unqualified black teachers, their friends and relatives, and use textbooks published by black-owned firms, no problem. Ditto for funding extravagant proms versus buying science equipment. Most importantly, graduates of these schools will not be measured against &#8220;white&#8221; standards. And, truth be told, outcomes would probably resemble what already occurs when black students are forced into the Procrustean bed of &#8220;white&#8221; education. </p>
<p>White middle-class reformers will be outraged, but this solution reflects today&rsquo;s widely accepted notions of multi-culturalism and sensitivity to the needs of victimized populations. Localism also reflects school choice, and since black parents will be making the choice, white liberals will keep quiet. Other groups will benefit. Asians, for example, will reject frills and fads in favor of science and mathematics.</p>
<p>Moreover, since everybody will get <em>exactly</em> the same public educational funding, and many blacks will get exactly the kind of public education they want  &mdash;  not what whites think they should want  &mdash;  the days of limitless spending to close racial gaps will come to an end.  </p>

		<p>The solution is relatively straight forward.  Remove the fascist compulsory component of education.  If a student chooses to stay home, let them.  The bottom 3/4 of the non-white population would immediately leave school.  No difference whatsoever in their education outcome would result.  But for those that actually WANT an education, the schools would rapidly improve.</p>
<p>Note that this was the original intent of IQ testing.  To identify those who should not be in school to begin with.  Somewhere along the line, access to education became something that was a privilege, then a right, then something odious forced upon the population.</p>
<p>With regard to blacks, our society should just stop pretending.  Every black person should be given a place to live and enough money and resources to survive.  Mostly, they are given far more than that, for pretending to work&hellip;.which causes all sorts of problems.  Various checks need to be implemented to deal with black psychopathology.  For example, blacks that live together and marry should get extra money.  Drug testing should be done every month.  Those that fail have to live in alternative living situation similar to a minimum security prison (a drug legalized zone).  Those that are not married should be paid to be sterilized.  Any violent crime should result in execution.</p>
<p>A few common sense measures, most of which would be extremely popular among blacks could solve the black problem immediately through de facto segregation of the most troublesome among them with long term reduction of their population.  In essence we would pay them to live the party life they want and to disappear over the generations&hellip;.as long as they kept away from us.</p>
<p>Liberal?  Who cares what they think.  One thing the American liberal has proven over the last 50 years is he is malevolent (and hence, an enemy you should not listen to) and weak (no consequences to ignoring what they want, especially if the result is positive for everyone).</p>
<p>Sound far fetched?  Look at the way the black problem is handled in the US and you will notice, for the most part, it&rsquo;s already there. In fact, if we didn&rsquo;t have invasion from Mexico going on, I&rsquo;d think most racists would be pleased by how the black problem is being addressed&hellip;.even by Obama.</p>
<p>A lot more could be done though, much of it on the sly (or appearing to cave into the liberal agenda).  Drug legalization zones you can&rsquo;t leave for welfare people who test positive is an interesting idea.  Millions of libtards would ooze with joy over drug legalization.  But what it actually is prison for drug users.  Would they really care?</p>
<p>If I told the average black he&rsquo;d get his welfare check and he could smoke all the crack he wanted as long as stayed in Detroit, would he call me a racist and resist that?  Heck, it&rsquo;s practically like that now.  Give the man a vasectomy and watch the problem disappear for our children.</p>

		<p>How about we just raise the standards to the levels of the early 60s on EVERYONE.  If you can&rsquo;t make the grade, you fail.  If you fail, you drop out or get kicked out so as not to waste time and resources that could benefit other students with the brains and inclination to want to learn.  As much as possible, schools should be de-integrated so the historic achievement gap between different races becomes less an issue.  This would also save a lot of money.  I can&rsquo;t see letting ignorant people establish and entrench a system wherein they give out diplomas based on a substandard curriculum that substitutes learning with feeling.  If you can&rsquo;t meet a minimum standard of learning, you probably deserve a low self esteem.  This proposed system only perpetuates this fairytale of equality that has ruined not only our educational system, but our entire nation.</p>

		<p>There had better be strong white oversite, as blacks cannot govern themselves. He seems to indicate there will be, but expect a complete deterioration of the physical plant. Why repair a roof when the money can be better spent on a Kwanza celebration?</p>
<p>The city of Cleveland schools had buildings collapsing (literally) and the state of Ohio quietly bailed them out to the tune of $1 billion. If only the taxpayers knew.</p>

		<p>Dr. Huxtable, you cannot go back to the former Jim Crow world. But you can use political correctness and multiculturalism in the brilliant way set forth by Joseph Kay. True multiculturalism demands local control. Local control demands cultural and sometimes racial segregation.  Segregation of cultural communities will allow a thousand flowers to bloom or at least to grow in their own manner.  Some actually may wilt.  But it will allow those who wish to excel academically, to do so.  Local control and local autonomy of school boards to do as they will, is a truly wise and far sighted approach to so many problems. Kudos to Joseph Kay for this article.  </p>

The above is absolutely not true. Alfred Binet developed the I.Q. test primarily with the intent of using it to identify rural, low income and working class students who might be able to absorb a more advanced (university prep) education. For that purpose, it works decently well. In recent decades, the political left, for obvious reasons, has represented the purpose of the I.Q. test as indentifying, classifying and educationally placing limited learners. This was not its original purpose, but the idea has been repeated so many times that it has become fact in the minds of almost everybody. But it is not fact.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the political left does not in general want the idea that there is a strong inborn element to intelligence to have currency. Obviously, environment affects its development (or lack thereof), but environment does not move anyone to a higher level than what they are naturally endowed with. Sorry.</p>

<p>The political elite will intervene on behalf of non-whites to prevent them from having the freedom to choose failure (precisely because they would).</p>

		<p>The way I see it, the Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Ed. was a colossal mistake. Black and White kids were doing just fine learning in their own separate schools, without the pressure of having to compete with one another. Thanks to school integration that neither side really wanted, white students felt that their educational standards had to be lowered to accommodate the &#8220;low performing&#8221; black students, and black students felt unreasonably pressured into living up to the &#8220;white standards&#8221; of academic excellence.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, achieving success in the school environment (both academically and socially) has been a task onto itself for students of every race. It&rsquo;s hard enough being a student today in America&rsquo;s woefully flawed educational system. The solution that Mr. Kay proposes might work if our schools were still segregated. Forced integration definitely made things worse for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I think what needs to happen is that parents need to be realistic about their child&rsquo;s learning abilities, and use that as the basis for which school he/she can best learn in. If a black kid can really excel in a mostly white school, then that&rsquo;s where he/she ought to learn. If not, then place the child in a school (even if it is majority non-white) where he/she can realistically succeed. If the powers-that-be did what is in the best interests for kids instead of doing what makes them feel good, then students (white and black) can achieve real success in the academic world.</p>

		<p>What is needed is trade high schools instead of academic high schools and they should be 2 years only. </p>
<p>Blacks have wasted trillions in education when its genetics and this goes for the one parent homes since the parents and entire genealogy and race is of inferior IQ.</p>
<p>Teach them to be mechanics, bricklayers, carpenters, truck drivers, plumbers, electricians or other trades and only for 2 years. </p>
<p>This will save trillions in tax dollars and put them in their places although skilled trades still require a great amount of dedication.</p>
<p>If this does not work then eliminate the drop out age and do not require school as mandatory and save more trillions to reduce the debt. </p>
<p>It was a complete farce entirely to even believe the black race could match intelligence with the supreme white European race and clearly this fabrication has been proven to be a total failure.</p>
<p>Face it. Blacks are fine on a personal one on one basis at times but collectively overall its a sorry race and of inferior genetics. That gap can never be erased. </p>

		<p>Interesting that the topic of the Brown v. Topeka has come up again in these comments. A little know fact is that, very slowly, school was segregration was of its own accord dying out. By the time the Supreme Court issued &#8220;Brown&#8221;, school segregration already had ended in Kansas.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, the state of Georgia ended school segregation; undoubtedly under the pressure of &#8220;Brown&#8221;, but still voluntarily.</p>
<p>The problem with &#8220;Brown&#8221; is not what the court ruled, but the construction of the decision. The Supreme Court not only ruled school segregration unconstitutional, but accepted the validity of the &#8220;pop&#8221; psychology and &#8220;pop&#8221; sociology NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall entered into evidence in his arguments.</p>
<p>That Thurgood Marshall. In my estimation, Thurgood Marshall is right up there with Lewis Hershey and J. Edgar Hoover as one the great &#8220;mega creeps&#8221; of the era. This was a type which flourished worldwide in that era   &mdash;   men who through the accumulation of bureaucratic power and by dint of great personal effort manipulated, if not outright tortured, the lives of millions, often young people particularly. Another example in a non-government roles was long-time American amateur sports czar Avery Brundage, referred to alternately by both white and black athletes as &#8220;Slavery Brundage&#8221; or &#8220;Avery Bondage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Legal school segregation has gone the way of the dodo bird, and would have died out even without the &#8220;Brown&#8221; decision. &#8220;Brown&#8221; deserves a hard second look, but not the reason anyone here thinks. </p>

Rather than attempt the impossible we should be imposing effective - which is to say harsh - discipline on inner city schools. Students who want to learn, and who have no choice but to attend those schools, should be able to learn in safe environments. </p>

		<p>#8 Alfred Binet developed the I.Q. test primarily with the intent of using it to identify rural, low income and working class students who might be able to absorb a more advanced (university prep) education. </p>
<p>Your research into Binet&rsquo;s work is both distorted and incomplete.  The original creators of IQ testing was the US army, and was used quite successfully to identify mental defectives (that specific term is used in their literature).  Binet, for what it was worth was not interested in identifying college ready people.  As in fact, the test fails to do that&hellip;remarkably.  His intent was to separate out the ineducable.  Something his test does very well.</p>
<p>The failure here is you do not understand the difference in education then vs now.  Our high school today is what they understood back then as University prep.  Most &#8220;educated&#8221; people were taught how to read.  Could write basic letters.  And could do simple math.  That&rsquo;s it.  Especially in rural farm lands where the children were then needed to do the real work.</p>
<p>How do I know?  For my own master&rsquo;s thesis, I did metaresearch (an examination of all the research done on IQ testing up to that point), including history of the various tests, and related neuropsychological tests.  And a complex statistical analysis of a large chunk of the normative database for SB.</p>
<p>My conclusions?  These tests only identify mental defectives reliably (but also have an important place in diagnosing brain injuries), and that was what they were created for.  How well people do at various parts of the test are random (strong evidence against patterns of ability that accumulation of measures a single trait).</p>
<p>G - as a trait, does not exist.  Lots of work has been done trying to finagle that it does.  It&rsquo;s all been a failure.  From SATs that fail miserably to identify who does well in college.  To employment tests that fail to identify productivity.</p>
<p>All failures across the board.  Intelligence is characterized best by the complexity and breadth of ability and successful outcomes.  But stupidity&hellip;..stupidity is a trait.  It&rsquo;s not complex and displays extreme stereotyping.  Stupidity can be measured.  And that is what IQ testing is for.  What it was created for.</p>
<p>And in case you are wondering about the quality of my research, the resulting article passed peer review and was published 20 years ago in the respected, &#8220;Perceptual and Motor Skills&#8221;.  Something I notice these liberal researchers do not (can not) do.  </p>

<p>School was compulsory for all in France when Binet developed his test.</p>
<p>One of the reasons was to identify below 100 IQ and below 90IQ children as early as possible, before first grade.  Otherwise they would not be identified until second or third grade.</p>
<p>By having special classes for the slower kids as soon as they started school, they could learn at their own pace.  The system worked very well.  Those French special ed kids did better than the average American black.</p>

<p>Truck drivers maybe, but the other trades you mentioned need IQs of at least 95 plus the ability to work instead of goofing off all day. I have never seen a black mechanic.  Blacks generally have to transfer to some social justice class out of auto shop because they cannot read the book or preform mechanical functions.  </p>
<p>Electricians make upwards of $100,000 per year if they are IBEW commercial industrial inside wiremen. They are not illegals picked up at home depot.  </p>
<p>To even take the IBEW electricians apprenticeship exam, the applicant must show a high school diploma and transcript with a 3.00 average including Algebra 1 and 2, geometry and trigonometry with Bs in all the 4 math courses. The apprenticeship test is similiar to the navy engineering test for the nuclear submarine crews.</p>
<p>Almost no blacks and few Whites can make it into the IBEW.  IBEW electricians also work as foremen and general foremen on the big highrises. At the end of the apprenticeship course they must pass a stiff exam about building codes, blueprint reading and other information to ensure that each and every IBEW electrician can preform as general foremen building 90 story highrises. </p>

Mr. Kay has exhibited &lsquo;kicking the can down the road&rsquo; as an art form in his short essay on education.  For arguments sake, let us somehow identify those that are intellectually deficient or perhaps just don&rsquo;t care.  Further, we develop a cosmetic education system and dispense cosmetic diplomas, degrees and certificates and perhaps educational self esteem will soar?<br>
How does Mr. Kay propose we convince these persons with a cosmetic education and cosmetic paperwork that they are in fact cosmetic and can&rsquo;t move into the real world and do real tasks that reward them with a real living income?  Industry and government already struggle to accommodate many of these individuals that have passed through the &lsquo;system&rsquo; on affirmative action waivers but are incapable of producing when faced with real demanding tasks.  A formalized system of cosmetic education may produce a temporary euphoria at graduation but it won&rsquo;t help a whit in developing competent, productive individuals.   Affirmative action is required for a lifetime and even then on produces a cosmetic result!<br>

		<p>I taught English and history to whites, blacks and Asians of both genders and wide ranges of ability from 11 to 18 in British schools for over 25 years. There is much sense in many previous above posts.  I would emphasise, however, that between the ages of 4 to 8 all children should have very intensive teaching in English and mathematics, at least, in the future all round interest of society. Discipline should be rigorous, classes small, and Montessori properly understood (it is not playway) tried experimentally. So long as home schooling meets the early requirements it should be welcomed.  On average blacks and whites develop at different rates and ways, as do males and females, so there is a strong case for separate schools.</p>
<p>Later, adolescents should be allowed to leave earlier than at present, preferably into some kind of (legal!) apprenticeship. The war against drugs should not be abandoned as currently urged, and sterilization should be reconsidered to prevent or penalise totally irresponsible breeding of unhappy, neglected, abandoned or potentially criminal children.    </p>

<p>Here is an answer  R1+20o,R2=30o total resistance+10o</p>
<p>Typical question &rsquo; A grounding autotransformer is used to create a three-phase, 4-wire distribution system from a three-phase, 3-wire ungrounded system.  At what percent must the overcurrent device be set to trip in case of an overload&#8221;.</p>
<p>Note that the test taker must kow how to figure percent,  5th grade math level. The average black with an IQ of 85 is not capable of getting past very simple multiplication.</p>
<p>There is an entire chapter on special occupancies, including airplanes.</p>
<p>Would you want someone with an IQ of 85 or below wiring the plane you plan to fly?</p>

<p>This is the prejudice that vocational trainers have fought for years. <i>&#8220;If a student can&rsquo;t read or do math, send him to shop&#8221;</i>. In most vocational skills, excellent reading and mathematical abilities are essential.   </p>
<p>Mentioned above was the rigorous requirements for electricians.  The same can be said for a host of other trades as has been pointed out as well.</p>
<p>The courts have thrown out IQ tests for use in employee selection.  But they still allow other job related tests as selection instruments and these tests must be job derived.  But they still are, in really, IQ tests in disguise.    </p>
<p>Employee tests are normally not used to hire personnel who will go to work immediately and who already have the requisite skills for the job.  Employers will only verify the work record and do a police check. The testing exception would apply to &#8220;newbees&#8221; to be taught informally On the Job (OJT).   </p>
<p>Employee selection tests are not used to determine who will be productive.  Employment tests are used to select those who are likely to succeed in a basic training course.  Examples are cops, firemen, military specialties, and so on. </p>
<p>If a new employee completes training, the presumption is he will be productive on the job. If not, it is his motivation and not his skills and thus he has become a management problem. </p>
<p>I understand that the SAT is only .34 correlated to college graduation.  There are a lot of factors that make up why  youngsters drop out to college. Don&rsquo;t know if the study that arrived at the .34 correlation took these into the calculation. </p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen any studies but I would bet that SAT scores are highly predictive of success in cognitive skills such as engineering, medicine, chemistry, mathematics and the like. </p>
<p>As an aside, not long ago I read an article about Apple&rsquo;s recruiting process.  Even for &#8220;Peddlers&#8221; the process was ungodly rigorous. <br>

<p>A prior comment stated that 120 I.Q. is required for electricians. That seems a bit high to me; I personally know of successful electronic engineers and lawyers whose IQs are about that. Of course nowadays with the vicious anti-white male policies of American governments, there may well be young white men with genius level IQs (140+) going into these  trades. It will offer them their best opportunity to earn a living wage.</p>

Your suggestion is an insult to the many skilled tradesmen and craftsmen who have largely built this country.  Would you allow anyone with an IQ on the left side or middle of the black Bell Curve be the Master Electrician on your home or place of business.  No, of course not, unless you too have an IQ of room temperature.  Better buy some more smoke detectors.<br>
Just as important as true geniuses, we need strongly motivated support personnel, with much ingenuity. If there was any chance that blacks could do these things well in any numbers, there would be no Amren. </p>

		<p>Repeat, to all above. Alfred Binet developed the I.Q. test originally with the intent of identifying people of superior ability, who otherwise might not be recognized as such. This what I always heard decades ago. Then the story changed.</p>
<p>Whatever the original purpose was, the I.Q. concept was quickly put to work to identify slow and limited learners. As a means of  identifying persons of high intelligence, the I.Q. test measures level of aptitude, not preparation for any particular academic program or career. A high I.Q. level does not even tell you whether the possessor is stronger in mathematics or verbal reasoning even though that distinction is a powerful arbiter of what kind of education a person might be able to undertake and what career they could pursue. Other aptitude tests perform that function much better, but people with high I.Q&rsquo;s also are the high scorers on these as well. </p>
<p>As several people here have noted, a 100 I.Q. level with some strength in spatial and quantitative reasoning is a prerequisite for many skilled occupations.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I considered that society had developed to a point where a person with an I.Q. below 100 could no longer really function in it. Some people I told this to thought that I meant by this the idea that a person with an i.Q. below 100 could no longer get a job which provided them with enough income to live on.</p>
<p>While this may well be true, it was not what I really meant. What I had considered was that a person with an I.Q. of less than 100 might not be able to comprehend and manage daily life in our society, that a smarter person with a lower income (or no income) would manage whereas a slow or limited person would be constantly frustrated or confused particularly in the incessant interactions with technology people now experience.</p>

Europe always had apprentice and trade schools for mediocre and disruptive students to get some basic training in many manual jobs: landscaping, metalworking, welding, house painting, roofing, masonry, auto body work, cosmetology, haidressing, retail sales, cooking, etc.  Granted most blacks still would not have the discipline to graduate at anything, but at least their sabotage of other&rsquo;s education would be greatly reduced.

		<p>The United States will never be a truly free nation until the government stops forcing associations based on race. </p>
<p>Look, if a Black man wants to start a Black-owned business, hire only Blacks, and accept only Black patrons, he should be completely free to do so under the Constitution. Likewise for the other races/ethnicities/special interest groups. After all, choosing one&rsquo;s associations is a primary form of freedom of speech. Indeed, it goes to the very heart of free speech. </p>
<p>There is obviously a niche market for a business that advertises itself as White-owned, with only highly qualified and certified White employees that cater to the business needs of Whites. Many outstanding employees would feel safer working in an all-White environment, as would many customers. Such a company would be unencumbered by the oppressive affirmative action nonsense, etc. </p>
<p>For Blacks, they would not be encumbered by the White man&rsquo;s rules and regulations. If they want to smoke crack at work all day, come to work late (if at all), produce faulty products, and have sex in the break room, they could have at it! No racism would exist there to keep them down! </p>
<p>Hell, the Congressional Black Caucus, BET, Miss Black America, and the United Negro College Fund are already there, operating in full swing!</p>
<p>Feel free to disagree of course, but hopefully everyone agrees that it&rsquo;s not the government&rsquo;s place to force associations based on race, much less to prosecute those who actively segregate themselves and their businesses. In fact, such practices should be fully protected under the law. </p>
<p>Why? Because even though such a company would be completely peaceful, leftists would attempt to murder the owners, employees, and the firm&rsquo;s customers/clients. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as obvious as the day is long that America was a vastly better and superior nation when it was segregated and more than 90 percent White. Every metric in existence verifies that, and I&rsquo;m still waiting for one bleeding-heart leftist to produce one iota of evidence that proves otherwise. Anyone?</p>

		<p>I agree with those who post that blacks should have vocational training.  <br>
The intelligence of the blacks can only be unleashed with hard, military-like discipline.  Their inborn motivating drive, if channeled properly, can cause them to do well.  <br>
If this drive is not awakened or is channeled wrongly, the result is crime and laziness.<br>
As an example, one can look at black choirs in their churches.  They are often far superior to the choirs of white churches, because their standards of togetherness and quality of sound are much higher.  Using good  ethic as in some black churches, their energy can be channeled into high quality work.</p>
<p>Blacks are more picky about whites when it comes to the sound of the voice, and the exactness of rhythm.  Can this quality not be expanded to all work?<br>
Blacks are more picky than whites with regards to togetherness of ensemble, and giving ones all.  Just look at NFL teams.  </p>
<p>My point is, blacks have the ability to excel, the way to do it is just far outside the paradigm that whites use.  <br>
As regards to the lower IQ, this is true.  Much of the IQ test if full of trivial things,which are more fun to someone like an Asian, who does not mind performing trivial work.  </p>
<p>The black emphasis on &#8220;being real&#8221; could be channeled. IQ tests aren&rsquo;t real, concrete vocational occupations are.  </p>
<p>In addition,those smart black men must be allowed to have great power over their communities, to become chiefs.  They may become autocratic, and mete out harsh punishment, but only in this way can the black males drive be set to achievement.</p>

		<p>As an aside, not long ago I read an article about Apple&rsquo;s recruiting process. Even for &ldquo;Peddlers&rdquo; the process was ungodly rigorous. </p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s interview process:</p>
<p><i>Apply for a job and you&rsquo;ll face an oral grilling that probes for IQ. It is oral and informal because of Griggs v. Duke Power, the 1971 Supreme Court ruling that banished written IQ tests and &#8216;tests of an abstract nature&rsquo; from job applications. But Microsoft knows what it wants. It wants IQ. And Microsoft always has been savvy at getting what it wants.</i></p>

		<p>&#8221; Griggs v. Duke Power, the 1971 Supreme Court ruling that banished written IQ tests and &lsquo;tests of an abstract nature&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue with the black plaintiff Griggs was that although Duke power did not demand an IQ test, it did demand that every applicant had finished elementary school, 6th grade and could read work orders and manuals.</p>
<p>Griggs had not finished 6th grade and could not read work orders and manuals. So the supreme court ruled that people like him must be hired to fix power lines, gas leaks and other things.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A prior comment stated that 120 I.Q. is required for electricians. That seems a bit high to me&#8221;</p>
<p>The apprenticeship program is extemely competitive.  They take only those who score highest on a test of spatial skills, math and logic.  I don&rsquo;t know what the IQ level to get grades of B in algebra 2 and trig are, but it is somewhere around 120.</p>
<p>I know a lot of electricians who are my relatives.  I know their IQs that were tested in private schools.  120 to 134.</p>

		<p>&#8221; The white tradesman often has to &ldquo;pick up the slack for the non-performing &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; tradesman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel like the lone ranger, from dishwashers, to clerks, to school administrators to surgeons, Whites, hispanics and asians all take up the slack of work not done by affirmative action blacks.</p>

<p>As long as you are on your computer, why not google electricians licensing and apprenticeship exam prep?  Might change your mind about these dumb trades men and women.<br>

		<p>Dewey, Post 47:  You are absolutely correct.  Even with their low average IQ, and short time-frame, and anitsocial behaviors, Blacks can contribute to the economy and our civilization.  However, for that to happen, our society must accept diversity   &mdash;   i.e., that Blacks are different from Whites &amp; Asians.  </p>
<p>We need different educational and training programs for low IQ people and high IQ people. Trying to force everyone into the same educational program (e.g. closing the gap &amp; college-prep) is a disaster.  </p>
<p>Let Blacks be Black, and lets find a way for our society to provide them with honest work and a fair income.  A few exceptional Blacks will make it through law and medical school, but most will not.  So be it.</p>

		<p>Only a handful  &mdash;  if that many  &mdash;  public school districts in America<br>
have tried to implement a meld/ a complementary relationship/ between public schooling and homeschooling.  The Christian home schooler, Raymond Moore, tried this with some success.  The<br>
relationship, however, has to be held in place  &mdash;  there is little<br>
natural goodness of fit between the two. The abler Blacks in urban settings probably could do a lot to help carefully selected Black children by a primary emphasis upon homeschooling and a (largely Black) public school complement.  There is no constraint that home schooling has to be conducted in the particular home setting of the child&rsquo;s parent/s.  Any bright surrogate, emotionally suited and motivated, can do it.   The one-to-one help so lavishly available in homeschooling just is sparse, at best, in public schooling.  In the early grades, this sort of individual instructionj interface in reading, for example, can be a life-saver.  </p>
