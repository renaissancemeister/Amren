<h1>Video Shows Man Being Punched at Red Line Stop amid Laughs and Taunts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deanese Williams-Harris, Chicago Tribune, November 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police have launched an investigation after a man was caught on video knocking out an older man at the Chicago Avenue Red Line stop while others laughed and mimicked the attack.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The video, posted at worldstarhiphop.com, shows a man in a tan coat moving among people on the southbound subway platform as a group of youths joke and laugh. One of the youths starts following the man, turning around and smiling as his friends whoop and laugh.</p>
<p>The youth, dressed in a black vest jacket, then appears to tap the man to get his attention. When the man turns around, the two appear to exchange a few words before the youth suddenly strikes him on the side of the head.</p>
<p>The older man falls on his back so hard his hat flies off, according to the video. The youth and his friends board a waiting train as a woman kneels down and touches the man and makes a phone call.</p>
<p>As the train pulls out, one of the youths can be heard saying, &#8220;Who just did that?&#8221; Another responds, &#8220;He laid the (expletive) out,&#8221; and &#8220;He knocked his ass out.&#8221; One of the youths then mimicks the punch.</p>

		<p>All those Blacks just watch this happen, laughing and joking about it and it&rsquo;s a White girl who gets down there to check on the old man and presumably makes a call for help.  And yet, you could show this video to Whites by the millions and most would maintain that those people are just as virtuous as Whites. </p>

		<p>This is about as despicable as you can get. Picking on an older man, one who was just minding his own business, and then laughing and whooping about it afterwards. Of course, they&rsquo;re still all just &#8220;youths.&#8221; </p>
<p>Notice the article is careful not to say anything that might seem the least bit judgmental (as opposed to an article about, say, &#8220;vicious white supremacists&#8221; having a peaceful meeting).</p>

		<p>Violence, to an urban black, is a sport. Much as members of a baseball team might congratulate another for a homerun, the posse gives kudos to the hitter for a well placed knockout blow. The victim in this case seemed to be at least a little bit drunk or otherwise impaired, and so presented an easy target. Best for White folks to stand back, let them assault and murder each other, and be prepared to defend yourself if they target you. Carry concealed.</p>

		<p>Blacks are constantly revealed by their actions and words. First note the classic BLACK SUCKER PUNCH. Blacks have developed this into an art form. Note how all the blacks are laughing and joking about this cowardly and senseless act of violence. No one speaks out against it. As I have said a million times, black communities have no social capital and are a low-trust culture. This is the true reason why black countries and neighbourhoods are so backward and dysfunctional. Note how the attacker is smiling gleefully and seems oblivious to the fact that his crime has been recorded and he could face prosecution. Blacks, with their poor impulse controls, desire for immediate gratification and short time horizons just don&rsquo;t think ahead or consider the consequences of their actions. Finally note how the white person is the only one showing any humanity, checking on the victim and calling for help.</p>

		<p>Incidents like this are the perfect answer to all the &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; who claim black violence is some kind of rebellion against White oppression. This little drama perfectly illustrates that for blacks, violence is a primary way of dealing with others. </p>
<p>Sorry  if the above is a little cold, but that all I get out of it.  As for the victim himself, I don&rsquo;t care.  At this point I&rsquo;m past wasting sympathy on blacks.  For all we know, he was doing things like this himself when he was young, quite possibly to White victims. Yeah, I hope his tormentors are arrested but only so they&rsquo;re taken off the street before they can hurt any of our people!</p>

		<p>All of these youths appear to be well into their 20s, especially the attacker. It&rsquo;s also surprising that there are women in this gang, and it&rsquo;s incredibly stupid of them to take up with men who are obviously violent. However, as they seemed to be just as amused by the violence as the men, they shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised when they find themselves battered by them.</p>
<p>I also noticed the American flag on the victim&rsquo;s t-shirt. As many of the special groups are finding the flag offensive these days, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if that was what had set them off. If they find the national flag so offensive they should leave America, as this offense is normally felt by people who America would be much better off without. </p>

		<p>Unless you have been around black culture or hispanic culture (though preferable to blacks), don&rsquo;t call us &#8216;racists&rsquo; or bleed your heart for them.  I don&rsquo;t see any poor whites acting like this.  I don&rsquo;t see Asians or even Hispanics or Arabs acting like this.  This is a black thing for sure, and nobody can prove me wrong. I can&rsquo;t imagine any white person doing this to an elderly person.  We&rsquo;d beat the hell out of the white person if they did that, even if the old person they attacked was not white.  That&rsquo;s just cowardly and somebody with no shame. As an earlier poster said, I don&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s butt either what they do to each other as long as they leave us alone and they don&rsquo;t take any money from us or force themselves into white society, but I do feel sorry for the old black man.  </p>

		<p>#17 but I do feel sorry for the old black man</p>
<p>The problem with what you are saying is the intense hatred he has for us and the probable history of raping, robbing, killing, and assaulting whites.</p>
<p>Black people&hellip;..as a group, are evil.  That clip shows proof of what I am saying.  A random sample of blacks caught glorifying in an evil act.  If it was someone else being assaulted, would that &#8220;victim&#8221; join in?  Probably.</p>
<p>If you were there, would you take him home, and clean him up and take care of him?  What would be the likely result?</p>
<p>So our culture handles this by keeping such victims at arms length, segregating the blacks and maintaining a police state.  How many good white men die every year, policing these people.  Is this &#8220;victim&#8221; worth any of those lives?</p>
<p>The most important issue for whites is at the root of what I am trying to describe here.  Blacks are evil.  It is WRONG to have sympathy for evil.  The love of the black man is the root cause of almost all problems white people have.</p>
<p>How bad can it get?  Look at zimbabwe and south africa.  Love of blacks caused those white populations to literally sacrifice themselves (that&rsquo;s actually a distortion as it&rsquo;s almost always the case that such white people will sacrifice OTHER white people for their beloved blacks).  Even now that the cat&rsquo;s out of the bag and it is clear that genocide against whites is the agenda of those countries, there are far more than enough whites to put a stop to it.  So why don&rsquo;t they?  Because every white in those countries has their own blacks that they love and it would mean destroying them.  One by one, those blacks turn on their white &#8220;families&#8221; and murder them.  Even Eugène Terre&rsquo;Blanche, infamous for supposedly hating blacks and espousing white nationalism, met his end with his pants down around his ankles, sodomized and beaten by &#8220;his&#8221; blacks that worked for him.  The picture I saw with the story of his death said it all, with a large group of blacks in the background&hellip;..people who worked for him and whom he took care of.</p>
<p>Love of blacks is wrong.  And the punishment, routinely, is what Terre&rsquo;Blanche experienced.<br/>

		<p>In the lowest income white community a guy sucker-punching an old man would have been assaulted.</p>
<p>Not just by a stranger, but in all likelihood, from a member of his own group. We just don&rsquo;t behave this way.</p>
<p>This video sums up black values- they prattle on about their people, but it&rsquo;s a white girl who cares more for the old and infirm of their community. </p>
<p>Every single one of those blacks demonstrated a level of moral cowardice that is incomprehensible to a Westerner. I&rsquo;ve thought about this often, how manners and a manners system are a byproduct of an intelligent people and a precursor to the establishment of  civilization. For example Europeans or the Japanese. This situation fits well with my theory, blacks are not mannerly and the &#8220;civilizations&#8221; created in Africa are a reflection of this. Moreover, all the dysfunction blacks create in the West are a byproduct of their inability to behave in accordance with that host cultures manner systems.</p>

		<p>It isn&rsquo;t even just the fact that blacks are so violent (although they are). Its the sheer senselessness of the violence and the way they engage in it so casually, on a mere whim. This is what really perturbs me about them. It just isn&rsquo;t natural. It isn&rsquo;t behaviour you see in other groups of people. </p>

		<p>Listen closely, to the celebration among the hoodlums and you will hear the use of the politically incorrect &#8220;N&#8221; word. Not a problem for such persons to use the offensive word, but had it been uttered by someone else they would cry foul. </p>
