<h1>Hispanics Make up Nearly Half of All Texas Births in 2010, U.S. Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan Castillo, Statesman, November 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanic births accounted for nearly half of the state&rsquo;s 386,096 births in 2010, according to a federal report Thursday showing the birth rate in Texas exceeding all states but Alaska and Utah. {snip}</p>
<p>The figures offer more evidence of the impact of Hispanic growth in Texas, which led the nation in population growth over the past decade, increasing 20.6 percent  &mdash;  more than twice as fast as that of the nation as a whole. Texas grew by 4.3 million since 2000 to hit the 25.1 million mark in 2010. Hispanics accounted for two-thirds of that growth.</p>
<p>Migration from other states and other countries, as well as a high fertility rate among Hispanics, are driving Hispanic growth in Texas, said Lloyd Potter, state demographer and director of the Texas State Data Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Hispanic population in Texas is very young,&#8221; Potter said. &#8220;Just by the age factor, we have relatively few deaths, and consequently among Hispanics, there are significantly larger number of births than deaths.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2010, Texas saw 189,120 Hispanic births, accounting for 49 percent of the state total, according to the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released Thursday. Hispanics make up 37.6 percent of Texas&rsquo; population, according to the census.</p>
<p>Non-Hispanic whites had the next highest share of births in Texas, 134,906, or 35 percent. Non-Hispanic blacks had 44,559 births, or 11.5 percent of the state total, and Asians/Pacific Islanders had 16,818, or 4.3 percent.</p>

		<p>Texas is in the process of transition that California underwent a few decades ago. It will become another Democratic stronghold, bringing to an end any prospectives for the Republican Party to win any election in the future.</p>

		<p>Who knows? By 2036 Texas may go back to Mexico. America should have paid more attention to its southern border and less to Europe and Asia. Even today, brain-dead America keeps 28,000 troops on the intra-Korean border and none on its own southwest. America is also sticking its nose in territorial disputes between China and other Asian countries in the South China sea, while ignoring Mexican irredentist claims on its own southwest. The isolationists were right after all.</p>

		<p>Exactly why I&rsquo;m leaving. Lived in a very homogeneous area of Washington state before spending the last 3 years in Texas. I have been absolutely disgusted by the illegal mexican &#8220;culture&#8221; that I&rsquo;ve witnessed every. single. day. Headed back to that homogeneous community tomorrow, never to return. It&rsquo;s so sad, really, because I&rsquo;m a 7th generation Texan. It&rsquo;s just not worth it anymore.<br>

		<p>49% of Texas births in 2010 are to hispanics, 11.5% to blacks and 4.3% to Asians. </p>
<p>That means close to two thirds of Texas births last year were to &#8220;minorities&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I hope during the next debate, someone asks Perry how many of those jobs he brags about went to Americans and how many to illegal aliens? I am a Texan (by marriage) and a Republican (by choice), but not one person in those debates has convinced me that they would have the courage of Eisenhower and deport the illegal aliens from this country. It is horrifying to hear that we have become a &#8220;can&rsquo;t do&#8221; country. We can&rsquo;t deport 12 million illegals, we can&rsquo;t build a fence, we can&rsquo;t stop paying for their education, medications and incarceration, we can&rsquo;t arrest those who dance in the streets proclaiming their illegality, and we can&rsquo;t even call them illegal aliens for fear of offending them! My question is: What CAN we do?</p>

		<p>Political pendulums generally swing back and forth over time.  Having been a long time Texas resident, it has stayed an inordinate amount of time in the Republican Party sphere.  The massive increase in the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; population here insures that soon the Repub dominance in the state will come to an end.  And when the Democrats take control of this state, you can kiss not only Texas, but the rest of the country goodbye.  With control of the state going to Dems, they will re-write the Congressional District lines to gain as many House seats as possible.  In addition to this blatant power grab, you can more than likely kiss Texas&rsquo; Presidential electoral votes goodbye.  Combine California, New York, Florida, and Texas to the (D) column and it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how the rest of the nation votes.</p>
<p>And for you other Texas residents reading this, just know that the Dems have been out of power here for a long time.  When they get it back, they will NOT give it up again, even if it means massive voter fraud, packing state offices with political cronies, sidestepping legal procedures by judge-shopping issues through the courts, and giving away so many welfare freebies to the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; masses, who will in turn become loyal drone voters.  These leftist-statists are like termites, working 24/7 to destroy the somewhat stable situation we currently enjoy here over most of the rest of the nation.  Unfortunately, they will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>I fear for my state.  I see the beginning of the end and like Justine who is already leaving, I am planning my eventual escape to the Northwest initially and possibly overseas after that.</p>
<p>The continued importation of low-intelligence, low-skill, often criminally inclined 3rd-world people will displace the descendants of those who tamed and settled this land.  The end result of this social experiment by the elitist douchebags who foist this upon a dwindling productive middle class will not be pretty.  In 10-20 years, look for much of the Southwest region of the US to resemble Mexico in not only physical looks (run-down neighborhoods, etc.) but in political/economic/social  structure as well.  You will have a very small percentage of uber-rich elitists, a small slice (

		<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m naive, but wouldn&rsquo;t all these issues be remedied if whites simply  started having children at a younger age? After all, whites are still the majority today, and if somehow a change in the culture returned them to family builders, rather than career builders, perhaps we could save our race. I blame white men much more than white woman. Every time I see a pregnant white woman, I notice she is with a black guy, and usually has several mulatto children already. When I see a white couple, they rarely have any kids, and if they do,it us more often just 1. The issue is clearly with White men. We should all stop complaining, and win this war one orgasm at a time.</p>

		<p>Mexican Indians are becoming a majority in Texas and people worry about how that will affect the Republican Party. Who cares about the Republican Party? It&rsquo;s the future of the White race and Western civilization that&rsquo;s at stake here. What has the Republican Party done for Whites? As far as I can see it is part of the problem, if it perishes it was because of its own greed and stupidity. </p>

		<p>This demographic transition occured not only without the approval of the traditional American people, but against their will.  That makes it an invasion, and our government treasonous.  We have every right to expel the invaders by force and bring the government traitors to justice.  Of course that would take some spine, and most white men have lost theirs.</p>

<p>There has been virtually no black immigration since slave days except for some people from the Caribbean recently while there has been a lot of European, Latin American, and Asian immigration.<br>

<p>I cannot speak for Europe Mr. German, but here in the States, they tend to kill each other on a regular basis, which keeps their numbers in check. Also, a substantial majority of black men are in prison, which has acts as a positive deterrent on their ability to reproduce.</p>

		<p> That was the goal of the Democrats. To flood the country with illegal welfare types. They and liberal judges are making sure the counntry becomes another third world hellhole to make sure states like California, Illinois, New York, Texas, Florida, etc. become permanently Democratic. In the near future, Republicans, as we know of, will never win a nationwide election. White people are sitting quietly by. They only have themselves to blame. I will go so far as to say any White man or woman who votes Democratic is killing their own race off.</p>
