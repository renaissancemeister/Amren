<h1>Diversity Creates Challenge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Wichita Eagle, November 9, 2011  </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Like all Kansas school districts, USD 259 is trying to make test scores rise despite declines in state per-pupil funding. But Wichita must do so in ever-more languages, and with a fast-growing Hispanic enrollment. Any school reforms that emanate from Topeka had better account for this deepening diversity and its accompanying higher costs.</p>
<p>As an article by Suzanne Perez Tobias in Monday&rsquo;s Eagle revealed, the past decade saw huge demographic shifts in the district. The languages spoken by its students now number an astonishing 89, up from 66 a decade ago. The Hispanic enrollment has doubled since the 2000-01 school year to more than 31 percent this year, compared with 36 percent white, 18.5 percent black, 8 percent multiracial and 5 percent Asian. Nearly 8,200 students need English for Speakers of Other Languages services, up from 4,300 a decade ago. In just five years, there could be more Hispanics than whites in district schools.</p>
<p>The school board has to strive for equity and as much integration as possible as it draws new boundaries to account for the new schools within the 2008 bond issue, using magnet programs and other means to keep schools from being ethnically and culturally segregated. The promises to the community that attended the board&rsquo;s historic 2008 vote to end forced busing still apply.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Wichita district cannot rely on most members of the area legislative delegation to understand its challenging demographics and advocate for its unique interests in the legislative session. In fact, some lawmakers may want Kansas to follow the regrettable lead of Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who co-wrote the Alabama law that requires schools to check students&rsquo; immigration status and has set off a panic among immigrants. Kansas doesn&rsquo;t need such disruptive legislation.</p>
<p>Wichita&rsquo;s immigrant student population is here and growing. Serving it will be a challenge, but it also will enrich the community and its future workforce.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing the cognitive dissonance that goes on with these people.  If test scores continue to drop while Hispanics and blacks increase as a percentage of students, perhaps 2+2=4. Would a school that wanted to improve its football team welcome the arrival of nerdy, skinny types with no athletic ability?  So why do educators believe demographics with historically low IQs and poor knowledge of the native tongue will be able to compete with the white kids in the &#8216;burbs of Maize, Derby, and Goddard?</p>
<p>Furthermore, this op-ed overextends itself.  Kris Kobach, who has made NO reference to race when going after illegal immigration, is labeled &#8220;regrettable.&#8221;  Why should only the growing Hispanic population be worried about increased immigration enforcement?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t illegal Europeans also worry?  Is the editorial insinuating that Hispanics make up a large percentage of illegal aliens, and that those immigrants from Europe come here legitimately?  If so, then this is either a) unfair and racial stereotyping on the part of the Eagle if untrue or b) an accurate depiction that certain groups break certain laws much more frequently.  Either way, Hispanics aren&rsquo;t being discriminated against. </p>

		<p>&gt;<i>Serving it will be a challenge, but it also will enrich the community and its future workforce.</i><p>Ridiculous.  The only ones who will be &#8220;enriched&#8221; are so-called &#8220;diversity consultants,&#8221; lawyers with EEOC practices, left-wing and ethnic &#8220;community activist&#8221; hustlers, &#8220;refugee&#8221; organizations, and most of all, corporate and other employer scofflaws who get cheap, disposable labor while shifting the substantial and increasingly unbearable social costs of uncontrolled, unfocused immigration to the general public, who will not be &#8220;enriched&#8221; in any genuine sense but incontrovertibly impoverished as a result in multiple ways. Otherwise, the gabble about &#8220;enrichment&#8221; is a meaningless quasi-religious mantra, the equivalent of a recorded voice telling you to &#8220;have a nice day,&#8221; only less sincere and more cynical.</p></p>

		<p>Have they yet discovered that many of those hispanic speakers are indians from remote villages who don&rsquo;t speak spanish but their stone age indian language?</p>
<p>California schools are filled with kids who speak only indian languages. Translators must be provided.  They have a hard time with writing those languages on all those bi lingual forms.</p>
<p>Those indian languages are verbal only.  They never developed writing.</p>

<p>100 years ago an ambitious young man who could not get a job founded his own business.  Now an ambitious young person who can&rsquo;t get a job creates a cause and gets goverment funding.</p>
<p>I just got an idea for an Adam Sandler Will Ferrell type movie. </p>
<p>Guy graduates from college and can&rsquo;t get a job. He pretends to discover an endangered specie weed or worm.  His grandmother played by Holland Taylor  lends him a couple thousand.  He uses the money to hire a sleazy professional grant writer played by Danny deVito.</p>
<p>He becomes president of Save the Weed society, makes a fortune and gets the girl.</p>

<p>No doubt, this Marxist enrichment forecast means that all these categories of enrichers will learn to live in their racially diverse areas peacefully, occupy the same public space peacefully, attend the same schools peacefully, compete for the same jobs peacefully and demand racial and cultural privileges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, peacefully.</p>
<p>To believe the above, you&rsquo;d definitely have to be a brain dead adherent of the Cultural Marxism Frankfurt school of thought, would you not!<br>

<p>No one is demanding that African countries flood themselves with huge numbers of non-Africans.</p>
<p>No one is demanding that Asian countries flood themselves with huge numbers of non-Asians.</p>
<p>But EVERY White country and ONLY White countries are being flooded with non-Whites, and if you object you are a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews!</p>
<p>The pushers of diversity claim they are anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White.</p>

<p>Whites have a genetic defect cause a lack of melanoma. It also causes whites to all be racist to one degree or another. The cure for their wicked racism, it seems, is to surround them with more people of color. People who will no doubt suffer greivously from white racism. The response will be to send them even more persons of color. </p>

<p>Perhaps so since the legal definition of &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is required discrimination against white men while blaming them for discrimination, and then blaming white men for all &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; issues.  </p>
