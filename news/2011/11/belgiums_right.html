			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sevim Demirezen, Daily News, November 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Belgium&rsquo;s right-wing conservatives are campaigning to fund the return of Turkish migrants living in the city of Ghent to Turkey with the ironic slogan &#8220;Emirdağın sana ihtiyacı var&#8221; (Emirdağ needs you).</p>
<p>The Vlaams Belang party&rsquo;s campaign attempts to convince the Turks in Ghent, many of whom were from the city of Emirdağ in the Afyonkarahisar province of Turkey, to return to their hometown.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of Turks who are not happy here,&#8221; Johan Deckmyn, Vlaams Belang parliamentary member, told Hürriyet Daily News yesterday. &#8220;You cannot tell these people to return if you do not have an initiative for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said their campaign addressed Turks who could not adapt to Belgian culture and those who wanted to return to Turkey even though they had emigrated. Pointing to many failed government projects such as the attempt to send funds to African nations, Deckmyn said funds could be used for their project instead.</p>
<p>The Turkish community in Ghent called the project racist, but Deckmyn denied the claims: &#8220;I am not a racist. I am not anti-Turk. I just want to live in a country that is still my country.&#8221; The parliamentary member complained the Turkish population in Ghent was making the city &#8220;Turkish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some parts of Ghent are becoming Turkish. My native neighborhood is becoming Turkish. I don&rsquo;t recognize it anymore,&#8221; Deckmyn said about the change of shop names in the city. &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure Turks would not like to have Swedish quarters in Ankara.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign used Turkey&rsquo;s economic growth as a reason for Turks to return to Turkey. Deckmyn said the party was against Turkey&rsquo;s membership to the European Union although they welcomed economic relations between the two parties.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Germany i can certify you, bringing in the lower classes of the Middle East was such a good idea. Before we had this wondrous diversity our neighbourhoods were toxic and filled with tension, people rarely interacted with one another and if they did it was something negative, people stole from one another and cursed one another with their thoughts, words and actions. This cultural diversity was such an enrichment for our neighbourhoods, the lack of things we have in common has really helped to create stronger bonds in our community. People trust each other more, people are more charitable to one other, they organize cultural enrichment summer BBQs and are looking out for one another. There is a generally much more creative, loving spirit surrounding this area as opposed to the destructive, hateful spirit that we had pre-diversity. Those racists don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re missing out on. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Northrhein&#8221; seems to be living in another Düsseldorf that does not exist except in a drug induced state. Fact is that before diversity there was very little crime, drugs or no go zones. The mixing of cultures has had the effect of building ghettos and parallel societies that do not trust one another. Turks commonly refer to Germans as potatoes which reflects their loving sentiments toward their neighbors. Today the country including Düsseldorf are celebrating crime, fear, rapes and murder unknown before the coming of diversity. Düsseldorf is no longer a German city with almost 33% people form far off refusing to integrate and bringing down culture and a way of life that was able to attract these multitudes in the first place. &ldquo;Northrhein&rdquo; lives in a bubble and probably never knew how wonderful life was before the invasion by aliens of all sorts with little education and or skills other than living off the dole and waiting for a handout. Ask the Germans and the majority want fewer not more foreigners. &ldquo;Northrhein&rdquo; has an agenda which is unhealthy and reckless his comments are neither correct or truthful nor do they reflect reality in Germany.</p>

		<p>Anytime you have immigrants who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t adapt to the country of immigration, you have a problem.  In nations that have European-based populations, cultures, and political systems, there continue to be groups of people, such as blacks and Native Americans, who exist on the margins of society.  There are some people in these groups (usually with substantial white ancestry) who CAN adapt, and, if they&rsquo;re willing, they do.  If a country isn&rsquo;t willing or able to control these non-adaptive people on the margins, then the nation will increasingly become like the Indian territories of America&rsquo;s past.  <br>
When large numbers of Irish, Italians, Poles, and Jews entered the U.S., they encountered social problems similarly faced by non-Europeans groups.  But these white ethnicities were able to adapt and did.  Huge numbers of darker groups have not, to this day.<br>
Europe has many immigrants now, mostly Moslems of Pakistani and Middle-Eastern origin, who either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t adapt.  They also have a smaller number of black Africans, of various religions, with the same problem.  Many of these Moslems apparently have no intention of becoming British, French, etc., but behave as though they want to make Europe into a dhimmi state.  Liberal governments there cannot expect the common people to put up with this for very long.</p>

		<p>These &#8220;ethnic return projects&#8221; should come instead of foreign aid.When everybody has returned only then should we reconsider foreign aid,but only in a package that includes family planning. Everything could be done in a humane and orderly manner,no hate no bloodshed just reasonableness with mutual respect.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t get why my kinsmen continue to live in Europe, be in the Netherlands, Germany or wherever, although they detest it. This initiative is definitely a step in the right direction, ignore the bemoaning &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; insane lefties.</p>
<p>When you ask them, everybody wants to return home some day because they&rsquo;ve had enough of Europe, yet they still import their spouses from Turkey and have children. They don&rsquo;t want their children to behave and live like Europeans, at this point one might ask why not bringing up them home..</p>
<p>This is the biggest hypocrisy that I&rsquo;m (still) unable to understand. There is absolutely no reason for them to stay, even economically since the situation is quite good in Turkey. </p>
<p>But on the flip-side, Europeans are doing EXACTLY the same in Southern Turkey, in holiday destinations that I can&rsquo;t recognize anymore, as Mr Deckykmyn states, all shop names are in foreign languages. Retirees from all over Europe build their own ghettos in gated communities, don&rsquo;t learn the language, don&rsquo;t send their grandchildren to Turkish schools and demand 1st class services in their language. I&rsquo;ve ever seen FINNISH speaking doctors, shocking isn&rsquo;t it? Drunk European guys fight each other, pee on streets and insult elderly people. <br>
The only positive influence is, they do not live off Turkish taxpayers money and contribute to the economy through spending.</p>

		<p>For a moment there I thought the title was asking for Turks to RETURN to Belgium! Thank god that isn&rsquo;t the case. However I will say that I do have a respect for Vlaams Belang. Out of all the &#8216;nationalist&rsquo; parties in Europe, the VB still has its nationalistic overtones and hasn&rsquo;t done a complete u-turn into civic nationalism with which we are experiencing throughout the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>So, according to you, wanting to preserve one&rsquo;s homeland and that of one&rsquo;s forbearers for one&rsquo;s blood relatives and present and future progeny, is racist.  </p>
<p>Have you ever thought of asking a Turk if he/she would appreciate millions of White Europeans of Christian origin invading his/her Turkish homeland, not forgetting the demanding of preferential human rights privileges over and above those of indigenous Turks to add insult to injury?  Well!</p>
<p>Would you label him/her <i>racist</i> if he/she replied in the negative?  Well!</p>
<p>The term &#8216;Caucasian&rsquo; has nothing to do with it.  It fact, it&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s more often than not, inappropriately and incorrectly applied.  </p>
<p>White Europeans are not Turks and Turks who are non-White, are not White Europeans.</p>

<p>Well, conversely, from the point of view of those Middle Eastern invaders, I&rsquo;m sure millions of them would be more than delighted to admit what a walkover White former Christian countries are.  So much so that utter contempt is all that can be mustered for <b>all</b> stupid and spineless White former Christian Europeans for accepting this turn of events in the name of godless Marxist Liberal Political Correctness and most degrading of all, for abandoning their own religious roots.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>Do those Middle Eastern invaders have any respect for and tolerance of such decadent White trash?  </p>
<p>A resounding no!  </p>
<p>Do they desire to see White Europeans enslaved and slaughtered en masse with <i>their</i> Middle Eastern brethren inheriting White European territories as a result?  </p>
<p>Yes, big time! </p>

<p>Franklin it is one thing to throw around self perceived notions of IQ into a posting but it is completely unfair not to have elaborated further when assessing intelligence based upon a singular narrative. So in the spirit of giving credit where credit is due let&rsquo;s explore this a bit.<br>
Just where does posters 4,9 and 3 land on the standard Ryckaert IQ assessment?</p>

		<p>Ad (16) Sometimes questions about a comment on a comment work like a quick IQ test too!  But seriously, you can of course not assess someone&rsquo;s exact IQ score by such means.  The only thing is that you get an impression who is more and who is less intelligent.  That&rsquo;s all.  My remark itself was meant somewhat sarcastically.  But you need a certain level of IQ to understand that too!</p>

<p>Oh really? If your English is good enough, you should have seen that these people are not tourists but settlers. I don&rsquo;t care their age or origin. They are building ghettos right in my country and complaining about the non-European ghettos and behavior in their home country. Sheer hypocrisy, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Drunk, stupid,  &#8220;white trash&#8221; tourists is just another problem but one problem doesn&rsquo;t exclude the other.</p>
<p>As far as the Turks in Europe concerned, they should never have been allowed to settle there. But don&rsquo;t blame incomers, blame European politicians and industrialists who need voting blocs and cheap slave labor, respectively (yes, guest worker is a modern version of slavery, whether you like it or not). </p>
<p>Draw a parallel between the behavior of European and American capitalists whose profits are far more important than people. </p>

Thank you for responding with such a revealing position based on personal insight and matter of opinion. I&rsquo;m quite sure that the greatest minds of the past, present and future have and surely will follow the guidelines set upon us here at Amren by your brilliance of ascertainment.<br>
I can now allow assumption and presumptuousness to spearhead any revelation or conclusion I prefer to anything resembling a scientific approach and dodge questions in lieu of reason to get my point across.<br>
Thank you for the lesson, <br>
Happy Holidays.</p>

<p>Whilst satire was the intention, ie, as also evidenced by the reference to &#8216;lower classes&rsquo;, nonetheless, there is nothing wrong with picking up on salient or potentially ambiguous elements of a statement so as to establish the opposite prospective or side of the coin.</p>
<p>Nordrhein is probably a British native residing in Germany judging from his/her sense of humour.</p>
