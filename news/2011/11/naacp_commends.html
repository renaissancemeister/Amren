<h1>NAACP Commends State for Rejecting Confederate License Plate</h1>

					
					<p>Scott Lawrence, KFDM, November 14, 2011</p>					
					
									
                
                	
	                	<p>The NAACP today praised the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board&rsquo;s unanimous decision to reject a specialty license plate featuring the Confederate flag. The board voted 8-0 to reject the license plate design, with one member absent. The Texas NAACP State Conference has been outspoken against the license plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Confederate flag is a visual representation of a time and a place where racism was openly flaunted and people of color were terrorized for being different,&#8221; stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Jealous. &#8220;It is a stubbornly persistent symbol of hatred that does not belong in a government-sponsored public setting. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board made the right call today. Hopefully others in South Carolina and elsewhere will follow their example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased to see that the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board has made the decision to reject this symbol of racism, repression, violence and slavery,&#8221; stated Texas NAACP State Conference President Gary Bledsoe, who testified at the November 10 Department of Motor Vehicles hearing. {snip}</p>
<p>The license plate would have featured the logo of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which includes an image of the Confederate battle flag. {snip}</p>
