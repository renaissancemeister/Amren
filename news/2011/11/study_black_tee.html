<h1><a href="http://www.thegrio.com/health/black-teens-less-likely-to-use-drugs-than-whites.php">Study: Black Teens Less Likely to Use Drugs than Whites</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Onome Akpogheneta, The Grio, November 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study examining alcohol and drug use among teens has revealed that African-American adolescents are less likely abuse drugs than teens from other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Over 35 percent of white and over 32 percent of Hispanic teens admitted to alcohol use, while around 25 percent of African-American and 19 percent Asian-Americans and Pacific Island teens reported alcohol use. Drug use patterns were similar to those for alcohol use.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not think that African Americans had a significantly higher use and disorder rate, but the lower rate was a surprise,&#8221; said lead author Dan G. Blazer, of Duke University&rsquo;s Department of Psychiatry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The results show that overall 37 percent of teens said they had used alcohol or drugs in the past year. Researchers found that teens used marijuana more frequently than alcohol or other drugs, and analgesic opioids  &mdash;  like pain pills or heroin  &mdash;  replaced inhalants, or &#8220;huffing,&#8221; as the second most common drug after marijuana.</p>
<p>These findings surveyed 72,500 adolescents from all 50 states between 2005 and 2008, and asked about their use of alcohol and nine classes of drugs, including inhalants, marijuana, cocaine as well as non-medical use of prescription analgesic pain pills and sedatives.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Native American adolescents had the highest rates of substance use, with nearly 48 percent of teens reporting alcohol or drug use, and 15 percent considered to have a substance abuse disorder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After Native Americans, around 23 percent of children of mixed ethnicities and 20 percent of white teens admitted drug use, while African-American and Hispanic drug use rates were similar at around 18 percent. Asian teens had the lowest rates at just under 12 percent.</p>

		<p>Blacks lie. Asians also lie. The whole study is garbage. </p>
<p>Asians are paranoid about bringing shame on themselves while  drunk, but I don&rsquo;t know of any who don&rsquo;t drink at all. </p>
<p>Black youth are paranoid of &#8220;the Man&#8221; coming after them, and a host other absurd things. <br>
 <br>
I do suspect too that this study was intended to get similar results to previous ones that had similar results for White Americans. Partially, it helps certain interested parties (like the Mexican government) to blame the drug problem on whitey. </p>
<p>On alcohol, White Americans on average consume far less of it than most Europeans: a relic of some Protestant attitudes, plus Mormonism. Far less then many African countries also. </p>
<p>The statistic for African-Americans is extremely understated, and so is probably the Hispanic rate. The later is actually, I suspect, closer to the American Indian (&#8220;Native American&#8221;) rate.</p>

		<p>Blacks less likely to use drugs and alcohol than Whites?</p>
<p>Could it be that they&rsquo;re too busy raping, mugging, looting, shooting and damaging those very same White people, who - because they can&rsquo;t find any justice in our current so-called &#8220;justice system&#8221; and have a hard time finding a job due to outsourcing and Blacks taking all the city, state and federal jobs - just may have to drown their sorrows in alcohol and drugs?  Could that be the reason?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve seen these statistics before. They are based on questionnaires.</p>
<p>Questionnaires only determine how people answer questions. They do not indicate what they actually do.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of these results is that some groups (e.g., whites) are more honest than others.</p>
<p>Native Indians, however, appear to be relatively honest.<br>

I&rsquo;m always suspicious of these kinds of surveys.</p>
<p>Before you can accept the answers given you have to know how honest the people are in their responses.</p>
<p>Are blacks more likely to lie about using drugs? Are whites more likely to be honest? Are white kids more likely to lie as a way of bragging about being cool?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily dismiss the results. However, there&rsquo;s also the issue of &#8216;responsible&rsquo; drug use. Are white kinds more likely to use drugs in a manner that doesn&rsquo;t call attention to their use, impair their abilities, or disrupt their lives?</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. From what I recall in high school, white kids were far more likely to experiment with hard drugs than blacks. However, marijuana usage seemed to be about equal.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re forgetting an important consideration:</p>
<p>If the survey was presented to students at high schools, remember&hellip;half of blacks are drop outs, and weren&rsquo;t there to fill out the survey. And how exactly does a researcher from Duke University survey gang bangers, crack heads and inner city youth? Even if the survey was sent to/conducted at residences, how likely is it that these folks are going to fill them out?</p>
<p>My wife does research at a major university and she&rsquo;s ALWAYS complaining about her colleagues&rsquo; research methods. Just some things that may have been glossed over by the researchers. <br>

		<p>This is hardly news. Whites have been know to use drugs in much greater quantities than Blacks for quite some time. In fact, I remember a guest who was on the Tom Synder show, a program that use to come on in the 1990s on CNBC stating that if he ever was on trial for drugs or drug usage, he would want the jury to be made up of Whites between the ages of 18 and 35 years old. </p>
<p>He said this would be the group that would most likely vote for an acquittal and be the most leinent in any case regarding drugs.<br>
He also said that Blacks over 50 and White females over 60 would most likely be the most to convict drug users and dealers.</p>

<p>Toothpaste, soap and shampoo surveys are worthless.  Everybody says they brush 3 times a day, shower or bathe daily and wash their hands before meals and after using the toilet. But the amount of toothpaste and soap actually sold is much, much less than what would be sold if people were actually as clean as they claimed.</p>

		<p>Many blacks still believe seat belts are dangerous because if the car suddenly explodes they will not be able to escape.  </p>
<p>High school students who have been brainwashed for years probably thought the survey was connected with the tuskegee syphillis study, medical experiments on black prisoners or some other evil White plot. Evil Whitey wanted to use them for medical experiments.</p>
<p>Blacks believe many very strange things. </p>

<p>Mitch:</p>
<p>I beleive you. I remember a somewhat funny news story in the mid 1980s when a young White male local news reporter asked an elderly Black woman &#8220;did she have any hope&#8221; left in regards to an apartment complex that was being torn down in her neighborhood. She obviously misheard him and shouted &#8220;No! No! I Aint&rsquo; Got No Dope!&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
The reporter looked incredulous, explained himself, apologized to her and asked the question again. She understood him the second time around and gave a decent answer to the question.</p>
<p>It demonstrated to me that older Blacks have no use for drugs.  </p>

		<p>In my line of work, my findings are pretty much on par with this study.  From personal observations, marijuana use tends to be relatively equal but excstasy and other &#8220;club drugs&#8221; are overwhelmingly used by whites.  They may not be the ones selling but they are definitely the ones using.  I&rsquo;d also say that alcohol is used by whites in greater numbers.  At least this seems to be true in the nightclubs.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen in my 18 years on the job, those stumbling or being carried out of the clubs at closing time are usually white while blacks are sober for the most part.  Blacks just don&rsquo;t spend money on expensive drinks.  Between the relentless leftwing psychological conditioning our children are subjected to from academia, pop culture, and the media, plus the results of this study, perhaps these help explain why young whites of today are grossly lacking in common sense and so receptive to the anti-white, pro-minority propaganda being pounded into their skulls 24/7.  They truly are mind-numbed robots.</p>

		<p>They ASKED the little adolescent darlings if they drank or used drugs and just assumed they told them the truth? What idiots. And anyone who has had any dealings with blacks know lying is second nature to them. More than any other race I&rsquo;ve ever dealt with. They have some nerve calling this a &#8220;study&#8221;. Another false paper published to prop up and put a positive spin on all things concerning blacks. Even if they have to lie.</p>

<p>they used high school students, when half blacks don&rsquo;t go to high school.</p>
<p>If drug and alcohol abuse were in fact low among blacks, that would be a devastating finding:</p>
<p>for half a century, we&rsquo;ve been told that getting blacks to stop abusing drugs and alcohol would boost them in the direction of law-abiding prosperity.</p>

		<p><i>Illiteracy was probably a factor as well.</i></p>
<p>This is exactly what I thought.  </p>
<p>A black researcher once came into my classroom asking if he could run a survey about teen drug use and sexual habits in the teen &#8220;person of color&#8221; community.  He &#8220;methodology&#8221; was to pass out a lengthy, detailed questionnaire  to students who didn&rsquo;t have a prayer of decoding it the thing let alone understanding it.  No interviews, questions, nada, just the questionnaire.  I was allowed to read  the questions but not the answers   &mdash;   that that mattered little, I knew the students couldn&rsquo;t read it. </p>
<p>This was done in about 10 classrooms, I&rsquo;m sure the bogus research was  published in The Grio, Jet or Ebony as pure, disinterested, scientific analysis (as long as the results favored blacks and dis Whites).</p>
<p><i>Black teens less likely to abuse drugs than Whites.</i></p>
<p>If you were a White teen in modern day Amerika 2011:</p>
<p>How would YOU feel if you were told all day, every day in school that because you are White, you are responsible for ALL poverty, misery and pollution on the earth past, present and future?  YOU are pointed out as a slaver, racist and bigot who must pay penance forever to &#8220;people of color&#8221;  for &#8220;stealing their land, language and identities?&#8221;  You are forced to bow down, mau-mau and worship plastic gods such as mlk, cesar chavez and malcolm x?  Are called &#8220;You Anglo&#8221; or &#8220;White Boy&#8221; and told you have benefitted from &#8220;White Skin Privilege&#8221; and therefore have no right to an identity, let alone to exist?</p>
<p>How would you like to be told constantly, every day, by your teachers, textbooks and the media that It is because of YOUR White Supremecy that innocent, noble blacks and hispanics are violent, lazy and fail?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t YOU want to escape from THAT?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the drug stats make sense to me.</p>

		<p>These results are likely from the sampling of 8th, 10th, 12th grade and/or college freshmen. This introduces a selection bias as the drop out rate, and even absenteeism rates are quite a bit higher in the black, and hispanic portions of the population.</p>
<p><br>
Don&rsquo;t underestimate the dropout, and attendance effect. The Detroit public school system has a dropout rate close to 75%.  <br>

Why do you think white and American Indian teenagers are more honest than black and Hispanic teenagers? <br>
 <br>
This study, by Dan Blazer, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina was based on a survey of 72,561 teenagers. It is mentioned all over the internet as authoritative. I have not found a single rebuttal of the study. <br>
 <br>
The finding that black teenagers are less likely to use alcohol than white teens was also corroborated by a Gallup survey, dated November 5, 2002.<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
  <br>
In a world filled with temptations, high school teens are particularly vulnerable. But black teens may succumb to at least one temptation disproportionately less often than their white or Hispanic counterparts. Aggregated Gallup Youth Survey findings from 1999 to 2001* reveal that just 8% of black teens say they ever drink alcoholic beverages, as opposed to 25% of white teens and 19% of Hispanic teens.<br>

<p>Usually, because they were officially convicted of a drug possession rap.  In reality, the police probably nailed them for a lot of crimes, violent ones included.  But because black juries in black cities aren&rsquo;t in a mood to convict black defendants, and the victims of black violent crime are either too scared to testify, or too afraid of gang or other retribution, or hate the white justice system more than the black thugs who brutalized them, the District Attorneys are pretty much forced to plead the violent crimes down to &#8220;victimless&#8221; drug and weapons charges, with the suspect accepting the longest possible prison bid for those charges.</p>
<p>Mark me, pretty soon, there will be a story here on AR that whines about the harsh sentences that blacks get for &#8220;drug crimes.&#8221;  It usually has one about once a year.  Now you know why that is, and how to respond.</p>

At work I have known many Mexicans that love to drink and party and it shows.

<p>Well I am coming on here and I am White. While you are looking at these liquor stores. You are forgetting about the bars and taverns of this country. Of which 99% are White. The only places in the world with bars as we know them are White countries. If you have been a bar owner like I have you would know Blacks are the kiss of death to your business. As one poster noted above, Blacks leave bars SOBER. They order one of two Hennesseys or Remy&rsquo;s for the whole night. Whites, especially young ones drink shots of Tequila, Vodka, of many mixed type shots by the boatload. The only way one could survive in the bar business with Black customers is to have a  big cover charge for dancing. </p>
<p>As far as drugs I do not know as I have no experience selling them like I do liquor. As far as your comment about anyone can come on here and say their White you are right. Just as anyone can come on here and say they know what they are talking about!<br>

Possession of crack cocaine is punished more severely than power cocaine. Race profiling - which I endorse - means that young black men are more likely to be stopped and frisked than young white men.  </p>

<p>I think YOU are the one who doesn&rsquo;t know what you are talking about! I worked in a bar for 10 years!  Of COURSE, it was a White bar with a few Mexicans once in awhile coming in. I think I saw 2 blacks come in the whole time I worked there. Of course you are going to get mainly White patrons in a mostly White bar. Stands to reason does it not, that you see more Whites? </p>
<p>Ever hear of a flask? Blacks tend to use them a lot because they are too cheap to buy drinks in a bar. They also take their drugs of choice along with their liquor. There are many BLACK bars where I live so don&rsquo;t give me this about blacks leave bars sober! YOU don&rsquo;t work in a black bar so how would you know anything about it and what they do there?  I know a few Black women and they talk a lot about their favorite bars they go to. Think they don&rsquo;t drink? As for most bars and taverns being WHITE ones, I beg to differ. There are so many Mexican taverns here that you can&rsquo;t go a block without running into one. Many White bars have closed up and bought up by Mexicans and the like. Mexicans by far, drink and get drunk more than Whites ever have. 90% of auto accidents here are caused by some drunk Mexican, legal or illegal. Even when a White has one too many, they don&rsquo;t seem to get in auto accidents like the Mexicans do.</p>

What does that comment have to do with how much each group drinks? It says which group is more responsible. Well every one with a brain knows it is Whites. By the way you mention Black bars. If you go to Black areas the amount of bars per population is very very small compared to White areas. Also I have been to many African countries the amount of drinking does not even come close to Northern Europeans. It is true like you said many Blacks drink out of flacks etc. But how many Whites are getting blasted at home every night themselves. Also the rate of Alcoholism among White Gentiles in the U.S is 17.2.% The highest of any group. A quick look at my many White friends through the years confirms this. Even I must admit I drink a little more than I should. Furthermore Asians, Jews have rates below 2%. as I said before drinking is probably the biggest White vice. I also said so what, compared to our virtues it is not so bad.</p>
