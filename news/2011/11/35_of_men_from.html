			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), November 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study has found that 35 per cent of men from rural Brazil have had sex with an animal.</p>
<p>A total of 492 men took part in the study ranging in age from 18 to 80 years old.</p>
<p>A team of urologists from centres around Brazil were involved in the research project, which looked at risk factors for penile cancer in men.</p>
<p>And it found that men who had sex with animals during their lifetimes were twice as likely to develop cancer of the penis as others. </p>
<p>Those who had engaged in bestiality also reported a higher incidence of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Of the 492 men who took part in the study, 118 were penile cancer patients. </p>
<p>A total of 45 per cent of those suffering from cancer told how they had had sex with an animal.</p>
<p>This was compared to 32 per cent of healthy men.</p>
<p>A total of 59 per cent of men who had sex with animals did so for one to five years, while 21 per cent continued the behaviour, also known as zoophilia, for more than five years. </p>
<p>The subjects reported a variety of frequencies for their sex acts, ranging from monthly to daily. </p>
<p>The researchers found no association between penile cancer and the number of animals the men used over time.</p>
<p>The species included mares, cows, pigs and chickens, among other animals. </p>
<p>Lead author was Stjnio de Cassio Zequi, a urologist in Sao Paulo, and he said his study is the first to link the practice to male genital cancers. </p>
<p>He told LiveScience that if a man has sex with an animal it could produce micro-traumas in the human penile tissue.</p>
<p>&#8216;The genital mucus membranes of animals could have different characteristics from human genitalia, and the animals&rsquo; secretions are probably different from human fluids.</p>
<p>&#8216;Perhaps animal tissues are less soft than ours, and non-human secretions would be toxic for us.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This kind of behavior is routine in Africa.  There have been reported cases of it here in the US by Africans and African Americans.  Brazil has a significant population of blacks.  Asians, and all other peoples are smarter and less depraved than the African race.</p>

		<p>Bestiality is quite common in mandelatopia. Blacks especially have an affinity for goats, hence the term &#8220;goatf******s&#8221; that has been coined due to their sexual relations with these animals. Dogs and cats and chickens are also high up on their list.</p>

<p>There was a report in a paper in the UK last year about two South African &#8220;youths&#8221; who raped a female German Shepherd; no lie. The poor dog had to be put down due to the severity of her injuries. There is no abomination to which they will not stoop. In fact I have no doubt that some of the things going on against the Boers in SA and what is yet to come would give Heinrich Himmler pause.</p>

		<p>Is sex between men and mares how centaurs are born?  There are many centaur legends from ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Does this indicate that the ancient Greeks were also guilty of bestiality, as are the Brazilians of today?</p>
<p>Want some more horrible news?  As far as I know, the only effective treatment of penile cancer is to amputate the male organ.</p>
<p>Sex with animals?  No way would I do such sick depravity!  Not worth getting cancer of my you-know-what!</p>

Much of human &#8220;exceptionality&#8221; (as the late William Burroughs<br>
persistently reminded his admirers  ) is merely a matter of exposure and opportunity.  Adolescent male lusting is intensely<br>
(and normally)  impersonal.  Sex for males becomes personal and<br>
emotionally-laden upon consummation.  In rural America  &mdash;  notwithstanding our Protestant ethic  &mdash;  stump (fornicating) of cows<br>
was known of in about every rural village in the American Interior. The animals are inured to human contact and afford physical receptivity ( that taken on that dimension alone)  is better than any form of self-pleasuring and more nearly &#8220;human&#8221;<br>
than self-pleasuring.  Moreover, anyone milking a herd of cows,<br>
has a degree of personal involvement with each animal  &mdash;  each cow<br>
having the rudimentary habit complexes that impart animal personality.  The typical high school graduating class in<br>
the area I grew up in (West Texas) would have, say, 20 males.<br>
Of those afforded the opportunity and exposure  &mdash;  probably at least 25%, had stump (fornicated) a cow.  No competent physician serving such populations had any &#8220;code blue&#8221; reaction<br>
to any young male patient confessing to this sort of outlet.<br>
This news item is devoid of cultural or racial significance, <br>
frankly.   <br>

		<p>Re chimps:  their close relative the orangutan is known to be attracted to human women.  Read Biruta Galdikas&rsquo;s reports.  A male orangutan entered her camp from the woods and figured out how to rape a female Indonesian cook.  </p>
<p>I once read a tale of an Iraqi immigrant in the UK who was caught in flagrante with, I think, a sheep.  He couldn&rsquo;t understand that anything could possibly be bad about what he was doing.  This was on one of the humane-society websites.  Somewhere I also saw some discussion on whether sexual frustration (due to restricted female behavior) in young Muslim males was part of the impetus behind suicide bombings and intifada action.  The answer from someone who lived a good part of his life in the Middle East was no, as long as there are sheep, goats, and donkeys in those countries, no issues with that type of frustration.<br>

<p>Poetic justice.  </p>
<p>There is not surprisingly a link too between promiscuity and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Black men of course have the highest incidence rates of prostate cancer and rates of death:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/statistics/race.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/statistics/race.htm</a></p>
<p>As homosexuality likewise has borne out, promiscuity and unnatural sexual behaviors comes with a severe price:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd510.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.newswithviews.com/Devvy/kidd510.htm</a></p>
<p>A culture of death being visited upon elementary-school-children-and-beyond  doesn&rsquo;t deter the usual culprits/subversives who seek to overthrow straight America:</p>
<p>California lawmakers demand schools teach &#8216;gay&rsquo; history</p>
<p>Plan requires &#8216;particular emphasis on role in contemporary society&rsquo; </p>
<p>(The bill - NOW LAW was sponsored by state Sen. Mark Leno, who boasts on his website of founding a business with his &#8220;life partner, Douglas Jackson,&#8221; who later died of AIDS complications.)  Nice, eh?  Maybe your indoctrinated children can suffer the same fate.</p>

		<p>A white American woman I knew in the 70&rsquo; left her white professor husband for a big stupid Palestinian in Jordan. This was the late 60&rsquo;s. they worked at American military stations as cooks to make the money to get back to the US.</p>
<p>Her Arab Husband would molest the chicken before cooking it and serving it to the US military men. And she went on to marry him and have his child. Sorta tells you she had low standards.  Women like her are responsible for so many low class migrants coming to the US, because they bring their entire families after they get the green card.</p>
