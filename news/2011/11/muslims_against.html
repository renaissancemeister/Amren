<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/10/muslims-against-crusades-banned">Muslims Against Crusades to Be Banned from Midnight</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Travis, Guardian (London), November 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The home secretary, Theresa May, has ordered Muslims Against Crusades, an Islamist group which is planning to disrupt Friday&rsquo;s Armistice Day ceremonies, be banned from midnight.</p>
<p>The organisation, which burned two large poppies near the Royal Albert Hall in London on Remembrance Day during the minute&rsquo;s silence last year, is a renamed successor to the already banned Islam4UK and other proscribed organisations. Anjem Choudary is a leading figure in both groups.</p>
<p>The immediate ban is part of the government&rsquo;s new drive to proscribe organisations that glorify terrorism in addition to those having direct links to terrorist groups.</p>
<p>The ban will make membership of Muslims Against Crusades a criminal offence.</p>
<p>May said: &#8220;I am satisfied Muslims Against Crusades is simply another name for an organisation already proscribed under a number of names including Al Ghurabaa, The Saved Sect, Al-Muhajiroun and Islam4UK. The organisation was proscribed in 2006 for glorifying terrorism and we are clear it should not be able to continue these activities by simply changing its name.&#8221;</p>
<p>A parliamentary order was laid at Westminster on Thursday morning implementing the ban.</p>
<p>The group has often clashed with the English Defence League since it was set up last year. It has staged a pro-Bin Laden rally outside the US embassy. On the anniversary of 9/11 its members burned US flags and chanted through megaphones outside the embassy, disrupting a minute&rsquo;s silence by mourners at the nearby September 11 memorial garden.</p>
<p>A statement on the group&rsquo;s website said this year&rsquo;s Armistice Day would be marked by &#8220;a total lack of silence&#8221; by the Muslim community in Britain to highlight the continuing &#8220;atrocities&#8221; in Iraq and Afghanistan and the &#8220;brutal torture concentration camps of Guant√°namo Bay and Abu Ghraib&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hell for heroes&#8221; protest planned for Friday was also scheduled to take place outside the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p>Choudary of Muslims Against Crusades said the decision was a &#8220;bid by the government to cover up the truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said he did not know if a &#8220;hell for heroes&#8221; demonstration against Remembrance commemorations would now go ahead.</p>
<p>Responding to the ban, he said: &#8220;I think it is an abject failure of democracy and it is a victory for sharia Muslims. The truth is something the government would rather silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Home Office said the decision was based on an assessment of the group&rsquo;s involvement in the glorification of terrorism and the evidence that it was another name for an already proscribed terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>The ban, which has been evoked under the Terrorism Act 2000, also makes it a criminal offence to &#8220;arrange a meeting in support of a proscribed organisation, or to wear clothing, or to carry articles in public which arouse reasonable suspicion that an individual is a member or supporter of the proscribed organisation&#8221;.<br>

		<p>While I fully agree with this (although I would prefer they were removed altogether) I feel our freinds in the USA may like a bit of background. </p>
<p>The home secretary Theresa May is in serious trouble this week because the department of border control that she is ultimately in control of abandoned all Passport checks for a period of time. </p>
<p>She herself admits she has no idea how many criminals or terrorists arrived in the country or if they left.</p>
<p>This high profile act while welcome is just a bit of window dressing to get her in the good books again with the press and voters.</p>
<p>Ultimately this group will just carry on as usual with a different name. </p>

		<p>I have better idea, instead of banning these groups why not ban the participants and deport them?</p>

		<p>Whenever the Crusades are mentioned Christians are expected to be apologetic. The Crusades happened because Muslims would not allow Christians make pilgrimages to Christian holy sites.The Muslims had Mecca and Medina. Jerusalem is not mentioned in the Koran.  <br>
 <br>
The Crusades were marred by what Western countries have come to see as atrocities. That is the way war was fought back then. As invaders Christian Crusaders were not nearly as cruel to the Muslim peoples as were the Mongolians. </p>

		<p>They will simply reform under another name. The only solution is to revoke their citizenship and expel them. </p>

		<p>Before England can stand up to Islam, the Anglicans have to get back to Anglicanism.  I understand that most Anglican priests have never even seen a copy of THE HOMILIES, the basic statemnt of the Anglican faith, let alone studied it.  When Christianity gets back to its statements of faith, and put the &#8220;social gospel&#8221; on the back burner, Islam will crumble like the hodge-podge of Christian and Jewish beliefs that it is.</p>

<p>I am English, and very happy to be so. I do not believe that MAC should be banned; we are not afraid or upset by them for they are wonderful recruiters for English nationalist organisations and the Cameron regime know this. Visit the English Shieldwall on YouTube (as a start to learning about England and the English)</p>

		<p>JohnEngalman,</p>
<p>The Crusades were justified.  Muslim aggressors went into NON-Muslim lands and took over by force.  Christians whose lands were overrun by these violent creatures begged the pope to send help.  The crusaders went to help their Christian brothers and sisters.  The Muslim murderers got what they deserved.  Violence is the only thing these devil-worshippers understand.  Trying to reason with or appeasing these creatures only emboldens them.  Take a lesson from Ann Barnhardt, tell the brutal truth about islam and never back down from it.  <br>
Be prepared to fight back against islamic aggression!</p>
