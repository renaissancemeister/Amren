			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Smith, Politico, November 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The recall of Arizona State Senate President Russell Pearce, a Republican who crafted the state&rsquo;s immigration law, SB 1070, was one of the biggest headlines out of Election Day Tuesday night.</p>
<p>A post-election survey in Pearce&rsquo;s district found a major erosion among two groups who have typically supported the lawmaker: Mormon (or LDS) voters, and conservatives in general.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by Project New West with Myers Research, found that Pearce won LDS voters by a 16-point margin  &mdash;  which is &#8220;a lot of erosion&#8221; from his previous support in that group, said Andrew Myers of Myers Research.</p>
<p>The reasons for this departure were not immigration or a particular political issue, the survey found, but about character.</p>
<p>A full 42 percent of LDS voters said they based their decision on issues like a &#8220;personal shortcoming&#8221; of Pearce&rsquo;s or &#8220;his dishonesty or corruption,&#8221; said Jill Hanauer of Project New West.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And since LDS voters make up a full 34 percent of the district&rsquo;s electorate, Hanauer said, that&rsquo;s quite a population to lose ground with.</p>
<p>The survey found that conservatives in general, too, jumped ship from Pearce to Lewis.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the fact that three in 10 conservatives sided with Lewis, that&rsquo;s a pretty stunning number,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>UPDATE: One other interesting point from the poll:</p>
<blockquote>Immigration may not have been a motivating factor for most white voters, but Pearce is clearly not popular with Hispanics and that was a lynchpin to Pearce&rsquo;s defeat. Lewis and Russell split the white vote, but Hispanics  &mdash;  13% of voters  &mdash;  broke against Pearce by a better than 3-to-1 margin.</blockquote>

		<p>Pearce lost because of low voter turnout in a district where there were no other races on the ballot. Roughly 20,000 voted last Tuesday vs. 31,000 in the 2010 general election. The anti-Pearce voters were more motivated to vote in the special election &amp; the anti-Pearce coalition picked the right candidate, a &#8220;conservative&#8221; Mormon bishop but one who is opposed to immigration law enforcement. The election was essentially the same has having a Republican primary in which Democrats were allowed to vote _ the only other candidate, Olivia Cortez - Democrat, was hounded out of the race. It remains to be seen if Lewis will be able to win the actual Republican primary next year.</p>

		<p> The reason that he lost was the chamber of commerce wanting cheaper labor costs and supporting his opponent. I fear that we have more to fear from greed than hispanics. I&rsquo;m sick of being betrayed by the darn rich guys.</p>

		<p>While the anti-Pearce rabble did use local issues and this non-issue over the Fiesta Bowl against him, we all know that this was an organized hit on the part of the open borders lobby, but in the business world and in the religious (Mormon) arena.</p>
<p>The credible gossip is that Pearce will easily to be able to win his State Senate seat back next year, because he would be running against Lewis straight up and only involving registered Republican voters, or that since the Congressman in his district is retiring, he might run for Congress.</p>

		<p>I observe two things about this article.  Mormons deserted Pearce.  Mormons are full bore for illegal immigration for the same reason the Catholic church is&hellip;bodies in the pews and misplaced compassion.</p>
<p>Secondly, 1/3 of hispanics voted for Pearce or the other Republican.  I&rsquo;d bet that 2/3 of the voters were illegal immigrants or had an illegal immigrant family member living with them.  However, getting 25 percent of the hispanic vote for a white man who came out against illegal immigration is a huge achievement.  Pearce would have won if not deserted by his own church people, and by RINOs.</p>

		<p>Okay, Let me set the record straight about what has happened in Mesa, regarding the removal of Russell Pearce in Mesa Arizona. First of all I have lived here in the Valley of the Sun for forty two years. I moved here when I was one years old. I hail from Minnesota, and you will find lots of Midwesterners herein the Phoenix metro area. As everybody knows, Arizona has a become the main destination for Illegal aliens from Mexico, and other countries from the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
 What is going on here is what is essentially a civil war here in the Mormon community. Russell Pearce represents the old guard of Mormon conservatism. He also represents an Older area of Mesa. Anybody who has ever visited the Phoenix metro area knows that we have lots of space to continue growing, with the exception of Tempe, which is buffered, between Mesa and Tempe. Mesa has lots of space to continue developing homes and businesses, and other living accommodations. The area of old Mesa has many of the old town structures and the Main Mormon Temple is located there.  This area of Mesa has seen many huge shopping areas and strip malls, become overnight dilapidated areas. In addition, with the fall of the real estate prices in the Phoenix area, many of the older parts of the town of Mesa have seen a massive influx of Mexicans who have come here to work jobs in the community. When you put these two points together you see that some people are fleeing to other gated communities In Mesa.    <br>
On the other side of the civil war is the Mormons who are led essentially by Republican House member Jeff Flake.  Jeff Flake represents the new direction of some Mormon leaders.  Jeff Flake supports Illegal aliens and is in the pocket book (campaign contributions) of business owners. In a nutshell,  that is why one of his new lackeys won the recall election. This man is named Jerry Lewis. Basically Jerry Lewis was able to ride the sentiment of influential liberal bias in Arizona mainly the Arizona Republic, and local New Times papers. Most of these new Mormons also want to recruit Mexicans into the Mormon movement.  So basically these new school Mormons believe, gated communities and expensive living areas will turn the tide of the brown undertow.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a Scottsdale resident who appreciates Pearce and his contributions to AZ.  I contributed money to his effort but couldn&rsquo;t vote, not being in his district.<br>
Smith &amp; Politico are agents of sleeze to suggest &#8216;character&rsquo;, &#8216;personal dishonesty&rsquo; or &#8216;corruption&rsquo; cost him his Senate seat without any discussion or examples of these claimed shortcomings.  I followed Pearce&rsquo;s work and I&rsquo;m not familiar with any such personal failings. Why continue kicking a good mann when he is temporarily down???</p>

		<p>I live in Arizona and was saddened by Pierce&rsquo;s loss. He is one of the few who recognizes the cultural threat the massive Hispanic influx causes and had the guts to do something about it. Of course Arizonans elected Janet Napolitano and John McCain too. I can only say I think the voters here are clueless about what is best for the state and will continue to live in a lousy state enviornment because of it. Other that the usual cheap labor lobby I can only guess the voters here vote the way they do is because they are unpatriotic, uninformed and generally clueless. I&rsquo;d leave Arizona if I could but my present circumstances won&rsquo;t allow it. </p>

		<p>This is insanity.  Its over, the train is off the tracks and piled up in the field.  There is no more America, Americans or American Way.  The country is a just bunch of disparate cultures living and fighting for resources, power and control within the same geographical borders and political system.  Every-time a demographic segment is catered to in this and many other ways all it does is to invalidate the unique American identity and reinforce the segmentation of the others.              </p>

		<p>The Mormons have a particularly bizarre faith and internal customs, and are losing that all-American look, but they have an outstanding record for social service, patriotism and achievements. They are crazy religionists but exemplary citizens. This may seem paradoxical, but if other groups emulated their civic record, the USA would be a better place.  </p>

<p>Exactly right sir. Mexicans are scab labor, just like the East-Indians in the offices. </p>
<p>Not only do they take our work, they undercut the ability of working class Americans to make a decent living. </p>
