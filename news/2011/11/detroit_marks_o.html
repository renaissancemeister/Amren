<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Detroit school system is holding a celebration to mark the opening of a 161,000-square-foot addition to the Marcus Garvey Academy, an east side school with an African-centered curriculum for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.</p>
<p>The district says the opening ceremony for the $2.1 million Harambee Center will be Wednesday from 5-7 p.m.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She says the center will house student gatherings during the day and serve as a lunch room for middle school students. The school has about 585 students.</p>
<p>The project is financed through a $500 million voter-approved bond issue for the Detroit Public Schools.</p>

		<p>Hope they&rsquo;re teaching real African subjects in the school, like how to practice juju, how to tell if a witch is making your sex organ disappear, how to cook bush meat, home remedies for AIDS prevention and cure, how to get an aid package from foreign people/nations and international organizations..</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll turn them (I hope) into good African citizens, who&rsquo;ll be inspired to re-emigrate to their Motherland.</p>

		<p>Except for the fact that it is way too expensive, I am for this idea.  Black communities should have the freedom to explore and create a pedagogy that is based on Black values, Black history, Black culture, and taught by Black educators.  It won&rsquo;t fill in all the academic gaps, but some of the students will excel, and even more will feel good.   I also believe that Whites should have the same freedom to explore and create pedagogy based on our values. That we too should be able to teach European and American history, values, and culture, free from the multicultural dogma of political correctness.  Fair is fair.  Or at least it should be.<br>

		<p>I am for this practice as well.  I think all Africans living in America should attend such institutions of learning.  The more anti-White, pro-African, the better. It is a prelude to the greater awakening for Blacks in America to have a separatist African nation in North America. A nation in which all Blacks can emigrate to and live amongst themselves, separate from the evil White man.  The sooner, the better.</p>

		<p> Just as California has done and is continuing to do - the exact opposite of what they should do.<br>
 Their entire state is on the brink of total bankruptcy, largely due to illegals. Infrastructure is failing, their system was never designed to handle the growth of the population in the state. The Prison population is the only growth industry. The education system is in tatters, with good teachers leaving and state test scores falling through the floor.<br>
 So what does California do? They pass laws giving free tuition to illegal immigrants, cut back on immigration enforcement, refuse to secure the border.<br>
 I&rsquo;m just waiting to see which goes toes up first - California or Detroit.</p>

		<p>Wonderful. What will whites do? How about going back to the little red one room school?  An empty house (home) in the neighborhood bought cheap and transformed into a school.  It is not the fancy building that makes a good school, but the teaching and learning that goes on. Call it advanced home schooling. </p>

		<p>Detroit schools are 99.9% black.  </p>
<p>Funny story.  I was talking to a gay female couple today.  They lived in Detroit and are moving out because of the blacks.  Their language toward the blacks was very un-PC!  lol   </p>
<p>I have noticed that gays will move into the city and try to live among the blacks of Detroit because they are both &#8220;persecuted people&#8221; and are kindred spirits&hellip;I guess.   The only knowledge most of the gays have of blacks is watching re-runs of  The Cosby Show.  Once the gays get a real life dose of blacks, they can&rsquo;t stand them and move back out of Detroit.  </p>

		<p>This Afro-centric nonsense is hardly new either. This silliness has been around for ages and, not surprisingly, has produced no magical results in black academic performance whatever! So more taxpayer(ie. White people&rsquo;s)money is to be thrown away on a scheme - and particulary transparent and cynical one at that. </p>

		<p>Like #4 and #5, I am for the practice as well, much for the same reasons they outlined. What I am against, however, is the fact that $2.1M taxpayer dollars were spent on this.</p>
<p>Like the blurb under the story link on the main page says, Detroit - as a city - is facing bankruptcy within the next several months. Mayor Bing just held a press conference yesterday where he announced that by March of 2012, a thousand or more city-paid workers will be let go or laid off. As things stand, the city faces a budget deficit of around half a billion dollars for FY 2012.</p>
<p>It would be one thing if some wealthy benefactors and philanthropists came in and donated the money to build this monument to African culture, but to stick taxpaying Michigan residents with the bill - when, on top of it, we&rsquo;re just going to have to pay to bail Detroit out in a year or two - is insulting at best.</p>

		<p>The problem, of course, is that the &#8220;voters&#8221; in Detroit who approved of a $500 million (!) bond issue, are utterly penniless and fiscally incontinent. They have no chance of ever paying back a dime of the $500 million. Modern blacks believe in the juju of &#8220;education&#8221;, which they equate to shiny new buildings, desks, chairs, and above all athletic fixtures, such as basketball hoops, sneakers, and baggy, shiny, bright-colored, striped, athletic short pants. </p>
<p>The bankers float bond issues for Detroit blacks not because they expect the blacks to ever pay the money back, but because they expect white folks to eventually bail out the blacks and rescue them once again.</p>
<p>This is the bet that Jon Corzine recently made as the head of MF Global. He invested his fund heavily in Greek government debt not because he figured the Greeks would ever get off their butts and work off the debts, but because he figured Germany and France, as the bosses of Europe and the saviors of the Euro, would bail the Greeks out yet again.</p>
<p>Fiscal screwups like the welfare queens and government bureaucrats that infest Detroit should be denied the privilege to borrow money by floating government bonds they have no intention or capability of ever repaying. </p>
<p>If you live on Welfare or have a government job in a bankrupt polity, you shouldn&rsquo;t be permitted anywhere near a ballot box.</p>

		<p>The only workable solution to the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; is to let blacks have their own schools, the way they did under Jim Crow.  If blacks are allowed or even encouraged to do this themselves, then there will be little outcry from liberals about it.  If they want to claim the schools are Afrocentric  &mdash;  whatever they conceive that to be  &mdash;  then all the better as a way to sugarcoat the transition.  </p>

		<p>So what this means is segregation no more and no less. This might work provided they slow down the learning process for blacks and reduce the quantity of learning as well. So now we see why we had segregation way back then. </p>

		<p>Detroit is one of the wealthiest, safest, and best-run  cities in all of Africa.   Really!  Compare Detroit to any city in Zimbabwe, Nigeria, The Congo, Somalia, etc., or to any other city where Africans dominate, such as in Haiti or Brazil.</p>
<p>So, Africans should burst with pride because of what they&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish in Detroit.<br>

<p>I am a gay man who moved to the chocolate city of Durham, NC and very quickly lost any naive delusions that I may have had about black folks. The Duke Lacrosse scandal, the Eve Carson murder, working in an office full of AA black folks, and being verbally gay bashed by &#8220;yoots&#8221; really opened my eyes to race realism. I now embrace my Northern European identity unapologetically and have educated myself on statistics regarding race and its relationship to crime and IQ which has cost me several &#8220;friends&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Owen, I work in Durham often. There are many parts of which I refuse to make emergency calls to after dark. They are ALL centered around black neighborhoods. (No, I will not post my occupation, for my own odd reasons) The only good thing about the situation is, unlike many towns &amp; cities, at least in Durham, there is an obvious demarcation to be seen between the &#8216;good&rsquo; parts (white majority) of Durham ~vs~ the &#8216;other&rsquo; parts. Beware any city that &#8216;celebrates&rsquo; its &#8216;diversity&rsquo;&hellip;code language for mass section 8, smaller &#8216;pockets/cysts/sinkholes&rsquo; of&hellip;darkness, which means you dont know exactly which section to beware of. Fayetteville/Ft. Bragg, Jacksonville/Camp Lejeune are perfect examples of which I mean!&hellip;.Kid Clorox</p>

		<p>Ok, so they go to an Afro-centric school and things appear to be better for them; ie they perform well and they&rsquo;re not dropping out etc etc.  Then they graduate.  What will they be able to bring to the job market unless the entire Detroit job market requires an &#8220;Afro-centric&#8221; skill set.  Now Detroit will have another problem: that of people who were told that an Afro-centric education will give them what they need to succeed but, if fact, they will have even fewer skills (maybe) then they do now coming from a conventional education.  Anyway, If the Detroit public school system is 99% black, isn&rsquo;t is already &#8220;Afro-centric&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I applaud this opening of the school, but not of the financial failing of the districts.  </p>
<p>All true racial realists should applaud blacks finally opening their own style of school.<br>
The black male, with his strong motivating drive, demands strong discipline, honoring his ancestors (such as Marcus Garvey), and cohesivess of the community.  <br>
Pity for the black male, promulgated by the White liberal curriculum of &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; is like poison to the black male. </p>
<p>Only harsh encouragement, harsh discipline, and a strong community of involvement of the elders, like this school could well become, will unleash blacks success.</p>

<p>If only many, many, more whites had this man&rsquo;s reawakening at this time it might actually be possible to preserve what is left of this wonderful gem of a nation that we are soooo lucky to live in - The Good Old USA. Yes, a reawakening is happening, but much too slowly. By the time enough white Americans realize what needs to be done and how to go about it, we will be a pitiful racial minority. I can see the day when it will be a danger to be white in many areas - actually that day is here now. I haven&rsquo;t given up hope, but when I talk to friends, associates, anyone that I think has half a brain, I almost get depressed. There are still many people staunchly proclaiming their partisanship (You know - Democrat or Republican) and worried about their party&rsquo;s triumph and capability to lead us out of the wilderness. That&rsquo;s what is worrisome to me. They still don&rsquo;t get it! Both of these slimy political parties have put us into this destructive vice. And they are still arguing about the wrong things as well! So, what chance do whites have to wake up and realize the terrible predicament that their race, culture, identity, collective soul is in? None! Sorry to be so blunt, but I don&rsquo;t see it happening in time!</p>

		<p>Owen:  I used to live in Los Angeles. I saw many gay folks in my everyday life, but I did not live in West Hollywood. As you know, weho has all of the gay nightclubs and stores, etc.  The &#8220;gaybashings&#8221; usually consist of groups of black and hispanic men attacking lone white men who appeared slight or feminine. I remember when a white gay man was brutally attacked by a group of black men with baseball bats. it was outside of some weho nightclub. </p>
<p>The victim sustained permanent brain damage and could no longer work at his profession (voiceovers in the studios). When the perps were brought to justice, the marxist, minority dominated court would not even classify the attack as a hate crime. If the victim is white, even gay, it is not a serious crime, no questions asked. The perps never did any real prison time.  This is quite common.</p>
<p> In liberal Hollywood fiction, the gaybasher is always white, and the victim is always a minority. The evil white judge will then set the violent white criminal free. In the real world, the exact opposite happens. There is an episode on &#8220;Noah&rsquo;s Arc&#8221;, a gay black TV show, that portrays this fictional, liberal world of opposites. I wonder if that gay victim, a former employee of the anti-white media, is now an Amren member&hellip;reading our posts from his wheelchair. It&rsquo;s all very sad. </p>

		<p>&#8220;She says the center will house student gatherings during the day and serve as a lunch room for middle school students. The school has about 585 students.  The project is financed through a $500 million voter-approved bond issue for the Detroit Public Schools.&#8221;<br>
I make that US$855 thousand per afro-centric student. No doubt they will all make individual contributions to this bond issue once they have made their first couple of million through entrepreneurial enterprise and enthusiasm.</p>

		<p>If you haven&rsquo;t read this AR article by a white teacher in an AA majority school, please do so.  It really puts the Afro-centric brand into perspective.  Not a lot to lose to go that way but white teachers will need to step out of the picture &amp; funding will need to be private.  Fairness is a concept that has no currency when applied to White rights so refusing taxpayer subsidy will be a battle but all these battles are worth fighting because we are really defending The Law or what&rsquo;s left of it. </p>

&#8220;Except for the fact that it is way too expensive, I am for this idea. Black communities should have the freedom to explore and create a pedagogy that is based on Black values, Black history, Black culture, and taught by Black educators. It won&rsquo;t fill in all the academic gaps, but some of the students will excel, and even more will feel good. I also believe that Whites should have the same freedom to explore and create pedagogy based on our values. That we too should be able to teach European and American history, values, and culture, free from the multicultural dogma of political correctness. Fair is fair. Or at least it should be.<br>
Q.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q,<br>
Brilliant idea and the Mau Mau will love it but it should have one condition, that they find a way to fund it. If we get rid of the DOE then no one will be able to force any agenda on any of us. Back to the Euro American pedagogy and in two generations we&rsquo;ll be back to where we were before the evil LBJ came along.</p>

		<p>The Harambee segregation for thee and not for me scam again?</p>
<p>They have these wherever there are blacks. Philly has one, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, etc. They are always failures and basket cases.</p>
<p>Here is the scam charter school that defrauded the state of Wisconsin out of payments and grants and school vouchers.</p>

		<p>Seek #2: While blacks continue to gain their own &#8220;Schools&#8221;, or &#8220;Holding Cells&#8221;, White parents in the Detroit area, and elsewhere, still have some options open to them.</p>
<p>One such option is FreedomProject Education, which is an Online School which stresses a Classical Education. </p>
<p>Try finding anything that remotely comes close to this type of education anywhere in the Public School System. </p>

<p>Tax free munis.  They&rsquo;ll almost always sell like hotcakes.  DirtRot can always rely on the state of Michigan and maybe the Feds to pay their interest expenses if they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A Federal judge ruled that Harrisburg, Pennsylvania can&rsquo;t declare bankruptcy.  Jefferson County, Alabama just did.  If that judge&rsquo;s ruling holds, it&rsquo;s going to create some interesting precedents for all these financial sink holes known as black cities.  If they are ultimately allowed to go into bankruptcy, and Detroit does in the near future, contractual creditors, such as bond holders, get paid first.</p>
<p>The bond market knows that barring absolute armageddon, the purchasers of munis will get theirs.</p>

		<p>I have absolutely no problem with sending the Black children of Detroit to an African school. I grew up in Detroit and shared a classroom with many Black students and I can tell you from firsthand experience that an education curriculum designed for White children benefits very few Blacks of any age.</p>
<p>The Black children&rsquo;s abysmally low cognitive abilities prevent them from comprehending abstract concepts such as English usage and math, and their genetically induced lack of impulse control often creates insurmountable challenges to their teachers as they try to convey information to the children who have fully evolved brains.</p>
<p>How does it benefit our society and culture to burden those we entrust to educate our children with disruptive, ineducable descendants of cannibals. Why are we so hell bent on forcing unwilling participants to take up desk space that could be better   utilized by a children who aren&rsquo;t borderline retarded.</p>
<p>Let those children whose lineage began on the Dark Continent learn the ways of their true home.</p>
<p>If I were to design the coursework for such a school I would make sure that all of the major requirements of African life were covered in full. </p>
<p>I would create a shop class that would provide the students with hands on experience in building traditional shelter and weapons that would include hovel and spear labs.</p>
<p>Home Economics class would include cooking instruction for both vegetarian and apophagy diets. Specialized housekeeping studies would examine traditional cleaning methods for straw walls and dirt floors. An extra credit lab would allow the students to demonstrate how many different household and footwear uses they can find for discarded two-liter soda bottles.</p>
<p>Hygiene class would include comparisons of various dirt/urine compounds to determine which type serves best as a topical insect repellent. Other topics of study would include preparation for and  insertion of gigantic lip and ear lobe disks.</p>
<p>As heartbreaking as it will be for all of us AR readers to face, there may someday come a day when our dark little brothers and sisters feel that it is in their best interest to return to their ancestral homeland. We owe it to them to make sure they are prepared to make the most of the life for which they are genetically suited.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I haven&rsquo;t given up hope, but when I talk to friends, associates, anyone that I think has half a brain, I almost get depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Franko: I know how you feel. Whenever I post a race realist message on foxnews or other, I get maybe two or three thumbs up and some hate mail. My messages are not inflammatory. They are realistic and factual, however it seems like very few are listening. Keep trying though. Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day.</p>
<p>Also, I have a message for Foxnews: Fox, I have sent you three polite emails, asking you why you rarely report black on white crime.  I have asked you, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, as well. I have received no response.  Almost all interracial crime stories are blacked out on your station. I thought Fox was looking out for the &#8220;folks&#8221;.  It looks like you forgot us &#8220;folks&#8221;.  I used to be a moderate liberal, but after being ignored by you and the like, I&rsquo;m now on Amren.  I no longer care to hear about Justin Bieber, giant squids, and gay weddings. I want to be aware of anti-white crime and legislation, and i want to do something fight it. You are rendering yourself obesolete by ignoring our real concerns. </p>
