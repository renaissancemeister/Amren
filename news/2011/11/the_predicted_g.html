			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Judge, Daily Caller, November 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At 9:42 on Halloween night, I sent myself an email. It read: &#8220;Halloween shooting.&#8221; I had just walked a few blocks from Wisconsin and M Streets in the heart of Washington, D.C.&rsquo;s Georgetown neighborhood. I knew it was only a matter of time before someone got shot, most likely a black teenager. It was so obvious what was going to happen that I wanted to just email myself a note. There was simply no way, after what I had just seen, that someone was not going to get killed; I think I wanted to predict it just out of sheer frustration. We all know what the problem is. But we just don&rsquo;t have the guts to speak honestly about the issue of unsupervised black teenagers from broken homes and the havoc they can cause  &mdash;  to themselves and others.</p>
<p>Just before 11:00 p.m., 90 minutes after my email, a black teenager was shot on 28th and M Streets in Georgetown. He is in critical condition.</p>
<p>I had gone down to Georgetown to take some pictures and video of Halloween night, which in Georgetown, at least when I was a kid, meant costumes, crowds, bars and fun. Yet as soon as I got down there, I noticed something very disturbing. It is something we do not allow ourselves to talk about for fear of being called racist.</p>
<p>There were swarms of loud  &mdash;  and I mean cacophonously loud  &mdash;  teenagers drifting through downtown Georgetown. I was standing at Wisconsin and M Streets when a mass of about 50 of them poured across the street, ignoring the orders of a police officer who told them to stay behind the barriers set up for pedestrian safety. The kids were absolutely charged with energy; it was the kind of crackling atmosphere that happens before a fight. They spilled into the parking lot of the Riggs Bank. I followed them. On the other side of the parking lot was another group of black kids, mostly males. They were intently telling one of their friends to &#8220;not get involved.&#8221; &#8220;Those guys have guns!&#8221; one of them shouted. It was 8:30. On a Monday night. The PC police will have me over the spit, of course, but liberalism has cost so many lives that I don&rsquo;t care anymore. The fact is, there were not hordes of white teens and preteens roaming through Georgetown on Halloween.</p>
<p>Standing in the throng, the air seemed to gather weight. Well, here is where it&rsquo;s going to go down, I thought. There will be a shooting, which will be followed by calls from the liberal politicians in D.C. to &#8220;do something to stop the violence&#8221; and &#8220;give our kids some hope and opportunity.&#8221; There would be a story in the paper, and the comments section of that story would be filled with racist hate about a &#8220;chimp out&#8221; and &#8220;planet of the apes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all of that, no one would have the guts to tell the truth. It was not Asians or whites or Indians who were wilding in Georgetown. It was black teenagers. Illegitimacy and fatherlessness in black urban areas like Washington, D.C. has created an entire class of youth who have been weaned on gangster culture and have absolutely no impulse control. Being in the middle of the maelstrom in Georgetown, I was struck by a simple observation again and again: These kids have no impulse control. They scream to each other across the street at the top of their lungs, talk at the same time, say inappropriate things to adults and settle disputes with guns. Every single one of these problems is also a problem with white teenagers, especially considering the rising divorce rates among whites. But whites do not have such a terminal concentration of fatherlessness in such small areas the way blacks who live in inner-city neighborhoods like Washington&rsquo;s Anacostia do. We simply have to restore black males as responsible and loving authority figures and fathers in these areas or the same thing will happen every Halloween  &mdash;  and on most other days of the year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It was equally clear that the victims of these marauders were other blacks (although everyone was assaulted by the sheer volume of their voices). {snip}<br>
But the fact remains: The behavior that I saw on the part of many of the black teenagers in Georgetown last night was quantitatively and qualitatively different from the behavior of the other people there. And it does nothing but hurt the black underclass to not admit this. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} I did not capture any of the criminal activity; I foolishly wanted to just shoot some of the costumes and the fun. Maybe, like liberals, I was in denial.</p>

		<p>Well, Mark, this is your wake-up call:  Blacks ARE different from the rest of us.  Perhaps now you will cease to see blacks as &#8220;victims&#8221; of liberals and see them instead as victimizers of everyone.      </p>

		<p>You were not in denial and you had every right to be there and in safety.  Apparently what must be done is to forbid black teens and twentysomethings from being in Georgetown en masse.  That is not going to happen, so like you said, something has to be done about the root of the problem, which is fatherlessness, a violent culture, and their general financial status in life.</p>
<p>As much as we&rsquo;ve done, I cannot come up with any other ideas than to cut people off from welfare/public assistance/ et al.  Being unmarried is what keeps the welfare mothers taken care of, being a thug is what is popular because it denotes toughness and machismo, and being jobless is easy because you can just keep collecting and living off of the government dole.</p>
<p>While I dislike saying, &#8220;it&rsquo;s a culture&#8221;, it actually is.  An entirely new culture has been created in the United States by the people who thought endless public assistance is what blacks needed and continue to need.  These people are both the underclasses and the liberal politicians and civic leaders who perpetuate it.  One begets the other.</p>
<p>Honestly, as long as this attitude continues there will be no end to it and since simply pointing out the truth may label someone a bigot, racist, Uncle Tom, or Oreo, there are few who can or will do anything about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s not necessarily true that those on public assistance are going to create broken families, be violent, and be unwilling to work.  It just has to be limited to those who are actually in dire need such as with permanent physical disabilities or advanced age-created ailments, or as a TEMPORARY fix.  </p>
<p>It has to reach a point where enough people desire their own independence and that of others before things change.  Either that, or a full-on war must break out and we all will be forced to rise from the ashes, hopefully with this grand social experiment behind us and remembered as a lesson on what NOT to do.</p>

		<p>He wants to &#8220;restore&#8221; the black male as a &#8220;loving authority figure&#8221;? Well good luck with that project, pal! I myself am busy trying to turn lead into gold. I will keep you informed of my progress! Loving authority figure? Certainly the black male is interested in being &#8220;loving&#8221; and he is most certainly interested in being an &#8220;authority figure&#8221;, but, somehow I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what this poor dear boy means!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what amazes me about blacks - many are so mentally non-white that they act like a separate species.  The first thing I notice is the painfully loud volume at which they interact.  But, the real &#8220;kicker&#8221; is the raw emotionality and thoughtlessness, all action and no foresight.  IE: no impulse control.  They&rsquo;re dangerous toddlers.  <br>

		<p>&#8220;Every single one of these problems is also a problem with white teenagers, especially considering the rising divorce rates among whites. &#8220;</p>
<p>No matter how loudly they may scream, Whites can never be as loud as blacks.  White teens do not scream at the top of their lungs, do not talk over each other at the top of their lungs and almost never settle things with guns.  Hispanic teens sometomes settle things with guns, but do not scream and screech like blacks.</p>
<p>There is a 7-11 2 blocks from me.  It is a busy neighborhood of heavy traffic right up on the freeway.  With all the traffic noise, the TV on and windows close, I always know when 2 or more black men are in the 7-11 parking lot.</p>
<p>I can hear them 2 blocks away over all the traffic noise.</p>
<p>What an anti White racist this twirp is.  He is so reluctant to criticize black teens that he has to follow up by saying that White teens are just as bad.  </p>
<p>I guess it is a step in the right direction in that he mentioned race but he is just another despicable anti White racist.</p>

<p>We??We??  &#8220;We&#8221; the Whites of this country have given up entire sectors of the exonomy such as goverment, university scholarships, been driven 70 miles away from our jobs, been run out of every city, been run out of every city school system by the blacks and now &#8220;we&#8221; are to reform their unspeakable mating practices?</p>
<p>Does this idiot have any idea how black women would react if they were compelled to live with their baby daddies and kids? Black women hate black men.  They love being single moms with total control over the welfare money and alternative to welfare goverment salaries.<br>

		<p>Black fathers are no better than black mothers.  It would just mean more serious injuries and killings due to beatings because men are stronger than women.  The girls would be raped by their fathers as well as brothers, maternal grandfather if anyone knows who he is, maternal uncles and mamma&rsquo;s boyfriends.</p>
<p>Black men are terrible role models for their children.  The boiling rage and hatred in black women is often the result of rape by fathers.</p>
<p>Would 2 horrible, violent parents be better than just 1? The mothers just let the kids run wild after about 13.  When black men discipline their teens, one or the other is often killed or seriously injured.  I&rsquo;ve seen black domestic violence for 18  years as a police officer.  The kids are always safer if there is not a black male in residence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it makes a difference if it&rsquo;s the natural father, uncle, roommate or mama&rsquo;s boyfriend in residence.  They are all bad for the kids.</p>

		<p>It is not single Mothers.  It is black families that breed black teens, rich, poor, married, not married, urban, suburban, it is black families.</p>
<p>DC is the home of the wealthiest blacks in the country.  Every government office is the city and for 50 miles around is staffed with well off blacks.  Many of those kids were the children of the jumped up ghetto government worker blacks.</p>
<p>You can give a black a $90,000 per year GS 18 job, but you can&rsquo;t change black IQ and behavior.</p>

<p><i>We simply have to restore black males as responsible and loving authority figures and fathers in these areas&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Awhile back, I was listening to a local black talk radio host.  In his usual style, he was imploring black men to &#8220;get back to your children&#8221; and &#8220;marry your babymammas.&#8221;  One called him up, telling him he had 9 children by 8 women, and asked the host which of the 8 women he should marry, and why he should have to be a surrogate father to her other children by other men.</p>
<p>This Judge character is deluding himself.</p>

<p>I bet you actually had a mother, or at least a family (grandparents, perhaps) who raised you.  Black kids have no &#8220;family structure&#8221;.  They have relatives that share a &#8220;crib&#8221;.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t we get these kids together with their dads somehow?  Later when they&rsquo;re sent to prison, can&rsquo;t we send them to the same penitentiaries their dads are in, and let them share a cell?</p>
<p>To 12  &mdash;  Question Diversity: I never thought of those two important aspects, and I&rsquo;ll bet a lot of other people haven&rsquo;t either. Thanks for mentioning it. Yes, a young black man likes to play the field a bit, and see which babies come out the prettiest, before he settles down to just 3 or 4 women.</p>

		<p>One day these lib reporters are actually going to realize the truth. The behavior this reporter is describing IS NORMAL black behavior and can be found in every black area, city, and country.</p>
<p>The ideal loving normal black two parent home so fondly remembered was due to massive pressure from a dominant white culture. Once that pressure was removed in the sixties then the majority of blacks reverted back to the norm.</p>

		<p>Racist hate about &#8216;planet of the apes&rsquo;? </p>
<p>I always saw the film planet of the apes as a warning. Sure, at the end Charlton Heston says, &#8216;oh no, they blew it up&rsquo;. Humans had their nuclear war. But the image of the statue of liberty (welcoming all those foreigners) in the background when Charlton Heston realizes he&rsquo;s not on another planet ruled by apes but back on Earth. Seeing the statue of liberty is what makes him realize he&rsquo;s back on Earth. Who knows what the French author meant by the story. So, if &#8216;whites&rsquo; even try and warn themselves, this is racist hate? Regardless, seems like the warning or the racist-hate has rang true.  </p>

<p>The caller has a good point.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s impossible to say exactly how black fathers in the home would play out. I tend to bet on it would improve things, generally. But it&rsquo;s too late to hope for that, the black women will never be marriageable after 4 generations of being raised on pure modern liberalism. </p>

<p>Expecting blacks to behave like civilized people is delusional.</p>
<p>They must be treated like uncivilized people - not to make them civilized - but just to make them behave.</p>

		<p>Lack of impulse control and loudness are hallmark characteristics of blacks as any AmRener knows perfectly well. I was waiting at a movie theatre to buy tickets with my brother a few days ago. I suddenly heard very loud talking way down the end of the street. I estimate the distance at between 200-300 yards. I immediately KNEW it had to be blacks. NOBODY ELSE would make such obnoxious and offensively loud sounds. Sure enough three big young black males in their 20&rsquo;s(?) eventually strutted up to the ticket booth. Actually the writer of this story was lucky he himself didn&rsquo;t get hurt. The prudent thing to do would have been to have gotten out of there, pronto.</p>

		<p>People like this author seem to have either forgotten or simply do not know about the 60&rsquo;s, 70&rsquo;s, or even early 80&rsquo;s etc. This was, in many respects the heyday of urban Black malfeasance! And indeed, culturally, Blacks were still expected to behave, familially or in any other way, just like everyone else - that is to say, like White people. Nearly every Black family I knew of back in the 70&rsquo;s had a father in the home. I, like &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; did not, grew up with a single mom and had no issues. Hmmmm&hellip;</p>
<p>In the nearby New York City area, however, Black crime was out of control! Fatherlessness, etc. certainly don&rsquo;t help the matter I suppose - but is another Black male in any home realistically a sign that LESS violence and criminality is probable? </p>

		<p>The current impasse will continue until denial of racial differences in psychology has collapsed.</p>
<p>Then we can approach black pathology rationally.</p>
<p>Until then, it&rsquo;s all wasted effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, back in black Africa, before contact with Europe, did blacks live in stable, monogamous, nuclear families, did the men work all day and tuck their children into bed at night?</p>
<p>Their mouth fall open:</p>
<p>they know nothing about African society, history, or culture, then, now, or ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be a story in the paper, and the comments section of that story would be filled with racist hate about a &ldquo;chimp out&rdquo; and &ldquo;planet of the apes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all of that, no one would have the guts to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

		<p>You can blame it on racism. You can blame it on the Great Society. You can blame it on consumer capitalism. But the truth is that while these things may contribute to the problem, the root is the absence of good parenting in the black community.<br>
 <br>
- Mark Judge, Daily Caller, November 1, 2011<br>
            <br>
I would suggest that the &#8220;root&#8221; is the fact that the black race is closer in number of generations to a paleolithic existence. Farming and urban living exert different population pressures than hunting and gathering. People who live closely to each other need to live harmoniously. Over a period of many centuries the criminal justice system of a civilized nation removes those with criminal inclinations from the gene pool.<br>
 <br>
Agriculture began in the Near East ten thousand years ago. It began to spread to Europe about eight thousand years ago. Civilization began in the Near East five years ago. It began to spread to Europe about three and a half thousand years ago.<br>
 <br>
American blacks are descended from the Bantu. These began to use agriculture three thousand years ago. Large numbers of them only began to live in cities during the twentieth century. Urban areas where blacks live are not known for civilized behavior. </p>

I would be a little more circumspect about &#8220;welfare&#8221; children of my own race (White), but welfare should be denied to anyone who is able-bodied, and no voting rights should be allowed for anyone on welfare.</p>

		<p>I lived in the Washington, DC area when Georgetown became a magnet for hippies during the summer of 1967. For a number of years afterwards Georgetown remained crowded with hippies. Some of these were supported by affluent and indulgent parents. <br>
      <br>
More hippies were probably runaways, escaping abusive home situations. These later supported themselves by working in head shops, selling items on the street like copies of &#8220;The Washington Free Press,&#8221; taking odd jobs where they could find them, and sometimes by begging. They did not support themselves by mugging and armed robbery.<br>
 <br>
Although these hippies occasionally behaved in ways that offended those who were more straight lased, they were not violent. During my visits to Georgetown I never felt in danger. The hippies were nearly all white.  </p>

		<p><i>Every single one of these problems is also a problem with white teenagers</i></p>
<p>Had to throw that in, didn&rsquo;t you Mark. </p>
<p>I defy you to point out one White teen mob that specifically sought out and targeted blacks for vicious assaults as did blacks mobs this past summer.</p>
<p><i>It was equally clear that the victims of these marauders were other blacks</i> </p>
<p>Only because there were no Whites present to assault.  Whites would have been the FIRST target of violent black thugs as they were this past summer. No Whites around means they attack each other by default.</p>
<p><i>They [blacks] scream to each other across the street at the top of their lungs, talk at the same time, say inappropriate things to adults and settle disputes with guns&hellip; an entire class of youth have been weaned on gangster culture and have absolutely no impulse control.</i></p>
<p>These are inherent black behaviors, Mark, not caused by illegitimacy, but are a part of black DNA.  Those of us who have had to deal with blacks in our neighborhoods, workplaces and schools know this well.</p>
<p>Anyone who has spent time in a black-majority school (as I have) knows this is typical black behavior that goes on every single hour of every single day of every single year   &mdash;     the constant cacophony of shouting, yelling, screaming over each other inside classrooms and out   &mdash;     as Mark notes,  &#8220;everyone is assaulted by the sheer volume of their voices.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The behavior that I saw on the part of many of the black teenagers&hellip; last night was quantitatively and qualitatively different from the behavior of the other people there.</i></p>
<p>Maybe you need to come out of your safe enclave and visit a few black schools or a few neighborhoods where black Section 8 has been forced on White residents or a few businesses that were forced to hire unqualified blacks lest they risk a lawsuit.</p>
<p>This is what we Whites have been putting up with for 40 years with no end in sight   &mdash;   while the media call us haters, racists and Nazis.</p>

		<p>Political correctness allows us to deny or ignore the obvious, even when it is clearly to the determinant of society. </p>
<p>The unvarnished truth is the taxes paid to the government by the productive working men and women of America are being foolishly squandered in way too many areas.  Especially so, when it comes to the financial support given to single mothers.   In essence the government subsidizes single women having illegitimate children at the expense of taxpayers.  Many young, especially urban black, women actually choose this &#8220;welfare mom&#8221; lifestyle based on overly generous government financial support.  The harsh consequences, in a myriad of ways, to society are experienced daily.<br>

<p>You are correct.  Not only did I have a mother that made it clear that she would have merged her foot with my intestinal system if I ever thought about doing that sort of thing, she tried to get as many adult men role models in my life as possible.  As an aside, even though I&rsquo;m in my mid-30s and she&rsquo;s in her late 60s, I&rsquo;m still scared to think anything but pure thoughts when I&rsquo;m around her.  I still think she would actually try to put her foot up my&hellip;well, you know.</p>
<p>One other neo- and lamestram conservative canard of which I&rsquo;m getting tired, is this notion that blacks misbehave because they don&rsquo;t own their residential domiciles.  (That&rsquo;s part of what drove the subprime mortgage mania.)  I have never lived in an &#8220;owned&#8221; house in my life, and I&rsquo;ve never felt the need to commit a violent crime for it.</p>

They had their own business and neighbourhoods. A strong discipline and moral upbringing can effect how black people behave when they grow up.<br>

<p>Bon is so right.  </p>
<p>I live between  a big VA hospital and our neighborhood shopping street. Most of the VA employees are black except for the indian immigrant Drs.  All day long the blacks go back and forth to the business street for lunch, bank, post office.</p>
<p>I hear them screeching MF, N all day long, expecially from 11/30 to 2, their lunch time.  I have a big yard and the house is set way back from the street.  Yet I can hear them screeching at each other.  Thanks be to God, there is no black neighborhood near me, so they have to drive to work.  If they had to use the bus, their screeching at the bus stops would probably break glass.</p>
<p>Just 2 or 3 blacks can be heard 3 blocks away.  There is a mostly black clerical unit where I work.  They can be heard all over the 3 building complex and across the street.  As is normal with blacks, several MFs and Ns are in every garbled, incoherent incomplete sentence.</p>
<p>I work a 3pm to 11pm shift.  So does that black clerical unit.<br>
So I hear blacks screeching MF N at home during the day and at night at work.</p>
<p>I have been woken out of a sound sleep in the mornings because of<br>
VA hospital blacks screeching across the street.</p>
<p>It is black, not White single Mothers who produce most of the criminals.  60 years ago when most blacks were married, it was black 2 parent families who produced most of the criminals in this country.</p>

		<p>Good article. I am African and a resident of Brooklyn for almost 20 years and have worked with inner city kids.The kids are truly impulsive and irresponsible and seem to care about nothing. I have seen most of them grow up and they still see me as that father they did not have in their lives.They can be very good and lovely kids provided we-black parents, extended families and the community go back to parenting, stop whining of any kind and take personal responsibility for our actions, lives, etc. I do not comprehend a culture that advises kids to be gangsters, drop out of school and make babies and then call any black achiever &#8216;gay&rsquo; and &#8216;acting white&rsquo;. Additionally, we blame white people to eternity forgetting the jewel in our communities where Arabs, Chinese, Koreans and other ethnicities are prospering in our own with us as customers and consumers. It is time for black dads to hug and love their kids, walk them to school in the mornings, cook for them and be there round the clock making them responsible citizens. This will pay of in our old age. In Africa we say a cat can never &#8216;birth&rsquo; a dog and the kids will grow up to emulate what they learned at home. I blame the government too for being too generous with different types of benefits from EBT and free cash for kids to different types of payments for &#8216;disabilities&rsquo; that include drugs and other forms of addiction. It is high time we implement swift measures like curfews, dress codes, courtesies 101, and some of of corporal punishment at home and schools as a solution/panacea to these dysfunctions!</p>

Thanks for these very positive comments and I think I speak for most of the American Renaissance community when I wish you solid success with your time tested program of promoting good parenting. <br>
These problems we are having with Black urban teens are nothing new. The supposedly safe, wholesome White world of Ike&rsquo;s 1950s America have long been gone and we&rsquo;ve had unsupervised Black teens running wild, robbing, terrorizing and killing each other and our people since the mid 1960s - Black crime totals are down, but still high in places like Chicago, New York. The key is not to panic or run away - but you/we might have to move around a bit to stay just outside of harms way. We must always be looking for men like this Black African American man in Brooklyn and support positive efforts without bringing a lot of publicity that RACIST WHITE PEOPLE are trying to dictate policies to Blacks. <br>
Thanks again for your positive comment and God bless you and all those like you. The world isn&rsquo;t all bad and we&rsquo;ve been through worse.<br>

<p>African Lion; you more about this than I do so maybe you can answer my question.  What do the black mothers do to produce such children?  Are black men better parents than black Mothers?  White teens can be rebellious, but White children are very docile until 12 for girls, 14 for boys.</p>
<p>There are single Mothers of all races.  Most Whites, Asians, Hispanics and Middle Easterners raised by single Mothers turn out normal.  Hispanics have a high crime rate, but the kids are not impulsive and violent in elementary school.  But even 3 and 4 year old blacks are violent, aggressive and uncontrolled.</p>
<p>I have 4 siblings, we have 11 children and there are 7 grandchildren so far. We weren&rsquo;t disciplined or controlled very much by our parents.  We just let our children grow without much discipline. The grandchildren are still young but there is little conscious discipline or control.</p>
<p>I was a single Mother.  My kids took over most of the housework and cooking when they were 11 and 12.  The boy did laundry, vacuuming and floor polishing because he liked machines and noise.  They shared cooking.</p>
<p>I never told to take over the house, they just decided to do it after school. Maybe our family has a docility gene.</p>
<p>If you have any insight on this, I would love to hear about it.<br>

		<p>&#8220;DC is the home of the wealthiest blacks in the country. Every government office is the city and for 50 miles around is staffed with well off blacks. Many of those kids were the children of the jumped up ghetto government worker blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good point.  Hasn&rsquo;t large parts of Prince George County Maryland, a residential suburb for DC federal workers turned into a crime ridden ghetto since the government job blacks moved in?</p>
<p>I am always reading that the NAACP is once again suing the PG schools because so many blacks are suspended and expelled.</p>

We did not live around them and we have no clue as to what they did or didn&rsquo;t do. Maybe you watch too much TV and believe what has been repeated over and over again about how blacks were back then.</p>

		<p>I got a job as a probation officer in 1966.  Most of the criminals were 18 to 30.  By the late 20&rsquo;s they move on to state prison and state parole.  The county was only 8 percent black. The criminals were virtually all black.</p>
<p>They were born between 1936 and 1948.  They were all foul mouthed, loud thugs who had been that way since middle school.  Their parents were mostly married and stayed married.  Their fathers all had criminal records of soem sort.  Many of their fathers were in state prison serving long sentences for serious felonies including murder.</p>
<p>The black criminals of the 1960&rsquo;s had all been raised in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s by married couples.  I saw no difference between the black criminals of the 1960&rsquo;s raised by 2 parents and the black criminals of the 1990&rsquo;s raised by single mothers.</p>
<p>I doubt the return of black fathers in the home will produce anything better than the single parent families of today.</p>
<p>The one and only reason blacks behaved reasonably before 1960 and the civil rights movement is that police, schools and employers were able to control black behavior.</p>

<p>This is one of the best posts ever on Amren.  We have to undermine this ridiculous idea that if only blacks had their fathers in their homes, everything would be hunky dory.  Newsflash:  these missing dads aren&rsquo;t like Ward Cleaver   &mdash;   they are criminals and lowlifes.  If anything, the children would be better off without them.  That whole line of reasoning is a fig leaf conservatives use to stop short of acknowledging racial differences.  Our whole purpose is to have an open discussion of racial differences.  Crushing these sorts of cop outs should be our number one priory.  We need to drag the people who are closest to us into our camp and that means destroying the fraud that is modern colorblind conservatism.  </p>

<p>Blacks in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s were no more moral and disciplined than they are now. Genes are genes.  The only reason they were more civilized 70 years ago was that the merit civil service White police were able to keep them under control and out of White neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Then the Judges, the greatest enemies of Whites declared war on White police and Whites in general and sent their black stormtroopers to drive us from city to suburb to suburb to suburb<br>
all the while pursued by blacks and Judicial school busing and section 8 housing.</p>
<p>Hitler has his SA.  The comunists had their proletarian rioters.<br>

<p>The Judges created the legal structure and the governent pays the blacks to destroy us with school busing, out of control black on White crime, and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Lenin and Danton passed out money to their rent a mobs.  Hitler had the money to create a para military organization with the standard military benefits such as housing, food, medical care, uniforms and salary.</p>
<p>The goverment pays its black stormtroopers with affirmative action jobs, welfare, school busing, section 8 and encouragement and abetting of the black on White crime that has made our greatest cities black goverment dependent ghettoes.<br>
