<h1><a href="http://www.thegrio.com/news/lansing-is-the-interracial-love-capital-of-america.php">Is Lansing the Interracial Love Capital of America?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Scott Smith, The Grio, November 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In America in 2011, the idea of being &#8220;biracial&rsquo; has taken on a new meaning. The city that may be the best example of this new racial identity is Lansing, which has the highest percentage of blacks who identify with different races.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very common to see interracial couples here in Lansing,&#8221; said Beth Brokaw, a 28-year-old Lansing native. &#8220;Race was never an issue when it came to me, my friends, and dating. I knew a lot of people who were attracted to nothing but people from different races.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lansing, Michigan&rsquo;s capital city, is more of a cultural melting pot than most cities in the state. Just 55 percent of the city&rsquo;s 115,000 residents are white, the black population has risen 10 percent since 2000, and the Hispanic population  &mdash;  confined largely to the city&rsquo;s south side  &mdash;  has tripled in the last decade.</p>
<p>According to the 2010 Census, 4.1 percent of Lansing&rsquo;s black residents, or one out of every 25, identify themselves as being of mixed race. The next closest cities are Tacoma, Wash. and Killeen, Texas at 3.8 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You always see interracial couples here,&#8221; said Brokaw, who is white and has two biracial children. {snip}</p>
<p>Most blacks still see themselves as simply black, in spite of their varying cultural makeup and heritage. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of this is liberal baby boomers marrying outside their race or having kids with people of other races and liberal baby boomers being very vested in raising happy children,&#8221; Kristen Renn, an education professor at Michigan State University told the Lansing State Journal. &#8220;There is a youth movement around mixed race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lansing sits 90 miles to the northwest of Detroit and 60 miles east of Flint, two of the most racially segregated cities in the country. Interracial dating in Metro Detroit is still seen as taboo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was mostly in the suburbs  &mdash;  Novi, Farmington Hills, etc.  &mdash;  but you could tell that black folks stuck together in Detroit,&#8221; said Council, who used to work in the Detroit area. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve always said that I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable in Detroit because of my upbringing here. Plus, I&rsquo;m all for interracial dating and friendships.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I went to high school 25 miles from Lansing.  The unwritten story here is that Lansing is the running for the white trash capital of North America, hence all the interracial couples.  You can bet that most of those white girls dating blacks talk just like the blacks do and have values just like the blacks do.</p>

		<p>From talking to someone who lives in that part of Michigan, whose powers of observation and opinion I trust, the triangle of Lansing-Kalamazoo-Grand Rapids has to be the Bermuda Triangle of miscegenation in the United States.  His theory is that central to western Michigan, especially western Michigan, are big Dutch (Netherlands)-American regions, and he thinks that Dutch racial &#8220;sensibilities&#8221; somehow play into it.</p>

		<p>As someone who has lived in the inner-city I also have had the chance to observe many interracial couples. Nearly all of them being the black man/white woman variety. As far as I&rsquo;ve observed, this reality seems quite common in all urban areas. No where in this article is this discussed. My eyes may be fooling me, perhaps, for if they weren&rsquo;t fooling me surely the race experts, those who study race for a living, and all the tolerant and diverse institutions such as this paper, the Grio, would be telling us all about this disparity or perhaps telling us more details so as we could all be able to celebrate.  </p>

		<p>Looks like those that are all in favor, in this article, already are in black/white relationships and have mulatto kids. Big surprise. Not.</p>
<p>I detest these Whites who make it sound like this is the natural order of things. They do want to get exposure to their way of thinking so as to try to &#8220;influence&#8221; the rest of us that we are haters and ignorant if we do not approve. They love pushing their biracial agenda and especially to our young. I truly believe these kinds of Whites have some form of mental, moral defect in a major way. </p>

This woman needs to check the year on her calender. Most &#8220;baby boomers&#8221; are grandparents or close to it.  (Baby Boomers  &mdash;   The generation born between 1946 and 1964.) The YOUNGEST of the baby boomers were 25 in 1989. Their children are college age now.</p>

		<p>I just looked &#8220;Beth Brokaw&#8221; up on facebook. She looks like Miss Piggy and she has an ugly tattoo on her boob which she displays as her main facebook picture to the world. It&rsquo;s possible that she&rsquo;s &#8220;all natural&#8221; but to my eye it looks like she&rsquo;s had a boob job(too spherical)&hellip; and maybe collagen and botox.</p>

		<p>Someone should ask a liberal white woman what she wants for her children and grandchildren. </p>
<p>I would venture a guess that they don&rsquo;t want their offspring going totally black.  They have a vested interest in the creation of a world where mulattos are accepted in the mainstream, and future interracial unions with whites keep their descendants from disappearing entirely into black genetics.</p>
<p>Any normal being would want to have their genetics live on, not disappear through miscegenation. </p>
<p>I may be going a bit far in implying that liberal white women are &#8216;normal&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Wow, I&rsquo;ve actually said to myself many times the same thing about Lansing. Guess my eyes weren&rsquo;t deceiving me.</p>
<p>QD, you should really think twice about trusting your friend&rsquo;s alleged powers of observation. He couldn&rsquo;t be more off-base when it comes to the Dutch in West Michigan. They are very Christian, very conservative, and nothing like the modern Dutch of the Netherlands. Holland, Mich. was the center of Dutch culture in West Michigan. While it has been transformed by unrelenting Mexican immigration and now far too many blacks to make most comfortable, the result has been that the younger Dutch families move to very white Zeeland. Where they don&rsquo;t race mix. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d encourage QD and his friend to attend a Calvin College (Grand Rapids) vs. Hope College (Holland) basketball game, ranked one of the top rivalries in the country. The players are white and largely Dutch, the generations of fans are white and largely Dutch, and their communities are white and largely Dutch. This is the epicenter of Dutch, West Michigan culture, and it&rsquo;s laughable to call it some kind of utopia for miscegenation. </p>
<p>The lower-class whites in Grand Rapids in Kalamazoo, that&rsquo;s a different story. But very few of them are Dutch. Check your facts!</p>

		<p>When a White woman has a child by a Black man the child is Black.  There is simply no such thing a &#8220;bi-racial&#8221; person.  The only outcome is that the child is not a White person.  </p>
<p>The woman gave away her Whiteness.  Woman should be made aware of this fact.  </p>
<p>Almost all Black and White couplings are Black man / White woman.  The quality of the White women involved in these couplings is usually very poor.  </p>
<p>Rarely do you see an attractive White woman with a Black man.  But you do see it and it is very sad.  We are heartbroken.  We feel a loss and depression sets in.  We are White and feel a connection to the beautiful genes.  They are a part of us, and they are lost forever.  We feel as though a great painting has been slashed, a great cathedral demolished. </p>

		<p>Most inter-racial couples have a White woman paired with a Black man.  This is due to the vulnerability of the female of our race to the endless propaganda and conditioning that they receive from the major media.  The media has been promoting Black male/White female relationships since the movie &#8216;Guess Who&rsquo;s Coming to Dinner&rsquo; and even before.  White women are very susceptible to this &#8216;White guilt trip&rsquo; that we&rsquo;ve had hoisted upon us.  The people who are doing this know that if and when a time comes when there are no more White people, then no one will care.  Their goal is to get rid of White people.  Right now they are progressing very nicely with their plans.  If White people don&rsquo;t wake up, one day there won&rsquo;t be any White people, and if and when that day comes no one will care.  Our enemies will have won.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the progeny of these interracial trysts, have the benefit of a stable nuclear family? Or if, like here in the UK, they become one of a brood of low-achieving mixed-race kids with different fathers. The costs to us all - for these poor mothers, with their busy breeding schedule have no time to work and must be supported generously by the state (which means the saps like you and me who work and pay taxes) - have a catastrophic effect on the fabric of society. Budgets are finite. A couple of irresponsible amoral (dare one use such words these days?) work-shy slags with a couple of broods means a library must close. For, what is more important, keeping open a tranquil haven of learning available for us all, rich and poor, or encouraging - for that is what a subsidy, or &#8216;welfare benefit&rsquo; does - the fecundity of the feckless? The answer escapes me.   Black men do not have a reputation for taking the responsibility of fatherhood seriously. Their behaviour - inexplicably - mirrors that of their African counterparts. Why westernised black men should exhibit the same behavioural patterns as blacks in darkest Africa is a mystery. It must surely be a coincidence. </p>

		<p>Can anyone read this article and not see that the anti-White program of White Genocide is progressing smoothly?</p>
<p>A basic tenet of the Theory of Evolution is that separation is what creates diversity (distinct subspecies), and separation is what maintains diversity.</p>
<p>End the barriers to separation as is happening in Lansing, and formerly divergent subspecies converge to become one mixed population.</p>
<p>The anti-Whites&rsquo; formula for White Genocide is to remove all ideological and other barriers to mixing at the same time that they flood all white countries with non-Whites.</p>
<p>The people supporting this program of White Genocide call themselves anti-racists, but what they are is anti-White.</p>

<p>That photo gives me the shivers, truly. Despite features that should make a woman attractive, she looks as mad as she sounds. Her eyes creep me out.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s obviously a woman who orders White Genocide for breakfast, White Genocide for lunch, and White Genocide for supper, and snacks on spiders in between meals.</p>
<p>She would claim she&rsquo;s anti-racist, but what she is is anti-White. (Actually, from the looks and sound of her, she might openly avow the latter too)</p>

		<p>ATBOTL, You are correct in your assessment of Rust Belt states. Although Michigan has twice the black percentage of population as Ohio. But I live near Cleveland, and the West side was once all White, East side all black, except for a few Old World pockets of Eastern European Slavs and Hungarians in certain neighborhoods. There is a neighborhood on the near East side that is known as Slavic Village. This is featured in certain Hollywood documentaries in the foreclosure plight that has crippled America&rsquo;s economy over the last five years. </p>
<p>The old people die off, their White kids and grandkids high tailed it out of the city, and blacks moved in at break neck speed. I&rsquo;m sure the name will be changed to Swahili village in the near future.  To the West of Cleveland lies Elyria and Lorain, with extremely high rates of interracial couples in those towns. Each have about 50,000 people and high crime rates for cities their size. Following I-75 &amp; another 100 miles Northwest lies Detroit. So it seems that Lansing is the Elyria of Michigan. Note to liberals; miscegenation does not boost an already dying economy, despite the wishes of the cultural marxists. </p>

<p>I see the blame game on White women goes on. It is actually White men who race-mix equally, if not more than White women. In fact, several guys here on AR admitted to having an Asian wife or girlfriend, because they somehow couldn&rsquo;t find a &#8220;good&#8221; White woman. Imagine that, supposedly racially aware pro-White men without a White partner. It&rsquo;s hilarious and sad.</p>

<p>Yes, to all the above.  This could also be called &#8220;devolution,&#8221; with the practice of eugenics being perhaps the opposite, perhaps &#8220;provolution&#8221; type of artificial enhancement of the natural selection process, as a breeder of fine horses might employ.  </p>
<p>What is going on in West Michigan, and others locales such as Tacoma is due to cultural brainwashing.  Ask any of these whites why they are doing what they are and you will find that it goes deep into 19th century histories of Marxist influence.  Since many were German immigrants, Marx was read and thus had a huge influence even back then.  A socialist uprising in Wisconsin in about 1888 had to be put down by Federal troops.  So the mind set goes far enough back to have a vague yet strong influence on attitudes and practices that seem to actually work against their own best interests.  Not that it isn&rsquo;t continually stimulated and enforced by a media culture gone mad.</p>

		<p>I live in Killeen, TX (mentioned in the article as the third-most mixed city in America), and I&rsquo;d have to say that label is very accurate.  Interracial couplings are VERY common, and its not just black-on-white, there&rsquo;s also a lot of white-on-Asian, black-on-Asian, and of course Hispanics mixing with other races (though that usually doesn&rsquo;t strike me as miscegenation, since Hispanics are significantly white anyway, and the children usually look white).  Not only that, housing is EXTREMELY integrated here, probably due to Killeen&rsquo;s status as a military town where traditional ethnic-based neighborhoods have no chance to form.</p>
<p>Though the military presence can explain the situation here, i can&rsquo;t think of why miscegenation and racial mixing in general would be so common in Lansing.  I guess its just full of liberal baby-boomers, as the article says.</p>

In fact, several guys here on AR admitted to having an Asian wife or girlfriend, because they somehow couldn&rsquo;t find a &ldquo;good&rdquo; White woman. Imagine that, supposedly racially aware pro-White men without a White partner. It&rsquo;s hilarious and sad.</p>
<p>The misogynistic attitudes on these boards needs to change.<br>
  &mdash;  </p>
<p>Indeed I certainly know the trolls of what you speak of, yes we need to stop the white female bashing on here, as a white guy myself I ONLY find white women attractive. I think the pro white trolls that bash thier own women dont represent the majority of white men on Amren, most sane WM only find our white female counter parts attractive. <br>

		<p>Well the interracial love capital of the US seems to be Lansing, Michigan. From the comments I&rsquo;ve read here it seems that the majority of these interracial couplings are of the black male/white female variety. Consider Vancouver, BC Canada&rsquo;s interracial relationship capital. Not only do we have black male/white female couples but Chinese male/white female, East Indian/white female, Fijian/white female relationships. You name it we&rsquo;ve got it. Of course the genders of the relationships can be reversed or the same.</p>
<p>As an aside the promoters of interracial relationships are hard at work in the new TV series, <em>Terra Nova</em>. Not only is our protagonist family interracial (white dad, East Indian mom), but the newest family unit on the show   &mdash;   one that had a newborn   &mdash;   is interracial (again white dad, East Indian mom). Not only do the interracial relationship promotors want to pollute the genetic makeup of this era they want to pollute any future genetic variations as well. <em>Terra Nova</em> takes place in year 2149 in a &#8220;new&#8221; world to promote and foster the human race as the old world is uninhabitable.</p>

<p> They say they can&rsquo;t help who they fall in love (lust) with. Really? I wonder who put that foolish notion in their weakened brain.</p>
<p>ALL Whites (no exceptions) who engage in interracial relationships turn my stomach. They have just ended the bloodline that took thousands of years to keep intact. No more White children will be born to these people as they chose having a bi-racial child in the place of a White child. Shame on all of you. Thanks a lot, race traitors. There will one day be a &#8220;special&#8221; place for people such as you. You just killed off a White child being born.</p>

<p>I agree with your assessment of Killeen&rsquo;s inflated interracial percentages being due to the presence of Fort Hood.  My parents live in Lampasas, a mere 15-20 miles west of Copperas Cove and just a bit further from Killeen.  The presence of interracial unions declines noticably from one town to the next until they become virtually non-existent once you reach Lampasas.  The vast majority of those stationed at Fort Hood are not from Texas.  They are young adults miles away from their mom, dad, and extended family for the very first time.  After the relentless pro-diversity, anti-White male propaganda they were exposed to throughout grade school and in pop culture, this is most likely their first opportunity to experiment outside their race while being free from family scrutiny.  Unfortunately, many of them wind up with the unintended consequences of their youthful curiosity   &mdash;   black child(ren) and venereal diseases.   </p>

		<p>The attempt to integrate Blacks in to the mainstream of society has its price tag. Black&rsquo;s habitat wherever found whether in Africa or in their new found locations which now serve as &ldquo;home&rdquo; have one characteristic in common and that would be come to grief on a descending curve. Nothing is as sad as a Black neighborhood now just referred to as the &ldquo;Hood&rdquo;. Blacks have the ability to make things worse, destroy more than they build while taking civilization down to its bare minimum. Now that government has decided to integrate White and Black both are going downward to new lows. Television, Hollywood and academia have all contributed to making Blacks appear to assimilate although this in fact is only possible in the unreal world of make believe. White flight is the how people vote with their feet when forced to integrate but Big Brother is bent on blending the races thereby creating more Detroit type environments in city after overwhelmed city.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Part of this is liberal baby boomers marrying outside their race or having kids with people of other races and liberal baby boomers being very vested in raising happy children,&rdquo; Kristen Renn, an education professor at Michigan State University told the Lansing State Journal. &ldquo;There is a youth movement around mixed race.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>So those Mullet-headed Rust Belt people in the Acid Jeans and Reeboks, who watched Professional Wrestling and voluntarily listened to Kiss, Prince, and Michael Jackson were LIBERAL BABY BOOMERS?  Who knew?</p>
<p>You know, the last time I remember reading the term &#8220;Baby Boomers&#8221; was maybe two decades back, in an article by some hack journalist.  He was trumpeting the &#8216;RV Boom&rsquo;(Remember Winnebagos?), and saying it was due to &#8216;retiring Baby Boomers&rsquo;.  At the time, the people behind the wheels of those things were the PARENTS of Baby Boomers&hellip;the Greatest Generation.  But third-rate Journalists just loved that term, and stuck it in every article they could, whether or not &#8216;Baby Boomer&rsquo; actually had anything to do with anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this whole article reminds me of&hellip;except that the syntax and terminology here are far more clueless.  I remember when the term &#8216;biracial&rsquo; began to be applied to individuals.  It was being applied by the same sorts who were beginning to use &#8216;disrespect&rsquo; as a verb.  These were not the sort of people one considered to be educated, or even literate.</p>
<p>My understanding of the word &#8216;biracial&rsquo; is that it describes associations of racially disparate individuals (individuals each belonging to one of two distinct races).  A person might be of &#8216;biracial ancestry&rsquo;.  But that person would not be &#8216;biracial&rsquo;.  You could have a biracial team of explorers.  But you could not have a team of biracial explorers.  Am I wrong?  Or is Jerry Springer now an arbiter of Lexicography? </p>
<p>And American Civilian, you needn&rsquo;t have told me that it was NOT DUTCH people leading miscegenation in Michigan.  Beyond being fabulously beautiful (I speak of the men here.  Surely, the women are OK, too.), the Dutch are smart and sensible.  Everybody knows that.  Everybody knows that the Dutch, Danish, and Swedes won the Genetic Trifecta: Looks, Brains, and Kindness.  Even down here in Mississippi, however, we know that the industrial parts of Michigan attracted a lot of low-IQ whites from the scary parts of Europe.  We know that it is they who are doing the miscegenating.  It is they who left their children in minority-infested schools, to be destroyed mentally&hellip;making them vulnerable to interracial liaisons.</p>
<p>I wish, however, that you hadn&rsquo;t mentioned Zeeland, by name, as an extremely white place.  Mexicans, Somalis, and who-knows-what-else, are online, looking for white places to move to.  Government agencies, and big non-profit do-gooder concerns, are looking for white places to target for destruction.  Being publicly named as a &#8216;best place&rsquo; or a &#8216;white place&rsquo;, these days, brings trouble.</p>
<p>We will, however, be traveling to Zeeland, to see it before it disappears.  As young adults, DH and I discovered The Real America (When I was a girl, my ambitious parents took us on what few vacations they could afford to take, in Beverly Hills, Southampton, and Palm Beach&hellip; hoping to counter, for their children, the &#8216;Southern Loser&rsquo; mentality prevalent in Mississippi.).  How wonderful it was, for DH &amp; me, to discover Iowa and Minnesota!  European capitals, we found to be just smelly, inconvenient messes.  But Minneapolis!  And Des Moines!  Nirvana!  All those rationally-gridded places, set within even larger rational grids!  So different from the higgledy-piggledy disorganized Southern landscape.  So sad to see all those wonderful Midwestern places, full of wonderful Midwestern Blonds, being destroyed by non-whites.</p>
<p>Oh, and Harumphty Dumpty, I LOVED your comments regarding that woman and Spiders.</p>

		<p>How can we shut down race mixing in its tracks? First, if anyone in your family, or extended family engages in, or even favors this kind of act, they should be banished from your house, forever. </p>
<p>Once enough people have been put out of the homes that they once felt welcomed in, as kids and teenagers, that they have lost their parents&rsquo; acceptance, and have hurt their grandparents, and their Aunts and Uncles will have nothing to do with them, only then will they realize the cost of pursuing interracial dating and marriages. </p>

<p>This week I had a routine health check up.  Despite our area&rsquo;s demographics still being relatively low in people of color I saw an unusually large number of mixed-race couples and single women of color who were pregnant.  &#8220;How can any young couple afford to have a baby this days?&#8221; I thought.  </p>
<p>Of course I already know the answer.  I will help raise them with my limited income and taxes.</p>

<p>Key passage.  You can thank the educational system.  The indoctrination is pervasive, extending from the universities back down into the public primary and secondary schools.  I still think the solution to this predicament is the establishment of a de facto fully-accredited academy that is explicitly white-centric.</p>
<p>See the discussion from a few years ago on ARlist at Yahoo: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arlist/message/11192" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arlist/message/11192</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Finally!  This strategy is one of the extremely few (maybe the only one) that will effectively halt the cultural Marxist (and crypto-Communist Establishment educational system&rsquo;s) assault on White America in its tracks.  Even though it&rsquo;s all-male (the founder is an unreconstructed VMI alumnus), it&rsquo;s an excellent start.  Next, a small college open to both sexes should be established, that is blatantly oriented to white, European-descended students and the culture of White America.&#8221;</p>

		<p>#28: I understand your frustration with the mixing of Races, and the loss of future White children being born to these couples, but we also must look at what has killed millions of White babies since 1973, which is the Roe v. Wade decision.  </p>
<p>We must work to end abortion, through the Heartbeat legislation that has been proposed in several States. Remember, Abortion has been targeted to young, White women, who are constantly told that they must go to College and study &#8220;Women&rsquo;s Studies&#8221; and other mind numbing subjects, and then go out and get a job that offers them a &#8220;Career&#8221;, instead of a looking to find a husband and have a family. Babies are the Jailers of these young, career women, says the Marxists, and therefore, are disposable. </p>
<p>Think about how many White children have been terminated by abortion since 1973. </p>
<p>I advocate setting up a special fund to help young couples with a newborn, or a child on the way, or struggling White parents that have several children, and limited means for support, especially in these economic times. </p>
<p>This will ensure that the abortion does not occur, and that  White single women, or young White couples have the babies that support our demographics, while offering these children a stable home environment. </p>

<p>His theory is based on his observation of the Dutch in the Netherlands being devoted to &#8220;anti-racism,&#8221; and the fact that a lot of character actors on these &#8220;ripped from the headlines&#8221; prime time crime dramas and also cut &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; or &#8220;anti-hate&#8221; PSAs look Dutch and/or have Dutch surnames.</p>
<p>The problem with that theory, now that I think about it, is that The Netherlands is the white country in this world with the closest thing to having a white nationalist in power (Geert Wilders   &mdash;   Don&rsquo;t worry, peanut gallery, I know he&rsquo;s not perfect.)

		<p>#44 - I believe you are exactly right regarding women in our society today. They are taught early on they can have it &#8220;all,&#8221; including that wonderful six figure career along with two children and a house in the suburbs. Even the husband is optional today. They are taught to believe simply getting married and starting a family is beneath their abilities. I understand it takes two incomes to raise children. However, it does not take two six-figure incomes in my opinion. </p>
<p>By the time they finish college, graduate school and have climbed the corporate ladder to a position worthy of their talents; they are pushing 40 and decide it&rsquo;s now time to start a family. Often, their biological clock has other plans.</p>
<p>I have a family member who did all of the above. She has spent a small fortune on medical procedures in an effort to produce children. So far no luck.</p>
<p> At least she can be thankful for that great career and education!<br>

		<p>Reply to Mr. White at #50:  </p>
<p>I think there is a good deal of truth to what you say. It reminds me a lot of that doomed high I.Q. yuppie couple at the beginning of the movie IDIOCRACY. When I watched that movie I found it very funny, but it also left me quite disturbed. Its like that old saying, &#8216;the truest words are said only in jest&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Comment #2 by Question Diversity mentions that Dutch-American people may be a factor in the interracial marriage rate. A later comment denies any connection, citing the conservative nature of the Dutch in America. Having had considerable close contact with that group of people I think that there may be more truth in Question Diversity&rsquo;s comment than is apparent.</p>
<p>The Christian Reformed Church has taken a sharp turn to the left and now is softening toward many social questions on which they used to be very conservative. Many Dutch-Americans I know are keen on adopting children from Haiti, Africa, and Latin America lately. The Dutch in America are historically conservative in many ways, but that is changing. They are not immune to the maladies of the whole society. </p>
<p>Remember the mass murder by Rodney Dantzler in Grand Rapids this past year or so? It involved interracial marriage.</p>

		<p>#44 - Think about how many White children have been terminated by abortion since 1973. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why White girls abort their White babies because theres such a huge need for them from Whites unable to have kids. I&rsquo;ve known several White couples that wanted to adopt a White baby but were unable to ever find one. They said that the adoption agencies wanted tens of thousands for White babies - which they couldn&rsquo;t afford - and tried to pressure them to adopt a black baby instead, practically giving them away two for one.</p>
<p>So if any of you know of a White girl that is thinking of aborting a known WHITE baby, let them know that there are a lot of loving White couples out there that would be honored to raise that baby and it would save her the lifelong guilt of having aborted a baby. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll have to make a statement about Minneapolis. I lived there for three years (2004-2007), and was expecting my eyes to be assaulted with interracial couples. But I found that black male/white female couples were quite rare, and even interracial couples of any kind were not all that common. And that city is swamped with Diversity of every hue and stripe: Africans (both American blacks and those from Africa), Asians, and Hispanics. Most mixing involving whites were white men with a minority woman. And, in most mixing cases involving a white woman, the man was of non-black mixed race himself. I don&rsquo;t know where all these black male/white female couples are supposed to be, because I ain&rsquo;t seein&rsquo; &#8216;em.</p>
<p>Another fallacy is that of &#8220;those white women who mix with blacks are usually blonde&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t see that either. The last few such couples I saw back here usually involved a brown-eyed brunette, and the one blonde I saw with a black guy turned out to be hard-left and rather nutty, almost paranoid.</p>

In previous comments I have pointed that race mixing began with Columbus&rsquo; discovery of the New World. It has accelerated ever since. I consider the process to be irreversible.<br>
 <br>
Whether as explorers, conquerors, slave owners, or employers white men have taken the initiative with American Indian and black women. This has included white men who claimed to oppose miscegenation, like Strom Thurmond.<br>
 <br>
Oriental women have been difficult to possess. Nevertheless, many white men prefer them. This may be because they have less testosterone, as Professor J. Philippe Rushton pointed out in &#8220;RACE, EVOLUTION, AND BEHAVIOR.&#8221;<br>

When I first saw Oriental girls as a boy I thought, &#8220;With white girls some are pretty, and some are not. With Oriental girls all of them are pretty.&#8221; </p>

blacks have no respect for anything, unless it is raw power in the face.  Say a pistol or a shotgun.  they have little respect for themselves.  They know they are in over their head in a technological, thinking environment and they cover it up any way they can.  As for their women, black or white, you can have them all&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I remember reading a newspaper article back in the seventies that had a sad but all too common topic concerning bm/wf relationships. It was about this young white girl, age 18-20, who was from a small town in Pennsylvania. Her parents owned a small business where their daughter also worked. Like many young people she wanted to get away from small town America and thought she would enjoy life more in a large city, that there would be more to experience and more opportunities. Against her parents wishes, she moved to Boston where she got a job in a grocery store. A young black co-worker began to &#8220;sweet talk&#8221; her, and before too long, like many other foolish white girls, she was falling for the guy. As it turns out this black guy was a &#8220;pimp wannabe&#8221;and soon had this girl working the streets for him. Her lifestyle started to change. She was no longer that nice, down to earth girl her parents had once known, and they became alarmed. They soon realized that she was involved in prostitution and tried to get her to come back and live with them. Each time they brought her home, this black guy would call the house and want to talk with their daughter. The girl was so emotionally and psychologically brainwashed that she would return to Boston. This was breaking her mother&rsquo;s heart and so she convinced her daughter to return home for a visit, that she needed to talk with her. When the daughter returned to her hometown, it was for the last time, because her mother took her for a ride out in the country, told her she could not bear to watch her destroy her life, and ended up shooting her daughter dead. When this article was written there was not alot of the pc crap that prevent newspapers from mentioning race like there is now. In this article the races of those involved were revealed. It is unfortunate that so many white women fall into this same kind of trap with black men. </p>

		<p>As for White-Asian mixes, I am amused at how defensive some so-called &#8220;racially conscious&#8221; white men become when their own miscegenation is criticized. They will invariably blab on about how smart (read:&#8221;superior&#8221;) their children are compared with &#8220;other children.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a very heated confrontation with a white &#8220;Confederate&#8221; who had never lived in the South and who had a fish-head wife. When he boasted on and on about his &#8220;Southern&#8221; heritage, I reminded him that I was a native Southerner with a white Southern wife and that I knew my people and he was not one of them. Guess what he called me? A RACIST!<br>

<p>It is Blacks even before the Hispanics. Never fight a war either a virtual one or a real one with fire and lead on too many fronts. Take on the most dangerous enemy first. Whites and Asians are not going to marry in such great numbers as to eliminate either race but Blacks have been killing and assaulting Whites at a horrendous rate and Whites, in fear of leaving their children in a society ruled by these people are ceasing to reproduce. Asians also tend to limit their children to two.  </p>

<p>You are missing the point.</p>
<p>A race mixer is a race mixer, whether it be with an Oriental or a black, if you happen to be White. I am only concerned with my own race and could care less if nonwhite races mix. Don&rsquo;t kid yourself, there are plenty of mixed Asian/White offspring. The point is diluting the WHITE bloodline. Maybe you don&rsquo;t take it seriously, but I do. If we lose our race to ANY mixing then why do we even bother to post here? </p>
<p>I tire of some posters here who seem to be pro-Asian/White pairing and do not take it as a threat to White survival. IT IS A THREAT! Knowing that some posters here are already in an Asian/White relationship leaves me to believe that those who condone these relationships are only interested in their own selfish desire to convince the rest of us that it isn&rsquo;t so bad to our survival. You will never convince me of that flawed thinking.</p>

		<p>The best way to solve a problem is to learn as much about the problem as possible. The problem of white women going for black men, if it were scientifically studied, maybe we could figure out why it&rsquo;s happening and a way to prevent it. I&rsquo;m amazed there hasn&rsquo;t been a study done on it by now. What are we going to do just gripe about it until Hell freezes over? Just interviewing one or two hundred white women with black men might be enough to give us the answer and some ideas about how to prevent it.<br>
Also, Amren should promote the use of eugenic white sperm and egg banks. They are out there and sarogate mothers even nonwhite sarogate mothers implanted with white embryos, what ever it takes to get the white birth rate up.</p>

Thank you for those questions. <br>
 <br>
I read the posts and articles on American Renaissance and contribute my own comments because I enjoy investigating different points of view. I also contribute news stories which occasionally are posted here. <br>
 <br>
I agree with American Renaissance on three issues. I think third world immigration needs to be curtailed. I think books like &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; deserve to be defended and popularized. I think there should be a candid, public discussion of black social pathology, especially black crime.<br>
 <br>
When I use the word &#8220;Oriental,&#8221; I mean Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tibetan, and Mongolian. These represent a distinct race. The word &#8220;Asian&#8221; includes Caucasians like the Arabs and the Indians. <br>
 <br>
I am a Nordic Gentile. My ancestors came from Germany, and Germanic countries like England, and German speaking Switzerland.<br>
 <br>
I agree with other posters here that white Americans are threatened by third world immigration and crime, as well as by policies like affirmative action and busing. Nevertheless, I think the main threat comes from a white plutocracy that enriches itself by impoverishing America&rsquo;s once proud middle class.  </p>

		<p>I have to agree with an above poster who said that the trend toward inter-racial dating is irreversible.  If the founding fathers had any intentions of making this a totally White Christian country then that should have been incorporated into the Constitution. <br>
Why in HELL did they allow the importation of Africans?  Did they believe that someday all these slaves were going to evaporate into thin air? They evidently also participated  in a generous amount of  &#8220;schtooping&#8221; with the slaves; thereby producing mulattos.  They&rsquo;re all dead now and we are left to deal with the consequences of their avarice, stupidity, hypocrisy, lust and lack of foresight.</p>
<p> Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been less costly in so many ways simply to hire White people to pick the cotton and work the service jobs within the plantation houses? There was certainly no shortage of poor Whites in the ante-bellum South and in the North as well. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be an enthusiastic supporter of a &#8220;Back to Africa&#8221; program. Too bad that Marcus Garvey couldn&rsquo;t get some support from the US government. It&rsquo;s all too apparent that so many Blacks have no desire to participate in the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; and they will always be a our millstone and we will continue to support them and continue to be an accessible victim pool for their every growing criminal element. </p>
<p>The only solutions are a bloody civil war based on race, a geographical partitioning of the United States into separate countries or a step back to voluntary segregation with boundaries that will be defended; the latter being the most viable alternative.</p>

		<p>On Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore, miscegenation is fairly common among white females of low socio-economic status.  Desegregation of schools has increased familiarity of the races to the detriment of low status white females.  Dominance of two of our major sports by blacks has certainly encouraged miscegenation. Media promotion of equality of the races has something to do with increased miscegenation.  Absent fathers, who would be expected to prevent their daughters from engaging in romantic escapades with blacks, is probably another reason for the increase in miscegenation.  Divorce and illegitimacy has soared among lower status whites.</p>

American Renaissance does not have a party line. Many viewpoints are presented here. <br>
 <br>
If Mr. Taylor and I had a long conversation, we could find areas of disagreement. I would be bored living in a community where everyone was a Nordic Gentile like I am. <br>
 <br>
Because I live on the edge of a black ghetto, boredom is not my problem. The possibility of being mugged, robbed at gun point, shot, or murdered is, as is the threat of burglary. Right now I would appreciate fewer thrills, and some monotony. </p>

<p>No, I for one, will never be satisfied until we are permanently separated from other races in our OWN land. As long as blacks/browns etc. are IN our lands we will still have to PAY for all their costs in crime, courts, police, schooling, welfare, etc. etc. They will still be elected to Congress, as judges, in sports, TV/movies and the list will be endless. Total separation and eviction from our land is the ONLY solution.</p>

They will invariably blab on about how smart (read:&rdquo;superior&rdquo;) their children are compared with &ldquo;other children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a very heated confrontation with a white &ldquo;Confederate&rdquo; who had never lived in the South and who had a fish-head wife. When he boasted on and on about his &ldquo;Southern&rdquo; heritage, I reminded him that I was a native Southerner with a white Southern wife and that I knew my people and he was not one of them. Guess what he called me? A RACIST!<br>

<p>Great post!  I totally have to agree with you. A race mixer is a race mixer, even if it is a White/Asian coupling. They can NEVER produce a White child, ever. Of course we know there are posters here who are married to Asians and who ALWAYS defend that relationship and go on and on about how &#8220;smart&#8221; these Asians are. I never see them say how smart Whites are, do you?  </p>

<p>If Mr. Taylor and I had a long conversation, we could find areas of disagreement. I would be bored living in a community where everyone was a Nordic Gentile like I am.</p>
<p>Because I live on the edge of a black ghetto, boredom is not my problem. The possibility of being mugged, robbed at gun point, shot, or murdered is, as is the threat of burglary. Right now I would appreciate fewer thrills, and some monotony. <br>

<p>I would be bored living around YOU, John. As for you being a &#8220;Nordic Gentile&#8221;, I have grave doubts about that claim. Seems you want to drum that into our heads for some strange reason&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I am and have never been bored living around Whites like myself, since that is what I grew up around, many years ago. Those were the happiest, fun filled, days of my life. I thank God for those years. It has shown me the BIG difference from then and now. This country is now in darkness compared to the light that once was.</p>
<p>Whites come in all flavors and are as diversified as one race can ever be. THAT is the only diversity I want to see or live among.</p>

		<p>Throughout American history the most enthusiastic miscegenationists have been Southern white men with economic power over black women, either as slave owners, or employers. The vast majority of blacks in the United States have some white ancestry. This is obvious when one compares the appearance of most American blacks with African blacks. Where do you think those white genes came from? How do you think they got there?<br>

<p>Poster #57.</p>
<p>You are missing the point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m poster #57. You are confusing my misplaced HTML tags with my point. I did not say:</p>
<p><em>When I lived in the San Francisco Bay area I would often see white men with Oriental women. Those looking at the woman I was with and me would see that too. This was not because white men are more successful than Oriental men. It is because when white men achieve a measure of success they often choose Oriental women.</em></p>
<p>John Engleman was the author of those words, and I quoted him as a reference to questions I put to him, which he promptly answered (see post #67).</p>
<p>Anonymous #67, I&rsquo;m not a race mixer. I have never been a race mixer, and I do not plan on mixing with other races in the future. I do not find women of colour or women of different races attractive. I do not find ultra feminity in Asian/Oriental women. I find white women with blue or green eyes and with either blonde or red hair to be the most attractive. I am not a woman hater, nor am I a white woman basher like others on this blog.</p>
<p>I do, however, agree with John Engleman on one salient point. Engleman writes: &#8220;&hellip;I think the main threat comes from a white plutocracy that enriches itself by impoverishing America&rsquo;s once proud middle class.&#8221; I&rsquo;m not sure the greed of the controlling classes is the major reason for the wholesale destruction of the white race and its cultures, but it certainly is a contributing factor. We are all victims of the &#8220;great&#8221; social experiment known as multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is a failure in all English speaking, formerly white nations. I&rsquo;m proud to be a white, English speaking male that&rsquo;s racially aware. And in my own way, I fight the good fight every day.</p>

 <br>
If the American middle class had continued to share in the economic growth the country began to experience during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt I think there would be less concern about &#8220;race displacement,&#8221; or the even more hysterical term, &#8220;white genocide.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 the increasing productivity of the U.S. economy has not benefited most Americans, only the oligarchy.<br>
 <br>
For reasons of personal psychology many white men who are angry because of a declining standard of living prefer to direct their anger horizontally and downward rather than upward. <br>
 <br>
This does not mean that there is strength in diversity. Countries where the vast majority are still white or Oriental have fewer social problems than the United States, and are more resilient in the face of national traumas. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that in the United States the plutocracy thrives while the standard of most Americans dives. </p>

<p>Marrying? Really? Where are all these illegitimate future &#8220;youfs&#8221; coming from then?</p>
<p>I was in an ACE hardware store this weekend and an attractive young White woman was shopping and she was obviously pregnant and accompanied by one of her young White children. An employee asked her when she was due and if this was her second. She replied that the new baby would be number 4. The employee congratulated (ACE hardware people are very nice) her and she offered that she got a lot of disapproving looks from neighbors and passerby when she goes out with her three children. I really wanted to thank her for being a contributor to the survival of the Caucasian race. I never hear the liberals complain about the number of babies that Blacks pump out like rabbits.  All my former colleagues in education used to rant about the Duggars for having so many children. As far as I know they&rsquo;re not on welfare and they&rsquo;re all good looking and well reared children. I think that Michelle Duggar should consider stopping now for her own healths sake and for the sake of her existing kids but that&rsquo;s her decision to make.</p>

<p>I am guessing religion plays a strong part in this. I am assuming the Dutch in the Netherlands aren&rsquo;t as religious as the ones living in Grand Rapids and the surrounding areas of Michigan. </p>
<p>Years ago I remembered a high school classmate (of dutch descent) told me in private that the church he frequented did not approve of race-mixing. That&rsquo;s what he told me! I don&rsquo;t think the Dutch mixed with other whites even, although that may be changing now. Physically, I could spot a Dutch person from another white most of the time.

The role upper class Southern white men have played in having illegitimate mixed race children by black women they have had power over has been known for centuries. <br>
 <br>
How do I put down white men and women? On many occasions I have pointed out that everywhere in the world whites have higher average IQs than blacks, and lower crime rates. </p>

<p>Professor J. Philippe Rushton, of the University of Western Ontario has spoken at American Renaissance Conferences. This is what he has to say about racial difference between whites and Orientals:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Modern science shows a three-way pattern of race differences in both physical traits and behavior. On average, Orientals are slower to mature, less fertile, less sexually active, less aggressive, and have larger brains and higher IQ scores. Blacks are at the other pole. Whites fall in the middle, but closer to Orientals than to Blacks&hellip;<br>
 <br>
&#8220;For the past twenty years I have studied race differences in brain size, intelligence, sexuality, personality, growth rate, life span, crime, and family stability. On all of these traits, Orientals fall at one end of the spectrum, Blacks fall at the other end, and Whites fall in between.&#8221;<br>
<a href="/Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlesdarwinresearch.org/Race_Evolution_Behavior.pdf</a> <br>
 <br>
This is what Jared Taylor says about racial differences between whites and Asians regarding crime: &#8220;Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate.&#8221;<br>

<p>Upper class White men for centuries has had mixed race children for centuries now? You say it is a well known fact. Really? Which biased, lying &ldquo;history&rdquo; books that love to put down White men have you been reading? Just look at the lie about Thomas Jefferson that everyone believed now for decades. What was their agenda? They now say it was more likely his nephew or brother and not Thomas. <br>

Whether Sally Hemmings had illegitimate children by Thomas Jefferson, his nephew, or his brother, she had illegitimate children by upper class Southern white men. So did millions of other black women throughout American history. The great majority of these relationships were not consensual. That is why most American blacks have some white ancestry. They did not get it from white women raped by black men. They did not get it from white liberals. </p>

<p>BTW, what is YOUR agenda coming on this site?<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
I am here because I enjoy investigating different points of view, because I agree with American Renaissance on important issues, and because I like to debate politics. <br>
 <br>
Agreements I have expressed on this website, using my name, with Jared Taylor, Professor J. Philippe Rushton, Charles Murray, and others could get me in trouble with liberal employers and bosses. </p>
