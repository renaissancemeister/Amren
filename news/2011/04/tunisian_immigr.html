<h1><a href="https://www.euronews.net/2011/04/03/tunisian-immigrants-protest-against-france/">Tunisian Immigrants Protest Against France</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Euronews, April 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Around one hundred Tunisian immigrants staged a protest in the Italian border town of Ventimiglia on Saturday against what they said was a French policy to turn away would-be asylum seekers.</p>
<p>The immigrants were transferred to the town close to the French border from the tiny island of Lampedusa.</p>
<p>But living conditions appear to be no better than what they left behind.</p>
<p>One Tunisian immigrant told the crowd: &#8220;I have risked my life on a makeshift boat with despair and when I arrived in Italy I found I had nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>France is home to Europe&rsquo;s largest North African community and an estimated 600,00 [sic] Tunisians live there.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ahmed, a Tunisian would-be asylum seeker, got as far as Monaco, only to be picked up by police and sent back to Italy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not want to steal or do anything,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We just want safety. We want Europe to welcome us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Italy says it cannot cope with the influx on its own and wants France and other European partners to do more to help.</p>
<p>EU interior ministers will debate the issue at a meeting in Luxembourg on April the 11th.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 Tunisians have reached Lampedusa since January&rsquo;s popular uprising that ousted former president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.</p>
<p>The tiny island has a population of just 5,000 and is only 260 kilometres off Tunisia&rsquo;s east coast.</p>

		<p>According to this-</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/easok</p>
<p>They were Libyans.  346 more of which have arrived atop the 2500 already present.  36 were put up in a church by the parish priest and being kids, did something stupid to burn it down.</p>
<p>The refugees are complaining about lack of food, water and prompt delivery to continental Italy.</p>
<p>All&rsquo;s I can do is repeat what the blogger said: &#8220;Send them back.  Each and every one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note how overfull the boats are.  If one or two were to have a &#8216;terrible accident&rsquo; involving say a wake from a rescue craft that passed too close, too fast, there would be a big wake up call in Tunisia.</p>

		<p>The entire western world is rather like a beaten wife.  The husband beats her and beats her but she stays with him.  If the cops try to arrest him she will defend him, even to the point of assaulting the police herself.  She will sacrefice her children&rsquo;s well-being to stay with the abuser.  She will allow her children to be abused.  When she does manage to escape, after a brief respite she goes back to him.  Her parents and siblings give up on her. It frequently ends quite badly.  Sounds like the entire white western world.  </p>

<p>*One Tunisian immigrant told the crowd: &ldquo;I have risked my life on a makeshift boat with despair and when I arrived in Italy I found I had nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe thats because nothing in Italy is YOURS to find! I wouldn&rsquo;t find anything in Italy either!</p>
<p>*&ldquo;We do not want to steal or do anything,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Yes I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;do anything&#8221;, thats why you WILL steal - THATS the problem!</p>

		<p>Oh my God, these illegal immigrants simply arrive in Europe and expect to get a welcoming parade and 5 star hotel treatment, and then have the audacity to complain about their &#8216;mistreatment&rsquo;.  Nobody forced to come, and don&rsquo;t they have their freedom now that their dictator(Ben Ali) is gone.  The only people stupider then them are the liberal multiculuralists who tell everyone to &#8216;shut up and celebrate diversity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ventimiglia!   I know that place. It is a luxutrious resort town on the Italian Riviera,  right AT the French border, very close to Monte Carlo  and Nice.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re complaining! We whould all be so lucky as to be<br>
&#8220;refugees&#8221; oh the Riviera,  with all expenses paid. (I had to pay my own way.)</p>
<p>Why, WHY, in the world would North African refugees be sent to a chic place like that?  It boggles the mind.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re complaining.  The Riviera isn&rsquo;t good enough for them!  Well,  tut  tut.</p>
<p>And, also,  why are &#8220;would be asylum seekeers&#8221;  refered to so casually  as &#8220;immigrants&#8221;?  Isn&rsquo;t there a big difference?  I had thought so.   Isnt&rsquo; this taking  a lot for granted about their status?</p>
<p>I tell you, the best racket in the world today is being either a pirate or a refugee.  (Not much difference, really.)</p>

		<p>For any reader of this article to actually believe there are „borders&ldquo; in Europe this is simply not true. The EU borders are open and there are zero controls. In other words once these migrants are in the EU there is nothing to stop them from going on to the next country where they can choose exactly in which EU member state they wish to settle in. Many migrants have relatives in place and some have favourite countries in which they would prefer to establish themselves. There are arrangements in place to spread the immigrants to the various member states and this is going on quietly while a sham attempt is shown on TV to convince the citizens of Europe that the migrants are being turned back at borders that do not exist. </p>
<p> Immigration is a gift that keeps on giving the year around with immigrants from Asia and Africa arriving to seek asylum and of course receiving asylum by a system that works toward that end on a continuous basis. If anyone thinks this is not aided and abetted by the European elite one should think again. This influx of Africans is desired by the top level planners at the highest places in the EU. </p>
<p>At present and in the near future there will according to plan be an influx of 50 million Africans to replace the aging populations of Europe. Europe is being invaded and the gates are being opened from the inside. The bottom line is that the morally corrupt political and economic elites of Europe are making this all possible.<br>

		<p>Europe will not have to welcome these refugees. I&rsquo;m sure you will soon hear that Jimmy Obama will be welcoming these muslim refugees to the US. He&rsquo;s always looking for a way to pander to his fellow muslims, an important minority to Jimmy O.</p>

		<p>There is no &#8216;please&rsquo; or &#8216;thankyou&rsquo; with African/Middle Eastern immigrants.  They expect free housing, welfare, education, medical care, etc. as a RIGHT.  Note the &#8216;We want&hellip;&rsquo;.  It does not work if the indigenous population says it.  Trouble is all European governments see no problem with this.</p>

		<p>If they &#8220;just want safety&#8221; they have that at the refugee camp.  But safety and basic food, clothing and shelter is NOT enough.  They want Europe&rsquo;s Golden Handshake!  Welfare, schooling, middle-class housing, etc.</p>
<p>These people do NOT want to work, or even to learn the language of the country that they want to &#8220;welcome&#8221; them.  </p>
<p>SEND THEM BACK!  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m actually not too worried. I believe European nations will wake up long before the United States will. For Europe there&rsquo;s still time, for the US it&rsquo;s too late. The nationalist movements in Europe are growing exponentially in popularity because the current politicans are not listening to their people who are sick of being terrorized by these immigrants. Within 10 years Germany and Italy will put the brakes on multiculturalism; France and UK might be a different story&hellip;</p>

		<p>These are the kinds of people who degrade us and accuse us of being racist 24/7, yet they&rsquo;re basically saying they can&rsquo;t make it through life without us.</p>

		<p>If I recall correctly, Tunisia had a successful revolution a few weeks ago when this awful tyrant what&rsquo;s-his-name  was overthrown. Tunisia is a free and democratic country now, if we are to believe the MSM. Why are these people seeking asylum in Europe? Was the old regime better than what they have now? That would be the only reason why European countries should grant them asylum.</p>

		<p>Any wonder why &#8220;The Camp of Saints&#8221; is again on the best seller&rsquo;s list?</p>
<p>They flee the third world, to a predominately white nation -which they promptly begin turning into a carbon copy of the third world hell hole they fled in the first place.</p>
<p>And the governments elected to &#8216;protect&rsquo; us from just such invasion sit on their hands and do nothing.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that &#8220;you cannot have a first world country with a third world population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the spineless inactivity of various governments, you have to wonder if the real point is &#8216;you cannot have a third world country with a First world population&rsquo; -and a third world dictatorship is just what they are looking for.</p>
