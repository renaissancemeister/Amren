						<p>
							<i>Rebecca S. Green, Journal Gazette (Fort Wayne), March 23, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>A second woman has been charged in the killing of a 2-year-old whose body had been kept in a plastic tote.</p>
<p>On Monday, Allen County prosecutors filed charges against Natasha N. Hawkins, 31, of the 1900 block of Hobson Road, accusing her of participating in the death of 2-year-old Jezaih King.</p>
<p>Jezaih&rsquo;s mother, Latisha Lawson, 31, was charged late last year with battery causing death, neglect of a dependent causing death, neglect of a dependent causing injury, neglect of a dependent and battery. The additional charges accuse Lawson of beating and neglecting her 10-year-old daughter. On Feb. 11, prosecutors added an additional charge of murder against Lawson in connection with Jezaih&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The charges against Hawkins, filed in Allen Superior Court, include aiding in battery causing death, neglect of a dependent causing death, assisting a criminal and four counts of battery.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Hawkins actively participated in the events leading up to Jezaih&rsquo;s death, which both Hawkins and Lawson described to police as an exorcism.</p>
<p>Hawkins is accused of holding down Jezaih&rsquo;s legs and saying a prayer while Lawson poured a mixture of olive oil and vinegar down his throat in November 2009, believing, the women said, he and his sister were possessed by demons. </p>
<p>{snip} According to court documents, Lawson held Jezaih&rsquo;s mouth shut for about 10 minutes until he stopped struggling.</p>
<p>After the toddler died, Lawson told her daughter to come say goodbye to him, later putting the body on the bed for a period of time, court documents said. The girl told police she had to view the body and pray over him. </p>
<p>Lawson later wrapped the toddler&rsquo;s body in a blanket and put him in a closet, then into a plastic tote that she took with them when they moved, according to court documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police found the toddler&rsquo;s body inside a south-side home Dec. 21. The Allen County coroner ruled the death a homicide, caused by asphyxia from a compressed neck. When police caught up with Lawson and interviewed her, she said her son was &#8220;with God.&#8221;</p>
<p>She told detectives she could not tolerate his tantrums anymore and that she believed both her children were demon-possessed, according to court documents.</p>
<p>In late January, police interviewed Hawkins who said that she and Lawson performed an &#8220;exorcist&#8221; on Jezaih. Hawkins told police that she told Lawson &#8220;you should drink olive oil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to get rid of demons,&#8221; according to court documents.</p>
<p>It was Lawson&rsquo;s idea to add the vinegar, according to court documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hawkins&rsquo; own children were fed the concoction and all began to vomit. All the children were present when Jezaih died, according to court documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hawkins told police she never called police or emergency medical services to seek help for Jezaih and after his death home-schooled her children because she was afraid they would say something to the authorities, according to court documents.</p>

		<p>This is probably a woman suffering from Psychosis. If so, it does no credit for it to be posted here. Schizophrenia affects blacks too.</p>

<p>I bet these kids got some really good learning. Home schooled in what exactly? Probably NO schooling at all other than just sit in front of the TV all day.</p>

		<p>Oil and vinegar?  I wasn&rsquo;t aware giving kids salad dressing got rid of demons; I thought you were supposed to pour rum on their heads and set them on fire.  That&rsquo;s how they do it in New York, anyway (see article above).</p>
