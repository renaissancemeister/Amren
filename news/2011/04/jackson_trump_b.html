			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Smith, Politico, April 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rev. Jesse Jackson told POLITICO today that the birther movement is part of a larger pattern of rollbacks against civil rights and and an attack on the legitimacy of the nation&rsquo;s first African-American president  &mdash;  reserving special ire for developer Donald Trump and his renewed interest in the conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any discussion of his birthplace is a code word,&#8221; said Jackson. &#8220;It calls upon ancient racial fears.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jackson also pointed to a broader pattern of hostility towards civil rights  &mdash;  pointing to a number of events, including the battle over public sector unions, a transportation policy that he says disadvantages poor minority city dwellers, and a renewed interest in policies like voter ID.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most personal attacks on any president ever,&#8221; said Jackson, who pursued the Democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988  &mdash;  but says the political climate has changed. &#8220;Whose personal religion has ever been challenged before? That has strong racial overtones.&#8221;<br>

								<h2>Racism and Obama: We&rsquo;re on Our Way to the &lsquo;Most Racist&rsquo; Election in 2012</h2>
						<p>
							<i> D. Scriber, dscriber.com, April 27, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>There is no doubt that there have been some tensions over race since Barack Obama became the first black president of the United States in 2008. There&rsquo;ve been questionable depictions of Obama, unseemly watermelon jokes, embarrassing gaffes involving public officials, and even overt use of the N-word, all in either vague or direct reference to the president. Now pundit Tavis Smiley predicts that the 2012 election cycle will bring even more to the surface, predicting the &#8220;most racist in the history of this republic,&#8221; quite a statement considering the nation&rsquo;s history of slavery and segregation.</p>
<p>The PBS host made the remarks to MSNBC&rsquo;s Lawrence O&rsquo;Donnell, saying, &#8220;I said over a year ago that this was going to be, this presidential race, Lawrence, was going to be the ugliest, the nastiest, the most divisive, and the most racist .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the history of this republic. I did not know that race to the bottom would begin so quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He notes there have been more threats against Obama than any other president in the history of the country  &mdash;  &#8220;indeed presidents combined.&#8221;</p>

<p>You must be at least 18 and show ID to buy canned compressed air to clean out your computer.  But you don&rsquo;t need the same kind of ID to vote, and Jesse Jackson doesn&rsquo;t think you need to have one, and any such requirement is an abrogation of civil rights.  Not having one is an abrogation of civil rights&hellip;the civil rights of legitimate and legal voters, not to have their vote watered down by people who aren&rsquo;t legally allowed to vote.</p>

<p>Any discussion about anything is about race to Jackson.</p>

		<p>The more is given to blacks, the more they demand.  How about making them earn the welfare, affirmative action instead of giving all on a silver platter?  Due to this constant nonsense from blacks, the whites have lower themselves to their level instead of trying to bring them up. </p>

		<p>The diverse white Americans are too quick to forget that President Obama himself, prior to his election promoted two explicitly anti-white ideas.</p>
<p>One was his &#8220;acting white&#8221; remark on 7/24/07 which caricatured all young white American students as acting similarly and unworthy of emulating.  But it was his blithe smothering of their diversity into one category (&#8220;acting white&#8221;) that disclosed his mind to us as racist, relatively clumsy, but a racist.</p>
<p>Then on 3/20/08 he indulged himself in the racially-tainted phrase, &#8220;a typical white person.&#8221;  Most observers have accepted that phrase as a put-down of his grandmother, but the word &#8220;typical&#8221; means he thinks that all of the diverse white people can be summed up as identical.  Not so bad, readers might say, but in California, professionals have lost jobs over slight remarks about typical this or typical that.  What he said was a firing offense in California.</p>
<p>So once again we see that he views all white Americans as an undifferentiated lump, no diversity, no distinctive qualities, just typical.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental aspect of racism, and President Obama is very, very guilty.</p>

<p>President Obama is a blessing as, like an inner city youth with a can of spray paint, he simply cannot help himself. He is giving the American people reason to shed their &lsquo;cowardice&rsquo; and force an honest discussion on the topic of race. Honest debates allow greater numbers of people to discern Truth. </p>
<p>Notice that you don&rsquo;t hear the Left calling Race Realists &lsquo;ignorant&rsquo; anymore. That word has become a hanging curve ball. Thank you Barack.</p>

		<p>I hope that 2012 is the most &#8216;racist&rsquo; election and the Whites, even DWLs, will vote with a racial conscious in the privacy of the voting machine. If we still are allowed confidential votes. </p>
<p>if 2012 is not the most racist, we can look forward to 2016 as the most racially divisive as Obama will have four years to attack White institutions and society without fear of consequences. Expect anmesty for illegals, an even more insanely open borders policy and further African &#8216;refugees&rsquo; being settled in the USA; even more reparations for slavery, more hate crimes laws, attempts to censor the internet, more efforts to force the military, police, and fire departments to enact even more onerous diversity(read Anti-White) policies. And these are only the tip of the slagheap. Do you like free speech and firearms? No more. More and more wealth transfers from the productive to the lazy welfare bums. I&rsquo;ll stop before I think of more and more.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Any discussion of his birthplace is a code word,&rsquo; said Jackson. &lsquo;It calls upon ancient racial fears.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah Comrade Jackson, I always knew if I lived long enough and you did too, I would hear a truth from you!</p>
<p>A fear, &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; is not necessarily a bad thing; many people to this day fear spiders and snakes, big dogs and sharks, lions and tigers and bears, oh my! Is that &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; or &ldquo;obsolete?&rdquo; Of course not, because even with all our modern advances, creatures such as these are very real and can kill any human being quite swiftly. In fact, if there is any validity to the theory of preparedness in psychology, we are here because the majority of our ancestors instinctively (through evolution) encoded such fears.</p>
<p>The same holds true for &ldquo;ancient racial fears,&rdquo;  in that any race that assumes to demand that another race be allowed to dominate and eventually replace it through miscegenation and &ldquo;civil rights,&rdquo; is asking for a self-inflicted genocide on the part of that other race. It is sort of like allowing your children to play with a king cobra, and expect them to be &ldquo;enriched&rdquo; with a strengthened immune system and not simply be poisoned and die!</p>
<p>For the West and the whites who built it, and sustain it, you and your precious Comrade General Secretary  BO (a fool you once got caught on camera threatening to castrate) are that king cobra.<br>

		<p>I guess voting for a &#8220;black&#8221; man didn&rsquo;t heal the country of racism.  I doubt anyone here thought it would, if anything it makes blacks worse, they now feel even more entitled.  And for some reasons blacks think we ALWAYS go out of our way to ruin their everything.  And the only reason we fire blacks is their skin color.</p>
<p>Note to all employers, it is racist to fire a black person for the following reasons:  Constantly late, sexual harassment, stealing from work, violence, unqualified, loses money for the company, etc.</p>
<p>The reason?  Because they are black, not because they cannot do the job.  That is really how blacks thing.  Not the elite anti-white blacks like Jackson and Sharpton, they just tell the average black to believe this (and they do).</p>

How racist! (sarcasm)</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;This is the most personal attacks on any president ever,&rdquo;&#8221;&hellip; I strongly doubt that. Personal attacks are a staple of US politics and always have been. Obama has actually been shielded from most personal attacks because of his race.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Whose personal religion has ever been challenged before? That has strong racial overtones.&rdquo;&#8221;&hellip; If Obama&rsquo;s religion is hating white people, then that&rsquo;s highly relevant to whether he should be running a white country. If Obama&rsquo;s religion is Islam or Dhimmitude, then that makes him completely unable to defend the United States from the Islamists who are trying to take it over or blow it up.</p>

		<p><i> reserving special ire for developer Donald Trump and his renewed interest in the conspiracy theory.</i> </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a &#8220;birther,&#8221; but I wouldn&rsquo;t call the movement a &#8220;conspiracy theory.&#8221; A conspiracy theory involves a large number of people all conspiring to keep something a secret. Obama could clear up the issue by simply producing a few documents. It seems to me it&rsquo;s just one man who&rsquo;s conspiring to keep something a secret.</p>
<p><i>Now pundit Tavis Smiley predicts that the 2012 election cycle will bring even more to the surface, predicting the &ldquo;most racist in the history of this republic,&rdquo; quite a statement considering the nation&rsquo;s history of slavery and segregation.</i> </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an idiotic statement and simply shows blacks&rsquo; tendency towards hysteria and hyperbole, not to mention an incredible ignorance of history. </p>
<p>What about Lincoln&rsquo;s statement during the Lincoln-Douglas debates that he did not consider the races to be equal and could think of no greater calamity than integration?</p>
<p>Of course, Smiley would like us to forget about that, at least until it comes time to take the names of all those racist &#8220;dead white men&#8221; off all public buildings and institutions.</p>

<p>Yes, Revrun Jay-Jay, you are right: it IS coded speech for racial fears. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that white people WANT to speak in code; nor that we are inherently deceptive. White people are nowadays FORCED to speak in code because anti-white agitators like you have been extremely successful at shutting up more direct and straightforward speech on racial matters. Until racially-aware white folks are able to say in public the kinds of things we can say here on AmRen   &mdash;   without losing our jobs or risking physical attack   &mdash;   then whites will have no choice but to continue with our code words. </p>

		<p>Jesse James has not changed one bit since 1966. His thought process is the same and the normal mental maturation has not occurred as it would in an ordinary person.</p>
<p>And the man too seems to have a lot upstairs [?] but the man never got beyond the hate filled and confrontation aspect of his life much for the worse for him and the rest of us. It did not have to be that way but is has become so for some time.</p>

		<p>I think this reflects poorly on Obama.  He had his birth certificate all this time, yet he created drama.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago, I had to fly to Europe on business.  I didn&rsquo;t have a copy of my birth certificate, so I had to fly to Chicago to get a copy (I was not born in Chicago, but they have a processing office there).</p>
<p>Obama played games with his birth certificate.  He had it in his pocket all this time while pretending it was missing.  Very jevenile behavior.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t we all racist?  If not, we should be. Forget that word anyway. They only use it against Whites, not blacks, in the first place as it was intended.</p>
<p>It is ONLY Whites that are vilified for being &#8220;racists&#8221; and blacks are &#8220;entitled&#8221; to be racists. Let us not condemn anyone for being a racist, let us just tell them they have a right to be racist and so do we! If we keep responding to THEIR &#8220;racism&#8221; as evil, then our own &#8220;racism&#8221; is evil. Has anyone ever seen that word &#8220;racism&#8221; or any meaning of the word thereof, in the Bible as a sin? NO! God set up boundries (borders,lands) for His people for a reason. We are now seeing that reason.</p>
<p> Preserving one&rsquo;s race (White race) is a NATURAL response when one race (nonwhites) tries to take over another race in their own homelands. More Whites need to realize this.  This is why a multiracial nation will never survive and we will be on the losing end(as we are now)if we do not start claiming our God given right to preserve our WHITE race in our own lands. </p>
<p>Those of us on amren KNOW their game so why do we keep playing it on their terms and not on our terms?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s basically no where to hide if you are too dumb to be an engineer. I&rsquo;ve never seen a black engineer. </p>
<p>Sadly, we are filled with 3 million really terrible dumb Indian engineers (75 percent unemployment for American engineers) and of 10 engineers here from India I notice if I look carefully that 2 tend to do the work of the whole group. Most are incompetent and require years of extra training to learn even a basic job that an American could just do from the start.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t let Jesse Jackson drive you crazy. If you let him get under your skin, all you&rsquo;re doing is jacking up your blood pressure for no good reason. Jackson&rsquo;s an irritant, but he&rsquo;s something like seventy years old and considering the fact that the average life expectancy for males in the United States is around eighty or something, we can look forward to a Jackson-free environment in around ten years, more or less. Of course, the former United States will be a steaming pile of rubble by then, thanks in part to race hustlers like Jackson, but never mind that. Just try to put things in perspective.</p>

		<p>I am SICK AND TIRED of people attacking those other people who question Obama&rsquo;s religion.  He is a muslim.  He himself stated he was a muslim.</p>
<p>It happened on the very first sit down with a liberal main stream media commentator ( I forget exactly which one now, but on the order of Peter Jennings or Brian Williams).  During that first sit down on national TV the commentator asked him the direct question:  &#8220;Many Americans would like to know about your faith - your religion.  What would you tell them?&#8221;  Obama answered quite clearly &#8220;I am a muslim&#8221;.  I saw it.  I watched it live, on TV.  I heard it from his own mouth.  When he said that, the commentator almost bolted from his chair, and said very quickly &#8220;You mean, you&rsquo;re a Christian, correct?&#8221;  And Obama picked up on his faux pas and said yes, that was what he meant, he was thinking about something else when he answered.  Right.  Sure he was.  I saw that whole thing, and heard that whole thing, live, on TV.  We never saw that again, did we?  It was scrubbed. Two questions which will testify to the truth of that moment of honesty:  Whom does he support in the world?  Radical Islamists, or our traditional allies?  What kind of &#8220;churches&#8221; does he attend?  True Christian churches preaching Jesus as Salvation, or race baiting black churches more akin with Nation of Islam in their doctrine and hatreds?  Finally, if you realize he is a muslim, it explains why he actually bowed to the Saudi King, and kissed his hand in fealty.  ALL muslims do that to the keeper of the two most important shrines in Islam - Mecca and Medina.  Obama is a muslim.  Notice he has NEVER pronounced any kind of National Day of Prayer or Christmas or Easter message as other presidents have done.  He HAS however never failed to make a pronouncement honoring Muslim holidays.  Hasn&rsquo;t he?</p>

		<p>@22 Anon,</p>
<p>You are correct sir.  Except that &#8216;white race&rsquo; = &#8216;white power&rsquo; to a lot of pundits and that carries baggage from the K and the Nazis.</p>
<p>Further, we have many, many, traitors in our ranks who fail to see that a fear of white -male- power, drawing them into alliances with other &#8216;weaker&rsquo; parties (women and the social marxist liberalists whose sputum would otherwise have never gained traction with sensible people) will not respond to this with a defiance that takes us all over the edge in to darkness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing here.  As long as they focus on us, the &#8216;hateful racists&rsquo;, they will never fear the precipice they are charging towards enough to pull on the handbrake of this Indy like minecart we are caught in with the &#8216;multiculturalists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There can be no appeasement of blacks because they want everything.  There can be no warning of weak whites who are blind to statistics they either do not see or do not believe in as truth not tainted.</p>
<p>The lesson to be learned from the blacks is that to cajole you must first embrace a segment of society which then responds to your vision as the warmth you share with them, like it or hate it, it must be a genuine view of &#8216;sink or swim, together&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Courtesy of puberty, females are anywhere from 4-10 points less intelligent than most males but their -average- intelligence is more uniform.  They also make up 52% of our population.</p>
<p>Start there.  And bring people into line, not by challenging them in their own world view but by making them feel less isolated in their left-behind sense of yours.  Embrace whiteness as a living warmth, not a factual superiority.  And we will go farther with the empaths and &#8216;artists&rsquo; of our country.  At which point, if there is still time, we can begin shaping their views with what we see as possible alternatives to the coming default and destruction of our country.</p>

		<p>I wonder, is there anybody alive, who remember Barack Obama from his college years? Maybe some kind of monetary bonus will help to restore the memory. Something is very fishy about his past. We should create a pool so people could donate for this worthy cause.</p>

		<p>I am white, so if I attack any black elected official, I must be racist.  No proof needed. Now, that is what I call logical.</p>

Good points.  We need to start talking about the white &#8220;community&#8221;.  How&rsquo;s that for warmth?  Why does everyone but us get to exhult in their &#8220;community&#8221;.</p>
<p>We need to teach our children about their traditional culture whether American or European.  Let them listen to classical music and folk music, take them to traditional art museums.  Teach them about their cultural heroes especially the founders of this country.</p>
