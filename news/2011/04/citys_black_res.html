<h1>City&rsquo;s Black Residents Now Top All Groups</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Matza, Kia Gregory, and John Duchneskie, Philadelphia Inquirer, April 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African descendants have called Philadelphia home for centuries, with the first U.S. Census, in 1790, listing 2,099 &#8220;free&#8221; blacks and 373 slaves.</p>
<p>Today, the city&rsquo;s black population is 644,287, according to the latest census, and for the first time it clearly outnumbers all other racial or ethnic groups.</p>
<p>This evolution happened even though the number of African Americans in the city, excluding Hispanics, declined about 1,800 over the last decade and their share of the population remained about the same.</p>
<p>Key to the new black plurality: the continued steep decline in the city&rsquo;s white population. In 2000, each group accounted for about 42 percent of city residents, but the white share is now 37 percent, after a loss of 82,000 people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an influx of Hispanics, Asians, and other groups  &mdash;  now 21 percent of the city&rsquo;s 1.5 million people  &mdash;  boosted Philadelphia&rsquo;s total for the first time in 50 years.</p>
<p>The black plurality coincides with another trend: More and more middle- and working-class African Americans are leaving the city for suburbia. Since 2000, the black population of the city&rsquo;s Pennsylvania suburbs jumped 26 percent  &mdash;  by 47,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Migrating to the suburbs</b></p>
<p>Across Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware, and Chester Counties, the proportion of black residents grew in 176 of 238 municipalities, mirroring a national trend, though still fewer than 10 percent of Philadelphia-area suburbanites are black.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, said Norristown municipal administrator David Forrest, mortgages &#8220;were more available to whites than blacks,&#8221; leading to &#8220;primarily white suburbanization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black upward mobility and more available credit, particularly in the last decade, he said, spurred movement to inner-ring suburbs, especially in southeastern Delaware County, where better schools, lower housing density, and public transportation lured people from Southwest Philadelphia, including large numbers of African immigrants.</p>

		<p>Of course, the whites leaving will say &#8220;oh, we left because of the crime&#8221; but they won&rsquo;t really even admit to themselves or to others.  Then the same people/problems they ran away from will follow them, then they will move again, and say, &#8220;oh, we left because of the crime&#8221; and the cycle will repeat itself.</p>

		<p>If I were a black, I&rsquo;d get a bit nervous looking at a demographic map.  Most all of them are in urban areas surrounded by whites in the suburbs and countryside, and their leaders are inciting them to levels approaching pre-civil war conditions, as financial situations worsen throughout the entire West.</p>

Philadelphia lossed its reputation due to black crime.</p>
<p>Whites in the corporate sector improved the cities outlook but their advocacy of multiculturalism proves that they are  spinning their wheels at the cost of their race and posterity.</p>

		<p>As always, there&rsquo;s no negative tone to white flight in Philadelphia. If this were a protected minority group losing population, Lord knows there would be outcry from the media.</p>
<p>On a side note, I am pleasantly surprised how white the suburban areas of Philly seem to be. I just did a quick search on the NY times demographic map, and there are many areas over 90% white. (for now)</p>

		<p>I grew up in Philadelphia in the late &rsquo;70s in one of the last  white parts of the city (far northeast). I then worked downtown in the &rsquo;80s and it was no prize then. But, the last ten years have seen the city turn into a jungle of crime and poverty. All of the city is now rotting from black dispersion and immigrant squalor. </p>
<p>It is sad to see what has become of this city. My parents would not recognize the horror that it is today. Blacks have absolutely ruined the culture and stability of every part of the city. The few relatives I have that remain (including several holdouts in south Philly) talk of crime and corruption far worse than what is reported in the press. They will be gone soon as well and then it will morph into a giant Camden.</p>
<p>Ben Franklin would not believe his bifocals.</p>

		<p><em>Going from virtually all white to virtually all black is certainly no triumph of coexistence, Puriefoy-Brinkley acknowledged, but she feels the pattern of movement has been basically positive.</em></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Maybe the upside,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is that people who didn&rsquo;t have opportunities to live in decent housing or walkable communities have those opportunities now.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Buildings don&rsquo;t make ghettos, people do.  What was decent housing will soon become a Detroit-like hell hole.  Just like perfectly good brand new public housing nearly immediately becomes Africa-like.</p>

		<p>I grew up in Philadelphia in a time when the city was probably seventy five to eighty percent white, maybe more.  Over the past several decades the reversal has been dramatic.  Whites have been leaving in droves.</p>
<p>The city is now an overwhelmingly black and Hispanic dung heap, with Asians of all stripes mixed in for variety. There are pockets of middle and lower working class white neighborhoods that are half decent.  They&rsquo;re in the minority, though.  But the old grandeur that historically was Philadelphia is mostly gone, confined to Center City and some neighboring and scattered areas where relics remain.  Others are more akin to the Third world than the Western world.</p>
<p>Murders, robberies, assaults, and random killings are ubiquitous <br>
The municipal workers (usually not a very highly developed lot in the first place) are the most ignorant, incompetent, rude, hostile, and belligerent cretins it would ever be your misfortune to meet. The police force here is and has always been as brutal and corrupt an entity as you could find anywhere. </p>
<p>The only time I go to the city is for some kind of cultural or sporting event.  Other than that I avoid it like the plague.</p>
<p>You remember that.  The Black Death. </p>

		<p>As someone who also grew up in Northeast Philadelphia and moved out the suburbs (or civilization as we call it), I would like to point out that blacks have been close to a majority in the City for at least 30 to 40 years.  Must whites don&rsquo;t move to the suburbs just to escape crime, they move because they have no other real choice.  You can&rsquo;t send your children to the Philadelphia public schools.  The lack of diversity in the school system is really a very serious and alarming problem!  What has really destroyed the large american cities is not so much the mere presence of blacks but the fair housing acts and school desegregation - both of which have been a complete failure.  </p>

<p>The ones I&rsquo;ve talked to don&rsquo;t mention crime because it&rsquo;s too obvious what they&rsquo;re talking about. No, they came out here &#8220;because of the better schools&#8221;. Well, who made the Philly schools so bad that you had to flee? And why are you making us pay $20K a year to school each of your kids because you think throwing money at the teachers will make them better?</p>

<p>You pretty much nailed it re. Philly  today. I grew up near 24th &amp; Indiana ave, six blocks from Connie Mack Stadium. It was a predominantly Italo-American neighborhood where people would scrub their front steps and the pavement in front of their 16 foot &#8220;airlight&#8221; houses. In the mid to late sixties within five years it was reduced  to a toilet by the advent of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.<br>
The campuses of Temple, Penn/ Drexel, La Salle, &amp; St. Josephs Universities were not safe even back then. Today they&rsquo;re even worsed. When I was a grad. student at Temple, there were several coeds who were raped on campus and one law student shot dead while getting into his car.</p>
<p>Our present situation is possibly even worse than that of the Boer farmers who are at least shooting back.<br>

		<p>What can I say?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Black upward mobility and more available credit, &hellip; including large numbers of African immigrants.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Our government is killing us.  With housing vouchers for African _immigrants_.  That we cannot get for our own poor whites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new housing market is underwritten by the simple assurance that whites will run before they will live with blacks or other ethnies (and who knows who is actually running that racket these days).</p>
<p>While whites, probably foolishly, are -scattering- themselves, away from each other and the centralized infrastructure support which means that when the oil runs dry and/or the USD tanks and we can&rsquo;t buy anything with it, we will be out in the boondocks of the exurbs.  &#8216;Safe for the moment&rsquo; but also without jobs or access to cheap goods which will of a certainty be delivered by government run rail and other mass transit (we may go back to steam or wood gas) to &#8216;centralized distribution points&rsquo; aka cities.</p>
<p>Your home will be worthless, your exclusive isolation will cripple you in terms of delivered goods and services and the ethnies will welcome you back like Kotter: with open hands and predatory glares when you come slinking in to what will be -their- territory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fools quest.  Not least because we are eating up farmland and wildlife preserves in the process of making a housing development from coast to coast.</p>
<p>We need to plan.  To Separate.  And to hold a line.</p>

		<p>This is especially painful for me.  I grew up in South Philly during the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.  When my kids approached school age in the 90&rsquo;s, I sent them to Catholic school.  When I had the chance, I moved my family out to Lancaster, PA.  Everything was great until hoards of Dominicans and Puerto Ricans came into the suburbs of Lancaster County. I still have friends who remain in the neighborhood and are the ones who are still in denial of HBD.  </p>
<p>These days, I have friends in the arts who are not from the city who have moved into South Philly and they are shocked, shocked at the crime. My old neighborhood is a Third World pool now.  I told them that&rsquo;s why I moved out and they were welcome to come and move into my &#8220;racist&#8221; neighborhood where I can walk the streets at night.  </p>
