<h1>Protest the White Privilege Conference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Thomas, E-mail Curculat (joethomas88@comcast.net), April 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>April 13th marks the beginning of the 12th Annual White Privilege Conference at the Sheraton Hotel in Bloomington, Minnesota.</p>
<p>This event is being sponsored by such left wing institutions as the St. Paul Foundation, the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Office for Equity and Diversity, and the Minneapolis YWCA.</p>
<p>The White Privilege Conference offers three days of liberal indoctrination on &#8220;white guilt&#8221; and &#8220;social justice.&#8221; This is the same old propaganda that says White Men are responsible for all the poverty and injustice in the world, and the only solution is more laws and welfare programs.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of &#8220;White Privilege&#8221; from their <b>website:</b></p>
<p>&#8220;White people can go out in public without fear of being harassed or constantly worried about physical safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reality check: According to the National Crime Victimization Survey for 2001-2003 Blacks were 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against Whites than vice versa. Blacks were also 2.25 times more likely to commit a hate crime against Whites or Hispanics than vice versa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being able to assume that if you work hard and follow the rules, you will get what you deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reality check: Generous social welfare benefits such as food stamps, Section 8 housing, and school lunch programs are available to poor and minorities. Meanwhile, for working Americans, the more they earn the more they have to pay in taxes to support such programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being able to assume that most of the people you or your children study in history classes and textbooks will be of the same race, gender, or sexual orientation as you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reality check: Millions of dollars are spent in public schools to raise awareness and teach children about figures such as Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, and W.E.B DuBois. Martin Luther King Jr. is the only American to have his own holiday and the entire month of February is dedicated to Black History. The above claim is simply a part of the liberal agenda to remove &#8220;Old White Men&#8221; such as the Founding Fathers from American schools and abandon traditional values.</p>
<p>Dear friends, it is time to show the liberal left, that us hardworking Americans are not feeling the &#8220;privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>On April 13th-16th, 20011, Wednesday thru Saturday, 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Please join us to protest their event:<br>

								<h2>12th Annual White Privilege Conference Schedule</h2>
						<p>What is Privilege?</p>
<p>&#8220;White Privilege is the other side of racism. Unless we name it, we are in danger of wallowing in guilt or moral outrage with no idea of how to move beyond them. {snip} once we understand how white privilege operates, we can begin addressing it on an individual and institutional basis.&#8221; ~Paula Rothenberg</p>
<p>&#8220;Privilege exists when one group has something of value that is denied to others simply because of the groups they belong to, rather than because of anything they&rsquo;ve done or failed to do. {snip}&#8221; ~Peggy McIntosh</p>
<p>Examples of Privilege</p>
<p>Being able to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>* assume that most of the people you or your children study in history classes and textbooks will be of the same race, gender, or sexual orientation as you are</p>
<p>* assume that your failures will not be attributed to your race, or your gender</p>
<p>* assume that if you work hard and follow the rules, you will get what you deserve</p>
<p>* success without other people being surprised; and without being held to a higher standard</p>
<p>* go out in public without fear of being harassed or constantly worried about physical safety</p>
<p>* not have to think about your race, or your gender, or your sexual orientation, or disabilities, on a daily basis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>WPC is About Creating Change!</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites need to acknowledge and work through the negative historical implications of &#8216;Whiteness&rsquo; and create for ourselves a transformed identity as White people committed to equity and social change .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To teach my White students and my own children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that there are different ways of being White, and that they have a choice as White people to become champions of justice and social healing.&#8221; ~Gary Howard</p>

		<p>It is really quite shocking that this event incorporates blessings by Indian tribal leaders, drum ceremonies, and a Shabbat dinner in observance of the Jewish sabbath.  This is an event put on by the University of Colorado, a state institution.  What would happen if a governmental agency put on an event like this with 1) blessings by Catholic priests; 2) performance by the Metro Lutheran Choir; and 3) eucharistic communion in observance of the Christian sabbath?</p>

		<p>&#8216;White privilege&rsquo;? What&rsquo;s that? I don&rsquo;t see any evidence of that in the UK these days. We indigenes are now officially discriminated against by our own legal and employment system. As can be seen from the following case of an English schoolboy being attacked by a hammer-wielding mob of Mohammedans, their can be no officially-acknowledged &#8216;racism&rsquo; or confessional hatred when the aggressors aren&rsquo;t white: </p>

		<p>&#8220;assume that your failures will not be attributed to your race, or your gender&#8221;</p>
<p>I kind of assume my failures are the fault of affirmative action and &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; indoctrination. I wish these white privilege gurus felt the same way. The fact they don&rsquo;t can only be attributed to their being educated to the point of ignorance. Or as I say &#8216;educated ignorance&rsquo;. Perhaps a seminar on that topic would be a more useful, and realistic, presentation.</p>

		<p>I have difficulty understanding the continued existence of the guilt stricken white liberal. During the War in Vietnam white male college students, who understandably did not want to be shot at in Vietnam, had reason to reach out to blacks as political allies in the anti war movement. Also, back then it was easier to blame black social pathology on racial discrimination. Neither of those reasons exist any more. </p>

		<p>This is anti-White.  It&rsquo;s important to call it anti-White, because it (a) stakes out the White identity (b) proclaims it has valid interests to advance and (c) brings the idea mainstream.</p>
<p>This is an ANTI-WHITE movement, and As A White Man (speaking in My White Voice) I am opposed to this vicious attack on the White race.</p>

		<p>I would love to be on the mind-altering medication these people are on. I&rsquo;ll tell my Mom the next time I see her that she&rsquo;s so blessed to live in one of the poorest cities in America (Cleveland, Ohio) and one of the most crime-ravaged. 70% black to be exact. I doubt she can even go to lunch in the neighborhood she works in (90% black) because it&rsquo;s in an old run down industrial part of town, but her boss let&rsquo;s the workers leave at 3:30 in the afternoon, because the drug dealers and thugs come out late in the afternoon. Her boss is a black guy and successful, and he doesn&rsquo;t even want to be around that area at night. Nice White privilege, huh?</p>

		<p>The name of this conference is quite Orwellian. This conference of course is not held in West Virginia. One of the Whitest and poorest states in the Union. Will there be a adequate supply of Soma to get through the conference. BTW The American Renaissance conference are always held on a weekend. But for some reason this conference is being held Wednesday thru Friday. Not good for white people who work for a living. If they were any where near me I would myself take a day off to attend.</p>

		<p>A few years back Monty Python could make a sketch on something as out of whack as this and we would all laugh at the satire. How could this be considered even slightly normal? We whites who have not gone insane should feel privileged (pardon the bad but ironic usage of the word) to be so worthy of such mindless attention. </p>

		<p>* Not have to think about your race, or your gender, or your sexual orientation, or disabilities, on a daily basis <br>
<p><br>
Blacks are always thinking about their race.  &ldquo;Gays&rdquo; are always thinking about their &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo;, and crippled people are always thinking about their handicap.<br>
<p><br>
Thinking about and dwelling on their difference makes them a powerful political force.  If white people start thinking about themselves as white it will mean an end to the stealth assaults on white people.<br>
<p><br>
So do think about White Privilege and do understand how you are hated and victimized because you are white.<br>

		<p> By all means, anyone who can get there, should attend, and ask some of these &#8220;embarrassing&#8221; (to the Left) questions about this so-called &#8220;White Privilege.&#8221; This shows we hew to a higher standard than our opponents do; they try to either disrupt or even prevent our conferences.

		<p>The term &#8220;White privilege&#8221; seems to replace &#8220;White racism&#8221; for this reason: It&rsquo;s too easy to refer to &#8220;black racism&#8221; in the minds of liberals.</p>

		<p>Just like every other leftist wallow, this one will celebrate not just what is anti-white, but also anti-Christian, anti-male, and anti-heterosexual.  And how many of these seemingly self-hating individuals would trade their white skin for a black one or their sexual orientation for an opposite one?  </p>

		<p>White privilege is<br>
&hellip;.&#8221;assume that if you work hard and follow the rules, you will get what you deserve&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is like the flip side of the mentality that says that employers who conduct credit checks on <b>all</b> job candidates, are somehow being deliberately racist to black applicants, because as a group they have worse credit ratings than other groups.</p>
<p>Noticing, acknowledging and/or avoiding negative black behavior is seen as being the ultimate sin. Likewise is noticing, acknowledging and/or celebrating positive White behavior an equal sin.</p>
<p>Liberals see zero possibility in the idea that positive (White) or negative (black) behavioral patterns could be due to inherent abilities or deficiencies. Unless of course you reverse the polarities at look at black success stories in the areas of &lsquo;the arts&rsquo;, sports or politics, then seeing their inherent talents realized is Ok.</p>
<p>A question I&rsquo;d like to ask these people, is whether they see the manifestation of White privilege as being &lsquo;culturally evil&rsquo; i.e. socially learned and encouraged thus could be practiced by many other groups in other countries, or as being a uniquely White Phenomenon, possibly an <i>inherent negative White trait</i>, so in other words Black people are kept down, but us White folks are simply born bad. <br>
I doubt these folks would be silly enough to fall into that contradictive trap, but makes me wonder.</p>
<p>What if we can&rsquo;t all &lsquo;be cured&rsquo; of our anti-social tendencies, then what does that make all of this? One big nation destroying experiment gone wrong and is there a &lsquo;final solution&rsquo; waiting for us if we don&rsquo;t &lsquo;roll over&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to learn that the reason why our detractors call us pro-White advocates &ldquo;supremacists&rdquo; is not so much because we go about beating our chests, proclaiming superiority in all endeavors cerebral and physical. That would be a silly claim.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am full of racial pride, but I see that the equality that all racial groups actually and sincerely do enjoy, comes from the fact that we all do have our own areas of excellence, expertise and specialization. </p>
<p>As we see time and time again the same racial hierarchy is expressed in the order of black, White and Asian, ascending or descending in numerous (ironically)diverse areas such as; rates of criminal perpetration, fertility rates, age of sexual maturation,  life expectancy, suicide rates, rates of STD infection, ability to financial plan, athletic ability, academic testing scores, musical ability from freestyle harmonic, rhythmic percussion based on one extreme to exactly executed classical notation used on the other, likewise with racial attitudes and behaviorisms from high self-esteem, extroverted, extreme individualism(&lsquo;big chief&rsquo;) to the humble, studious, introverted and self sacrificing for the collective(ism) and so on. <br>
There is no master race, just the right race for the right situation or at least from a particular situation.</p>
<p>We pro-Whites are labeled as being arrogant (and ignorant) &lsquo;supremacists&rsquo; not so much for we ourselves thinking that we ought to dominate all others, but truthfully because <b>we want our people to live to, and fulfill our true potential</b>. <br>
To stand up tall, against the constant message that you ought to &ldquo;live on your knees&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If our detractors feel the need of accusing us of being supreme, when we strive to live to our potential, (back handed compliment aside) that&rsquo;s their problem. </p>
<p>When White folks are encouraged to &ldquo;Dismantle their privilege&rdquo; (using this organizations language) thus are being actively encouraged to destroy the last form of covert White cohesion that exists. <br>
Covert because we all know that there is no accepted (above ground) pro White organization that is allowed to exist to face the genuine problems that our people face. </p>
<p>Us pro Whites need a universally accepted mission statement, and we need to secure the ability to accurately describe ourselves, as our potential supporters are being misled into thinking that we are a lot less realistic and sympathetic than we really are. A line that one of the journalist&rsquo;s wrote on the 2011 Amren conference&rsquo;s cancelation that haunted me was something along the lines of &ldquo;now this group knows what it is like being the one discriminated against&rdquo;, it made us sound like a bunch of jerks. </p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t practice discrimination outwardly on an individual level; I see it as pointless and rude.<br>
Again though when you look at behavioral data on the group level, even an just anecdotally (personal observations) it&rsquo;s hard to discount that positive and negative patterns emerge, positive and negative are of course relative terms so let&rsquo;s say measureable inequalities. </p>
<p>Once you see the groups, then you can&rsquo;t help but notice the vrying demographic ratios and quantifications of these contrasting groups and this is where we get those majority/minority comparisons. <br>
Acknowledging these differences is valid, especially when we hear so much about how awful the minority experience is. <br>
Who would wish that status upon themselves or their children?  </p>
<p>I never hear liberals talk of specific ratios or limits when it comes to mixing groups; it seems to be all or nothing. <br>
I can tolerate 5%, even 10% diversity depending on the scale of the situation (workplace to nation), but there&rsquo;s no talk of leeway ever, you just have to accept it all!<br>
 <br>
These people want us all to be the same. <br>
So when all of our manufacturing and high tech jobs go to the third world, and then all the third world people who want to, come and live with us.<br>
We&rsquo;re all on the same level.<br>
Such as with a related organization to this one being discussed, the &lsquo;P&rsquo; for poverty in SPLC doesn&rsquo;t stand for the eternal excuse that liberals roll out for all unequal behavior, but more so for their end game goal for White people&rsquo;s finances, <br>
&lsquo;Equality through poverty&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After getting past the fact that these sort of anti-White privilege groups are allowed to exist.<br>
Thinking about the types of people who work in these groups. <br>
I find the idea of a non-White working to destroy White privilege offensive, but then I can understand it a bit in that it&rsquo;s someone on who sees themself on &lsquo;the outside&rsquo;, trying to break down the perceived or imagined barrier.</p>
<p>But then I find the idea of a fellow White, who is also working to destroy (their own) group&rsquo;s privilege, even more disgusting. As of course any guilt filled individual White can quickly de-burden themselves of their own privilege, but the fact that these people are working to take down other Whites. <br>
What do you call that? <br>

		<p>I assume the conference is being held in Minneapolis because it is a liberal, large, central location, without huge racial problems. The dates have probably been chosen because many of the activities are geared toward teachers, who will have the time off for Easter/Passover break. If you read the entire description you will find that teachers receive continuing education credits for participation, credits they need to remain certified and to continue working. Thus a major purpose of the conference is to teach the teachers, so that they can pass on the message about guilt for &#8220;white privilege&#8221; to their students. It is a pity that white nationalism has not focused on organizing the young, and that it is mainly the domain of middle aged men preaching to the choir.  </p>

		<p>The globalists have infiltrated every level of our society; the multinational corporations, the major unions,both political parties, state and local governments and the educational system from the college level on down.  It is because of our iniquities that this has happened to our country. This is an indoctrination into the future of the way we will be controlled.  The group that is the most dangerous to this future is the ones they seek to marginalize and destroy.</p>

 I live in Rhode Island and have noted that this anti-white European bigotry is fed to students at local colleges, even one that &#8220;claims&#8221; to be Catholic. However, let&rsquo;s demand the following.<br>
 From what I have seen, the vast majority of those advocating this garbage are Leftist academics who despise Western Culture and are themselves members of the despised group. They wallow in the advantages of permanent, high salaried positions which were only possible through what our Culture and Society created. I have noted that they not only work but live in communities that are far less diverse than that which they demand for the rest of us. <br>
 Therefore: all White academics must resign from their tenured positions and demand they be replaced by &#8220;people of color&#8221;. They must renounce their pensions and healthcare so that the &#8220;poor&#8221; may benefit. They must publicly debase themselves at the feet of welfare queens and beg forgiveness for their &#8220;sins&#8221;. In addition, they must move out of majority White neighborhoods and move into Section 8 housing.<br>
 This is the only way they can counter their own &#8220;privileged&#8221; status, institutional racists that they are.</p>

		<p>(Star Tribune)  &mdash;  These are tough times for Minnesota schools.</p>
<p>In Lakeville, for example, the school board recently announced wrenching cuts of almost $7 million. Ninety-four teachers will lose their jobs, arts programs will suffer and a school will be closed.</p>
<p>There was wailing and gnashing of teeth, but the board set its jaw: There&rsquo;s not a dime for anything extra.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve got an ax to grind with white folks. Then the money spigots open.</p>
<p>The Lakeville schools are sending a delegation of teachers to the 12th annual &ldquo;White Privilege Conference&rdquo; at the Bloomington Sheraton from Aug. 13-16. The district is shelling out $160 a pop  &mdash;  plus $125 a day for teacher subs  &mdash;  for this &ldquo;white guilt&rdquo; festival.</p>
<p>Organizers say they expect attendees from a number of other Minnesota districts.</p>
<p>The conference is &ldquo;built on the premise that the U.S. was started by white people, for white people,&rdquo; according to conference materials. Its mission is to get participants to confront their biases in a &ldquo;journey in understanding white supremacy, whiteness, privilege, power and oppression,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;agree to take action in [their] own circle of power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conference is sponsored by the Minnesota Justice Collaborative, a consortium of local higher-education and philanthropic institutions. It is expected to draw 1,500 teachers, students, activists, artists, social workers and counselors from more than 40 states. Minnesota public schools are represented on the list of speakers and workshop presenters&hellip;..</p>

		<p>When younger, I used to be more or less sympathetic to the globalists. That was when I was much younger and much more naive.  It seemed the trendy, chic thing to do. It was pretty much expected.</p>
<p>That was up until I started to realize that they were anti-me! Yes, they were against ME!  Everything they supported was against my own best interests.  They were hostile to me and my people.  Why on earth would I suport a movement that was against me and my kind?  I would have to be crazy!  I am not a masochist, and I do not hate my people. So I eventually became a WN.</p>
<p>Have those other trendy young leftists, who are just going along with the flow, ever stopped to realize what suicidal nonsense this is?  Have they ever stopped to REALLY THINK of the end results of those policies?  Evidently not.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t panic, Multiculturalism on the way out. When the shine finally wears off the liberal model and we see the rise of ethnocentric societies that have a seriousness about them we simply don&rsquo;t have anymore ( e.g. China) the ethics of wasted effort will collapse. We can&rsquo;t afford to subsidize poor outcomes anymore. I am afraid bare-knuckle social Darwinism is at play now. If liberal blue-staters cannot keep their deficits in line they won&rsquo;t be able to continue to function in the years ahead.<br>

		<p>According to the anti-racists, you experience white privilege if you &#8220;do not have to think about your race on a daily basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic how those who seek to fight white privilege would do so by instituting policies like, say, open border immigration policies which will so upset the historic demographics in the US in such a way that NO ONE will have a future where one won&rsquo;t have to be constantly cognizant of their race.</p>
<p>Apparently, the cure for our blissful unawareness of race as a white majority is to have our children forced to live in a country with constant racial struggle. Thanks a lot anti-racists!</p>

You are right. We need to put out our message in such a way to the mainstream media can&rsquo;t define us for our enemies anymore.<br>
 We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.<br>
 We whites demand the right granted to all humans to preserve our ethnic identity. All peoples have an innate preferences for their own kind and prejudices against outgroups. This is not wrong, it is a natural evolutionary mechanism for survival. Whites are now being systematically discriminated against in our own countries. We demand the same rights afforded to immigrants and so called minorities!</p>

		<p>One useful tactic to display for the left-wing anti-White types is the example of East Asians. They are more succesful, as a group, in all the things that Whites supposedly have an unfair advantage through privilege. East Asians serve as a sort of control group. What&rsquo;s the excuse there, Asian privilege? The idea of a White supremacist society where another group, East Asians, is generally more successful and less likely to end up in prison, than Whites, is a rather contradictory concept.</p>

<p>https://news.change.org/stories/alabama-house-passes-apology-for-recy-taylors-jim-crow-era-gang-rape </p>
<p>Re Nathan McCall, his victims, Recy Taylor, and the old white rapist:     What is my goal/point ?</p>
<p>To put McCall in prison ?  No.   <br>
Though that is where he deserves to be.  <br>
    <br>
I am exposing the  ongoing prevalent   anti white man double standard &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo;  mindset of liberals-feminist and &ldquo;black power&rdquo; blacks. <br>
   <br>
Some white men are evil.  Precisely same as some blacks and some women are evil.   Same mixtures of good and evil in humans of all colors and both genders.   &ldquo;all have sinned.&rdquo;  <br>
 <br>
The significance-&ldquo;evilness&rdquo; of a crime does not change according to the race or gender or world status of the perp and victim.    </p>
<p>Recy Taylor is a black woman gang raped in 1944.  <br>
Rapist not punished due their being white and &ldquo;connected&rdquo; <br>
to the local white power structure.  67 years later, Recy Taylor&rsquo;s case  [and the many white on black rapes of the past] is significant to  the liberals-feminist and black power blacks.   </p>
<p>They sympatheticly supported research into Recy Taylor&rsquo;s life.   They publicized and  pressured government to grant her a public state  apology for failing to punish the rapist.  In 2011 she finally received &ldquo;offical&rdquo; state apology and widespread sympathetic  media attention.   </p>
<p>At least one book written about the Recy Taylor case and other cases of white on black rape.  <br>
 <br>
The liberals-feminist and black power blacks faction hasn&rsquo;t paid much attention to the ongoing growth in % of black on whites rapes.  However, recent cases in Cleveland Tx and Moreno Valley Ca have been noticed and may lead to some liberals-feminist and black power blacks paying at least some more  attention to the ongoing black rapist growth rates.   </p>
<p>Currently,  white rapes black is very rare.  Black rapes white is common.   Same with assults/mugging. </p>
<p>Many curious about the one still living white gang rapist of  Recey Taylor.    He is deemed a terrible human being. Despite his age,  some would have him arrested and indicted and convicted and punished today.  He certainly would not be allowed to peacefully be in a prestigious hi profile job/position such as being a university professor. </p>
<p>In 1994,  in MAKES ME WANNA HOLLER,  Nathan McCall publicly revealed his personal participation in &ldquo;many&rdquo; planned gang rapes of black women and girls [one 13 yr old specified.]    <br>
McCall reveals that he and his gang   &ldquo;perfected the art of luring babes into these traps.&rdquo;  <br>
McCall claims there were other gangs of young blacks doing same.    <br>
McCall&rsquo;s book was widely reviewed.  Currently 166 customer reviews,  so one can learn the gist of the book for free.    </p>
<p>The Amazon site claims the book was a best seller.  <br>
All connected to McCall must know he participated in many gang rapes,  for which he was never punished by the state.<br>
 <br>
McCall reveals that some victims sought justice.    <br>
McCall reveals the police and courts commonly believed false denials of the perps over the true word of the victims.    McCall himself and his gang was never even indicted.   </p>
<p>McCall&rsquo;s participation in gang rape was during the 1970s.  Approx 30-40 years ago. </p>
<p>McCall&rsquo;s MANY gang rape victims are currently uncared for.  <br>
No one cares to find them and offer condolence or sympathy or inquire as to how they are doing.  </p>
<p>No one cares how being gang raped affected their lives.    <br>
No one cares that they receive justice.  As far as I know,    McCall publicly has not expressed any remorse or shame. <br>
Nor has he sought to find and  apologize to any of his many victims.    If anyone knows of  McCall having made any public expression of remorse for his publicly revealed crimes,  or of his seeking to apologize to any of his victims,  please let me know.    </p>
<p>Victims also including the many whites that McCall&rsquo;s gang sought out and severly beat.  McCall plainly reveals his gangs common practice of attacking lone white boys. &#8220;just for being white&#8221; </p>
<p>Nathan McCall is now a professor at Emory university. <br>
     <br>
Everyone is content that  an unpunished black gang rapist be a respected professor at a prestigious university.    <br>
Everyone  including those so sympathetic to the black victim of an unpunished white rapist, in regard to a gang rape of 67 years ago.   <br>
   <br>
I am pointing out the ONGOING double standard of media/&rdquo;intellectuals&rdquo;/&rdquo;elites which is revealed in the stark difference in the way the victims of McCall are ignored while victim Recy Taylor is given considerable attention.</p>
<p>I am pointing out the ONGOING double standard of media/&rdquo;intellectuals&rdquo;/&rdquo;elites which is revealed in the stark difference in the way the unpunished old white rapist is vilified while black Nathan McCall is allowed to live &ldquo;the good life&rdquo; of an &ldquo;intellectual elite.&rdquo;     </p>
<p>In the case of McCall,   the same people who vilify the old white act as if McCall&rsquo;s  participation in MANY gang rapes <br>
is of no concern. As a matter of fact, writing a &ldquo;best seller&rdquo;  about his crimes is probably his single most significant achievement  that opened doors leading to his being a professor at Emory. </p>
<p>If McCall were white,  the liberal-feminist-black power types would petition for his crucifixion. <br>
  <br>
I point out that one color of gang rapist is respected, <br>
and the other color of gang rapist is vilified.     </p>
<p>Whether or not the double standard faction decides to become consistent is not my concern.     <br>
But as long as they remain inconsistent,  I will continue to point out the inconsistency/double standard. <br>

We whites demand the right granted to all humans to preserve our ethnic identity. All peoples have an innate preferences for their own kind and prejudices against outgroups&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Well said! This is the problem though; we&rsquo;re not even getting to control our own narrative on the stage that matters most.<br>
This framing of our message, others speaking for us and simply labeling us, is blatant defamation and is a deliberate misdirection which only makes our job of awakening other Whites that much harder, while already the numbers are not in our favor.</p>
<p>As elegant a speaker Mr. Taylor is, he almost always gets to deliver his very reasonable message under the White Supremacist headline.<br>
Which instantly tells all listeners/readers, hey these idiots (no offense and I mean this constructively) think they&rsquo;re the master race and (again) arrogantly or ignorantly think it&rsquo;s their birth right is a rule all others.</p>
<p>I believe that it is possible to find positive rhetoric for our pro White agenda which is universal and that is immune to Marxist critical theory, along the lines of &ldquo;I have a dream&hellip;&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t mean to plagiarize &lsquo;the plagiarist&rsquo;). </p>
<p>We need to keep it simple and try not to encroach on the rights of others when doing it. It&rsquo;s also my personal belief that we stay away from runic symbols, Teutonic strength and all that &lsquo;14 words&rsquo;, blood and soil sort of speech. Although this is genuinely part of (some of) our heritage, it does us no favors marketing and PR wise in the long run. Look at how much trouble Nick Griffin has had trying to distance himself from some of his &lsquo;youthful&rsquo; connections.</p>
<p>We really need a new wave of White nationalists cut from a similar cloth as &lsquo;Youth for a Western Civilization&rsquo; or even the SD, Swedish democrats party. Young, clean cut, well spoken and educated. Hey I&rsquo;m not saying that we disconnection from the elders of our tribe, by no means, we just need to be reinvented a little bit for the current age.<br>
This is where I think that young White liberals are really behind the times, their place on the other side of this battle expired decades ago, now they&rsquo;re really just fighting for their own displacement.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for Amren&rsquo;s official position, but the way I see it, ours is a civil rights position not unlike that of the &lsquo;other side&rsquo;s&rsquo; in the 1960&rsquo;s. <br>
Preservation and recognition as a group outside of the repressor role should be our goals. </p>
<p>Look at what this anti White privilege group is about, they&rsquo;re on a witch hunt looking for the last invisible bonds they may connect us White people. This is the final fig leaf. <br>
White institutional legislations, constitutions and curriculums were subverted a long time ago. The final frontier is in the fertile young minds of the next generation of Whites. <br>
Why do you think Tim &ldquo;die old White people die&rdquo; Wise, is a foundation member of this group?<br>
To quote three note worthy socialist leaders of the past&hellip;<br>
-&ldquo;Give me just one generation of youth, and I&rsquo;ll transform the whole world.&rdquo;<br>
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin<br>
-&ldquo;The basic clay of our work is the youth; we place our hope in it and prepare it to take the banner from our hands.&rdquo;<br>
Che Guevara<br>
-&ldquo;He alone, who owns the youth, gains the future.&rdquo;<br>
Adolf Hitler<br>
I think it was the regular poster Tim in Indiana, who shared the anecdote on how he and the rest of the returning adult university students in his class, where forcefully segregated by security guards from fraternizing with the rest of the student body, as to deny the seasoned and cynical the chance of tainting those impressionable young minds.</p>
<p>How the heck did we get in this position? </p>
<p>This &lsquo;White privilege&rsquo; concept boils down to being a whiny crutch for the weak willed.<br>
In this running race of life, black people want a two minute head start and White people to only use one leg.</p>
<p>These people are implying that with all other variables being equal such as family support, financial background, attractiveness, intelligence, communication skills and dependability/trustworthiness (I&rsquo;m sure there are many more variables), that evil Whitey still has the advantage. </p>
<p>But when are all of these other variables in this scenario are equal, who do you think in the current political climate would get the job really?</p>
<p>A society that operates with true equality would not be actively discriminating against one demographic within the populace alone to boost another. <br>
As other posters have said before these social engineers don&rsquo;t care about equal returns on equal investments, all they care about is the equal outcomes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no focus on Hispanic privilege and the death grip that they enjoy in the lawn care and day laborer industries, because there is no money in it.</p>
<p>With all of this White privilege, somehow southern and east Asians have managed to find their way around this evil invisible White wall.<br>
What was the conclusion that SPLC proponent on the &lsquo;Let Your Voice Be Heard&rsquo; forum came to the other week for Asian over achievement vs black under achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asians invest disproportionate effort to overcompensate&rdquo;.<br>
Translation: blacks are lazy (in liberal speak, de motivated, suppressed), Whites work just the right amount (because we know better than everybody else&hellip;remember this came from a lefty) and Asians work just too darn hard. <br>
Well I thought to myself welcome to Amren, &ldquo;one of us, one of us&rdquo;. <br>
Again they&rsquo;re highlighting the undeniable racial hierarchy of black, White and Asian, the only difference being how the left diagnosis&rsquo;s the root of the problem.</p>
<p>If White privilege comes from the fact that our countries were made by White people for White peoples sensibilities, perhaps like the remedy suggested for Western schools that are accused of being &#8216;too Eurocentric&rsquo; (apparently as are our countries) for African Americans, an Afro centric equivalent to this society would be the solution. <br>
But of course we&rsquo;d have to wait for the blacks and liberals to suggest it, as the subject of apartheid and segregation, even self segregation are taboo subjects for us now.</p>
<p>If we separated, then our differences would become evident. So like formal testing in schools and for various jobs, this would only highlight or concentrate our differences, which our leaders wish to deny exist.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see why it&rsquo;s difficult for you, John. You continually feed their guilt by quoting from such anti-white authors as the sick, self-hating white man, John Howard Griffin.<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
You do not advance your point of view by accusing those who disagree with you of being &#8220;self-hating&#8221; whites. I read Black Like Me years ago, but I do not remember John Howard Griffin expressing hatred for whites. Also, the book was published in 1961. Back then perfectly respectable, law abiding blacks in the South were denied basic rights, including the right to vote. <br>
 <br>
Since then they have been granted these rights. Attitudes that made sense then no longer do. </p>

Was your post even necessary? Just to state that you are a lesbian? Your comment has nothing to do with the subject and it is too bad that you cannot or will not change.</p>
<p>********************<br>
It may have nothing to do with the subject, but you should have asked that of olewhitelady, who brought up the subject in the first place. (It&rsquo;s one of her obsessions.)<br>
The above poster was just replying to it.<br>

<p>I have noticed that about olewhitelady, but never the less, I have every right to question the lesbian who just HAD to respond and say she will NEVER change. Homosexuals have a tendency to scour forums looking for the first opportunity to post their nonsense. Okay? </p>
<p>BTW, I have commented on a few of olewhitelady comments that were never posted.</p>

<p>Olewhitelady loses no opportunity to post her &#8220;nonsense&#8221; (to borrow your own term), which is her right &hellip;  just as it is any one else&rsquo;s right to respond to that, uh,  &#8220;nonsense&#8221;.</p>
<p>And incidentally, Olewhitelady was &#8220;the first&#8221; to hurl the insult, not our lesbian poster who merely  RESPONDED.<br>
And how do YOU  know what &#8220;tendencies&#8221; homosexuals have? What makes you an expert?</p>
<p>Btw, how did you manage to comment on her comments that were never posted.  Amazing!</p>
<p>PS.  I am not a Lesbian, but fair is fair. Anyone who is attacked has the right to respond. That&rsquo;s only reasonable.</p>
