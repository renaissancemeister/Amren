			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Celeste Katz, Daily News (New York), April 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An incensed federal judge sentenced a racist Brooklyn woman to indefinite jury duty on Tuesday after she trashed the NYPD and minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an outrage, and so are you!&#8221; Federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis told the woman, holding up her bile-filled juror questionnaire.</p>
<p>Juror No. 799, an Asian woman in her 20s who said she works in the garment industry, was up for jury duty in the death penalty trial of Bonanno crime boss Vincent (Vinny Gorgeous) Basciano.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for her to start looking worse than the defendant. Asked to name three people she least admired, she wrote on her questionnaire: &#8220;African-Americans, Hispanics and Haitians.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the judge asked why she answered the question that way, she replied, &#8220;You always hear about them in the news doing something.&#8221; She also declared that cops are all lazy, claiming that they sound their sirens to bypass traffic jams.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Taryn Merkl requested that the woman be disqualified from the Vinny Gorgeous case because of her &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; comments. The motion was granted.</p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Indeed, the woman was going to be seeing a lot of Brooklyn Federal Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s coming back [today], Thursday and Friday  &mdash;  and until the future, when I am ready to dismiss her,&#8221; Garaufis said.</p>

		<p> I admire this lady for her guts   &mdash;   she may have been just trying to get out of jury duty, but she may have really felt that way and just said it. But judges think they&rsquo;re God Almighty in their courtrooms, and it usually doesn&rsquo;t pay to flip them the bird, so to speak, when you&rsquo;re on their turf.</p>
<p> However, I&rsquo;d say this judge, who is obviously just indulging a fit of pique over someone&rsquo;s not kow-towing deeply enough to him, has placed himself in an awkward position, legally, if she wants to see a lawyer about the &#8220;punishment&#8221; he so cavalierly meted out to her. </p>

		<p>So now a juror cannot tell the truth? Racist? So what? So are those groups she listed. Like blacks, hispanics and haitians aren&rsquo;t racists?</p>
<p> The day is soon coming because of our inactions that a mainly White parent will have their children removed from the home if they dare say anything about what race their child will marry/date. We will have to &#8220;feel&#8221; and &#8220;think&#8221; what the authorities tells us to feel/think. How did we, White Americans, allow our country to sink to this insane level?</p>

<p>You gotta love the judgmental pseudo-journalism as well.</p>
<p>Too bad for them the woman wasn&rsquo;t white.  She would have gotten a pass for being black or Hispanic, but not Asian.</p>
<p>She is being punished for telling the truth by the thought police.  Even the lawyers had no basis for disqualifying her.<br>

Incidentally, I knew a Mexican acquaintance, some years ago, who had become a US  citizen.  He was full of contempt for the way the justice system here coddles criminals. When he was called for jury duty, he bluntly said that he didn&rsquo;t believe in the system and that as far as he was concerned they  (criminals) should all be taken out back and shot, and their organs harvested with no further ado.  </p>
<p>He was dismissed  from serving!  Just what he wanted.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a typical leftist moron of the highest order, and like most ALL leftist judges he should have a job at the car wash, not the courtroom for which he is dismally unqualified.</p>

		<p>This judge needs to think things through a little better.  If he puts her through perpetual jury duty, she will inevitably sit on juries with black American, Haitian and Hispanic defendants.  Therefore, any guilty verdict rendered while she, as an admitted &#8220;hater&#8221; of all those racial groups, can be overturned in the higher levels of the judiciary.</p>

<p>This woman is actually being penalized for her OPINION!  I know it has happened to high-profile people  &mdash;  they lose jobs, or their reputation is tainted.  But this is an anonymous citizen.<br>
She&rsquo;ll be receiving slave wages during jury duty, she&rsquo;ll most likely be deprived of her regular income  &mdash;  for who knows how long. Has it really come down to this? <br>
&#8220;Upset&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe my feelings after reading this story.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it works in NY, but in my OH county, if someone is chosen for possible jury duty, he remains eligible for three months.  Judges can&rsquo;t behave like potentates and demand audiences at their own whim.<br>
Of course, lawyers will routinely dismiss this woman because of her &#8220;prejudices&#8221;.  Hopefully, she needs the jury-duty allowance and will come out a winner in the end! </p>

		<p>This will backfire on them.  I, as a white person, can lie about my feelings so I get on.  If the defendant is black or hispanic, my &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; is still there and it will be an issue when I am deliberating a verdict on him.  </p>

But I would think most would be sneaky about their feelings.  This fool is way out there.  I live in NYC and didn&rsquo;t know about this till reading it here.  Let me tell you, if the juror was white the whole country would have heard about it by now.  </p>

<i>This is disturbing on so many levels that I don&rsquo;t even know where to start. Can a judge actually do this?</i></p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>Where in America do Americans have the right of free speech? I know the Constitution says &#8220;Congress shall make no law &hellip; abridging the freedom of speech&#8221; but WHAT does that mean?</p>
<p>So long as CONGRESS doesn&rsquo;t explicitly write a law, the government and its agents CAN abridge freedom of speech and they can punish people without trials and juries?</p>
<p>This woman has to have grounds to challenge this court ruling. It is beyond absurd.</p>
<p>This judge has convicted and imposed punishment on a woman without trial or jury for expressing her opinions.</p>
<p>Is this woman to serve until she no longer believes in her heart and soul what she currently believes? How does one measure that?</p>
<p>As I said, beyond absurd.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t challenged or vacated, we are in serious trouble.<br>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t say she &#8220;hated&#8221; anybody.  And, her opinion was based on the irrefutable fact that the people she named are in the news &#8220;doing something,&#8221; meaning doing something wrong.</p>

		<p>It could be worse. (In Boston a judge has refused to accept documents proving that a woman&rsquo;s cat is unable to perform jury duty, despite a letter from a veterinarian and a picture of said animal, proving that he is a genuine feline.) It all goes to show that most judges have their heads up their backsides most of the time. The woman mentioned here has a good and compelling argument for bringing suit against the judge and the court, so it is quite likely that not wanting to be sued, a higher court will overturn this very quickly.</p>

		<p>Judge Garaufis was in the news only a few months ago.</p>
<p>NYT (21 Jan 11): &#8220;A federal judge on Thursday ordered the City of New York to remedy years of discriminatory hiring in the Fire Department by giving hundreds of black and Latino applicants jobs, along with years of retroactive pay, and offering thousands of others some damages. The judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, said the city needed to compensate minority applicants who took discriminatory entrance exams, which were used from 1999 to 2002. He also said the city must overhaul how it hires new firefighters.  Judge Garaufis said that the roughly 7,400 minority applicants who took the tests in question should be able to apply for compensation from the city. Of that group, 293 applicants would be given priority hiring status and retroactive seniority.  The judge said the city should take immediate action, but the city, which has denied discriminating against minority applicants, has said it plans to appeal the order.  That makes it unclear just how soon the minority candidates might be hired. The judge said that out of every five entry-level hires, the Fire Department must agree to reserve two hires for black priority applicants and one for a Hispanic priority applicant until 293 qualifying minority candidates have been offered a position.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The judge is a Federal Judge sitting for life (actually the Constitution says &#8220;for a term of good behavior; in practice for life).  There is no disciplinary action for Federal Judges that I am aware of.  The only adverse action possible against them is Impeachment in the House of Representatives, followed by trial in the Senate.  Unlikely in the extreme that the House would vote to Impeach him; impossible that the Senate would remove him from the bench&hellip;</p>

		<p>Several years ago I was called for Jury Duty involving the case of a 22 year old black man beating and robbing a 78 year old female.<br>
When asked by the lawyers how I felt about the case I replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel everyone deserves a fair hearing and I will be glad to listen to all the facts before I find this gentleman guilty as charged&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason I was not selected to be on the jury.</p>
<p>Regarding the woman in the story, IF she is forced to serve to this degree my guess is anytime she feels the plaintiff is guilty IF he or she is a person of color that decision on her part will be labeled RACIST ?</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he made it clear it wasn&rsquo;t her views that angered him but what he said was her obvious attempt to weasel out of jury duty by lying.</p>
<p>&#8220;My ruling was not based in any way upon whether or not you held any racist views. It was apparent you did not tell the truth,&#8221; Garaufis told the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were the only juror who indicated that you had every form of bias imaginable. You were lying to the court in order to be excused.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jury questionaires are filled out under oath.</p>

My guess is this biased,activist judge would have responded in the same way if she had stated on her questionare the 3 people she admired the least was obama,vincente fox,jean-bertrand aristide..obviously the u.s. attorney who would be a part of prosecuting bonanno crime boss vincent basciano had an interest in seeing this potential jurist stricten  from the list for her statement concerning lazy police who turn on their sirens to run through traffic jams  &mdash;  which understandibly  raises a red flag concerning how she might perceive the rule of law overall,and how that might affect her ability to judge without prejudice,whether that be favorable to the one being tried or favorable to the prosecution&hellip;.my beef is with the judge in this circumstance and in paticular the questionaire itself.If i  was faced with such a question  i  would simply state NOYB..or perhaps,I plead the fifth..this  activist judge should be fired.It is outrageous that anyone who is called in to be a potential juror is punished in anyway for what they say on a questionare or in front of a  judge &amp; assistant attorney whose job it is to only decide what potential jurors will be sitting on the case.How does a judge decide whether someone is lying or not to get out of a case..and to serve punishment without ever being tried? Activist judges have hi-jacked our constitution and have made the rule of law an embarrassment which through the years has lost the respect of most Americans. </p>

		<p>&#8220;He landed on the page where she had said she had a relative who was a member of the Chinese Ghost Shadows gang in the 1980s, convicted of murder and still in prison.</p>
<p>&#8216;Why didn&rsquo;t you put &#8216;Asians&rsquo; down also?&rsquo; the judge asked sarcastically, referring to her list of least-liked people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Maybe I should have,&rsquo; she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>This made my day.</p>
<p>My hat goes off for this lady.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Asked to name three people she least admired, she wrote on her questionnaire: &#8216;African-Americans, Hispanics and Haitians.&rsquo;&#8221;  </p>
<p>1) Clearly the juror provided what she considered an honest answer.</p>
<p>2) No hatred expressed, the question was to name three people she least admired.  Granted these are groups and not people, but it was in response to least admired.  </p>
<p>3) One could claim racism.  But even if true, isn&rsquo;t that important information in juror selection?  Conversely, would the judge prefer to select jurors who are biased but be lied to about their prejudices? <br>
 <br>
4) Curious how the judge uses official position to punish a juror who practices freedom of expression in obeying judicial orders to answer a questionnaire.  Too bad the answers offend the judge&rsquo;s sensibilities. </p>
<p>5) It would be a scandal of national proportions if a black person was punished for stating essentially the same thing (of course substituting whites for Afro-Americans). </p>

		<p>If she had the time, it would be an interesting gambit to not show up for jury duty, thereby defying the predudical judges order.  Then he has a choice, escalate and risk increased media exposure or get stuffed.  Unfortunately it seems this judge is less than rational and punitive to those that challenge him.  Disgraceful at best, unconstitutional at worst.  And where is the judicial review board? </p>

		<p>Obviously, having an opinion is now a criminal offense here in the land of Marx and Engels. To paraphrase Jack Nicholson in &#8220;A Few Good Men&#8221;, they can&rsquo;t handle the truth. </p>
<p>Maybe this is what we need to do. Instead of being honest about how we feel, which apparently no one cares about, or really wants to hear it, perhaps we should be less than candid about how we feel, and then get on the Juries, and start handing out real Justice, which is long overdue in this Country. </p>

		<p> I witnessed something very similar and logically truthful expressed by a potential Oriental-Asian/American in Newark, N.Y.&rsquo;s Essex County Court House for the purpose of selecting 24 potential jurors from approximate pool called together that morning&rsquo;s jury pool. We had a young black woman judge with letters received days/ weeks earlier from some pool jurors why they shouldn&rsquo;t serve on this particular Federal Grand Jury session. The black judge cross examined their verbal excuse with their corresponding written letter stating the same argument against serving.  When this small, elderly Asian shopkeeper stated his reason(s) of numbers robberies and beatings at the hands of black thugs over the years with anger; the black judge curtly and politely said to this man, &#8221; you&rsquo;re dismissed &#8221; ! I thought, typical reality of living and or working in a black city for anyone including this recent immigrant, ( he had a thick Asian accent on his English ).</p>
