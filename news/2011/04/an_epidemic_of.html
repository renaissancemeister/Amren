<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/opinion/04mon2.html?_r=3&amp;emc=eta1">An Epidemic of Rape for Haiti&rsquo;s Displaced</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Times, April 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Life after Haiti&rsquo;s earthquake has been especially difficult and dangerous for displaced women and girls. In addition to the ongoing crises of homelessness and cholera, a chronic emergency of sexual violence prevails in the settlements where hundreds of thousands still live, well over a year after the disaster.</p>
<p>Groups of Haitian women have been struggling to defend themselves, banding together to prevent assaults and now taking their case to a wider world. At a hearing March 25 in Washington before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a grass-roots group, Kofaviv, joined other human-rights advocates in pressing for an end to what they called a rape epidemic. The police, they said, rarely patrol inside unlighted camps or investigate attacks. Victims live in constant fear and shame while attackers go unpunished.</p>
<p>Their evidence, compiled in a wrenching petition delivered to the commission last fall, led the commission to demand urgent action by Haiti to protect its women and girls. The Haitian government, beset by political and other crises, has failed to do its job. But others, including the United Nations, the United States and other international donors and aid agencies, can and must do more.</p>

		<p>Those who pretend to believe that the races are equal in terms of innate moral qualities will no doubt mention the comfort women used by Japanese soldiers and sailors during World War II, and the Rape of Nanking.<br>
 <br>
Atrocities by the Japanese military were out of character for the Japanese nation, which has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. <br>
<a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_mur_percap-crime-murders-per-capita" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_mur_percap-crime-murders-per-capita</a><br>
 <br>
Those atrocities were also out of character for the Japanese military in earlier wars. <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
Unlike many other major powers, Japan had not signed the Geneva Convention (1929) &mdash; also known as The Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Geneva July 27, 1929 &mdash; which was the version of the Geneva Convention that covered the treatment of prisoners of war during World War II.[19] Nevertheless, an Imperial Proclamation (1894) stated that Japanese soldiers should make every effort to win the war without violating international law. According to historian Yuki Tanaka, Japanese forces during the First Sino-Japanese War, released 1,790 Chinese prisoners without harm, once they signed an agreement not to take up arms against Japan again.[20] After the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), all 79,367 Russian Empire prisoners were released, and were paid for labour performed, in accordance with the Hague Convention.[20] Similarly the behaviour of the Japanese military in World War I (1914–18) was at least as humane as that of other militaries,[citation needed] with some German POWs of the Japanese finding life in Japan so agreeable that they stayed and settled in Japan after the war.[21][22]</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to be suspicous that AmRen might harbor a lingering and unconfessed racial bias against blacks.</p>
<p>Anyone who compares the lack of crime in Japan with the horror of Haiti is obviously unshy about promoting prejucide against blacks.  </p>
<p>If you mention stereotypes about blacks as being more prone to crime than other groups, you are fostering and spreading virulent bigotry and toxic racism.</p>
<p>You also are speaking the truth.  AmRen deserves a Human Rights award for creating a venue where suspicion-minded Whites can go and see stories that confirm our prejudices, nurture our prejudices, and grow our prejudices into strong survival techniques. </p>
<p>As the White Nurse said who went to work at the urban hospital: &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t a raciss before I came to work here.&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>Life after Haiti&rsquo;s earthquake has been especially difficult and dangerous for displaced women and girls. </i></p>
<p>The moment you see the phrase &#8220;women and girls&#8221; you should consider this as feminist propaganda. These are usually code words for playing the female-as-victim-male-as-victimizer card. Note that the victimization of men and boys by any amount of violence or female manipulations foes unmentioned. I say this not to dispute AR&rsquo;s point in posting this (about the rates of violence in Haiti [low IQ] versus Japan [high IQ]). Rather, it it to point out that this sort of article can be one more front in the PC agitprop machine. No doubt if confronted with these realities, the multicultists will blame it all on White male imperialism. <br>

		<p>Apparently first-world do-gooders have orchestrated this whole protest.  Haiti&rsquo;s poor have long lived in unsafe conditions, in housing where anyone could just barge in.  Just as in SA and most other black-majority nations, rape is rampant.</p>

<p> Soon we&rsquo;ll be hearing the old &#8220;we just can&rsquo;t sit back and allow this to go on&#8221;. Do I smell asylum of rape victims to the United States? Every woman in Haiti will suddenly become a &#8220;rape victim&#8221; and once here will send for their families to join them. We are such fools!!!<br>

<p>This has likely been going on since before the quake but it was kept quiet because nobody in the press wanted to stereotype blacks as violent rapists. As a result, the problem has exploded and can not be brought under control and can no longer be hidden, especially to the aid workers who are stunned by the level of brutality and are likely texting and twittering their fingers off.<br>

		<p>I believe the Haitian men always raped women and girls that is why so many children were placed in orphanages.Now that disorganization continues,it creates more opportunity for these animals.First things first,rebuild jails,train and arm a force of women who would patrol settlements.</p>

		<p>Well, some questions present themselves. First, why is this somehow our responsibility? Second, did a bunch of nice young men suddenly turn into rapists after the earthquake?  Who did these rapists get their moral guidance from?  Aren&rsquo;t most children in Haiti raised by women?</p>

		<p>If the women are dependent on the men for &#8216;gifts&rsquo; of money or food in trade for sex and cooking, that means there can be no hard-interface barrier because it is in the interests of at least some of the women to invite the men in.</p>
<p>If you install a (gender segregated camp structure) barrier which imposes a -time- constraint for the number of minutes/seconds that a nominally stronger invader has to expose themselves while negotiating their way across/thru/around the obstacle or traffic choke, even simple (standoff) weapons like broom handles and kitchen implements become effective defensive tools because the invader cannot both protect themselves and traverse the wall, ropelines, staked ditch or foottrap holes.</p>
<p>i.e.  If these women wanted a secure environment, they could make it happen.  Simply, quickly and easily.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.  Because what isn&rsquo;t being said is that the rape is probably at least partially a mechanism for barter trade and the women may also lack the conceptual ability to organize armed, militant, patrols to secure their own encampment.</p>
<p>We have to stop looking at the rest of the world as though from an ivory tower position of ethical horror at what would violate our own moral rectitude.</p>
<p>Only then will we be able to avoid being suckered by every victim speech as agitprop.</p>

		<p>Here is how a liberal would solve the problem: open up our borders to Haitians as a whole and we can lift them up and compensate them for all the white oppression heaped upon them, even though they&rsquo;ve been independent for 200 years.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mention stereotypes about blacks as being more prone to crime than other groups, you are fostering and spreading virulent bigotry and toxic racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mentioning stereotypes don&rsquo;t foster anything. Realities foster stereotypes. There are many stereotypes like women being shorter than men. That is a stereotype. That can &#8220;foster&#8221; &#8220;prejudice and sexism.&#8221; Or maybe these are underlying realities that people see in the world. There are exceptions to the rule and some women are taller than men.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&hellip;prejudices into strong survival techniques.&#8221;</p>
<p>This hits it. It has to do with survival. That is way we categorize and label.</p>
<p>Not all sharks eat people. But do you want to swim with them?</p>
