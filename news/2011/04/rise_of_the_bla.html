<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Americans have had a curious fascination with serial killers, since the days Jack the Ripper prowled the streets of London. {snip}</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with how the story goes. Intelligent middle class white loner, abused as a youth, a bed-wetter until puberty with a morbid fascination of torturing animals as a teen, snaps and begins killing people as an adult. The names and stories of Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Robert Lee Yates and dozens of others fit this description and seem make this idea credible. Turn on the television or read a fiction book about serial killers and this is the idea portrayed, in nearly every instance, serial killers are always white. But is this always correct? The answer is resoundingly, no!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2002 a scene in Washington D.C. and surrounding areas played out over a three week period, as the Beltway Sniper kept the nation on it&rsquo;s toes. In initial reports, authorities were on the lookout for a white male in his mid-thirties, possibly driving a white mini-van. FBI profilers and sketch artists told the masses what this white killer possibly looked like, and what behavior this individual exhibited. Area citizens were on the lookout for anyone fitting this description, as dozens that fit were interviewed. The nation did a double take once the captured killer, with gun in hand turned out to be a Black Muslim that went by the name John Allen Muhammad.</p>
<p>Soon following every black commentator that could be found was on the news media, showing their dismay at the thought of a black killer. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Admittedly, my perception at the time was skewed as well. Aside from what I vaguely remembered from of Wayne Williams, the black serial killer from Atlanta in the late 70&rsquo;s; I assumed black serial killers weren&rsquo;t common. In the numerous books I&rsquo;d read on the subject, from understanding the psychology behind a sociopath to the fine details of their horrible crimes; Williams was usually the lone black killer in their lists. I assumed, that if black serial killers existed, surely the information would be in print.</p>
<p><b>The Facts</b></p>
<p>{snip} What I found not only proved conclusively black serial killers do exist, but of the blatant bias against reporting on them.</p>
<p>At first I thought I&rsquo;d be lucky to find twenty. Once I eclipsed this mark, I raised the bar to fifty black serial killers, thinking that had to be the ceiling. When my list eclipsed two hundred and counting, I realized this topic is the most ignored subject involving blacks in American history. Every generation from the reconstruction, to present is rife with examples.</p>
<p>To begin, the same criteria used by the FBI for serial killers has been followed. A serial killer is one that has killed at least twice, with a cooling period between each killing in which the murders were premeditated. Spree killers, mass murders, gang killings and hired assassins haven&rsquo;t been included in the data. {snip}</p>
<p>Currently the official list, of which every black serial killer&rsquo;s information and crimes has been confirmed, is sitting at 206 entries, with more than a dozen being investigated for possible addition. In just the first quarter of 2011, five that have been apprehended were added. {snip}</p>
<p>One common complaint that arises with the PC types when discussing black serial killers, if they admit they exist, is their constant insisting that these killers only account for a small portion of murders done by serial killers. Whites are to blame they maintain, blacks aren&rsquo;t possible of such wanton destruction. Again the data speaks another story.</p>
<p>Below is a chart from a class taught on the subject of serial killers. The left column represents the decade in which the crimes happened; to the right of this each race is represented. Since this chart was released in September 2010, new data has surfaced and will continue to surface for some time. An example is the decade of 2000-2010 saw 82 total serial killers of all races in this chart. In that decade alone, seven additional black serial killers have surfaced since this chart&rsquo;s publication, and are either awaiting trial or have recently been found guilty. This brings the tally up to 89 killers for that decade, which lowers the white serial killers to 36%, while raising blacks to 62%. In addition to this a few cold cases from earlier decades have been attributed to black serial killers. Another thing to note is the absence of Indian serial killers from this chart. While few in number, I suspect they&rsquo;ve been added to the category of white, which pads the whites numbers making them appear higher.</p>

<p>Historically from 1890 to present black serial killers have accounted for almost 26% of all solved murders from serial killers. In just the past three decades, the number rises drastically to 38.9%. This trend shows no sign of stopping anytime soon either. Estimates based solely off current trends, place the possible black serial killers for the decade we&rsquo;re in, at anywhere from 62.5% to 75% of all serial killers! {snip}</p>
<p>When crunching these statistics, an even more startling trend surfaces. Currently, blacks are a minority in this country and represent about 12.6% of our current population. Of this, black males represent 48% of this total, which equates 6% of the total U.S. population. But this figure represents males from birth to death; a more fine tuned number is in need. When black males from 18-44 are considered solely, it&rsquo;s found they make up only 38.6% of the previous 6%, or about 2.33% of the total U.S. population.</p>
<p>According to the current list, every black serial killer that has been apprehended is male (there is one instance of a female accomplice, forced to kill). Almost exclusively, they kill or begin their rampage between the ages of 18 and 44. So, the bottom line is a group that represents only 2.33% of the U.S. population has been responsible for producing serial killers responsible for over one quarter of the serial killings from 1890 to present. More shocking, this minority within a minority will committed almost a third of known serial killings in the past decade. {snip}</p>
<p><b>A Startling Trend</b></p>
<p>When trying to assess how the trend of black serial killers is on the rise, a of variety key factors come into play. Chief amongst these is the idea that serial killers are always white. Hollywood and popular shows such as Dexter tout this idea and portray serial killings as restricted to whites and on rare occasion Hispanics. Fictional books follow the same theme, without ever straying far from their politically correct course. When a black serial killer is caught, the media coverage is usually restricted to the local market in which they were apprehended. The bottom line is black serial killers don&rsquo;t draw the same attention as whites convicted of the same crime.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most everyone has heard of Jeffery Dahmer. {snip} Television documentaries and books gave the gruesome details of his beastly activity for years after his capture. Now twenty years later, his name still invokes fear and wretches stomachs.</p>
<p>While Dahmer&rsquo;s crimes horrified the nation, barely a decade later a serial killer stalked the streets of St. Louis, committing similar atrocities. He preyed on drug dependent black prostitute, which he took back to his home to be raped, tortured and killed. After his arrest, police found videotapes he&rsquo;d recorded of his crimes, labeling one of them &#8220;My Wedding Story&#8221;. In these tapes he forced his captives, which were bound with duct tape to submit to him as their lord and master, while he beat and abused them. Next he repeatedly raped them repeatedly with unusual and torturous foreign objects, he then strangled his victims to death. Forensic investigators noted there were multiple layers of blood sprayed onto the walls. After his capture, he confessed to 17 murders, yet evidence now points to at least 20. However, while police were still in their investigation he hung himself, so the true number may never be known. Despite the horrific nature of his crimes, nary an American has ever heard the name of Maury Troy Travis, primarily because he was black. Had he been white, his name would be as common as Dahmer in the minds of Americans. {snip}</p>
<p>The year 1987 found the capture of Gary Heidnik in Philadelphia, with a gruesome discovery in his basement that horrified the nation. His crime was kidnapping six black women, five of which he kept in his basement as sexual slaves and prisoners. Two died of starvation and trauma in the pits he&rsquo;d dug. His story made national news for weeks, the nation was outraged and blacks were calling for his swift execution for defiling black women. Even a movie character, Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs was based on his horrible story. While the nation was still reeling from Heidnik&rsquo;s story, one involving more victims and similar circumstances unfolded just six months later.</p>
<p>Just about three miles from Heidnik&rsquo;s homemade prison, a predator hunted the same streets where Gary had kidnapped his victims. This killer eventually nabbed eight black women over a one-year period and like his contemporary held his victims prisoner to rape and torture. This killer however, had a lust for blood and strangled each of his victims to death. After death, he performed necrophilia on their rotting corpses for weeks, and when the urge to kill again hit him, he stored the remains in a closet or bedroom with his other victims. {snip}</p>
<p>Closely coupled with the bias against reporting on black serial killers, is the fear that commentators or authors reporting on their crimes will be deemed racist, if they slip and call the killer a pejorative name. Sure it&rsquo;s okay to call Henry Lee Lucas, the guy that claimed to murder from 3 to 600 people a primitive monster. But should the same name be attached to Marc Sappington, a black serial killer appropriately nicknamed the Kansas City Vampire, blacks nationwide would be screaming for an apology to be issued. Some would stoop low enough to demand the killer&rsquo;s release as a form of reparations for daring to call a black a monster. An example of this was seen in 1993 after Colin Ferguson killed 6 and wounded 19 on a commuter train, in front of 40 plus witnesses. Thomas Gulotta referred to him as an animal for his barbaric crime. Jesse Jackson and crew immediately responded criticizing Gulotta&rsquo;s choice of words, fearing a race war would be started and blacks would be hunted down.  Even Ferguson&rsquo;s defense played on this, claiming the witnesses were racist and hated blacks.</p>
<p>{snip} When a black commits a violent crime against a white, the usual demagogues go to work spinning fanciful stories. They tell of how the poor deprived black man, in his lowly state rose up and smote the white man, showing he was an equal, no longer to be shackled or forced into servitude. They cry for his release, claiming that until America has reached a magical egalitarian utopia, this will continue to happen. Closely linked with this, the hip-hop music industry openly promotes and glorifies killing to a generation of young blacks. (Colorado Springs police trace rise in violence to gangster rap music) Charismatic rap stars unabashedly speak of killing whites, cops and raping white women. Meanwhile weak minded whites feel guilty for any racialist thought they&rsquo;ve ever entertained, and raise their children up to believe the lie that multiculturalism is successful.</p>
<p>This deadly combination of causal effects, pave a path of destruction for black males, as they seek honor and prestige in their communities. While most turn to just rape, robberies and gang violence, more and more are acquiring a taste for blood. As long as these dangerous trends continue, black serial killers will continue to grow more brazen as their ranks swell. {snip}<br>

		<p>And, they also are more likely to ignore the security cameras when they rob you local convenience store, because they know that the SPLC-ADL-NAACP Axis of Diversity will come to their rescue with tactics that no anti-racist White judge can ever withstand, and that every Affirmative Action judge embraces. </p>

		<p>I have known this for a long time, yet the media ALWAYS depicts them as mostly Whites. Also remember just because the most notorious serial killers have white skin does not mean they are of the White race. </p>
<p>Juan Corona, a Mexican, murdered more than any serial killer to date, if memory serves me right.</p>

		<p>I was living in the inner city when Jeffrey Dahmer made news, and police were &#8216;embarrassed&rsquo; for having failing to apprehended him for so long a period of time. As big as the news story for this serial killer was, I think all of the police felt a little embarrassed. After that, if ever police were on my property, for any reason, they always found a way or a reason to push inside my home, to make sure everything was alright, perhaps. </p>
<p>Oh, the racial stereotyping. Being white in a &#8216;transforming&rsquo; neighborhood isn&rsquo;t always great in other ways in regards to the police either. It&rsquo;s often assumed you may be there trying to buy drugs or visit prostitutes. No one is afraid to pull you over, either. No, they have the opposite concern. Always have.  </p>

		<p>This is useful to know.  After all, whenever someone brings up the much higher rate of violent crime among blacks compared to whites or Asians, somebody else invariably counters by saying that all the serial killers are white.  As I recall that happened in one of the television shows that Jared Taylor appeared on.</p>
<p>The next time that happens Jared can just rub their noses in the facts.<br>

<p>This was an excellent article, and the depraved multicultural/white guilt aspects are covered well enough so as to require no comment. However, it needs to be pointed out that because so many black serial killers prey on the undesirables (i.e, addicts, prostitutes, derelicts) in their &ldquo;communities,&rdquo; that this provides a certain amount of cover for them and the media. One is rarely surprised when a hooker or junkie turns up dead and not through natural causes; these are normal hazards of the &ldquo;job,&rdquo; so to speak. </p>
<p>This is not the case when a suburban soccer mom or cheerleader turns up dead and butchered. That makes a warning siren go off, that a disemboweled &ldquo;crack ho&rdquo; or pimp can never pull!</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!!!</p>

		<p>Most white serial killers prey on white victims, and most black serial killers prey on black victims. But when it comes to black on white or white on black serial killers, there are more black on white serial killers than the reverse.  Jeffrey Dahmer was the most famous white on black serial killer, but a black serial killer who preyed on white female victims didnt get 1% as much publicity as Dahmer did, and he killed possibly more than 80.  His name was Watts, you may have heard of him.  He died and went somewhere.  I can recall many other black on white serial killers,I dont have the time to mention any more of them.  There is a website about this subject, it is archemedesgaleli. Check it out.</p>

		<p>Interesting piece. I had always heard that black serial killers were rarer than white ones, but it now appears that, as with other black-committed crimes, their numbers were just underreported.</p>
<p>As far as serial killings needing to be premeditated, at least it shows that blacks are able to plan some things out in advance.</p>

<p>*** </p>
<p>As far as black serial killers in general, Jared Taylor has found the stat that of the universe of serial killers, the percentage of them that are black is about the same as the black percentage of the American population.  So they&rsquo;re about on proportion.  The only reason serial killing &#8220;seems&#8221; like a white crime is that it&rsquo;s one of the few violent crimes where blacks don&rsquo;t disproportionately commit it relative to their general population.</p>

		<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but Dhamer did not hang himself. He was murdered while in prison. Our opposition will pick at details, we must make certain all ours are correct. </p>
<p>Per Wikipedia:</p>
<p>On November 28, 1994, he was beaten to death by an inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution, where he had been incarcerated.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As far as black serial killers in general, Jared Taylor has found the stat that of the universe of serial killers, the percentage of them that are black is about the same as the black percentage of the American population. So they&rsquo;re about on proportion.&#8221;</p>
<p>See Here: </p>
<p>African Americans and Serial Killing in the Media<br>
The Myth and the Reality<br>
Anthony Walsh<br>
Boise State University</p>
<p><br>
In a sample of 413 serial killers operating in the United States from 1945 to mid-2004, it was found that 90 were African American. Relative to the African American proportion of the population across that time period, African Americans were overrepresented in the ranks of serial killers by a factor of about two. </p>

		<p>A search of the website NewNationNews has as one of its features a list of black serial killers also. Quite a few more than you would expect, unless you are enlightened enough to know that the usual news channels hide as much of black perpetrated crime as they can. Crime statistics are skewed from the local, state and federal levels. I know, I&rsquo;ve worked in law enforcement for three decades.</p>

		<p>The number of black-on-white serial killers has probably increased as blacks have become better able to move freely into white areas.  And many black-on-black serial murderers have probably come to wide public notice because liberal reporters were expecting the killer to be white  &mdash;  and then couldn&rsquo;t silence the news when it emerged that he&rsquo;s black.  There&rsquo;s also a general conspiracy to hide the fact that some of these murderers are homosexual.  The cops are probably even pressured to go easy on the gay community.  In Dahmer&rsquo;s case, one of the victims was even returned to him.</p>

If the numbers are correct, it seems to prove, once again, that as blacks take advantage of their choices in life, their dysfunction increases.</p>

&#8220;This is not the case when a suburban soccer mom or cheerleader turns up dead and butchered. That makes a warning siren go off, that a disemboweled &ldquo;crack ho&rdquo; or pimp can never pull!</p>

With all due respect, it&rsquo;s becoming apparent that God has stopped making the personal appearancs and Deus ex machina interventions that he so frequently did in the Old Testament. He was MIA when Channon and Christopher were being beaten, violated, mutilated and murdered, when the Wichita victims were being raped and murdered, when Amy Biehl (who was &#8220;doing the Lord&rsquo;s work&#8221; in SA) was pleading for her life while she was being stabbed while Bantu onlookers cheered, while Eve Carson was being shotgunned in the face. Need I go on? <br>
It&rsquo;s WE who need to take the steps necessary to put an end to the horror.  As Shakespeare said &#8220;Cry &#8216;Havoc,&rsquo; and let slip the dogs of war&#8221;. <br>
Instead of the Government waging this dirty war against the White population, they&rsquo;re presiding over the one being carried out by the vast Black underclass that they&rsquo;ve created with the compliance of the unjustified guilt ridden White people. <br>
As Sean Connery&rsquo;s character advised Elliot Ness, &#8220;If he puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one if HIS in the morgue&#8221;.  <br>

		<p>Thanks for re-posting this article, it&rsquo;s just a snippet of the research on this subject I&rsquo;ve been doing over the past many months. I&rsquo;ve begun writing a book presenting the stories of some of the killers, as well as providing the entire list (206 to date) of black serial killers.  Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll have the book finished in the next few months and ready for publication.  I&rsquo;ll keep you posted. </p>

		<p>Is this an actual change in behavior of blacks or a change in the idiotic assumptions made by &#8220;profilers&#8221;?    The dimbulbs at the FBI and Hollywood virtually had it written in stone since the &rsquo;70s that virtually all serial killers were white. </p>

		<p>Question Diversity: Thank you for this unfortunate list. It is disgusting and brutal, but it all sadly happened. I think one of the stereotypes that has backfired on liberals was the belief that a convincing majority of serial killers were Caucasian. This only led to the belief that it took planning, thinking, and decit to lure women into their webs (serial killer&rsquo;s realm). This by default proved the point that Whites had a higher IQ to be able to pull this&#8221;wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&#8221; persona off. So strangely, criminologists would refrain from calling a duck a duck. Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it? But with the world wide web, people can &#8220;google&#8221; anything and find out pieces of the truth and draw their own conclusions. It seems as if the blacks have taken the worst of White &#8220;uncivilization&#8221; &amp; ran with it.</p>

		<p>Fascinating that Rushton&rsquo;s pattern of Asian - White - Black are now emerging in a traditionally white dominated crime.</p>
<p>Also that there has been such a precipitous drop in the number of serial killers since the 1990&rsquo;s: less than 1/3 of what it was! </p>

		<p>Most of the nonsense presented on serial killers comes from the FBI&rsquo;s offender profiling research in the 1980s, which produced some very weak but influential research from their counsellors-turned-&#8216;profilers&rsquo; which only interviewed the few serial killers willing to be interviewed (35 to 42, i believe), and generalized from that.  No consideration of base-rates, sampling, or psychological measurement.  Of course, Quantico is as PC as they come, so would be quite able to put a telescope to their eye and say &#8220;I see no ships&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Poster #20. You hit on something that I&rsquo;ve believed for quite some time. That serial killers are a dying breed, no pun intended. And that&rsquo;s a good thing, no matter what race the killer is. But if these numbers are being manipulated by the far left to project an image of innocence among blacks, then it&rsquo;s all the more reason for White society to be skeptical. There was another cases in Cleveland two years ago where a black serial killer (Anthony Sowell) was charged with killing 11 black women who were crack addicts and hookers. </p>

		<p>Question Diversity: I am proud of you for having ran such a good website.

		<p>The early serial killer statistics showing a lower ratio of Black:White serial killers left me wondering if many early black serial killers were never apprehended or flew under the radar. If a street walker turned up dead in 1920s New Orleans it&rsquo;s like no one would notice. No DNA profiling, primitive forensic work, and so on, may have made a pattern of killings invisible. In fact, I just watched a Frontline documentary about incompetence and lack of facilities among county coroners across the USA. I can&rsquo;t imagine many county coroners in 1910 would have had better resources than they do now. My instinct tells me that Black serial killings were underreported in the past, and not just due to media protection of the sainted black. <br>
