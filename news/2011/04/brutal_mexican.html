			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Seper, Washington Times, April 19 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The signature crimes of the most violent drug cartel in Mexico are its beheading and dismemberment of rival gang members, military personnel, law enforcement officers and public officials, and the random kidnappings and killings of civilians who get caught in its butchery and bloodletting.</p>
<p>But this disparate band of criminals known as Los Zetas is no longer just a concern in Mexico. It has expanded its deadly operations across the southwestern border, establishing footholds and alliances in states from New York to California. Just last year, federal agents tied a cocaine operation in Baltimore to the Zetas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Trained as an elite band of Mexican anti-drug commandos, the Zetas evolved into mercenaries for the infamous Gulf Cartel, bringing a new wave of brutality to Mexico&rsquo;s escalating drug wars. Bolstered by an influx of assassins, bandits, thieves, thugs and corrupt federal, state and local police officers, the Zetas have since evolved into a well-financed and heavily armed drug smuggling force of their own.</p>
<p>Known for mounting the severed heads of their rivals on poles or hanging their dismembered bodies from bridges in cities throughout Mexico, the Zetas have easily become the most feared criminal gang in Mexico  &mdash;  where 35,000 people have been killed in a continuing drug war. Everyone is a potential victim: men, women and children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Grisly example</b></p>
<p>What the Zetas are capable of doing was never more clear than the carnage they left behind in December 2009 on a squalid back street in the border town of Reynosa, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas. The bodies were no longer human, their torsos scarred by deep lacerations and punctures; the severed heads were badly beaten. Crudely butchered limbs lay scattered across a blood-stained tarmac.</p>
<p>&#8220;See. Hear. Shut up, if you want to stay alive,&#8221; read a note written like so many others in block letters on blood-splattered poster board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Mexican authorities have unearthed more than 140 bodies from mass graves in the state of Tamaulipas. Many of the victims were kidnapped off buses and killed when they refused to work for the Zetas. Tamaulipas, in northeastern Mexico, is across the border from Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the beheadings and dismemberments are used to punish those who oppose or betray them, to establish turf, to terrorize the citizenry against testifying against them, and to press political leaders to collaborate, random killings also have become the gang&rsquo;s trademark  &mdash;  used by the Zetas, Mr. Grayson said, to demonstrate that no one is beyond their reach, that they can kidnap, torture and kill anyone they choose.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheriff Gonzalez said U.S. authorities on the border are outgunned and outmanned by drug smugglers armed with automatic weapons, grenades and state-of-the-art communications and tracking systems. He said drug profits have allowed the cartels, particularly the Zetas, to develop &#8220;experts&#8221; in explosives, wiretapping, countersurveillance, lock-picking and Global Positioning System technology.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sheriff Gonzalez said Middle Eastern terrorists brought the practice of beheading their enemies to Central America and later Mexico. He said it also has become a tactic of U.S. street gangs, including Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, which, according to the FBI, has now spread across 42 states, with active operations in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C., as well as California, Texas and New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Still expanding</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Homeland Security Department has said that Mexican drug cartels, including the Zetas, have infiltrated 276 U.S. cities and represent the nation&rsquo;s most serious organized-crime threat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Baltimore operation</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials, the Zetas also have reached across the Mexican border into Central America for new recruits, including former members of Los Kaibiles, an elite special operations force of the Guatemalan military trained in jungle warfare and counterinsurgency tactics.</p>
<p>Guatemalan officials said the Zetas have established bases in several jungle areas and formed alliances with Central American gangs to take control of cocaine shipments from Guatemala to Mexico. Other links have been forged between the Zetas and the Ndrangheta, one of Italy&rsquo;s most powerful crime syndicates that specializes in cocaine distribution and arms trafficking.</p>
<p>The Zetas also have pushed their way into legal and illegal businesses by killing, kidnapping or extorting those in control, a scheme known as &#8220;plata o plomo,&#8221; Spanish for &#8220;money or lead.&#8221; According to U.S. law enforcement and intelligence reports, they use their massive supply of weapons and high-tech equipment to instill fear to take over numerous businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Grayson said the Zetas use blatant violence to take over lesser-equipped criminal gangs and extortion to assume control of legitimate businesses. He said they extort business owners with threats of kidnapping family members &#8220;and think nothing of cutting them up if they don&rsquo;t get their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Zetas, seeking to grab a larger portion of the $25 billion cocaine, heroin and marijuana market in the United States, are estimated to have between 1,000 and 3,000 hard-core members and 10,000 loyalists across Mexico, Central America and the United States. Authorities said the gang has organized a sophisticated supply and distribution network operating through established territories.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Zetas are quite diversified and they are good bookkeepers,&#8221; Mr. Grayson said. &#8220;They will go where they can make money and will do what they have to do to make it happen.&#8221;<br>

		<p>So here is the larger point. Amnesty will result in huge voting block for open borders&hellip;.there will be a self-reinforcing process set into motion that will exponentially accelerate race-replacement. The violence of Mexico will flood into America&hellip;and this is just one country..it will flood in from other nonwhite  countries also. The violent gang-bangers from the various nonwhite nations will recieve free military training..paid for by Native Born White American taxpayers. If Native Born White Americans put their fate in the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites&hellip; Native Born White Americans will be finished&hellip;this is what  racial minority status within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221; will mean..with 100 percent certainty.</p>
<p>It is urgent that Native Born White American Patriots speak to their fellow Native Born White Americans about  really scary things like this:Ask them what they are willing to give up for racial minority status in the very future&hellip;do this incessantly.</p>
<p>The paradox in all of this is:as horrific as the passage of amnesty will be&hellip;if it ends up being passed in the next few years would it be the event that ignites a massive level of racial consciousness in millions of Native Born White Americans? If amnesty is inevitable, would it be better to have it now or when Native Born White Americans are a smaller percentage of the population in the future&hellip;.for surely, when Native Born White Americans are a smaller percentage of the &#8220;US&#8221; population in the future&hellip; Amnesty will pass with 100 percent certainty..it will be much more difficult to reverse the situation when nonwhites-like the violent gang-bangers mentioned in this article-are a majority in the &#8220;US&#8221; military.</p>
<p>Treason is the Reason&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t expect the media to report much on Mexican gang crime. If the mainstream becomes worried about it, then decent Whites won&rsquo;t be readily seduced by the diversity is our strength mandate and that we urgently need compassionate, comprehensive immigration reform that puts those undocumented workers who are just trying to help their families on a fast path to citizenship and the vote.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t the Zetas move their operations here?  Whitey America is the most gullible, generous, open, inclusive, welcoming society in the history of the universe.  Sounds ripe for the taking&hellip; look what we&rsquo;ve allowed and encouraged the blacks to do to us. That message goes around the world. That&rsquo;s why we have so much 3rd world immigration, legal and illegal.  Everybody knows that Whites are chump pushovers.</p>
<p>Accept the White Nurse Syndrome as a healing restoration: transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip; &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t a raciss until I started working here.&#8221;<br>

<p> Do you think for a minute that most Whites in this country have ever even heard of these Zetas, let alone WATCHED the horrific acts they have committed in America? </p>
<p> I saw a 2 hour program showing these murderous gangs in America and it makes me ill that &#8220;our&#8221; government wants this to happen. They play their games of &#8220;trying to stop it&#8221;, just like they do on the war on drugs. All phoney!</p>

		<p>I truly dread the day when the Anglo-saxon rule of law is displaced. Most people do not understand how the rule of law out of Medieval England shaped the way for human rights, commerce, and democracy. A strong independent judiciary is the only safeguard to equality, and fosters a system of clean dealing amongst the populous in every facet of life - otherwise known as Social Contract. <br>
When one looks outward at the rest of the world, not blessed with such a system, one sees a corruption societies where the strong bully the weak. <br>
These are the societies outside of USA, Canada, Australia, and the UK. Corruption is rampant, the governments are in collusion with criminals, and crime and poverty are endemic. </p>
<p>People in the western nations have taken all this for granted, and cannot even comprehend what it is like to live in places where warlords and gangsters dictate policy through fear. Only in common law nations is their true democracy and human rights. Every other place is just Darwinian. </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the problem? The Zetas are simply doing the jobs that American gangs can&rsquo;t do as well or as cheaply. Zetas are disemploying American criminals, just as Orientals and Indians are disemploying white male scientists and engineers. It&rsquo;s all good according to America&rsquo;s liberals and America&rsquo;s wealthy. </p>

		<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Cantarell oil field, once one of the largest in the world, produced 2.1 million barrels per day ten years ago. It is now down to 400,000 barrels per day with continuing declines due to peak oil effects. The Ke-Maloob-Zapp field has been brought online to replace it and currently produces 800,000 barrels per day. This field is expected to peak in 2013. </p>
<p>The nature of the Mexican people has created an economy that consists of cheap labor, oil royalties going to the government cartel, and drug money going to the gangs. As their oil reserves continue to be depleted the Mexican government is in trouble, likely leading to a collapse and massive migration north, unless there is something in place to prevent it. I would suggest a big fence and a fleet of buses to make sure that those who stray are returned to the correct side of that fence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here at McDonald&rsquo;s and the help is complaining that they are only getting 5 hours of work per week. Therefore, I conclude that the United States has no shortage of cheap labor.<br>

<p>Did the Reagan amnesty of 1986  <i>ignite a massive level of racial consciousness among American whites?</i></p>
<p>None at all that I know of!   Yawn.</p>
<p>Most Americans were too busy with their acquisitions, their gadgets, their sports obsessions, and their celebrity culture, to notice such things as aliens in their midst.</p>
<p>Those that did were denounced as disgusting, immoral racists. The rest kept their mouths shut, reached for a beer, and went went back to the TV.</p>

     Exactly.  About ten years ago, I went to an air show in southern California.  They were searching for weapons at the entrance, including pocketknives, as if anyone was going to hijack a P-51 Mustang.  I pointed out the absurdity to the two Hispanic cops (LAPD), and the male sneered, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like it, go to another country&#8221;, while the female laughed.    They can&rsquo;t wait until we&rsquo;re weak enough for them to start demanding bribes, the &#8220;mordita&#8221; as they call it, the &#8220;little bite&#8221;.  They&rsquo;re not our cops anymore.

		<p>  Mexico does not have the Anglo-Saxon jury system. In Mexico Judges, who are frequently corrupt, decide guilt or innocence. Will this system replace ours as the Southwest becomes majority Hispanic? Do the people make a land a decent place to live or do national customs and laws? Clearly, many Mexican immigrants are not assimilating. Phoenix, Arizona is now the kidnap capital of the United States, and with criminal immigrants like the Zeta&rsquo;s moving in, Phoenix will soon be America&rsquo;s murder capital. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Sheriff Gonzalez said U.S. authorities on the border are outgunned and outmanned by drug smugglers armed with automatic weapons, grenades and state-of-the-art communications and tracking systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Armed with automatic weapons?&#8221;  Wait a minute.  Hasn&rsquo;t the Mexican politicians, the Obama goons and radical leftist MSM been trying to make us believe the drug gangs get their arms from the US even though the US doesn&rsquo;t sell &#8220;automatic rifles?&#8221;  And certainly not grenades.  These anti-gun liars can never be relied on to report the truth on ANY situation.  Everything they utter is tainted with a desire to propagandize.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in this article, but it&rsquo;s well known the Zetas have RPG&rsquo;s which can render a tank inoperable and can easily take down a helicopter. Too, do they have shoulder-fired missiles as well?  There are hundreds of Stinger missiles unaccounted for which the US supplied to Afghanistan to aid in their fight with the Russians. </p>
<p>As the article admits, the drug gangs have so much money they can buy state of the art equipment, and that equipment is available on the black market obtained from many different countries. These cartels do not want semi-automatic weapons made in the US, when they can buy AK-47&rsquo;s that can fire on fully automatic.  To expect anyone to believe the weapon of choice for paramilitary cartels are those with reduced firepower is the kind of nonsense only the imbecilic left can come up with. </p>
<p>Also, the US military knows full well that much equipment has been obtained by the cartels from the countries in Central and South America&hellip;where warfare has been common in the past, some of which carries on today.  </p>
<p>Too, the Mexican government won&rsquo;t admit it, but many of their own weapons are in cartel hands.  Are we expected to believe a corrupt government and military will take drug money and conspire with drug gangs, but they won&rsquo;t sell weapons to them? </p>
<p>&#8220;He said drug profits have allowed the cartels, particularly the Zetas, to develop &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in explosives, wiretapping, countersurveillance, lock-picking and Global Positioning System technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The original ones were trained by US Special Forces, so there is no doubt they have these skills, which reportedly they have passed on to other recruits over the last several years.</p>
<p>The border patrol is outgunned and is no match for these people.  That will be apparent if they become even more emboldened and decide to soften up the border in order to facilitate the transitioning of a major shipment of narcotics into the US at some point&hellip;.or for any other reason they deem to be to their advantage.</p>

<p>What you wrote about the treasonous Reagan amnesty is true. But what you leave out is the scale issue. And the scale issue is absoulutely crucial to understanding what has happened over the past 25 years and predicting what will  happen if amnesty is passed.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, as the scale of nonwhite immigration has increased so has opposition to nonwhite immigration. It is night and day compared to when the treasonous Ronnie Reagan Amensty was passed. The things that are being discussed today on the internet and   among thousands of ordinary Native Born White Americans were not being discussed when Reagan&rsquo;s treasonous amnesty was passed.  And what thousands of ordinary Native Born White Americans are discussing-with increasing frequency-is the racial transformation of America. This is not the least bit suprising since more and more Native Born White Americans are having increasing contact with a rapidly increasing nowhite population.</p>
<p>So there is now doubt there is a transformation occuring in the Native Born White Americans population. And very strong evidence of this is the very thin veneer of civility that exists in &#8220;American&#8221; society which was very briefly blown off on 9/11..and it was very nasty for that first month after 9/11. It would have come off on Nov 8 2008 if McCain had won the election..thousands of Native Born White American Males that night-and the subsequent weeks later-would have experienced extreme violence at the hands of enraged black males..no doubt about it.</p>
<p>I am of the view that lots of gasoline has been poured into the basement of America&hellip;.and we are only a match or two away from racial conflagration. My view is that the passage of Amnesty is the match that will ignite the whole thing.</p>
<p>I believe that some people in the Native Born White American Patriot movement are  assuming that millions of Native Born White Americans will put up with anything. This is a false assumption to be making. </p>
<p>If you voted for Ronnie Reagan, you voted for his treasonous race-replacing amnesty. Ronnie Reagan&rsquo;s 1986 amnesty created a huge voting block for erasing the border between Mexico and America. The flood of Mexican gangbangers into America&rsquo;s towns,cities,National Parks and  National Forests is a direct consequence of Ronnie Reagan&rsquo;s treasonous amnesty in 1986.</p>

		<p>I live in the Southwest, in California to be exact. We have had problems here for a number of years. I never thought it could be worse, but it is. What were once peaceful suburbs and bedroom communities are now overcrowded warzones. What were once peaceful, clean, farming communities, are now dying, third world pools. When I drive through what was once rural California, I am reminded of post apocalyptic movies such as &#8220;The Road&#8221; and &#8220;Mad Max&#8221;.  That might sound paranoid and exaggerated to liberals&hellip;but I recommend any doubters to see for themselves. Death and decay has become reality here in California. </p>

		<p>Great Psyops Tactics.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The U.S. Homeland Security Department has said that Mexican drug cartels, including the Zetas, have infiltrated 276 U.S. cities and represent the nation&rsquo;s most serious organized-crime threat.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Deny the crime threat until you can &#8216;organize it&rsquo; so that the apparency is one of criminals rather than the Mexican cultural norm.  &#8216;It&rsquo;s not race, it&rsquo;s mafia!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, the next step is to create a &#8216;Mexican Tragedy&rsquo; on our side of the border so that the combination of pity and remorse at the thought of sending these people home to Mexico will _force_ amnesty.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s being made brutally clear that the border will not be defended, by anyone, until those Mexican breeders are normalized as part of our population.</p>
<p>This despite the fact that we are spending billions a year (15 billion in 2010, from the feds alone) to fight a &#8216;drug war&rsquo; which would stop immediately if we spent 4 billion to build a damn barrier.</p>
<p>Seven Point Three Million (a 34% growth rate in a decade) Hispanics compared to Census expectations in the Southwest.  If we give amnesty to people who are having 3-5 kids per family, we are outbred in a generation anyway.  And no oil to continue the consumer economic picture that they support.</p>
<p>Just remember, the number one way we have been led astray, historically, has been through crises whose &#8216;dynamically evolving nature&rsquo; required a massive intervention without thought or rational investigation as to who was manipulating whom.</p>
<p>Boston Commons, Maine, Lusitania, Pearl Harbor, Tonkin, Kuwait.  NONE were &#8216;unknown&rsquo; eventualities because ALL were engineered to create the emergency and it&rsquo;s consequences.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to be taken in again because we are no longer fighting other people&rsquo;s wars, we are talking about the survival of our own country and culture.</p>
<p>It has to be a fence AND _no amnesty_.</p>
<p>Or it has to be preparations to secede.</p>
<p>And if it is the latter, you have just declared civil war on the nation&rsquo;s elites who _will_ use the military to stop it.  If we don&rsquo;t have a nuclear option to force the stalemate.</p>
<p>Borderzine 7.3 million &#8216;new neighbors&rsquo;<br>

<p>I also want it known that I am against legalizing drugs.  The damage they do to society and our genes -does- outway the immediate financial savings inherent to fighting them and there is _no proof_ that the criminal gangs now supplying the stuff would &#8216;go away&rsquo; if it were to be legalized.</p>
<p>Punish the dope heads.  Kill the smugglers outright.  CLOSE THE BORDER.  And dial up your Congressman to ask for legislation that forces immediate recall on any President who makes a promise he later renegs on.  If we cannot control our elites, it&rsquo;s time to replace -their- population.</p>

		<p>What would the government do to thwart the Zetas?  First off, they don&rsquo;t care.  Even if they did, their solution would probably be about as useful as shooting spitballs at a panzer tank.  If the government did care and tried to do something about the Zetas they would start by tying both hands around their own backs bowing to PC.  The only way to defeat a group like this would be to use their own tactics because that is all they understand and respect.  Unfortunately, this only plausible solution would also &#8220;offend Latinos&#8221; or &#8220;violate a Zeta&rsquo;s civil rights.&#8221;  Your government, our government (a) does not care (b) would not allow itself to win if it did care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I truly dread the day when the Anglo-Saxon rule of law is displaced&hellip;People in the western nations have taken all this for granted and cannot even comprehend what it is like to live in places where warlords and gangsters dictate policy through fear&rdquo;.<br>
Exactly. About ten years ago, I went to an air show in southern California. They were searching for weapons at the entrance, including pocketknives, as if anyone was going to hijack a P-51 Mustang. I pointed out the absurdity to the two Hispanic cops (LAPD), and the male sneered, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, go to another country&rdquo;, while the female laughed. They can&rsquo;t wait until we&rsquo;re weak enough for them to start demanding bribes, the &ldquo;mordita&rdquo; as they call it, the &ldquo;little bite&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re not our cops anymore. It already is another country. &#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is extremely scary!<br>
When I travel, even in places like Greece or Italy, the public sector is more akin to Mexico or Brazil. <br>
Nothing is efficient in these countries. Even the so-called public health depends on &#8216;envelopes&rsquo;&hellip;and this is to bribe doctors, who are naturally suppose to be held to a higher standard morally!</p>
<p>These types of countries will always be dysfunctional&hellip;and one can see it in the extreme in places such as Mexico and Brazil, where narco-terror has become a type of sub-government. </p>
<p>The worse part is that the general populous there, as well as in the U.S., has come to accept it through complacency or fear. <br>
In the 1950&rsquo;s for example this type of terror would not have been tolerated, as it destabilizes not only the neighboring country but also the United States. Foreign military intervention would have been called for and would have easily stamped out the problem. But in the politically correct age &#8216;crime&rsquo; is a symptom of poverty and oppression, not ever corruption, treason, or evil. </p>
<p>Decapitations, medieval torture, bribery, systematic rape, and bombings occur daily south of the border, yet it is accepted by-and-large as almost natural. These criminals cross into U.S. and bring that same corrupt mentality and disdain for human life with them. It is only a matter of time before this type of dysfunctional thinking completely infects our system. <br>
There is a simple and clear reason why England and it&rsquo;s offspring, like the U.S. prospered and remained stable places to raise families and contribute, it was respect for justice and the rule of law. This is eroding in all western nations, and soon these nations will become unlivable&hellip;I know first hand, and I completely dread the day when Anglos are displaced. <br>
Nothing can ever be secure, not families, not property, not life. </p>
<p>This is what the left wants, for us&hellip;complete instability&hellip;equality but only in hell.  </p>

		<p>Local governments commit federal felonies by not allowing local police to cooperate with immigration and customs enforcement.</p>
<p>If Americans are to stop the flow of illegal drug gangs, American&rsquo;s must abolish sanctuary cities and place value into our laws by prosecuting local politicians who violate them. </p>

<p>**** I work with Latino high schoolers.  Nearly all the mexican boys, and I use that term loosely, because many are way overage, brag how they are either already in a gang or will one day be in one.  The mexican government cannot win because if 50-60% of your young people WANT to join a gang - for the glory and money - then what hope do you have?</p>
<p>Our own gov&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t win for the same reason.  Nearly EVERY black teenager I have ever known was a gangbanger or a wannabe.<br>

		<p>If the US and Mexican FEDGOVs were not totally in bed with these violent drug cartels they would deal with them like they deal with the guerrilla fighters in the Af/Pak/Iraq Forever Wars: aerial bombings and targeted assassinations.   These gangsters operate totally outside civil law and human decency and are, in fact, engaged in open warfare.  They should be dealt with outside the court system Poncho Villa style with punitive military actions. They know exactly who these people are and the legislatures can sign out Letters of Marque for their heads. No judge, no jury, no trial - only surrender or death. This will not happen because FEDGOV and its Bankster owners want to destabilize society, they want the massive drug profits that run through Wall St., and they want nothing to impede the displacement of the White Christian Middle-class with compliant Third-world hordes.</p>
