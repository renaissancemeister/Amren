<h1>Presiding Bishop Leads Service of Repentance for Sin of Racism, Slavery</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Episcopal News Service, April 11, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 500 people attended the service, during which Western North Carolina Bishop G. Porter Taylor acknowledged the church&rsquo;s participation in slavery and the long oppression of Afro-American people. Taylor formally apologized for these sins and asked for forgiveness.</p>
<p>The two-hour-and-twenty minute service was sponsored by the diocese&rsquo;s Commission to Dismantle Racism.</p>
<p>A massed choir, composed of singers from Trinity, St. Matthias and the Cathedral of All Souls, provided a program of music, while members of the congregation were offered the opportunity to receive an anointing of holy oil and a blessing from clergy and lay ministers, black and white.</p>
<p>The processional banner, chasuble and stoles used in the service are visual representations of the healing and reconciliation the service was aiming for. </p>
<p>On behalf of the diocese, Canon Osondu McPeters presented the presiding bishop with a college of words  &mdash;  feelings originally expressed by people in the diocese after viewing the film &#8220;Traces of the Trade,&#8221; a film that tells the story of the DeWolf family, the largest slave-trading family in U.S. history and also a prominent part of the Episcopal Church in Rhode Island. James DeWolf Perry was the 18th presiding bishop.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>General Convention 2006 passed several resolutions on the subject of the church&rsquo;s complicity in slavery as well as other forms of exploitation and abuse of non-white peoples. The resolutions called on dioceses to explore the history of slavery and its aftermath and to find ways to seek reconciliation and healing.<br>

		<p>The Episcopal Church parted ways with Christianity and concern for lost souls long ago. Today it is all about feeling good about itself by patting itself on the back for apologizing for the sins of others.</p>
<p>They have forgotten the words of Christ: Luke 6:46  And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?</p>

		<p>It sounds to me like this is nothing less than a repudiation of their whole religious faith. If these sins of &#8220;racism&#8221; were are all so terrible, then why didn&rsquo;t their faith/God/whatever keep them from doing it? It sounds like they&rsquo;re saying that their faith is worthless, at least as far as keeping them from doing the wrong thing goes. And they wonder why there are so many nonbelievers these days. By the way isn&rsquo;t the Episcopal church one of the organizations that said they would pull out of the Indianapolis convention center if Senate Bill 590 passes?</p>

		<p>Every time I hear of an &#8220;apology&#8221; for slavery, I always wonder who are people are apologising to? The actual slaves have been dead for about 70 to 80 years. How many generations of blacks has happened since the Civil War? Some day this has to end and blacks will have to take responsibility for themselves and stop blaming whites for everything. Whites also need to get over it. Let&rsquo;s go to the museum and tell the mammoth how sorry we are for killing all its ancestors.</p>

		<p>Well, if we can&rsquo;t say obscenities or insults, can we use medical terminology and say, &#8220;Oh, testicles!!!&#8221; to the Episcopalians who participated in this farce?  I left the Roman Catholic Church because of its blind dedication to social justice, and it looks to me like the descendants of Henry VIII are just as bad, if not worse.  Oh, please.  Do you realize how many black Haitians would give their eye fangs to live in this country and to be able to get an education, have a career, and be a decent citizen???  American blacks are more concerned with getting something for nothing, like handouts from the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t because their ancestors were slaves.  I say give &#8216;em a mandatory year of living and working in Haiti.  THEN maybe they might get willing to appreciate and work with the opportunities that are here.  (But, then again, probably not; it&rsquo;s easier to whine).</p>

		<p>I lost &#8220;faith&#8221; in the church ever since it played major role in miscegenation, due to the fact that it is no longer comprised of a homogeneous race and culture.  I hope church leaders are reading this because if you want your flock back, you would do well to promote racial and cultural homogeneity.  But since you insist on perpetual apologizing for sins that I have NOT committed, I say good riddance to all churches and clergy until they grow a spine.</p>

		<p>Did they go over how North Carolina had a large number of black and mulatto(as the legal classification at the time)men were slave holders?  I bet not.</p>
<p>Look, if you hate yourself and have been guilted to shame because of your DNA, fine.  But don&rsquo;t try and bring others down with you.  I wonder how many, if any, walked out.  I would have and never would have went back.  Politics should not be in religion, the separation of church and state can work both ways.</p>
<p>How many of those white people in there even had ancestors that were slave holders?  Probably very few.  How many actually were slave holders? None. </p>

		<p>Many folks have left various churches and denominations as they&rsquo;ve been taken over by strange people with their own agendas, combining group therapy with PC  activism. They&rsquo;ll end up making themselves irrelevant to the average person. Perhaps in this case these Christians should get off their knees and stand up straight for once in their life.</p>

		<p>Two objections come to mind.</p>
<p>In the past whites had other reasons for their actions than just religion. Or sometimes religion was the believed reason because the white population wasn&rsquo;t able to come up other explanations.</p>
<p>I can think of another apology owing, only this time by the church. Even up to a century ago, it was believed by Christians that they had the true religion. Other religions misled their followers. God expected everyone to be converted to Christianity. This was Church policy and it has easily changed the world. Now, of course, the church doesn&rsquo;t believe in any superiority of Christianity over the other religions. For cultural displacement alone, how about an apology from the church? How about an endless string of apologies? Do this before you apologize on the behalf of whites. </p>

<p>Is there a Commission to Dismantle Gravity?</p>
<p>&#8220;Racism&#8221; is a buzzword of the marxists to describe a human &#8220;instinct&#8221; that is such old knowledge that it has lost whatever name it used to have.</p>
<p>All humans for all eternity will be &#8220;racists&#8221;.  For theirs, against others.</p>
<p>PC communism truly seems to be a hardcore faith-based &#8220;religion&#8221; for its adherents.  Good luck to them in their farcical endeavors!  I wish I could check in in 2,000 years to see how their &#8220;plan&#8221; has worked out.</p>

<p>In other words, for ONE HUNDRED YEARS. Wasn&rsquo;t slavery one hundred and fifty years ago and longer? To God, it&rsquo;s a dead issue.</p>
<p>White America has paid for its history of slavery in various ways:<br>
1. Half a million of us died in the Civil War.<br>
2. Hundreds of thousands of us died in WWII battling the white racism of Nazism.<br>
3. 17,000,000 white Americans have been victimized by black crime since 1964 through robbery, rape, and murder.<br>
4.  White Americans have spent a trillion dollars since 1964 in various government handout and welfare programs.</p>

		<p>I am a former born again Christian who left Christianity for reasons such as strong disagreement with scripture. Many of the churches, including the church I used to attend, are very liberal. But I did not leave because of the fact that political correctness has infiltrated many churches.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I still find the idea churches becoming politically correct to be very disturbing. At my former church, one of the ministers sang a religious song in Spanish under the pretext of celebrating our church&rsquo;s &#8220;multicultural heritage,&#8221; even though 99% of the members were white.</p>
<p>Church is not supposed to be a place to advance a social agenda, liberal or otherwise. Visiting a house of God is about praising God and getting more in touch with religion. So many religious leaders, particularly those with liberal-leaning views, have perverted the meaning of church to suit their own ends.</p>

		<p>I was born and raised an Episcopalian. Now I am an Anglican, which is to say a traditional Episcopalian using the 1928 Book of Common Prayer.<br>
 <br>
For quite a few years the second most famous Episcopalian after George H. W. Bush was Bishop Shelby Spong. After writing a number of books attacking the Bible he admitted he did not believe in God. <br>
 <br>
What has happened to the Episcopal Church is an example of late sixties idiocy, and evidence of how deeply the War in Vietnam wounded America. Because seminary students were given draft exemptions unavailable to other graduate students, men went into the clergies of main line denominations who were not appropriate candidates. They were intelligent, concerned, and compassionate, but more suited for secular helping professions like social work, poverty law, and teaching in inner city schools. </p>
