			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Tozer, Daily Mail (London), April 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 60 schoolgirls were groomed for sex by workers at seedy takeaways linked to the murder of a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Children as young as 11 were targeted by mainly Asian staff at fast food outlets in Blackpool. They were offered food, alcohol and cigarettes in return for sexual favours.</p>
<p>An unpublicised police report produced after 14-year-old Charlene Downes vanished in 2003 found the girls, most if not all white, had been victims of the &#8216;honey pot&rsquo; premises. There were claims last night that the report was suppressed for reasons of political correctness.</p>
<p>Four years later another girl, 15-year-old Paige Chivers, also went missing. Detectives believe she was killed like Charlene, whose body has never been found.</p>
<p>Two Middle Eastern restaurant owners were acquitted over Charlene&rsquo;s murder in 2007 and the crime remains unsolved.</p>
<p>The pair still run a kebab shop in Blackpool which was also linked to Paige, and she too was identified as a victim of sexual exploitation. Last year police reported that the takeaway was attracting young girls who were being supplied with alcohol and cocaine.</p>
<p>The revelations about the scale of grooming centred around the downmarket cafes comes amid growing concern at disturbing cases involving mainly Asian gangs exploiting young white girls for sex in the Midlands and North of England. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The girls, often from vulnerable homes or in the care system, were befriended by men who showered them with gifts and affection before using them for sex.</p>
<p>Former Home Secretary Jack Straw has said the girls were seen as &#8216;easy meat&rsquo;, while David Cameron called on police to follow criminal acts &#8216;without fear or favour&rsquo; wherever the evidence leads.</p>
<p>The Home Office commissioned a nationwide investigation into the problem, which has long been considered taboo by police officers fearful of being branded racist.</p>
<p>Indeed, a former senior detective at Lancashire Police yesterday blamed political correctness for its failure to highlight its 2003 findings in Blackpool.</p>
<p>But the force denied this, saying the report had been available online since 2007 but had never been intended for publication.</p>
<p>Senior officers insisted an intensive programme to break the cycle of exploitation had been a success and that in the last six months 50 of 54 grooming suspects were white.</p>
<p>Shocking claims made in court over Charlene&rsquo;s murder revealed fears that her body had been put through a mincing machine, with takeaway staff said to have joked that her remains had &#8216;gone into the kebabs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A jury failed to reach a verdict on charges that Jordanian immigrant Iyad Albattikhi had murdered her while his Iranian landlord Mohammed Reveshi had disposed of her body.</p>
<p>A retrial collapsed in 2008 amid failings in the police investigation and the men were paid almost Â£250,000 each in compensation.</p>
<p>The kebab shop run by Mr Albattikhi and Mr Reveshi has changed its name from Funny Boyz to Mr Beanz. It was refused a hot food licence last year amid fears about &#8216;sexual activity&rsquo; linked to the premises, but the pair blame a &#8216;police vendetta&rsquo; and have appealed. </p>
<p>Following Charlene&rsquo;s disappearance in 2003, police found more than 60 girls were being groomed for sex by non-white men centred around 11 Blackpool takeaways.</p>
<p>They were mainly aged between 13 and 15, but some were as young as 11. Yesterday former Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell warned that research into the problem was being hampered by &#8216;political correctness and concerns about upsetting community cohesion&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But Lancashire police denied a cover-up. Assistant Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said his officers were making significant progress in tackling child sex exploitation across Lancashire, regardless of the background of the culprits.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;We recognise that in some areas the number of Asian offenders is disproportionate to the population and far from ignoring this, have been tackling the issue head on by working with the local communities, giving presentations to community forums and visiting mosques to raise awareness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday that while most British sex offenders are lone white men, details of court cases in 13 towns showed that out of 56 men convicted of multiple offences of grooming girls for sex, 50 were Muslim, mostly of Pakistani heritage.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a class as well as a racial component to this horror: upper class Britons, notably in the political class, uniformly have such disdain and contempt for ordinary, working-class white Britons that they turn a blind eye to such atrocities, their insouciance buttressed by the ever-useful pretext of &#8220;anti-racism.&#8221;  Labour is the most despicable offender among this class, but the blame must also be shared among the other &#8220;mainstream&#8221; British parties such as the Tories.  &#8220;La Trahison des Clercs,&#8221; a Frenchman called it.</p>

		<p>&#8216;14-year-old Charlene Downes vanished in 2003&rsquo;, a friend of mine in the police told me that he was personally convinced that the reason Charlene was never found was because she was actually &#8216;used&rsquo; in the kebab shop.</p>
<p>Incidentially, that kebab shop is still open and run by the same people suspected of killing and butchering Charlene.</p>
<p>There have been repeated attempts by people to raise the issue of widespread abuse of women by Pakistani men, but they have been either ignored by the MSM or else openly mocked as backward racists. Better than young girls suffer than anything challenge the multicultural consensus, apparently. </p>

		<p>If immigrants had done this in any non-white country, and then been acquitted and reopened their business, they would have been lynched.  What the hell is wrong with white people that we allow other races to come into our country, rape and murder young girls and then PAY them a huge amount of money?  I&rsquo;d like to say that America is better, but every white country except for Russia seems to be equally bad.  </p>

<p>Blather.</p>
<p>If they were white there would be no fear of &#8216;Political Correctness&rsquo; or &#8216;community cohesion&rsquo; to worry about as a justification for restricted publication, now would there?</p>
<p>&#8216;Bowling Alone&rsquo; is a natural prejudice because, in the wild, a single improper mating can mess up generations of specialist genetic development and leave the hybrid offspring with no sympathy in either parent population with which to start over.</p>
<p>Populations stick together to conserve useful, singular, allele traits inherent to their particular survival mechanisms.  Among sentient humans, we call these folkways.</p>
<p>Where one side of a given group mixing interface is clearly deficient to the other, genetically, in terms of achieved capabilities (SWA has not advanced in the 1400 years since Mohammed) you have scavenging predatorism that seeks to steal what it cannot achieve on it&rsquo;s own in a Promethian manner.</p>
<p>Obviously, the best and prettiest of a given gene group are &#8216;protected&rsquo; by the promise (if you stay loyal) of elite positions, pairings and preferential treatment.</p>
<p>These two young women, with their tart expression and lipstick at 14 are clearly not part of that privileged group and so found it simpler to sell early rather than wait for better, white, bids.</p>
<p>And our profound racial cowardice in failing to confront their lack of discipline as much as these interloper&rsquo;s perverse sexual interest in underage minors, is what lies at the root of this.</p>
<p>It will get worse.  Because once they have a taste of white innocence, the SWAians will want more as their own marital landscapes have been desolate for centuries.  And ALL of our young women will be vulnerable to men whose patrons are filthy rich from the drug trade and worse.</p>
<p>The UK is finished if they don&rsquo;t ethnically &#8216;restructure&rsquo; themselves along radical retranchist political as racial lines.  </p>
<p>Their elite leadership system has failed them, utterly.</p>

<p>Sad thing is, I bet you British hipsters &amp; liberals will still eat those vile kebabs, wouldn&rsquo;t want to boycott Pakistani establishments. That would be racist.</p>

<p>If my daughter were involved in this, these &#8220;men&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about a &#8220;police vendetta&#8221; I simply don&rsquo;t understand why so many English parents tolerate this&hellip;well! I guess I do since we in America would suffer the same fate if we accused the protected blacks or muslims of ANY crime of ANY sort, especially against Whites.</p>

		<p>The British press should stop referring to these criminals as Asians. <br>
Identify them as Paks. or Afghans. That would be much more accurate. An alternative might be Subcontinental ASIANS.</p>

		<p>Nothing new.  The parents should have taught them better.  This has been occurring for over A THOUSAND YEARS to girls from the west.</p>
<p>The parents should sue the govt and try to bring attention to the problem since the police will not.</p>
<p>Also, this is the new Orwellian issue.  Instead of Communism popping up it is multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Emotions have now replaced facts almost completely.  You do not say or act on something without checking how many peoples&rsquo; feelings will be hurt.  And white feelings do not count. </p>

		<p>These acts of pure evil carried out by these predator immigrants will not go unpunished by the English men. Vast amounts of alcohol will be consumed and then they will talk about football and then drink some more.<br>
That will teach those damn immigrants that are molesting and killing their children.</p>

		<p>To Seneca the Younger. The one girl on the left was a foster child, so sadly, her family didn&rsquo;t give a damn about her. I assume Paige was in a similar situation. That their own parents (White) aren&rsquo;t chided and scorned by more people is a major disservice. They were neglected by not only their own kind, but their own blood. That is just as sickening as any Paki sex ring that they were involved in. Yeah, Muslim hypocrites they are. I bet you any $ that Muslim women would be outraged by this because the offenders are choosing White flesh. But a woman has no rights in the Middle East so they think Western women shouldn&rsquo;t have right eirher, get it? </p>
