			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Expatica, April 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Dutch court on Monday rejected anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders&rsquo; bid for the withdrawal of a panel of judges chosen to try him for hate speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;The request for recusal is denied,&#8221; A.J. van der Meer, the presiding judge of an independent panel set up to hear Wilders&rsquo; application, said at a hearing broadcast via the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We order the resumption of the trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>This had been Wilders&rsquo; second application for the withdrawal of judges on the grounds of bias.</p>
<p>He had won the first round shortly after his trial started in October last year, when his judges were ordered to step down by a panel of their peers who upheld the politician&rsquo;s bias claims. </p>
<p>In March, the new judges ruled that the trial must go ahead, dismissing Wilders&rsquo; claims that they had no jurisdiction in the case.</p>
<p>Wilders&rsquo; lawyer Bram Moszkowicz told the court last Friday he believed the judges to be partial as they had refused to order a probe of a witness accused of lying to the court.</p>
<p>But van der Meer said there was no proof of impartiality, adding &#8220;irritation is not enough of a reason for a recusal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilders, 47, faces five counts of giving offence to Muslims and of inciting hatred against Muslims and people of non-Western immigrant origin, particularly Moroccans.</p>
<p>The allegations arise partly from the short film &#8220;Fitna&#8221;, which catapulted Wilders to international notoriety in 2008 and in which he mixes Koranic verses with footage of extremist attacks.</p>
<p>Wilders likens the Koran to Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221;.</p>
<p>The MP, whose Party for Freedom came third in elections last year and gives parliamentary support to a right-leaning coalition, faces up to a year in jail or a 7,600 euro (10,300 dollar) fine for comments made in his campaign to &#8220;stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prosecutors initially dismissed dozens of complaints against Wilders in June 2008 but were compelled by appeals judges to mount a case against him.<br>

<p>Blasphemy trials.  Western police and Western courts trying people for the &#8216;offence&rsquo; of offending against Islam.  No longer a wild prediction, but the actual reality today.</p>
<p>BBC News today   &#8221;Ex-soldier jailed for burning Koran in Carlisle&#8221; </p>

<p>A man has just gone to prison in England for the &#8216;crime&rsquo; of descrating the Koran. Step by step our Western civilisation is sold out from under our feet.</p>

<p>I would have never imagined that saying something that is factual and common sense would get someone into this much trouble in the West.  Clearly the nuts have taken over the asylum.</p>
<p>On a good note, since Wilders is very popular in his country, nothing will come of this.  This is just to set an example to the common man that cannot afford the legal fees and publicity.  The same is said for the U.S. </p>
<p>Kobe got off a rape charge because of his money.  The average Joe would have went to jail or copped a plea for a lesser sentence since they are not as well off financially.  I know a guy that got accused of rape by his ex-fiance.  The rape kit came back negative and she changed her story three times on the stand.  The prosecutor wouldn&rsquo;t drop the case because he could have sued the courts.  He got 4 counts of life knocked down to probation, as if that doesn&rsquo;t raise any questions.</p>
<p>There are two sets of laws in America and Europe:  Those for the wealthy and everyone else.  Although this Wilders case is an abomination, it is just a walk-through to show the common citizen what will happen to him and how much it will cost if he does the same thing.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ANYONE DARE to believe this. And lest we forget, Jordan still has a warrant out for him for blasphemy and in all liklihood, the Dutch will send him to Jordan and he will be beheaded at which, the Dutch government will &#8220;protest in the strongest terms&#8221; which in my case, would be a tactical nuke on Amman.</p>

		<p>I keep saying I&rsquo;m going to stop visiting Am Ren, because I know that it&rsquo;s a mad world, and very few whites know or care. <br>
But then I see more madness. Poster 1 has  it right. We are actually practicing Sharia Law FOR the Muslims, before Sharia has even been implemented. <br>
Just a warm-up for the big show, eh?<br>
Truly revolting. What could top anything, anymore? What would stand out in a day&rsquo;s news? I can&rsquo;t see how anything matters anymore!</p>

		<p>Might do the man some good, politically, for the same reasons it did Hitler good.  Having stood up for his rights and all, this would be seen as an act of &#8216;civil disobedience&rsquo; more than anything.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t know how their system works.  In our country, you don&rsquo;t stand a snowflake&rsquo;s chance to serve once you&rsquo;ve &#8216;served time&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What bothers me is this sentence-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Prosecutors initially dismissed dozens of complaints against Wilders in June 2008 but were compelled by appeals judges to mount a case against him.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>That sounds a lot like &#8216;social justice&rsquo; which is to say a case brought by nameless authorities in response to public peer pressure after initial complaints failed meet prima facia grounds for indictment.</p>
<p>If the world still stands on fundamental principles of truth over social discomfort, it will be asked: is &#8216;Fitna&rsquo; in error in any of it&rsquo;s assertions?  If not, why is it the basis of his hate crime offenses?</p>
<p>For Wilders to have commited a racial hate crime, to me, would require him to have made defamatory comments as slander/libel where something is said or written that is proveably false for what it suggests as being anti-social behaviors inherent to Muslim populations.</p>
