<h1>Hate Crime Report at UNC Was False, Police Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>News &amp; Observer (Raleigh), April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A UNC-Chapel Hill freshman who told police he was attacked by a man who burned his hand and called him an anti-gay slur made a false report, the university says. </p>
<p>In a message just released to the campus community, Chancellor Holden Thorp says: &#8220;The Department of Public Safety has determined that the alleged aggravated assault reported to campus last night did not occur. That report, filed with campus police on April 5, was false. The University will not report it as a hate crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Freshman Quinn Matney told police he was outside his South Campus dorm April 4 when he stopped to speak with an acquaintance. As he stood on a foot bridge near his Craige Residence Hall, he had said another college-age man nearby approached him, called him an anti-gay slur, and pressed a hot piece of metal to his left wrist.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>THE ORIGINAL STORY IS BELOW</p>
<p>Authorities at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are investigating an assault on campus last week as a hate crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a university community, we condemn this act of violence,&#8221; said UNC-CH Chancellor Holden Thorp in a statement on Alert Carolina, the campus website that disseminates safety-related information to students, faculty and staff. &#8220;Our Department of Public Safety will bring the strongest possible charges against the attacker.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone in our community has the right to a safe, inclusive and welcome living and learning environment,&#8221; Thorp said. &#8220;And all of us have a responsibility to stand against acts of violence, harassment, bullying and intimidation and to treat each other with civility and respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s troubling when the only way we find out about a hate crime on campus is by word of mouth,&#8221; said Jeff DeLuca, a sophomore and co-president of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Straight Alliance. <br>

		<p>Stories like this out of Raleigh seem somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>The script reads that Matney will not even be charged by police with misdemeanor false reporting; he will be described as &#8220;confused&#8221; instead.  In a few years, Matney will dump a partner&rsquo;s clothes in the bathtub of their apartment and set them on fire, but will skate on the arson charges, assuming any are ever filed.  Eventually he will stab another partner.</p>

<p>Unless of course, it&rsquo;s harassing, bullying, intimidating and treated with white men with disrespect on our very same campus. Because they it&rsquo;s nearly mandatory, and part of being appropriately sensitive to women and people of color. Because they&rsquo;ve suffered so much in our past. </p>

		<p>We had a similar fake gay &#8220;crime&#8221; at boise state university a few years back &#8216;coincidentally&rsquo; when the state was voting on a measure to ban homo marriage. I was done by a &#8220;student leader&#8221; of a homo group of course. This faker had self inflicted bruises and a tearful sob story of his &#8220;attack&#8221; by white males uttering homo slurs. </p>
<p>As far as I know NOTHING was done to him after all the hatred and hetero white male bashing that went on for a week or so&hellip; </p>

		<p>I dont know what this moron burned himself on but one thing is for sure- if you are going to lie then make sure that your lie is believable. Nobody carries around a hot piece of metal to assault somebody with, a knife, gun, lead pipe or any other object would make sense but a hot piece of metal? Not believable at all!</p>

		<p>MSNBC&rsquo;s website had an article about the increase of piracy incidents by the Somalis.</p>
<p>I posted the following after which I got a message informing me that they encountered a problem while creating my account. That happens frequently when one crosses the PC line.</p>
<p> &#8220;I cannot understand why we&rsquo;re sitting back and watching these Somali pirates killing people. We know the location of their HQ. There should be a massive assault using every weapon system short of Nukes. They need to be annihilated. We ignore African thuggery including the horrific genocide/ rape being perpetrated against White farmers and their families both in Zimbabwe and in South Africa. I&rsquo;ve seen the photos of the corpses of young women who were gang raped and then hideously mutilated. Of course here in the US similar things are also being carried out . Have we already forgotten Knoxville just to mention one of many like incidents?&#8221;</p>
<p>One could infer that atrocious brutality against Caucasians is perfectly acceptable and PC when it&rsquo;s being carried out by Blacks.</p>

		<p>This society is becoming an absurdist twilight zone.  A half century ago, homosexuality was recognized as a mental illness, and now it&rsquo;s touted as normal and even desirable.  Many conservatives even parrot the same lines as the far left when it comes to this issue.  Both major parties have betrayed the American people when it comes to this, Affirmative Action, and the open-borders illegal influx.</p>

		<p><i>Chancellor Holden Thorp says: &ldquo;The Department of Public Safety has determined that the alleged aggravated assault reported to campus last night did not occur. That report, filed with campus police on April 5, was false. The University will not report it as a hate crime.&rdquo;<br>
</i></p>
<p>This story was reported April 12th, according to the dateline above. The original bogus slander was filed on April 5th. </p>
<p>In that week, easily-angered blacks could have killed a white man or raped a white woman in retaliation for a &#8220;crime&#8221; that came out of a person&rsquo;s imagination&hellip;and yet white people will still bury this under the rug. </p>
<p>Someone needs a one-way ticket back to Africa. </p>

		<p>5 Spartan 24: Exactly.  If the attack did not take place in a foundry or welding shop, assault by hot piece of metal is just not very plausible.  I think that cops usually have a pretty good idea when you&rsquo;re making things up, being much more intelligent than your average college administrator.  </p>

		<p>If I were going to a college and said that I feel opressed by something they might listen at first because I&rsquo;m a woman, but once they caught on that I was feeling oppressed for being White, straight and Christian they would start comitting real hate crimes against me. <br>
 @# 10: zack is right, it should be prosecuted as a hate crime against straight white men!, oh wait, privileged minorities are given awards for hating white people!<br>
@#12: you&rsquo;re right, it will become a hate crime for a White not to be dating a non-white.</p>
