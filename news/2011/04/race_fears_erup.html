			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A town just three miles from the scene of major race riots is set to become the first in the UK to have a BNP member as its mayor.</p>
<p>Councillors have voted overwhelmingly for John Cave to take over as civic leader of Padiham, Lancashire.</p>
<p>But critics have warned the appointment reflects poorly on the town and argued that he cannot serve the whole community without &#8216;rejecting his party&rsquo;s philosophy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Councillor Cave has previously claimed that party politics were behind those who opposed his selection.</p>
<p>He will become Deputy Mayor in the next civic year and take the chains of office 12 months later.</p>
<p>He says he is proud to serve the town, which is situated about three miles from Burnley and has a population of around 9,000.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It is a vote of confidence. This is my home town and I was born here. It is all about Padiham and Padiham is not about politics.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is my home and my aim is to make it a lot better place to live. I will be really proud to be mayor.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Councillor Cave is married to BNP Lancashire County Councillor Sharon Wilkinson.</p>
<p>&#8216;The system was arranged so everyone could have a chance. One or two opposed the idea and interpreted the rules in a different way. If all the councillors had voted &#8216;no&rsquo;, I would have said they didn&rsquo;t want me on the council but the majority are happy with the decision.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is a non-political council and my politics have not encroached on what happens in Padiham. It has been easier than I expected to remain non-political in the past 12 months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Bishop of Burnley John Goddard said he was not happy with the decision.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I always see the role of the mayor and deputy mayor as the chief citizen of the community, and they have a responsibility to uphold and defend the rights of all British citizens of the town, regardless of race, colour or status</p>
<p>&#8216;Given that, I look forward to the deputy mayor showing that the BNP are wrong in their racist policies</p>
<p>&#8216;It will be interesting to see if he acts in the best traditions of a mayor in the community, and I pray he does, as he will have to reject the philosophy of the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8216;If he retains the BNP political philosophy then how can he expect to serve and represent the whole of the community?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The role means Councillor Cave, who is married to BNP Lancashire County Councillor Sharon Wilkinson and has been a councillor for just 12 months, will take over the chains from current mayor Bob Clark in a year.</p>
<p>Councillor Shah Hussain, who represents Daneshouse and Stoneyholme on Burnley Council, said: &#8216;I have concerns with what the BNP stands for and its policies. It is a party that is divisive to the community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Hope not Hate campaign, which celebrates &#8216;modern Britain&rsquo; and claims to expose the BNP, said: &#8216;We are disappointed that anybody holding the views of the BNP can secure a position of this kind.</p>
<p>&#8216;The role of mayor in any community is to act as the figurehead of the community and we don&rsquo;t see how that role can be carried out by anybody who represents a party whose sole aim is to divide communities.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Peter Pike, former Labour MP in Burnley, said: &#8216;I think it is unfortunate that we have councillors who represent the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8216;And now I think it is unfortunate that we have a deputy mayor in Padiham who represents the BNP.</p>
<p>&#8216;But if they are elected on to a council then there is always a chance they could hold a mayoral title.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There has been a mixed response from the town&rsquo;s residents.</p>
<p>Terry Smith, 32, said: &#8216;The BNP shouldn&rsquo;t have any power really, and certainly not be mayor of the town. It doesn&rsquo;t look good for the town.&rsquo; </p>
<p>But pensioner Harold Wilkinson, 71, said: &#8216;If he&rsquo;s been elected by the people then I do not see or have a problem with it.&rsquo; </p>
<p>And Ann Cooper, 61, of Padiham Green, said: &#8216;They have been voted for so they have a right to be on the council, they are a legitimate party.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Padiham town clerk Elizabeth Bolton said after the confusion regarding the standing order rules were quashed, it was a simple decision. </p>
<p>&#8216;There was no real argument or debate about it once the rules were clarified,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am pleased it has been sorted and we can now move forward. I&rsquo;m sure over the next 12 months Councillor Cave will have the opportunity to gain some great experience as deputy mayor ready for being mayor the year after.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Padiham is not far from Blackburn, which is also in the news late last week, because the teachers at a high school just south of Blackburn went on strike (the first ever teachers strike in the UK) to protest violent crimes and lawlessness on campus.  As one can read above, the Daily Mail, (Tory Party mouthpiece), is worried that Padiham having a BNP mayor might lead to &ldquo;race problems.&rdquo;  Seems to me that ship sailed a long time ago, which is why the city council voted for a BNP mayor to begin with.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a blog I read on a regular basis, (I won&rsquo;t say which one), recently had a post accusing Nick Griffin of being an MI5 agent, sent in from on high to &ldquo;ruin&rdquo; the BNP.  NickG sure did a good job ruining the BNP  &mdash;  Two Members of the European Parliament (himself and Andrew Brons), double digit percentages in some constituencies, a significant handful of local/municipal city council seats, constantly improving percentages in national elections, and now a city&rsquo;s mayor.  All of that took place under Nick Griffin&rsquo;s watch, none of that under any of his predecessors.  That particular blog seems to be a production of the Tyndallite gang/mentality that ran the BNP pre-NickG, and whose dispossession from the BNP after Nick Griffin gaining power was not on cheerful terms.</p>

<p>Seldom if ever is an elected representitive in agreement with all of the electorate.</p>
<p>How many years have nationalists had to endure Parliamentarians who didn&rsquo;t represent their interests?</p>

		<p>I suspect that a majority of Brits have a huge resentment about non-Brits taking over their country.  That primarily means Muslims, but it also means any other minorities that have been allowed in.  Europe is waking up to the idea of taking back what is rightfully theirs, and always has been.  I pray they keep it up!</p>

<p>Did you see the picture of this little wimp in the original article? He couldn&rsquo;t fight his way out of a paper bag. Another useful idiot thats too stupid to realize that he would be one of  the first ones to have his head cut off by his beloved muslims!<br>
The stupidity of these people is truely mind-boggling! </p>

<p>So, those concerned with conservatism or even the welfare of whites cannot rule over the general public in a fair manner? Why didn&rsquo;t they think of this argument all during the last 50 years, where politicians and school teachers have been obsessed with helping non-whites and non-whites only?</p>

<p>Another useless clergyman.  Instead of preaching for a Christianizing of secular and Islamized England, he is worried about offering platitudes about civil rights.  Muslims becoming a majority in Britain is somehow not a problem for the &#8220;Bishop.&#8221;  Rather, it is the BNP having ONE mayor in the whole country.</p>

<p>England was for the English for almost 500 years with no SWAian presence at all.  During this time, places like Pakistan and AfG and Persia and Arabia were little more than tribal kingdoms while the Europeans were getting ready to create the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Nobody -wants- to be allowed to be &#8216;equal members&rsquo; of Mr. Hussain&rsquo;s homeland, not that they could if they did because SWA is for the Muslims.  By racist decree.</p>
<p>It never fails to amaze me the sheer gall of people who know they are not wanted by their common man neighbors yet insist on publicly ringing the &#8216;just a member of the community&rsquo; bell on public unity with our disgustingly head-blind leadership.</p>
<p>This despite the horrific effect they and their own culture have on social welfare depletion, crime and overall economic prosperity of England as an immigrant class so utterly unlike that of the indigenous group as to -never- be wanted as marital partners and thus ALWAYS competing for economic pie slices that will never be returned and thus will never be &#8216;common&rsquo; again, once lost.</p>
<p>What idiot thinks that exotic cuisine and &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; eccentricities of affected appearance and attitude is worth this?</p>
<p>The worst thing about the Reductio Ad Hitlerum argument and the BNP is that ol&rsquo; Adolph was partly right.</p>
<p>It _is_ a struggle of races.</p>
<p>And if he had never existed, we would never have been so riven by guilt as to attempt to shrive ourselves of it by inviting the others in to prove we weren&rsquo;t genocidal maniacs of other cultures.</p>
<p>Ha ha, jokes&rsquo; on us.  We are still genocidalists and our victims are visible to us, every morning, in the mirror.  OTOH, our replacements have no racial as genetic association with us whatsoever, yet theirs&rsquo; is the &#8216;expand, annihilate, replace&rsquo; attitude which most closely mimics that of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Not the BNP.</p>
<p>WAKE UP BRITAIN.</p>
<p>Or there will be nothing left that the rest of The West willingly associates with of the original white culture that made you great to know.</p>

<p>I have to wonder if that is a thinly veiled threat that the town will suffer punitive action in some way.  Sounds like it to me!</p>
