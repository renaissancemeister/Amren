<h1><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/04/28/juan-williams-truth-trump-obama-race-card/">The Truth About Trump, Obama and the Race Card</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan Williams, Fox News, April 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The public display of the document should have ended all doubts: Barack Obama is indeed a natural born citizen of the United States and eligible to be our president.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Donald] Trump is now questioning whether the president was smart enough to write a best-selling book. He is asking if Obama is too busy playing basketball to handle the economy. Trump is doubting whether Obama had the grades to get Harvard Law School and suggesting he is just an affirmative action token.</p>
<p>It is hard not to see a pattern in these questions. The president is not smart enough to write his own book, he is not smart enough to get into Harvard, and he spends his time playing basketball. The pattern sure looks racial, smells racial, and invites Whoopi to call a spade a spade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some will undoubtedly believe the long-form birth certificate is another forgery and part of the elaborate conspiracy to conceal the &#8220;truth&#8221; about the president&rsquo;s past. Recent polls showed a quarter of all Americans doubting the President was born in the USA. Nearly half of Republicans shared that view and practically everyone in the Tea Party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The truth is that this national disgrace was never really about birth certificates or citizenship. It is about the fact that no matter what his policies  &mdash;  and there is a lot to argue with in his policies and leadership style  &mdash;  some people appear to never have accepted a president who is very smart, patriotic, hard-working and a family guy. They cannot accept that he is different from the majority of the American people in terms of his name, his life experience and yes, his race.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;birther&#8221; mindset, different equals dangerous. They can&rsquo;t say this out loud because they will then be called out for naked racism. So they have stoked doubt about the president&rsquo;s birth certificate, speaking in coded language and tacitly indulging the race-baiting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And others top Republicans and talk show hosts have winked and kept a sly smile, while asking why is it such a big deal for the president to produce the long-form of his birth certificate.</p>
<p>That disgraceful coded language led many Americans down the path of disparaging, even disliking the president on the basis of innuendo.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marc Morial, the president of the Urban League and the former mayor of New Orleans mayor, blasted Trump in an interview with Politico, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a lot of people that I&rsquo;ve talked to [who] instinctively think that he&rsquo;s using the issue as a proxy for race.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&rsquo;t know if it has resonance in the Republican Party but I certainly think it has resonance in certain far right elements of the American public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s like a modern day Salem witch trial  &mdash;  because there&rsquo;s no merit to it,&#8221; Morial contended.</p>
<p>And South Carolina Democrat Rep. James Clyburn, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, likened the birther controversy to Jackie Robinson&rsquo;s experience in Major League Baseball. He told USA Today Thursday, that Obama &#8220;has not put the issue to bed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all he did was lay out the truth for everyone to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is up to them [the &#8220;birthers&#8221;] whether they chose to accept the authenticity of the long-form birth certificate and move on from this dark period in our recent political history. Maybe we should ask for <em>their</em> birth certificates and question <em>their</em> patriotism if they fail to abandon this myth once and for all.</p>

		<p>Trump is an aging windbag, and needs a new gig. Now he&rsquo;s got hold of one, or thinks he has. This should be a lesson for all those people who think that America&rsquo;s dissatisfaction with politics is because the president is black (or half black, as the case may be.) They haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet. <br>
Obama is and has been an unmitigated disaster, but Trump would be, if anything, even worse. <br>
Remember back when everybody thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any worse than Bush II?It did. and if you think it can&rsquo;t get any worse than Obama, just vote for Trump. </p>

They reserve their nasty words for whites, and especailly conservative whites.</p>
<p>And Juan?  Thank you for existing.  You are the best example we can show to prove Fox News is just another Lame Stream Media cheerleader for the Corporate Gloabalists and only thinly attempting to appear conservative.</p>

		<p>My opinion on the whole birther thing?  I&rsquo;ve had it for quite some time, and the events of yesterday proved me almost entirely right.  Obama was holding it back, waiting to release it at such a time when doing so would accrue to his political benefit as much as possible, and while he held it under the vest, he hoped it would create a distraction big enough to take people&rsquo;s minds off his rot gut policies.  I think either Rahm or Axelrod dreamed up this Machiavellian scheme.</p>
<p>There is a popular notion making the rounds among conservative talk radio types that the birther issue came out of HRC&rsquo;s camp, as a last second hail mary throw to the end zone to derail Obama.  I don&rsquo;t believe that, because if Obama and his people had any hint that this was an HRC production, he would have produced this B/C then to discredit her forever.</p>
<p>Now the question remains:  Why now?  I thought he wasn&rsquo;t going to pull this hare out of his hat until the heat of the general election season next year.  He had some reason for using this ace in the whole now, when it doesn&rsquo;t appear that all the chips are on the table.  (Remember, he only got to play this ace in the hole once.)  I think Zimbabwe Ben Bernanke&rsquo;s presser yesterday had something to do with it, because I think that&rsquo;s the start of a number of fiscal and economic policy changes that are emblematic of, and will indeed cause, some heavy weather ahead.  Mark Levin used the phrase &#8220;economic repression,&#8221; i.e. the Feds trying to force or trick as many people and institutions as possible into buying T-Bills, which they are loath to do now.  It&rsquo;s too long to explain, but it could be very disastrous in the long run.</p>
<p>On his college transcripts   &mdash;   I doubt they&rsquo;re very good.  If they were, he would have released them by now, just to shove &#8220;how smart he is&#8221; in all our faces.</p>

		<p>Donald Trump is far too smart to believe this. Does he not believe that the Clinton or McCain would have made this case in 2008. This would have been the great October Surprise!</p>
<p>I think he is either secretly working for Obama or he is trying to generate more publicity for his future enterprises. Otherwise, he is is being very foolish.</p>

		<p>  I have seen one which seems equally valid from Mombasa,Kenya.<br>
 NOW-How about the Constitutional requirement that ALL parents MUST have been born in US also..I seem to recall that this is a Constitutional requirment.Even George Washington had this problem when it was all written up to help ensure distance from European influence&hellip;Am I right here..If so then Mr.Trump had better bring this issue up,as this is far more important .All his birth certificate shows me is he is the son of a Kenyan who was already married to one or more women in Kenya..I think this is called Bigamy in US laws..Also the question of his legal status while in Indonesia..Trump has several Trump Cards left..</p>

		<p>The whole &#8220;birther&#8221; issue is part of a long series of Obama hiding every vestige of his past. Obama has only now had his hand forced and had to throw something out. He ran on a promise of having the most &#8220;open&#8221; administration in history and then his first act as President was to lock up his past via executive order:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/Sma25" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/Sma25</a></p>
<p>But that was only the beginning. Obama has kept all of his records hidden and continues to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/81qts" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/81qts</a></p>
<p>If Obama were white, he would&rsquo;ve never got past the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. Someone would&rsquo;ve held his feet to the fire and forced the issue back then. Instead, the milquetoast McCain treated him with kid gloves, and he slithered his way into the White House. I for one am glad that someone is making him come up with the truth about his past, and whether it&rsquo;s Donald Trump or not makes little difference to me. To have virtually all of your past locked up goes way beyond any privacy issues and makes any rational person wonder what exactly the guy is hiding. It smells just as bad-or worse- in 2011 as it did in 2008. </p>

		<p>I always figured he was born in the US and that the birth certificate thing was a distraction from the real issue that he is a citizen of Indonesia.  His mother married and Indonesian.  The Indonesian step-father adopted Barry Sotero, making the Indonesian Barry&rsquo;s LEGAL father.  Barry went to school in Indonesian.  I would bet dollars to donuts that he either became an Indonesian citizen because his step-father adopted him or through Indonesia&rsquo;s naturalization process.</p>
<p>By focusing on Barry&rsquo;s LFBC and the British Subject status of his bio-father everyone has avoided the real reason he is not eligible for the US presidency: his citizenship was renounced during the 1960s!  Distract a dumbed down public.  </p>
<p>Our Constitution is a meaningless piece of parchment.</p>

		<p>Another black espousing more black nonsense and silliness.  If barry had the document all along, he had a DUTY to disclose to the public of which he is a public servant to.  It is the public that pays his salary and ALLOWS him to sit in the White House.  Barry fancies himself above the people who he serves.  It took a Donald Trump to make him feel anxious of not disclosing a document that a majority of the public requested for so long.</p>

		<p>I really doubt the authenticity of that document.  For one thing, there is no seal.  The hospital given never went by that name.  I&rsquo;ve heard someone else say that Kenya wasn&rsquo;t even known as &#8220;Kenya&#8221; until 1963.</p>
<p>If you search the Web archives, you can find articles about &#8220;Kenya-born Obama.&#8221;</p>

<p>Call a spade a spade?  WOW!..If any White ever said that we would sure be in trouble, wouldn&rsquo;t we, folks?  As for Whoopi, there is definitely something wrong with that &#8220;woman&#8221;&hellip;Have you seen her? She looks horrible and dresses like a man and her hair&hellip;.well I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>BTW, Juan, we have to speak in &#8220;code&#8221; since you people have been granted &#8220;protected group rights&#8221; by our own government. Seems though, that you blacks can say anything you want about Whites, even about killing them all off the planet, and that is a-okay, right, Juan? Blacks don&rsquo;t know when to shut up and someday it will bite them back.</p>

<p>Well unfortunately Comrade Juan, it was members of his own family in Kenya that also stoked the flames of this pyro-maniacal myth!</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is &ldquo;naked racism&rdquo; is not what is occurring here, but a healthy awakening in the white majority that something odd and alien has taken hold in our country and runs it. It is a genocidal quasi-religious dogma known as multiculturalism, and both you and Comrade General Secretary BO are direct symptoms of it. The ever enriching blacks that are affirmatively fast-tracked into positions of influence and power, simply to lecture &ldquo;whitey&rdquo; about how &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; you are because of our &ldquo;naked racism&rdquo; that is so &ldquo;institutionalized&rdquo; we can&rsquo;t even see it. </p>
<p>That the failures and shortcomings of Obama&rsquo;s presidency, or even your own screeds, are to be found in the individuals producing them never occurs to you!</p>
<p>That is an almost abominably &ldquo;bigoted&rdquo; prospect even to be considered, right?</p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>I was never on board with the Obama birth issue, but I will defend those who were/are against charges of &#8220;RACISM.&#8221;  The &#8220;birthers&#8221; also questioned John Kerry&rsquo;s service in Vietnam.  That was offensive to his supporters.  But it wasn&rsquo;t called &#8220;RACIST.&#8221; The real RACISTS today are those who insist that we cannot legitimately question Obama&rsquo;s background because of Obama&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>Juan should set aside his fixation with Obama&rsquo;s race long enough to consider the possibility that a white president with a heretofore ambiguous birth record would also be questioned about it by his political enemies.  Blacks who themselves owe their jobs to Affirmative Action and who demand preferential treatment from whites are in no credible position to criticize whites for being racially biased anyway.<br>

		<p> If the belief that maybe there is something fishy about Barack Obama was preposterous in reality, it wouldn&rsquo;t have so many people believing in it.</p>
<p> Blacks have yelled &#8220;Racism!&#8221; &#8220;Racist code words!&#8221; and the like until they have literally worn them out, and made them meaningless. They claim that many White people &#8220;can&rsquo;t stand&#8221; the fact that there is a black man as president of the United States. What is never mentioned   &mdash;   and I&rsquo;m amazed that no conservative seems to have brought this up in a debate   &mdash;   is that many more Whites would have voted for a black man like, say, J.C. Watts, or Thomas Sowell (if he were younger and at all interested in running for president), than the 43 percent who cast their ballots for Obama.</p>
<p> The thing about Barack Obama is that, he seemed to go out of his way to set the teeth of a lot of White people on edge, in a way that conservative black politicians do not. He cozied up to aging &rsquo;60s radicals and White-hating black preachers. He claims to be a Christian, but may have been a Muslim in his early life, with all the suspicion that engenders among many Americans.</p>
<p> He&rsquo;s of mixed race, which I think many Whites still find off-putting. I realize he had nothing to say about that, but he seems to identify entirely with the race of his black father, who abandoned Barack and his mother when he was very young, and to pretty much ignore his White side, like it is an embarrassment he would like to forget.</p>
<p> Will the release of the purported birth certificate put the suspicions about Obama to rest? I doubt it. There are just too many of them.</p>

		<p>I very much hope it is true that questions about Obama are linked to current racial issues, rather than being unique to the President. I would be dismayed if many whites believed Obama is foreign born. But if all the fuss is really a way for whites to use the dreaded N-word without overwhelming stigma, then at least we retain healthy instincts. With time they may reassert themselves, and we can rejoin the political battle over our future in America.</p>

<p>What do you mean, &#8220;national disgrace&#8221;? It was a perfectly legitimate concern. </p>
<p>The only reason the doubt  even existed was because the Big O consistently refused to show his birth certificiate, which stoked some very real doubts about his qualifications for the presidency. He could easily have nipped this  in the bud by producing the certificate and ended the whole matter.  Why didn&rsquo;t he?  Why did he delay this long?  Why the evasiveness?</p>
<p>It should have been no big deal. Obama made it a big deal.</p>
<p>What a slanted piece of yellow journalism!  This article is the disgrace.   Pure garbage. And do note, all you worshippers of Murdoch publications, that this garbage is coming from your beloved Fox News.</p>

		<p>For all of the comments saying he finally produced his &#8220;birth certificate&#8221;, he did not.  He produced just what is shown on this page, his &#8220;certificate of live birth&#8221;, not his BIRTH CERTIFICATE (with a seal), like the one the rest of us have to show at the DMV, etc.</p>
<p>The comment about Kenya not being called Kenya until 1963, well, that&rsquo;s very interesting and I hope someone will research that further&hellip;I will be. Also, the comment about Indonesia is right on. He was adopted by and Indonesian and went to a religious school there, and from what I have read he had to have renounced his foreign citizenship to go to that kind of school. As well, I have read that since his father was not a US citizen, his mother (who names their daughter STANLEY anyway?) was not old enough (I think she would have to have been 21 at minimum) to confer citizenship on him.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this president, from all of the facts I know, is illegitimate. If they want to call me a racist for that, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

		<p>Thou shalt not criticize our genius president.  Remember that he is the only presidential candidate that knew that there are really 57 states instead of 50.  Most less well educated presidents did not know this.  Obama was also the president who exposed the foot chopping doctor/insurance company link.  Who would have thought that American doctors were actually needlessly cutting off people&rsquo;s feet so that they could get more insurance money. I tell you, after I heard that I cancelled my doctors appointments and sought out the professional expertise of an African witchdoctor.  </p>

		<p>Natural born is the issue, meaning both parents must be natural born Americans.  The founders didn&rsquo;t want someone with competing priorities (ie parents and kin in another country) for the highest office in the land.  It&rsquo;s quiet a simple concept, except for the MSM.</p>
<p>Also, did you notice on the birth certificate &#8220;African&#8221; as the race of the father?  In 1961, I think it would have been &#8220;negro&#8221;.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a certain amount of truth in what Juan Williams is saying, though to suggest that BO didn&rsquo;t have a huge (skinny?) leg up on all similarly situated white applicants to Harvard is absurd.  </p>
<p>Obama has made a whole career of never having had gainful employment.  He clearly has no understanding of economics, the structure of our government, the Constitution, or practically anything else one would assume any candidate for mayor of a medium-size town would have.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s entirely a media creation, something which would be impossible for any white man, and certainly for any black man displaying conservative principles.  Dr. Thomas Sowell and Dr. Walter Williams come immediately to mind, men of extraordinary intellect and clarity of vision. The MSM sneeringly dismisses them as Uncle Toms.</p>

		<p>I think Trump is asking legitimate questions, it&rsquo;s just that they are not particularly important questions. And it has nothing to do with race: no one, including Trump, thinks Obama is not a very smart man - he clearly is intelligent, more so than W Bush. He&rsquo;s just a terrible president in many respects. I doubt too Obama had the grades to get into a Harvard, but the more important question is why :</p>
<p><i> &#8220;Percy Sutton, NYC political icon in the African American community and lawyer for Malcolm X, told a NY 1 news reporter that Dr. Khalid al Mansour solicited a favor and a recommendation on behalf of Barack Hussein Obama in order to secure Barack&rsquo;s entry into Harvard. Sutton was approached by Mansour on Obama&rsquo;s behalf, to secure (procure?) Barack&rsquo;s admission into Harvard from the second college, Occcidental. </i> &#8220;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fine with being racist. In fact, one direction society HAS to go to survive is to detoxify this word.  Somehow, a couple of generations believe it is more evil to be racist than to be a murderer, a thief, a pedophile, or a traitor. We&rsquo;ve all seen lives destroyed by the simple accusation of &#8220;racism.&#8221; In fact, racism is about No. 735th on the devil&rsquo;s list of sins. Mostly, it&rsquo;s just handy labeling in times of anger, when the driver who cut you off is of a different color. Or it&rsquo;s routine workplace friction, utterly banal except when one of the participants is an American black and his or her paranoia, carefully nurtured by liberals, is set off crazily.  It&rsquo;s nothing more than that, and it should be forgotten as quickly as it occurs. THEN we can get to the deeper problem of dealing with this 13 per cent segment of population that contributes nothing, squanders money others have earned at staggering rates, is slow to learn, quick to misbehave, and costly beyond measure. They ain&rsquo;t no cheap date, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately the fact is Obama grew up in America (and yes, also Indonesia), was educated at American universities, and has a political viewpoint millions of Americans agree with.</p>
<p>This is the problem!  The socialists, black advocates, and feminists have had a large enough influence on American society that the traditional, ideal, white American is no longer just the norm.  Now, any agrieved group has legitimacy to flount their past discrimination as a way to stick it to the white man and take the nation built by his white ancestors.</p>
<p>The &#8220;birther&#8221; nonsense made conservatives look stupid and allowed liberals another opportunity to cry &#8220;racist.&#8221;  Furthermore, with unemployment at 9%, gas prices at $4/gallon, and food prices skyrocketing, an unconstitutional war in Libya&hellip; Obama gets his distraction.  </p>
<p>This whole issue is a sad microcosm of modern-day America.  White Americans, after years of concessions, allow the racial propaganda to seep through society to the point where a black, Marxist college professor becomes president.  Then, instead of using intelligent discourse to win back moderate whites alienated with the black man&rsquo;s presidency, they jump into conspiracy theories that only serve to legitimize him again.  Meanwhile, with the birther circus and sluggish economy going on, the Mexican border is still wide open as whites become less and less&hellip;</p>

		<p>With todays technology, you can forge just about any document you want. Do I believe Obama was born in Hawaii? I don&rsquo;t care at this point. It&rsquo;s too late now. If he wasn&rsquo;t born in the U.S. then he has already broken the law by allowing himself to be  elected President. Aided and abetted by a stupidly liberal mass media and a whole host of others that could care less about the laws of this nation. If he was born here, I don&rsquo;t like him as a President. And it has nothing to do with his race. I think he is a socialist who does not have this country&rsquo;s best interests at heart.</p>
<p>Juan Williams is just playing the race card, as usual, to distract us from the real issues. Him and his ilk use emotional labels like &#8220;birthers&#8221; and, God forbid, the ultimate epithet coming from the likes of them, &#8220;racists&#8221;!</p>

		<p>Obama has probably just fueled the fire by releasing this document after two and a half years of concealment and millions in staving off lawsuits.  The move simply begs the question of why and still reeks of something rotten in Denmark.  Supporters who thundered that the other certification is the only document available have now been proven to be lying or badly mistaken.  <br>
And as to the demand for release of Obama&rsquo;s grades and papers, his supporters have brought this on by their claims that he&rsquo;s the smartest President ever or usually the smartest guy in the room and so on.  When you claim to be smarter than Clinton or Jefferson, you&rsquo;re asking for it.  The leftists believed that no one would question the intelligence of a black, and now that someone has, they&rsquo;re scrambling.  And the truth is that most Americans are race-realists and don&rsquo;t care how long and loud anyone howls &#8220;Racism!&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I find the personal antipathy towards Obama from the populist right to be most off-putting. He appears to be a bright enough fellow, certainly the equal of many of his white predecessors in an office for intellectual brilliance has never been a prerequisite. The Obamas have lived their lives in accordance with white norms- Barack, college and law school graduate, married to his one wife, mother of his children, Michelle, same education, from an intact family, still married to her only husband, father of her children- yet the rabble simply piles scorn on them, with a view not to political opposition within the Constitutional framework, but rather to a stripping-away of Obama&rsquo;s legitamacy as our duly-elected head of state.<br>
The Obamas are what we should want our black population to be, or at least, what we&rsquo;ve always said we want them to be.<br>
With the treatment of Obama, I can understand why a bright young black boy might just give up, play basketball, smoke crack, and impregnate a dozen or two baby mommas. The subtext of all this criticism from the low Tories is whatever a black man achieves, he&rsquo;s never anything but a n_____ to us.</p>

I contend he is milking this issue for political gain, hoping to make his enemies look marginalized now that he has finally capitulated to their previous demands.</p>
<p>I suspect he really was born in Hawaii and is hiding is his Columbia years and that he was likely propped up by the CIA/Business International and groomed by left-wing globalist foundations instead of being a candidate that did this all himself from humble beginnings.

		<p>The real story may the cultural decay in America by way of which traditional safeguards against the evil side of human nature are not merely ignored, but scorned when they do arise.  In fact, the issue re birth is one of certification/VERIFICATION.  As President Reagan said of making agreements with the then-USSR:  &#8220;Trust by VERIFY&#8221;.  If BHO were selling 40 acres (no mule included ) and offering a quit claim deed (as one supposes he would ), he&rsquo;d assert any buyer was paranoid and a conspiracy nut if he/she wished instead to have a warranty deed.  With the genes of Barack Obama, Sr. and Stanley Armour Dunham cascading within him, the President as a &#8220;Trust Me Figure&#8221; is a comic act, at best.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no expert on the definition of a natural born citizen, but the link above is a book-length exploration of the topic. Unfortunately, the Constitution does not define what it means by the term &#8220;natural born citizen&#8221;. The relevant section in Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution reads: &#8220;No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of the President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the above book, but in skimming it the author appears to question the natural born Citizenship of not only Barack Obama, but also John McCain, who was born in Panama. The next time someone claims that no white Presidential candidate ever had to defend his natural born citizenship, remind them of John McCain, who faced this very question as early as did Obama. </p>

<p>Not the same question.  McCain wasn&rsquo;t born in Panama, he was born in the Panama Canal Zone, an American military base, to two American parents.  As futile as the concept is of the Federal courts nullifying the Obama Presidency, the concept of them doing it to McCain had he won was even more silly.  He was the son and grandson of very high level Naval officers (both named John Sidney McCain).  No way the courts were going to turn him out.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Juan, your first sentence is wrong. Obama is NOT a natural born citizen. He&rsquo;s admitted as much himself. The Constitution states a &ldquo;natural born&rdquo; citizens is one whose parents were born in this country. Look it up.&#8221; </p>
<p>This post is correct. </p>
<p>The place of birth is a diversion.<br>
&#8220;natural born citizen&#8221; is a special category that applies only to the president and VP because he could become president. It comes from Laws of Nations #212. His CLB confirms his father was an alien, therefore he is not a &#8220;natural born citizen&#8221;, even though he may in fact be a &#8220;citizen&#8221;.<br>

<p><br>
True.  The Canal Zone was considered American territory. (Though admittedly not one of the states,  which makes it somewhat  iffy.)</p>
<p>Of course, when the Constitution  was written, there were no  American bases scattered around the world.  So that eventuality wasn&rsquo;t provided for.</p>

		<p>I see, if you question Obama about anything you are a racist.  Simple.  Does that mean if Obama question W&rsquo;s policies Obama is a racist?</p>

		<p>I think there is something underlying all of this discussion. This would be the possibility that a pedigree and lineage was set up for Ann Dunham&rsquo;s child because she and the child&rsquo;s biological father were considered assets.</p>
<p>Later on, the child turned out to a considerable asset, and he was given a boost a critical times in his life. Or so the theory goes. The only documented &#8220;boost&#8221; was his placement into Harvard Law, when some prominent and well-connected individuals encouraged and supported his application.</p>
<p>In his political career, he promoted himself through his own initiative to a great extent. In his presidential aspirations, he started out with the support of the Daley machine, of course. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want a president who came out of their own organization?</p>
<p>Is it possible that Barack Obama Sr. was not Barack Obama II&rsquo;s father? Could be. The lineage of his two immediate predecessors has been questioned with some credibility as well. Could Barack Obama II actually have been born some months before his August 4, 1961 birthdate. Not impossible. It would have been no problem for an intelligence service to arrange a birth date other than the actual one.</p>
<p>I have been told Kapiolani was a birth center where births often were attended by midwives. What about the doctor who signed the birth certificate? Maybe it was common practice to have doctor sign the birth certificate even when the doctor was not present at the birth, but only &#8220;in the building&#8221; or on call.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know. Do we? Maybe his citizenship is not in question, but his true political heritage is. It is an issue.</p>

		<p>Even back in 1964, some on the Left suggested (wrongly, of course) that Barry Goldwater was ineligible to be President because he was born in Arizona Territory, before it became a state. Obama is certainly not unique as far as questions about eligibility are concerned. Using Juan&rsquo;s leftylogic, I guess those people questioning Goldwater&rsquo;s must have been racists who hated white people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In the &ldquo;birther&rdquo; mindset, different equals dangerous. They can&rsquo;t say this out loud because they will then be called out for naked racism. &#8220;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s false, no matter HOW MANY &#8216;versions&rsquo; or &#8216;long forms&rsquo; you produce. You Tube and the Net already have tens of articles calling the BC a FRAUD.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not WORTHY of the Office, and by God, I am PROUD to be an American racist&hellip;.</p>
<p>Like Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Lindbergh, and all the rest.<br>
Like Clark Gable, if someone wants to call me a racist, I merely respond, &#8220;Frankly, my dear, I don&rsquo;t give a &hellip;..&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bring it on, bubba!<br>
&#8216;Give me liberty, or give me Death.&rsquo; &#8216;For I know whom I have believed and am persuaded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a call to war- with knives and clubs. JUST LIKE THE OBAMANATION said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is never mentioned  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m amazed that no conservative seems to have brought this up in a debate  &mdash;  is that many more Whites would have voted for a black man like, say, J.C. Watts, or Thomas Sowell (if he were younger and at all interested in running for president), than the 43 percent who cast their ballots for Obama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man&rsquo;s entirely a media creation, something which would be impossible for any white man, and certainly for any black man displaying conservative principles. Dr. Thomas Sowell and Dr. Walter Williams come immediately to mind, men of extraordinary intellect and clarity of vision. The MSM sneeringly dismisses them as Uncle Toms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ugggghhh.  I really am tired of certain elements on the left and so-called right who play this &#8220;I&rsquo;ll pit my black pet against yours&#8221; game.  This is the kind of swill that&rsquo;s fit for National Review, The Onion, MSNBC or FOX News blogging.  You want to keep us moored at the port of multiculturalism while the rest of us want to cast off the lines and get underway. Why don&rsquo;t you just get off at the gangplank? </p>

This Osama excuse me I meant to type OBAMA is one Major Prank pulled on the American public. Without A.A. he would be doing just what so many AA people do, work in the Welfare Office for 35 K a year?</p>
