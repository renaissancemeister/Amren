	<p> <i>Southern Africa is the most acute and dramatic example of the 
worldwide struggle of white resistance against dispossession. What does 
the future hold for white South Africans, specifically for the 
Afrikaners? Their ancestors built South Africa; they are rooted to the 
land, and cannot easily leave it as the British and other whites do. In 
this extraordinary two-part essay, an Afrikaner weeps for the land and 
people he loves.</i> </p>
        <p> <span class="dropcap">W</span>ho are the Afrikaners, or 
Boers as they are often called? A hundred years ago, Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle, the popular British writer of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, 
asked much the same question in his book <i>The Great Boer War</i>: </p>

        <blockquote> &#8220;Look at the map of South Africa, and there, in the
 very centre of the British possessions, like the stone in a peach, lies
 the great stretch of the two republics, a mighty domain for so small a 
people. How came they there? Who are these Teutonic folk who have 
burrowed so deeply into Africa?&#8221; </blockquote>
        <p> Elsewhere in the same book he answered his own question: </p>
        <blockquote> &#8220;Take a community of Dutchmen of the type of those 
who defended themselves for fifty years against all the power of Spain 
at a time when Spain was the greatest power in the world. Intermix with 
them a strain of those inflexible French Huguenots who gave up home and 
fortune and left their country for ever at the time of the revocation of
 the Edict of Nantes. The product must obviously be one of the most 
rugged, virile, unconquerable races ever seen upon earth. Take this 
formidable people and train them for seven generations in constant 
warfare against savage men and ferocious beasts, in circumstances under 
which no weakling could survive, place them so that they acquire 
exceptional skill with weapons and in horsemanship, give them a country 
which is eminently suited to the tactics of the huntsman, the marksman, 
and the rider. Then, finally, put a finer temper upon their military 
qualities by a dour fatalistic Old Testament religion and an ardent and 
consuming patriotism. Combine all these qualities and all these impulses
 in one individual, and you have the modern Boer   &mdash;   the most formidable 
antagonist who ever crossed the path of Imperial Britain.&#8221; </blockquote>

        <p> A hundred years later, there is still a grain of truth in 
this description. Afrikaners still hunt; many accountants, lawyers and 
businessmen would rather buy a game farm than a yacht. They may collect 
antiques or rare books, but also rhinoceri, African buffalo and other 
game. They still go on treks to tame large stretches of African bush 
single-handedly. </p>
        <p> It was these qualities that gave rise to a multifaceted 
agriculture in one of the driest countries in the world, where only six 
percent of the land is arable. In the Karoo, for example, which is 
similar to the Arizona desert, Afrikaners raise sheep on land most 
people would consider worthless. Blacks have never settled in the Karoo 
because they would not survive. </p>
        <p> Afrikaners are a strong people, physically as large as most 
Dutch or North Germans, and resilient in the face of many hardships, 
such as the periodic droughts that wrack the country and ruin their 
crops. During the Angolan war in the 1980s, a force of never more than 
3,000 white South African soldiers commanded by a few stern but 
charismatic Afrikaner generals stopped an army of 45,000 Angolans, 
Russians and Cubans at the Namibian border. Because of the Western arms 
boycott against South Africa, the Russians even had air superiority, but
 a small Boer force held them off through sheer courage and creative 
battle plans. Casualty figures now emerging from that war, cross-checked
 against numbers from Havana and Moscow, show an almost unbelievable 
number of enemy killed for every South African who fell. It is with the 
same grim determination that they now bury the dead in what amounts to 
an undeclared race war waged against them on farms, street corners, and 
in their suburban homes, where they are robbed, raped and killed. </p>

        <p> The English South African novelist and 1991 Nobel prize 
winner Nadine Gordimer made a career out of caricaturing Afrikaners as 
oafish racists living out on farms, where they drink brandy, torture 
natives, and practice incest. In at least one respect she was right. 
Like the patricians of republican Rome or the peasant famers of Western 
Europe from whom they sprang, the Boers derive their strength from the 
land. The word &#8220;Boer&#8221; means farmer. The stoic values praised by Vergil 
in his so-called bucolic poetry are much the same as Afrikaner values, a
 sort of pious conservatism that obeys God, respects work, and embraces 
nature. </p>
        <p> A number of Afrikaners have made their mark outside Africa: 
Oscar-winning Hollywood actress Charlize Theron, international models 
like Minki van der Westhuizen, whose pin-ups graced the US tanks in 
Iraq, and opera singer Mimi Coertse, who was the lead soprano for the 
Viennese State Opera for 20 years in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s. Johan Botha, 
the current male lead of the Viennese Opera, is booked out years in 
advance in all the major operatic centers. The physical beauty of many 
Afrikaner women is a constant source of wonder to many. Even Miss 
Gordimer has admitted as much. </p>
        <p> Back in South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki once famously 
referred to the country as &#8220;two nations   &mdash;   the one rich and white, and 
the other black and poor.&#8221; He was not entirely correct. There is no such
 thing as a white nation in South Africa, only the Afrikaner nation, 
along with a motley collection of English-speakers, Portuguese, Greeks, 
Jews, Germans, Italians, and the like. Under the old, so-called 
apartheid government, all young white men did military service, during 
which they were trained not only to be soldiers, but also in Afrikaans 
and patriotism; there was then a kind of white nation in the making. 
Now, the dominant blacks have adopted English, and are actively trying 
to undermine Afrikaans and the nation it represents. </p>
        <p> <b>The Afrikaner Nation</b> </p>
        <p> The sense of community one experiences among Afrikaners, at 
their schools, churches, cultural societies, arts festivals and 
concerts, is completely different from that among the English whites. 
The English South African, apart from the sizeable number who have 
intermarried with Afrikaners or been integrated to the point of becoming
 Afrikaners themselves, is an atomised individual, linked by his 
language and outlook not to Africa but to that powerful Anglo-American 
civilization that still radiates its influence from across the oceans. 
As such, he is fascinated by the model of the sovereign individual who 
wants to get rich quickly, and buy a better house with better security 
in a more lavish gated community. He is essentially apolitical and 
adapts to circumstances. He thinks he can outwit the black government in
 a double game in which he pretends to be in favor of affirmative 
action. He will play the game, get a black partner to stay in business, 
and mouth the multicultural clichés of his English newspaper that 
already has a black editor, while privately voicing his misgivings and 
making sure his passport is ready for a quick exit in case things go 
wrong. </p>
        <p> In the rest of Africa, including the ex-Rhodesia (now 
Zimbabwe), which once had a white community of 300,000, the sovereign 
individual model has not worked. One has only to read V.S. Naipaul&rsquo;s <i>A Bend in the River,</i> set in the Congo, to get a feel for the vulnerability of atomized expatriots to the radical caprice of African politics. </p>
        <p> Afrikaners are not sovereign individuals, generally 
speaking. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they went 
through a great Romantic movement, a flowering of literature, 
translations, music and historical reflection that bound them into a 
nation of the European type, a cultural nation or <i>kultuurvolk</i> as they like to call themselves. </p>
        <p> This explains the extraordinary level of Afrikaner cohesion 
in the face of intense official hostility. In South Africa today, it is 
virtually illegal to maintain or run any institution except a private 
family without it being, in official parlance, &#8220;demographically 
representative.&#8221; The ANC hires thousands of inspectors to harass 
schools, universities, businesses   &mdash;   even family businesses   &mdash;   sports 
clubs, trade unions, newspapers, radio stations, hospitals and clinics 
about their racial composition. Strictly speaking, it is illegal to 
employ whites unless they make up less than 10 percent of the payroll. 
An Afrikaans-language radio station, Radio Pretoria, lost its license 
because it employed only whites, and is now in a major legal battle to 
survive. </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th> One should not underestimate the thousand little resistances carried out every day. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Yet one should not underestimate the thousand little 
resistances carried out every day, in schools, companies, hospitals and 
elsewhere. Whole suburbs in Pretoria are policed not by the South 
African Police Department   &mdash;   completely black, with corrupt cops and 
hardened criminals in its ranks   &mdash;   but by an all-white private security 
company consisting, as one satisfied female resident put it, of 
&#8220;handsome young Boers.&#8221; Their patrols ensure a level of security 
unheard-of in crime-ridden South Africa. </p>
        <p> Despite the laws and harassment, many people get away with 
running ethnic Afrikaner or white businesses. Suburban houses often 
shelter thriving companies employing up to a dozen white people who ply 
their trades, unbeknown to inspectors. Every remaining Afrikaans school 
outside the Cape Province with its large Afrikaans-speaking Coloured 
population is still 99 percent white, as are the Afrikaans classes at 
bilingual schools. Government incompetence, predictable in most African 
countries, makes for a less than perfect system. To police a white 
population of six million people actively going about their daily 
business is an arduous task, especially when two thirds of them enjoy a 
distinct culture the government can penetrate only with difficulty. </p>
        <p> There are other bastions of Afrikanerdom. On Easter Friday 
last year, I took my children to a church service, accompanied by a 
classical music program. The Reformed Church on the outskirts of 
Pretoria was packed to capacity with about 1,500 people   &mdash;   not a single 
black face among them. According to the mores of the new South Africa, 
where mixing is <i>de rigeur </i>and legally enforced, this gathering was scandalous. Afterwards people drank tea or coffee and had <i>melktert</i> [milk tarts] and <i>koeksisters</i> [a fried dough dessert], Boer delicacies found everywhere in South Africa. </p>
        <p> My children&rsquo;s school still bears some of the marks of nationhood. It used to be known as a <i>laerskool,</i>
 the equivalent of grade school, and instruction was exclusively in 
Afrikaans. Under official threat, it has now become a &#8220;parallel medium&#8221; 
school, and a third of the children take classes in English. During the 
prize-giving ceremony, the names are called from the Afrikaans-speaking 
class, with the children standing on stage in a neat row in their school
 uniforms. The surnames are all familiar Afrikaner ones, deriving from 
our Dutch, French Huguenot, German and Scottish forebears. Further 
examination of the fresh young faces and healthy bodies shows that at 
least half if not more of the children are blond. An extraordinarily 
high number have sparkling blue eyes. In fact, standing next to the 
English-medium class in the same age group, they seem almost like a 
caricature of the Aryan ideal. </p>

        <p> When the &#8220;English&#8221; names are called out, a multicultural 
array of children saunters onto the stage, some of them white 
English-speakers, others Africans with names that are difficult for 
their white teacher to pronounce, a few Indians and mixed-race Coloreds,
 a Portuguese or a Greek, as well as a few Afrikaner children whose 
parents have put them in the English-speaking class because they have 
succumbed to the fallacy that &#8220;the future is English.&#8221; The ceremony is 
punctuated by performances provided almost exclusively by the Afrikaner 
children, including a piece by Bach for piano and cello, played 
faultlessly by further caricatures of the Aryan ideal. </p>
        <p> It is hard not to smile at some of the South African 
realities known only to the Afrikaner. The results of the matric 
examination, our equivalent of the high school diploma, were published 
at the end of December 2003. On the front pages of the English-language 
newspapers there were photographs of smiling black students celebrating 
their successes. One African girl in Gauteng province, which surrounds 
Johannesburg, received distinction   &mdash;   meaning marks of above 80 percent   &mdash;  
 in five subjects. In fact, standards have been lowered to the point 
that it is almost impossible for anyone who takes the trouble to write 
the examination to fail the matric, and getting a &#8220;distinction&#8221; is not 
what it used to be. Still, reading the Johannesburg <i>Star,</i> one 
would think the province teems with black geniuses, all personally 
congratulated by the provincial Minister of Education. One wonders what 
happened to all those Afrikaner children. </p>
        <p> Then you buy the Afrikaans-language <i>Beeld,</i> and the 
truth emerges. Here there are rankings and statistics, and more 
pictures, this time of a youngster named Riaan Swanepoel from the 
Menlopark <i>Hoërskool</i> in Pretoria who got not five, not 10, but <i>19 </i>distinctions.
 Of the 10 children in Gauteng province who got the highest overall 
marks in the matric exam, seven are Afrikaners from Afrikaans-language 
schools. Afrikaners probably represent 10 percent or fewer of the 
children in the province, yet won 70 percent of the top academic honors.
 </p>
        <p> One discovers that the government&rsquo;s game of subverting 
education so that just about everyone can pass, has started a new game 
among the highly competitive Afrikaans high schools of Pretoria: making 
the bright children take not just the six mandatory subjects, but 10, 15
 or even 20 to see if they can shoot the lights out by getting more than
 80 percent in all of them. </p>
        <table class="boxright">

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Of course, eventually the South African government will 
abolish exams and grades entirely, as they have already done for younger
 children. Afrikaans schools are now developing an underground system of
 traditional teaching methods, including grades, while keeping the 
official paperwork for &#8220;outcomes-based education&#8221; and &#8220;continuous 
assessment,&#8221; as if the schools were really following official edicts. At
 one major high school in Pretoria, the teachers recently had to work 
through the night to prepare phony paperwork for a government 
inspection. The officials left none the wiser, unaware that the infernal
 system that produces straight-A students who play chess, the piano, and
 that &#8220;aggressive, white male-dominated, racist sport, rugby&#8221; continues 
unabated. </p>
        <p> But can this game of hide-and-seek continue? At the start of
 the 2004 academic year, there were more attempts to swamp the remaining
 Afrikaans-language schools with black students demanding instruction in
 English, even at schools with no space for them. It may be that in a 
few years&rsquo; time, Afrikaners will have to take their children out of 
school altogether; many already prefer home schooling or private 
microschools where technology is used to teach in innovative ways. </p>
        <p> <b>Language</b> </p>
        <p> Like so many nations, Afrikaners are bound together by their
 language, Afrikaans. The old South Africa was a bilingual country with 
English dominant in business, and Afrikaans used in government, in 
parliament, the military, the police and the education system. 
Afrikaners had firmly-established Afrikaans-speaking institutions at all
 levels. Now, because race-mixing and the Africanisation of the national
 culture   &mdash;   if such a thing exists   &mdash;   are official policy, breaking down 
the Afrikaner identity is a top priority. Government spokesmen rage that
 Afrikaans &#8220;is a barrier,&#8221; and they are right. </p>
        <p> Although English is spoken as a mother tongue by only three 
million people (including more than one million Indians) out of 46 
million, it is the official medium of &#8220;nation-building,&#8221; that forlorn 
dream of every African government since the 1950s. Afrikaans is widely 
spoken as a lingua franca by about 15 million people in South Africa and
 Namibia, especially outside the major cities, but it does not attract 
Africans, who see English as the instrument of power and prestige. Most 
South African blacks are so bewitched by the alleged power of English 
that when they visit Europe for the first time they are surprised to 
find that the people of France, Germany or Italy speak their own 
languages, not English. </p>
        <table class="boxcenter">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/ar/2004/05/MAPsml.JPG" alt="map of South Africa" width="432" height="369" /> </td>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> The presence of an imperial language like English, with its 
global Hollywood culture appealing to the multicultural masses, sets the
 Afrikaners apart. Blacks avoid Afrikaans institutions, which they see 
as ethnically exclusive. Most of the black elite that rule in Pretoria 
prefer to commute from houses in Johannesburg 25 miles away, since they 
still think of the capital as an unwelcoming, Afrikaner city. The black 
attraction to English is driving some English-speaking whites to 
Afrikaans. In some towns on the East Rand, where middle class 
English-speaking whites cannot afford private schools, they have started
 sending their children to Afrikaans government schools to escape from 
their own English-speaking schools, which have been swamped by blacks. </p>
        <p> (The same thing is happening in Brussels, where 
French-speaking Walloons have traditionally looked down on the Flemish, 
but now send their children to Dutch-language schools where they can 
still get a European education. The French-speaking schools have been 
taken over by North and West African immigrants, who want to learn an 
imperial language rather than Dutch. White-minority languages may become
 a haven for maintaining Western identities and education standards, 
both in Europe and in South Africa.) </p>
        <p> Afrikaans may be a barrier to blacks, but there are also 
racial barriers and divisions within Afrikaans. Eighty percent of the 
four million mixed-race Coloureds speak Afrikaans, sometimes very 
beautifully in rural areas, but since 1994 the government has pushed for
 the Creolization of Afrikaans. For the government and media, speaking 
or writing &#8220;proper Afrikaans,&#8221; the standard, white, Germanic version of 
the language, is a sign of political conservatism and opposition to race
 mixing. </p>
        <p> The new model is a debased version spoken by urban Coloreds,
 mixed with English words and expressions. Subverting Afrikaans and 
turning it into a Creole language would facilitate the linguistic and 
racial assimilation of the Afrikaners themselves. English, too, is 
changing quickly, and is no longer subject to what used to be the 
British norms; in many parts of the country it is also being Creolized, 
mixed with African words, the grammar and pronunciation losing their 
rigor. </p>
        <p> At first, the official push toward Creolization met with 
little resistance, and was even welcomed in liberal or left-wing 
circles. Recently, however, there has been a backlash against 
non-standard forms of Afrikaans, as well as mixing the language with 
English. A broad front of Afrikaner authors and intellectuals, including
 homosexual and left-wing writers, now vehemently opposes any form of 
mixing or denaturing. This has drawn a new racial line in the sand, 
because Afrikaans-speaking Colored journalists and intellectuals 
instinctively lean toward a Creolized language, and eschew any form of 
purity, whether linguistic or racial. </p>
        <p> Currently, Afrikanerdom is being scandalized by a novel that
 captures the ambiguities of even those Afrikaners who appear to have 
thrown over everything their ancestors stood for. The novel is <i>Kontrei,</i>
 published in 2003 by a 47-year old Bohemian living in one of the 
Johannesburg areas called Yeoville that has been taken over by blacks in
 the last five years. Once a Jewish quarter with synagogues and 
beautiful apartment buildings designed by famous South African 
architects, Yeoville is now a crime- and drug-ridden slum, lorded over 
by Nigerian and Congolese gangsters. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> Writing under the pseudonym of Kleinboer (Little Boer), the 
author describes his life as probably the last white person left in 
Yeoville. He lives with an HIV-positive Zulu woman and her mixed-race 
child by a Portuguese man; he also regularly visits black prostitutes 
from all over Africa in the many brothels in adjacent Hillbrow, an area 
known as the Manhattan of Africa when whites still lived there, as 
recently as 15 years ago. </p>
        <p> Academic studies show that it takes a prostitute in 
Johannesburg an average of six weeks to become infected with HIV. 
Although Kleinboer has, by his own admission, slept with over 400 black 
prostitutes, and though he lives with someone who is HIV-positive, he is
 a healthy man. He has a science degree, and is fanatical about wearing 
condoms. Despite free condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for 
advertising campaigns by government, few blacks manage to practice 
so-called &#8220;safe sex.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Kleinboer enjoys the rush of black life: sex at ten dollars a
 throw, the adrenaline of watching gang members kill each other, the 
free availability of drugs, in which he occasionally indulges. But he 
also answers the door with a machete, and sleeps with a loaded revolver 
under his pillow. During one of his forays into white society, Kleinboer
 tells his suburban host, &#8220;It is so nice to visit white people for a 
change that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind paying you for the privilege. I could never 
leave my cellphone or car keys lying about in Yeoville as I do here, not
 even in my own home.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Despite his almost incalculable distance from the Afrikaner 
society of Easter Friday services and school awards ceremonies, 
Kleinboer practises condom apartheid, and would probably never father a 
child with a black woman. Thus he hardly represents the model for the <i>métissage</i>
 or generalized race-mixing so often preached by visiting Westerners to 
South Africa, and who want to see whites cease to exist as a distinct 
racial and cultural group. </p>
        <p> Even a racial Bohemian like Kleinboer writes in the white 
form of Afrikaans, his book is read by whites, and he knows how to 
participate in a Caucasian high culture that utterly excludes those 
around him. His live-in Zulu lover will never read what he has written, 
because she does not understand Afrikaans, and is unaware that she has 
become a household name among white Afrikaners who find their own dark 
suspicions about black life confirmed by Kleinboer&rsquo;s humorous, decadent 
tale. Perhaps even for Kleinboer, the struggle for Afrikaans is 
emblematic of that wider resistance to being racially assimilated by the
 African masses. </p>
        <p> This resistance becomes increasingly necessary and 
difficult. The radical Indian minister of education, Kader Asmal, stated
 last year that there were no longer any Afrikaans universities   &mdash;   even 
though great institutions like Stellenbosch, Bloemfontein, Potchefstoom,
 Pretoria and the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) were built up by 
Afrikaners over more than a century. From now on they belong to the 
black state, which will turn them into English-language, multicultural 
institutions. </p>
        <p> <b>Intellectual Slaves</b> </p>
        <p> The demographic weight of the black majority, the reality of
 black power, and the persistant racial gap in skills and ability have 
put the Afrikaner in a strange position of servitude. White South 
Africans, particularly Afrikaners with their idealistic disposition and 
lingering patriotic feelings over a South Africa that no longer belongs 
to them, are in danger of becoming the intellectual slaves of blacks, 
much like the Greeks of Rome who educated Roman children and managed 
their masters&rsquo; households, estates, and businesses. </p>

        <p> South Africa is creating a new kind of cognitive and racial 
hierarchy never seen in the world before. Since 1994, at least in 
government service, there exists a kind of caste system in which the top
 echelons are filled by blacks who occupy all the prestigious jobs with 
high salaries and perks. Just below are Indians or left-wing 
English-speaking whites being rewarded for loyalty to the black cause. 
Middle and lower management, as well as technical jobs such as 
accountant or computer expert, are filled by Afrikaners who will never 
be promoted beyond a certain level because of their ethnic origin. At 
the most basic clerical level again, huge numbers of blacks are employed
 for the simple tasks of filing, answering the phone, or handing things 
over a counter. </p>
        <p> This same pattern is being repeated in the private sector, 
where hard-core intellectual and technical skills are provided by whites
 paid low wages. In private business, black managers who are appointed 
to fill race quotas are typically paid 50 percent more than their white 
counterparts, as the number who can hold down a job semi-functionally is
 so small that companies constantly bid up their services, using 
head-hunters and search agencies. These pampered black &#8220;executives&#8221; hop 
from job to job at ever-higher salaries, while whitey makes sure the 
work gets done. </p>
        <p> Many South African blacks have intuitively understood that 
whites have handy skills and abilities. A white brain stuffed with 
mathematics, accounting, and organizational skills, as well as a 
Teutonic work ethic, can be very useful. Not so long ago, Mathata Tsedu,
 the black editor of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> South Africa&rsquo;s 
largest-circulation weekly, wrote: &#8220;It pains me to say this, but my 
African colleagues who manage large companies or government departments 
tell me that to get a job done, you usually have to employ a white.&#8221; </p>

        <p> Few blacks ever pass science and mathematics at school; 
according to official statistics, a white high-school student is 100 
times more likely to pass mathematics at the higher grade required for 
university study than his black counterpart. This is despite the extra 
five percent &#8220;adjustment&#8221; in grades all blacks receive for studying in a
 supposedly second language, English. Although they are showered with 
corporate scholarships and money from foreign agencies and governments, 
almost no blacks get qualifications in rigorous intellectual fields like
 engineering, science, accounting and, until recently, medicine. </p>
        <p> When bonds were still traded on a floor in Johannesburg, 80 
percent of the traders taking risks on their own account were Afrikaner 
men. Probably more than half of stockbrokers are still Afrikaners. 
According to one expert on the South African software industry, as many 
as 80 percent of the computer programmers are young Afrikaner men. No 
one else can match them in sticking to tight deadlines, working through 
nights and weekends if necessary, and finding the most creative 
solutions to programming problems. Despite affirmative action, high-tech
 companies still employ them. In these companies, even among military 
suppliers, Afrikaans is usually the language most likely to be spoken 
around the water cooler. </p>
        <p> In at least one government department it was found that none
 of the top black managers was fit for the job. In a race-neutral 
environment they would be fired. However, in South Africa blacks are 
never fired, even for gross incompetence, especially in a bureaucracy. 
The solution was to a create a series of new posts reserved for whites, 
who would report to their black heads. The whites would essentially do 
the jobs of their black bosses, except they would be at a subordinate 
level, a kind of intellectual slave. They would stay in the background 
and not detract from the prestige of their black masters. In the same 
department, the average black academic qualification is a grade ten, two
 years short of a high school diploma, while the average white has a 
post-graduate degree. Management tells whites they must get a master&rsquo;s 
or doctoral degree if they want to keep their jobs, while they promise 
blacks a promotion if they manage to get a high school equivalency 
diploma. </p>
        <p> Throughout the country, highly qualified whites often work 
for blacks with low qualifications and skills. They have to correct 
their grammar and spelling, and do simple calculations for them, while 
paying them obeisance and responding to their every whim. Blacks have 
conquered, not by the sword nor by the intellect, but by the womb, and 
constantly refer to themselves as &#8220;the majority.&#8221; </p>
        <p> In South Africa, property is more and more defined as 
something a black person owns. A black may own a piece of land or a 
business outright, whereas a white may own it only in partnership with a
 black, or subject to conditions such as black empowerment or training 
for blacks so they can eventually take it over. There are many cases in 
which white intellectual slaves working for the government or major 
corporations must train up black replacements, after which they are 
fired because of their race. </p>
        <p> Increasingly, whites are economic slaves as well. They pay 
80 percent of personal taxes, despite earning only 50 percent of total 
salaries. Afrikaners as a group pay the highest portion of overall tax 
in South Africa   &mdash;   36 percent   &mdash;   while white English-speakers pay 32 
percent. When he was in exile in Britain, Mr. Mbeki is reputed to have 
said, &#8220;We will suck the whites dry,&#8221; and that is essentially what is 
happening. South Africa is like a small, first-world economy similar to 
that of Denmark or Norway, still run by whites, but which must support a
 welfare state for 40 million blacks and Coloreds. </p>
        <p> In their treatment of whites, however, blacks suffer from an
 internal conflict that often produces contradictory behavior. 
Rationally, they should continue their domination, keeping white 
taxpayers and intellectual slaves within the system. In practice, blacks
 often veer toward irrationality by excluding whites purely on racial 
grounds, just as Robert Mugabe has done in Zimbabwe by driving white 
farmers off the land, only to trigger an economic and food crisis to be 
cleaned up by other white people working for the UN and international 
aid agencies. </p>

        <p> When the remaining white officers in the South African army 
arrived back from their summer vacation in December last year, they 
found themselves fired for the following official reason: &#8220;whites lack 
credibility in Africa, and we sometimes have to engage in peace-keeping 
operations elsewhere on the continent.&#8221; Rumor has it that the South 
African army is already in dire straits, with 60 percent of its black 
troops suffering from AIDS. Alcoholism and indiscipline are rife. Firing
 the last remaining white officers will probably lead to the complete 
collapse of South Africa&rsquo;s armed forces. </p>
        <p> Exclusion on racial grounds is often absolute. Liberal and 
left-wing whites, especially communists, have been the staunchest allies
 of South African blacks. Yet after 1994, even Helena Dolny, the widow 
of Communist Party leader Joe Slovo, who had dedicated her life to the 
black cause, was fired and humiliated on racial grounds. </p>
        <p> Many former liberals have simply run away since the advent 
of black rule, no longer able to stand the crime and the collapse of 
public institutions. One is the widow of liberal author Alan Paton, who 
stated upon her departure, &#8220;Our president has called those who leave the
 country cowards. I have to confess that I am now about to join the 
number of those cowards who are streaming out of the country.&#8221; Nadine 
Gordimer&rsquo;s daughter finds it safer to live in the south of France than 
in South Africa. </p>
        <p> Liberal and especially foreign whites, such as tourists, are
 usually the first victims of crime, as they lack vigilance, and trust 
black strangers more than they should. Anti-white racism and crime 
alienate even those whites who would otherwise serve blacks. Of course, 
when commentators do refer to the vicious outbreak of violence that has 
characterised the so-called new South Africa under black rule, it has 
mostly been to blame apartheid for the violence, forgetting that most of
 the young black perpetrators grew up under black rule. </p>
        <p> So what are the prospects for an Afrikaner nation? A less 
peace-loving, pragmatic people would by this time surely have come out 
in violent revolt, if its children were virtually banned from the most 
sought-after medical and law schools, and excluded from jobs in 
government or major corporations on the grounds of race and language. </p>
        <p> I suppose the real test of a nation is whether it can 
survive bad leadership and defeat. Afrikaners today suffer a domination 
almost as intense as that of the Greeks under 400 years of Turkish rule,
 during which Christianity and the Greek language were banned, and 
people had to keep the Bible and Greek books in secret recesses in their
 houses. Many people in South Africa, notably the anglophone 
intellectuals with their radical chic and admiration for everything 
African, have already pronounced the Afrikaner nation dead. </p>
        <p> Yet a people who fought wars for two centuries, both against
 black tribes and the greatest empire of the time, who produced the 
finest body of literature on the African continent, a philosophy, and a 
highly intellectualized Calvinist theology, and that enjoys its own 
cuisine, customs and folk culture, does not one day cease to exist just 
because Nelson Mandela smiles into the cameras and declares the birth of
 a new nation on these shores. </p>

        <p> It is somehow hard to believe that Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s African 
Empire will succeed where the British Empire failed, by eradicating, as 
Lord Alfred Milner put it around 1900, &#8220;the last vestiges of 
Afrikanerism from South Africa.&#8221; The ham-fisted way the South African 
government is trying to suppress the Afrikaner identity in favor of an 
imported quasi-American multiculturalism mixed with warmed-over 
pan-Africanism, is bound to provoke the slumbering Afrikaner spirit of 
resistance. The dogged Afrikaner nationalism of the 20th century that 
transformed the entire country must count as one of the most powerful 
movements ever to arise in Africa. To this day, South Africa is littered
 with the monuments and buildings erected during that flowering of 
nationalism, of which the majestic art déco of the Voortrekker Monument 
on a hill overlooking Pretoria is the most visible. </p>
        <p> On 16 December last, the Afrikaners commemorated their 
victory over the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River in 1838   &mdash;   known as 
the Day of the Covenant, but ridiculously rechristened &#8220;Reconciliation 
Day&#8221; by the new government. While tens of thousands of Afrikaners 
gathered in typical fashion all over the country at their own expense to
 affirm their traditional vow to be true to their God and their people, 
Mr. Mbeki and his cohorts organized a grand gathering on the lawns of 
the Union Buildings in Pretoria, spending two million dollars of 
taxpayer money on free food in the hope of attracting 20,000 people. 
However, only 2,000 of Mr. Mbeki&rsquo;s followers showed up, and truck-loads 
of food went to waste, while at least 5,000 Afrikaners attended a 
ceremony a few kilometers away at the Voortrekker Monument. </p>
        <p> Reflect upon it: Afrikaner patriotism and national sentiment
 are derided by the media, both locally and internationally, as 
right-wing racism, and their language and identity are officially 
suppressed. At the same time, Mr. Mbeki&rsquo;s brand of multicultural, 
Afro-nationalism and black pride is propagated by the state and 
embellished by the media and dozens of conformist commentators. One then
 realises that perhaps the weakness lies not so much with the 
downtrodden &#8220;white tribe of Africa&#8221; whom the world sees as backward 
hillbillies, but possibly with South Africa&rsquo;s radiantly confident rulers
 whose power is literally skin-deep, founded as it is on a late 20th 
century fashion for the color black. </p>
        <p> <b>Afrikaner Weaknesses</b> </p>
        <p> And yet, despite their obvious strengths and courage, 
Afrikaners suffer from several weaknesses characteristic of Western man.
 Most are practising Christians, endowed with a sense of altruism that 
may yet prove fatal. The three mainstream Afrikaans churches already 
encourage their members to look after AIDS babies abandoned by black 
mothers. Afrikaans newspapers carry stories about the selfless devotion 
of adoptive parents who are raising children of the race that is 
oppressing and killing them. </p>
        <p> As for the non-Afrikaner churches, both the Church of 
England and the Catholic Church have been thoroughly infiltrated by 
Africans. The Anglican Church in South Africa is now a black church with
 a black archbishop who preaches white surrender and black entitlement. 
Protestant churches everywhere in the West have become hotbeds of 
capitulationist thinking, and welcome Third-World immigration into even 
the most ancient white homelands. </p>
        <p> In <i>The World and the West,</i> Arnold Toynbee wrote that &#8220;technology is, of course, only a long Greek name for a bag of tools  &hellip;
 But all tools are not of the material kind; there are spiritual tools 
as well, and these are the most potent that Man has made.&#8221; Just as 
communism used to be a Western weapon in the hands of Russia, as Toynbee
 remarked in the 1950s, so Christianity has become a piece of occidental
 technology in the hands of today&rsquo;s Africans. </p>
        <p> Another major Afrikaner weakness is dependence on cheap 
labor. There have long been warnings about this, but to no avail. At a 
time when race relations were more natural, black labor was satisfactory
 to black and white alike. Even today, apart from the super-rich 
nomenklatura connected to the state and big business, black South Africa
 consists of a slave class that would not survive without white masters.
 </p>
        <p> One could do a whole linguistic analysis of all the words in Afrikaans that have to do with &#8220;master&#8221; or <i>baas,</i> which literally means &#8220;boss.&#8221; There is <i>oubaas,</i>
 old master, an endearing term for an elderly white person, the white 
patriarch who provides jobs. When a friend visits her land holdings, the
 remaining blacks in the area lament the death of the <i>oubaas,</i> and the good times when there was a white provider who could train them, employ them and look after them. Then there is <i>kleinbaas</i> or young master, the son in the household, who would eventually fulfill that role and is therefore already worthy of respect. </p>

        <p> Not long ago, as part of the government&rsquo;s meddling in land 
ownership, a large white farm was bought out and turned over to more 
than 1,000 blacks as part of their &#8220;liberation.&#8221; Soon a deputation 
visited one of the white agricultural unions that usually spends its 
time defending its members&rsquo; remaining property against spurious black 
land claims. The new black farmers asked for a <i>baas</i> to come and tell them what to do and to stop the infighting. I do not know if they got their <i>baas,</i> but when the famous citrus farm, Zebedelia, was facing bankruptcy after being handed over to blacks, it got a white <i>baas.</i> Within a year or two, Zebedelia was again exporting oranges to the rest of the world. </p>
        <p> However, in most cases such racial patronage is no longer 
possible, and whites cannot freely harness the labor of blacks the way 
blacks harness the brains of whites. The Orania experiment next to the 
Orange River in the remote Northern Cape shows that Afrikaners do not 
need black labor. Foreign journalists flock to Orania as if to some 
exotic zoo to see 800 white Afrikaners living self-sufficiently and in 
peace, without crime and drugs, digging their own ditches, laying their 
own bricks. If the Oranians can do without servants, gardeners and the 
plethora of glorified beggars who clutter our lives for a few rand a 
day, so can the rest of us. Ever since the founding of Cape Town by Jan 
van Riebeeck in 1652, white reluctance to do manual labour when 
thousands of natives were prepared to work for a pittance has been the 
downfall of any attempt to set up an autonomous and self-sufficient 
white society. </p>
        <p> In the 1880s, President Paul Kruger ordered that white 
farmers were to have no more than five black families on their land; the
 law was widely ignored. By some estimates, at that time the Boers 
formed an absolute majority in the two northern republics [the Orange 
Free State, now Free State province, and the Transvaal, now broken up 
into Gauteng, North West, and Northern provinces], but a century of 
black population growth aided by Western medicine and nutrition has 
reduced Afrikaners to a tiny and oppressed minority in their own 
country. </p>
        <p> And yet, even in dispossession, the Afrikaner retains much 
of his traditional nature. Blacks, as recipients of affirmative action 
largesse and handouts from government and the private sector, have 
experienced breathtaking social mobility never before seen in the 
history of black people anywhere. The typical image of the South African
 black today is sitting behind the steering wheel of a Mercedes 
convertible or a BMW SUV. That is, apart from the millions who subsist 
in shanty towns that the vast government housing projects never seem to 
clear away. </p>
        <p> By contrast, the typical Afrikaner probably still drives a 
pick-up truck. In fact, the market for these utilitarian vehicles, 
called <i>bakkies</i> in South Africa, is still 60 percent Afrikaans, 
even though Afrikaners represent only five percent of the population. 
Makers of German luxury vehicles have long forsaken Afrikaners for the 
new breed of well-heeled government official or corporate mogul produced
 by the system of so-called black economic empowerment.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" width="11" height="11" /> </p>

		<p>It may be a challenge to allowing White South Africans immigrate to the USA due to evil people like Senator Brownback:</p>
<p>&#8220;Left-wing Republican and illegal alien amnesty advocate Sen. Sam Brownback was asked by a CofCC member if he would support granting political asylum to white South Africans, since he is such a fan of immigration. Brownback replied that granting whites asylum would be a bad idea, because they &ldquo;might bring racist attitudes to the United States.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>A good, descriptive article about the state of the nation in 2004. But time has not stood still and the decay is advancing at a pace you would not believe.</p>
<p>For software programmers - if you look at the banks and insurers and civil service, it is getting less and less white. Just as in the USA, they are making use of Indians and at the same time there is an increased use of software packages that replace human labor. I know of a company that is switching to an Boston software package with the idea of outsourcing the maintenance to India and development to the USA. If done to its fullest consequence, work for white South Africans has disappeared and mission critical software has been put into a safer environment, away from perceived incompetent fingers.  </p>

<p>In a prison, which the U.S. will increasingly resemble as it darkens, Hispanics will sometimes team up with whites against blacks.</p>
<p>This is a good thing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanics will sometimes team up with whites against blacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is good that there is a qualification of &#8216;sometimes&rsquo; and not &#8216;definite&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If by &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; one means a &#8216;mullato&rsquo; type of person, and comparable to the South African experience of the 4,4 million Cape coloreds, which are also mullato&rsquo;s but of a different breed, then this:</p>
<p>They do team up with us whites but not for the sake of the whites but for their own survival.</p>
<p>During the People&rsquo;s War (google the book with the same name, written by Anthea Jeffery) leaders in the colored community formed some of the most verocious anti-white activists against us.</p>
<p>Names like the reverend Allan Hendrickse and Allan Boesak (Maggoo bar bomber) immediately spring to my mind, and these are not the only ones.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Readers should be especially careful about criticizing the traditional religions of the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since American Renaissance has posted this sentence in their guidelines.  I don&rsquo;t know exactly when it was added, but I suspect that I am one of the reasons for it.</p>
<p>Silencing debate about whether one &#8220;traditionally Western religion&#8221; or another serves whites best is a valid set of issues for discussion.</p>
<p>I wrote a comment for submission here pointing out what the article&rsquo;s writer has said about the ill affects of Christianity on Boer and larger Western white survival.  If this is a banned discussion, then Amren has taken a choice that is unwaveringly in favor of counter intellectual discussion on what is in this writer&rsquo;s view, probably the largest problem facing white survival at its core.  This restriction on discussion will result in the failure of the White Realist Movement to recruit from the larger and likely more educated (higher IQ) white pool.<br>
On the other hand, if this site represents a hang out for true believers, then there never was any hope.</p>
<p>If the arguments  and comments I have submitted to Amren for the past five years are faulty, then debate on posts ought to be allowed to reveal it.  A blackout on a subject like this tends to reveal a fear of intellectual confrontation, and the inability to admit error or to possess the ability to change, to evolve into a philosophy that might better enhance survival.  Intellectual Darwinism is at work here.</p>

<p>Okay Amren, why don&rsquo;t you list what American Renaissance considers the &#8220;traditional religions of the West,&#8221; and why do you consider critical discussion a threat?</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not a  truth existing which I fear or would wish unknown to the whole world.&#8221; - Thomas Jefferson</p>
