<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Freedom Party (FPÖ) leader Heinz  &mdash;  Christian Strache said today (Weds) at his party&rsquo;s  conclave in Saalbach-Hinterglemm in Salzburg&rsquo;s Pinzgau region that he feared a renewal of &#8220;massive immigration&#8221; into Austria.</p>
<p>Strache explained that new People&rsquo;s Party (ÖVP) leader Michael Spindelegger&rsquo;s choice of 24-year-old Sebastian Kurz as new state secretary for integration in the interior ministry and of Lower Austrian Councillor Johanna Mikl-Leitner as new interior minister would make Austrian integration policy &#8220;drastically worse&#8221; although it had already been bad enough under outgoing Interior Minister Maria Fekter, who will become new finance minister.</p>
<p>As for Kurz, Strache continued, it was not a question of his age but of his personality and qualifications. Kurz, whom Strache called &#8220;a copy of (former Finance Minister Karl-Heinz) Grasser,&#8221; had demonstrated his lack of qualification during the 2010 Vienna city government election, Strache claimed.</p>
<p>The success of young people, he added, depended on their ability to address the problems of the young and to solve them. &#8220;We are successful because we respond to the concerns of the young. We will see whether Kurz is ready to implement FPÖ policy in that regard,&#8221; Strache said.</p>
<p>As for Mikl-Leitner, Strache charged that Lower Austrian ÖVP Governor Erwin Pröll, whom some political observers consider to be the strongest person in his party, had sent her as his &#8220;pro-consul&#8221; to Vienna to push for continued implementation of past party policies.</p>
<p>Strache called ÖVP efforts to solve its problems by engaging in personnel changes &#8220;the false path.&#8221; The FPÖ, on the other hand, had a first-class leadership team and did not need to engage in any personnel changes, he claimed.</p>
<p>Strache said the FPÖ would position itself as &#8220;a family, environment and anti-atom party.&#8221; He called for Austrian withdrawal from the Euratom Treaty and for tax relief for families. No family with four or more children should have to pay any taxes, he said.</p>

		<p> It would be terrible if Austria were to be flooded with colored immigrants. It is a delightful country that shows how pleasant a nation can be when occupied primarily by whites. Returning to the U.S. can be slightly depressing as you become re-accustomed to the pants-around-the-knees culture. I wish the Austrians luck in blocking a tsunami worse than what has hit Japan.</p>

		<p>I applaud the idea of tax relief for larger families.  If Europe is to have a future, she must procreate.</p>

<p>Strache had better explicitly state that this &#8220;tax relief&#8221; is for White families only.  Otherwise, every breeding-age Moslem, Ethiopian and Pakistani is going to be packing up and heading for Austria at any minute.<br>

		<p>Sounds like typical political sniping as a (in) &#8216;game of it&rsquo;s own&rsquo;.  Only the players know what the heck is being talked about and only the players get a reasonable insight to how it could be better &#8216;if only&rsquo; X personality wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Rather than if Y policy was ennunciated.</p>
<p>All well and good if you want to play the snob&rsquo;s-snub-each-other game but if Austria doesn&rsquo;t secede from the EU and remove it&rsquo;s crazed open borders policy, it&rsquo;s not a matter of if but only when they lose all &#8216;Austrianness&rsquo; to a flood of immigrant hordes.</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s not likely that Austrian women will conform to a positive eugenics enticement like Germany&rsquo;s did, the question becomes: how do you -replace the failed half- of the reproductive solution?</p>
<p>And the answer is not tax credits which must be applied &#8216;uniformly without racial disparity&rsquo; but _exogenics_ which only the rich can afford and which therefore allow whites to make babies without the woman losing 9 months from her life and all her looks in a professional environment.</p>
<p>You have to look at this problem the same way we once successfully resolved racial demographics in real estate: exclusion by affordability and tax bracket.</p>
