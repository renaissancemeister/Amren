<h1>Where Are They Now?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William L. Houston, Youth for Western Civilization, April 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of my favorite hobbies for several years now has been keeping track of former &#8220;civil rights&#8221; celebrities after their fifteen minutes of undeserved media fame are over. It is an excellent way to demonstrate how political correctness has corrupted American journalism.</p>
<p>Everyone in America has at least a passing familiarity with these victims of White &#8220;racism,&#8221; but few are familiar with their trials since then, which the mainstream media has refused to give the same amount of inordinate attention.</p>
<p>Where are these martyrs for &#8220;social justice&#8221; now?</p>
<p><strong>Rodney King</strong></p>
<p>Rodney King is my personal favorite: in the years since the Los Angeles riots, which led to the death of 55 people, King has been arrested for soliciting and having sex with a transvestite prostitute in Hollywood, beating his wife, multiple DUIs, vandalism, beating his own child, and indecent exposure in a public park while being high on PCP.</p>
<p>In 2003, King drove his car into a house after weaving through traffic and traveling at a speed over 100 mph. Two years later, he was arrested after threatening to kill his daughter and former girlfriend.</p>
<p>Don Lemon recently glamorized Rodney King in a CNN Presents special report called &#8220;Race and Rage: The Beating of Rodney King&#8221; to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the alleged &#8220;racist beating&#8221; of this scumbag.</p>
<p>King won a cool $3.8 million dollar settlement in his civil suit. He used the money to start a hip hop record label.</p>
<p>A month ago, Rodney King was stopped by the LAPD for erratic driving and was issued a citation for driving with an expired license. Twenty years later, Rodney King is still a threat to public safety.</p>
<p><strong>Jena 6</strong></p>
<p>The Jena 6 were six black students in Jena, Louisiana who in an unprovoked assault beat a White student named Justin Barker nearly to death in 2006. Al Sharpton marched on Jena with 15,000 to 20,000 supporters to protest the clear injustice that was done to Barker&rsquo;s black attackers.</p>
<p>The Jena 6 movement was hailed in the mainstream media at the time as &#8220;the first struggle of the 21st century Civil Rights Movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2007, Jesse Ray Beard was accused, convicted and sentenced for simple battery, simple criminal damage to property less than $500 and simple assault.</p>
<p>In 2008, Bryant Purvis was arrested for assaulting a fellow high school student in Texas. </p>
<p>Corwin Jones was arrested for trespassing and simple battery following an incident in which he struck a man from behind.</p>
<p>Also in 2008, Mychal Bell spat in the face of his female attorney and pushed her to the ground. He was arrested later that year for shoplifting, resisting arrest, and simple assault after trying to steal $700 worth of clothes from a Dillard&rsquo;s department store.</p>
<p>In 2010, Bell was arrested and charged with battery after punching someone who was &#8220;running his mouth&#8221; at a Jena barber shop.</p>
<p>Catrina Wallace, the sister of Robert Bailey, founder of &#8220;Organizing in the Trenches,&#8221; and central organizer of the Jena 6 protests, was arrested in &#8220;Operation Third Option&#8221; in 2009 and was recently convicted on three counts of distribution of a controlled substance. She faces decades in prison.</p>
<p>Marcus Jones, father of Mychal Bell, is calling for a Justice Department investigation into the arrest and conviction of Ms. Wallace.</p>
<p><strong>Duke Lacrosse Stripper</strong></p>
<p>In 2006, a black stripper named Crystal Magnum falsely accused three Duke lacrosse players, all of whom were White, of raping her at a party. Like the Jena 6, the Duke lacrosse scandal ignited a media firestorm about White racism and brought out all the usual suspects.</p>
<p>Hysteria swept Duke University.</p>
<p>The accused players were suspended, the team&rsquo;s coach was fired, and the entire lacrosse season was cancelled. The case later fell apart after it became obvious that Magnum had fabricated her story.</p>
<p>This morning Crystal Magnum was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after attempting to kill her boyfriend with a kitchen knife. The officers who arrived on the scene found that Magnum had succeeded in stabbing him in the torso.</p>
<p>In December, jurors found Magnum guilty of three counts of contributing to the abuse and neglect of minors (her own children who were taken away by social services), resisting arrest, and $500 worth of property damage. She had set fire to the clothes of her then boyfriend in a bathtub.</p>

		<p>FoxNews isn&rsquo;t our friend, although they wink at us on occasion, because they don&rsquo;t interview Sharpie and Jesse and ask them why these thugs can&rsquo;t eradicate the effects of shameful and lingering White racism by refusing to commit crimes.</p>
<p>Dang, maybe I&rsquo;m starting to sound like Jared Taylor, which means I&rsquo;ve evolved in my race realism to the critical phase that can make a real difference for White Humanity.</p>

		<p> Hope several of you AmReners who are younger and more Internet-savvy than me will post this article to any website that strikes your fancy. It will be interesting to see what happens.</p>
<p> Also, as a retired newspaper reporter, I always wished that, after the Rodney King riots and controversy had finally run their course, some enterprising reporter with an independent bent had looked up that bleeding-heart White guy who video-taped the &#8220;beating&#8221; of King and took it to a local TV station. Had I been the reporter, I would have asked the guy, &#8220;If you had known in advance that taping that incident and making the tape public would have resulted in city-wide riots, 55 deaths, millions of dollars in damage, would you have still done it?&#8221;</p>
<p> But of course mighty few reporters would have asked a &#8220;game-changing&#8221; question like that. Why spoil a good &#8220;Racist White cops beat innocent African American&#8221; story?</p>

		<p>MSNBC has an upcoming program called &#8220;The Black Agenda&#8221; hosted by liberal kneejerker Ed Schultz.  It&rsquo;s been slotted, however, in the Sunday noon graveyard, a time  &mdash;  my husband tells me  &mdash;   when the station normally begins its afternoon-through-evening dumping ground fare of prison reality shows.  Ironic, huh?  The lefties at MSNBC apparently don&rsquo;t even realize that such a title has a sinister ring and that almost all whites would be alarmed at any kind of black agenda!  <br>
Judging by the wannabe martyrs mentioned in the above article, the agenda of such blacks is to simply fleece the system.  Rodney King got all that money, and yet he&rsquo;s driving with an expired license!  Many low-class blacks simply refuse to follow any rules.  They don&rsquo;t keep their driver&rsquo;s license or registration up to date, they don&rsquo;t have car insurance, and their vehicles have safety violations.  Then, when they receive citations or are allowed bail, they don&rsquo;t pay fines or show up for court.  <br>
In the old days, uncivilized criminals like this bunch would go to prison to serve long sentences.  Now, they&rsquo;re turned loose to run wild like zoo animals on the city streets.</p>

		<p>I am surprised that Rodney Glenn is doing as well as he is. I had told a number of persons you will read about Rodney Glenn say, ten, fifteen, twenty years from now. &#8220;Remember him Madge&#8221;, that is Rodney.&#8221; &#8220;He was the man who &hellip;!&#8221; At some point I had expected for Rodney to be involved in an altercation over money, a dime or so, a cigarette, a parking space, get into big trouble in an instant, and meet a bad demise. Would have been so typical. And investing his ill-gotten in a record producing company making hip-hop music &#8220;records&#8221;. Well - - a fool and his money!</p>

		<p>Paybacks are hell-aren&rsquo;t they?  These media darlings have proved by their subsequent actions that they are nothing but thugs and sociopaths.  As someone who became a race-realist years ago, the sad reality is that many blacks lie, cheat, steal, disregard the law, and resort to violence as a &#8220;solution&#8221; to their problems.</p>

		<p>#17 said: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t forget to add the four cretins shot by Bernhard Goetz.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:<br>
In March 1985, soon after being released from the hospital for the treatment of his gunshot wound, James Ramseur falsely reported to police that two men hired by Goetz had kidnapped and attempted to kill him, but was not charged in this hoax. In May 1985, Ramseur held the gun while an associate raped, sodomized and robbed a pregnant eighteen-year-old woman on the rooftop of the Bronx building where he lived, and in 1986 was sentenced to 8⅓ to 25 years in prison. </p>
<p>Barry Allen committed two robberies after the shooting, one of them a chain snatching in the elevator of the building where he lived. The second arrest brought him a sentence of up to four years for probation violation. </p>
<p>Canty was ordered to undergo treatment at a rehabilitation center.</p>

<p>Repeat every day.</p>
<p>NEVER FORGET.</p>
<p>Our race&rsquo;s collective memory was co-opted after 1917, by the same interests that killed the Czar and all the White Nobility in Russia. The White Man is awakening from their &#8216;Babylonian Captivity&rsquo; and we must look to our roots, to remember who we are as a people, and as a Race, and never forget.</p>

		<p>When it comes to stuff like this, I would have to say that Rodney King is the pure poster boy for racial uprisings! I would say also that who really cares about these individuals, but it&rsquo;s laughable after all the trouble that got their 15 minutes of fame, they still get into more trouble the media just can&rsquo;t get the guts to introduce to us in a wide audience format. </p>
<p>And we all know the reasons why o.j. won that trial and why it dragged along for so long. <br>
1. Ratings!<br>
2. Gasp! What if there&rsquo;s another L.A. riots pt.2!?<br>
3. If we let oj win, there may not be any riots.</p>
