<h1>Couple Arraigned on Charges They Stomped an Elderly Man to Death amid Domestic Dispute</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Preston and Bill Hutchinson, NY Daily News, April 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pair of lovebirds facing life as jailbirds were arraigned Sunday on charges they capped a boozy date by stomping a would-be good Samaritan to death in the street.</p>
<p>Quintin Guerrero, 61, was killed when he rushed to aid one of his accused attackers, Tosheba Alford, 20, after she jumped out of a moving cab in front of his Bronx house to escape a beating from her boyfriend, Alford&rsquo;s mother, Queen Smith, said.</p>
<p>Alford told cops she never raised a hand to man who tried to help her, insisting she attempted to stop her boyfriend, Kendall Major, 35, from killing Guerrero.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Major and Alford were arraigned Sunday in Bronx Supreme Court on second-degree murder charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The couple, who had spent the evening drinking heavily, were headed to Major&rsquo;s house in the Bronx when they started fighting in the back of Ruiz&rsquo;s livery cab, Smith said.</p>
<p>She told reporters her daughter called her from the cab when Major started hitting her, accusing her of having an incestuous relationship with her brother.</p>
<p>Smith said her daughter jumped out of the moving cab, hurting her leg. She limped over and sat down on Guerrero&rsquo;s front stoop, prompting the victim to come out of his house and check on her.</p>
<p>As Guerrero was asking Alford if she was hurt, Major jumped out of the cab, pummeled Guerrero to the ground and kicked him repeatedly, Alford told her mother.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors scoffed at Major&rsquo;s statement that Guerrero hit him first and told him to &#8220;mind your own business.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In San Francisco, a black was beating his girlfriend, or wife, I dont know what in a restaurant. An Idealist intervened. For that, he was shot in the chest by the male.In London not long ago, two blacks were fighting in a McDonalds restaurant. A male, black, broke them up. One of the fighters then had someone get him a gun, guns are illegal to have in England.The &#8220;good&#8221; samaratan was shot four times to death.I would NEVER risk my life for a couple of (well, I cant say it).</p>

		<p>Having been witness to numerous domestics over the years, as much as I hate to say it, I have a hard time concerning my personal safety to intervene in such things. </p>
<p>I have been burned in similar situations where once the male was pried off the female victim, both turned their anger at me and others trying to restore order. </p>
<p>Fighting and beating each other is part of how they relate to one another. This is how they define their relationship. She is not a victim, but a participant after their first fight, so I dont get too concerned anymore. </p>
<p>Now the only parties I will always intervene for are children and animals&hellip;. everyone else got themselves into this mess. </p>

		<p>I know you are not supposed to say it and I am really not quite sure why any verifiable truth should be suppressed, but that is just the way it is in America today.<br>
Anyone (not white) can say the most evil things and that is Their Right To Free Speech, on the other hand if a white person makes any comment that doesn&rsquo;t portray the non white as a sacred god he is called a HATER.<br>
When (if ever) will white people redevelop the backbone they once had?<br>
Now as far as these two BEASTS go, please allow me to give you a little advice.</p>
<p>1. blacks in particular love to abuse those that are weaker than they are.</p>
<p>2. Never and I mean Never get involved in any argument between two blacks or even a black with a white Unless You Are Prepared to put the beast down. Because if you are not they will put you into a world of hurt and don&rsquo;t forget the Little Extra they like to throw in - Even if you do not have vocal chords you always called them that infamous N word.<br>
3. Always take any interaction with these creatures Very Seriously, never assume they are just talking. They are feeling you out to see how weak you might be, so ALWAYS be prepared to defend yourself in the most violent physical way because that is what it might come to  &hellip;. Never argue with a black, Never, remain calm cool and always ready and on guard to protect yourself and your life, they are more out of control today than ever and they ALL feel the white person is Afraid of them. <br>
They appriciate nothing and always feel Mr Whitey owes them more.<br>
What about all the years of A.A. advancing them beyond their actual worth.<br>
What about the 600,000 whites who dies in the Civil War?<br>
With blacks you can Never Do Enough they always will demand even more Hep then you gave them.</p>

		<p>Any cop will tell you that DV is some of the most dangerous to intervene in.  You peel the husband off his wife and handcuff him, and she spins around and plants a knife in your back (the knife she was attempting to plunge into her husbands chest a second ago).</p>

		<p>No one should be surprised.  This is the status quo for domestic violence and one of the reasons cops -hate- to respond to them and always call for backup when available.</p>
<p>What is important to realize is that if these two fine citizens are in fact black it corresponds to the increased rate of black spousal abuse and homicide (yes, forcing someone to exit a moving taxi &#8216;for fear of greater life threatening harm&rsquo; is attempted murder) in interracial marriages.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Last week, in an entry about a white woman and Fortune 100 employee in Atlanta who married a black man and was shot to death by him two weeks later, I asked, &#8220;Has anyone ever done a study of the mortality rate of white women who become involved with / marry black men?&#8221;<br>
In response, a reader has sent a pdf of a paper, &#8220;Fatal Violence among Spouses in the United States, 1976-85,&#8221; by James A. Mercy and Linda E. Saltzman. </p>
<p>This is from the abstract: </p>
<p><br>
In this paper we examine patterns and trends in homicides between marriage partners in the United States for 1976 through 1985 using data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation&rsquo;s Supplemental Homicide Reports (FBI-SHR). We identified 16,595 spouse homicides accounting for 8.8 per cent of all homicides reported to the FBI-SHR during this 10-year period&hellip;. The risk of victimization was greater for spouses in interracial than in intraracial marriages &hellip; </p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the paper: </p>
<p>Of spouse homicides occurring from 1979 to 1981, 96.3 per cent occurred in intraracial marriages. Spouse homicides in marriages where the husband was Black and the wife was White constituted 1.4 per cent of the total &hellip; Spouse homicide incidence rates were 7.7 times higher in interracial marriages relative to intraracial marriages. [Italics added.] The patterns in this risk varied by race and sex. White husbands, White wives, and Black wives were at greater risk of being killed by a spouse in an interracial than an intraracial marriage, whereas Black husbands were at less risk (Table 3). </p>
<p>The above figures are from a three-year period 30 years ago. Are they generally representative? We need more data. <br>

<p>As I have often said: Not. Our. Problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad thing when whites must learn the crusaderism is NOT the &#8216;higher moral conscience&rsquo; thing to do.  But it is true.  If the poor guy was hispanic, all the more so.</p>

		<p>If they are both black and it&rsquo;s a domestic then ignore it as if it&rsquo;s not even there. Do not involve yourself apart from discreetly calling the police.<br>
It&rsquo;s a black thing, don&rsquo;t get into the picture, they don&rsquo;t like good samaritans.</p>

<p><br>
I have been told by police officers that the very worst situation that they dread the most is a violent domestic dispute. The combatants will suddenly make up and will both turn on YOU when you arrive to help them! You become the common enemy.</p>
<p>They are beyond helping. They have made their own messed up relationship, and this is what they want. They even enjoy it.  They will resent you as an intruder in what they consider  none of your damned business. It&rsquo;s a family affair! You keep out.</p>
<p>Many battered women, when asked if they want help, will say &#8220;no&#8221;. If asked if they want to press charges, they will say &#8220;no&#8221;. They will refuse all help. Among blacks this behavior is considered quite normal.</p>
<p>Just leave them alone and ignore them. They got themselves into this situation, let them get themselves out of it. It&rsquo;s not worth risking YOUR life to come to their aid and get killed.</p>
<p>BTW, I have seen black women abusing their men too.  Some of those West Indian women have a ferocious temper!</p>

		<p>I once saw a latino teenager slap his girlfriend right in the face real hard while they were arguing.  I felt immediately like I should get involved and protect the girl, but, and this is uncharacteristic of me, a little voice shouted in my head &#8220;No! Leave it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later the girl was snuggling up to the guy as if she was all at fault, - He was now the guy who had his cajones affirmed and his machismo fully aired.  If I would have gotten involved, like I would have if someone was hitting a white girl, then that gangbanger might have shot or hit ME and that would have caused escalation.  </p>
<p>After seeing, (and having it explained to me by several persons later on) how latino men routinely use physical force to keep their ladies in line, I resolved never to intervene in any violence done by a black or latino to his girl ever.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. Haven&rsquo;t these lovebirds heard of the great &#8220;rainbow coalition&#8221;? African- and Hispanic-Americans are supposed to work together to oppose evil racist white men, and build a just and equitious society.</p>

		<p>I remember a  woman  (black of course) who would come into the station house every  couple of weeks, filing a complaint that her &#8220;man&#8221; had beaten her up. It was a regular thing.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t want to press charges. She did&rsquo;t want to do anything. She didn&rsquo;t want him to get hurt. She just wanted to tell us about it.</p>
<p>I asked her, &#8220;Well, what do you want anyway? What do you want us to DO?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer was nothing.  And why not?  Because she said she &#8220;loved him&#8221;. </p>
<p>I told her,  &#8220;Lady, this is a police department. We make arrests here.  That&rsquo;s what we do. This is not an office to file papers.&#8221; </p>
<p>I guess she just thought it was her civic duty to report it every time  he beat her up. But she didn&rsquo;t want any help. </p>
<p>These people are hopeless!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, Ruiz was praised as a hero Sunday by his colleagues at the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, who awarded him with a $500 check and a bullet proof vest for helping cops nab the killers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hahahaha!</p>
<p>A bullet-proof vest for a cabbie.  Is this empire on a downward path or not when a cab driver needs a bullet-proof vest?</p>
