			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vince Cable today condemned David Cameron&rsquo;s speech on immigration as &#8216;very unwise&rsquo; and suggested it could &#8216;inflame extremism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Business Secretary hinted that the Prime Minister was electioneering by giving his first major speech on the controversial issue weeks before local elections.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron&rsquo;s speech this lunchtime is the strongest on immigration by a Prime Minister for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>He admitted Britain has been torn apart by the biggest influx of immigrants in history and spell out how the Government aims to bring levels back down.</p>
<p>The address pitched him straight into a row with Mr Cable, who has been outspoken about migrant levels ever since the coalition formed last year.</p>
<p>Today, the Business Secretary made clear the Lib Dems  &mdash;  who backed an immigration amnesty during the general election  &mdash;  were distancing themselves.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;The reference to the tens of thousands of immigrants rather than hundreds of thousands is not part of the coalition agreement, it is Tory party policy only.</p>
<p>&#8216;I do understand there is an election coming but talk of mass immigration risks inflaming the extremism to which he and I are both strongly opposed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lib Dem sources have tried to play down Mr Cable&rsquo;s comments, insisting that the coalition partners are agreed on immigration policy.</p>
<p>&#8216;This is a Conservative Prime Minister speaking to Conservative party activists using Conservative language,&rsquo; the source said. &#8216;Vince is saying that we are of a slightly different opinion on immigration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was shown a copy of the speech beforehand and is said to be &#8216;proud&rsquo; of the coalition&rsquo;s &#8216;sensible&rsquo; approach.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron later rejected the criticism, insisting he was dealing with the issue in a &#8216;sensible, measured, serious tone&rsquo; and that everything had been signed off by the coalition. </p>
<p>&#8216;The country elected a Government wanting us to roll up our sleeves and deal with some of these issues,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;This speech is, I think, a very good explanation if how we are dealing with them in an extremely fair and sensible way.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am very willing to be judged by the British people, not only on the content of the speech and the action we are taking, but also the very measured way in which it is being described and put forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He admitted there had been some &#8216;really serious arguments&rsquo; in the Government over the policy but insisted they had all been laid to rest.</p>
<p>&#8216;The policy has been agreed by the coalition. It is coalition and Government policy and it is being put in place right across the board,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Coalitions do mean you have discussions and argument within your Government. We have had those, we&rsquo;ve settled the policy, we&rsquo;ve agreed it. We have a very good, robust policy and that is the policy of the whole Government.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his address to party activists, Mr Cameron blamed a welfare system which has paid Britons to stay idle and foreign jobseekers &#8216;not really wanting or even willing to integrate&rsquo; for turning neighbourhoods into ghettos.</p>
<p>Immigration has been &#8216;too high&rsquo; for many years and has created &#8216;discomfort and disjointedness&rsquo; across the country, he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the explosive claim that Labour is to blame for allowing extremist parties such as the BNP to flourish by dismissing legitimate concerns about mass immigration as &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And he insisted that measures being implemented by the Coalition will cut immigration by up to 75 per cent from its peak. </p>
<p>He said annual net immigration levels will fall from around 200,000 in recent years to the &#8216;tens of thousands&rsquo; seen under the Thatcher and Major governments.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron spelt out a series of steps the Government is taking to bring down numbers of immigrants, including:</p>
<p>■ A limit on the number of skilled workers coming from outside Europe of  20,700 this year;</p>
<p>■ A minimum age of 21 for spouses coming to the UK;</p>
<p>■ A crackdown on student visas to cut the number issued by 80,000 a year;</p>
<p>■ Limits on &#8216;health tourism&rsquo; and illegal workers claiming benefits;</p>
<p>■ Welfare reforms to end the option of a life on the dole for British workers.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron rejected the Business Secretary&rsquo;s warnings that limiting the number of foreign workers and students risks damaging British companies and universities.</p>
<p>Immigration minister Damian Green defended the speech this morning, saying: &#8216;This is an item that people really care about and if mainstream politicians don&rsquo;t talk about it, we leave the field open to the extremists.&rsquo; </p>
<p>But the BNP claimed the Prime Minister was taking up their policy and accused him of &#8216;cynical opportunism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Spokesman Simon Darby said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s almost like a ceremonial adoption of our policy about two weeks before any major vote. In other words, he knows what ordinary British people are thinking. </p>
<p>&#8216;He completely ignores that until two weeks before a major poll and then all of a sudden starts pressing a few buttons to try and make people believe he&rsquo;s actually doing something about immigration.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s a farce, it&rsquo;s a con, and if we had copyright on our manifesto we&rsquo;d have our lawyers round his office within hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage welcomed Mr Cameron&rsquo;s admission that &#8216;mass immigration has caused division within society&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But he added: &#8216;Sadly there isn&rsquo;t much he can do about it because the elephant in the room is the European Union and we have a total open border with all of them &hellip;  We cannot have our own immigration policy and be part of the European Union.</p>
<p>Addressing party members in Hampshire, the Prime Minister insisted immigration is one of the chief concerns of voters and that it is the role of politicians to speak about it &#8216;sensibly and reasonably&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said that Britain has benefited &#8216;immeasurably&rsquo; from immigrant workers and entrepreneurs, pointing to their contribution to the NHS, schools, charities, financial services, fashion, food and music.</p>
<p>But he added: &#8216;I&rsquo;m also clear about something else: for too long, immigration has been too high.</p>
<p>&#8216;Between 1997 and 2009, 2.2million more people came to live in this country than left to live abroad. That&rsquo;s the largest influx of people Britain has ever had, and it has placed real pressures on communities up and down the country.</p>
<p>&#8216;Not just pressures on schools, housing and healthcare  &mdash;  though those have been serious  &mdash;  but social pressures too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Cameron argued that communities are &#8216;forged by friendship and conversation&rsquo;, whether on the school run or &#8216;down the pub&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;These bonds can take time, so real integration takes time,&rsquo; he added. &#8216;That&rsquo;s why, when there have been significant numbers of new people arriving in neighbourhoods, perhaps not able to speak the same language as those living there, on occasions not really wanting or even willing to integrate, that has created a kind of discomfort and disjointedness in some neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>&#8216;This has been the experience for many people in our country  &mdash;  and I believe it is untruthful and unfair not to speak about it and address it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the most provocative passage, the Prime Minister said Labour must take responsibility for the rise of the BNP, the English Defence League and other far-Right organisations.</p>
<p>&#8216;On the one hand, there were Labour ministers who closed down discussion, giving the impression that concerns about immigration were somehow racist,&rsquo; he will say.</p>
<p>&#8216;On the other, there were ministers hell-bent on burnishing their hard-line credentials by talking tough, but doing nothing to bring the numbers down.</p>
<p>&#8216;This approach had damaging consequences in terms of controlling immigration but also in terms of public debate.</p>
<p>&#8216;It created the space for extremist parties to flourish, as they could tell people that mainstream politicians weren&rsquo;t listening to their concerns or doing anything about them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister pointed out that around 75 per cent of the 2.5million jobs created since 1997 have gone to foreign-born workers.</p>
<p> &#8216;The real issue is this: migrants are filling gaps in the labour market left wide open by a welfare system that for years has paid British people not to work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;That&rsquo;s where the blame lies  &mdash;  at the door of our woeful welfare system, and the last government who comprehensively failed to reform it. We will never control immigration properly unless we tackle welfare dependency.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Overall, he insisted, the Government&rsquo;s measures will bring net migrant numbers back down to the levels of the 1990s.</p>
<p>That would mean around 50,000 immigrants a year being allowed to settle in Britain, a fall of three-quarters on the numbers seen under Labour.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes, Britain will always be open to the best and brightest from around the world and those fleeing persecution,&rsquo; he pledged.</p>
<p>&#8216;But with us, our borders will be under control and immigration will be at levels our country can manage. No ifs, no buts. That&rsquo;s a promise we made to the British people. And it&rsquo;s a promise we are keeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan Ellis from the Refugee Council claimed Mr Cameron&rsquo;s demand for migrants settling here to speak English were &#8216;completely contradicted&rsquo; by the coalition&rsquo;s cuts to funding for English language classes. </p>
<p>&#8216;We know from our experience how important it is for refugees and asylum seekers to be able to develop their English, yet many refugees, asylum seekers and migrants will be unable to afford to learn English lessons as a result of the cuts, further isolating many people from mainstream society,&rsquo; he said.</p>

		<p>There should be no non-European immigration whatsoever.  European immigration itself isn&rsquo;t really needed. In fact there are plenty of unemployed British people.  And those who do not possess the needed skills should be trained, not supplanted by non-British workers. Although this statement by the PM is better than any made by any PM in 50 years.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a case of waking up a little late.  Even if they cut it down to &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; there are already millions of non-whites all over Britain, and now seeping into the little hamlets in the countryside.  No matter what they do, in 30 years or less white Britions will be less than 40% of the population and fighting for their very lives.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the EU does or does not due regarding immigration, because their inept, stupid ruling class set destructive forces into motion years ago with their headlong rush for the joys of muliticulturalism, and it&rsquo;s too late now to change the situation without erupting into civil chaos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how it will all turn out, but I suspect there will be much fighting and bloodshed throughout all of Europe.</p>
<p>That these same delusional elites couldn&rsquo;t see this coming is truly amazing in itself.</p>
<p>The top trends forecaster, Gerald Celente, has alerted his subscribers to watch for the ongoing riots in the Middle East to spread to Europe, with France as the most likely nation to first erupt into chaos.</p>
<p>Incidentally, he forecast the Middle East riots about a year before they occurred.  He&rsquo;s also forecasting another major terrorist attack against the US either in the US or US interests overseas.</p>
<p>In his last Trends alert he said the possibility of the first great war of the 21st century is likely to occur.  I hope he&rsquo;s wrong on that one, but it isn&rsquo;t comforting to know his past forecasts have been 80% accurate.</p>

		<p> Even if the BNP leader is correct that Mr. Cameron is trying to steal his party&rsquo;s thunder on the eve of the election, it&rsquo;s still good that he spoke up and uttered some truths that are painful and unpleasant to the Laborites&rsquo; ears. I only hope that Britain hasn&rsquo;t waited too long to tackle its serious problems with excessive immigration.</p>
<p> Enoch Powell said, many years ago, that these disastrous changes in the UK would come to pass, if the government didn&rsquo;t stop letting in so many immigrants who were most assuredly not British. He was shouted down, and forced out of the Cabinet. I suspect that right now, somewhere, Mr. Powell is looking down, smiling (grimly), and saying, &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The BNP political stance is called &#8220;extremist&#8221;, and in the same breath their concerns are described as &#8220;legitimate&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would suggest that &#8216;legitimate&rsquo; means the BNP is at the political center of Britain.</p>
<p>It is the mass immigration enthusiasts who are the extremists.</p>

		<p>The only truthful part of the speech was that there is an election comming,&#8221;no ifs no buts that is a promise we make to the british people&#8221;this is another cast iron guarantee with the same credibility that the last one,on a referendum had,were he telling us the truth,both administrations of the last fourty years,would not have been determined to destroy the English people,he calls us &#8220;british&#8221;so we are well aware of who he means,and it is not the indigenous people.</p>

		<p>Perhaps I am wrong here, but the old paradigm of England making policies and rules for itself and applying those rules and policies is no longer possible? The British are now part of the EU and if the EU says you must take in so many &#8220;refugees&rsquo; and &#8220;migrants&#8221; you must do so, regardless. Your own government is no longer sovereign in these matters as it once was. The EU membership has and is a pact with the devil.</p>

		<p>It is no conincidence that David Cameron is talking tough a few weeks before crucial elections in the UK, elections in which the Conservatives are set to do badly.<br>
 Cameron is merely posturing and playing to the gallery - hoping to run down Labour on one hand and pretending to be hardline on immigration on the other.<br>
  In fact, Cameron&rsquo;s immigration proposals are largely ineffective - the vast bulk of immigration into the UK won&rsquo;t be affected by the measures.<br>
 Cameron is a political chameleon and generally unsound on &#8216;race&rsquo; and immigration issues.He is shameless enough to play to the gallery in an attempt to get a few BNP votes, butif you look at other parts of his record (eg geving billions pf pounds to fund Pakistani education whilst cutting education at home, he shows his true multiculti colours).<br>
 A man not to be trusted.</p>

<p>  I agree, Cameron&rsquo;s speech is political posturing before the electorate. He is part of the privileged global elite and can&rsquo;t be trusted. The only party that can be trusted to stop unrestricted immigration to formerly Great Britain is the British National Party. I prefer Conservatives over Labour but both are disasters as far as the key issue of immigration is concerned.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s highly unlikely that immigration will actually fall 75% under Cameron.  These are probably just lies.  Remember that as Cameron noted himself, officials in the Blair regime repeatedly made speeches promising to cut immigration, then never did anything to make it happen.    </p>
<p>Once again, we see that capitalist interests are at the forefront of the open borders movement.  </p>

		<p>In order to retain white majorities, countries like England will have to reject the authority of the EU and close their borders.</p>
<p>They will also have to find ways to deport millions of non-Europeans back to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the differential birth rates will overwhelm Europe with or without further immigration.</p>
<p>Cameron is probably just posturing:  He knows full well that the European Union is planning to accelerate third world immigration, not limit it.</p>
<p>For the full horror of what the EU has planned, see the article</p>
<p>&#8220;secret plot to let him 50 million African workers into the EU&#8221;</p>

<p>Sorry Istvan, but like those who are praising Sarkozy for cancelling the trains from Italy full of refugees from Tunisia, you are clutching at straws with your praise for Cameron. Does anyone really believe that these pro-EU governments who have for decades covertly planned and created the Marxist/globalist multicultural EU Federal Superstate, which is destroying European nation-states in the process, are now doing an about-turn and will now reverse or halt mass immigration? Of course not. </p>
<p>These Marxist/globalist fanatics will have to be removed from power kicking and screaming and are merely reacting to the rise of nationalism throughout Europe (Finland being the latest). People need to remember that playing both sides is an old Marxist tactic. If these pro-EU/One-world government politicians were to every single time appear to be against their own people and always for mass immigration then people would soon realise that they are traitors and they&rsquo;d soon be out of power. No, they play both sides to fool the people and the Third world colonisation of Europe continues apace with millions pouring in every year. Sarkozy has already banned the burqa and deported a few thousand gypsy criminals back to Romania - while the government of France has admitted that under EU law they are unable to refuse the gypsies admission if they seek to re-enter France. But none of these initiatives has had the slightest  effect on the Third World colonisation of Europe. Mass immigration continues apace. People need to understand that the pro-EU political Elite who created mass immigration and the EU Federal Superstate will never halt the colonisation of Europe but will do everything in their power to continue it and make it irreversible. Only the continuing rise of nationalist parties will halt the deliberate Third World colonisation of Eutope.</p>

		<p>I should also mention that serial backtracker Cameron has already had second thoughts and said that though these are his thoughts on immigration, they are not the policy of the coalition government. The Daily Mail, an Establishment mouthpiece, pretends to be neutral but is, in fact, rabidly pro-Conservative and pro-EU.</p>
