<h1>Being Too PC Led Us to Shelter Terrorists, Says Ex-Minister</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Bentham, This Is London, April 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Labour minister admitted today that political correctness had led Britain to offer shelter to violent extremists.</p>
<p>Kim Howells, a former Foreign Office minister, said Tony Blair&rsquo;s government and other administrations had been afraid to criticise the conduct of radical preachers and others because they feared being accused of racism.</p>
<p>He said the policy had been pursued even though there was plenty of intelligence about the &#8220;evil&#8221; intent of such extremists and that it was only reversed after the 7/7 bombings. Mr Howells also said that he had been unable to find a single imam willing to say publicly that suicide bombers would go to hell. He further criticised a reluctance in Muslim communities to condemn the &#8220;murderous actions&#8221; of terrorists.</p>
<p>His comments came as a leaked diplomatic cable, published today by WikiLeaks, revealed Britain had been warned years before the London bombings to stop giving asylum to &#8220;very dangerous&#8221; terrorists.</p>
<p>The cable, sent by a former military attach√© to the Algerian embassy in Washington on July 12 2005, told US diplomats that Britain had allowed extremists to raise money for terrorist causes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the English consider the risks of allowing Londonistan to develop?&#8221; the cable states. &#8220;The British thought that sheltering terrorists was a good solution, but they did not realise that one can never align oneself with the devil, and they did precisely that for years and years.&#8221; </p>
<p>In a BBC interview today, Mr Howells admitted that the criticism was justified.<br>

		<p>Now that the costs of hideous Diversity are mounting and can&rsquo;t be ignored, you will see more White politicians admitting that we&rsquo;ve made a terrible mistake.  Even the liberals are genuinely afraid that the Wave of Change and Transformation will crash on their households and families with as much hateful wrath as it has upon the working class.</p>
<p>Finally, liberal Whites are using their higher IQ&rsquo;s to look into the future, and they are seeing race horrors instead of just calculating political advantage and parroting all the right things, such as &#8220;all men are created equal, so we are counting on the influx of enriching Diversity to revive our country.&#8221;<br>

		<p>All men ARE created equal, however not all men ACT equal. That is where the problems of Western societies lie. We are in a sick &amp; deranged parallel universe where the assailants have more rights than victims or survivors of the victims. Hopefully these days of living in this scandalous backwards reality is coming to an end. But if we are stuck in this violent vortex of liberal licentiousness, and the inevitable &#8220;conservative&#8221; political accomplices, let us go out fighting for the most important of virtues; blood, honor and equality among the good God-faring, hard-working, unselfish virtues of White civilization. Keep the good &amp; throw out the bad. I don&rsquo;t know who said it, and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing, but: The only thing needed for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t this hypocrite say so at the time.It was glaringly obvious to anyone with half a brain cell that Labour&rsquo;s insane social engineering project was bound to render us open to all manner of subversion and cultural death,yet cowards and criminals like Howells went along with every traitorous move,lining their pockets on the way.If this man had an ounce of integrity he would offer himself to the nearest police station to be charged with high treason.</p>

<p>There is no change, there is merely &#8216;counterpropaganda&rsquo; from those who want to nullify the power of Wikileaks embarrassments by agreeing with it.  Now that it&rsquo;s too late to -do- anything about it.  And of course, without any intention of &#8216;fixing things&rsquo;.</p>
<p>1.  Have Imams been deported?  Decried?  Their mosques shut <br>
    down?  Their taxes audited?  Arrested for sedition or <br>
    supporting terrorism?<br>
2.  Has there been a serious review of Islam&rsquo;s unfortunate <br>
    effects on local Brits (as there have British Educational <br>
    and Law ideals on &#8216;poor poor put upon people of Muslim <br>
    faith&rsquo;)?<br>
3.  Is there a standing moratorium on the immigration of <br>
    foreigners or a review of the conditions of Asylum?<br>
4.  How about a sudden shutoff of the multi thousand pound <br>
    weekly allotments given to non-English speaking Ethiopian <br>
    indigents and their 11 member families?<br>
5.  Has the Schengen Compact been overturned?  (Not that Britain <br>
    ever signed but it&rsquo;s clear that the other EU members have no <br>
    intention of preventing the refugee waves from reaching <br>
    England&rsquo;s welfare state).<br>
6.  Has the idiocy of &#8216;a greater Mediterranean Union&rsquo; (I smell <br>
    fresh oil) in the colonialization of Maghreb been rendered <br>
    unnecessary?</p>
<p><br>
Obscure, distract, misdirect, contra-indicate.  It&rsquo;s all in the rotation of obfuscatory tactics.</p>

		<p>You may remember back in early 2001, President Bush vowed to end racial profiling in his first State of the Union address. In 2003, he acted on his promise by issuing an order to 70 federal law enforcement agencies calling for an end to most forms of racial and ethnic profiling.</p>
<p>Even though the Executive Order on racial profiling came after 9/11/2001, I always felt there was a de-facto type &#8220;this is what the boss wants&#8221; mentality in the Federal Government on racial profiling. What can explain the attitude toward FBI warnings about Muslims attending flight schools?</p>
<p>Even the August 6th, 2001 presidential briefing titled &#8216;bin-Laden Determined to Strike in US&rsquo; seems to have been met with a shrug of the shoulders under Bush.</p>
<p>George Tenet and Richard Clarke warned Condi Rice in a July 2001 meeting about al-Quada activities. Surely Condi must have told the Decider guy. Then again, he was Incurious George.</p>

		<p>Stupidity is natural or even accidental; evil is calculated.<br>
Stupidity on a mass scale from supposedly well-educated and well-heeled politicians in a first-world nation such as Great Britain is impossible, unless they are soul-less Marxist creeps in suited disguise.<br>
They have nothing but utter contempt for the white British working class; they don&rsquo;t even care whether they get raped, bashed, stabbed or even killed by aliens, unless of course their ability to work in a factory is compromised.<br>
Then, if one of the underlings dares to object, they can be arrested in the middle of the night and taken to the watch-house for a suspected &#8216;hate-crime.&rsquo;<br>
After that, you might not even have your factory job to go back to.</p>

		<p>Some Definitions of &ldquo;Political Correctness&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Establishing a double standard.&rdquo; [This is what results from P.C., but is not P.C. itself.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crusade to ignorance characterized by a rejection of truth that conflicts with ideology.&rdquo; [The best so far.]</p>
<p>Political Correctness as Government Censorship</p>
<p>Censorship, or government suppression of individual speech, has taken many forms over the years. In times past, government censors banned certain books and movies. Today, the new form of censorship is popularly known as &ldquo;political correctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Traditional morality of a person used to be determined by his actions. Now it is judged by the political causes he supports. </p>
<p>Political correctness is a &ldquo;secular&rdquo; dogma that defines as morally wrong any opposition to the myriad of socially liberal/Leftist causes. Political correctness often asserts itself in school systems in active discouragement of, or open hostility to, opposing views on these and other controversial issues. This is clearly the antithesis of the &ldquo;freedom of speech&rdquo; protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Political correctness is not a new phenomenon. Those familiar with Hans Christian Anderson&rsquo;s &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes&#8221; will recognize it as the theme of the story. Everyone was told by the con artist supposedly making the clothes that if they couldn&rsquo;t see them, they [including the emperor] were unworthy of their position. Everyone praised the emperor&rsquo;s clothes when in fact he was naked, and everyone knew it. And so it is today in what is supposed to be the freest country on earth. No matter what position you hold, be it student, teacher, employee, civil servant, company CEO, politician, you are required to patronize certain ideas, or risk losing your position for being unworthy.</p>
<p>Political Correctness as Self-Censorship</p>
<p>Since public schools were established to promote knowledge and seek truth, anyone who disagrees with it is naturally looked upon as unenlightened, uneducated, and an outcast &hellip; especially when the subject involves the feelings of others. Who wants that stigma? No one, so political correctness with the educational system behind it becomes a particularly insidious form of censorship because it forces the individual to pretend he doesn&rsquo;t know something he does, namely that the ideology being promoted is not true. </p>
<p>What value does one add to what is supposed to be a creative process if he is saying the same thing everyone else is? Who needs him?<br>

You really believe that ALL men are CREATED equal? Not so and never was so. </p>
<p>It is a BIG lie that has become PC in the Churches today and in the media and academia.</p>
<p>One only has to look at genetics, culture, behaviors and IQ among the races to see this is not so. </p>
<p>BTW, when the Founders stated this, they were ONLY speaking to the White race as &#8220;all men&#8221;. There were no mention or faces of the Chinese, the Mexican, nor Blacks in the equation whatsoever. </p>

		<p>Anonymous- I guess my point may have been missed on you. No big deal.<br>
When I say that all men are created equally, I am willing to give people of all races the benefit of the doubt. Or at least I used to. But when evil and ghastly actions are portrayed by said individuals, in my eyes, and in most of common sense societies&rsquo; eyes, they cease to be equal. However, they still are men. Or women. But not fit to live with the rest of society as a whole. Good enough explanation? It so happens to be these days that blacks, (and to some extent mestizos &amp; Arabs) are a direct threat to Western values, and aren&rsquo;t worthy of being equal by today&rsquo;s standards. These also happen to be the poster children minorities of the left. And the 3 groups most responsible for crime in Western societies.</p>

		<p>Poster number 8 is correct:<br>
The idea of any sort of equality on the face of this Earth is a figment of the human imagination, a complete delusion. This inequality is everywhere around you and visible and obvious to anyone with eyes in their head, and a brain to process what those eyes see. Believing that all people are equal is the virtual equivilant of thinking that a lion is equal to the antelope that it kills; all the way down to the equality of the worm that the magpie has just pulled out of the ground.<br>
Probably the biggest example of nature&rsquo;s inequality is evident within mankind itself. Inequality insofar as the huge abyss between the genius and the retard in an advanced society. Then we have the bigger abyss in a collective way between the primitive peoples and the advanced.<br>
The churches, academic intellectuals, antifa, your government (where ever you live), the printed media and of course the television are lying to us!</p>
