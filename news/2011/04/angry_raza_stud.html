			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dave Gibson, Examiner, April 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A mob of both students and adults angry over the impending vote by the Tucson school board to make Raza studies or Mexican-American studies an elective, rather than forcing children to take the race-based curriculum rushed into the meeting room, chaining themselves to chairs.</p>
<p>Police simply stood by and watched as the loud mob took-over the room and refused to leave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the textbooks they use is titled &#8220;Occupied America,&#8221; which was written by Rodolfo Acu√±a and includes a speech given by activist and university professor Jose Angel Gutierrez in which he says: &#8220;We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him,&#8221; (pg. 323).</p>
<p>The book also talks about the need for Mexico to re-take seven states in the Southwestern United States.</p>
<p>The following rather shocking quotes are taken directly from Occupied America (pg. 167):</p>
<p>&#8220;Supporters would execute all white males over age 16,&#8221; (also known as the Plan of San Diego).</p>
<p>&#8220;The Southwest would become a Chicano nation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I emailed the President of the school disrict stating my disbelief that any school district in the United States would be teaching students from a textbook of this kind. It is absolutely un-American and goes against our values as a sovereign nation. This might be a book that is used in Mexico, but not in our country. How can this be?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Tucson, and I taught Mexicans in Occupied El Paso.</p>
<p>IF the State of Arizona, or the TUSD school board forces White students to take a mandatory Mexican Studies course, the best thing is for the Whites to behave exactly the way Mexicans do when they are &#8220;forced&#8221; to attend English language classes.</p>
<p>Okay kids, here&rsquo;s how you beat the system:</p>
<p>When you enter the classroom, socialize with your friends and ignore the teacher.<br>
Whenever the teacher gives you a handout, dramatically rip it in half and throw it on the floor. <br>
Get out of your seat and wander around the room.<br>
Stick chewing gum onto the decorative bulletin boards.<br>
Write profanities on any student papers the teacher has put on display.<br>
When asked a direct question, tell the teacher you don&rsquo;t know the answer.<br>
Make it a point to tell the teacher that you hate him/her because you&rsquo;re White and he&rsquo;s not.<br>
Refuse to read aloud from the textbook when called upon.<br>
Boycott all in-class assignments. Homework? Same thing.<br>
Occasionally sit at the teacher&rsquo;s desk or podium. Refuse to get out until the 3rd or 4th time you&rsquo;re asked.<br>
When reprimanded by the teacher for you bad behavior, yell out, &#8220;You&rsquo;re a racist who doesn&rsquo;t like me because I&rsquo;m White.&#8221;</p>
<p>Believe me, after about 6 weeks of this sort of behavior, TUSD will have a whole string of faculty members covering the Mexican Studies classes during their prep periods, for extra cash. The Mexican teachers will dread it, and the White teachers will find a strange rapport with the students. </p>
<p>The Mexican kids will find out how White kids feel during English class!</p>

		<p>Let them demonstrate till they drop. If they want something then let them pay for it themselves. The real idea they have is for others to subsidize them via the tax system. They should pay more for all the benefits they receive in the US. <br>
They can chain themselves to chairs all they want; they&rsquo;ll unlock the chains when they get hungry. <br>

		<p>If these people were serious about the southwest becoming a Mexican nation (there is no such thing as a Chicano as other Spanish speaking Americans would happily wage war to drive them out of our country&hellip;..there is NO solidarity that word implies).  If they wanted their own country carved out of the US, they would replace all the American institutions.  They would farm the land, to produce their own food, create their own money, and build every needful thing of life.</p>
<p>None of them do any of that.  Not a single Mexican.  NO ONE.</p>
<p>Instead, they want American welfare.  They want white people to build their homes and give them the land with everything built on it.  They want white people to grow their food and give it to them (do they want us to chew it for them first).  They want us to build their cars and, hey, while we are at it, maintain every little thing to make sure there is gas at the gas station.</p>
<p>They want whites to work all day so that they don&rsquo;t have to.  And the very last thing they want is separation from us.  Indeed, they are chasing us, as whites flee the neighborhoods they blight.</p>
<p>This situation only exists because we have a money based culture.  If you have money, no one questions your right to show up at the grocery store and buy your share of food to take home or your right to live in an apartment you are renting.  It is assumed you &#8220;did your share&#8221; and that money stands as witness to it.</p>
<p>None of those Mexicans ever did anything to earn a single cent.  Instead, our government hands it over to them as welfare.  Treats them as poor people in need.  Obviously, they view the situation VERY differently.</p>
<p>This is also their Achilles heel.  None of them want to work.  They certainly have not the slightest bit of interest at all&hellip;.I mean NONE&hellip;..in nation building.  Shut down all welfare to the southwest. Just turn it off.  When they show up at the ATM to use their cards, they simply don&rsquo;t work.  A handful might try to get a job.  There has always been a handful that will work (but only as a part of OUR economic system&hellip;NEVER to build their own economic system).  Then a larger handful will complain there are no jobs.  But that won&rsquo;t last long.  Once it became clear that they were responsible for providing for themselves, they&rsquo;d leave this country so fast it will amaze everyone.</p>
<p>So&hellip;..why hasn&rsquo;t our government done this?  Are they about to do this, might be a better question.  Certainly, Congress is dancing around the issue and has for most of Obama&rsquo;s term.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;ve never quite understood this.  Imagine you are a greedy corporatist who cares nothing for people except for the wealth they can put in your pocket.  You are capable of and have, in the past, cheerfully murdered hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, for little more reason than they were in your way, as your war/profit machine chomped up their country for its wealth.  You own the money supply.  You own the government.  You own everything.  Not only is your power not contestable, you have in place a massive brainwashing apparatus that prevents anyone from even noticing this.  People cheerfully go about their lives as your slaves, working all day long, sacrificing their very personhood, for you, and don&rsquo;t even notice their slavery&hellip;..or that you profit from it all.</p>
<p>Now here comes a huge group of disrespectful people from a country with no power to speak of.  One of your slave states (real slavery&hellip;.not its mind control cousin you use for whites) you suck oil out of and maintain a smaller scale of drug production on the side (mostly so you can get good cocaine for your lavish parties with other elites).  And these&hellip;..people, come into the part of the world you&rsquo;ve set aside to maintain a high class existence and start making all sorts of demands on the government you own, lock stock and barrel.</p>
<p>I have to tell you.  If I was that guy, I&rsquo;d wipe out 90% of the Mexican population and slap the remaining 10% in chains.  If for no other reason than make it perfectly crystal clear to everyone in the world that I can.</p>
<p>So why do our elites tolerate this?  Money?  These guys cost money.  And besides, when they want money, they print up whatever they need.  Power?  I haven&rsquo;t seen any Mexicans in jackboots with a New World Order patch on their jackets recently.  Slaves?  A handful of Mexicans work, the rest do not.  Plus, it is far more convenient to keep the slaves in Mexico&hellip;..where the beatings, rapes, and mass murder of those who get out of line, never reach the light of day.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is use of these people to displace blacks (another problem population I don&rsquo;t get why our elites tolerate the slightest bit of shenanigans from).</p>

		<p>Diffferent races have different ideas as to what constitutes an education and a culture.  As Whites are replaced in the USA by third world people, there will be more and more pressure to toss out old &#8220;European&#8221; methods and customs, and replace them with the methods and customs of the Third World.  </p>

What, no arrests?  No deportations?  No  <i>nada</i>?</p>
<p>Our spineless, lily-livered authorities have been backing down and backing down, giving in to &#8220;minority&#8221; demands,  for 2 or 3 generations now. They are desperate to avoid any violence. Their antagonists know that and capitalize on it to the fullest. </p>
<p>I tell you, this is going to get ugly.  The longer it is put off, the worse it is going to be. <br>
 <br>
Like bullies and blackmailers, they will push you just as far as they think they can go. Eventually, you have to confront them.  Appeasement does not work!  </p>

<p>What do they say about the white women?  I don&rsquo;t here any feminists angry over this either (again).  Its okay to eradicate the white race and enslave white women when its a minority.  But if ONE white guy cracks a sexist joke at work, its the end of the world.</p>
<p>These people are mad it is only an elective?  It shouldn&rsquo;t be an option.  I wish us whites could have a class about our greatness and constantly drill the Knoxville horrors, Kansas City massacre, etc. into the minds of our children.</p>
<p>A blind man can see where this is going, why can&rsquo;t these people for amnesty or immigration?  I have decided that they are all not that stupid and the only conclusion is those that want third world immigration seriously hate America.</p>

		<p>Notice the very weak pretense of &#8220;balance&#8221; in the television news report, with 90% of the coverage devoted to the protesters, including the idiotic statement by the old man in the parking lot about a &#8220;minority imposing its will on a majority&#8221; and a very weak statement read off at the end from a school official. Typical cowardly television reporting by a station terrified of offending its precious &#8220;minorities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is one more aspect of the War against White (and Black) America, and those in political power in the U.S. not only do nothing to stop it, but work to enhance the conflict.  As such, our leaders guarantee us a future in which we will eventually fight a bloody civil war, resulting in the loss of the U.S. as a nation-state.  The combined nations of the world could not have beaten us from the outside.  We were defeated from within by traitors who loved money and self-aggrandizement more than they loved their nation.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been pointing out for years the dangers of the Latinos flooding into this nation. Very frequently do I feel like Laocoon. Many people I know (including family) are incredibly naive with this influx, insisting the same &ldquo;they are just trying to make their lives better&rdquo; not seeing the writing on the wall. They aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo; they are our replacements!<br>
They aren&rsquo;t poor huddled masses trying to fit in and not be noticed by big mean white people, they are invaders, and they know this. They are creeping farther and farther North, now reaching the northern border! Towns that have been lily white for centuries, ever since their creation, are now suffering the major problems of Latinos for the first time. They come in, have ridiculously large families, use the local welfare until there isn&rsquo;t anything left, flood the cathedrals, neighborhoods, parks, recreational facilities, etc and will gladly push away whites. Once the whites give up and leave, they turn the city into another Mexico and then move onto the next white city. Just look at California!<br>
What were once Victorian structures on old village main streets are now haphazardly remodeled fiesta color nightmares, what were once beautiful gothic churches are now Mexican disasters, and what were once 19th century neighborhoods are now favelas!<br>
If ever we reclaim this land, there won&rsquo;t be much left to reclaim in Mexican occupied cities. <br>
Until the day Americans turn back the tide of invaders, I will continue like most whites, to flee the invasion, but the difference between most whites and me is that I will willingly point out what we are running from.<br>

		<p>1-June: &#8220;This might be a book that is used in Mexico, but not in our country. How can this be?&#8221;: My response to June is that Tucson is no longer truly a part of &#8220;our country&#8221;. It is currently one of the battle fronts in the continuing Mexican-American War, which is being won by Mexico. Again, they couldn&rsquo;t beat us in a straight-up military fight, but they are defeating us through migration and subsequent displacement of White (and Black) people, and all with the aid and abetment of our own treasonous politicians.</p>

		<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s a good idea that the Plan of San Diego is talked about in some depth.  Let&rsquo;s take a brief look at wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_of_San_Diego" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_of_San_Diego</a></p>
<p>It called for the recruitment of native Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and native Americans to rebel against the white population of the border states by killing every male of sixteen and above within a set period of time, essentially starting a race war.</p>
<p>However, some white residents blamed local Mexican Americans for the raids and attacked them, killing somewhere between 300 and 5,000, before U.S. Army troops put an end to the violence. After these attacks, Mexican Americans in south Texas were disenfranchised and subjected to segregation.</p>

<p> <br>
Why wouldn&rsquo;t they back down?  Nobody here was there to object. We have offered no consequences  to those who back down and no reward or safety for those who stand up. We are hardly a voice and even less of a presence in this or any other formerly functioning nation. </p>
<p>They make demands. We write angry letters. </p>
<p>They protest  in public. We complain here in private. </p>
<p>That our leaders back down is our fault. We have never offered protection. Instead we have failed to stand up to the mobs that bully and degrade OUR leaders. We can not continue to criticize our leaders and public figures with out realizing, we too are guilty of backing down and giving in to &ldquo;minority&ldquo; demands. Shame on us! <br>
We can&rsquo;t even organize ourselves to hold our leaders responsible even when we feel they&rsquo;ve failed us. They have every right to turn on us? </p>
<p>There can be no government without a body to govern. The voices that cry loudest are those that are heard and whom governments are formed around. If we remain silent, we do not exist.</p>

		<p>To poster #4 - you would need to shut down welfare to the entire nation, because if you only do it in the SW, they will migrate to the other regions of the U.S.</p>
<p>And Mexico is something like the 15th richest nation on Earth, and boasts the richest man in the world.  The Mexicans who come here are the dirt poor uneducated Indians who are on the bottom in Mexico.</p>
<p>Until there is &#8216;social justice&rsquo; in Mexico, they will never stop coming here for the freebies, so all freebies must end, even though it will hurt legitimate poor Americans.</p>

<p>I am one of those &#8220;poor&#8221; White Americans who worked and paid taxes for 40 years. Now that I am older, there is not much left over for me. It is due to the nonwhites/immigrants in this country who get much of the pie and never paid taxes at all or very little all their lives. If it were only Whites getting the &#8220;freebies&#8221; that most of us paid for in the first place, there would be no problem. When a country allows millions upon millions of nonwhite foreigners into their nation this is when the problem begins. </p>
<p>And yes, they will stop coming here when we get the cajones to stop them all and deport 95% of them out of this country! Why should any natural born white citizen have to suffer &#8220;because the traitors allowed them into our sovereign nation? </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Frankly, I&rsquo;ve never quite understood this. Imagine you are a greedy corporatist who cares nothing for people except for the wealth they can put in your pocket. You are capable of and have, in the past, cheerfully murdered hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, for little more reason than they were in your way, as your war/profit machine chomped up their country for its wealth. You own the money supply. You own the government. You own everything. Not only is your power not contestable, you have in place a massive brainwashing apparatus that prevents anyone from even noticing this. People cheerfully go about their lives as your slaves, working all day long, sacrificing their very personhood, for you, and don&rsquo;t even notice their slavery&hellip;..or that you profit from it all.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Some thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>1.  These people live in a world (as synthetic as that of the stereotype middle American couch potato) where values of competition with each other, exceed the values of sustaining a liveable environment.  To them, the environment is a ski lodge or luxury apartment or board room or speaking podium at a high ticket dinner.  They don&rsquo;t see beyond that and, as yet, they don&rsquo;t see the sea-change in the colors of the faces at those composiums where traditional liberal/profiteerist motives speak loudly.  When a rich Mexican stands up and says: &#8220;Yeah, we&rsquo;ve already got power, now what do you have to offer us?&#8221;, it will be too late.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
So why do our elites tolerate this? Money? These guys cost money. And besides, when they want money, they print up whatever they need. Power? I haven&rsquo;t seen any Mexicans in jackboots with a New World Order patch on their jackets recently. Slaves? A handful of Mexicans work, the rest do not. Plus, it is far more convenient to keep the slaves in Mexico&hellip;..where the beatings, rapes, and mass murder of those who get out of line, never reach the light of day.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>2.  I doubt if most have seen the darkside of Mexico outside a resort town.  Heck, I doubt if most have even seen a resort town.  That&rsquo;s not the place that rich politicos go to rub shoulders with their fellow snobs.  At the same time, so long as we pay for the social entitlements, the only thing the invading colonizers do is energize the system with an overlapping layer of ethnic foods and cheap salary jobs.  Things like reverse currency flow to Mexico and brutal conditions for whites who are only valuable as long as they -have to- stick within the (decaying) boundaries of the existing system don&rsquo;t matter because we have no where to go.  And anything which puts more U.S. currency into the system ensures that flow of currency hides value of currency trading via protective interest rates and the like.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The only thing I can think of is use of these people to displace blacks (another problem population I don&rsquo;t get why our elites tolerate the slightest bit of shenanigans from).<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>3.  Blacks without jobs already will only be forced deeper into welfare which means more taxes (harvesting more saved = static money into the system) and more consumerism.  Whoohoo!  Displace them FASTER!  Our profits will surge!</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br>
The one group an elite cannot afford to irritate is another group of elites who, having &#8216;made it&rsquo; in their own depraved and impoverished landscape, have no place left to grow into.  Such tension leads to regional hegemonies of alliance based economics and lost resources.  This is particularly true if resource costs can be (falsely, blatantly) leveraged to remain the same, allowing trades of power and influence for cheap labor which is &#8216;infinitely scaleable&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What will stop this arrogance is the depletion of those resources and the arrival of robotics.  Once resources become finite and diminishing in a big way, it will no longer pay to dig stuff up in one corner of the world and ship it around the planet through a dozen different, intermediate, process steps where &#8216;everybody&rsquo; (elite) gets their cut.</p>
<p>Once robotics come online in a -serious- (anthropomorphic) way, human labor will lose it&rsquo;s final &#8216;for nothing&rsquo; scalar factor.</p>
<p>At that point, free enterprise will collapse because the only people who own the -hardware- for these systems of commerce will be overseas and they will want all remaining (petro and mineral and lumber and silver and copper etc.) supplies to accrue to them.  The consumerist &#8216;demand&rsquo; of supplyside economics will mean nothing.</p>
<p>Centrist Distributionism will fall on it&rsquo;s face and the elites who look to chase power into new capitalist environments which they have shaped will find that they and their worthless bank accounts buy them nothing in a land where REAL POWER comes from being accepted as the devil you know.  Because you look like them.</p>
<p>And we will laugh.  Because it won&rsquo;t matter if you are black, asian, white or latino.  America will be such a mess of racial Balkanization that no one will want to come and sell here and no individual power base will remain, large enough for (present) white elites to rule.</p>

		<p>I lived in Tucson not too long ago (moved out less than six years ago). It didn&rsquo;t seem that bad at the time. The Mexicans were mostly confined to the south side of the city.</p>
<p>Apparently, it&rsquo;s gotten a lot worse. Obama and his relentless pandering to illegal aliens is likely a factor. It&rsquo;s made them louder and more aggressive.</p>
<p>Where are the voices of protest, besides on sites like Amren? This brown mestizo/Aztec mob is chanting for our race-replacement. Yet there seems to be no opposition from &#8220;mainstream&#8221; society&hellip;which will be race-replaced just as surely as we will be.</p>

		<p>And yet again, someone here fantasizes about a white/black alliance against Hispanics. Have we forgotten the Knoxville Horror? The Wichita Massacre? The epidemic of black-on-white crime, including black males raping white women?</p>
<p>No one but me (so far) has objected to this black/white alliance fantasy. Now Asians commit very little crime against white victims. And yet when I suggest that whites and Asians work together on certain issues&hellip;not any kind of formal alliance, and I certainly don&rsquo;t encourage white/Asian sexual mixing, just working together when it suits the both of us&hellip;I get called a race traitor. Go figure.</p>
<p>Maybe some very misguided whites WANT blacks around because they KNOW blacks are less intelligent and therefore won&rsquo;t be competition for jobs, etc. The problem, of course, even though that&rsquo;s true, is that blacks are killing whites at an astonishingly high rate. The 9/11 attacks transformed the country. 3000 Americans were killed. Yet in 2001 alone, 9000 white Americans were murdered by blacks. Why has THAT not transformed our nation and led to new social and legal policies?</p>
<p>Or maybe they&rsquo;re just from the dumber half of the white population and realize they can&rsquo;t compete with other whites. If that&rsquo;s true they&rsquo;re selling their race out just to promote their own selfish interests.</p>
<p>Our Mexican problem is a serious one, but the white man is capable of solving it without their &#8220;help&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The Raza mob will get its way sooner or later. This is how the left took over the liberal arts departments in the universities. They didn&rsquo;t do it with polite debates and rational discussions where they were careful not to offend anyone. They did it by staging riots, sit-ins, taking over campus buildings, disrupting lectures and all the rest of it. They use these techniques because they work. The school administrators just give in eventually to gain some peace and quiet. Blacks use this technique all the time as well. They get in people&rsquo;s faces and shout  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve seen this happen over and over again, and the result is always the same. Capitulation. There is only one way to fight back against this stuff and it has nothing to do with reasoned arguments.</p>

		<p>Some excellent suggestions from TeaMan at #2, but the Latino youth and their enablers would doubtless find such reciprocity racist, or at least &#8220;unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to comprehend, or even believe, the small-mindedness of these people and their concept of what constitutes fairness. The kinds of things a well-adjusted white kid has outgrown before starting kindergarten dominate the thought processes of even relatively well-educated Latinos. They want what they want when they want it, and anyone who refuses to give it to them is unfair and/or doesn&rsquo;t like them. They memorize a few slogans and talking points, and drag them out over and over while asserting their mindless demands.</p>
<p>As with a spoiled toddler, the best thing anyone could do would be to give them a good whacking. We white people don&rsquo;t do things that way anymore, which really limits the range of effective responses. So, like spoiled toddlers they&rsquo;ll continue to make their noises and demand their demands, ever emboldened by our lack of effective response.</p>

Trust me, I hold no desire for any such white/black alliance.  I believe you read a little more into my comments than I had intended to express.  As such, I do not take your comments personally.  In fact, in viewing your statements from as objective a point of view as I can, I mostly agree with your observations. I&rsquo;m not sure about the view regarding working with Asians, as it seems to me if we are race-replaced by any group, the end result is the same.</p>

		<p>I Am The Devil wrote eloquently about our situation, and I believe he&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s not just holding our elected officials responsible, but each one of us who has failed to act, failed to speak, failed to do. </p>
<p>He says: &#8220;There can be no government without a body to govern. The voices that cry loudest are those that are heard and whom governments are formed around. If we remain silent, we do not exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I for one wish to exist in that respect.  I wish to stand and be counted&hellip;but I&rsquo;m not a leader. If I stand, it will be one woman standing. Yeah&hellip;that&rsquo;s going to be heard. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, organizing us is like herding cats. Forget the fact that the moment anything surfaces, the FBI will be profiling us as a white hate group and many will flee. Forget that people&rsquo;s passion will wane when it costs something besides paying an internet bill so we can sit in comfort and complain here. Forget that the cost in dollars, of action now, will be outweighed by the cost in dollars later because of our inaction. </p>
<p>There is no polarizing, central leader whom all others will agree to follow. Each individual is going to try to put his own spin, add his own extra agenda, make his own changes. And the ensuing chaos will destroy us. We fail to lead, yet we refuse to follow. And in that break-down of cohesion, the adversaries of all that is good and right about America; envisioned by white people, engineered by white people, and crafted by white people&hellip;those adversaries will be there to benefit from the chaos, that inability of ours to find, support and stand behind and beside a leader.  </p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d envy blacks. But right this moment, I envy that they have their Jesse Jackson, their Louis Farrakhan, their Al Sharpton. Like it or not, these men are beacons that bring the bodies to a central place and raise a ruckus. And we don&rsquo;t have that. We don&rsquo;t even know where to start. We&rsquo;re so damn afraid of being called racists and endangering jobs and social standing, that we sit placidly for the slaughter. </p>
<p>And the eight of you who post as &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; know exactly what I mean. Often, the most indignant and scornful posts are done anonymously. Well I&rsquo;m NOT anonymous. My real name&rsquo;s posted here. It&rsquo;s a start. I have a job to lose and bills to pay, and a life that is just as valuable to me as yours is to you. I don&rsquo;t want to lose those things either. At some point we have to be willing to step out from behind the curtain. </p>
<p>It may sound melodramatic, but I&rsquo;m seeking a leader. I may not find him here&hellip;but someday, one will step forward. And mine will be one of the shouting, protesting, sign-wielding bodies in the crowd. I hope some of you are alongside me instead of sitting at your computers, posting on AmRen about how we&rsquo;re doing it all wrong. </p>

No.  The blacks will be given more and more Affirmative Action, in order to avert black riots.  Meanwhile, the whites will be forced into  welfare or into holding extra  jobs and working longer hours in order to pay those higher taxes that pay the welfare and sustain the do-nothing Affirmative action jobs. </p>
<p>Since whites don&rsquo;t riot or form racial pressure groups that make demands, white interests will be the easiest to ignore.</p>

<p>I agree with you. I have become very frustrated because it seems that a movement for White advocacy does not exist and we Whites are afraid to create one. </p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t take a heck of a lot of White people to start it and continue it. All changes in America resulted from a small group of people who were relentess and consistent.</p>
<p>I believe we have to go out into the streets and peacefully express our cause. Also, we need to begin to use the legal system as they do. These Latinos will never stop trying to replace our Western culture with their Latin American culture.</p>
<p>Somewhere out there there has to be charismatic white people who can step forward and guide us and others who can somehow get our message out there despite the limitations that the mainstream media would place upon us.  </p>
<p>If you are out there, please come forward. If hundreds of us begin to defend our own when we are attacked, more Whites will see this and join our White advocacy movement. But we need people out there who are initially brave enough to take this enormous risk. </p>
<p>We need some leaders and then the followers will come. (I believe I fall under the follower category. But that&rsquo;s OK. There have always been more leaders than followers!)</p>

		<p>The poster above are correct: it&rsquo;s time for a Great Leader to arise and our job will be to follow him. Fascism? Yes, of course. Will we have to change our viewpoint about ourselves and our history to survive? No doubt. Is it worth it? Why yes - as Jefferson said, the first law of morality is survival. You can&rsquo;t follow the Ten Commandments or enjoy the Bill of Rights if you aren&rsquo;t there to begin with. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the word Fascism, then let&rsquo;s call it Monarchy. That&rsquo;s actually giving away some of our rights since Fascism can be Democratic, but if that&rsquo;s what people need then so be it.

		<p> The Federal Government showed it&rsquo;s hand of turning on the American White race on Sep. 24, 1957. President Eisenhower sent fully armed combat troops from the 82nd Airborne from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to Little Rock, Arkansas to quell unarmed civilians that were protesting the Brown V Board of Education decision.<br>
 Their stance has not changed in over a half century except to be even more anti white. The Federal Government will never allow the white race to rise as a force ever again. <br>
 Affirmative action to every race on the planet against whites. The power behind the throne? I haven&rsquo;t a clue; but eventually they will win. We are being forced to pay for our own demise.<br>
 Even well armed civilians do not stand a chance against the omnipotence of the American military.<br>

		<p>@ #23: Nothing personal against you. Other people here HAVE openly called for the black/white alliance, and it WAS personal against THEM.</p>
<p>As for the Asian issue, I think a fair and just policy would be for the U.S. to have the same policy on Asian immigration as Japan does on white immigration. The tiny amount of white foreigners that Japan lets in does the Japanese nation-state and culture no harm.</p>
<p>And as for race-replacement, everyone talks about brown and yellow race-replacement because it&rsquo;s happening through immigration and is the easiest to see. But let&rsquo;s not forget that the first race-replacement in America was done by white elite slave-traders and the Southern white elite plantation owners. Potential free white labor was race-replaced by black slaves imported from Africa. And in the Civil War, those rich white plantation owners, through a combination of force and brainwashing, led hundreds of thousands of poor white Southerners to die for a cause that did not benefit them and actually hurt them. &#8220;A rich man&rsquo;s war and a poor man&rsquo;s fight.&#8221; The slave-traders then were what George Soros is now. The plantation owners then were what greedy, cheap-labor-loving big businesses are now.</p>
<p>The problem is (and again, I&rsquo;m not making a statement against you personally) that too many White Race Realists believe that blacks are somehow True Americans, that Modern White America really does owe them something. But the truth is blacks were brought here to race-replace whitey in the name of cheap labor, just as is being done with Mexicans now. A black is no more &#8220;deserving&#8221; of being an American citizen than a Mexican. And the fact that blacks were brought here against their will is all the more reason they should have been sent back when emancipated. (Of course, it&rsquo;s far too late to do that now. That genie is out of the bottle).</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been able to think out any solution to<br>
the terrible problem offered by the presence of the<br>
Ne**o on this continent. He is here and can neither<br>
be killed nor driven away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I am in NO position to lose my job and pension AND have my reputation ruined by being labeled a racist, hater or Nazi, assuring that I will never work again.  And, don&rsquo;t tell me it doesn&rsquo;t happen because it does.  And it would to me.</p>
<p>Many of us, like me, who cannot speak out, rant and rave here (or so I&rsquo;ve been accused) but we also DONATE to sites that promote our views.  </p>
<p>DO YOU?</p>
<p>Money is what allows sites like AmRen to stay open. Without these sites, we are toast, at the mercy of the government-controlled media.  There will be NO organizing or exchange of ideas for us without the Internet. Already, a number of valuable blogs have disappeared, or been &#8220;disappeared:&#8221;  Carrie&rsquo;s Nation, the Kvetcher, Nation of Cowards, South Africa Sucks, and The Thug Report.  </p>
<p>Our movement receives NO government or corporate money or &#8220;donations&#8221;, unlike our enemies. Mr. Brimelow at VDare.com, at the moment, is seeking not 30 million in donations but $30,000, a fraction of what the $PLC receives every year.  His largest, most consistent donor pulled out last year and Mr. Brimelow has been reduced to begging, while threatening to let VDare go dark permanently:</p>
<p><i>VDARE.com is finally just over half-way to its Spring fundraising goal of $30,000&hellip;.The pace of donations is slowing again.</i></p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t come on here to scold us for not marching in the streets (as operatives for the $PLC take down our license plate numbers, threaten us, call our employers, shove cameras in our faces to intimidate us and the willing media portray us as White Supremacists).</p>
<p>We are not &#8220;doing it&#8221; wrong.  We are connecting here.  We are learning that there are many of us out there behind keyboards who feel the same exact way we do, that WE are normal and not psychotic or mentally ill (as the media and government tell us) for wising to preserve our race and not be race-replaced in our homeland.</p>
<p>And, many of us quietly donate, even very small amounts.</p>
<p>But it takes money as much as activism to throw off the shackles of the PC Reign of Terror. And, it takes getting the word out without threat to our livelihoods.</p>

<p>Yes, and all the more so when whites have been reduced to a minority as well.</p>
<p>They say the squeakiest wheel gets the grease,  but whites don&rsquo;t squeak.</p>

<p>They flee Mexico because it is a H on Earth.</p>
<p>Then they want to change America into what they left.</p>
<p>Do I have this right?</p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>

		<p>Correction!!</p>
<p>On my previous post I wrote &#8220;We need some leaders and then the followers will come. (I believe I fall under the follower category. But that&rsquo;s OK. There have always been more leaders than followers!)&#8221;</p>
<p>I meant to say &#8220;There have always been more followers than leaders!&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Sorry for the confusion!</p>

 Perhaps we should consider moving to a country which will remain white in future generations (Russia,Ukraine, &hellip;Canada?).</p>
<p> Some say we should stay and fight &hellip;but if we leave in large numbers, we will survive and their system will collapse.</p>

<p>These people in the video have no respect for America and especially no respect for white people.</p>
<p>They believe they can do whatever they want and why not? The police are afraid of them and white people in general allow themselves to be intimidated by people with a Latin American mindset.</p>
<p>If we whites don&rsquo;t (peacefully) fight back soon, in the streets, we will all soon be living in a Mexico and WE and our grandchildren will be subject to them!<br>

You say, &#8220;If we whites don&rsquo;t (peacefully) fight back soon, in the streets&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>How is that even done? There is no such thing as a &#8220;peaceful&#8221; way to fight back. The laws are stacked against us. It is far too late for that. Do you think mexicans are going to let any Whites march or protest in OUR own streets? Look at what they mexicans) do when just a few Whites (WN&rsquo;s) show up to protest illegal immigration!  Let alone peacefully? </p>
