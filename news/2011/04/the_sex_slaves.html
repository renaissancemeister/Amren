<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42253545/ns/us_news-enslaved_in_america/">The Sex Slaves Next Door: New Form of Trafficking Invades US</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Azriel James Relph, MSNBC, March 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cristina was just 24 years-old, living in a rural farming village in Mexico, when Amador Cortes-Meza told her he was falling in love with her.  He promised her marriage and a good job, and then brought her to the United States.  But when she arrived in the Atlanta area, he physically abused her and forced her to work as a prostitute.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s when I realized he was not telling me the truth,&#8221; said Cristina (not her real name). &#8220;A man who loves a woman would not make them do that. I lived under his humiliation, I lived under the beatings, under the fear, there was nothing I could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is an example of an insidious form of slavery spreading across the United States  &mdash;  prostitution operations that traffic in women and children from Latin America.</p>
<p>In these operations, &#8220;closed-network&#8221; houses of prostitution cater to customers of a specific race or ethnicity, in this case, Hispanic women and Hispanic customers. One nonprofit anti-trafficking group labels them Latino Residential Brothels, or LRBs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>An underground growth industry</strong> </p>
<p>The Latino brothels rely on what amounts to slavery. Women and, in some cases, girls held captive, denied choice, denied freedom of movement, denied dignity, their bodies sold by someone else for sex.</p>
<p>Interviews with law enforcement and advocacy groups and independent research has found that Latino residential brothels have spread to at least 25 states and Washington, D.C. over the past 20 years.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p><strong>A prostitution playbook </strong></p>
<p>The brothels have developed a series of standard operating practices, experts say. Among them:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>â€¢	Most advertise, sometimes in the classifieds of Spanish-language newspapers, or more frequently by handing out &#8220;tarjetas,&#8221; business cards with codes for brothels, on the street.  An officer from the Chicago vice squad told NBC News that his group uncovered boxes of business cards during a recent brothel raid that advertised tacos and burritos for delivery 24-hours a day.  Potential customers are screened on the telephone or at the door to make sure they are members of the targeted ethnic group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Polaris Project released a report in 2009 about Latino residential brothels, an initial attempt to connect the dots of a national trend. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>For law enforcement, a moving target </strong></p>
<p>Local authorities often make strides in their communities, only to see the problem move to the next town or state. Thomas Stack and Leeland Wiley, two police detectives from Montgomery County, Md., largely eliminated the brothels in their jurisdiction several years ago. But they are under no illusions they solved the bigger problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brothels have moved to other locations, to other jurisdictions in the surrounding Washington metropolitan area,&#8221; said Stack.  &#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen a significant decrease to the brothels in our area, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are no brothels.  You can just go across the county line and find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The origins of Latino Residential Brothels in the United States go back to at least the late 1980s when enterprising traffickers set up pop-up brothels in fields adjacent to farmland near the San Luis Rey River in California, catering to migrant workers. Farm owners eventually hired private security contractors to patrol the area, according to a 1989 story from the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a more recent case, on March 24, a federal judge in Atlanta sentenced Amador Cortes-Meza to 40 years in prison for human trafficking. He was convicted of bringing 10 women and girls, some as young as 14, into the United States from rural parts of Mexico. The victims said he and his co-conspirators told them they loved them, and promised jobs and weddings. </p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Why did he do that to women?&rsquo; </strong></p>
<p>When one victim asked to be returned to her family, she testified, he repeatedly dunked her head in a bucket of water until she felt she was drowning. Another had an iron thrown at her, slicing open her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he do that to women?&#8221; asked Angelica, (not her real name) one of Cortes-Meza&rsquo;s victims, in an interview with NBC News. &#8220;He has a mother who is a woman. We&rsquo;re human beings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cases like these expose the scope and severity of the criminal networks nationally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing law enforcement agencies, besides locating and infiltrating the closed network brothels, is getting the cooperation of the victims.  Traffickers keep women and girls under close supervision, and often take away their personal identification. If they are in the country illegally, they are told that the police will arrest them for prostitution and then deport them. Often captors threaten violent retribution to their families if they run away. One girl freed from a brothel in South Carolina in 1998, reported that she was caught escaping, locked in a closet for 15 days and then raped.</p>
<p>Since Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000, women in such brothels can be treated as victims rather than criminals.  Protections include special &#8220;T Visas&#8221; allowing victims and their families to stay in the United States, counseling, health care and job placement.</p>

		<p>We can thank every President going back to Carter (Mariel boatlift), especially Reagan (1986 &#8220;one time&#8221; amnesty), the two Bushes, especially GW, who never saw an illegal Mexican he didn&rsquo;t like (of course, they&rsquo;re not living in HIS neighborhood) for this mess.  They should all be deported.  $25 billion - the cost predicted, if there were a concerted effort - would be a strategically effective and worthwhile use of money.</p>

		<p>Annoying how this is played down.  The intent of the article is to control the reader&rsquo;s perception of the issue of prostitution and &#8220;illegal aliens&#8221;.  All of the important things are left out.  Here are the more important things left out.</p>
<p>1.  There is no difference between legal and illegal aliens.  Both come here for the same reasons.  A handful come here to work.  The lions share come here as part of a drug cartel network.  Illegals are just a little lower on the food chain.  The vast majority of all Mexicans and others coming to this country are hard core criminals&hellip;.violent, drug psychopaths or working for violent drug psychopaths.  Most are militants.  Incredible numbers of guns have been seized along with drugs.  Our media goes out of its way to cover up the fact that, along with these things are uniforms.  Criminals don&rsquo;t wear uniforms.  Soldiers do.  That is a VERY different view of what Mexicans and others coming to the US are, from the standard liberal line.  It&rsquo;s also the truth.  The liberals are lying.  Disturbingly, the latest census shows that, if they choose to, they could seize control of the entire southwestern US.  However, without the institutions of maintenance&hellip;.food, fuel and all other needful things, they could not hold it.  That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t just take it at this point.  They don&rsquo;t want to lose the benefit of whites slaving away for them.</p>
<p>2.  There are large numbers of slaves in the US&hellip;.working drug fields mostly.  Most of the prostitutes are slaves.  A significant minority of the slaves are children.  By slave, I mean someone who is kidnapped, considered property by someone else, who beats and/or kills them if they disobey.  Often whole families are enslaved.  Or part of the family (usually the children) are brought to the US to work as prostitutes while their families remain south of the border as ransom&hellip;.usually as slave labor in some Aouth American county.  This is the great shame of the US.  There are far more slaves in the US now, then when it was legal.  The average American is too busy discussing his latest non-white sports hero with his buddies to wonder where the girls in the strip club they are drinking in, all look 13 and can&rsquo;t speak English.  </p>
<p>Liberals are AWARE of this.  Everyone hooked into the government from local law enforcement to the President knows the full extent of this.  Not only do they do little to nothing about it&hellip;.they actively encourage it.  And why not&hellip;..it&rsquo;s what they have planned for the average American, if they manage to become powerful enough.  If the average American understood the truth of this, it would spark an immediate revolution.  The primary job of everyone in the media (all of whom know all about this) is keeping the average American from knowing.  That&rsquo;s the job of the guy who wrote the article.  Keeping a complete blackout, draws suspicion.  But by writing the article in this way, people cluck their tongues about &#8220;crime&#8221;, think they know something, then go back to sleep.</p>
<p>3.  Although a lot of money and power flows through the slave system, it&rsquo;s nowhere near a functional, let alone effective economic system.  In history, slaves were an economic force.  They built stuff, grew food, contributed to all those labor needed to produce.  No, it was not a good way to do things, but it was a way to do things.  Slavery in those economic systems was functional.  It added to the economic base.</p>
<p>Today, slavery isn&rsquo;t even close to being that.  Instead, it is purely a reflection of our civilizations tolerance of vice.  None of these slaves, build cars, for example, or grow food.  Despite what the liberals would have you believe, they don&rsquo;t toil away in a sweat shop, sewing sneakers for Walmart.  Sure, there are plenty of people in say, China, that do those things for cheap.  But nobody owns them.  They don&rsquo;t taste lash if they get caught taking a break on company time.  They are cheap labor but calling them slaves is exaggeration.  REAL slaves do two things, produce drugs and service degenerates sexually.  Neither of these things are legitimate economic activities.  Neither builds up a society&hellip;..instead, they destroy it, to the level its tolerated.  They produce nothing but cost a lot.</p>
<p>So where does the time, effort, wealth etc. as expressed by MONEY come from to pay for these things.  A small amount of it comes from addicts, criminals and perverts who are still functional in society.  In other words, the drug user who hasn&rsquo;t reached the point where he can&rsquo;t hold down a job anymore (it may take years but they all get to that point one day).  But that is the smaller part of it.  The lions share comes from welfare.  That&rsquo;s why welfare costs so much.  A small amount of the welfare goes to legitimate things to keep the criminal from starving to death.  But most welfare is funneled into the drug, sex slave business.  Again, our government knows all about this.  With a modicum of effort, and incredible cost savings, this could be prevented.  But, it&rsquo;s part of the plan.  Eventually, they want to funnel YOU, more likely the next generation or two (your children or your grandchildren) into that system.  If everyone knew that, what would happen, I wonder.  It&rsquo;s Azriel&rsquo;s job to keep that from happening.</p>
<p>One can only hope that one day, he stands in front of a tribunal of people who knew the full extent of what he did and why&hellip;..with lots and lots of his co-conspirators behind him, awaiting their turn at justice.</p>

Can you imagine the humiliation and permanantly crippling psychological damage that you might suffer as a potential &#8220;Juan&#8221; upon being spurned by a Mexican pimp or madame at the entrance to a &#8220;barrio brothel&#8221; because of your race, ethnicity, or national origin?  </p>

		<p>I work around a LOT of latinos.  Some of them treat their females in a very coarse and rude manner.  There&rsquo;s a couple of Mexican guys here.  The way they grab ANY latina and bear hug them, kiss them on the cheeks, grope them - it&rsquo;s downright unnerving.  I wonder where all the white and jewish liberal feminists are with all this latino machismo stuff?  It&rsquo;s my guess they won&rsquo;t touch this with a ten foot pole because &#8216;diversity is our strength.&rsquo;  Hypocrites, they are!</p>

Mexican&rsquo;s, in general, abuse women.<br>
Mexican men will even abuse white women after they have siphoned them dry morally and financially.</p>
<p>The presumption that Mexicans are family oriented fell apart a long time ago in the Southwest leaving a communication gap open between the west and the east in the 2000&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mexican prostitutes are equally vulnerable targets for torture but more vulnerable to murder. </p>
<p>As of now, most whites are lethargic to the migration of Mexican&rsquo;s in the east and face a run-around by police and local governments should whites draw a complaint.</p>

		<p>I suppose it could be argued that these brothels are proof that Mexican &#8216;temporary workers&rsquo; are not generating interest among our white females and so this is a form of necessary compensation.</p>
<p>I also know that age of consent is a little less well defined in Mexico so that I suppose being surprised at a 14 year old prostitute in America makes me anachronistic.</p>
<p>But of course the final lines are what ruins everything:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Since Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000, women in such brothels can be treated as victims rather than criminals. Protections include special &ldquo;T Visas&rdquo; allowing victims and their families to stay in the United States, counseling, health care and job placement.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Having sold themselves like cattle (do _not_ think that these men and the activity they sponsor is &#8216;unknown&rsquo; back in Mexico) these pretentious victims now get free access to U.S. compensation for their stupidity -and- the chance to bring mom and dad across!</p>
<p>Tell me, what person would sell or allow their daughter to &#8216;marry&rsquo; at 14?</p>
<p>Rather than give these young women a free ride, why not ship them back as ruined examples of what happens when you sell your body cheap and then use UAVs to drop a million leaflets identifying the known active participants in these gangs?</p>

		<p>Some years ago, I was looking online at government support for college education and came across an interesting scholarship. Women brought to the US to be prostitutes could get a free college education if they cooperated with authorities to identify those who brought them over.<br>
The free college education applied not only to them, but to their parents, husband, and children.<br>

		<p>Right, there is this whole parallel Spanish world residing next to the gringo American world amongst us and we are not even aware of it. All sorts of behavior illegal and frowned upon by the larger gringo society but quite normal and proper among the amigo and amiga. And expected and while not condoned, tolerated as within the realm of human behavior.</p>

		<p>Not a crime of Latinos, in general. A crime of these particular criminals. Who, by the way, make up much too much of the illegal immigrant population  &mdash;  you make it too easy for foreigners to commit the crime of sneaking in, and it stands to reason that lots of those who sneak in are criminals.</p>

		<p>These &ldquo;brothels&rdquo; are everywhere in the sanctuary city of Houston Texas. Every time one gets busted- we learn that the operators end up having a long history of criminal related prostitution charges yet they still end up running the same business. The last bust was amazing because it was the third time they had been raided, and somehow the property owners were insulated from the operators- even though they are all related. The DA said that there is nothing they can do to physically take away the building. The truth is- that prostitution is everywhere, however, kidnapping and forced sex slavery is a different altogether.  I&rsquo;m not even sure that &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; is the best term to describe these horror chambers and those who frequent them either.</p>

		<p>This piece of news has a number of angles of analysis connected to it, from a white nationalist point of view.</p>
<p>First of all, the AR community should probably see it as good news to a certain extent, since it obviously indicates that the 24/7, 365, enemy owned &amp; controlled mainstream media&rsquo;s relentless promotion of race mixing / white genocide which is specifically and intentionally is aimed at our white females and our daughters must not be sufficiently effective to keep the appetites of all these illegal Mestizo invaders totally satisfied.  Hence, where there is a &#8216;need&rsquo;, there arises a market and a money making opportunity for the seedy underworld of organized crime.  As distasteful as it is, this can be seen as a positive sign.  </p>
<p>Secondly,  this statement should greatly concern us all:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000, women in such brothels can be treated as victims rather than criminals. Protections include special &ldquo;T Visas&rdquo; allowing victims and their families to stay in the United States, counseling, health care and job placement.&#8221;</p>
<p>This insane piece of legislation is tailor made for exploitation by millions of third world women - and by their pimps.   All they have to do to get a ticket punched to flood into America, is to volunteer to get a job as a prostitute, turn a few tricks, and then claim victim-hood status and bingo - they&rsquo;re in the door.   And, they can also apparently import their family members, and bleed the mostly white middle class tax payers for counseling, health care, and get affirmative action priority for jobs ahead of the native born white citizens.   </p>
<p>Anyone who fails to see that this Trafficking Victims Protection Act is a guaranteed way to increase both the horrific sex slave enslavement of millions of third world women by greedy, disreputable organized crime syndicates who now have yet one more tantalizing &#8216;carrot&rsquo; to dangle in front of these women in order to lure them into their clutches, but it will obviously increase illegal immigration and result in enormous additional financial burdens to the American tax payers - who will be forced to subsidize their &#8220;counseling&#8221; and free health care of these women and probably the half dozen or so off-spring that they&rsquo;ll also have in their charge.  </p>
<p>But, then - knowing how the #1 enemy of White European people world-wide thinks, perhaps this is all part of their white genocide strategy?  </p>

<p><i>I work around a LOT of latinos. Some of them treat their females in a very coarse and rude manner.</i> </p>
<p>Comrade:</p>
<p>You and I could tell some stories, couldn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>It is common knowledge and prevailing wisdom in the mexican/saldadorean community that it is OK for men to hit women, for men drink to excess, get behind the wheel of a car and drive drunk, and it is OK for men to &#8220;introduce&#8221; girls as young as 13 to sex.  There is an unprintable term for this, which I won&rsquo;t repeat here, as this is a family-friendly forum.</p>
<p>When hispanic girls get pregnant at 14, 15 or (at the late age) of 16 they are often sent to live with the male&rsquo;s family who are happy to use the girls as virtual slaves   &mdash;   to keep the young male happy and to help with housework, babysitting and cooking.  The girl&rsquo;s family agrees to this as well   &mdash;   one less mouth to feed. Once the baby is born, they want the girl OUT, but want custody of the little anchor to bring more of their family members over, make it easier to get welfare services or to &#8220;fix their papers.&#8221;  A US-born baby is a sure prized being.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s family encourages them to stay with these usually abusive young males because in their community,&#8221;everyone knows&#8221; that men hit women, drink to excess, it&rsquo;s part of life so get used to it.</p>
<p>The weary cops tell us there is so much of it going on that they rarely arrest the males unless there is a huge age difference, as in a 15-year old with a 30-year old (and this is not uncommon).  And even then, the jails in California are so full, that this (statutory rape, the age of consent in California is 18) is considered a low priority.  Plus if the male is working, putting him in jail accomplishes nothing except loss of his job (as one judge recently told one of my students).</p>
<p>This is our new reality.</p>
<p>A school nurse told me recently:  Assume all of them have chlamydia and HPV, at least, usually gonorrhea and HSV as well, one layered on top of the other.  This is a huge problem as the men won&rsquo;t wear condoms so these increasingly potent STDs are passed around repeatedly and endlessly.  The doctors tell me STD drug protocol compliance is low.  It&rsquo;s no wonder that many of the strains of gonorrhea are becoming anti-biotic resistant.</p>
<p>Many of my students have female family members who have cervical cancers, in their 20s and 30s, from HVP.  The men are getting oral, rectal and throat cancers from rampant HPV.</p>
<p>Is this what I paid California State Taxes for?    YES.</p>

		<p>This is just one of hundreds of incidents yearly that point out the failure of unchecked immigration from third world countries.  The populace here is not only dumbed down on average by including these people, but criminal elements and third world pathologies abound.</p>
<p>A sane immigration policy would have been to consist of mostly whites only, and any non-whites considered for citizenship would have to be only those who have university degrees or special skills, and both could only be included if they might be needed.  All of them would have to speak English fluently and reject their old customs, language and traditions.</p>
<p>The existing policy is total insanity.  It has encouraged the world&rsquo;s illiterate, criminal rabble to try to get into this country by any means necessary, and their presence has given leftist dregs here more political power in their quest to destroy the West via their intent or stupidity.</p>

		<p>Imagine what would happen if a virulent pathogen was to be introduced into and through these &#8216;barrio brothels&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be an STD.  Dengue Fever, Typhus, Plague, Yellow Fever, Cholera.  And a thousand other diseases that originate in South/Central America could all be coming in, illicitly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not -just- that the moral aspect of this should horrify us.  It&rsquo;s that, by acting to make these &#8216;industries&rsquo; and their specialist labor a covert presence in our society, they are creating a Typhoid Mary The Prostitute condition whereby nominally &#8216;safe&rsquo; populations with little inherent immune response to diseases of tropical America suddenly become co-victims of an unrelated sexual crime through the simple act of shopping at a common grocery store with an infected woman, her pimp or a client.</p>
<p>And these people _will not_ seek early medical care to limit the exposure group, forcing the epidemological consequences across a potentially HUGE population.</p>
<p>I do not believe that this is common in Mexico.  It can&rsquo;t be or they would be dropping like flies and have AIDS rates similar to Africa.</p>

		<p>Am I the only one who, when he reaches back in his memories of say 20 years ago, finds that the America that once was is no more?</p>
<p>Really - think about it.  For those of us raised in the 70&rsquo;s, 80&rsquo;s and even into the early 90&rsquo;s, America was generally safe, clean and you could go just about anywhere without fear (outside of a few, ahem, urban areas).</p>
<p>Now in just the last 10-15 years I find that my nation is overrun with non-whites EVERYWHERE, even in my small hometown that was 100% white just ten years ago (and is now 20% non-white).  I&rsquo;ve since moved to a major urban area and am shocked at what I&rsquo;ve found.</p>
<p>Now I have to think about it before I go to places that I had taken for granted as open in the past.  Most of the city is closed to me: enter at your own risk!  This is progress?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had this fantasy vacation of going into Minnesota and canoeing the lakes - now Minnesota is overrun with Hmong villagers and Somali tribemen.  How did that happen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go hiking in the Smokey Mountains, now I&rsquo;m afraid of running into mexican pot growers with AK-47s.  (Forget about visiting California and its wild lands!)  I&rsquo;ll never go back to New Mexico, Texas or South Florida either.</p>
<p>When I go out of my house, I see one white face in a thousand.  I live in the tower of Babel.  Neighbors don&rsquo;t talk to each other unless they&rsquo;re from the same ethnic immigrant background.  No one trusts each other around here.  (Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos, Indians, Bengalis, Arabs, Dominicans, Armenians, Jews, swarthy eastern europeans - they&rsquo;re all here on my block and none of them have anything to do with each other beyond an occassional nod.)  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t let me kids play outside freely because there&rsquo;s always some shifty ghetto thugs walking by, even though none of them live around here.  Same for the slow moving cars and vans with tinted windows that patrol the streets from time to time, casing the houses and seeking children to snatch.</p>
<p>How did we lose this nation of ours?  I&rsquo;ve never been a liberal.  No one I grew up around would qualify as a &#8216;social justice&rsquo; communist.  What happened?</p>

<p>Jay, you may not like it much, but this is what some groups have dreamed of and worked to achieve, over  many years time. Congressman Emmanuel Celler, starting in the 1920s, worked on his project <i>for forty years (!) </i> to get the immigration restrictions removed, and his open immigration bill finally passed (1965). It was his lifelong obsession.  He won.  There was also the communist  Vito Marcantonio importing planeloads of Puerto Rican peasants into New York in the 1940s/1950s.  Look him up.  They&rsquo;re just some examples.</p>
<p>Although you may not like what you see, this is the cosmopolitan Nirvana that some people  (e.g. Tim Weiss) have dreamed of and worked for all their lives. It makes them feel safer to eradicate the hated, distrusted white majority.  It is their dream come true. For the rest of us, it is a nightmare. And it&rsquo;s due to get worse.</p>

Even if they were fired for telling the truth, they can still live well for the rest of their lives.  Yes, McCain, Graham, Gingrich, Bush love these people.  Gingrich spends so much time pandering to them.  He would never stop immigration or reduce their goodies so they might as well vote for him.  Obama or Gingrich&hellip;they win either way.   </p>

		<p>For those of you who might think my &#8220;slavery&#8221; post is a bit over the top, today&rsquo;s news has a fine example of what happens to slaves if they become even the least bit inconvenient for their owners.  Note the bald faced lies, claiming these were &#8220;drug traffickers&#8221;.  They may have worked in the drug industry but not as the people with the guns.  What possible motivation would a competing drug dealer have for cleaning up after himself after shooting someone from another gang?</p>
<p>No, these were people who were probably used to being locked in cages when they weren&rsquo;t working.  Maybe they got too old or sick to work anymore.  How dare this reporter imply they were casualties in some sort of &#8220;drug war&#8221;.  These were victims of heinous crimes.  Crimes against humanity.  The motive for those crimes was greed for the American welfare dollar supplied by non-whites and the ignorant whites who think the consequences of handouts end at high taxes for working people.</p>
<p>https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/lt_drug_war_mexico</p>
<p>It has to end.  And the only way it will end is by dismantling the welfare state.  It&rsquo;s not hard.  Something as simple as a monthly drug test could easily separate out the needy poor from the criminals.</p>
<p>Of course, that assumes government, media, courts and especially politically active liberals don&rsquo;t do this on purpose.  The evidence is overwhelming that they know everything and cheer it on.  Liberals aren&rsquo;t misguided, well intentioned air heads.    The only thing that limits them is they are still frightened of what would happen if the rest of us noticed what they are doing.</p>
<p>And that is probably the most damning indictment of all.  Most of us are not liberals and (I would like to think) would not cooperate with this, if they knew.  We have a controlled media (which begs the question, who controls it).  But enough of the truth gets through that anyone who had a mind to, could know.</p>
<p>But most would rather crack open another beer and cheer on the latest group of no-talent non-whites playing some game the TV tells us is entertaining.</p>

<p>   Yes, there are real cultural differences and the controlled media, political social engineers, and academic feminists ignore this part of Machismo Mexican culture. Their assumption is that we will change them rather than the opposite. We can already see that the United States is becoming more like a Latin American country every day.  Harassment of women will only fester and increase as more single male Mexican immigrants arrive. Of course, the &ldquo;White Male Patriarchy&rdquo; is the only official oppressor of women these days.  </p>

<p> Crime is one thing but Jay is right that the quality of life has declined under relentless Third World immigration. We have become a nation of strangers with no community unity or civic pride. Only collective greed is keeping the country together and that will lose its attraction in the coming financial turmoil due to our massive debt.  </p>

<p> I really do not care about these so-called victims because many &#8220;hispanic&#8221; women start having sex at a young age (their own family condones it) and many have babies by different men, so I guess they they aren&rsquo;t too concerned about sexual matters in the first place, are they?</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too completely  confident about that, Mr. Englemann. Be skeptical of everything you read. Statistics can be &#8220;managed&#8221; and they depend on who is preparing them, as well as how.  Among other things, I was for a time in a position to supervise the preparation of crime  stats, so I do know something about the matter.  Basically, they have to please the politicians and brass, or they&rsquo;re re-done  until they look right. Careers depend on this.</p>
<p>Since the Giuliani era, politicians and police brass have gotten more sophisticated at &#8220;managing&#8221; statistics. Much of it is a matter of appearance, though not necessarily lying. Sometimes the reality doesn&rsquo;t change, but only the appearance changes.</p>
<p>Take everything with a grain of salt,  and rely on your own eyes and ears rather than what you&rsquo;re told.</p>

		<p>Regarding crime rates, it was once said that &#8220;there are, lies, damned lies, and statistics&#8221;. Regarding common sense, another said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&rdquo;. Crime is definitely getting worse with each passing decade, but the massive media censorship has brainwashed most people. Last week, my friend was beaten unmercifully by 3 Hispanic juveniles as he sat on his driveway smoking a cigarette at 10:30 PM in a middle class neighborhood in Houston Texas. The only reason he lived is because three Houston police officers arrived on the scene in progress- because the miscreants had committed a string of crimes that night and the police had a good idea which direction they were heading. One got away, but they know who he is. No mention of the unprovoked attack of a most docile and peaceful man in the media. Of course, if the races were reversed, then out come our local news cameras and our local racist race baiter- &ldquo;Quanell X&rdquo; who I like to refer to as Queenell. </p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too completely confident about that, Mr. Englemann. Be skeptical of everything you read. Statistics can be &ldquo;managed&rdquo; and they depend on who is preparing them, as well as how. Among other things, I was for a time in a position to supervise the preparation of crime stats, so I do know something about the matter. Basically, they have to please the politicians and brass, or they&rsquo;re re-done until they look right. Careers depend on this.</p>
<p>Since the Giuliani era, politicians and police brass have gotten more sophisticated at &ldquo;managing&rdquo; statistics. Much of it is a matter of appearance, though not necessarily lying. Sometimes the reality doesn&rsquo;t change, but only the appearance changes.</p>
<p>Take everything with a grain of salt, and rely on your own eyes and ears rather than what you&rsquo;re told.<br>

<p>You are 100% correct, Been There&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>I have seen over and again where &#8220;stats&#8221; are used to pull the wool over the White sheeple&rsquo;s eyes. Make them think what their enemy wants them to think.</p>
<p>I read many White forums over the years and it is plain to see who is a troll and who isn&rsquo;t. We are all aware of the &#8220;government,SPLC trolls&#8221; by now, aren&rsquo;t we? </p>
<p> Most of Mr. Englemann&rsquo;s posts are 99% &#8220;showing how Whites are just as bad&#8221; and his transparency is easy to detect, even for a beginner. The next question is of course, is John even White? <br>

		<p>When statistics don&rsquo;t square with common sense, question the statistics.  For example, we&rsquo;ve been hearing for years that there are ten million illegals in the U.S., as if more were not coming in every year.  They lie, that&rsquo;s all.<br>
     So when we get hordes of Mexicans pouring in, and someone says the crime rates are decreasing, don&rsquo;t believe them.  Unless we&rsquo;re stuffing them in prisons faster than they enter the country, crime will increase.  </p>
