<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world/20110331/EU.France.Islam/">Ex-Sarkozy Aide Lashes Out at Debate on Islam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Camille Rustici, Comcast News, March 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s ousted adviser on diversity called the president&rsquo;s conservative party the &#8220;plague of Muslims&#8221; amid a growing furor over its plans to debate Islam&rsquo;s role in France.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sarkozy fired his diversity adviser Abderrahmane Dahmane last month after Dahmane criticized the debate.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday, Dahmane told The Associated Press that he wants to rally Muslims against the UMP and its leader, Jean-Francois Cope, in charge of the debate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to engage the whole (Muslim) community against Jean-Francois Cope and against his party. Cope&rsquo;s UMP is the plague of Muslims,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dahmane is a controversial figure of Algerian descent who has called on French Muslims to wear a green star Tuesday in a sign of protest, similar to the yellow star that Jews were forced to wear under Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking about Islam in France is not taboo,&#8221; Dahmane said. &#8220;We have to debate but we do not have to discriminate,&#8221; he said, adding he is in favor of a debate in a multiparty commission at the Parliament.</p>
<p>Dahmane said the debate only serves one goal: to enable Sarkozy to win the 2012 presidential elections by gaining far-right votes. The anti-immigrant National Front party performed well in local elections Sunday.</p>
<p>The debate comes days before a new law comes into effect banning the face-covering Islamic veil, which Sarkozy says makes women &#8220;prisoners.&#8221; A 2004 law bans Islamic headscarves and other ostentatious religious symbols from public schools. Traditionally Catholic France formally separated church and state with a 1905 law.<br/>

<p>You just answered your own Question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dahmane is a controversial figure of Algerian descent who has called on French Muslims to wear a green star Tuesday in a sign of protest, similar to the yellow star that Jews were forced to wear under Nazi occupation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good strategic move.  Make your enemies look like Nazis and yourselves look like helpless Jews.  Liberals will be swooning and dying to help you, no matter how you act.</p>

		<p>This is a dog and pony show designed to trick voters before the election into thinking that Sarkozy is against white dispossession.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the French public will not be fooled and will vote for Marine LePen.  </p>

		<p>The French are about to break one of the golden rules&hellip;(thou shalt not OUTRAGE muslims or blacks) VIOLENCE is gonna be the result with the usual auto burnings, robberies, murders, rapes of White women and property destruction, praying in the street and blocking said streets and DARING the police to do anything about it (muslims do not pray in the streets of Saudi or any muslim country I have been in) &hellip;Religion of peace at it again.</p>

		<p>Muslims in position of power in France have recently taken to a nasty habit of lashing out at the natives in a really outrageous and insulting manner, at the slightest sign of reluctance to let Islam have its ways.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really telling is that those Muslims have usually been pampered by the system. They have reached top-level jobs that would have been off limits to them but for affirmative action.</p>
<p>What this article does not report is that Abderrahmane Dahmane complained about this alleged French islamophobia to the Algerian government. He told the media that Algeria supported financially a great many mosques in France (most notably the Great Paris Mosque, established in the 1920&rsquo;s), thus implying that the Algerian government had a handle on Islam-related policies in France, and that it should use it.</p>
<p>Please note that this, ahem, gentleman is supposed to be a French national, and that apart from being a former advisor to the French president, he holds a high-level job in the French department of Education (general inspector of education).</p>
<p>How do you call such a guy ? I call him a traitor. That&rsquo;s the correct, technical word for what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also, how shall I say ? not exceedingly clever, to say the least. Insulting the majority of Frenchmen who voted for Sarkozy, and siding with Algeria against France, is exactly what might incite even more people to vote for the far-right, anti-immigration, anti-islam Front national.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always some point at which Muslims&rsquo; arrogance will trump their rational thinking.</p>

<p>Dear God&hellip;how can anyone in their right mind believe France is better off having admitted these lunatics to their country. I wonder if France believes diversity is their greatest strength? </p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>The problem in France is that (there, just as here) there are <i>certain people and groups </i>who DO believe in diversity, and who are determined to push it forward  at all costs&rsquo; because it serves their own narrow, particularist interests. </p>
<p>It may not be &#8220;good for the French&#8221;,  but it is perceived as good for some,  And that&rsquo;s the crux..</p>
<p>If you were an African, wouldn&rsquo;t you favor African immigration? If you were a Moslem, wouldn&rsquo;t you favor Moslem immigration?<br/>
If you were an aggressive  minority and wished to weaken the majority, wouldn&rsquo;t you be in favor of more minority immigration?  Some of these minority groups are very influential. The true French are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And that is why we have this problem. You figure it from there.<br/>

		<p>The purpose of universalism and multiculturalism is to create pluralities.  Not to merge cultures into unified wholes.</p>
<p>Pluralities divided along ethnic lines are -not supposed- to be crossed over.  They -are supposed- to be divisive.</p>
<p>So that, in having one majority-minority embattled with another, of just slightly lesser standing, you can disempower the national ideal of &#8216;one land, one people&rsquo;, altogether.</p>
<p>We all know who invented the tactic of divide et empora as a defeat in detail movement but it is the &#8216;with a twist&rsquo; element of putting peoples against each other in lands which, by rights, one side should not be present at all, that is so maddening.</p>
<p>Because it is all based on the Nazis-killed-Jews and Whites-enslave-Ethnies illusional perception that if we defend our own as OURS TO OWN, we are racist.</p>
<p>When one need only look as far as Saudi Arabia to see that even were this arbitrary designation true, it is not being applied &#8216;universally&rsquo;, at all.</p>
<p>This is the true sign of evil in this.  That only The West is under this kind of attack.</p>

		<p>Abderrahmane Dahmane has just gone a step further. He had already called president Sarkozy&rsquo;s party, the UMP, &#8220;the plague of Muslims&#8221; (this is much stronger language in French than in English). </p>
<p>He has just added that the UMP are &#8220;fascists&#8221;. By all reasonable standards, the UMP is a center-right party, or even a center-left one from an American conservative perspective.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that Abderrahmane Dahmane is currently a senior civil servant within the French administration. He took care to mention it, during the same interview where he called the UMP &#8220;fascists&#8221; and &#8220;the plague of Muslims&#8221;.</p>
