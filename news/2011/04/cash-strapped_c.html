			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ryan Kisiel, Daily Mail (London), April 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For those who were caught up in the violence and destruction, the Brixton riots are best forgotten.</p>
<p>Yet Labour councillors are spending thousands of pounds remembering tomorrow&rsquo;s 30th anniversary of the carnage in South London which put 279 police officers in hospital.</p>
<p>The incident has been renamed the &#8216;Brixton Uprising&rsquo; and will feature &#8216;first-hand witness accounts&rsquo; along with &#8216;special guests&rsquo; to provide the entertainment.</p>
<p>Lambeth Council is staging the celebration in its Windrush Square and Tate Library. It will be recorded for the council&rsquo;s Black Cultural Archive.</p>
<p>The Jamaican &#8216;dub poet&rsquo; Linton Kwesi Johnson, whose work contains graphic descriptions of alleged police brutality during the 1980s, including one entitled &#8216;Ingland is a Bich&rsquo;, is due to perform.</p>
<p>The Labour-run authority is funding the event despite constant complaints by its leader, Steve Reed, that government-imposed cash cuts would lead to a rise in crime and another &#8216;Baby P tragedy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Lambeth has recently declared mass redundancies among street cleaners, park rangers and lollipop ladies, and closed all but one of its public lavatories.</p>
<p>A spokesman said tomorrow&rsquo;s event was &#8216;community-led&rsquo; and part of its work engaging with the public.</p>
<p>But Conservative MP Patrick Mercer, chairman of the Commons sub-committee on counter-terrorism, said: &#8216;I would question the act of celebrating an insurgency.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was difficult and dangerous at the time and I don&rsquo;t want to remember it.</p>
<p>&#8216;The law is the law and, just because it was chaotic 30 years ago, there is no need for celebrations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: &#8216;This is crazy and a complete waste of public money.</p>
<p>&#8216;Calling it an uprising justifies and celebrates that people were injured and property was damaged.</p>
<p>&#8216;Anybody who celebrates violence is despicable. The public purse is being pulled tight and it is not right to celebrate violence, especially in the current climate when there has been a recent return to violent protest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More than 5,000 rioters rampaged through Brixton in 1981 after police increased stop-and-searches in the area.</p>
<p>A total of 28 shops were burned, 118 were looted and 120 cars were set on fire as police fought running battles with the rioters in the streets. Socialist and left-wing groups first referred to it as an &#8216;uprising&rsquo; to give it an air of legitimacy, arguing that it was a poor social underclass who revolted against their captalist masters.</p>
<p>But the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said: &#8216;Nothing, but nothing, justifies what happened.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I have no corroboration, this is just a guess on my part.  But I bet the &#8220;SUS&#8221; laws used for these searches were laws that black politicians and civil rights leaders wanted, asked for loudly and got, precisely because &#8220;gun or drug violence was afflicting black communities especially hard.&#8221;  Not too dissimilar from the way American black pols and civil rights groups wanted crack cocaine punished far more harshly than power cocaine in the 1980s, then ten years later started complaining about the &#8220;racism&#8221; of crack-power disparities in punishment.</p>

		<p>All I know about the Brixton Riots is the Clash song (which, of course, glorified the riots).</p>
<p>Was it the usual case of blacks killing and attacking whites?</p>

<p>You can bet that none of the &#8216;first-hand witnesses&rsquo; are going to be even one of the 279 police who were sent to hospital.</p>
<p>If we could put a fence around these people, I wouldn&rsquo;t care what they celebrate. Unfortunately, they have no intention of staying in the hell-holes they create. </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the Detroit Race &#8220;Uprisings&#8221;, along with the Watts &#8220;Uprisings&#8221;  and the LA &#8220;Uprisings&#8221;.</p>
<p>How dumb does that sound?</p>
<p>I suppose when white people do this in the future it will be back to &#8220;riots&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course when white people do it in the future, hypothetically, it will be Hitler 2 and the resurgence of Nazism in the eyes of the unbiased media.  Never will it be called a cry for help or people fed up with being oppressed.  White people cannot even be oppressed, like they are not covered in the U.S. Civil Rights.  Well, white men that are straight and not jewish or muslim, anyways.</p>

		<p>So there you have it.<br>
Representatives of the Labour Party wish to celebrate and praise the worst civil insurgency in modern British history - an orgy of violence, theft and robbery, in which the officers of the peace in Britain (the Metropoltan Police), were physically attacked.Next they&rsquo;ll be singing the praises of Winston Silcott, who was accused of hacking to death PC Keith Blakelock in Tottenham in 1985.PC Blakelock was attacked by blacks armed with machetes, his head was left hanging by a sinew to his body.<br>
  The Labour Party are not only insane, anti-worker, capiatlist loving open borders enthusiasts, they are stinking traitors and desecrators of Britishness to boot.</p>

		<p>For the very life of me I am unable to understand why any white person in Britain votes for the Labour party? They should be called the treason party.</p>

		<p>I would trade places with any non-White immigrants just to be in Briton I am afraid it is too late to save the American Colonies, particularly when the motherland is being infected with the same plague.<br>

		<p>Changing the perception, my guess is we in the uk and Europe are being steered towards a new cultural revolution, one from which it will be engineered that we do not survive.<br>
They have now glorified a Riot into an uprising, I think that tells us what the agenda is, the liberal elites are telling the minorities it is ok to rise up against whitey.<br>
Watch out for more suggestions like this from our traitorous politicians.</p>
