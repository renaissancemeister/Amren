<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A first-grade teacher in Paterson, N.J., was suspended on Thursday after she posted on her Facebook page that she felt like a warden overseeing future criminals, district officials said.</p>
<p>The teacher, who has not been publicly identified, was suspended with pay from her position at School 21 after parents complained to the school and asked that their children be removed from her class, district officials told The Record of North Jersey.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a similar episode, a high school English teacher in Doylestown, Pa., was suspended recently after she called students &#8220;disengaged, lazy whiners&#8221; on her blog.</p>

		<p>Instead of these parents investigating the truth or falsity of the statement and why it was made, they demand removal of the teacher.  They should in reality demand the removal of the students who steal the education from those wanting to learn and take the school district to task for allowing such an environment to exist.</p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t ALL teachers wardens of future criminals in the cesspool called America, today?  Just read the racial stats of that school and tell me the teacher is not right. Soon there will be no WHITE teachers, policemen, judges, etc. in this third world cesspool. Then what, White folks?</p>

		<p>Since I don&rsquo;t &#8216;tweet&rsquo; or use FB or any of the other social EML systems, I can only guess whether your identity is protected in using these sites but it does strike me as odd that, out of all the teachers and students in this failed educational district, they somehow managed to so quickly identify the speaker and the class to which she referred.</p>
<p>I did not know half my teacher&rsquo;s first names, let alone their personal beliefs about me as a student and upon being told that they were unpleased with their having to teach my class, my parents&rsquo; response would would likely been one of: &#8220;Yeah, so, we have something in common I don&rsquo;t like raising the little brat half the time&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course with parents like mine, I didn&rsquo;t exactly go around looking to borrow trouble either&hellip;</p>
<p>Short of naming names, the NYU professor&rsquo;s hypocritical analogy to doctors thus also seems out of place.</p>
<p>Young kids can be little monsters and because modern elementary education is little more than institutionalized daycare, there is no way to weed out the worst of them.  By the time they hit college, they are paying for the privilege and you can dismiss them if they become disruptive in class, no problem.</p>

****************<br/>
Look at the &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; stats of the school. The parents of the 3 or 4 students in the entire school who really DO want to learn should remove them and let the poor teacher get on with her &#8220;herding&#8221;. In fact, give her combat pay. What&rsquo;s the beef here anyway? Her students (and their parents, likely) probably can&rsquo;t read a blog anyway, and their parents were most likely told to be &#8220;offended&#8221; by someone who has a axe to grind with this teacher or the fact that she&rsquo;s (probably) white.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>So true. When I tutored at an inner city black afterschool program (a catholic school no less) I noticed just how different their behavior is from white 1st and 2nd graders. None of the students could be taught, not that they made much of an effort, but would dillegently look for opportunities to get free homework answers from you or their classmates. Teaching them math was like pulling teeth; they could not follow you when you were telling them how to do a problem. You could explain something to them twenty times and they wouldn&rsquo;t make even the slightest bit of improvement. They wouldn&rsquo;t even put pen to the paper. I assume the dumber white students would at least try. This wasn&rsquo;t a special program for &#8220;troubled youths&#8221; mind you, this was just a place to keep them until their parents picked them up.<br/>
What was the most disconcerting though, was the casual attitude with which they regarded violence. Many of them claimed to have brothers in prison. They were prone to hitting each other and I mean HIT, as in clenching their fist and punching as hard as they could. If they didn&rsquo;t like something a classmate did, they would simply say &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to shoot you&#8221;. Nobody cared though, certainly not their fatassed teachers who sat down chatting with each other all afternoon.</p>

		<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes example is the most accurate analogy there is for the education industry and public schools.  The ONLY measure of success for &#8216;reforms&rsquo; in the schools is the degree of implementation.  It does not matter if the approach has no evidence of improving student performance, and especially if there is evidence that the &#8216;reform&rsquo; has proven ineffective, teachers are vilified for questioning or objecting to any hair brained &#8216;reform&rsquo;.  These reforms are often massive restructuring projects that entail huge costs, have no evidence whatsoever of effectiveness, and take years to implement.  In Los Angeles, the latest of these fiascos is called &#8216;Small Learning Communities&rsquo;.  The true believers who ramrod these &#8216;reforms&rsquo; down teachers&rsquo; throats are provided with extra conference periods, extra pay, or leave the classroom altogether to focus full time on implementing the reform nightmare.  International Baccalaureate is another one rearing its ugly head to huge leftist fanfare.<br/>
