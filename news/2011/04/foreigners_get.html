<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=284345">Foreigners Get College Paid by U.S. Taxpayers</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen G. Peacock, WorldNetDaily, April 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of African students whose college tuitions are being paid by the U.S. government yesterday received a boost of additional funds to continue their educations  &mdash;  and an executive from the private contractor coordinating the program just happens to be the wife of a senior Obama administration official, WND has learned.</p>
<p>According to a document uncovered by officials with T-RAM, the U.S. Trade &amp; Aid Monitor blog, during a routine search of a federal contracting database, the U.S. Agency for International Development under the current initiative has already spent nearly $2.1 million to send 16 students from the southeast African nation of Malawi to colleges in their homeland as well as in the U.S. and Kenya.</p>
<p>Because the final &#8220;task order&#8221; of the contract is set to expire in May  &mdash;  and since USAID says it is not finished fully training the Malawian students  &mdash;  the agency has granted a $650,000 &#8220;bridge&#8221; contract to the Vermont-based organization World Learning.</p>
<p>The single-source, one-year award will enable the students to complete their degree programs, prevent damage to the reputation of the U.S. and will help USAID to avoid tens of thousands of dollars in expenses stemming from additional airfare and other logistical costs, USAID says.</p>
<p>World Learning&rsquo;s senior vice president for international development and exchange programs is Carol Jenkins. {snip}</p>
<p>Jenkins is the wife of Robert Jenkins, director of the USAID Office of Transition Initiatives within the agency&rsquo;s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The single-source contract is justified, USAID asserts, because the cost of transporting the students and their belonging back to Malawi  &mdash;  and back again to the U.S. once it issues a separate solicitation and a subsequent contract order  &mdash;  would compound an already heavy investment into the program.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;For Kenyan [college] participants, the U.S. government pays the graduate program tuition of $3,261 per semester and room and board of approximately $1,575 per semester,&#8221; the document continues. &#8220;Participants also receive a stipend of approximately $441 per month as a maintenance allowance and $525 for health insurance. In Malawi, the U.S. government pays the tuition of $1,675 per term plus an additional $945 for room and board. Participants also receive a maintenance allowance of $300 per month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Separately, USAID last year sought to hire a privately contracted education adviser to deploy to Malawi. USAID created that position, which comes with an $85,000-$110,000 annual salary range, to help the government of Malawi address a number of chronic problems facing its public education system.</p>

<p>Aww, isn&rsquo;t that nice?  Meanwhile, the U.S. budget deficit for the most recent fiscal year is bigger than the entire Federal budget in FY 2001.</p>
<p>I have contended for a long time that the Federal government&rsquo;s welfare budget is a lot bigger than it seems just looking at the official stats.  This aid package for Malawian students to attend college on the U.S. and Kenya (there&rsquo;s Kenya again   &mdash;   This White House seems to be very interested in Kenya for some odd reason), is under USAID, which is under the State Department.  Therefore, this welfare goody is hidden in the foreign relations budget.  A lot of what seems to be education, health care and military spending are also really disguised de facto welfare spending.</p>

		<p>I agree.  The welfare figures have got to be much higher.  The media tries to keep programs like this under wraps. These people get cash and free medical too!  And if the women have children we have new citizens.  They&rsquo;ll never leave.  Think about it, not only do illegal aliens give birth to citizens but visitors (lots of fraud there), students, legal workers.  My sister and her husband pay almost $1,000 a month for medical insurance.  These people get it for free.  They will pay tens of thousands for college for my niece and nephew.  These people get it for free.  Insanity.  </p>

		<p>The pyramid scheme known as global finance needs more global trade to pick up the pace of spending, just to ease the debt payments.</p>
<p>Schemes to train a cadre of educated Third World leaders are a sign the elites are grasping at any straw to salvage 50 years of failed development work in Africa. In poverty, they can&rsquo;t afford globally traded commodities.  </p>
<p>The &#8216;Marshall Plan&rsquo; for post-colonial Africa has failed.  Time to stop throwing good money after bad.</p>

		<p>If you are a college student and USA citizen, think about this for a moment.  Is it right that you have to pay so much to attend a USA college while our government pays for foreigners to attend college?  The worst part is that your taxes and your parents taxes pay for this insanity.</p>
<p>So, not only do you have to pay to attend a USA college, but meanwhile, you are taxed to make sure that Africans can attend your same college for free.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this picture?</p>

		<p>   This has been going on for decades. Our government does indeed pay for Third World students to study here in America. They are supposed to go back to their own countries educated with a good opinion of America. Normally, their opinion of America, economically that is, is so good that they never leave.</p>

		<p>This is an outrage! Americans don&rsquo;t even want to pay for other Americans college tuitions. And by that I mean whites. <br>
Those that espouse we should aid others yet forsake our own are truly a despicable lot. Smugness wrapped in clothes of kindness. Sorta like a selective Scrooge snubbing the local poor yet donating time and money to nonwhites even those an ocean and continent away. </p>

		<p><i>The single-source contract is justified, USAID</i></p>
<p>There is <b>no justification for this program.</b></p>
<p>Meanwhile here&rsquo;s the latest news for parents of White UC students, children of productive Californians whose taxes support the UCs, those who are ineligible for scholarships and grants due to the color of their skin:</p>
<p><i>Governor Brown warned in a speech Wednesday that University of California tuition would double to more than $20,000 a year if no new revenue is raised, the Associated Press reported.</i></p>
<p>Revenue from where governor?  We California taxpayers, <i>the ones that haven&rsquo;t fled the state that is</i>, are completely tapped out because we have to support ourselves AND all the dirt poor illegal aliens the likes of YOU welcome into the state.</p>
<p><i>I have direct knowledge of how many, many illegal Latinos get free scholarships galore. Colleges are literally falling all over themselves to throw money at them.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Jay</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s very depressing this time of year as illegal and legal Latino students who read and compute at a sixth or seventh grade level and scored in the 300s on the SATs are offered full rides to the CSUs and UCs. </p>
<p>Makes me want to chew nails.  </p>

<p>Another point to be considered here is how much of the &#8220;new revenue&#8221; will be raised from White taxpayers whose children will not receive any benefit owing to de facto affirmative action policies.</p>
<p>Well, cheer up, given White flight from California, and the general antipathy among Whites towards paying more taxes, the new revenues are not going to be raised and California will continue the downward slide. </p>
<p>But all this shows the reality of the policies which the liberal establishment has implemented over the last several decades (in collaboration with many conservatives): open borders, de facto affirmative action, high taxes, welfare state, ad nauseam. California used to be a byword for utopia. Now it has become another symbol of American decline.</p>

<p>Their impression or opinion of America and Americans is that they are superior to us and we are imbeciles willing to pay their way through life. As you said they wont go back, but they sure will bring more of their kind over here, and the boobs in the boob hatcheries will accept them with open arms.</p>

		<p>As your family tightens its belt to come up with this year&rsquo;s tax payment, at least you can be happy knowing that part of those taxes are going to help some foreigner gain an ivy league university education plus travel and living expenses.  </p>
<p>Now, ask your government to provide the same for your children   &mdash;   children who are citizens of the USA.  What do you think the answer will be?  </p>

<p>My ex-neighbours have a brand new car, get free rent, free legal, free insurance, free medical, free education. Basically anything they could want except groceries and electricity bills, which they pay for from their monthly welfare cheque.</p>
<p>I have to work and pay my taxes, or end up on the street homeless.</p>
<p>I once went over to their house because the mail had been delivered to the wrong address. I&rsquo;m a friendly person, and I tried to make some light conversation, they made it very clear they weren&rsquo;t interested in knowing me, they gave me my mail and closed the door in my face. </p>
<p>Plenty of other black people visit them every day.. none of them work, they just visit each other and watch TV and cook and eat and live life to the max.</p>
<p>And local people are homeless, sick, broke and given nothing.. except for maybe a warning if they ever say anything against our wonderful African migrants.</p>
<p>The system is beyond repair.</p>

I do surveys in Spanish. It&rsquo;s amazing how many say their household income is below $20,000/year, yet when I ask what their monthly mortgage or rental payment is they say it&rsquo;s something like $1200 or $1500.  </p>
