			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC, April 18, 20011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A nationalist party has taken nearly a fifth of votes in Finland&rsquo;s general election, the electoral commission says.</p>
<p>The True Finns finished just behind the conservative NCP and the Social Democrats on around 19%. </p>
<p>{snip} <br>
<strong><br>
&#8216;Invitation to talks&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>The anti-immigration True Finns won 39 seats in the 200-member parliament, final results showed.</p>
<p>That put it five seats behind the conservative National Coalition Party (NCP)  &mdash;  part of the current centre-right government and a strong advocate for European integration  &mdash;  and just three behind the opposition Social Democrats. </p>
<p>The Centre Party  &mdash;  previously the largest party in parliament  &mdash;  won just 35 seats, down 16 from the last election in 2007.</p>
<p>The strong showing for the True Finns meant the anti-euro party would at least &#8220;get an invitation to talks&#8221; on a new government, Reuters quoted party leader Timo Soini as saying.</p>
<p>Celebrating the NCP&rsquo;s success, Jyrki Katainen played down suggestions that Finland would now cause difficulties for the eurozone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finland has always been a responsible problem solver, not causing problems,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is about a common European cause. After the elections, the biggest parties will begin to look for common ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>EU &#8216;squanderers&rsquo; </p>
<p>Tampere University political analyst Ilkka Ruostetsaari told AFP news agency the election outcome was astonishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The True Finns&rsquo; victory, surpassing every poll and every expectation of a drop on election day &hellip;  plus the total collapse of the Centre  &mdash;  the whole thing is historic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Opinion polls had predicted a strong result for the True Finns but were giving the party around 15%, not 19%. In the 2007 election, the party had won just 4%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the same time, he sought to assure other EU states that his party posed no threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not extremists, so you can sleep safely,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Analysts attribute much of his party&rsquo;s success to disenchantment with the big three mainstream parties who have run Finland for decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a multiple protest,&#8221; journalist Timo Harakka of Finnish TV YLE told BBC World Service. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a no confidence vote for how things have been run so far. Concerning Europe for instance, or the economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems The True Finns&rsquo; just had a magical moment right now,&#8221; he said, adding that, &#8220;negotiations for the government will be really strenuous for the coming months.&#8221; </p>
<p>Some Finns expressed concern about the surge in support for the True Finns. </p>
<p>&#8220;They have strict opinions about everything,&#8221; one young woman voter, who gave her name as Eevi, told Reuters. </p>
<p>&#8220;Finnish people have always been very open, I wonder why we are now pulling off, closing up again.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Most immigration parties have a nasty record and present a rather ugly face. If leftists don&rsquo;t their &#8216;enemies&rsquo; of this kind taking power, they&rsquo;d be wise to advocate sane immigration policy themselves. Makes you wonder if it&rsquo;s really all a trick to &#8216;turn back the clock&rsquo; on all these progressive &#8216;advances&rsquo;. Being a rabid righty myself, I hope it is.  </p>

		<p>Notice this bromide:  </p>
<p><i>Analysts attribute much of his party&rsquo;s success to disenchantment with the big three mainstream parties who have run Finland for decades.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a multiple protest,&rdquo; journalist Timo Harakka of Finnish TV YLE told BBC World Service.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a no confidence vote for how things have been run so far. Concerning Europe for instance, or the economy.</i></p>
<p>I bet you&rsquo;ve heard it before.  The lame media break it out every time a nationalist/right party or politician does well in a public election.  You heard it a lot the evening and morning after Pat Buchanan won or did very well in a primary or caucus in 1992 and 1996.</p>
<p>While there is a small percentage of people who would vote for someone or something borne of pure protest, you can&rsquo;t get almost one in five votes in a national election in a first world country, nor 40% of the vote against your own party&rsquo;s incumbent President in a state&rsquo;s partisan primary (New Hampshire Republicans, 1992), nor a clear majority of caucus goers to beat a man who was already his and your party&rsquo;s nominee, having mathematically clinched the nomination several weeks ago (Missouri Caucuses, Republican, 1996   &mdash;   Yours truly was a participant), if it&rsquo;s not obvious that you&rsquo;re for something and have a vision and a clear world view.</p>
<p>Another problem with it is that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  Especially in Finland&rsquo;s sense  &mdash;  Why would liberal-ish conservatives upset with the National Coalition Party, left-wing and non-white voters upset with the Social Democrats, and airhead &ldquo;centrists&rdquo; upset with the &ldquo;Centre Party&rdquo; manifest their frustration with their &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; party of choice by voting for the hard right (by Finnish standards) party and putting it right in the numerical mix with all of them?  And why is it that only &ldquo;hard right&rdquo; parties or candidates&rsquo; support is deemed as a simple matter of &ldquo;protest?&rdquo;  Wasn&rsquo;t a vote for any Republican Presidential candidate in 1992 or 1996 a &ldquo;protest vote?&rdquo;  Isn&rsquo;t a vote for the NCP, SD or CP in Finland this past weekend a &ldquo;protest vote&rdquo; against something?</p>

<p>Eevi, come and visit any number of large American cities starting with Detroit. I&rsquo;m sure that the 2005 riots in France and a bunch of other incidents have started to galvanize certain groups in Europe. Multiculturalism has NEVER worked anywhere in the world without a Tito like ruler. Do you wish to see 9 year old girls married off to old men? Do you wish to be subjected to virginity tests at your local OB/GYN? Do you wish to live in Dhimmitude? This will be your future without direct action. </p>
<p>Also, why is it incumbent on Northern Europe to keep bailing out derelict countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finland has always been a responsible problem solver, not causing problems,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p><br>
Quite true. Which is precisely why prosperous Finland needs to have as little to do with the EU Socialist Superstate   &mdash;   and their open-borders immigration policies   &mdash;   as it possibly can. </p>
<p>Successful European nations like Finland and Germany are, for the EUrocrats, the &#8220;responsible problem solvers&#8221; who must constantly bail out the EU&rsquo;s less-responsible members like Greece and Portugal. Hardworking Germans and Finns are treated like suckers by the EU, and forced to pay for the mistakes of others. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad to hear that enough Finns agree with me to hoist the True Finns into third place. <br>

		<p>The Mongoloid Finnish language is decisive in making Finns more ethnocentric than other Westerners as well as keeping immigrants away relatively speaking compared to neighboring Sweden. Finns (and Estonians) may be the most linguistically &amp; genetically exotic and least pure Whites but I&rsquo;m glad many are opting for preservation bc their miscegenation, occuring in Antiquity, is thus less toxic to ethno-cultural cohesion than miscegenation in Modernity due to replacement by popular &#8216;culture&rsquo;</p>

		<p>One of the reasons for this landslide victory was indeed the anti immigration stance of the many &#8220;true finns&#8221; candidates. Especially towards low skilled, perhaps even illiterate, immigrants from African and middle eastern countries.</p>
<p>Skilled tax paying immigrants that can find a job in Finland are welcome, others not so much.</p>

		<p>The Finnish language is not &ldquo;Mongoloid&rdquo; nor are the Finns an Asiatic people. Finnish is a member of the Finnic group of the Uralic family of languages. The Finnic group also includes Estonian and other minority languages spoken around the Baltic Sea. The origin of the language has been traced back to the Ural Mountains in Russia. Most Finnish people would be classified as  Nordic. </p>

<p><br>
Thanks to Sardonicus for setting this straight. The uninformed post from highduke was ridiculous. (Mongoloid language!!!)</p>
<p>Finland was for many centuries the eastern half of the kingdom of Sweden, until it was taken by Russia in 1809  (precipitating Sweden&rsquo;s neutrality ever since).   Over the centuries, many Swedes had settled there (and Finns in Sweden also).   Today, Swedish is the other official language of Finland, as Finish is also the second legal language in Sweden.</p>
<p>As for non-whites and immigrants, I have been in Finland three times in the past couple of years, and I can attest that the non-white immigrant presence in Finland, while it is there, is much, much less than it is in Sweden (or Denmark or Norway).</p>
<p>The Finns, unlike the others, had to fight for their country twice within the past century (against the Russians). I mean REALLY fight. This was a real war, with very severe losses.  Unlike the others (particularly the Swedes), who&rsquo;ve had it easy, they value their identify and intend to hang on to their country.</p>
