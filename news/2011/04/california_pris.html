<h1><a href="/ar/2005/05/index.html">California Prison Segregation to End</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephen Webster, American Renaissance, May 2005</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> <span class="dropcap">O</span>n February 23, the United States 
Supreme Court issued a ruling that is likely to stamp out the last 
vestige of government-enforced racial segregation in the United States. 
In <i>Johnson v. California,</i> it ordered the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals to review the housing policies of the California prison system, 
and to apply legal standards that will probably lead it to ban the 
practice of temporarily grouping new arrivals by race and ethnicity. At 
issue was whether the California Department of Correction&rsquo;s (CDC) 
decades-old practice of giving prisoners initial cellmates of their own 
race violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The 
policy, of course, was to keep inmates from killing each other, but 
merely saving lives is less important to six Supreme Court justices than
 promoting the myth that race is not supposed to matter. </p>

        <p> <b>Prison Reality</b> </p>
        <p> The California prison system is not only the largest in the 
country but also the most racially mixed. Of 160,000 inmates, men 
account for 150,000 or 94 percent. In 2003, the system took in more than
 112,000 men. The racial mix is an almost perfect recipe for friction: 
37 percent Hispanic, 29 percent white, 29 percent black, and six percent
 Asian, American Indian, and Pacific Islander. Race- and even 
ethnic-based gang violence is the top security concern for prison 
guards. California, in the words of one official, is &#8220;ground-zero&#8221; for 
race-based prison gangs. </p>
        <p> For prisoners in most states, aside from the fact of 
incarceration itself, race is the central reality of life. For 
California prisoners, race-based gangs are often the very key to 
survival. Gangs protect members from other gangs, and are a source of 
information on friends and enemies. Gangs supply food and cigarettes, 
and arrange visits from people on the outside. Gangs dictate prison 
etiquette, and enforce it with violence. Because prison is such a 
dangerous place   &mdash;   a single misstep can provoke a beating or even death   &mdash;  
 gang members form strong bonds. </p>
        <p> There are two main Hispanic prison gangs in California: the Mexican Mafia or <i>La Eme</i>
 (from the Spanish pronunciation of the letter &#8220;m&#8221;), which is a southern
 California Hispanic gang, and Nuestra Familia, a northern California 
Hispanic gang. The northern and southern Hispanics hate each other. 
Nuestra Familia has a sub-group, Nuestra Raza, that operates in the 
high-security housing units. The main black prison gang is the Black 
Guerilla Family, although the Crips and the Bloods are also active. 
There are two major white gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood and the Nazi Low 
Riders. The Low Riders grew out of the Aryan Brotherhood in the 1980s 
and tend to be younger. The Hells Angels have a minor presence. </p>
        <p> Interestingly, the Aryan Brotherhood has a defensive 
alliance with the southern Hispanics of the Mexican Mafia against the 
northern Hispanics of Nuestra Familia and against the Black Guerilla 
Family. Apparently southern Hispanics hate their northern kinfolk even 
more than they hate white people. The Aryan Brotherhood also has 
friendly relations with the other white gangs, the Nazi Low Riders and 
the Hells Angels. </p>
        <table class="quoteleft">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th> Southern Hispanic gangs hate northern Hispanic gangs more than they hate white people. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> Gangs are inherently violent. They routinely rob other 
prisoners or force them into prostitution. Some gangs make prospective 
members kill another prisoner in order to join. This is known as &#8220;making
 your bones.&#8221; Hispanic and black gangs are notorious for mayhem but the 
Aryan Brotherhood is no stranger to violence, either. Prison authorities
 describe it as &#8220;a singularly vicious prison gang that has a hostility 
to black inmates.&#8221; Race-based gangs are such a problem in California 
that the state built a special &#8220;Supermax&#8221; prison at Pelican Bay   &mdash;   in the
 northwest corner of the state, as far from other prisons as possible   &mdash;   
to hold the worst cases. This is where the leaders live. </p>
        <p> Gangs are the only significant prisoner groupings, which means there are no real affiliations that are <i>not</i>
 race-based. Race and ethnicity are the boundaries of what amount to 
warring armies. This is why California temporarily separates new male 
inmates by race. Women are less violent, so they are never segregated. </p>
        <p> Housing prisoners is complicated. There are 32 prisons in 
the state, but only seven have what are euphemistically known as 
&#8220;reception centers&#8221; that process newcomers and transfers. There is 
segregation <i>only</i> in the reception centers, and a new convict 
never stays in a center for more than 60 days before he is assigned 
permanent quarters. These are either attached to the reception center or
 in a prison that doesn&rsquo;t have a center. Whenever a man transfers from 
one prison to another, he makes a stop of no more than 14 days in a 
center before he gets his new assignment. </p>
        <p> There is great variety in prison housing, with many men 
double- and triple-bunked in great, barracks-like rooms that hold as 
many as 225. In &#8220;reception centers,&#8221; however, prisoners get two-man 
cells, where they are evaluated to see what kind of permanent housing 
(general population, maximum security, etc.) they should get. These 
two-man, reception-center cells where men are held for brief evaluation 
are never integrated. Most men probably don&rsquo;t even know there is a 
segregation policy; they get a cellmate of the same race and think 
nothing of it. </p>
        <table class="boxcenter">

          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> What is the purpose of the evaluation? First, the 
authorities have to decide how violent a prisoner is likely to be. They 
consider his physical and mental health. They check his criminal 
history, and if he is transferring from another prison, they read his 
prison record. Low-security men   &mdash;   the most numerous   &mdash;   go to dormitories.
 Medium-security men get permanent two-man cells, and maximum-security 
threats get single cells. If a man is known to have testified against 
another prisoner, to have shot someone&rsquo;s best friend, or to have some 
other reason to hate or be hated, this affects his housing assignment. 
Convicted police officers and child molesters   &mdash;   whom all other prisoners
 despise   &mdash;   get special treatment, too. The prison system tries to be 
very thorough in its evaluations, and has a 75-man unit that does 
background checks both inside and outside the walls. </p>
        <p> The men in centers are therefore new additions to a 
population, and guards want to look them over before deciding what to do
 with them. They are probably complete strangers to each other, sharing 
living quarters that are more cramped and intimate than anything most of
 us will ever experience, and prison authorities want cellmates to get 
along. Size and physical condition are part of the calculation, since no
 one wants to put a weakling in with a gorilla. The idea is to give a 
man a cellmate he is unlikely to hate   &mdash;   someone of his own race. </p>
        <p> In many cases, officials even subdivide prisoners along 
ethnic lines. &#8220;You cannot house a Japanese inmate with a Chinese inmate.
 You cannot,&#8221; says Linda L. Schulteis, Associate Warden at California 
State Prison-Lancaster. &#8220;They will kill each other. They won&rsquo;t even tell
 you about it. They will just do it,&#8221; She says the same is true for 
Laotians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Filipinos. Likewise, a Hispanic 
from northern California cannot be put in the same cell with a Hispanic 
from southern California. &#8220;They already have a conflict before they come
 to prison,&#8221; explains prison spokesman Margot Bach, &#8220;and it&rsquo;s going to 
intensify when they come to prison.&#8221; </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> No other part of the California prison system is segregated,
 not the recreational facilities, dining halls, work areas or job 
assignments. Nor are dormitories reserved for certain races, though the 
authorities make sure they are racially balanced to reduce tension. If a
 prison is 50 percent Hispanic, 30 percent black and 20 percent white, 
dormitories should reflect those proportions. If there are just a few 
prisoners of one race in a dormitory dominated by another there is 
likely to be trouble. But even in mixed dorms, no prisoner is ever 
assigned a bunk directly over a prisoner of another race. Fights have 
broken out when this happened. </p>
        <p> What about the two-man cells for medium-risk offenders? In 
order to increase compatibility and reduce violence, the system lets 
inmates choose their own permanent cellmates. Both men sign forms saying
 they want to share a cell, and authorities grant the request unless 
there are security reasons not to. Needless to say, no one can think of a
 case in which someone asked for a roommate of another race. Miss Bach 
of the prison system says, &#8220;there is peer pressure when you get to 
prison to align with a [racial] group for protection.&#8221; Charles Hughes, a
 corrections lieutenant at the Lancaster prison is blunter: &#8220;If a black 
inmate asked for a white celly [cellmate] there is no way in hell that I
 would do that. I&rsquo;d refer them both for a mental-health evaluation.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Given the extraordinary level of racial tension in 
California prisons, guards would clearly like to segregate the entire 
system. Initial segregation, before authorities have a sense of whom 
they are dealing with, appears to be the minimum of common sense, and 
the California system stands behind it. Prisoners never willingly share a
 two-man cell with someone of another race. The system wisely refrains 
from forcing them to do so. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> What is the origin of the challenge to the practice? 
Garrison Johnson, who filed the original complaint, is a career criminal
 and former Crip, who was convicted in 1987 of murder, robbery and 
assault, and sentenced to 25 years to life. Mr. Johnson has been 
transferred five times, and at each stop along the way he got a black 
cellmate. In 1995, Mr. Garrison filed a <i>pro se</i> (meaning he 
represented himself) complaint with the Central District of California 
against the prison system, arguing that always being paired with a black
 violated his 14th Amendment rights to equal protection. After several 
years of procedural give-and-take, including appeals, in 2000 the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco instructed the district court 
to assign Mr. Johnson a lawyer and hear the case. When the district 
court upheld the segregation policy, he appealed to the Ninth Circuit, 
which, in 2003, also upheld the policy. That was when he took the case 
to the Supreme Court. </p>
        <p> Since Mr. Johnson is a violent, medium-security prisoner, he
 lives in a two-man cell. This means he gets to choose his celly   &mdash;   and 
he has always asked for a black. He says he simply could not ask for a 
white: &#8220;You can&rsquo;t cross races. That will start racial tension right 
there. So I know I can&rsquo;t go to a white guy and say, &#8216;Hey, I want to move
 with you&rsquo; because he is not going to move with me.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s reasoning for challenging the system is the 
following: Racial tension in prisons is so bad it is impossible for him 
to make friends with anyone who is not black. Blacks would turn on him 
if he tried, and non-blacks would spurn him. This, he says, puts in him 
danger whenever there is racial violence, because he does not have a 
single friend of another race to stick up for him in a riot. If, 
however, he spent 14 days with a white cellmate when he was transferred,
 he might make a bosom friend who would protect him the next time blacks
 and whites are fighting. Mr. Johnson has 25 years to life to make white
 friends. In effect, he is saying he wants the prison system to make 
friends for him. </p>

        <p> <b>The Ninth Circuit Ruling</b> </p>
        <p> Like so many court cases, <i>Johnson v. California</i> has a
 complex but interesting legal background. The equal protection clause, 
on which Mr. Johnson hung his case, has generally been interpreted to 
require that government pretend race does not exist. In <i>Shaw v. Hunt</i>
 in 1996 (which challenged the creation of two largely black North 
Carolina congressional districts), the Supreme Court wrote, &#8220;Racial 
classifications are antithetical to the Fourteenth Amendment, whose 
central purpose was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from 
official sources in the States.&#8221; The Court has established a standard of
 &#8220;strict scrutiny&#8221; when it comes to race (or religion, national origin, 
and sometimes sex), meaning a government agency must have a very 
compelling reason to take any notice of race at all. </p>
        <p> The Supreme Court did not formally end prison segregation until the 1968 case of <i>Lee v. Washington,</i>
 when it ruled that Alabama could no longer segregate cellblocks. The 
court did note that &#8220;prison authorities have the right, acting in good 
faith and in particularized circumstances, to take into account racial 
tensions in maintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons 
and jails,&#8221; but never offered guidelines for when racial classification 
was legitimate. Several lower courts have cited <i>Lee </i>to argue that
 &#8220;unsubstantiated&#8221; fears of racial violence do not justify segregation. 
These courts have usually limited racial separation to lockdowns 
following race riots or other violence. </p>
        <p> In 1987, however, the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Turner v. Safley</i>
 that prison administrators may limit constitutional rights of inmates 
if limiting those rights serves a &#8220;legitimate penological interest.&#8221; <i>Turner</i>
 had nothing to do with race   &mdash;   the question was whether prisoners could 
write letters and get married   &mdash;   but the Court held that the standard of 
&#8220;legitimate penological interest&#8221; applied to <i>all</i> constitutional 
claims, which would include equal protection. The justices wisely 
pointed out that &#8220;courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly 
urgent problems of prison administration and reform,&#8221; and that &#8220;the 
problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to
 the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.&#8221; </p>
        <p> In <i>Turner,</i> the Supreme Court established four rules 
for deciding whether a prison policy that limits inmate rights meets the
 standard of &#8220;legitimate penological interest.&#8221; The first is whether 
there is a &#8220;valid, rational connection&#8221; between the policy and the goal 
it is supposed to achieve. The second is whether there are &#8220;alternative 
means&#8221; by which prisoners can exercise the rights they lost because of 
the policy. The third is how much trouble it will make for a prison if 
inmates exercise their rights, and the fourth is whether there are any 
&#8220;ready alternatives&#8221; to the policy in question. </p>

        <p> Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s lawyers argued that segregation did not meet the <i>Turner</i>
 standard because there was no rational connection between temporary 
segregation and preventing violence. They claimed   &mdash;   amazingly   &mdash;   that 
since California prisons could not point to a single act of violence 
that had been caused by integrating two-man cells, the system&rsquo;s reasons 
for segregation were &#8220;unsubstantiated fears&#8221; of racial violence and 
therefore unconstitutional. Of course, there have been no such acts of 
violence because two-man cells are never integrated. </p>
        <p> The Ninth Circuit found a clear <i>Turner</i> standard 
connection between the segregation policy and its objective of reducing 
racial violence. It noted that one of the worst prison riots in US 
history was triggered in large part by the forced integration of cells 
(see next article). &#8220;Under Johnson&rsquo;s view,&#8221; it added, &#8220;the same violence
 would have to occur within the CDC [California Department of 
Corrections] in order to permit race to be considered as a factor in 
making initial housing decisions. We disagree &hellip;
 The CDC simply does not have to wait until inmates or guards are 
murdered specifically because race is not considered in assigning an 
inmate&rsquo;s initial cell mate; instead, <i>Turner </i>allows the 
administrators to stave off potentially dangerous policies without first
 &#8216;seeing what happens.&rsquo;&#8221; In other words, California was under no 
obligation to integrate prison cells just to see if its decades-old 
segregation policy really was preventing murder. </p>
        <p> The Ninth Circuit also refuted Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s argument that the policy of temporary segregation <i>increased</i>
 racial animosity by perpetuating racial stereotypes. It pointed out 
there was already plenty of racial tension in prisons with or without 
segregation, and that it was silly to argue that a measure designed to 
keep violence down was actually increasing it. Mixing up the races in 
cells would probably lead to more racial violence, not interracial 
friendship. The court also went to great pains to point out just how 
pervasive racial tension is in California prisons. It listed case after 
case in which racial gangs attacked each other, and noted that some 
prisons have been kept locked down for years at a stretch because race 
riots would erupt if there was the slightest contact. </p>

        </tbody></table>
        <p> At the end of this grisly recitation, the court noted dryly,
 &#8220;In short, this is hardly a case where the prison administrators are 
acting on an unsubstantiated record.&#8221; Therefore, &#8220;administrators are 
well within their discretion to attempt to rectify or to reduce further 
violence by taking reasonable measures.&#8221; </p>
        <p> The second <i>Turner</i> test is whether there are 
&#8220;alternate means&#8221; for a prisoner to exercise his rights, that is, 
whether blacks and whites have other opportunities to get acquainted 
despite the segregation policy in the reception centers. The Ninth 
Circuit found this was obviously true, since the same-race cell 
assignment never lasted more than 60 days. Mr. Johnson can meet all the 
whites he wants in the dining hall or the recreation yard. </p>
        <p> The third <i>Turner</i> standard, whether granting prisoners
 constitutional rights would make a lot of trouble for the prison 
authorities, was met by testimony from prison officials. Then-California
 prison system director Steven Cambra told the court, &#8220;If race were to 
be disregarded entirely  &hellip; there will be 
problems within the individual cells. These will be problems that the 
staff will have a difficult time controlling. I believe there will be 
fights in the cells and the problems will emanate onto the prison yards &hellip;
 [I]t would be very difficult to assist inmates if the staff were needed
 in several places at one time.&#8221; In other words, there would be fights 
in the cells, violence would spill into the rest of the prison, and the 
guards would be overwhelmed. </p>
        <p> As for the fourth <i>Turner</i> standard, whether there was a
 simple alternative to segregation, it was the responsibility of Mr. 
Johnson, as plaintiff, to offer one. His solution? Ask prisoners if they
 have ever been in a racial gang or if they don&rsquo;t like people of other 
races. The Ninth Circuit called this &#8220;disingenuous,&#8221; adding, &#8220;There is 
little chance that inmates will be forthcoming about their past violent 
episodes or criminal gang activity so as to provide an accurate and 
dependable picture of the inmate.&#8221; That, of course, is why the system 
has a staff of 75 investigators   &mdash;   prisoners lie. </p>
        <p> The Ninth Circuit therefore concluded that the 14th 
Amendment permits temporary segregation. Because of the special 
circumstances of prisons, this form of racial classification need meet 
only the looser standards of <i>Turner</i> and not the &#8220;strict scrutiny&#8221;
 standard that prevails elsewhere. Mr. Johnson did not accept this 
ruling and appealed to the US Supreme Court. </p>

        <p> <b>Before the Supreme Court</b> </p>
        <p> By this time, of course, Mr. Johnson had a hot, 
court-appointed lawyer, a prominent litigator named Bert H. Deixler with
 the nationally-known firm of Proskauer Rose. Mr. Deixler argued that 
the Ninth Circuit was wrong to apply the <i>Turner</i> standard and that
 by doing so, the lower court had &#8220;carved out a wholesale &#8216;prison 
exception&rsquo;&#8221; when it came to race. He repeatedly invoked the Supreme 
Court&rsquo;s ruling in the University of Michigan affirmative action cases, <i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter</i> (see &#8220;<a href="#cover">What the Supreme Court Did</a>,&#8221;
 AR, August 2003), pointing out that &#8220;all nine Justices were in 
agreement that strict scrutiny applies whenever the government 
classifies based on race&#8221; and arguing that this should be the standard 
everywhere and without exception. </p>
        <p> Mr. Deixler bought Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s claim that even brief 
segregation fed dangerous racial stereotypes, and proposed that the best
 way to undermine the influence of race-based gangs in prison was to 
integrate two-man cells. Justice John Paul Stevens, one of the Court&rsquo;s 
most liberal members, was especially pleased by this silly argument. </p>
        <p> Mr. Johnson found an ally in the Bush administration, which 
sent the acting solicitor general, Paul D. Clement, to argue that given 
the country&rsquo;s &#8220;pernicious history of race&#8221;   &mdash;   from which prisons are not 
exempt   &mdash;   it is vital that all racial classifications be subject to 
strict scrutiny. Otherwise, he implied, the innate racism of prison 
administrators would take over. </p>

        <p> During oral arguments, the justices seemed most concerned 
that the segregation policy applied to prisoner transfers as well as 
newcomers, wondering why they needed to be segregated when they had 
already been under prison system control, and had already been 
evaluated. The response of California senior assistant attorney general 
Frances T. Grunder was weak. She said it was often hard to get a 
prisoner&rsquo;s records transferred at the same time as the prisoner. Justice
 David Souter wondered if instead of segregating transfer prisoners, the
 system should just send the papers more quickly. Miss Grunder could 
have made a different argument: No one already in the prison system ever
 asks for a roommate of a different race, so the system should not court
 trouble by forcibly integrating two-man cells. </p>
        <p> The segregation policy also seems to have suffered because 
of its success. The justices wanted to know if there had ever been 
racial violence because people of different races were put in a 
reception cell. No, there hadn&rsquo;t, because the cells are never 
integrated. Rather than see this as proof the policy works, some 
justices seemed to think it showed the prison system&rsquo;s fears were 
exaggerated. </p>
        <p> <b>The Decision</b> </p>
        <p> In its February ruling, Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Kennedy 
and Souter joined Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor in sending the case back to the 
Ninth Circuit where the segregation policy will be subject to &#8220;strict 
scrutiny.&#8221; In her view, any consideration of race by government is 
&#8220;immediately suspect&#8221; and must clearly promote a &#8220;compelling state 
interest.&#8221; Any lower standard will fail to &#8220;ferret out invidious uses of
 race.&#8221; Justice O&rsquo;Connor also fell for Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s claim that 
segregation   &mdash;   even for as few as 14 days   &mdash;   may increase interracial 
violence by &#8220;perpetuating the notion that race matters most.&#8221; </p>

        <p> Justice John Paul Stevens issued a dissent, but only to 
insist that the housing policy was unconstitutional on 14th Amendment 
grounds and did not need any further &#8220;strict scrutiny&#8221; review. He wants 
the cells integrated right away. </p>
        <p> Chief Justice Rehnquist was sick with thyroid cancer during 
the case, and did not participate. Justice Clarence Thomas issued a real
 dissent, in which Justice Scalia joined. </p>
        <p> Justice Thomas pointed out that the case required the Court 
to choose between two conflicting lines of precedent. On the one hand, 
the Court has stated that <i>all</i> racial classifications by government must be subject to strict scrutiny. At the same time, the Court has said the <i>Turner</i> standard applies <i>every time</i> a prison policy limits a prisoner&rsquo;s constitutional rights. </p>
        <p> Which precedent should the Court choose? To Justice Thomas, 
decisions about race and violence &#8220;are better left in the first instance
 to the officials who run our nation&rsquo;s prisons.&#8221; He accused his 
colleagues of indifference to the reality of prison life, writing, &#8220;The 
majority is concerned with sparing inmates the indignity and stigma of 
racial discrimination. California is concerned with their safety and 
saving their lives.&#8221; Justice Thomas even wrote that he thought temporary
 segregation might survive &#8220;strict scrutiny.&#8221; Keeping Americans from 
killing each other is surely a &#8220;compelling state interest.&#8221; If the Ninth
 Circuit decides it is not, the California prison system will start 
mixing up the two-man cells. Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s white celly might turn out to
 be a 200-pound Skinhead who has always wanted to strangle a black man 
in his sleep. As Justice Thomas put it, somewhat more delicately, Mr. 
Johnson, &#8220;who concedes that California&rsquo;s prisons are racially violent 
places, and that he lives in fear of being attacked because of his race  &hellip; may well have won a Pyrrhic victory.&#8221; </p>

        <p> In fact, it is whites who will suffer most from forced 
integration. Blacks and Hispanics have a well-documented history of 
raping whites, especially the young and the weak. For many convicts, 
night after night of uninterrupted sodomy with a terrified white 
cellmate would be a dream come true (for a discussion of prison rape, 
see &#8220;<a href="#article1">Hard Time</a>,&#8221; AR, April 2002). </p>
        <p> Whites who have served time know how much race matters. 
Joshua Englehart is a white man who served 37 months in San Quentin on 
drug charges. He wrote in the <i>Los Angles Times</i> that prisoners 
will pay the price for this foolish decision &#8220;because the truth is that 
mixing races and ethnic groups in cells would be extremely dangerous for
 inmates.&#8221; &#8220;[P]rison is an undeniably racist place, and court rulings 
aren&rsquo;t going to stop it,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Rule No. 1: The various races 
and ethnic groups stick together.&#8221; Mr. Engelhart concluded that 
segregation &#8220;is looked on by no one   &mdash;   of any race   &mdash;   as oppressive or as a
 way of promoting racism. It is done for their own safety, and they know
 it &hellip; This ruling will strike dread in the hearts of all California inmates when they read about it.&#8221; </p>
         This Supreme Court decision is a particularly dangerous 
example of how our nation lets ideology blind it to reality. That Sandra
 O&rsquo;Connor and five other justices of the Supreme Court of the United 
States could actually think that briefly separating blacks from whites 
from Hispanics during evaluation <i>adds</i> to racial tensions in 
prison simply beggars belief. Can they really believe convicts show up 
without strong racial feelings, notice they got a same-race roommate in 
the reception center, and <i>then </i>decide the races are not supposed 
to get along? These six justices   &mdash;   who hold more power than even the 
President   &mdash;   have a completely fantasy-land view of what race means, 
either in prison or in the country at large. This is the view that 
guides them and our other rulers when they make important decisions that
 affect our very survival as a nation and a people.  <img src="/ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11" />

		<p>This actually is not all bad for Whites. Prison is so horrible for anyone but a hardcore Aryan Brotherhood serial killer that White criminals have voluntarily reduced their crime rate to avoid going to prison.</p>
<p>I have always thought that is why there are so few Whites in the California prison system.  Going straight is far preferable to the horrors of listening to blacks howling and yowling 24/7.</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a very smart person to realize that this is an outrageously stupid decision.  Justice O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s appointment to the court was one of the major mistakes President Reagan made during his tenure.  In Gratz and Grutter, a  school affirmative action case, O&rsquo;Connor wrote the majority opinion and said that the need for  diversity was so great that it trumped the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  She said we would only have to violate the Constitution for 25 years or so to accomplish AA.  AND,the  usual suspects also supported O&rsquo;Connor in the prison case and will share the blame for the carnage that will flow from this asinine decision.</p>

		<p>Over the past several decades racial segregation was tried here and there in many different prison systems.  The result?  Prisons were taking away blacks&rsquo; &#8220;civil rights&#8221; to harass the white minority prisoners.</p>
<p>It has been shown across the board that racially segregated prisoners has made it easier on everyone.  The reason why this cannot stand is because people will start thinking that if it works in prisons will it work in schools.  And that is the real reason why prisons cannot be segregated.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are probably complete strangers to each other, sharing living quarters that are more cramped and intimate than anything most of us will ever experience, and prison authorities want cellmates to get along. Size and physical condition are part of the calculation, since no one wants to put a weakling in with a gorilla.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
If size and physical condition may be part of the calculation, then why not also ethnicity? Seriously, WHY NOT?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question that shouldn&rsquo;t even have to be asked. But then, most of the questions on AmRen shouldn&rsquo;t need to be asked, either. The answers to these questions are mostly common sense. Of course, common sense is in short supply in BRA (Black Run America*), isn&rsquo;t it? </p>
<p>Just like the common sense of keeping prisoners amongst their own kind&hellip; so as to keep them from killing each other. The idea that activist judges can somehow legislate away ancient racial animosities   &mdash;   in the racially-charged atmosphere of California prisons, of all places!   &mdash;   would be laughable if it didn&rsquo;t have such serious consequences. </p>

		<p>That was along article, but we don&rsquo;t know how they are going to apply this decision by the high court. That will be interesting. </p>
<p>This is such a whacky decision and unrealistic that they should just ignore the decision, and run the prisons as best they can.</p>
<p>From what I know the Mexican prisoners run the CDC. They are well organized and I can see real bloodshed moving forward. </p>
<p>Again, the court doesn&rsquo;t have the insight on such an important situation and the decision should just be ignored. Hey, what are they going to do - fine the state? It&rsquo;s already broke. </p>

		<p>I feel sorry for any White that has to go to prison or jail in today&rsquo;s America. The &#8220;crimes&#8221; that many commit are drug charges and although I HATE drugs and what it has done to our young, it is such a BAD addiction that jail is no place for Whites to be. It would be cheaper to put them into a LOCKED rehabilitation camp (segregated, of course) than to put them with hardened black criminals.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the guards in these jails and prisons are now mostly black or Mexican and hate Whites and they have also been accused of bringing the drugs into the prisons to begin with! They have also set up Whites to be attacked and beaten or worse by the black/Mexican inmates.</p>

<p>One of the main arguments in opposition to why blacks are in prison disproportionately is because they are specifically being targeted more (white police cars don&rsquo;t go after rich white, etc).</p>
<p>While Mr. Taylor disproves this with victimization studies correlating with FBI reports, I wonder what your take is on the argument mentioned above?</p>

<p>That was over 25 yrs ago and she has since renewed her lease on that statement. Big surprise.</p>
<p>BTW, Reagan appointed O&rsquo;Connor as a favor to his daughter who wanted a woman. He also extended &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; to Hindus and Hasidic Jews (Muslims are currently lobbying to be included). Then there was the disastrous amnesty for illegals. Reagan has convinced me that we shall not find salvation in the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Were they able to substantively disprove an &#8216;assumed&rsquo; racist bias in favor of the greater needs for security for the inmates in this transfer/evaluation period?</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t know better, I&rsquo;d assume that they were setting up a system whose emminent crisis-point violence was a justification for outside intervention but I haven&rsquo;t heard California declare &#8216;moral or economic failure&rsquo; in the prison system yet.</p>

		<p>Prisoners should be segregated from each other by race for two reasons. One is they will kill, rape, assault and harass each other every chance they get. A white inmate especially is in danger of being attacked by dozens of black or Hispanics behind bars, but no inmate who is among the minority in a particular prison or jail&rsquo;s population is safe. This leads to the second reason for separating prisoners by race. The racial violence will spill over into the streets, this is where blacks, Hispanics and whites alike develop intense hatred towards each other, and that will lead to more trouble in the outside world.</p>
