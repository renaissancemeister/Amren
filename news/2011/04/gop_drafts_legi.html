			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Bennett, Los Angeles Times, March 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congressional Republicans are drafting legislation that would require the federal government to develop a plan to add more fencing, sensors, agents and even drones to stop every illegal entry into the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Democrats&rsquo; Senate majority means the latest legislation is unlikely to pass, but the goal may be more political. By continuing to spearhead such measures, Republicans, who feel they are in agreement with most voters, hope to force Democrats to take a position on immigration issues in advance of the 2012 campaign.</p>
<p>The debate&rsquo;s change in tone also comes as census data show that Latinos comprise the fastest-growing block of voters, potentially a complicating factor for Republican strategists. The number of Latino voters is increasing most in states that in 2010 gained congressional seats and Electoral College votes, according to a study released in January by the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p>Immigration skirmishes seem to excite the Republican base, said Wayne Cornelius, a professor emeritus at UC San Diego who has spent more than 40 years studying cross-border migration.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short-term, they calculate they can gain more votes with these hard-liner proposals,&#8221; he said, but some may have qualms about alienating Latinos.</p>
<p>A Republican strategist acknowledged there was debate within the party about how to handle immigration enforcement without driving away Latino voters who might otherwise agree with the fiscal conservative aspects of the party platform. Republican activists have said they think some Latino voters support the GOP position on immigration.</p>
<p>But many Republicans want a modernized immigration system that is consistent with the values of an immigrant nation, and those party members who speak loudly against reforms are a &#8220;vocal minority,&#8221; said the strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the debate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Republican effort to push the Homeland Security Department to take a tougher stance on immigration enforcement follows a request last year by all seven Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee that asked the department to determine how much money it needed to deport every illegal immigrant the government encountered.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Department has not estimated the cost, but a 2005 report by the Center for American Progress concluded it would require $206 billion over five years to deport the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Rep. Candice S.] Miller&rsquo;s proposed legislation would require the Homeland Security Department to give Congress a five-year plan to bring unlawful entries and smuggling down to nearly zero, and let Congress decide whether to fund it. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) and 10 other Republicans have agreed to co-sponsor the bill, which could be introduced as early as Thursday.<br>

		<p>Note the following lie from The Center for American Progress:  &#8220;It would require $206 billion over five years to deport the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>That calculates to roughly $19,000/illegal.  Give me a break!  All we have to do is deny jobs, food stamps, welfare, subsidized housing, health care, legal aid, and free education to illegals, and the vast majority will simply go home on their own. They come here for the money and the free stuff. </p>

		<p>Instead of Hispandering, in the vain hope of peeling away a few Hispanic votes from the Democrats (which will only alienate the base of the Republican party), the GOP should focus on winning the votes of white independents and Democrats who are increasingly coming to realize that this country is being invaded. A strong position on illegal immigration will tap into the 70% of voters who want the immigration laws enforced. Let the cheap labor (treason) lobby go back to the Democrats&hellip;.not many votes there anyway.</p>

		<p>I concur with Anonymous at 6:19 p.m., that &#8220;All we have to do is deny jobs, food stamps, welfare, subsidized housing, health care, legal aid, and free education to illegals,&#8221; but even if we had to spend the $206 billion to deport them all, that would at least be money well-spent, unlike where most of our tax money goes.  How much have we already SPENT on their housing, health care (Medicaid), food stamps, etc.?  Not to mention cost of prosecuting and incarcerating the hundreds of thousands in our jails and prisons for non-immigration related crimes.</p>

		<p>A Republican strategist says that he doesn&rsquo;t want to drive &#8220;away Latino voters who might otherwise agree with the fiscal conservative aspects of the party platform.&#8221; Gimme a break. This &#8220;strategist&#8221; must live in the same delusional dream world as the ones who think they can appeal to Latinos using social issues while ignoring the 50 percent illegitamacy rate and the much higher abortion rate that they have. These hispanics are never gonna vote for &#8220;fiscal conservatives&#8221; as long as they drop out of school even more so than the blacks, have even more teen pregnancies than them, and continue to have lots of babies out of wedlock. Of course, the lower average IQ of mestizos no doubt is a significant reason why they are poorer and therefore eschew limited government. </p>

<p>To reinforce Anonynous #1&rsquo;s point, the vast majority of illegal aliens would self-deport   &mdash;  - at no expense to the U. S. government   &mdash;  - if the large welcome mat the federal government extends to illegal aliens were withdrawn.  The technical term such a reverse migration is &#8220;attrition through enforcement.&#8221; Attrition through enforcement&rsquo;s key elements:</p>
<p>*Secure the borders. </p>
<p>*Apply serious worksite enforcement. [The Obama administration, for example, quickly eliminated the dramatic work site raids, which included deportation of the illegal workers, that were commonplace in the final two years of the Bush administration. Restoring these alone would send a message that America is serious about enforcing its laws and that self-deportation is a good choice.] </p>
<p>*Eliminate document fraud. </p>
<p>*Reform unwitting accomplices: The Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service (both of which agencies know of millions using duplicate or phoney SS numbers), do not communicate with ICE.</p>
<p>*Encourage state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>*Eliminate state and local benefits to illegal aliens.<br>
 <br>
* * *</p>
<p>The Center for American Progress estimate that it would cost &#8220;$206 billion over five years to deport the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally&#8221; is, of course, nonsense. </p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service, for example, audits 1.2 million individual tax returns of 130 million filed each year. In other words, the IRS gets good compliance by auditing less than one percent of income tax returns. </p>
<p>How easy it would be to get compliance with U. S. immigration laws from both employers AND illegal aliens if the federal government conducted spot audits on one percent of employers annually. <br>

		<p>Allow me to help the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee with their requested cost estimate.</p>
<p>Boeing 747 entering arguments: $6455/hr operating cost; 500 seats; ~2000 mile round trip SW USA to Mexico City; 500 mph</p>
<p>Continuing: $6455/hr * 4 hrs = $28520/round trip; or $57/seat</p>
<p>Throw in 2 complimentary Tequilas: add $3/seat so $60/passenger total cost</p>
<p>Figure 25 million illegals, not the LA Times&rsquo; 11 million, so: $60 * 25,000,000 = $1.5 billion</p>
<p>$1.5 billion is less than the approximately $2820 billion in annual social services provided by the federal government alone. Sounds like a profitable project.</p>

		<p>We need to address the fact that the main force in the GOP who favors illegal immigration is the &#8220;business community.&#8221;  These people need to be called out and conservative activists need to target the Chamber of Commerce and other capitalists who support illegal immigration.  Until conservatives as a whole attack the capitalist interests who are working behind the scenes to scuttle immigration enforcement, we will keep losing this battle.  For those who haven&rsquo;t been keeping track, business interests have routed efforts to enforce immigration laws at the state level in the last couple of months.   </p>

<p>None of that does any good if you won&rsquo;t deport. I think they are playing the &#8220;give my buddy a contract for kick backs&#8221; game again. The Republicans seem to like that game. It doesn&rsquo;t take a drone to find an illegal alien. Some thing tells me Republicans don&rsquo;t want to find illegal aliens.  </p>
<p>The average Republican needs to figure out that the Republican party is no different than the Democrats they claim to &#8220;hate&#8221; so much.</p>

		<p>I suppose this is a step in the right direction, but if the Republican Party then turns around and says it wants to expand legal immigration to the third world masses, then there won&rsquo;t be much of a difference. </p>
<p>Eventually, a hard line on illegal immigration must be accompanied by a hard line on legal immigration.</p>

		<p>I agree that if our local, State and Federal governments withheld the &#8216;perks&rsquo; such as jobs, free husing, food stamps and healthcare from illegals that would certainly stem the flow, especially from Mexico but I doubt if that will ever happen in Chicago.  The White population here is happy with being treated as second-class citizens when it comes to jobs, and those other benefits mentioned above and by other writers here.  If any Whties are still working in our City Hall for instance, they are sure to be Liberal Whie women.  Aside from our Police and Fire Departments, I doubt very much if White men total more than 1% of the total number of City empoloyees but it is never mentioned by anyone running for any political office in the City of Chicago.  Under Mayor-Elect Rahm Emanuel it won&rsquo;t get any better because of his ethnic background.  We are really a &#8216;Nation of Sheep&rsquo; it seems to me.</p>

		<p>When will they start to worry about alienating White voters? The time to act is now. Our sovereign territory is being violated and citizens are being killed, yet politicians worry about pandering to Hispanics. It&rsquo;s time to have the guts to act to secure our borders and expel illegals. Did they not learn from last year&rsquo;s election? The majority is getting fed up with the status quo. The politicians need to pay attention to us instead of foreigners.</p>

		<p>The republicans are worried about driving away the Latino vote ?  What percentage of Latinos vote Republican anyway? Did the democrats worry about driving away the white vote when they passed the immigration act of 1965?

		<p>We have to live here.  So whites get the standard &#8216;family treatment&rsquo; psychology which is: &#8220;Shut up or move out, I care not which, if you want democracy, this is your choice: vote D for democrat or R for Republican, the policy remains the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Politicians are, by and large, accomodator/exploitator personalities which is to say that they are always looking for that little crumb that someone else ignored as being unworthy of their time or dangerous in it&rsquo;s social non-conformity. Looking to gather enough crumbs togethre to get their payoff.</p>
<p>And in this, Hispanics and other &#8220;New members?  Woohoo!  What can I promise you?!&#8221; SIGs represent an unmined sector which is not already dominated by ye-olde-money interests as committee member controlled policy shaping.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the real kicker: these idiots ACTUALLY BELIEVE that they are guaranteeing their own job security.  Because you see, the people they &#8216;compete with&rsquo; in their heads are not Juanito and Jamille.  They are you and me.  So the fewer there are of us as a whole, the more their expertise matters at the top to keep the wheels greased and turning.  Economically, politically, the works.  As though decades of failed economic policy that brings about white replacement is actually a good job reference.</p>
<p>Except it ain&rsquo;t so Joe.  And the obvious examples: Zimbabwe = Detroit are just beyond your typical politician&rsquo;s global awareness.  Even as their inability to absorb racial-preferences as statistical norms is as well.</p>
<p>Did I mention that being a politician is like being a prostitute?  Play up every new customer&rsquo;s attributes, hoping for a bigger tip in the end?  That kind of (socially intelligent) personality is _not_ actually a wise one because they will eagerly shovel the dirt out from under someone else&rsquo; half of the dyke, trying to build up their own.</p>
<p>Never realizing that they are all standing on the same seawall and so when the thing gives way, they all drown.</p>
<p>Accomodator = Traitor.  It&rsquo;s probably a gene thing as an expressed enablement behavior pattern.</p>
<p>Which is why we must cut loose and carry on knowing that, amongst ourselves, there is one sure thing that will not change: we are loyal to our own.</p>
<p>Because there is no hope in this house.  And daddy&rsquo;s warnings about being kicked out when we were 18 and wanted our own life now applies nationally as well.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of the GOP trying to pander to nonwhites all the time.  Stop it!  They will never vote for you, they aren&rsquo;t the founding stock of this country, they hate whites, they have the US, they want big government, and they will become another &#8216;victim&rsquo; group we have to take care of like blacks.

		<p>It makes me angry that things have progressed as far as they have.  I remember reading the 1987 edition of Newsweek when they forecast Whites would become a minority by 2050.  It worried me at the time but I quickly forgot about it until they started pushing multiculturalism in the media about 1994 and I started seeing an increasing number of peculiar looking dark people speaking foreign languages in public.  It just doesn&rsquo;t seem possible to me that everything that has transpired over the past 15 or so years could have happened without complicity from so-called right wing leaders.  </p>

 Fine employers that hire them. Eventually they will self deport. Will this be easy? Probably not, no one likes to see other human beings suffer, but if we don&rsquo;t, everbody will start suffering really bad.</p>

Yes, precisely. In his book What is the Matter with Kansas? Thomas Frank argues that Republican politicians love to lose on social issues. These loses anger social conservatives - most of whom are not rich - and convince them that more Republican politicians need to be elected.<br>
 <br>
Thomas Frank was writing about issues pertaining to religion and sexual behavior. Nevertheless, this is even more true for immigration. The people the Republican Party really cares about - employers and investors - benefit from open borders.  This is because a high rate of immigration raises prices, lowers wages, and raises profits. Nevertheless, employers and investors are a small minority of the electorate. In order to win elections the Republican Party needs to win the votes of people who are hurt by policies that benefit employers and investors.<br>
 <br>
The policies advocated by Congressional Republicans do nothing to punish those who hire illegal immigrants. <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that Republicans claim to be better on immigration than Democrats yet nothing ever seems to get done even when the Republicans have majorities in Congress and a President sitting in the White House.  Sixty years of nonwhite immigration and there&rsquo;s no opposition to it even now.  Almost 20 years of allowing illegal immigrants to stream across the border and the best the Republicans can do is vote against amnesty?  That&rsquo;s not a victory it&rsquo;s a defensive strategy and doesn&rsquo;t change the status quo. This current legislation being drafted is tepid at best.  Write some legislation giving states more broader powers in dealing with illegals similar to the Arizona law before parts of it were stripped out by federal courts.  Allow states the ability to round them up and drive or fly them into Mexico.  Have more stringent controls over checking the citizenship status of people applying for any Federal aid whether it&rsquo;s welfare or tuition assistance. </p>
<p>I already know what position the Democrats take on immigration issues.  It couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious.  I want to know what the Republican Party position is because I&rsquo;m not entirely clear on it and that includes the positions of people controlling the RNC. You have several Republicans in Congress who flip flop on the issue depending on whether it&rsquo;s an election year or whether their constituents are giving them a lot of heat on the issue. Then when things quiet down they&rsquo;re back to their old tricks.  John McCain and Lindsay Graham are perfect examples of this.       </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t blame the Mestizos themselves.  They are merely come to glean the crumbs of the White man&rsquo;s table.  Under similar circumstances, I might do the same thing.  Thankfully, my circumstances are congruent with a +3sd IQ and a long line of good breeding.</p>
<p>Before the Hispanics will leave, we&rsquo;ve got to ostracize the White traitors that solicit and employ them.</p>
<p>Recall your basic management training on leadership:  Referent power while formidable is derivative.  It requires the fawning of the awestruck.</p>
<p>We should take a page from the Left&rsquo;s crusades against smoking, &#8220;homophobia&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; itself.  These were not shoved down our throats in one massive diktat.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary.  They were shoved down our throats slowly, over a few decades of unrelenting criticism that wore down our defenses and will to fight one man at a time, one point of resistance at a time.</p>
<p>No, it won&rsquo;t be fun to be that &#8220;stick in the mud&#8221; at the Rotary luncheon.  But no one there will have the guts to remove you for grumbling and after a while, human nature will compel them to avoid pro-immigration ideas altogether.  Even better - you might provoke one of their champions to overreact and discredit his position along with himself.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice, for a change?</p>
<p>Yes it would.  And we can do that immediately.  No permission needed.</p>

		<p>I get the impression and maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, that the Republicans will take a stand against amnesty and procuring measures to stop more illegals from coming but not against removing the ones already here from the country. The big business interests these people cater to don&rsquo;t want a legalized labor force where they&rsquo;ll have to pay medical insurance premiums and other benefits and sometimes even the minimum wage.  They want their Mexicans nice and illegal.   </p>

<p>&#8220;20 years of allowing illegal immigrants to stream across the border and the best the Republicans can do is vote against amnesty? That&rsquo;s not a victory it&rsquo;s a defensive strategy and doesn&rsquo;t change the status quo &hellip;  Then when things quiet down they&rsquo;re back to their old tricks.

<p>Exactly.  Most Republicans vote the right way on Democrat/RINO initiatives to reward illegal immigration.  Check vote talliesm for example, on either of the two Bush-Democrat amnesty drives, OR on the Reid-Obama-Pelosi push for the DREAM Act last fall.</p>
<p>Republicans will be about 85-90 percent of the &#8220;Nay&#8221; votes.  As I recall on the Dream Act, only seven GOP members of Congress, House &amp; Senate, voted for the measure. 95 percent of the GOP voted against it. </p>
<p>But you are right. The GOP has not gone on offense. That must change.  Sure, Reid and the Democratic majority in the Senate and Obama will block it, but it would highlight the differences for voters.  As the economy continues to worsen (and it will), as the social fabric frays further and the absurdity of open borders becomes evermore apparent, that may happen.</p>
<p>The great weakness in the GOP is in presidential level politics, namely early, winner-take-all presidential primaries that allow RNC establishment duds   &mdash;  - like the Bushes, Bob Dole, McCain   &mdash;  - to lock up the nomination early.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s time to stop recoginzing our current government. Democracy no longer works in a majority left wing, multi-cultural society. We need to elect our own goverment, with our own military and judicial system. Liberal judges and liberal politicians want to completely destroy us. We must ignore their authority and create our own nation&hellip;or perhaps take back the ones that were taken from us. This sounds unrealistic and radical but it can be done. If you want solid proof of this possiblity, observe the nation of Isreal. It was created by Jewish refugees who were tired of mass persecution, which included rape, mass murder, and dispossession. They banded together against all odds and created their own nation.  In 60 years, Isreal s grew from a band of motely rebels into a modern, powerful nation. The first Isreali soldiers barely had enough simple rifles. Now they have 600 nuclear warheads.  Whether or not you agree with the nation of Isreal, it was created for the same reasons that plague us.  They were tired of the rape, murder and dispossession. They wanted a nation where they could be safe and thrive, and that kept out all hostile foreign element. White Christians are experiencing the same persecution. We are much larger in number, and we can do even more. If we can cut off our dead weight (white liberals), we can accomplish anything. </p>

		<p> MILLIONS MORE ILLEGAL ALIENS WILL BE HEADING FOR YOUR STATE.</p>
<p>Word of mouth will resonate across the border with Mexico, and internally throughout America and hundreds of thousands of economic illegal aliens will be arriving in lenient States. If illegal aliens think they can get drivers licenses in Washington State, they will be pouring in from everywhere. They will pillage your welfare safety-net for all your impoverished citizens and legal residents, just as they have in the Sanctuary State of California and Nevada.<br>
 </p>
<p>Utah has no conception of what is going to happen to them, once the illegal aliens start whispering to each other? The flood will turn into a deluge and all those under threat in Arizona, may be Texas and in other States building policing laws will become persona non grata. They will materialize in the hundreds of thousands in Salt Lake City, Ogden, anywhere and people with &#8220;foothold babies&#8221; will start lining up for the food Stamps, Medicaid and anything else they can get for free. The kids will suffocate the school system and they will have no choice but to hire more bilingual teachers. These people are well taught on how to wring the most welfare programs from the system, including free breakfasts and lunches for their children.  They are well aware as in California the more babies they conceive that they can receive $600 dollars for each child in their care. One only has to read on the Internet that there is a fraudulent game going on with child tax credits.</p>
<p>The hospitals will be crammed with the newly sick and arrive in the emergency room with 4 or five children and then Utah&rsquo;s old folks, will have to wait 4 hours or more for treatment as the numbers grow. In one hospital in Texas there are a hundred illegal aliens on dialysis machines, costing taxpayers $100.000 dollars annually for each patient. Best to remember that overall that the employer doesn&rsquo;t pay for Guest Workers children or families education, health care, home help, or other programs, the taxpayer does..THAT&rsquo;S WITH ANY SOFT STATE! Explore the Pdf file &#8220;Illegal Aliens and American Medicine.&#8221; <a href="https://tinyurl.com/o6r27" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/o6r27</a>  Remember this is not about honest, law abiding legalized people who are of many religions, creeds or races. This is about illegal immigration and the consequences now and in the immediate future. Anybody who really believes the US government,  or the  leftist  newspapers or  groups with special incentives that there is  &mdash;  ONLY  &mdash;  11 million  unauthorized  persons here,  needs a good psychiatrist?</p>
<p>Just as in the Sanctuary State of California is overwhelmed with welfare classes, so will Utah. Neighborhoods will become the scene of rusty, derelict cars and the business owners will exploit them and enjoy obscene profits. Oh! But we must not forget the growing prominence of DUI (Drunk While Intoxicated.) Hit and runs will begin to escalate and more drug peddlers will move in, to sell their toxic wares to young children. Soon  &mdash;  more prisons will have to be constructed to incarcerate the murderers, kidnappers, home invasion crime, female and children assaults and other criminal enterprises. Just like California, Nevada and other refuge States, your debt will be accelerating because you will be forking out large sums of money like never before, to support Utah&rsquo;s own little invasion. GOD HELP UTAH!! If this law for Guest Workers is found constitutional these illegal persons with their extended families will suddenly appear </p>
<p>To repeat this statistic  &mdash;  that for every 1 dollar spent by illegal immigrants, they receive 3 to 4 dollars in service and public entitlements. According to (FAIR) one hundred and thirteen billion went out the door in federal entitlements, for education, health care and incarcerations; these dollar numbers are not what States payout. Each State has its own cross to bear, with no aid from the US government.</p>
<p>ATTN: Reps. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Jeff Landry (R-La.), and David McKinley (R-W.V.) have co-sponsored H.R.800, the E-LAW Act, that was introduced by Rep. John Carter (R-Texas). The bill would require all employers to use E-Verify on new hires and existing employees within two years. CALL YOUR SENATOR AND REPRESENTATIVE YOU WILL FIND IN THE BLUE PAGES OF YOUR PHONE DIRECTORY DEMANDING H.R.800. The bill also requires the Department of Homeland Security to take steps that remove fraudulent use of the E-Verify system such as illegal aliens using false identification. The bill also increases fines and penalties for employers that knowingly hire illegal aliens, and it reinstates the No-Match program that requires the Social Security Administration to notify employers and individuals where in individual is making contributions into their social security account from multiple employers.</p>
<p>America isn&rsquo;t a melting pot anymore, it&rsquo;s a potential powder keg.<br>
Remember these economic persons don&rsquo;t just arrive from South of the border, they also come into America by jet and overstay their visas for good. Utahans better contact their local Tea Party if they want to fight these decades of illegal immigrant occupation, as the majority of the politicians are uncaring and stay indifferent like that tired, senile Senator Reid (D-NV). My opinion is he returned to Washington, through illegal aliens inundating Nevada used fraudulent absentee ballots. Many organizations as NumbersUSA are looking out for Americans, to build the real fence and stop many of the huge influxes of foreigners before our nation cannot pay its debts to Communist China anymore and foreign investors.</p>

		<p>The Republicans are &#8220;drafting legislation&#8221; that would require the feds to &#8220;develop a plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now THAT&rsquo;s what I call taking decisive action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to address the demographic time bomb that already exists with Mexicans living and working in the country, legally or illegally.</p>
<p>Closing the border now  &mdash;  something that I don&rsquo;t believe for a second they&rsquo;ll actually do  &mdash;  would be like plugging the hole in the Titanic after it&rsquo;s already sunk to the bottom. </p>

		<p>This is not immigration of any type.  We should quit using that word.  It is an invasion of colonizing foreigners with the treasonous complicity of our own government.  I say forced deportation after halting all subsidation and moratorium of an indefinite period on ALL immigration including visas.</p>

		<p>I was going into a convienince store in my small town yesterday and two mexican women entered at the same time.  At check out the filled up the counter with assorted candys, jerky, chips, and pop. I was astonished when they pulled out a welfare card to pay for this garbage.  We need to cut off these services and they will go back to mexico without deporting them.</p>
