			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kendra Marr, The Politico, April 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newt Gingrich has come a long way since criticizing Latinos a few years ago for continuing to speak &#8220;the language of living in a ghetto.&#8221; He&rsquo;s taking Spanish lessons, reaching out to Hispanic community leaders, and supports &#8220;finding a way for residency&#8221; for some illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>But mounting a successful presidential bid means winning over GOP primary activists  &mdash;  many of whom favor a hard-line immigration crackdown  &mdash;  and that means Gingrich&rsquo;s moderate positions could spell big trouble for him in the early-voting states, strategists say. </p>
<p>Of the top Republican prospects for 2012, Gingrich leads in Latino outreach.</p>
<p>He recently attended a Texas conference on strengthening Latino and Jewish dialogue, and regularly publishes op-eds in Spanish. On a Tax Day conference call with tea party activists earlier this month, Gingrich called on Republicans to fight the &#8220;anti-Hispanic&#8221; label.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gingrich launched &#8220;The Americano,&#8221; a bilingual news website for Latino conservatives, and in December hosted a two-day forum featuring prominent Latino politicians, religious figures and business leaders. There he declared, &#8220;We are not going to deport 11 million people. There has to be some zone between deportation and amnesty.&#8221; </p>
<p>And in February he sparred with Howard Dean over the DREAM Act. &#8220;Residency is very different than citizenship,&#8221; Gingrich stressed, proposing that it should be available to people who serve in the military or entered the country as children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The immigration-reduction group NumbersUSA, which waged war on John McCain in 2008, has already set its sights on Gingrich. The group, which advocates stricter controls on both legal and illegal immigration, has given his immigration agenda a D- grade  &mdash;  the worst of its ranking of the GOP presidential contenders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other 2012 Republican candidates haven&rsquo;t gone as far as Gingrich.</p>
<p>Tim Pawlenty has pushed for the increased use of E-Verify, an Internet-based system that allows businesses to determine if their employees are eligible to work. Haley Barbour, when confronted about his lobbying firm&rsquo;s promotion of a path to citizenship for Mexican illegal immigrants, denied his own involvement. Mike Huckabee has said there&rsquo;s zero chance of passing comprehensive immigration reform that includes such a citizenship pathway. Michele Bachmann told an Iowa audience that she whole-heartedly agrees with Republican Rep. Steve King, an immigration hard-line. And Mitch Daniels recently said he expects Indiana&rsquo;s immigration bill to focus more on employers than law enforcement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of all the potential 2012 candidates, it&rsquo;s Gingrich who has been floating new ideas, such as tasking credit card companies with creating guest worker ID cards that track workers&rsquo; legal status with a simple swipe.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lionel Sosa, who has consulted seven Republican presidential campaigns on Hispanic issues, praised Gingrich for being &#8220;upfront&#8221; on immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is far and away the most attractive Republican candidate for Latinos,&#8221; Sosa said. &#8220;He is thoughtful. He has looked into the issue. He understands it, and he feels there is a way to solve the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Gingrich&rsquo;s views won&rsquo;t help him with the tea party, which is expected to be influential in some of the early states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s advocated a multi-step approach that first addresses border security problems and employers hiring illegal workers. And he has been quick to recognize the complexities of deporting people who are married with children, or a student who, say, was smuggled over the border at age 3, but has since graduated from a Texas high school and doesn&rsquo;t speak Spanish.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hispanic groups are banking that Gingrich will stand behind his principles and not pander to his party&rsquo;s conservative base during the primary season.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s not following the McCain approach. He&rsquo;s very courageous,&#8221; said Alfonso Aguilar, the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles.</p>
<p>When his &#8220;ghetto&#8221; comment sparked a firestorm in 2007, Gingrich made amends with a three-minute apology on YouTube  &mdash;  in Spanish. It&rsquo;s that kind of respect that&rsquo;s enabled him to make inroads among Latinos since his days in public office, said Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist who worked with Gingrich during his time in Congress.</p>

		<p>The McCain approach:  lie profusely and sound like a conservative during the campaign.  Or let your VP choice do the heavy talking, while your staff belittles, undermines, and maligns her.</p>
<p>The Gingrich approach:  Once a globalist, always a globalist.  Pander to the open borders crowd unashamedly, knowing you will get all one worlders to vote for you.<br>
To hell with the Whites who built the nation.  To hell with Christians who warn where globalism leads.  To hell with blacks who compete with (and are killed by) Hispanics.<br>
Blacks will never vote for him anyway.</p>
<p>And neither will Whites, if they have any sense left at all.  I know I would sooner shove a sharp stick in my eye than trust another neo-con on ANYTHING.</p>

		<p>Newt has always been a moron. Remember his &#8220;Contract With America&#8221;?  Where did that get us? NOWHERE. No deportations of illegals, no closing down the border, nothing! He is as phoney as most neocons are. They are as bad as the left if not worse because they supposedly &#8220;speak for us&#8221;&hellip;.they are NOT our friends, neither are they patriots. </p>

<p>Comrade Newt, is going to be this election cycle&rsquo;s Bob Dole or John McCain. He is a corrupt old has-been running on the multicultural party line. In short, he will likely be railroaded into the nomination and allow Comrade BO to gain another four years in power!</p>

		<p>Immigration is an issue that divides the elites of both parties from the rank and file. <br>
 <br>
When limousine liberals think of immigration they think of the Statue of Liberty, &#8220;huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&#8221; and so on.<br>
 <br>
Rich Republicans think of becoming richer Republicans, because that is what the present high rate of immigration enables them to become. More immigrants mean more customers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. </p>

		<p>Newt Gingrich: &#8220;One of the things we&rsquo;re doing at Gingrich Communications is we now have a website called The Americano &hellip; We&rsquo;re going to be putting the DREAM Act on that space and we hope to have, before the beginning of the year, with Jeb Bush&rsquo;s efforts and others, a very lively debate about whether or not we can develop a step by step solution to help everybody in America come out from outside the law and find a way to ultimately have every person in this country living within the law. That&rsquo;s got to be our goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gingrich wants to find a way to reward everyone who has illegally entered and remained in America with legal status, i. e., a path to citizenship.</p>
<p>President Obama, President Bush, the Democratic Party, and countless ethnocentric and leftist pressure groups will no doubt stand shoulder to shoulder with Gingrich in his noble quest.<br>

The Republicans need to understand that we are MAD AS HELL and are tired of them throwing Whites under the bus in favor of blacks and Mexicans - who NEVER vote for them in any large number, especially &#8220;the blacks&#8221;. It amazes me that they don&rsquo;t seem to understand that they are just useful idiots and the goal of the non-Whites they pander to is to replace them with one of their own as soon as they have the numbers to do so.  </p>

<p>Great comment and Right On John PM!</p>
<p>I cannot think of a worse choice for president than Newt Gingrich.</p>
<p>First there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<p><i>In his book, Real Change,  Gingrich calls for tripling the number of H1B Visas allotted per year. Given that in the last decade, we have given out as many as 150,000 H1B Visas in a single year, that would amount to as many as 450,000 H1B worker visas annually.</i></p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also this:</p>
<p><i>In 2009, Gingrich began working closely with the Rev. Al Sharpton on the Equality in Education Project, which aspires to close the racial &#8216;achievement gap.&rsquo; He has also been working with Janet Murguia of the National Council of La Raza on the same project.</i></p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the character issue.  Is character important?  YES.  If he treats his &#8220;loved ones&#8221; and own daughters like this, imagine what he might do to the rest of us:</p>
<p>According to Newt&rsquo;s first wife Jackie:</p>
<p><i>He walked out in the spring of 1980&hellip;. By September, I went into the hospital for my third surgery. The two girls came to see me, and said, &#8216;Daddy is downstairs. Could he come up?&rsquo; When he got there, he wanted to discuss the terms of the divorce while I was recovering from my surgery.</i> </p>
<p><i>He also graciously said &#8216;She isn&rsquo;t young enough or pretty enough to be the President&rsquo;s wife.&rsquo;</i> </p>
<p><i>The hospital visit wasn&rsquo;t the end of it, either. Jackie had to take Newt to court to get him to contribute for bills, as utilities were about to be cut off.</i></p>
<p>Unbelievable that anyone would consider Gingrich presidential material for the Republicans.  Even more unbelievable that any White would deign to vote for this draft-dodging, pot smoking adulterer who wants to amnesty all illegal immigrants and double the number of H-1B visas.</p>
<p><i>We have to find policies that extend to every American, and that includes people who are not yet legal &hellip; In the next five to ten years everyone living and working the United States will be legal.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Newt Gingrich</p>
<p><br>
Bon</p>

		<p>Yes, I think he is pandering. The only silver lining to it is getting Obama out of office. There&rsquo;s so many Mexicans and Hispanics now that they really can&rsquo;t be ignored anymore.</p>
<p>I understand everyone&rsquo;s concern, but I&rsquo;d do almost anything to get Obama out of office. Anything.</p>

		<p>After John Edwards, Newt Gingrich is the emptiest suit you can ask for in a politician.. The guy would sell his mother to become president. He has no shame and lies with chilling ease. He should embody all the bad things people think of when they think of an incompetent politician.</p>
<p>On another note, pandering to the Hispanic vote won&rsquo;t have to happen if we just protect our borders! They might breed faster than us but not that faster; it&rsquo;s the illegal immigration that is making their population growth exponential.</p>
<p>I would like to end with a scary comment that a friend of mine made. We were discussing issues and I told him that America is becoming a 3rd world nation and he said &#8220;We already are. The only reason it&rsquo;s not obvious is because we are living off the credit card (national debt) but once that runs out, the true nature of our nation&rsquo;s condition will be exposed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a piece of rubber steak for Gingrich to chew on:  Outside of Cubans, a one-ethnic one-state one-issue fluke constituency, Hispanics almost never give a Republican general election candidate more votes than the Democrat in a statewide election.  A &#8220;good&#8221; result would be the circa 40% of the Hispanic vote in Texas Bush 43 got for his two campaigns for Governor of Texas and then in 2004 for Presidential re-election among Texas Hispanics.  But still, 40 is less than 60.</p>

		<p>I remember very well back in the 70s when Newt began his political career trying to win the congressional seat that represented my district in Georgia.  He lost the first two times, but was finally elected in &#8216;78 when Jack Flynt retired from office.  Even then he struck me as being something of a hippie dip enviro freak.  The first time he challenged Flynt, he tried to make an issue out of the fact that Jack didn&rsquo;t vote for the 64&#8221;Civil Rights Act.&#8221;  Fact is doing that cost Newt votes, and he never raised that canard again.  It was only after he got to Washington that he became so skilled into making all the goobers think he was &#8220;conservative.&#8221;  I never trusted the carpetbagging shyster.</p>

<p>With all due respect, it is precisely that attitude that has allowed the Rupublicans to drift ever leftward, ever more Globalist/interventionist, etc. It isn&rsquo;t all about, &#8220;gettin&rsquo; Obama out.&#8221; At least having an Obama in office has awakened a few intellectually slumbering Whites to our racial plight&hellip;far more than a McCain or Gingrich would ever accomplish. </p>
<p>Big picture man, big picture! </p>

		<p>Hey there, Republicans.  I don&rsquo;t know if you noticed, or cared to, but us &#8216;racist white conservatives&rsquo; were the ones that have voted for you all these years and got you where you are.  Yeah.  So it might be nice if you catered to us since we are what America is and since we are the only people  &mdash;  and the most patriotic people, too  &mdash;  who vote for you.</p>

<p>I agree. The only time I vote republican is when it will actually provide a tangible benefit to my own interests, which is usually the majority of the time. I voted for Chuck Baldwin because I thought it was better to have Obama win the election and wake up people who thought he was really post-racial. Mccain would have taken most of the same positions on issues as Obama, anyway, and white conservatives would be none the wiser.     </p>

		<p>Newt Gingrich is nothing more than Jack Kemp redux, pretending that the Third World-ization of America is really a &#8220;conservative&#8221; process that requires the GOP to reach out.  No thanks.  It&rsquo;s Tancredo or stay at home for me.</p>
