<h1>Moon Angry Over Perceived Racial Bias Toward Newton</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Freeman, CBSSports.com, March 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The words of Warren Moon carry tremendous weight. He&rsquo;s one of professional football&rsquo;s historic figures, both for his tremendous skill and his relevance as an African-American thrower. </p>
<p>So when Moon speaks about quarterback Cam Newton people should listen. When Moon says what he did during an extensive conversation with CBSSports.com about Newton and race, more than a few will. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>Moon was extremely angry over what he perceives as racially biased treatment of Newton by media and fans and was impassioned in his defense of Newton. </p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the criticism he&rsquo;s receiving is unfortunate and racially based,&#8221; Moon said. &#8220;I thought we were all past this. I don&rsquo;t see other quarterbacks in the draft being criticized by the media or fans about their smile or called a phony. He&rsquo;s being held to different standards from white quarterbacks. I thought we were past all this stuff about African-American quarterbacks, but I guess we&rsquo;re not. </p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there is racism in every walk of society. We&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress in this country. But racism is still there. I just thought in the sports arena we were beyond it. I think the way Cam is being treated shows we&rsquo;re not.&#8221; </p>
<p>Moon added: &#8220;The thing that makes me laugh is the question of can he [Newton] come out of the spread offense? Can he run a pro offense? Colt McCoy came out of the spread offense and very few people raised that issue about him. So did Sam Bradford. Same thing. Very few questions asking if Bradford could run a pro offense. Some of these questions about Cam are more about his intellect. It&rsquo;s blatant racism, some of it. </p>
<p>&#8220;When I played I fought some of this. Guys like myself and Randall Cunningham, we were playing for a bigger calling. We were playing for guys like Cam and others. It&rsquo;s disappointing to see some of this stuff still exists.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some of you will hate what Moon says. Some will nod their head in agreement. What&rsquo;s clear is that Moon has the courage to discuss Newton in such honest terms. </p>
<p>Moon&rsquo;s words carry weight and they just started an interesting conversation. </p>

<p>I bet you not even one in a thousand people you stop randomly on the street could tell you who he is.</p>
<p><i>So did Sam Bradford. Same thing. Very few questions asking if Bradford could run a pro offense.</i></p>
<p>As someone who lives in the town whose team drafted Sam Bradford, yes there definitely were those questions.  But unlike Cam Newton, Bradford&rsquo;s pre-draft workouts were impressive.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen, and soon, is that blacks will totally take over the NFL as they have the NBA. When that happens, the whites that were &#8220;best suited&#8221; to be quaterback will dwindle away. Not because there aren&rsquo;t enough of them, but because the smartest of them will go in other directions. The remaining stock of NFL black quarterbacks will &#8220;thrill the crowds&#8221; with their &#8220;athleticisim&#8221; and they will run for lots of yards, but they will never attain the greatness of their long gone predecessors! The remaining few white quarterbacks will achieve greatness until the politically correct society washes them out to be replaced by less intelligent and less &#8220;skilled&#8221; black quarterbacks!<br>
Welcome to the new world!</p>

		<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress in this country. But racism is still there.&#8221;</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Racism is rife within the black and other non-white communities, but especially among blacks.</p>
<p>Their hateful racist rhetoric is surpassed only by their collective violence against whites and other races.</p>
<p>And, the unfortunate thing is that the more that is given to them the more racist and violent they get.</p>
<p>This black president that was supposed to promote a racial healing has made matters far worse by excusing black pathologies and promoting unqualified people to positions that they can&rsquo;t effectively do.  His dumbing down of test scores throughout federal and local governments is making a real mess of things.</p>
<p>And, who is Warren Moon?</p>

		<p>Please Mr. Moon, explain how pointing out the lack of intelligence in a person is racist.  I that&rsquo;s right, I forgot, he&rsquo;s black.  We can&rsquo;t criticize him, sorry.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t name him, but remember the basket case from Texas that won the Heisman and ended up in Tennessee?  Or the bust that got cut from Oakland?</p>
<p>These were all black quarterbacks that had the IQ of someone mentally challenged, literally.  Nothing can be used to make a draft pick bust-proof, but intelligence is extremely important.  If this was a white QB, Moon wouldn&rsquo;t have said a thing.</p>

		<p>Remember, this was ONE previously-unknown NFL scout who said this about Newton, yet here we are in a controversy that seeks to explain &#8220;systemic white racism&#8221; from the vacuous Warren Moon who&rsquo;s name I haven&rsquo;t heard in ten years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to rag on Cam Newton, although he has had his troubles in the past (stolen laptop).  He&rsquo;s obviously talented, but being a QB in the NFL is the toughest thing both physically and mentally in professional sports.  Other recent blacks (Young and Russell) haven&rsquo;t had the mental toughness to deflect criticism and become stars like the Mannings, Rogers, Brees, Brady, Rivers, Romo, etc. even though Young and Russell arguably had tremendously better college careers than most of the white QBs I mentioned.</p>
<p>I remember an old, white dofus for a sports columnist (Woody Paige) brag about how Al Davis (the Raiders&rsquo; owner) was progressive enough to draft &#8220;an African American quarterback number one.&#8221;  Of course, good ole Al did  &mdash;  and any Raiders fan can tell you how Russell&rsquo;s poor attitude prevented him from being successful in the NFL.  Unfortunately, areas in sports where blacks are rightly underrepresented due to the intelligence needed (coaches, GMs, QBs, scouting) are areas where the race-baiters are out in full force.  Not even in sports can blacks accept their impressive over-represented numbers and leave well enough alone.  No, we whites have to hear more of how &#8220;racist&#8221; a society we built.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re an NFL GM, you better do your due diligence if you&rsquo;re thinking of using a high draft pick on a QB, and therefore you&rsquo;ll be paying him a nice hunk of coin, that money mainly being out of the pockets of the consortium of billionaires for whom you work.  QB is just too important a position in the league these days; They don&rsquo;t call it a quarterbacks league for nothing.</p>
<p>Besides athletic skills of a certain variety, it also takes a lot of character to be an NFL QB, because even beyond the physical demands, it&rsquo;s a high pressure bright spotlight calling.  Mr. Newton has displayed that his character can be a little deficient (stolen laptop, &#8220;son of a preacher man,&#8221;   &mdash;   Believe me, he knew his father was pimping him out after he transferred out of Florida).  And his work ethic is suspect, from what I hear.</p>

		<p>I am disapointed to hear the comments of Mr. Moon, who I have previously thought thought quite well of. In the 1980&rsquo;s my brother dated the daughter of a Houston Oilers coach, and through that relationship, had dinner at Mr. Moon&rsquo;s house on at least one occasion. Way back then he spoke of Warren Moon as a friend. A shame to hear&hellip;</p>

		<p>Hey Warren&hellip;maybe some don&rsquo;t like Newton because he&rsquo;s an academic cheat and a laptop thief?  Grow up and stop excusing disgusting black behavior by hiding behind racism.  That word is losing its luster. And that&rsquo;s why liberals of all races and ethnicities are increasingly hysterical.</p>

		<p>I agree with Warren Moon. He is no dummy in fact behaved himself for 15 years and never shot or raped anybody that came to light. Newton is also no dummy. He knows all about computers. In fact he stole a lap top and was smart enough to throw it out the window when the campus cops closed in. Most black foot ball players use them as door stoppers for the women`s shower room in their co-ed dorms. One other thing, despite his latest inane rant, warren Moon was one of the bravest and most competitive ball players whoever strapped on cleats and I feel honored to be able to have followed his career from the CFL to Canton.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s called the Wonderlic test - an abbreviated form of an IQ test.  The reason the NFL gives this test to college recruits is to gauge their ability to comprehend complex offensive and defensive schemes.  Put another way, if you give a quarterback a 3&#8221; binder full of plays and he is borderline retard, he is not going to be able to comprehend all that information in a timely manner.  A nose tackle, on the other hand, it is probably not as important. </p>
<p>You can go here to take a sample test:  <a href="https://walterfootball.com/draftwonderlic.php" rel="nofollow">https://walterfootball.com/draftwonderlic.php</a></p>
<p>By the way, the WHITE quarterback out of Alabama posted a perfect score this year.  </p>

		<p>I confess to clicking onto this story as, in my English innocence, I though it was about the Reverend Moon, who staged mass weddings in Korea, who is challenging the racial aspect of the Newton theory about falling apples and I simply could not see the relevance! Well, that certainly taught me a lesson. However, I could probably put forward a credible argument about mass weddings versus gravity but not for the life of me could I understand anything at all about this story as the language and phraseology is totally alien to me. I notice that the black keys on a piano are separated by lots of white keys, and if all the black keys were to mass together, then history teaches us that that total chaos would be the outcome and it would be the end of everything. Have I got it about right?</p>

<p>Sorry for your state of disappointment, but I could have saved you a lot of grief and heartache from the get-go.  Remember, Warren Moon is black.  No matter how decent he is, nor non-criminal he is, or how congenial he is, his real true team uniform was the one he was born with.</p>
<p>Same for us.</p>
<p>By the way, I know this isn&rsquo;t a problem here, it&rsquo;s more so with the neo-cons and lamestream conservatives and the (not so) &#8220;color blind&#8221; wing of the Tea Party movement.  But these Herman Cain and Allen West type figures are the same way.  They&rsquo;re both black when you get right down to it.  They&rsquo;ll always be pro-black, and in terms of practical politics, will always be obstacles at best and outright enemies at worst in our effort to combat black crime and deviancy.  Even the most &#8220;conservative&#8221; of blacks (see the AR article quoting Walter Williams) will never come around to racial realism or white nationalism   &mdash;   Their canard, as an AR poster said in the Walter Williams story, is that some externality, something that some &#8220;liberal white&#8221; is &#8220;doing wrong,&#8221; is to blame for the racial achievement and outcome gap.  They&rsquo;ll never except genetic determinism, and they can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re black.  They root for the home team.</p>

		<p>Are blacks and browns immune any longer from a &#8221; racism &#8221; charge   &mdash;  - No. They epitomize &#8221; racism &#8221; by their dependency on Whites for all modern creature comforts, jobs, education, medicine, etc., racist, minority privileged laws concerning every aspect of American life; especially in education and jobs; yet they are never appreciative but express anger.  Warren Moon has always expressed anti-White sentiments.  About &#8221; Cam &#8221; being uniquely singled out for leadership doubt in the N.F.L.; similar,but worse charges has been leveled at Denver&rsquo;s Tim Tebow in spite of winning the Heisman trophy in college; what selective, short, memory Moon has in his make-up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As cops were about to search his room, Newton (then a backup to Florida QB Tim Tebow) was overheard on a cellphone telling someone, &ldquo;There was a computer and I took it.&rdquo; After noting that he had thrown the laptop out of the window, Newton remarked, &ldquo;Huh!

		<p>Time for a Flashback, to refresh the pathetically inadequate memories of those who heap praise on Warren Moon:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Comeback was a NFL playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers played January 3, 1993. It featured the Bills recovering from a 32-point deficit to win in overtime, and it remains the largest comeback in NFL history. (The largest comeback in a regular season game still remains the San Francisco 49ers comeback from a 35-7 deficit in the second quarter against the New Orleans Saints on December 7, 1980.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally, I watched that game - and I remember laughing my hind parts off, as I watched the &#8216;great&rsquo; Warren Moon do one of the following:  (1) On National TV, before one of the biggest television audiences to ever watch a football game - display one of the most monumental, unforgettable, humiliating &#8216;choking acts&rsquo; ever committed on a football field by any overrated athlete in NFL history by blowing a 32 point lead, or, (2) Do a really good impression of how to deliberately throw a ball game, that almost looked to me like an audition for a crime syndicate of a sleazy gambling enterprise.   </p>
<p>Incidentally, that one game was not the ONLY playoff game or game of major significance that I watched where Warren Moon fell apart like a cheap suitcase under pressure.    And, as for his &#8216;successes&rsquo; in the Canadian Football League - he was playing primarily against talent that would have been 3rd-string in the American NFL.  </p>
<p>In conclusion, Warren Moon reveals himself to be just one more whiny, race-card hustling, chip-on-his-shoulder, white-hating black who harbors zero gratitude for being allowed to make millions of dollars playing a kid&rsquo;s game while living in a nation built by whites.   </p>
<p>Maybe he would have been happier, and perhaps he could have won a few Super Bowls, had he instead pursued a career playing for the Zimbabwe Football League.  </p>

		<p>Significant &#8220;racism&#8221; occurs at practically all levels of sports, especially at the college/professional level directed toward Whites, and it&rsquo;s not motivated by what you might suspect, that is, that blacks are superior to Whites when it comes to athletics. While it may be true that &#8220;White men can&rsquo;t jump&#8221;, Whites excel in many other areas necessary to excel in the sports arena.

		<p>Remember when people used to question the intelligence of Terry Bradshaw?  was that racism?  Blacks continually shout down the rain barrel, and of course only the media listens down the barrel.  </p>
<p>Cam is not  very smart, he is glib, he is a thief and a thug, but oh yes, he can run and jump. His father is a payoff master, lil cam couldn&rsquo;t last four years at a real school&hellip;he is perfect for the nfl.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Warren attempted to trivialize his apparent efforts to strangle Felicia by claiming that this was not a case of domestic violence but rather a &#8220;domestic dispute&#8221; that had gotten out of hand&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Racism is rife within the black and other non-white communities, but especially among blacks. Their hateful racist rhetoric is surpassed only by their collective violence against whites and other races.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
#3, whiteraven, I wish I could have been the one to write those insightful words.</p>
<p>Warren Moon, a man whose words carry &#8220;tremendous weight?!&#8221; As I recall, he was a mediocre quarterback who drifted between the CFL and NFL, several teams, and spent much of his career as a backup. To be fair, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to be a quarterback in the NFL  &mdash;  not even a mediocre one  &mdash;  but it seems a bit of an exagerration to think we should all stop what we&rsquo;re doing and listen whenever he says something.</p>
<p>Incurably racist me&hellip; I had to think for a minute to recall that Warren Moon was even a person of color.</p>

		<p>I see these comments here everytime a black idiot sports player is in the news.  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t watch sports!&#8221;  &#8220;I hate sports, don&rsquo;t you?&#8221; &#8220;Whites like me hate sports&#8221;.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t get it.  Who invented these wonderful games?  Who, even now, oversees &amp; supports them?</p>
<p>Clue:  not blacks or 3rd worlders.</p>
<p>I guess all of us can&rsquo;t get our thrills from PBS or whatever it is that all you negatators like.</p>

		<p>Warren Moon: over-rated bust!</p>
<p>Cam Newton: thug in a jersey!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the NFL is ina  &#8220;lock out&#8221;. Maybe it will open the eyes of some of the sheeple fans out there. Without white money they are nothing!</p>
