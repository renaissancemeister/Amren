<p>A survey conducted last month shows 46% of GOP voters in the state believe interracial marriage should be illegal  &mdash;  a plurality of the people questioned.</p>
<p>Forty percent felt mixed-race weddings should remain legal, while 14% said they were not sure in the survey conducted by Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted between March 24 and 27, showed 76% of the respondents considered themselves somewhat or very conservative.</p>

<p>Since it is the offspring who are hurt by these  unions&hellip;confused as to their identity&hellip;.mixed marriages should be disallowed.  Selfish, ignorant blacks aren&rsquo;t aware enough to understand the conflict mixed parentage is to a kid&hellip;and those that do don&rsquo;t care&hellip;. and foolish whites are just to imbecilic to understand the impact of their deeds.</p>

		<p>I believe in freedom, and as such, I don&rsquo;t think making interracial marriage illegal is a good idea. I went to a friends wedding three years ago and I was surprised to notice that three (out of five) of my friends who also attended had dates/girlfriends who were Oriental. As most people, of whatever ethnicity or race, feel most comfortable with those similar to themselves, I don&rsquo;t think that interracial marriage will ever be a threat to the integrity of any race.</p>

		<p>Having never been to Mississippi (or Alabama, South Carolina, etc.), I have always wondered if the old Southern ways lived on down there or not.  According to this poll, it looks like Dixie is alive and well.  Or at least half of it is.  46% is much higher than I expected, and remember that is just the people who think miscegenation should be illegalized, not counting those who oppose it morally but don&rsquo;t believe the government should have a say in peoples&rsquo; marriages.  I assume there are many more Mississippians who oppose miscegenation in their own families but checked either &#8220;not sure&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; when asked whether it should be illegalized or not.</p>
<p>P.S. - on the original article, they have a readers&rsquo; poll asking your opinion of the revelation that Mississippians are anti-miscegenation.  Interestingly enough, the three choices are basically &#8220;I&rsquo;m ashamed to share a country with these people,&#8221; &#8220;I disagree with them, but everyone is entitled to their opinion,&#8221; and &#8220;I don&rsquo;t really follow politics.&#8221;  REALLY!?!  They just reported that half of the GOP voters of a state of over four million residents are anti-miscegenation, and they don&rsquo;t have a choice that states, &#8220;I AGREE with them.&#8221;?!?!?  I love New York, but some New Yorkers are so damn arrogant.  I think maybe the editors think that absolutely no-one in NYC could possibly agree with these &#8220;ignorant rednecks,&#8221; so why even make that an option in their poll.</p>

		<p>This is being pilloried in the press, but I was happy to read it. I am glad so many still understand the stakes. Every mixed marriage is a loss for us, we just don&rsquo;t have the numbers to long endure this trend. </p>
<p>I love white families, and wonder what is wrong with whites who show no interest in their own future. They remind me of something a middle-school teacher once said to a class I was in. <br>
We were so rowdy she threatened collective punishment. This failed to quell us. She then said,&#8221;I thought self-preservation was a general trait.&#8221; We all received the promised sanction.</p>

		<p>Being a Libertarian I have to disagree about allowing the State or Fed Gov to decide this issue and create a LAW forbidding it.  However, I agree that interracial marriage is foolhardy and should be both condemned and education made available to warn against such an act.</p>

		<p>Interracial marriage should be illegal, as it&rsquo;s not in the best interests of any children the marriage might produce. There are laws against people having children with close relatives because of the genetic dangers of inbreeding. If the law can protect children against the genetic dangers of inbreeding, it should also protect children against the genetic problems of miscegenation. The MSM often reports that the Loving vs. Virginia case made laws against interracial marriage unconstitutional and unenforcable. What this case actually decided was that laws which only apply to one race are unconstitutional, as Virginia&rsquo;s law only prohibited whites from intermarrying. The best solution would be to pass laws which prohibit all races from engaging in miscegenation.</p>

		<p>Regardless of what one thinks of interracial marriage, laws against it would now be almost useless.  A large percentage of black men apparently don&rsquo;t marry anybody.  <br>
When such laws did exist, they were on the books only in certain states.  Some outlawed white/black unions, some white/Native American, some white/Oriental, or any combination.  People could just go to another state and wed.  The real pressure came from the danger that people could be ostracized or brutalized if they didn&rsquo;t follow local mores.  </p>

<p>No, poster #1. Sounds like you feel sorry for them. I sure don&rsquo;t! Those same &#8220;kids&#8221; will grow up looking for a White partner to mate with and create even more &#8220;mulattos&#8221;, just as a pure black does. Heaven help us because we sure don&rsquo;t help ourselves. </p>
<p> It is ONLY the WHITE race that is hurt, genocided and demolished by these unions. ALL those kids from those unions know EXACTLY what their identity is! They can never be White.  Look at Obama for one example. Which side does he align himself with?  EVERY mulatto I know aligns themselves with their black parents side.</p>

<p>    Things have changed in the South, and not for the better in my opinion, but white people are still more racially conscious down here. We have lived with the blacks for centuries and know their good and bad aspects very well. With some of us, we never became Neo-Confederates because we never stopped being Confederates.</p>

		<p>I for one am not in favor of government controlling people&rsquo;s private lives. Too much of that has already been put in place. However I feel that it&rsquo;s the duty of parents to instill racial pride in their children and I don&rsquo;t mean that they should instill hatred for others but rather to let them know that we as Euro-Americans have a natural instinct to want to perpetuate ourselves just as do all organisms. </p>

		<p>Since when does the GOP leadership ever listen to the voices of those they claim to represent? More than 80% (a large portion of those are likely GOP) of Americans want our immigration laws enforced, yet such want does not inspire our government (including the GOP) to enforce current immigration law against invading mestizos ; who are in the midst of their reconquista to replace white Americans as the new majority. </p>
<p>How in the world would we ever expect this same government to pass (federal) laws to further protect our glorious race? Of course mixed marriages are detrimental to our white race, but wasn&rsquo;t that the plan all along, being perpetrated under the guise of &ldquo;multiculturalism and diversity?&rdquo; In order for multiculturalism and diversity to work, a white must be excluded from consideration. Wouldn&rsquo;t the whole thing be easier if there were simply no longer any whites around to complicate matters? </p>
<p>Is there any reason to believe our government has any interest in protecting our race from anything given the past 40 years of actions (inactions) on their part?</p>
<p>The real question to ask is how many of our elected representatives are currently in mixed race relationships/marriages?<br>

		<p>How do you define what constitutes interracial marriages anyways ? Not every group is clearly Nonwhite. There are grey areas like Armenians, Italians, Jews, Greeks, Turks, Albanians, etc.</p>
<p>Also is a racially pure White person marries somebody who is 1/8 Native American but mostly White just as equally interracial as a White person who marries a Black person ?</p>
<p>Banning &#8220;interracial marriages&#8221; opens up a whole can of worms.</p>
<p>Besides the reason White people are becoming a minority in the U.S is not because White people are dating and marrying outside their race in record numbers because we are definitely not. The reason White people are becoming a minority in the U.S is because of illegal immigrants from south of the border who are living in the U.S.</p>

		<p>GREAT!  The more people think Mississippians are cross-burning, mob-lynching demons, the fewer people will move here!  </p>
<p>The fact that 99.9% of Mississippi&rsquo;s Black Republicans (I&rsquo;m guessing) think Interracial Marriage should be illegal is something that won&rsquo;t be acknowledged in New York.  </p>
<p>And yes: I imagine that Black Democrats would respond not too differently to such a poll.  Mississippi&rsquo;s Blacks generally are enthusiastically behind any sort of hateful, religion-based, or repressive Legislation. Individual liberty seems to be a concept with which Blacks are uneasy.  Controls being placed upon individuals by outside forces are things which they tend to view positively.  Black voters are why Gay Marriage was voted illegal here, by the widest margin in any state.  A third, I&rsquo;m told, of Mississippi&rsquo;s Blacks voted to KEEP our obviously Confederate State Flag.</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t find THAT being reported up in New York, either. </p>

		<p>I have an old white male friend who I&rsquo;ve known for over three decades, and he&rsquo;s been through 5 marriages and divorces and - he finally snagged himself an Asian woman.   In all fairness, I should point out that all those divorces pretty much cleaned him out financially - but, that is still no excuse - in my mind, for him to glob onto a Asian nurse, who&rsquo;s now become his financial security blanket. </p>
<p>Over the last few years, my refusal to roll over and meekly submit to this third world invasion and colonization of White, Western European civilization - and my refusal to temper or sugar coat any of my conversations with him on this topic - has resulted in our friendship being strained to the breaking point.</p>
<p>Frankly, as Rhett Butler said to Scarlet O&rsquo;Hara - &#8220;I don&rsquo;t give a damn.&#8221;    He made the decision to betray his own race, not I.  He made the decision to miscegenate and put himself into the awkward position of being unable to take his own race&rsquo;s side in this conflict, without worrying about &#8216;offending&rsquo; his non-white wife.    I had nothing to do with that decision, it was his and his alone.  </p>
<p>So, if he is conflicted or uncomfortable over his situation - I do not care.   I will NOT wrap my arms around the racial, ethnic and cultural dispossession of my own race of people - just so his &#8216;feelings&rsquo; or his wife&rsquo;s feelings won&rsquo;t be stressed out.</p>
<p>Race cards and racial intimidation tactics do not WORK ON THIS white man.  And, as every AR reader knows full well - every last one of these non-white racial groups have, somewhere in this world, a nation or combination of nations, where their race is the overwhelming majority, where their race of people are in full control of their nations and where their race is NOT being systematically dispossessed by their racial competitors and threatened with being subjugated to those racial competitors and eventually genocided into extinction. It is NOT &#8216;hate&rsquo; or &#8216;racist&rsquo; for White European people to demand the same ability to hang on to their dominance in their native homelands.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it is ethical to ban marriage between any man or woman.  How can you deny love?  Left to its natural course, most people, whites included, will marry their own anyway, and if you&rsquo;re scared of black/white pairings, even after so much propaganda, they&rsquo;re still very rare.</p>
<p>Also, how would you define &#8216;interracial?&rsquo;  Can an American of Polish ancestry marry someone who&rsquo;s mostly Scottish?  They sure look a lot different.  Can a Blond-haired Swedish-type woman marry an Italian-American?  Many Italians (southern) look no different than mestizo latinos.  How about a Spaniard marrying a Latvian? Both are technically European, but Spaniards look rather Arabish due to the Arabs being there for SEVEN centuries.  What of Russians and Ukrainians?  A lot of them look rather asiatic, even if they have blond hair.  Are they another race?</p>
<p>The point I want to make is, where do you draw the line?  You can&rsquo;t say &#8216;European background&rsquo; and define that as a race because Europeans themselves are so varied from pasty white with icy blond hair (nordic) to mongol-like with jet black hair (ukraine).  </p>
<p>Technically, Caucasians exist in many parts of north Africa, the Levant, the Caucasus and on over into Afghanistan and northern India.  (There&rsquo;s tons of Afghans, Pakistanis and Indians who are not dark skinned and who have blond/red/brown hair and very &#8216;white&rsquo; features.  Others are mestizos with the darker people of the south.)</p>
<p>I believe if a non-white person has a cultural outlook that subscribes to traditional white values and has a loyalty to white-created cultures and nations, then a little mixing can bring variety.  Plus, many non-Caucasian or partially Caucasian races also have a similar skin tone, similar cultural values and high IQs (like northeast Asians, central Asians, some middle easterners, etc)  And I&rsquo;m talking like a few percentage points of natural mixing here folks, so don&rsquo;t jump all over me.</p>
<p>What I would say is that marriages between Americans and foreigners need extra scrutiny because many are for a green card only.  If a person marries an American citizen and divorces them EVER, then they lose their green card and must be deported.</p>

		<p>I disagree with many of the comments on this article, mainly because I&rsquo;m more interested in people&rsquo;s lifestyle, values and attitudes. If you want to marry someone of a different race you should be able to - none of my business. Yes, perhaps it does upset the apple cart, but no need in fighting this issue- people will get together regardless of race. Always been that way. The only thing different is that it&rsquo;s just out in the open now.</p>
<p>I prefer white lifestyles and values, but if any non-whites agrees and want to be part of it, no problem. </p>
<p>Again, we can&rsquo;t do anything about this - people are attracted to other people regardless of race-always been that way. I&rsquo;d rather we spend our time and energy on keeping western culture alive and well, regardless how dark we become in a couple hundred years.<br>

		<p>In today&rsquo;s day and age, when (regrettably) about a quarter of whites and 70 percent of blacks have kids out of wedlock, banning interracial marriage would have not much of an effect on the birth of mulattoes. Banning inter-racial sex obviously would be a more effective tactic. And while I am strongly opposed to blacks and white having relations with each other, as someone else said on here I don&rsquo;t think the government should be prying into people personal lives. I read somewhere that MS has the lowest  percentage of multi racial people, so widespread societal disapproval must be quite adequate. I just wish that were the case up here in Yankeeland CT where brown kids with white parents is becoming depressingly common. </p>

		<p>The point that has been missed so far in all of the above comments is &#8220;Why is this question even being asked in a poll?&#8221;  </p>
<p><br>
The Answer to this question is very simple - the media outfit commissioning this poll is searching for ammunition to discredit Whites and Republicans as a group in order to eventually use this polling data to shame other, &#8220;softer&#8221; Whites into eventually voting for Barack Obama in 2012.   The very fact that Republicans in Mississippi would be asked such a question, and it&rsquo;s respondents&rsquo; tally reported, is just the opening salvo from the MSM media mining for &#8220;data&#8221; to use in assisting Obama&rsquo;s reelection, using this on one front of their effort in what I will describe as a &#8220;Shame&#8221; the Whites&#8221; strategy &hellip;.</p>
<p>Can you imagine even one day of the GOP Convention being covered by the MSM when this data&#8221; is not cited &hellip;..</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get creative &hellip;. How about a conservative group or media polling single Black Women on their feelings about Interracial Marriage?  Let&rsquo;s release that data. I bet the percentages willing to respond against it are greater than that of Mississippi Republicans &hellip;.</p>
<p>It is time for Conservatives to play this game and engage in full - and to quit bringing badmitton raqcuets to the life &amp; death sword fights that our elections have become !!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The point I want to make is, where do you draw the line? You can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;European background&rsquo; and define that as a race because Europeans themselves are so varied from pasty white with icy blond hair (nordic) to mongol-like with jet black hair (ukraine).&#8221;</p>
<p>As I understand it, physical anthropologists define Caucasians by skeletal structure in comparison to other races like Black Africans or East Asians.  Even though there is overlap (as there is overlap between different hominid species) the comparison as mostly accurate in its predictive value.  DNA demarcations which exist between different human races are even more accurate.</p>
<p>Many southern Italians and non-European Caucasians look signicantly different from the core Western and Northern European Whites but at least some interethnic unions between the two groups will produce children that look entirely White European due to the genetic similarity between the two regional groups.  This almost never happens in the case of interracial unions.  While not perfect, it is also not that difficult to define Caucasians against other racial groups for these reasons.</p>

		<p>Crossbreeding between two different races results in hybrid vigor, or heterosis, meaning that the product is genetically superior to either of the parents. If one truly wanted to increase the overall quality of the human race, one would advocate race mixing.

		<p>#27 And today&rsquo;s rate of white on black rape is so low as to be undetectable.  Does that make sense to you?  Has there ever been any proof that white men took sexual liberties with slaves, other than some black race hustler claiming it was so?</p>
<p>Which is more believable based on the observation of black behavior is every single instance you observe it&hellip;.that wealthy, land owning whites, who could have basically any decent, beautiful white woman they wanted, regularly forced themselves on (let&rsquo;s face it), UGLY black women&hellip;..or that the western world has always had a problem with black on white rape, since we first came into contact with them.</p>

<p>Secondly, just a couple weeks ago I saw an article in the New York Times about an interracial couple (White male/Black female.) In fact, they lived in Mississippi. The couple was a professional, upscale couple. In all honesty, I was very surprised to see this.</p>

In today&rsquo;s day and age, when (regrettably) about a quarter of whites and 70 percent of blacks have kids out of wedlock, banning interracial marriage would have not much of an effect on the birth of mulattoes. Banning inter-racial sex obviously would be a more effective tactic. And while I am strongly opposed to blacks and white having relations with each other, as someone else said on here I don&rsquo;t think the government should be prying into people personal lives. I read somewhere that MS has the lowest percentage of multi racial people, so widespread societal disapproval must be quite adequate. I just wish that were the case up here in Yankeeland CT where brown kids with white parents is becoming depressingly common.</p>
<p><br>
Yankett CT:</p>
<p>I hear you. Interestingly, I was watching a television program where they interviewed an interracial couple (White man/Black woman) who lived in a town named Westport, Connecticut. They were a very, very successful professional couple. Their home was absolutely BEAUTIFUL!</p>
<p>Aftrerward, I did some research about the town. According to USA TODAY and other sources, Westport, Connecticut is one of the wealthiest towns in the nation. It seems that miscegeantion is happening among the more affluent Whites and Blacks.  </p>

<p>The media covered the story in depth,  including describing explicit sex acts. The manner in which these men sexually expolited these women (most of the women were between 18-30) was disgraceful. A number of these men were outright perverts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think there should be laws against marriages between African-Americans and whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure a much smaller % object to other kinds of interracial marriage. </p>

<p>That is right more than half of those over 65 and those under 29 agree! I repeat 54% of people aged from 18 to 29 who answered the poll where opposed to it. </p>
<p>Internet? Experience form living with Blacks? Changing voting focuses for local republicans? Rebelling against parents? </p>

<p>I too am a  strong defender of personal liberty.  But some things exceed the limits of what is purely personal.</p>
<p>After long consideration, I have come to realize that marriage is a vital SOCIAL institution, not just a PERSONAL choice about whom you choose to  love or live with. It is not the same as what you will have for supper tonight.<br>
 <br>
The institution of marriage, down through ages and  around the world,  has existed among  all peoples and cultures.  There is is reason for this.  Marriage affects society and social stability, not just the individuals immediately involved.It affects the tribe or nation.  It affects us. </p>
<p>The institution of marriage is not a  purely PERSONAL matter because it involves the creation of the next generation of citizenry (or of the tribe)   &mdash;   the people our grandchildren  will live with,  intermarry with, and  who will vote for social policies that may be harmful to us and our interests. It is in the tribe&rsquo;s/nation&rsquo;s vital interest to know who will carry on the tribe.  Thus, unless you&rsquo;re living on an islolated island,  marriage involves all society, and  it concerns <i> ALL OF US.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s analagous to a neighbor who decides to build a garbage disposal plant in his back yard and tells you that it&rsquo;s none of your business what he does on his property. Sorry, libertarians, that shoddy  argument doesn&rsquo;t wash.   It&rsquo;s NOT just his own business! If it affects you, it most certainly IS your business too.  </p>
<p>Similarly,  inter-marriage ultimately affects all of us, and it is all of our business. We have every right to be concerned and to pass rules that regulate (and preserve)  what kind of people we want to be.</p>

<p>I fully agree with you.  Private matters should be sacrosanct, immune from the intrusion of government.</p>
<p>But as I stated in my post above, marriage is not PRIVATE.  It is a SOCIAL institution, and it concerns all of society.</p>
<p>If you want to shack up in private, there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent it; but don&rsquo;t apply for a marriage license and ask for society&rsquo;s blessing.</p>

<p>Let me make it clear that I do not  necessarily think this should be handled  within the province of the LAW, which would open an impossible can of worms.  But you can still give social disapproval to intermarriage. You certainly don&rsquo;t have to approve it.  The culture can  sometimes handle such matters better than the law, as something that just is not done.</p>

Ah, that explains a great deal.  The age groups seem to be indicating a trend I&rsquo;ve noticed myself.  The older folks I know tend to be amazingly &#8220;racist&#8221;, but their children(my parents generation) are some of the most &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; people I&rsquo;ve ever met.  Whereas THEIR children(my generation, early 20s) are, if not &#8220;racist&#8221;, then at the least are aware of race far more than their parents. </p>
<p>It also confirms what pretty much everyone on the planet already knew - no one wants anything to do with blacks no matter what their race is.  <br>

<p>Someone have data on that?</p>

		<p>I visit this site often and appreciate most of the views expressed. More often than not, I can say that I agree with these opinions to a large degree if not wholly. Although this article is broadly written to encompass myriad and countless combinations of marriages (afro-Asian, white-Latino, Jewish-Arabic), I&rsquo;m sure that the comments are perceived and directed at white/black relationships.  With that said, I have no interest in a relationship with a black person. I&rsquo;m not attracted to them and they typically have characteristics, morals and behavior that differ from mine. At the same time, I&rsquo;m not particularly attracted to Asians (many of whom tower over me in terms of intelligence and moral structure), and find Arabic women to be gorgeous although of a race that has been proven to be vile. <br>
That&rsquo;s me.<br>
I&rsquo;m offended that our government feels that it is their role in my life to dictate that I must wear a seatbelt, helmet or any other action (which doesn&rsquo;t affect others) that that is clearly a natural freedom. Not that many are not good ideas, it&rsquo;s my decision to make. I belong to me. Period. I can&rsquo;t help but find absurdity in a group of people who consider themselves &ldquo;conservative&rdquo;, who must appreciate the general concepts and freedoms of our constitution, in favor of government becoming so intrusive as to dictate the color of your partner&rsquo;s skin. That choice is up to you, not a bureaucracy. <br>

Strom Thurmond publicly condemned miscegenation, but he had an illegitimate mulatto daughter. </p>
<p>I am reminded of a black man who said, &ldquo;Southern whites say they do not want us to marry their daughters. We have married their illegitimate daughters for centuries.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The reason most American blacks have some white ancestry is because before the Civil War many white slave owners forced black slave women to have sex with them. After the Civil War, many white employers did the same with black female employees. </p>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
One highly speculative but stimulating chapter [of The 10,000 Year Explosion] considers the possibility that Neanderthals might have made crucial genetic contributions to Homo sapiens. There is no doubt that something important happened 30 to 40 thousand years ago. New tools, improved weapons, art, sculpture, and more efficient use of fire made big changes in what was still a Stone Age existence. These changes took place only in Eurasia  &mdash;  nowhere else  &mdash;  and Professors Cochran and Harpending are convinced they would not have come about without some important genetic change. <br>
 <br>
As it happens, this Stone Age flowering took place during the 10,000 years or so during which modern man and Neanderthals competed against each other in the same territory. Neanderthals are gone and we are not, so it is safe to assume Homo sapiens were superior  &mdash;  perhaps in intelligence, language, or resistance to disease. However, the authors believe there must have been genetic mixing with Neanderthals, and explain that even if just a few Neanderthal genes were useful to modern man, they would have spread through populations while the useless ones were eliminated. &ldquo;It is highly likely that out of some 20,000 genes, at least a few of theirs [Neanderthal&rsquo;s] were worth having,&rdquo; they write. <br>

The gene for sickle cell anemia gives one a partial immunity to malaria. The gene for Tays-Sacs disease gives one a higher IQ. <br>

In each case, if you have both genes you have the problem, but if you have one gene you get the benefit. That is how these genes are perpetuated. </p>

An attorney for the family of former U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina confirmed Monday that in 1925, when he was 22, Thurmond fathered a child with a black teenage housekeeper.</p>
<p>Thurmond, the longest-serving senator in U.S. history, died in June at age 100. His daughter&rsquo;s story was published Sunday by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Essie Mae Washington-Williams, a 78-year-old retired school teacher in Los Angeles, California, revealed her relationship to the former segregationist after decades of silence.<br>
http://articles.cnn.com/2003-12-15/us/thurmond..paternity_1_thurmond-family-essie-mae-washington-williams-carrie-butler?_s=PM:US <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
The media did not say anything because Strom Thurmond&rsquo;s daughter kept it quiet until her father died.<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
Essie Mae Washington-Williams claims to be the daughter of segregationist Strom Thurmond and his parent&rsquo;s black maid. Washington-Williams has documents showing that Thurmond supported her financially over the years. She&rsquo;s ready to take a DNA test to prove paternity.</p>

		<p>Do your research before you throw sickle cell into this conversation. I am from ALABAMA, white, with a black husband, and two &#8220;CROSSBREED&#8221; children. First of all, crossbreed is for animals, not humans, and second, a biracial child can carry the sickle cell gene but not be affected by the disease. Regardless of what Mississippians think, or anyone else for that matter, I have one of THE happiest marriages of anyone I know. People need to worry about THEMSELVES, and not the color of others&rsquo; children&hellip; Our nation is falling APART and THIS is what people focus on??? GET REAL!!! </p>

		<p>My guess is, that most of the CW aera mixed children resulted from thousands of footloose soldiers far enough from home liberating the black girls.  Works all the time.  I do not doubt that master/slave offspring occured. I doubt very much that it happened as often as clained. Not all white males of the time were total nincompoops with no care nor consideration of what happens to their own flesh and blood. Outspoken Grandma Fontaine from &#8220;Gone with the Wind&#8221;  made a sharp comment about just that. <br>
I personally know three white women (all Germans) married to black men with good solid marriages. That is not the norm. The boys of the first lady were a royal pain, but the girls of the other two were well behaved and good in school. I liked them, still, I am against mixed marriage. Preserve the races. I wish them all well. I would like for blacks and whites to develop and preserve their own culture, which would be true diversity. Like every family needs their own home, every race needs it&rsquo;s own country.  </p>

		<p>Hey guys, you just cannot now start campaigning or no interracial marriages.  Just think, the USA may have to apologise to the old guard of Apartheid South Africa as they wanted that to keep their white tribe clear of any &#8220;pollution&#8221; and so were ready to give up vast tracts of land in South Africa with rich farms, and mines so that the white tribe could live in peace while the black tribes governed themselves.  It would have never worked of course as history proves that the black tribes would soon have been starving and ready to fight to take over the white Africans thriving farms and mines, factories etc.  They would have lost as the white Africans were well able to defend themselves as they proved in Angola etc,but the World would not have stood by while so many black people were being slaughtered even if the WORLD did while 20 TO 30 000 Blacks were slaughtered by Mugabe in Zimbabwe in the 1980s.  There is nothing worse that Left-Wing and liberal hypocrisy.<br>
Now if the USA was to offer three million or more Green Cards to white South Africans, the USA would benefit greatly remembering that Apartheid South Africa generated 45% of the GDP of the whole of Africa while suffering under sanctions.</p>

<p>I would disagree. Miscegenation is mostly a phenomenon of the lower classes.</p>
<p>This is not true. While Whites of all economic classes have historically engaged in miscegenation with Blacks, the fact is that it was very commonplace among the upper classes. They were often more discreet about it - but it happened with this group of Whites most often.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there should be laws against marriages between African-Americans and whites?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure a much smaller % object to other kinds of interracial marriage. </p>

<p>That is right more than half of those over 65 and those under 29 agree! I repeat 54% of people aged from 18 to 29 who answered the poll where opposed to it. </p>
<p>Internet? Experience form living with Blacks? Changing voting focuses for local republicans? Rebelling against parents? </p>

Ah, that explains a great deal. The age groups seem to be indicating a trend I&rsquo;ve noticed myself. The older folks I know tend to be amazingly &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, but their children(my parents generation) are some of the most &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; people I&rsquo;ve ever met. Whereas THEIR children(my generation, early 20s) are, if not &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, then at the least are aware of race far more than their parents. </p>
<p>It also confirms what pretty much everyone on the planet already knew - no one wants anything to do with blacks no matter what their race is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
To posters 39 and 51:</p>
<p>While these polls may make you feel some sigh of relief, the fact is that these polls are not always accurate. First of all, they may interview only a small sample of people. Moreover,  in many cases, they target the areas of people they are interested in polling if they are looking for a certain outcome. By this I mean, if they want the results of a survey to lean left of center, they will contact predominately, Black, Hispanic, urban liberal White areas. </p>
<p>On the contrary, if they are looking for results that will result in right of center advantages, they will target, more southern, small town, rural areas, especially town whwerer there are a large number of conservative, fundamentalist christians.  Young people in this region would be more inclined to be conservative in nature.</p>
<p>On the point of younger people being more racially conscious than their parents. Possible, but HIGHLY UNLIKELY. At least this is not what I see where I live.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Strom Thurmond did not CHOOSE to have an illegitimate mulatto daughter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he had bitter regrets about this. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it was regarded as a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>Mistakes do happen.  This was a youthful indiscretion, as a teenager, no doubt  regretted for the rest of his life.  But it must be said that he did have the decency to  (privately) provide for her and support her and give her a good life.  Unlike  many black fathers,  he was not a hit-and-run  &#8220;baby daddy&#8221;!</p>
<p>PS.  Why do some trolls here keep bringing up Strom Thurmond, on every thread such as this?  They never let it rest.</p>

The fact is that the poster was correct. It is inappropriate for anyone to refer to any group of women as ugly regardless of race. Secondly that you would make such an ignorant comment saying all Black women are ugly leaves the impression that you are most likely a troll from a far right wing website that has probably been closed dwon due to the extreme ignorance of posters like you.   </p>

		<p>As a Jefferson descendant, I feel bound to comment on the reference to Thomas Jefferson, asserting that he &#8221;engaged in miscegenation.&rsquo; The person who claims this is engaging in gossip and slander. It has not been proven that Jefferson did so; it was originally a smear by one of Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s political enemies, and there has been no DNA proof showing Thomas Jefferson to be the father of the Hemings descendants. Once more, I will point readers who are interested in the truth here<br>
http://www.ashbrook.org/articles/mayer-hemings.html</p>
<p>There are many other articles which may be found, which question the slander against Jefferson. Google is our friend.<br>
This discussion, in which some are eager to spread old canards based on leering innuendo about &#8216;rape&rsquo; of female slaves, really does show the important distinction between &#8216;race realism&rsquo; and race loyalism, the latter being in short supply, it seems.<br>
By the way, though, it is possible to be a realist AND a loyalist where one&rsquo;s folk is concerned.</p>

		<p>I am not in favor of interracial marriage, but the one I find most disturbing is the one between blacks and whites. First, black men are not marrying white women because there are not enough black women available.On the contrary, nearly 70% of all black women in the U.S. are single. So why do black men choose white women when all these &#8220;sistas&#8221; are single? Second, black men are notorious for walking out on women, especially ones they have had kids with. Look at the stats, most black kids are raised by a single parent, usually the mother. White women fail to realize this when the get involved with a black man. There is a good chance he will leave her. You see so many white women walking around with mixed race kids and the black father is no where to be seen. Obama&rsquo;s black father walked out on him. The actress Halle Barry had a black father who walked out on the family. Third, black people like to play the race card and blame&#8221;whitey&#8221; for all there problems. That the white establishment is keeping them from getting ahead, that America is a white dominated racist country. If all this is true, then why marry into white society? And blacks like to put all this emphasis on black pride, black heritage, culture, MLK day, call themselves &#8220;brutha and sistas&#8221; and then want a white spouse and a home in the white suburbs. And how do you raise a black/white child? In the white culture or black culture? These kids consider themselves to be black. But they can grow up confused and often alienated. Parents of black/white unions never stop to think what their kids might have to endure. In general I find blacks, especially black men, hypocrites when it comes to wanting to marry a white person. The idea that so many black men just happen to&#8221;fall in love&#8221; with a white women is hard to believe. </p>

<p>&#8220;I have never heard so many ignorant comments in ALL MY LIFE&hellip; my biracial children are advanced in school, and i am a stay at home mom to my youngest child, because my BLACK husband works and provides a stable home and enough finances so that I don&rsquo;t have to work. While our economy was failing last year, he made more money than he ever had, and while most people were losing their homes in the real estate crash, WE bought a new one. This whole conversation is IGNORANT.. &#8220;</p>
<p>YOU are proof that the plan is working fine.  You were bought.  Tell us that your black husband is NOT a government employer, and I will be amazed.  Giving non-white men jobs guarantees that slummy white women like you will marry them and kill the white man.  We&rsquo;re NOT ignorant, we know what it&rsquo;s all about, DO YOU?</p>

		<p>There are laws that criminalize drugs and sex with under age children. These laws are infringing on certain people&rsquo;s rights but they serve to protect society as a whole.  How are anti-miscegenation laws any different? I don&rsquo;t know how effective they would be since I wonder how many of those mixed race children are born out of wedlock but still it&rsquo;s a start.   <br>

Whenever this subject arises there are always those white do-gooders who stumbl;e forward with an exception that is given for the purpose of misconstruing it as the rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares whether Strom THurmond fathered a brat by a black? At worst he had a weak moment, but undoubtedly he did not believe in race mixing. But what if he did? What has that to do with the issue of miscegenation in general? Let me help a bit: Answer: NOTHING.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too, for the misguided soul who thinks the hybrid pairing of people results in a superior breed, better comne up with something better than just an unsupported opinion. Remember, many of us live in the real world where we KNOW from every day experience mulattos are not smart people generally and it is obviously due to the low intellect of the black in the pairing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The topic is miscegenation. Are you for it or not, dummies? It has nothing to do with Strom Thurmond or his views on the subject. </p>
<p>&#8220;And to the ignorant black author who thinks white employers lusted after black women, I might suggest he take a REAL good look at black women who are the norm, if he can view the matter objectively. Does he really believe the average white guy would have sex with these horribly unattractive people?</p>
<p>&#8220;I shiver at the thought, and I&rsquo;m in my thirties. I would have felt the same way in my teens and twenties.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Such a misinformed, ignorant post demonstrates that you are in DENIAL.]</p>
<p>Your opinion on anything is worthless, because it is just that:  An opinion with absolutely no counter argument against specific points that were outlined, which has absolutely nothing to do with &#8220;denial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your contributions to this entire topic, unfortunately, are not only steeped in ignorance you can&rsquo;t even address the proper issues in an intelligent manner.  You made a general statement based on absolutely nothing, as if the mere utterance of it is all the examples necessary to prove a point.</p>
<p>Anubody that offers an isolated incident concerning Thurmond in response to a topic that has to do with being for or against miscegenation isn&rsquo;t bright enough to understand much of anything.</p>

		<p>Most American Blacks are hybrids, maybe 25 or 30 percent White on average?  How can anyone look at them and imagine that hybrids are generally superior to their parents?  Better than the average African, for sure, but far short of the average White.<br>
     <br>
And that, btw, does a lot to explain where the White genes in most Blacks come from.  Ask yourself, what&rsquo;s more likely: a White man raping a Black, or a Black slave offering herself to a White?  Slave women were very willing to breed up, offering themselves to a White man in order to improve their offspring.  Those White men were most probably ones with direct contact with the slaves, overseers, rather than owners. <br>
    <br>
Which brings up the article that broke the Jefferson-Hemings story back in the 1990s, in Nature, a leading British science magazine.  The story did not support the conclusion, and even the conclusion did not support the headline.  Throughly dishonest propaganda.  Perhaps you can still find it online.</p>
<p>John Howard Griffin was a fraud and a fool.  Can anyone actually believe that he could, by simply darkening his skin, pass for Black?    </p>
<p>As for interracial breeding, I think that, in a free nation like ours, it should be as legal as poisoning a reservoir.  I find it hard to see how AmRen posters can be unaware that all those precious Constitutional liberties will disappear along with the White majority.  The Constitution is not a suicide pact, as Justice Holmes said.  </p>

As a Jefferson descendant, I feel bound to comment on the reference to Thomas Jefferson, asserting that he &rdquo;engaged in miscegenation.&rsquo; The person who claims this is engaging in gossip and slander. It has not been proven that Jefferson did so; it was originally a smear by one of Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s political enemies, and there has been no DNA proof showing Thomas Jefferson to be the father of the Hemings descendants. Once more, I will point readers who are interested in the truth here<br>

In all due respect to you, the fact is that your relative Mr. Jefferson, a founding father was a miscegenationist. Period.</p>

<p>Then why have you not provided any proof? Emphatic bare assertions prove nothing. All that has been proven is that some Jefferson male was the father of one, and only one Hemmings infant (it was the youngest of the brood); the olders members have exactly no Jefferson DNA, and the culprit in the last instance could have been any of over a dozen males.</p>
<p>In typical black fashion, descendants of the discredited Hemmings children continue to press their claim, and made utter fools of themselves some years back at Monticello by crashing the party.</p>

There have been a number of studies conducted, most famously the one at Oxford University in 1996 that did in fact, confirm that Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings did have a sexual relationship and children. The majority of scholars on this topic pretty much agree that this did take place.</p>
<p><br>
In regards to the female who &#8220;pinned you against the wall&#8221; I can safely say that I have seen many White males aggessively pursue Black women as well. In the military, on college campuses, dance clubs etc&hellip; Trust me, it is a two way street. </p>

<p>A miscegenationist is one who believes in race mixing.  TJ never believed in race mixing.  What part of that do you find difficult to understand?  Don&rsquo;t you realize how foolish your statement is?  Even if TJ had a black child it doesn&rsquo;t logically follow he believes in race mixing.  The worst he could possibly be is extremely careless or a hypocrite.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re no more than an anti-white hater that comes on the site in order to sow dissension or make unsupported comments based on absolutely nothing but your own erroneous opinions, and, I wish we would not be bothered by those who are not bright enough to add anything logical or truthful to the debate.</p>
<p>But allow me let you in on a little secret:  It doesn&rsquo;t matter one iota what the founding fathers believed regarding race, because WE DON&rsquo;T LIKE RACE-MIXING&hellip;&hellip;.like millions of other whites&hellip;.. and there&rsquo;s nothing you can bring up that will change anyone&rsquo;s mind but a fool.<br>

<p>Exactly right again. Ive read that some overseers were paid to &#8220;improve the stock&#8221; by lightening up the first generation. No doubt a good slug of whiskey helped.   It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that a wealthy, refined plantation owner would want anything to do with an unwashed, smelly black slave out of the fields.   That&rsquo;s pure Hollywood fantasy.  Yes, there were brothels in New Orleans that offered high class octroons. But the French and Spanish in Louisiana  had more relaxed ideas about sexual morals than the Anglos. Even so, they may have kept a &#8220;colored&#8221; mistress on the side, but they wouldn&rsquo;t consider marrying her.</p>

		<p>A sensible treatment of the mishandling and willful misinterpretation of the Jefferson-Hemings DNA study,largely on the part of black &#8220;scholar&#8221; Annette Gordon-Reed:</p>
<p><a href="http://hnn.us/articles/89499.html" rel="nofollow">http://hnn.us/articles/89499.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It all started when a popular British science journal found itself in a rush to get an article into print.  The title was simply too good for Nature to pass up: &#8220;Jefferson Fathered Slave&rsquo;s Last Child&#8221; [November 5, 1998, p.27-28].  No matter that the shell-shocked authors of the DNA study soon complained on the journal&rsquo;s own pages that &#8220;The title assigned to our study was misleading&#8221; and stated that &#8220;Thomas Jefferson can neither be definitely excluded nor solely implicated in the paternity of illegitimate children with his slave Sally Hemings&#8221; [January 7, 1999, p.32].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it mattered not a whit that the journal Science received an admission from Nature that &#8220;the whole thing really was rushed through&#8221; after they learned that the &#8220;popular press&#8221; had gotten wind of the study.  Nature was reeling from criticism by the scientific community   &mdash;  - almost none of which was reported in the mass media   &mdash;  - and tried to make the best of a bad situation by not dodging questions and providing forthright, if embarrassing, answers to questions.  A spokesman for Nature sheepishly explained that the misleading headline and problems with an accompanying commentary (co-written by Joseph J. Ellis who was later suspended by Mt. Holyoke College over another matter) &#8220;probably would have gotten straightened out if there had not been this frantic rush to beat the leaks&#8221; [&ldquo;Which Jefferson was the Father?&rdquo; January 8, 1999, p.153].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The editors at another journal, Natural Science, were unimpressed with Nature&rsquo;s excuses and particularly scathing in their editorial assessment, &#8221; &lsquo;Jefferson Fathered Slave&rsquo;s Last Child&rsquo;   &mdash;   Journal Article Raises a Question of Credibility&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Rather than accept the authority of the editor of Nature or some other journal in the determination of scientific truth, both the media and the public at large should be skeptical about all scientific claims until they have been evaluated, not only by peer-reviewed journals, but also in the open forum of scientific and public discussion. In particular, the public should be skeptical about scientific claims that support political interests.  When such claims lack intrinsic scientific significance (as in the case of those made in the [Dr. Eugene A.] Foster paper), their publication in a scientific journal should be recognized for what it is: an abuse of the scientific press. [March 19, 1999]&#8221; </p>

<p>Forty years ago there was nothing &#8220;extremist&#8221; about this and I would dare say public opinion is on our side no matter what contrived polls might indicate.  The only people this is regulating are those who want to miscegenate and those who want to promote it.  It doesn&rsquo;t interfere with anyone else&rsquo;s rights in the same way child pornography laws don&rsquo;t regulate the lives of most people.   </p>
