<h1>Black Man Charged with Sending KKK Threats in Illinois</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KMOV (St. Louis), April 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 28-year-old African-American man has been charged with sending threats signed from the KKK to officials in the southern Illinois community of O&rsquo;Fallon.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say a grand jury has indicted Justin Lamar Kidd of two counts of maliciously conveying a false threat.</p>
<p>Officials allege Kidd is behind two November 2006 letters to the O&rsquo;Fallon Police Department and City Hall. Both are signed &#8220;KKK warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The police letter warns that an apartment complex would be burned down if &#8220;all the blacks&#8221; aren&rsquo;t removed.</p>
<p>The City Hall letter threatens to burn down the homes of black residents if they&rsquo;re allowed to stay.</p>

		<p>I pride myself on having a very long memory.  What I find strange is that when this incident actually happened, almost four and a half years ago, the local media really didn&rsquo;t mention it.  I don&rsquo;t think they did, because I searched the archives of my own blog for any post I might have made about it, and found nothing from November 2006 about K-threats in O&rsquo;Fallon.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Fallon, Illinois is a white flight town over in the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, mainly whites who long ago fled East St. Louis and are now fleeing rapidly &#8220;diversifying&#8221; Belleville.  Until recently, the O&rsquo;Fallon P.D. (which is mentioned in this article) had no black cops, but the NAACP drug them into court and the Federal courts made them hire a few blacks.</p>

		<p>I wonder how they caught this guy.  Of course the cops probably figured it was a black who threatened to &#8220;burn the hole complex&#8221;.  O&rsquo;Fallon is about 11% black, so maybe they just went to the local ghetto and asked around.  Or they could have put out a Crimestoppers reward.  Then his own mama would have turned him in.</p>

		<p>No doubt this was seen by the locals as a &#8216;horrifying incident&rsquo; until the truth came out. Now there will be just as many calls for action and &#8216;tolerance&rsquo;, because it Could have happened and affords us another opportunity highlight &#8216;hate&rsquo; in our communities. By which they mean whites and not any people of color, including this &#8216;well meaning but confused&rsquo; youngster.</p>

		<p>This hoax reminds me of the White female here in Des Moines who put out a police report claiming that a twentysomething Black male had physically atttacked and attempted to run over her two young children.</p>
<p>The truth was that she had been drinking heavily and severely phyisically beat her children. She was prosecuted and the children are currently staying with relatives.</p>

The MSM does an horrendous job of critical thinking and follow through.</p>
<p>These &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; stories pop up and the media seems to swallow them hook, line, and sinker without asking pertinent questions. Whether it&rsquo;s ignorance, negligence, or deliberate is the question.</p>
<p>Until you know who committed the alleged crime, you can&rsquo;t know the motive.</p>
<p>Of course, the damage is done with the first headline. &#8220;HATE CRIME COMMITTED&#8221;. By the time it&rsquo;s revealed as a hoax, it not likely to get any coverage. In the minds of the majority who read the original story, they continue to believe a lie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point isn&rsquo;t it? Keep the term &#8220;HATE CRIME&#8221; in the public mind without critical follow up.<br>

		<p>@2 Ole White Lady,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
I wonder how they caught this guy. Of course the cops probably figured it was a black who threatened to &ldquo;burn the hole complex&rdquo;. O&rsquo;Fallon is about 11% black, so maybe they just went to the local ghetto and asked around. Or they could have put out a Crimestoppers reward. Then his own mama would have turned him in.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Identifying a person from their writing can be done by the type of language and writing style they use (gender, age, education levels and ethnic background).  By the chemical signature of sweat and skin oils left on the paper.  By the size and distribution of print patterns (heavy labor, big hands, damaged finger pads, even gloved&hellip;).  And by forensic as well as pattern analysis of the postal process (envelopes and stamps have batch-coded mucilage chemistry and stamps are now printed with microdot serials on the tear edges according to some which allows them to be tracked down to the store-delivery) as a function of pickup locations and dates.  Criminals are often &#8216;geographically lazy&rsquo; in covering up the logistics of their pre-crime activities, especially if they don&rsquo;t perceive the act of mailing a threat as a crime itself.</p>
<p>If the letter is delivered directly to either a post office or a federally protected building to avoid a postal crime, actual sensor surveillance of the facility itself is also a high order probability.</p>
<p>Just looking at the Halloween image of a fat man standing on a corner in a K costume tells you that it&rsquo;s probably not a white crime.  Because whites are terrified of being publicly excoriated as &#8216;fringists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And given this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Kidd was arrested Wednesday and is being held in federal custody.<br>
A judge has ordered a mental evaluation for him. It wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear who he&rsquo;s being represented by.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/qN7Pc</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even possible that that is the overall purpose of this &#8216;when did that happen?&rsquo; event.  To create a sense of relief that it -is not- a white crime is itself a shaping psychology when there is no evidence of a prior criminal event at all.</p>
<p>And the black man is not being actively represented as a criminal trying to frame an organization for an imminent terrorist attack (because the K is itself considered beyond the pale of civil protections).</p>
<p>So much as a &#8216;victim of his own psychosis&rsquo; in thinking that he was white enough to be a bigot.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read and listened to and watched the other local MSM coverage of this story.  There seems to be a disappointing meme, a common theme, throughout all those stories, which is perhaps not the media&rsquo;s fault (though they&rsquo;re happy to play along), but more the fault of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office over on the East Side   &mdash;   The theme seems to be that Mr. Kidd&rsquo;s crime was one of filing a false report to law enforcement.  Which it was, but saying that this is all a matter of a &#8220;false&#8221; statement to law enforcement is like saying the Pope is a Catholic priest.  The U.S. Attorneys seem to want to ignore or downplay the racial hoax aspect here.</p>

		<p>Here is a noose story from a black family in a Cleveland, Ohio suburb.  <a href="https://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/09/fairview_park_black_family_fin.html" rel="nofollow">The Plain Dealer</a> reported that on Monday, September 07, 2009, &ldquo;Fredrick Howery said his two children were in the front yard of their home in the 3900 block of West 223rd Street when they came across the rope and a note that told the family to &lsquo;get the [expletive] out of Fairview Park.&rsquo; It was signed, &lsquo;Aryan Knights of Fairview Park.&rsquo; The rope was 3 feet long.&rdquo;<br>
<p><br>
&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s disconcerting, especially with my children playing in the front yard,&#8221; Howery said Monday. &#8220;It is something that has to be addressed by the community. We&rsquo;re not the only black family in this neighborhood.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<p><br>
Here is the dead giveaway that it is a hoax, &ldquo;Howery said his family had about 20 to 25 relatives over Saturday for a picnic. People left about 9:30 p.m. The next day, Howery asked his two girls to search the front yard for a relative&rsquo;s keys.&rdquo;<br>
<p><br>
What black party has ever broken up at 9:30p.m.?  And how come the relative didn&rsquo;t need the keys to get home?<br>
<p><br>
No one has ever been arrested or charged.<br>

		<p>Blacks are just running out of real issues to get stirred up about. Victimization has paid off in the past and it must be hard for them to wean off the gravy train.</p>
