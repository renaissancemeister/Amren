<p>Fiscal starvation?  Probably.  Regime change?  Just voting for a Republican President won&rsquo;t work, because all of the big name contenders are Lincoln/Reagan idolators and egalitarians, so they&rsquo;re useless in this cause.  If you truly believe racial equality, then nothing but deliberate white racism can be the cause of &#8220;health inequalities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The afrovoodoo blacks have a plan for environmental equality-  wipe out all Whites Only genes.   Once all races are mixed with Whitey genes, then Whiteys will be gone, and the non whites will have stolen our creative genius.  We lose, they win.</p>
<p>You can never lift a black high enough to compensate you for how far you fall in the effort. Associating with blacks always raises them and always pulls you down.</p>
<p>We gave them our English language for free, and they use it against us to shame gullible, compassionate Whiteys into voting for Integration and Civil Rights, and now for Transformative Diversity Leadership.</p>
<p>They want to change the environment by eliminating competition from a smarter and weaker foe.  They probably secretly howl at how easy Whiteys  give up their God-ordained privileges.</p>
<p>We are fools.  What hope do you have for our White Humanity?  We always give away our countries to the lowest of sub ethnic populations.   We had our chance, and we don&rsquo;t deserve another&hellip;</p>
<p>Even the angels cry at our tragedy.  We wanted to be good, but we did bad in the process, and now we suffer, and will eternally.  <br>

		<p>Trying to close gaps regarding the differences among the races is the work of fools.  And, it is these same fools who think  there lies some unjust reason for blacks lagging behind everybody else and that the solution to the problem is to give blacks more privileges and to increase funding, making certain the money goes ONLY to blacks and black things.  It is black arrogance, coupled with a refusal to admit to shortcomings, that hold blacks in a perpetual state of denial.  Of course the white liberals are as they are, because of rank stupidity.  </p>
<p>The whining from the black sector is in itself amazing.  If whites re-elect this anti-white regime for one one more term, they&rsquo;ll sink us all.</p>

		<p>Blacks in America are healthier, richer, better educated, live longer, etc. than blacks anywhere else in the world.  The United States is an example of how a majority-white society with a rule of law and moral conscious can make lives better for the minorities that live within their borders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, blacks, hispanics, etc. believe fewer whites will give them a better life?  Hmm, few whites live in Mexico, Haiti, S. Africa, El Salvador, and Jamaica.  How about just emigrating?</p>

		<p>It always makes me laugh when I hear that minorities do not have &#8220;equal access to healthcare&#8221;. To me it sounds like there are guards at the doors of hospitals and clinics turning any minorities away. The real issue is that low IQ blacks (Hispanics tend to use free healthcare to its fullest) don&rsquo;t understand most medical treatment, tend to be afraid of it and do not seek any medical attention until it is far later than other races would. In order to narrow this gap they would have to literally force people at gunpoint to go to the doctor and then to follow the medical advice once they went to the appointment. </p>

		<p>Yes, they have statistics for everything at Obamacentral no doubt. Especially considering his new health care plan. There&rsquo;s no racial gap that&rsquo;s not closely study by the bureaucrats and up and coming students at our universities. The absence of one statistic puzzles me, however. Over 600,000 Americans had died of AIDS. Why do we never, ever, learn the race of those who&rsquo;ve died?</p>

In order to narrow this gap they would have to literally force people at gunpoint to go to the doctor and then to follow the medical advice once they went to the appointment. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>In England, this is called socialized medicine.  It always confused me how it was so much better because you are diagnosed dead as much as ill since you can never get prompt treatment for what is _regular checkup_ diagnosed.  But hey, I&rsquo;m easily distracted&hellip;</p>
<p>Which brings me to my main point-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The rest of the story of the development of high-IQ children is told by a major longitudinal study launched in 1921 by Lewis Terman, developer of the Stanford Binet test (Holahan &amp; Sears, 1995; Terman, 1954; Oden 1968)/  The participants were more than 1500 California Scholchildren nominated by their teachers as gifted and who had IQs of 140 or higher.  It soon became apparent that these high-IQ children (who came to be called /Termites/) were exception in many other ways.  For example, they had weighed more at birth and had learned to walk and talk sooner than most toddlers.  They reached puberty somewhat earlier than average and and had better-than-average-health.  Their teachers rated them better adjusted and more morally mature than their less intelligent peers.  And, although they were no more popular than their classmates, they were quick to take on leadership responsibilities.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/j4cl1" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/j4cl1</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the genes.  It&rsquo;s ALWAYS IN THE GENES.  You want IQ?  You get health and -health consciousness- with it.  You get longer life (SSADH gene = 85-100)-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
It seems there may be some truth in the old adage about being old and wise, for a new study has revealed that brainy people are likely to live 15 years longer than others. </p>
<p>Researchers at Calabria University in Italy have found that longevity is because the brains of intelligent people age more slowly – thanks to the very gene SSADH which makes them clever actually.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/BOssl" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/BOssl</a></p>
<p>And you get the social networking advantages of _displayed behavior_ which &#8216;leadership tasks&rsquo; provide, so that you age more gracefully into positions where your wisdom buys you power and respect.</p>
<p>We are treating the plague of black stupidity, with aspirin, after the victims have already shown the bubo like symptoms of criminality and low social achievement index that correlates with the disease.  And the world laughs at us.  The Arabs.  The Chinese.  The Japanese.  Even the Europeans where they can afford to in places like Finland and Iceland.</p>
<p>How smart does that make us?!?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like blacks.  But I recognize the fact that the best way to get American blacks to go mouse the elephant in their homelands is to look at the genetic roots of IQ and apply the lessons learned to all races so that they can stand on their own.</p>
<p>37 million blacks with a mean IQ of 87 = Gaussian distribution of 2.5% in the range of IQ 115 or higher as upper middle class candidates for college training.  That&rsquo;s 900,000 or so.</p>
<p>They have _no hope_ of ever becoming self sufficient with those numbers when we can generate 16% of a 103 IQ baseline population (at 115 IQ) or some 30 million gifteds from 180 million whites, _and we can barely manage_.</p>
<p>WAKE UP folks.  It&rsquo;s in the genes.  If we don&rsquo;t stop whistling past Hitler&rsquo;s grave, we are all doomed to extinction under a never ending flood of ethnic idiots.  All because we refuse to acknowledge that not only are we better but there is a reason we are.</p>

		<p>Tell them to stop smoking, drinking, using drugs, using violence against one another, eat a better diet more commensurate for their metabolism, go to the doctor for yearly check ups, get a better mental attitude and stop blaming the Tuskegee &#8220;Experiment&#8221; [study] for what ails them.

<p>So how does this jibe with the well known facts that blacks with their average IQs of 85 walk at an average of 10 rather than 12 months and reach puberty about 3 years earlier than Whites and after six months old tend to be taller and heavier than Whites?</p>
<p>A lot of black babies can actually walk unassisted without holding on to anything the length of a room at 8 months.  This is really early.</p>

<p>Interesting.  My Mother is extremely mentally and physically healthy at 97.  Her IQ was tested in back in grade school.  It&rsquo;s 133.<br>

		<p>The real purpose of this is affirmative action in health care.<br>
Give all avaliable health care to non Whites and severely restrict health care for Whites.</p>
<p>Anyone remember when affirmative action was supposed to be just a quota system?  A 12 percent black quota for government jobs?  Look at any government agency anywhere in the country, about 95 percent non White, including immigrants who speak no English at all.</p>
<p>This is part of the plans for genocide of the White race; genocide through denial of medical care.</p>
