			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Chatterton Williams, NY Daily News, April 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the 1960 essay, &#8220;Fifth Avenue, Uptown,&#8221; James Baldwin noted a form of greeting he would often hear in Harlem: &#8220;&#8216;How&rsquo;re you making it?&rsquo; one may ask,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;&#8216;Oh, I&rsquo;m TV-ing it,&rsquo;&#8221; would be the reply.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fast-forward 50 years and a whole lot of socioeconomic progress in black America. Nielsen, the ratings agency, has released its latest State of the Media report showing national television-watching trends in the year 2010. The numbers are alarming. Blacks ages 18 to 49, the data show, have been TV-ing it at a record-setting pace  &mdash;  on average clocking in a whopping 7 hours and 12 minutes a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more than two hours per day above the national rate of 5 hours and 11 minutes, and just shy of four hours per day more than the amount of TV watched by Asian-Americans, who clock in a relatively meager 3 hours and 14 minutes a day.</p>
<p>Do the math, and African-American television consumption adds up to more than 50 hours of television every single week and more than 200 hours each month. To put that kind of TV-watching investment in perspective, in order to make bonus, corporate attorneys are expected to bill a measly 170 hours in a month. That means that the typical African-American is on partner track &hellip; in television time!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The national African-American high school graduation rate hovers somewhere around 50%. What if for two of those seven hours of daily television consumption, more black parents chose to read stories to their children at night? What if for two of those seven hours per day, more African-American students chose to study vocabulary or work through extra arithmetic problems?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep it all the way real  &mdash;  we can&rsquo;t afford to be TV-ing it in 2011.</p>

		<p>The best thing that you can do for your children is cancel cable.  Instead, have &#8220;Family Nights&#8221; where you watch wholesome rented movies together as a family.   Your children will remember those wonderful times for the rest of their lives.  </p>
<p>We tossed out the One-Eyed Bolshevik when our kids were young.  The result?  They played outside, read books, invented games, and socialized with friends.  Both got straigt &ldquo;A&rsquo;s&rdquo; in high school, and both are now at top universities.   <br>

		<p>Blacks spend a fifth of their entire lives watching television, and a whole lot of what they watch is anti white fictional  depictions of Whites doing all kinds of bad things to Blacks. This might explain why there are so many hate crimes being done by them against us.  Prime time television produces far more black bigots than any black hate groups.</p>

		<p>The parent(s) can&rsquo;t read stories to their children, because the parent(s) can&rsquo;t read! They are now three or four generations deep in illiteracy. There is no reason for them to read, or ever learn to read.</p>
<p>I once sent home a photocopy of a &#8220;composition&#8221; done by a sixth grade girl (with a note saying I wanted to talk to the parent). The &#8220;composition&#8221; was what psychologists called &#8220;word salad&#8221;  &mdash;  just a lot of unrelated words strung together, making absolutely no sense. The girl came into school a few days later and said how proud her mother was that she had written so much. </p>

		<p>Judging from the previous two articles I just read on this site (McDonalds beating and the poor old Vietnamese man) the more time these people spend in front of the TV the better!<br>
Not only that, as someone that watches no TV (just the odd show I&rsquo;ll have on DVD or video) I&rsquo;ve always thought that anyone who can sit there for hours on end and watch TV without even thinking twice must be a complete imbecile.</p>

		<p>Television appeals to the brainless idiot in all of us.  Thus it is the perfect medium for black people.  I prefer not to appease my inner brainless idiot so I don&rsquo;t own a television.</p>
<p>Aside from being stupid, television is a relentless organ of propaganda.  I would no more want a television in my living room than I&rsquo;d want a sewer pipe emptying into it.  It&rsquo;s the same thing, in fact.</p>

		<p>I used to watch alot of TV myself until the programming deteriorated and the social engineering became more noticeable.  That was about 10 years ago.  Perhaps if they changed the programming to something less palatable for blacks they&rsquo;d stop watching.  Of course, Hollywood would never do that.</p>

		<p>Blacks and other minorities are reaping benefits because white people have been &#8220;TV-ing&#8221; it during that same fifty years. Whites are victims of propaganda while &#8220;TV-ing&#8221; it. The TV has been pouring an idiotic notion of equality,guilt,self hatred and evil white racism into the minds of gullible whites.The TV has been hypnotically telling whites for decades how evil they are and how they must make way for a more diverse nation of happy go lucky,less violent morally superior and highly intelligent non white population. I don&rsquo;t think white people would be in the mess they are in today without the results of &#8220;TV-ing&#8221; it.From the fairy tail diversity of sesame street and Dora the explorer as children then to the sitcom comedies like All in the family TV-ing it has had a profound effect on the minds of white people.That profound effect has been mostly a negative one.TV can be a true weapon of mass destruction.</p>

<p><br>
Whites are the majority population in the US and so their TV viewing is most likely around the national average of 5 hours. If it were not, then the national average would be skewed towards one of the extremes (7 or 3). </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to measure my TV watching. I&rsquo;m usually at the computer while &#8220;watching&#8221; TV, reading the latest news (especially Amren; the TV was on while I read this article).</p>
<p>If you simply count the number of hours the TV is ON in our house, then we &#8220;watch&#8221; tons of TV. Sometimes, I even read or converse with my spouse while the TV is turned down low. Of late, I&rsquo;ve found it harder and harder to just watch TV singlemindedly.</p>

		<p>Watching television requires little to no mental exertion. When you have a very low IQ, simple tasks can require you to spend much more energy figuring out, doing without error, etc. than people of normal intelligence. In other words, if you are very dumb the world is a very confusing place and being engaged in life&rsquo;s activities can be very difficult. TV doesn&rsquo;t require anything from its viewers. This is why blacks (and to be fair, low IQ individuals of every race) flock to the television screen, in order to escape from the complexities of reality, and relax their overstrained minds. I rarely watch TV, but when I do it&rsquo;s only Fox News, CNN, Bloomberg, etc. because I am a smarty pants.</p>

		<p>To #14:</p>
<p>Beware! TV can be more influential when you are not focusing on it. The expert psychologists, who design the commercials, assume their subjects&rsquo; conscious is not focused on the commercial. This allows them direct access to the subjects&rsquo; subconscious. The same is true for propaganda inserted into the &#8220;content&#8221; of the program.</p>

		<p>Poster #5 asked about how much TV whites watched on average per day.</p>
<p>I had the same question, so did some investigation and was able to find the study online.  Whites watch about 5 hours of TV per day, which is about the same amount that Hispanics watch.</p>

<p><i>Where are these education majors now, that the black community needs tutoring?</i></p>
<p>Safely and securely ensconced, drawing $100K+ salaries, in the administrative offices of school districts, colleges and universities everywhere, far away from black children and blacks in general, driving BMWs, Jaguars, and Mercedes, living in White neighborhoods, knowing that they cannot ever be fired or demoted.</p>
<p>Many can&rsquo;t pass the required easy tests and are listed as &#8220;acting as&#8221;  in their current positions.  They are moved around laterally, often promoted when their time as &#8220;acting as&#8221; is up.   Nothing is required of them, of course, they are &#8220;for show&#8221; AA hires, most profoundly unintelligent and ill educated, even with their PhDs, not capable of setting or writing policy  &mdash;   that honor goes to Ayers- and Gates-types, the Usual White lefties with the &#8220;latest&#8221;  stoopid solution (and excuses) for closing The Achievement Gap.</p>
<p>Black &#8220;educators&#8221; could not care less about blacks or black education, but then, neither do Gates or Ayers.  </p>
<p>They are only interested in two things:  Money and Power.</p>

		<p>One thing that is a good sign is the number of people here who have stopped watching television. I got rid of the tube years ago and it is unplugging from the Matrix. There are any number of reasons to do so, and it&rsquo;d be worthwhile for race realists and anyone else who wants to maintain sanity to start something of a movement to disestablish TV. The funny thing is, while everyone across the political spectrum criticizes the media, very few people seem capable of unplugging. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also recommend reading serious media critics, such as Jerold Mander (Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television). <br>

<p>You have no idea how unqualified many black teachers are.  I received an MA degree in teaching from an &#8220;urban&#8221; university, earned a 3.9 GPA in a science and social studies major, and didn&rsquo;t learn much of anything.  The curriculum was so dumbed down for the blacks  that people who actually had the ability to learn were left wanting.</p>
<p>Black schools with an all black teaching staff will perform worse than black schools with all white teachers.   In other words, black students learn MORE from white teachers.  That is another dirty little secret in education.  <br>

		<p>If you belonged to the group of Americans(African Americans) who have consistently and systematically been, generation after generation, put out of work by the hoards of illegal aliens-hispanic and Irish; and before them the waves of immigrating Pols, Germans, Italians and eastern Europeans; you too would have more time to watch TV! If you so-called superior white Americans had enough guts to throw the 20 million alien poachers out of our nation, black Americans would have work and therefore have less time to watch TV!</p>

		<p>I am white and enjoy watching TV.  The problem is neither the TV set nor programming content.  Self-styled social critics from Newton Minow onward have been making the same denunciations about the &#8220;idiot box&#8221; for the past 50 years.  </p>
<p>No, the problem is that blacks lead such stunted lives that they can&rsquo;t imagine life beyond television, save for racial mau-mauing for fun and profit.   </p>

		<p>We have variations of these problems in Australia with &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; and racial attacks on whites by &#8216;non white&rsquo; gangs usually Islanders or aboriginals. The aboriginal radio stations openly and continuously transmit hateful language against whits - the same whites that support them in luxury and alcohol which they can&rsquo;t handle, without reprimand, but if a white suggests something that can be construed as hate then that white will be taken before the courts. South Africa; where I was born and raised has the problems in plague proportions. It is a problem created by &#8216;do gooders&rsquo; and people who refuse to face reality&hellip; as a consequence the people that suffer the most in the end are the &#8216;non-whites&rsquo;.</p>
