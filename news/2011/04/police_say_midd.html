		<p>Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Whiteys&rsquo; &#8220;feeling helpless&#8221; is the entire objective of integration, civil rights, affirmative action, diversity quotas, multicultural outreach, interfaith dialogue, transformative leadership, obama-holder, etc.</p>
<p>If White Humanity ever feels that it can go to some authority for help, it just proves that &#8220;we have much more work to do&#8221; to prevent White Unity.</p>
<p>The Diversity Treatment is the Diversity Curse is Afrovoodoo Victory over White Humanity.</p>
<p>Our job isn&rsquo;t to look for help that will never come, but to spread the agony to the White liberal elites who marry Whites Only, attend Whites Only churches and schools, have Whites Only bosses, Whites Only daughters, and are never planning on having mulatto grandbabies.  </p>
<p>We need to find ways to shame them into Exporting their Whitey Diversity into Vibrant and Enriching Multicultural Communities.  They are no longer welcome ours, and if they ever come to us for help&hellip;</p>
<p>The best that we can hope for our race traitors is that they succomb to a mass outbreak of the White Nurse Syndrome: &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t a raciss before I started working here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Three people were shot, and the issue is &#8220;bullying&#8221;?!  If someone got tripped or chewed gum rubbed in their hair, that&rsquo;s bullying.  Once bullets are flying, we&rsquo;re far outside of kid-stuff.  This is just another way of avoiding discussion about the chaos blacks bring.  </p>

		<p>The White women in this video all seemed to be significantly overweight.  I don&rsquo;t want to label them, but they fit the stereotype of the low-class overweight White woman who is the type to date, marry and have sex with Black men, and then to send their little mulattoes to virtually all-Black schools.  How blind are we that many of us can&rsquo;t see that this violence in schools in race-based?  Blacks are violent.  They have an IQ that is lower than Whites and they have more testosterone than Whites.  How long are we going to let ourselves be deceived by political correctness? </p>

		<p>I agree with poster #3.  There are an awful lot of overweight white women with blond hair around here (why are they always blonds?) in my neck of the woods who talk ghetto, date black men and act no different from hood rats.</p>
<p>They send their mixed children to all black schools and then get indignant t all the violence.  (They have a dim memory of how safe their neighborhoods were before they left to join the black underclass.)</p>
<p>I have no sympathy for them.</p>
<p>If you caught the report at the end, it was a girl involved in the initial fight in the middle school.  Does this mean it was an all-girls fight, or a mixed gender beat down or what?</p>

		<p>Did you see the pictures of the shooters?  They weren&rsquo;t middle schoolers, they were adults.  That&rsquo;s part of the problem, the adults many of these kids grow up with or away from.  Dundalk isn&rsquo;t too far away from where I live. It is a sad, scary world we live in when a school fight ends up in a drive by.  </p>

		<p>There is so much that this report doesn&rsquo;t tell us  &mdash;  I am surprised that it shows a picture of the two (Af Am)adults in custody. It&rsquo;s very difficult to get a true idea of what happened  &mdash;  Dundalk used to be a tough working class white neighborhood (think Dundalk Marine Terminal). What has it become?  </p>

		<p>I went to school in Baltimore back in the 1980&rsquo;s and to me &#8220;Dundalk&#8221; meant white working class suburbia.  In other words the people who had fled B&rsquo;more in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s.  Even a glance at the wikipedia page says &#8220;The racial makeup of the CDP was 89.58% White, 7.51% African American&#8221;.  Keep in mind those are 2000 census stats, perhaps things have changed in the past 10 years.</p>

		<p>Looking at the videotape closely, the boy who was shot is Bantu. However, it&rsquo;s ironic to note that all of the mothers interviewed were white. I guess that if all the mothers interviewed were Bantu; then it would be a case of &#8220;same old, same old&rsquo;.</p>

<p>By the way, the White woman&rsquo;s last name was Quintanal which is Spanish. Somehow I doubt she&rsquo;s married to a Spaniard. </p>

		<p>Not our problem.</p>
<p>Just so long as we get our kids out and on a voucher program with rich sponsors who &#8216;understand the problem&rsquo; without wanting to be a part of it.</p>
<p>There are good people out there who are very wealthy and see what is being done to our folk.  If we reach out to them and ask for a school or a house to be owned by a teacher willing to work in a neighborhood system.  We might find some sympathy.</p>
<p>What we need to do is keep isolating blacks and hispanics in a way that it becomes clear that there is NO white involvement at all.  No teachers.  No parents.  No oversight.  Nothing that cannot be laid squarely at the feet of the ethnics themselves.</p>
<p>The rest of our society must see and hold in contempt their violent existence as solely the artifact of their choice to be as they are.</p>
<p>While we send our kids to voucher schools or home school them.</p>

		<p>My son&rsquo;s wife is expecting their first child soon. I told him that, as soon as his child is able, I will pay for self defense and karate lessons for his child. I am adopting the same policy for my wife and I as well. We are taking lethal self-defense lessons. We are seniors, but we refuse to be bullied when the inevitable (fed sponsored) invasion of our town occurs. </p>
<p>We are also taking lessons in handling firearms. We refuse to be defenseless old whites, and no whites should fear these people. Yes, they are usually a lot stronger than we are. But they can be defeated. (I defeated one in a fight years ago. It can be done.) They can be defeated by someone who is able to fight back. They are used to whites fearing them. It&rsquo;s a mistake to fear them. Learn to fight and beat them. Then we will gain the respect that we rightly deserve. Fight, white people! Fight and fight and win! Don&rsquo;t cave in to fear.</p>

		<p>White parents &#8220;feel helpless&#8221; at the onslaught of black violence against their children? Then do something and take your children out of these schools, and stop feeling helpless.</p>
