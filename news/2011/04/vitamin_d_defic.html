<h1><a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/view/576102/?sc=dwhn">Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Different Types of Obesity in Black and White Children</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newswise, April 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A recent study accepted for publication in The Endocrine Society&rsquo;s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism (JCEM) found that while black and white children with vitamin D deficiency both had higher fat levels, black children were more likely to have higher levels of fat just under their skin and white children were more likely to have higher levels of fat between their internal organs.</p>
<p>{snip} However, data characterizing the racial differences in the relationship between obesity and vitamin D, particularly in fat tissue distribution are limited. This study examined the racial differences in the relationship between vitamin D status, BMI, fat levels, fat distribution and lipid levels in healthy obese and non-obese 8-18 year old black and white children.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In this study, researchers measured vitamin D levels in 237 children and found the majority of the study participants were vitamin D deficient. Plasma vitamin D levels were associated inversely with BMI and fat levels and positively with HDL cholesterol in all subjects. Visceral adipose tissue (fat between internal organs) was higher in vitamin D deficient whites and subcutaneous adipose tissue (fat below the skin) was higher in vitamin D deficient blacks compared with their respective vitamin D non-deficient counterparts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides therapeutic interventions to correct the high rates of vitamin D deficiency in youth, benefits of vitamin D optimization on fat levels, lipid profile and risk of type 2 diabetes need to be explored,&#8221; said Arslanian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The article, &#8220;Vitamin D status, adiposity and lipids in Black American and Caucasian children,&#8221; appears in the May 2011 issue of JCEM.</p>

		<p>Further proof we (whites) evolved differently than blacks.  Blacks have natural trouble living in the frozen north because of this.  </p>
<p>Solution, move back to sunny Africa.  As a bonus I hear there are no racist whites there.</p>

		<p>What else is associated with vitamin D deficiency?</p>
<p>Archives of Disease in Childhood <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/61/9/843.short" rel="nofollow">1986;61:843-848 doi:10.1136/adc.61.9.843</a>: &#8220;Proportion of anaemic Muslim and female vitamin D deficient children greater than non-Muslims and male groups&#8221;</p>
<p>Pediatrics <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/64/6/871" rel="nofollow">Vol. 64 No. 6 December 1979, pp. 871-877</a>: &#8220;All infants had been breast-fed and all were black. Ingestion of vitamin D was limited by exclusion of meat and/or dairy products in 21, and no infants had consistently taken supplemental vitamins. Nineteen were members of Muslim or Seventh Day Adventist faiths. Endogenous synthesis of vitamin D was limited by dark skin, by dressing in long garments with hoods and veils, and by air pollution in a densely populated northern city. The return to a more &#8216;natural&rsquo; diet, free of food additives, has been accompanied by the return of a classic disease of industrial society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Medical Journal of Australia <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/175_05_030901/mason/mason.html" rel="nofollow">2001; 175: 236-237</a>: &#8220;Muslim women presenting with bone densitometric evidence of osteoporosis, most of whom were veiled, were found to be 2.5 times more likely to have biochemical evidence of severe vitamin D deficiency than women of European descent.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And yet the ruling elite will destroy the reputation and career of anyone who attempts to look at race in a scientific way. They keep screaming &#8220;we are all the same&#8221; despite the fact that the human races probably correlate well into subspecies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way you can tell me all living tigers, which look and act identical, have several subspecies, but homo sapiens, which look and act differently and have variations in physiology, are just one species with no genetic variation.</p>
<p>One day it will all blow up, and reality will have to be faced. We will look back on the race paranoia of our day with the same disgust and bewilderment that people today do when they think about the Inquisition or Salem Witch Trials.</p>

		<p>Just one more thing that proves American kids are NOT outside in the sun enough - that&rsquo;s what produces Vitamin D naturally.  Nope, the kids are inside either watching TV or surfing the net.  Most are too lazy to get outside, ride bikes, or play sports.  When I was coming up many of my friends weren&rsquo;t allowed to go inside except to use the bathroom during daylight hours.  That forced a lot of creative outdoor play, and nobody was either fat or Vitamin D deficient.</p>

		<p>Kids used to play outside and drink whole milk. Not anymore what with all those child abductions and free-from-prison pedophiles. Now they play videogames and drink soda and eat McDonald&rsquo;s.<br>
White Folk must boycott McDonald&rsquo;s and try to cut back on the soda (never drink diet ) and find sports that blacks don&rsquo;t do well, like swimming and equestrian sports.<br>
All white private and home schoolers need a private sports club since public schools won&rsquo;t allow the home schoolers in. I suggest for parents considering homeschooling to remember not just the three r&rsquo;s but also self-reliant things like woodshop, mechanics, and home ec.</p>
