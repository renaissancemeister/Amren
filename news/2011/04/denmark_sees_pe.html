<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants and their direct descendants now make up some 10.1 per cent of Denmark&rsquo;s population, according to a report confirmed by the official Danish statistics agency.</p>
<p>The Jyllands-Posten daily calculated that official statistics from February showed immigrants and their descendants accounted for 10.1 per cent of the total population, or 562,517 people in a country of some 5,560,628.</p>
<p>Statistics Denmark confirmed the calculation and explained that it defines &#8220;descendants&#8221; as the children in Denmark to foreign nationals, adding that as soon as one of the parents obtains Danish citizenship the children are no longer labelled &#8220;descendants&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nationalities have changed over the past 10 years, particularly following EU enlargement. Now immigration largely takes place as a result of work permits rather than refugees, with Poland in particular as a main country of origin,&#8221; Statistics Denmark Population analyst Dorthe Larsen said.</p>
<p>Since 2001, the far-right, anti-immigration Danish People&rsquo;s Party has been a key ally of the centre-right government and the country&rsquo;s immigration policies are today considered among the most restrictive in Europe.</p>

<p>And Denmark will rue the day they ever listened to their multicults and allowed those people into their country.</p>
<p>When France goes up in smoke from their black and Muslim populations, Britain and Denmark won&rsquo;t be far behind. </p>
<p>Diversity is a recipe for disaster.<br>

		<p>The statistics can be a bit misleading.  A quick search shows that as of 2009 54% of said immigrant population was from elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d estimate Denmark&rsquo;s nonwhite population to be at around 5-7% at the most.  Not that this is a good thing, in my personal opinion 1% is way too much.</p>

		<p>The big problem in good old Denmark: young thugs, typically from Kurdish, Somali, Palestinian, or Pakestani heritage. Don&rsquo;t want to work. Instead, hang out on the street, insult Danish women, perhaps deal drugs, pretend to suffer from discrimination (and Danish liberals readily kowtow). </p>
<p>Even worse: chain migration. Young thug goes back to Pakistan (Kurdistan, Somalia, etc) to find wife. Thug is not fully assimilated, and wife not at all. Danishness evaporates. Children born are even less Danish. </p>
<p>Solution? Dansk Folkeparti has tried to keep young thug from going back to the home-country village to find a wife. Trouble is, EU policy is against this, and Denmark is not able to go against EU policy. </p>

		<p>Im from Denmark and it should be noted that the 10% also includes immigrants from European countries. I believe non-white immigrants only make up about 5,5%, and most of them being Muslims and Africans. However since my country has low level of political correctness, the media bluntly report the news so it feels like Muslims and Africans make up at least 20%.</p>

		<p>I am irked to no end how ethnic affiliations are so easily expanded to include others outside the group.</p>
<p>If I move to China and even somehow get citizenship, and then go all over the world and tell people I&rsquo;m Chinese, they would see my blond hair and white skin and laugh at me.  Same goes true for Nigerian, Bangladeshi, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>But if I am a dark-skinned man from X, Y or Z country, and I get residency in Denmark, then I&rsquo;m Danish!  The Danes are an ETHNIC group.  You can&rsquo;t &#8216;join&rsquo; it.  </p>
<p>Countries like the U.S., Canada and Australia are confessional nations, not based on a race or ethnic group.  But old world countries in Europe or Asia especially, and their borders, are generally based on ethnic/racial factors.</p>
<p>I have ancestors from most northern and western european countries, so I could join the swedes, danes, scots or germans due to blood kindred, but if I move to Laos, no one would say I am a laotian or a hmong.</p>
<p>White liberals love diversity so much they even cheapen their own racial and ethnic identity down to a label that can be interchanged with any asian, african or other non-white person.</p>

<p>There are white citizens in Singapore (from Ukraine).  They are called Singaporeans without anyone there laughing.</p>

<p>_________________________</p>
<p>That is because Singapore is not a nation-state. It is a purely artificial creation   &mdash;   an economic entity, nothing more   &mdash;    cobbled together from this ahd that, much like New York City, where nobody has any clear ethnic identity, except for the elites who run it/them.</p>
<p>Singapore is a freak  situation, the exception to the rule.   But we&rsquo;ll see how long it lasts.       </p>

		<p>Unless I am mistaken, are the figures not misleading?</p>
<p>In the article it states that: &#8220;Statistics Denmark confirmed that {&hellip;.} as soon as one of the parents obtains Danish citizenship the children are no longer labelled &ldquo;descendants&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the elephant in the room? </p>
<p>How many non-whites are there in Denmark who *have* obtained citizenship and had many children - and how many children have they had themselves?  The article implies that they will not be categorised as &#8220;descendants&#8221; of foreign extraction. </p>
<p>Perhaps the real figure could potentially be double in real terms?  I have never been there, so I cannot possibly gauge. </p>
<p>To give an indication here in Britain about the lies we are told, officially we were supposed to have 8,000 Chinese people in the city of Manchester.  However, in a court trial, the Home Office had to admit (through official secrets acts) that the real figure of Chinese people was between 40,000 and 50,000. </p>
<p>Apologies if I have it wrong, but that clause of definition in the article seemed to jump out at me. </p>

		<p>Immigrants and descendants make up 10% of Denmark&rsquo;s population today.<br>
Soon to be 20%, then 50, then ???  </p>
<p>America is now just under 60% white and dropping fast. It took only 45 years for it&rsquo;s disastrous 1965 immigration policy to change the face of the United States and in another generation it will be a third world country marred by poverty and violence with whites running scared wherever they are outnumbered.</p>
<p>Denmark has to act now if they want to avoid our fate.</p>
