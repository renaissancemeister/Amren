		<p>WE AGREE!  Where can we send the check to keep their momentum going?</p>
<p>Whites should never associate with blacks, and our White teachers waste themselves trying to teach low blacks how to read, write, and speak like English Lords and Ladies.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s embrace the kind of Empowered Diversity that says only blacks can teach blacks and only Whites can teach Whites.</p>
<p>NO MORE BLACK TEACHERS FOR WHITE CHILDREN would be a strong step in the right direction toward blacks only and Whites Only schools.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s help the NAN call for an overturn of Brown v. Board!</p>

		<p>Maybe he will be successful. No more white teachers for black students. No more books written by whites. No more white ideas. No more dressing white or talking white or acting white in school. No more working for whitey or paying him rent. No more eating food grown by white farmers or buying anything made by white guys. </p>
<p>We need to help get this going. This is good.</p>

		<p>GO FOR IT!!!  Segregate black students and teachers from Whites in the schools. Hispanics also need hispanic teachers. Segregate hispanics from Whites in the schools. Same for Asians, Arabs and all the rest. The ONLY students who are suffering for the mess we have now are WHITE ones!</p>
<p>Then from there we will segregate neighborhoods, cities and States. OKAY? Let us push for this 24/7. Segregation NOW AND FOREVER!</p>

		<p>I agree with two added stipulations.</p>
<p>No white tax dollars should go to educate blacks.  Perhaps that is harsh, but I live in a state that is basically going bankrupt because of deeply institutionalized theft of tax money by black schools.  Understand&hellip;.the entire state, one of the richest, by the way, so much money being stolen by black schools that the state may be forced to shut down.</p>
<p>The second stipulation is, all jobs not involving directly working with black students should be filled by whites, not blacks.  Because that is where the problem usually is.  It&rsquo;s not the black teacher that is the cause of most of the problems, it&rsquo;s the black administrator with 20 phantom employees lining his pockets.  Very rare among whites, it&rsquo;s almost universal among blacks.</p>
<p>The current system works something like this.  A black who can barely read (usually cannot read) is hired as a gym teacher, then principle, then school administrator, under AA.  Once he gets control of the budget, he immediately starts stealing millions while everything deteriorates.  And by everything, I mean EVERYTHING.  100% of the time, they will allow the school to turn into something you&rsquo;d see in a zimbabwe slum.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s time to blame whitey. One might notice that the &#8220;poor&#8221; district, of color can only raise about 75% to 80% what its &#8220;rich&#8221; white sister districts do.  Then a federal judge will illegally mandate that these other districts must subsidize the black ones (not that budgets should be equal as ONLY black districts get money).</p>
<p>Over time, more and more money is stolen, while little to any of it is used for schools or kids.  Eventually, it&rsquo;s noticed that the black districts are spending 5 to 10 times what the white districts are but look like crackhouses and nobody knows why.  In fact, it becomes impossible to find out why as an all powerful teacher&rsquo;s union blocks all attempts at reform&hellip;.up to including hiring thugs to bash politicians and threaten them with death.</p>
<p>Easily fixed if you put your foot down over race.  Or at least limit the damage to their own.</p>

		<p>I like hearing them in their own words, speaking to their own. Sharpton and Co. surely live in an alternate reality. Upside down and Backwards world. The NAN panel is so full of hatred and paranoia, they actually think that the MSM holds Obama to a higher standard than prior presidents. Of course, in our reality based world, the MSM is nothing less than fawning on the Prez and the First Lady. I&rsquo;ve never seen a POTUS that has been handled with such kid gloves, and I&rsquo;ve lived through eight!</p>
<p>The nonsense spouted by the panelist about the lack of blacks on construction sites is pretty funny. Most ghetto blacks will be unemployable. Blacks have it so good here it makes one sick to listen to their whining rhetoric about how bad they have it. Just yesterday I overheard a converstation between black welfare mothers about what they will do with the 7k-10k tax returns they are expecting from the IRS. Tax returns from welfare? It boggles the mind!  With my full time job I&rsquo;m expecting a few hundred back that will be used to pay bills. </p>

		<p>Okay, so you don&rsquo;t want white teachers teaching your kids.  Fine.  Now insist that that dirty, nasty, white money not be used in your schools, and have them be supported 100% by black taxpayers.</p>

		<p>Okay, long-time reader but first time poster here. I am so sick of the black community, period. They are never satisfied with what is GIVEN to them, and I stress &#8220;given&#8221;. The word &#8220;earn&#8221; is never a part of their vocabulary. It seems like yesterday that they were clamoring for black children to be educated alongside white children. They claimed that black children could excel if given (there&rsquo;s that word again) the same educational tools as whites. So, it was given to them. And surprise, surprise, they failed miserably. Now they claim that they can&rsquo;t excel with &#8220;a different class of people&#8221; teaching them. It&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous. It has been proven time and again that blacks are not an industrious, intelligent people. I say, Al you are right. Take your black children out of the white schools. Build your own schools and go nuts. How these people managed to exist beyond their first 100 years is beyond me. I can hardly contain my disdain for them on a daily basis.</p>

		<p>Three things here:</p>
<p>(1) How is this so different from George Wallace standing in the entranceway of the University of Alabama and insisting that blacks and whites shouldn&rsquo;t study together?</p>
<p>(2) Where do they get these panelists? If you see construction going on in a black neighborhood and no blacks are working on it, you gotta SHUT IT DOWN?!  &mdash;  Everyone ought to know by now that if other people don&rsquo;t do the work, it won&rsquo;t get done at all! If blacks come together and get angry enough, they can accomplish ANYTHING?!  &mdash;  I&rsquo;ve never seen a gaggle of angry blacks accomplish anything except mayhem.  </p>
<p>(3) Why does anyone listen to Al Sharpton anymore? How many times can one man make a fool of himself, through false accusations and jumping to conclusions without facts, and still be taken seriously?</p>

Most of the problems in the black community that the black community complain about are the result of integration.</p>
<p>Blacks will complain about the public schools but they will never propose or agree to segregated schools because to do so would mean they would have to admit they were wrong and the segregationists were right.</p>
<p>There are many issues they discuss here and I don&rsquo;t want to through each one and point out the fallacies except the claim that President Obama is being held to a higher standard.</p>
<p>President Obama has, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, gotten a pass on most every issue. Other presidents would be eviscerated for the problems in our economy as were Carter, Bush I, Bush II, Hoover, and many others.</p>
<p>How much any president can do to turn around economic conditions is a source of endless debates. However, with President Obama, critics and supporters have rarely expected him to find solutions.</p>
<p>Bush II was responsible for a hurricane. Why isn&rsquo;t Obama responsible for tornadoes? Has you heard anyone ask, &#8220;Why isn&rsquo;t President Obama doing more to help the victims of the tornadoes?&#8221;<br>

<p>I agree with that.  Blacks should also go to all black schools, live in all black neighborhoods in all black areas of the country, working ast all black businesses.</p>
<p>Blacks should be segregated, because they bring down white society to levels that are below the white norm.  No race on earth is as incompetent as black primitives, nor as prone to criminality and violence.<br>

		<p>To SBuffalonative. Bush got blamed for FEMA&rsquo;s inept response. Exactly what the Rovian Republicans preached about came back to haunt the GOP. Small government and big tax breaks for big corporations. Disaster capitalists. But back to Big Al. I wish this guy made more sense like this like once every ten years would be nice. We want blacks taught by blacks, too. What a great idea. But somehow the lefties will sweep this under the rug. But why? I thought black leaders speak with a golden voice. Every word should be listened to intently. </p>

		<p>What a shame that it&rsquo;s only a dream! Imagine! Blacks actually taking &#8220;responsibility&#8221; for any of their actions or their outcomes. Blacks are &#8220;streetsmart&#8221;. Their are many things that they don&rsquo;t know, but one thing that most of them will understand is that if they have to take &#8220;responsibility&#8221; as one of them said, for themselves, they&rsquo;d have less to blame on whites. That would destroy a lot of psyches in the black &#8220;community&#8221;. They&rsquo;d never allow that. It&rsquo;s too easy and convenient to use the &#8216;guilt whip&rsquo; on whitey and weedle and cajole all that they want out of the white suckers who can&rsquo;t fight off the guilt. </p>
<p>Whites need to wake up and insist that they take responsibility for themselves, but it will never happen. Too many whites want to find themselves as &#8220;the root cause&#8221; of the world&rsquo;s problems. Too bad. It will destroy our race in the long run. It is working quite well right now. Wake up white people!</p>

		<p>I never thought I would agree with Al Sharpton, but if he wants blacks to take the responsibility for educating black children, it can be theirs to do. Al, we&rsquo;ll even give you the money if you take your kids and leave! However, once you start, this is now on you; White racism is not the cause of all of your problems. </p>
<p>If Al wants to see real racism up close and personal, go be a third country national working in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. Even though most of these people are Muslim, they are treated worse than anything you normally see here. Almost any Black in America would be treated better by the local Grand Dragon of the K, than by the Saudis or Kuwaitis. I served over there. </p>
<p>Before the economy started to implode, I moved out of a major metropolitan area to the sticks and paid substantial amount for a house in a really white school district. My school district is approximately 95% White and there are more Asians than Blacks (I&rsquo;m guessing mostly girls adopted from China). The school district I went to was probably 30% White in the 1980&rsquo;s and is now 18% White (there aren&rsquo;t enough Asians or Hispanics in that district to make a real dent in the scores, yet). The high school that my wife attended had 1 Black student and maybe 2 - 3 Hispanic students in the mid-80&rsquo;s, but the area where she lived has seen a mass out migration of whites and an influx of Hispanics. This high school has been turned into a combo middle and high school. </p>
<p>I can think of 1 really good Black teacher in my elementary school and 2 decent ones in high school. Most of the others were glorified jailers who were incorporated when the district started integrating in the late 60&rsquo;s/early 70&rsquo;s. Maybe they were fine for the segregated schools but didn&rsquo;t fare too well with white students who were usually smarter. In my &#8220;school within a school&#8221; designed to retain what few White students they could, most of the teachers were 50-something year old white women who were just biding their time until they could retire and start collecting a pension. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you see construction going on in a black neighborhood and no blacks are working on it, you gotta SHUT IT DOWN.&#8221; </p>
<p>The only thing they know how to shut down is White success with the help of our own traitors.  </p>

		<p>I was a child during school segregation in WV, a state that had and still has a small percentage of blacks.  The top county education officials were white, but otherwise the blacks administered their own schools.  I can&rsquo;t imagine any white teacher even applying for a job at a black school in those days.  Some black principals and teachers were upset at integration because they lost their high positions and had to start performing under direct white authority.<br>
If blacks want to run and man their own schools, governments should of course let them.  Allow them to be financially supported the way every other school in that state or city is.  Of course, when the federal money is cut off or even equalized, these schools may end up looking like some did before desegregation  &mdash;  but, hey, it will be the blacks&rsquo; own doing.  Blacks who want to attend majority-white schools in their areas would of course still be able to because of the law.  <br>
People like Sharpton are apparently trying to get white teachers out of the picture so that more blacks can take their place and so that blacks can have more control of the money and power involved.  No doubt, they also hope to escape white criticism.  <br>
Since the blacks are the people suggesting these changes, liberals should embrace the ideas with open arms.<br>
After a half century of struggle, the experiment to &#8220;close the achievement gap&#8221; has failed utterly, despite not just equal opportunity but every kind of incentive and perk imaginable.  Things are beginning to settle back to normal.</p>

While black education is important, it is in America&rsquo;s best interest that black education be more Euro-centric and less black in order to avert the somber prospects of an advanced tribal mutiny.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s Euro-centric teaching structure does cause blacks to become miseducated leaving out consideration for their culture and heritage.<br>
                                                         However, black professioanls are equally <br>

<p>Since more than 70% of blacks belong to a sub-standard learning group, and less than 30% have higher learning abilities, blacks must be segregated in order for black education to be aligned properly.  </p>

		<p>I read in the article where it says,</p>
<p>Only blacks should educate blacks.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t this already been said in the phrase The Blind Leading The Blind?</p>
<p>I taught hundreds of black kids when I was a teacher and I can tell you this, out of 1000 blacks in school maybe one has any interest in learning. They just take up space.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It seems like yesterday that they were clamoring for black children to be educated alongside white children. They claimed that black children could excel if given (there&rsquo;s that word again) the same educational tools as whites. So, it was given to them. And surprise, surprise, they failed miserably&#8221;</p>

Welcome to the War Room. <br>
Not only did THEY fail miserably but due to the dumbing down for their benefit that never materialized, they brought everyone down with them.</p>

<p>Interesting that he can make an open call for what sounds like incitement to violence, or at least obstruction of lawful activities. Does this count as &#8220;hate&#8221; speech? <br>

One is reminded of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s dictum about people who only know how to destroy. </p>

		<p>Blacks&rsquo; worst enemy in the fight to regain control over their lives is the liberal &#8216;enablement&rsquo; industry which seeks to help them solve all their problems.  For a price.</p>
<p>Nanny Statism is also our problem because it insists we cannot continue to rule our lives if it might hurt someone else.</p>
<p>If only a tiny fraction of the black population is suitable for college, you have to either change the curriculum or change the standards of hiring to avoid the bottlenecks of a suitable degree in teaching across 2 or more subjects and 3 or more grades.</p>
<p>I would be interested in seeing if this could be made to work.  You would have fewer black rocket scientist wannabes but perhaps more genuine black career fields that didn&rsquo;t involve moving a ball across astroturf or a waxed floor.</p>
<p>As a level of pragmatic education I also wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing some whites head back towards.</p>
<p>Much of what we deem &#8216;euro-centric&rsquo; teaching (i.e. a classical, balanced, education) comes from the lingering effects of specialized apprenticeships and guild systems that rose in the middle ages, specifically to hoarde knowledge from the classes above and below them.  Rendering themselves &#8216;essential&rsquo; and thus wealthy independent skill sources who deliberately withheld critical knowledge from junior levels of employment, simply to enforce an apprentice&gt;journeyman&gt;master level of paid dues and loyal submission to a controlled competition.</p>
<p>The institutionalization of this system, beginning in the mid 1800s as a school system which taught increasingly esoteric subjects resulted in the loss of a LOT of basic manual abilities in carpentry, plumbing and electrical, only a century later.</p>
<p>This, in favor of &#8216;learning European history&rsquo; or advanced mathematics or or or, which is great if you plan to be part of a ruling political or scientific elite but doesn&rsquo;t do much if your future lies more along the lines of Ford or a Federal Job where certain manual/practical skills are useful.</p>
<p>The perpetuation of non practical skillsets at the cost of all others also reduce any sense of self sufficiency as willpower to near zero.  There is no adversarial sense of problem solving for it&rsquo;s own sake outside of a formularized system.</p>
<p>European History is about to go into the waste bin as one of the most wasted great opportunities ever (in 1950, we formed 1/3rd of the planetary population with the absolute edge in technology and cultural dynamacy, look what we did with it).</p>
<p>But particularly as we drift towards a service economy entropy and outright racial hegemony in certain areas of the country, knowing what Ohm&rsquo;s Law (i=v/r) means in laying out the circuit routes and loads in a home could mean the difference, not between a 20 dollar an hour blue collar job and a 60 dollar an hour office position.  But between having lights and going dark.</p>
<p>If this country takes a final dive, the first thing that goes will be standards maintenance.  And yet standards are only code speak for exclusive knowledge, built up institutionally, for solving certain practical problems in a way that works the most efficiently and safely and can be applied broadly, in the square-circle real world.</p>
<p>Which is why, while I insist that blacks problems should not be ours, we could really use to look at our own education system and start to _plan for a future_ where the notion of a &#8216;national anything&rsquo; is no longer taken to mean &#8216;you will do it our way, even if it is _inefficient_.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Playing the national money-chaser game is playing into the hands of those who already &#8216;own&rsquo; (game) a system which I hope is not going to persist much longer.</p>

		<p>Here is a comment from Larry Auster&rsquo;s site under the thread titled &#8220;Who&rsquo;s manning the front lines in the hell on earth that is underclass black America?&#8221;</p>

<i>I was one of those &#8220;manning the front lines in the hell on earth that is underclass black America.&#8221; I want to make a short comment now, and perhaps a longer one later today. Regardless of what I say, I can never do justice to how bad things really are. You have to experience inner city schools to have any idea of what is going on. </i></p>
<p><i>The sooner white people realize that working in these schools is prolonging this horrible state of affairs, the sooner we may turn a corner and begin to regain control of one of America&rsquo;s most important institutions. Right now, white teachers and administrators are just cleaning up &#8220;their (blacks&rsquo;) mess&#8221;. If whites would just get out, it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for the whole thing to implode and the mess would hit the fan. What is described in Philadelphia is true of New York, is true of &hellip; you fill in the city! Without whites to cover up the madness in these hell holes, America will learn what I&rsquo;ve now known for 40 plus years. &#8220;In your wildest dreams, you could never imagine what went on today.&#8221; </i></p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s an embarrassment to say I made my living doing what I did. No person with a shred of self respect would subject himself to these environments. My professional life was truly wasted! </i></p>
<p>These white female teachers are wasting their lives trying to teach non-whites and they are making a major contribution to the system that is grinding us into dust.  One of these days whites must start making INSISTENT demands for our own schools as one of the things they system owes us as, dare I say it, reparations for the Modern American Holocaust.</p>

		<p>Sounds GREAT to me!!!  As long as well-educated and un-brainwashed WHITES choose the curriculum!!  Sure, get these miserably behaved black kids OUT of the schools with whites - bring back school segregation.  Integration clearly hasn&rsquo;t worked.  Next, have Hispanics educate Hispanic kids with the white curriculum.  And Chinese with Chinese, Native American with Native American - let&rsquo;s do the thing properly, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!  Better yet, imbue the blacks with the desire to go back home to Africa, to go save Haiti, to simply LEAVE this country.  We really could get along just fine without them.  Ditto the Hispanics (but I&rsquo;d keep the good Mexican restaurants).  I mean, if people want to be here, they can be here under the white rule that was set up from the beginning.  All attempts to change it have turned to waste, so let&rsquo;s do the right thing and go back to what works.</p>
