<h1>Census: Hispanics Surpass Blacks in Most US Metros</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Yahoo! News, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics now outnumber African-Americans for the first time in most U.S. metropolitan areas, shifting the political and racial dynamics in cities once dominated by whites and blacks.</p>
<p>Census figures released Thursday highlight the growing diversity of the nation&rsquo;s 366 metro areas, which were home to a record 83.7 percent share of the U.S. population. The numbers from the 2010 count are already having a big effect on redistricting in many states, where district boundary lines are being redrawn based on population size and racial makeup.</p>
<p>Hispanics became the largest minority group in 191 metropolitan areas last year, their population lifted higher as blacks left many economically hard-hit cities in the North for the South and new Latino immigrants spread to different parts of the country. That&rsquo;s up from 159 metro areas when the previous Census was taken in 2000, when Hispanics were most commonly found in Southwest border states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census Bureau reported last month that overall Hispanic population jumped 42 percent in the last decade to 50.5 million, or 1 in 6 Americans. Blacks increased a modest 11 percent to 37.7 million, with declines particularly evident in big cities such as New York, Detroit, Cleveland, and St. Louis, Mo.</p>
<p>&#8220;A greater Hispanic presence is now evident in all parts of the country  &mdash;  in large and small metropolitan areas, in the Snowbelt and in the Sunbelt,&#8221; said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, who analyzed the census data. &#8220;From now on, local, state and national politicians will need to pay attention to Hispanics rather than treating blacks as the major minority,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republicans generally hold the advantage in redrawing the political maps after taking control of legislatures in many states in last November&rsquo;s elections. But many black legislators are pushing for strong enforcement of the federal Voting Rights Act from the Obama Justice Department, which must preapprove political maps for several states and ensure that minority voting power is not unreasonably diluted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The demographic phenomenon we&rsquo;re seeing could cause some big concerns in terms of African-American seats,&#8221; said Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, citing improvements in racial integration between blacks and whites in many metro areas that will make line-drawing more difficult. &#8220;It&rsquo;s likely to make changes on how we view African-American seats.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The figures released Thursday show that the white share of the population declined in all 366 metro areas, while all but five showed gains in Asian population shares  &mdash;  Honolulu (slipping from 45 percent to 43 percent), El Centro, Calif.; Sioux City, Iowa; Logan, Utah; and Kokomo, Ind.</p>

		<p>Another twilight-zone exposition from the university researchers and reporters in the media. They&rsquo;ve spent the last 40 years moving the voting lines around in efforts to maximize &#8216;minority participation&rsquo; and provide equal or proportional &#8216;minority representation&rsquo;. Always one direction of course. No efforts to elect white city council members and mayors in white-minority cities. You&rsquo;d never know it by reading this piece. The reader is intended to draw the opposite, twilight zone, conclusion. Just another day in paradise. </p>

Hmmm.  I wonder just what he considers  to be &#8220;improvements&#8221;?<br>
I suspect his idea of &#8220;improvements&#8221; is not the same as mine.</p>
<p><br>
(Hint:  To him, black invasion, white decline and disempowerment would be an &#8220;improvement&#8221;.)</p>

This is why it is foolish for Democrats to look forward to a time when whites are in the minority. A coalition of two racial groups that dislike each other will be unstable. The Democrats need to win back most of the white working class, and much of the South. They cannot do that by promoting affirmative action, forced school busing, and open borders. </p>

		<p>As a 65 year old white Southerner, I can tell you from experience that I&rsquo;d much rather deal with a poorer Mexican population than with ghetto blacks.  Most of the Mexicans are pretty decent people and they don&rsquo;t mind if you shop in their stores or eat in their restaurants.  Blacks, now   &mdash;   don&rsquo;t even go NEAR their &#8216;hood.  It&rsquo;s a real good way to get shot in the head just because you&rsquo;re white.  I live in SoCA, and this is how it is here.  I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m happy about the Hispanic influx, but I personally consider it a bit better than the black ghetto folk; they are just d**n mean, and murderous to boot.  I always carry a couple of pretty nasty knives on me - you never know when somebody will try to jump you, even in broad daylight.</p>

		<p>Many Democrats keep crowing about a black/brown coalition, which is much like whistling past the graveyard.  They hope, I suppose, that whites will simply give up and surrender the country.  Instead, the left&rsquo;s efforts are causing a white backlash.<br>
The very notion of a black/brown coalition is, of course, very shaky.  Hispanics in the U.S. comprise several ethnic groups with often differing goals and outlooks.  They can more easily assimilate into mainstream society than blacks can.  About one-third of them tend to vote Republican, and many of them probably see the wisdom of aligning with whites against blacks  &mdash;  especially when it comes to municipal elections.  What Hispanic wants to live in the next Detroit?<br>
By leaving Northern cities, blacks are watering down their political power.  In the South, whites vote much more as a bloc than in other regions, and blacks have little chance in statewide elections.  </p>

		<p>Blacks are too busy hating and baiting whites to notice they are being marginalized by Hispanics.  In less than a generation they have been run out of work and homes by hoards of Hispanics.  Nearly 1/3 of the Mexican population now lives in the US and they are aiming primarily at the softest targets; blacks.  <br>
 <br>
In Atlanta the black &#8220;leadership&#8221; is watching their political power evaporate and they are running scared.  Their control of the North Fulton money stream is fading fast as new towns are incorporated and refuse to send a dime into Atlanta.  So they know their days are numbered and Atlanta will soon be retaken by more responsible whites.  I look forward to an Atlanta renaissance.  But it took the harsh reality of black leadership for people to realize where the obvious failings occur.<br>
 <br>
The race card has expired.  Blacks are slowly learning this, but that is to be expected.  Generations of handouts will be hard to forget.<br>

		<p>The question is why Hispanics are becoming a fast growing ethnic group. Is it because immigration laws are not being enforced? Is it because of anchor babies? Is it because Hispanics have alot of kids even though they can&rsquo;t provide for them? Do they over stay their visas? Even if they came to America legally, why have so many been allowed to do so. I thought their was a quota system for each country whose people wanted to come to America. Is that system not enforced anymore?</p>

		<p>I agree with ole White missis.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times and the pathetic TV news stations reported that the Los Angeles crime rate went drastically down and that the murder rate was down to 1969 levels.  They pondered and pontificated on exactly why this should be but never mentioned the cause.</p>
<p>The lowering of the crime rate is due to one thing and one thing only, the replacement of blacks by Hispanics and other immigrants.</p>
<p>I have seen this is my own White neighborhood.  West Los Angeles and Santa Monica.  In the 1980&rsquo;s there was a lot of street crime in those areas.  The Santa Monica blacks terrorized Santa Monica and W. LA.  The blacks from south central, Watts and Inglewood drove up on the freeway, got off, committed burglaries, robberies, murders and rapes.  Then they got right back on the freeway before the police could even be called.  </p>
<p>In fact, during the 1970&rsquo;s to the mid 1990&rsquo;s property values went down around the freeway off ramps because of the black terrorists using them to rob, rape and murder Whites.</p>
<p>But since the blacks have moved out of south central, Watts, Inglewood and the Section 8 parts of Santa Monica, W.LA and Santa Monica are as safe as they were 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t move to Riverside or San Bernadino counties or Palmdale or Lancaster in LA county.  Those areas are where the blacks have moved and they are as dangerous for Whites as the Watts adjacent areas were 50 years ago when black terrorists ram rampant in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Crime went drastically down starting about 1990 in W Los Angeles as the Hispanics established a perimeter defense between south central and West Los Angeles.  The Armenian, Persian, Israeli, Arab and Russian immigrants helped a lot.  They established small businesses on the business streets and patrolled the areas and ran off the blacks who used to rob the businesses, hijack cars and rob and rape pedestrians in those areas.</p>
<p>Recently I saw a photocopied poster up in Westwood blvd, aka &#8220;Little Teheran.&#8221;  Some black thugs robbed a pedestrian.  The store owners reviewed their camera film and caught not just the mugging but the license number of the car and clear shots of the black thugs.  </p>
<p>The store owners were not robbed, but they got together, reviewed their film and put together the poster.  The immigrants did what the police cannot due because the thugs were black and here in America blacks are encouraged and enabled by our government to murder, rape, rob and terrorize Whites.</p>
<p>Having seen how immigrants of all races deal with black criminals, I feel far safer than I did 20 years ago when black terrorists ran amuck in the neighborhood.</p>

While this casual assumption may apply in California and much of the West, the same formula doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often assumed by posters on AR that &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; means mestizos from Mexico.  Not so!  Not here on the East Coast, from the crowded North East to Florida. Here, they tend to come from the Caribbbean. And the simple fact is that they are often brown or black themselves.   Therefore, there  won&rsquo;t be the neat brown/black division that you are counting on.</p>

<p>I live in Florida and Florida is rife with mestizos from Mexico, Central and South America, just as California is, though Mexicans far outnumber other latins there.  I used to live there as well.</p>
<p>Sporadically throughout the rest of the country in mostly urban areas this same mix of latins is present, but they&rsquo;re mostly Mexican. In fact many urban areas are inundated with them.  If <br>
you do a Google on latin Anerican migration to the US, I think you&rsquo;ll find that it is the mestizos rather than the black Hispanics that dominate by a truly huge margin.  </p>
<p>Searching further I think you&rsquo;ll find that there are black/mestizo conficts almost everywhere in the US where they <br>
live near one another.</p>
<p>The black/brown conflicts are said by two high profile experts to be the beginning of our second civil war, with the epicenter in Los Angeles, then spreading throughout the country. </p>
<p>Also, if you run a Google on Latin gangs, you&rsquo;ll see that this same mix of mestizos have many street gangs in almost every urban area as well.</p>

		<p>Stories like this depress me because they bring out the people who compare blacks to Hispanics and conclude that hey, the Hispanic invasion is not so bad after all. I think that this attitude among a lot of our people is part of the problem. We are not being asked to make a choice here, choose A or B. How about choosing our own?</p>

		<p> I have to agree with &#8220;Ole White Missus&#8221;. While not happy about the brown invasion, Mexicans are a step above blacks. The silver lining of the cloud is that white sympathy for blacks may decrease if the Mexicans maintain their reputation for working and co-existing. In fact, as we become more racially diverse, we might find more scepticism about what is &#8216;owed&rsquo; to blacks.</p>

		<p>Fascinating, but expected.</p>
<p>The next century will make or break whites in the America.  Will those of us like minded individuals gather together(think Orania in South Africa, but much much bigger and far more open about its racial intentions) and carve out a new nation for ourselves, or will we as a race simply fade into obscurity?  If we don&rsquo;t &#8216;win&rsquo; then we didn&rsquo;t deserve to.  Humanity has no room for losers in its gene pool.</p>
<p>The only question I have is this:  Why haven&rsquo;t we already started on it?  It&rsquo;s not due to a lack of numbers.  Or funding.  My own two cents is that we lack a charismatic leader.</p>

		<p>If there are 20 million illegals (conservatively) in the country and the Census is counting people regardless of their citizenship status then there are really only about 30 million hispanics in the country.  That puts them at about 10-11 percent of the population.  They haven&rsquo;t really surpassed blacks as the largest minority but they will within the decade assuming nothing changes with immigration, enforcement or birthrate citizenship.    </p>

<p>&#8220;As we grow more racially diverse&#8221;?  Sounds like wishful thinking to me.  The fact is we&rsquo;re not replacing one group with another, we&rsquo;re getting the whole black and brown enchilada.  People are tired of this invasion and the public has already applied their foot the brakes.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before these people are sent back where they came from.<br>

		<p>Beginning in the late 1940&rsquo;s Whites began to leave inner cities for the newly built suburbs (most of which had covenants that prohibited sales to blacks). Blacks who had started moving into northern cities from the deep south expanded into these areas further pushing white flight. Now with black expansion into formerly all white suburbs whites are leaving in droves for more rural areas even though it might mean a much longer drive to work or telecommuting. Even though Mexicans and other Hispanics can be friendly at first when there is enough of a population they tend to get as territorial as blacks. We have done several thousand dollars in upgrades and improvements to try to sell and get out of our neighborhood before the Mexicans totally take over. Our park is already hostile territory and my daughter and I are glared at if we are there when a large group of Hispanics are there. </p>

<p><br>
As of now, it looks like obscurity looms ahead.  We have received all of the warning signals, but have done nothing about the crisis we face.</p>
<p>History is full of conquerors and powerful groups  who built empires, and then faded into obscurity. Look at Alexander&rsquo;s Greeks scattered though Persia and Afghanistan;  the vast empire of the Mongols stretching from Poland to India;  the Vandals  who disappeared into North Africa.  All gone without a trace.</p>
<p>Look at the once &#8220;Great&#8221; Britain&hellip;  just a century ago a world power whose navy ruled the seas and whose empire  spanned the globe, now reduced  (by its own abdication) to an inconsequential little island being invaded from all directions. And not by more powerful peoples, but by more primitive peoples!!!</p>
<p>Will we too become just another passing blip in history?  Are we on that path?  The USA has existed for a mere  two centuries, and we&rsquo;re already skidding on  the downward slope, our business and political &#8220;leaders&#8221; eagerly selling us out for their own personal profit;  our foundin g race being  reviled and persecuted in their own land; our great cities crumbling and our states up for grabs and being invaded from everywhere on earth.  Just two centuries!   That&rsquo;s much less time than it took for Imperial Rome to crumble. And we talk about Roman decadence!  We went from virtue to decadence in a generation.</p>
<p>But we will not vanish totally.  I suppose that in a thousand years, there will be an occasional &#8220;American&#8221; type, a genetic throwback, that randomly appears here or  there, and which  is viewed by its contemporaries as a bizarre  oddity, perhaps even a blue-eyed blond   &mdash;   just like those green-eyed Afghans we  see photographed in the National Geographic.  </p>
<p>For their sake, let&rsquo;s just hope their body parts are not viewed as good for making powerful juju, as albinos are in Africa today.</p>

		<p>I respectfully must disagree with the common Amren poster who says &#8216;hispanics are better than blacks&rsquo;.  It is true that blacks, after having whites tell them for the past 60 years that whitey caused all of their problems, tend to be violent.  However, their numbers are stable or in decline. The 2010 census has shown only a few metro areas with an increase in blacks.  They also segregate in smaller areas.</p>
<p>Something else to remember is that black American descendants of slaves, like it or not, are Americans.  They have been here for anywhere from about 200-400 years.  Maybe I just old fashioned, but I suppose I have a sense of noblesse oblige, if just a slight one.  </p>
<p>Blacks may have destroyed the inner city (enabled by SWPL and liberal whites), but hispanics first destroy inner cities and then slowly creep into the suburbs.  And there is no end in sight. Trading the stable population of blacks for hispanic alien invaders, who - as Jupiter7 says - are replacing native born white Americans block by block, for the sake of some imaginary comfort, is foolish. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I live in Florida and Florida is rife with mestizos from Mexico, Central and South America, just as California is, though Mexicans far outnumber other latins there. I used to live there as well.<br>
Sporadically throughout the rest of the country in mostly urban areas this same mix of latins is present, but they&rsquo;re mostly Mexican. In fact many urban areas are inundated with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>___________________________</p>
<p><br>
No doubt they (Mexicans)  are by now spread throughout the country. No argument from me.  I have seen that myself in towns in Minnesota and Wisconsin.   But how about the Cubans who infest  Miami? The Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in Orlando?</p>
<p>I live in NY City and the Dominicans have absolutely taken over much of this city, within the past  thirty years, displacing even the Puerto Ricans (who are now long-established).  The same is true in towns in Massachussets, Connecticicul, New Jersey, even reaching into small towns in formerly all-white Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Dominicans! Dominicans everywhere. I read of some small town in Connecticut that has become completely Dominican. All of this within a mere 30 years! I have also heard them arrogantly  boast that they are going to take over and make all of this theirs. And they are doing so!</p>
<p>They only starting arriving in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s, passing at first as Puerto Ricans.  Americans didn&rsquo;t know the difference. Before that, we never saw a Dominican. We didn&rsquo;t know what a Dominican was. Now, they&rsquo;re everywhere throughout the NE. And, I understand, in Florida too,</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans were the original &#8220;foot in the door&#8221;, so to speak, later followed by Castro&rsquo;s Mariel Cubans and then by the much browner, more numerous, and more agressive Dominicans, Hondurans and such&hellip;.coming from that inexhaustible  baby factory, the fertile Caribbean.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t even count the non-Hispanic Jamaicans, other West Indians, and Haitians, who are also extremely numerous (and in Florida too). This is not simply a Mexican problem.</p>
<p>I agree with those posters who ask, &#8220;why  should  we have to choose either one?&#8221;.    We shouldn&rsquo;t!  But of the two, I&rsquo;d prefer the mestizos to the mulattos.  Mestizos are bad enough but mulattos are worse. The latter are like killer bees, aggressive and pushy, driving out all others before them.</p>
<p>  <i>&#8220;Orlando has the largest population of Puerto Ricans in Florida and their cultural impact on Central Florida is similar to that of the large Cuban population in South Florida.  <b>Orlando is home to the fastest growing Puerto Rican community in the country.  Orlando also has a large and growing West Indian and Jamaican population.&#8221; </b></i> Wikipedia</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re telling us  this is a  Mexican problem?  Sorry, not where I live.</p>

		<p>The sad part is how these people just do not understand that it is the presence of the White Race that makes America so great.<br>
They seem to think it is just our location?<br>
Without the leadership of the White Race they will soon just have duplicated what they ran away from.<br>
Whites survive and thrive anyplace on the planet, and there is a reason for this but these invaders and We Needs Hep folks might never fully understand that.<br>
We had a Constitution which made us the Crown Jewel of the Planet Earth but it seems as if everyday a piece of it is just tossed into the trash.<br>

		<p>Empires come and go in the scheme of things and I wouldn&rsquo;t expect this country to be any different but it seems that we&rsquo;ve lasted a shorter time than any other in history.  It seems that our decline can be traced to the 60s counter culture.  I don&rsquo;t understand what would possess many of the children of the greatest generation, living in a free, prosperous, Western society, in their time the greatest nation in the world, to steer this country on a course for disaster.  &#8220;Civil rights&#8221;, free love, radical feminism, rampant drug use, militant homosexuality and other leftist thinking are the nails in the coffin for America.  Perhaps it was their parents fault.  Maybe they succumbed to WWII propaganda about people being boiled down into soap and human skin lampshades and soaked in ideas that preserving bloodlines were evil and traditionalism was antiquated. Perhaps their children just grew soft and corrupted by easy living.  </p>

		<p>Poster #18 mentioned something that I would like a &#8216;social justice&rsquo; multicultural advocate to answer.</p>
<p>I also have found that in the last ten years, latinos have literally taken over the local, very large and very beautiful park.  </p>
<p>Ten years ago you hardly saw any latinos anywhere.  Now, when I have tried to take my children to the park, each time the literal hoards of mexicans have looked at us as if we were dirt.  The angry, spiteful stares, the menacing body language, the occassional catcalls.  </p>
<p>Crime has gone way up.  The noise and litter are off the charts.  The latinos literally come in groups of 40-50 each, sectioning off large areas of the open areas and have big cookouts, soccer games and volleyball games.  They blare their salsa music at ear spliting decibals and throw garbage on the ground as if it were meant to be.</p>
<p>I know many nice latinos, just like everyone else here, but they tend to be whiter in variety, and less straight up amerindian.  It&rsquo;s the amerindians who are the underclass in latin american with mestizos above them and actual whites on top, but it&rsquo;s mostly the bottom two groups who are coming here and bringing their latino-ghetto ways.</p>
<p>To the social justice advocate: is it social justice when an outsider comes into my neighborhood and pushes me out?  If you say I must accept the inevitable change, then would you also counsel the people of Tibet to accept the Chinese immigrants and get over it?</p>
<p>As a white person, that park is now off-limits to me and mine.</p>

		<p>Mexican (and Central American) gangs far outstrip Black ones in terms of total violence and sophistication of crime.  They are the ones who -control- the drug pipeline which means they have an innate understanding of long range planning as logistics.</p>
<p>Blacks, by and large, do not.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mexican politics may seem slower and more violently corrupt but they are never as blatantly inept as black politics.  In Mexico, one simply steals power by creating gratitude for services rendered as a form of engineered dependence at a higher level of privilege than &#8216;the jobs we won&rsquo;t do&rsquo;.  Because it is those elites-helping-elites who provide the real cohesion of a working infrastructure model around which greed pays and the people groan but accept the services anyway.</p>
<p>Failing to see this is particularly dangerous for whites who are pathetically grateful for being saved from having to come up with alternatives to disenfranchising themselves to blacks without giving away the entire game to foreign &#8216;helpers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe that the Mexicans are a better lot.  They are the best of Central America (or they wouldn&rsquo;t be building a southern wall of their own) but that is still a sorry state of existence as any check of a global corruption index map will show-</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/bF41" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/bF41</a></p>
<p>America, _in spite of_ blacks, has a rating of around 7.  </p>
<p>Mexico, 4.</p>
<p>And Mexicans have oil.  They have cheap, foreign supplied, industry.  They have agro.  Yet still they come here to escape the depredations of their government and their DTO warlords.</p>
<p>We need a separation movment and we need it NOW.  The sooner we get going.  The sooner other White Americans will have something to point to and say: &#8220;See, that&rsquo;s what we can do when we are left alone!  That&rsquo;s what we want!&#8221;.</p>
<p>And that in turn is what will bring other states onboard to save as much as possible from our former country.  A nation is a people.  But the wealth of the people comes from the variety of landed resources they can develop and maintain self-sufficiency from.</p>
<p>It DOES NOT COME from &#8216;globalization&rsquo; as the effort to sell the most to the least at a mass consumerist profit margin.</p>

		<p>I agree with poster #24 Jay.<br>
Not only do they take over parks. How about our beautiful beaches? You can hardly go to a beach in SoCal or Chicago without being overwhelmed by Mexicans. I also disagree with posters who accept Mexicans because they are &#8220;better than blacks&#8221;. So what? Would you rather lose your parks and beaches to Mexicans? How dumb is that? Whites are losing their country to non whites no matter if they are black or Mexican.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s often assumed by posters on AR that &ldquo;Hispanics&rdquo; means mestizos from Mexico.<br>
While this casual assumption may apply in California and much of the West, the same formula doesn&rsquo;t necessarily apply elsewhere.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Here in the northwest (Washington state) we have plenty of Mexicans, but  also many South Americans of various Hispanic ethnicities such as Guatemalans, El Salvadorians, Colombians, etc. that got here by  crossing Mexico, but they are not Mexicans. It is rare, though not unheard of, to meet Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans or other Caribbean Hispanics here.<br>
Blacks need to wake up to the fact that these Spanish speaking invaders hate them, and furthermore, have no fear of them. Hispanics will not back down and let blacks continue to take over like White people have been doing for decades. I disagree with &ldquo;Ole White Missus&rdquo;. Hispanics are as bad as, if not worse than blacks. The best thing the Black community can do for itself is to shape up, and band together with White Americans to take back our country. We can sort out our differences among ourselves once we have the borders secured against foreign invaders.</p>

		<p>I live in a beautiful area of NYC  &mdash;  near the Mayor&rsquo;s mansion. We have a gorgeous, clean and safe park there. Of course, the hispanic population has literally gone mad in our city. I wonder when they will grab our park. Last summer a huge group of mulims came to the park every night and ate, and ate&hellip;and ate, and sat forever. They took up a huge area. We were not happy. There&rsquo;s a black/hispanic park some blocks up from us. In the summer it is total chaos. I pray they stay there. </p>

		<p>As Sam said above, Hispanics (and most other non-whites) tend to come in large groups, not as individuals or small groups or small families. <br>
 <br>
Wherever they go   &mdash;   whether it&rsquo;s to a park, a pool, a beach, they arrive &#8216;en masse&rsquo; and just TAKE OVER, driving everyone else out with their blasting noise, their squalor, their unruly kids, their litter. They make themselves obnoxious.  Then, when you flee, they call you prejudiced!</p>
