<h1>Civil War Marker May Be Moved Off MLK Drive</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Megan Matteucci, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, April 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Concerns by the NAACP may cause the Georgia Historical Society to move a Civil War marker off Martin Luther King Jr. Drive  &mdash;  despite it being cemented in the ground.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Historical Society unveiled a new marker to commemorate the burning and destruction of Atlanta as part of the state&rsquo;s 150th anniversary of the Civil War. The marker was installed in front of the Georgia Freight Railroad Depot on MLK Drive.</p>
<p>Last week, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People felt the location of the marker  &mdash;  the heart of the city&rsquo;s civil rights district  &mdash;  was not appropriate.</p>
<p>On Monday, Society President W. Todd Groce said he reached out to the NAACP after reading the AJC&rsquo;s story and is considering moving the marker.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is some disagreement and we&rsquo;re trying to figure out what is the right spot,&#8221; Groce said. &#8220;But historians said this is the place where the burning began. For right now, it&rsquo;s here. It&rsquo;s in poured concrete, but we&rsquo;re open to discussion about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Groce said the location was chosen based on historical accuracy and &#8220;no one thought about the actual street address&#8221; when MLK was chosen.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no marker to tell about the burning of Atlanta, which marked the end of the war,&#8221; Groce said. &#8220;We are standing on Ground Zero. This is where the burning and destruction started.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Georgia has allocated $380,565 this year for activities commemorating the war&rsquo;s sesquicentennial. About $80,000 of that will go to the Georgia Historical Society to install 13 new historical markers and replace seven damages ones. The new markers highlight historical events that included African Americans, women and the home front, topics previously neglected, Groce said.<br>

		<p>&#8220;The location of the marker was not appropiate&hellip;&#8221;<br>
I`m gonna take a chance and tie this in with my fence and neighbor. He told me he didn`t like it and wanted me to take it down. My answer was, &#8220;Then why did you move in next door?!?!&#8221;<br>
So what I`m saying is, maybe the marker is new but I`ll bet it was put there because that`s where it happened. In front of the railroad depot 100 years before MLK and 150 years before the busybodies&hellip;</p>

<p>What  &mdash;   no markers to commemorate the contributions to the Civil War by gays, lesbians, transgenders, Native-American spiritualist, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islander, the handicapped, Muslims, or caloric-challenged persons?  Oh the humanity!  When will the hate end!  How long must we continue to ignore the sacrifice of diverse peoples and to the Civil War?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see why the NAACP is so upset.  After all, they needed such war crimes as the one Sherman committed in order to get their precious &#8220;civil rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an aside, the only house that Sherman ever owned, in the northern half of the city of St. Louis, is now and has been for a long time in the heart of an unlivable black ghetto.  The cemetery in which he is buried is really risky to visit, even in the day time   &mdash;   It too is in the black section of St. Louis.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s American history, get over it. If they had their way they would re-write all of our history books and slander any President post-1861. History is history, not a subject for feel-good, kumbiya playing hand-holding discussions, it is the truth, good or bad it&rsquo;s THE TRUTH! Learn it and learn from it.</p>

		<p>The NAACP?  Who are they kidding?  The Civil War (the War of Northern Aggression) was fought partly because certain individuals in the North wanted to destroy the Southern &#8220;peculiar institution.&#8221;  Blacks were freed during the Civil War   &mdash;   so what are they complaining about NOW???  One would think they&rsquo;d have some GRATITUDE about that war   &mdash;   but, nope, they&rsquo;d rather whine&hellip;</p>

		<p>I read this story several times and I still do not understand. The Civil War was mainly about ending slavery and giving freedom to black slaves. Yet the ancestors of these slaves (NAACP) object to a marker commemorating one of the main events that won the war. I can&rsquo;t figure out how the placement of this marker could be offensive. Maybe I am just stupid, but it makes no sense to me at all.</p>

		<p>This item reveals a very interesting irony.  The Yankees burned Atlanta.  They defeated the Confederacy in war.  They freed the slaves.  The burning of Atlanta did  a great deal to help in the &#8220;advancement of colored people.&#8221;  Something the NAACP has done very little of.</p>

		<p>One cannot measure today&rsquo;s society by events that occurred more than 150 years ago.  It is history, we read about it, learn from it, and move on.  But, it seems, that blacks will never be able to move on.  They love living in the past, bringing up past injustices, and blaming Whites for all the ills in their pathetic society.  This is just one more politically correct opportunity for blacks to prove the Whites are just trying to &#8220;keep them down.&#8221;</p>

Martin Luther King JR Boulevard, Anytown USA, is usually among the most dangerous areas of a city.</p>
<p>Move the marker to a white community that will respect the memorial. This also has the added benefit of proclaiming the area as white.</p>

		<p>The Georgia Historical Society is run by a bunch of yankee liberals who get paid by rich Southern Whiteys who have figured out how to cash in on their White Privilege and enjoy going to cocktail parties at the country club and feeling important.</p>
<p>GHS is putting up markers all over Georgia that give the Reconstruction II view of our history, that is, the Civil Rights view that tells you that Whites are always wrong for slavery and defying the Federal Government.    These markers are very shrewdly written, and sadly, they will perpetuate the myths that still inspire hostile and dangerously anti-White environments. Any White schoolchild who reads these will find nothing of his great blood inheritance to be praised, and will quickly understand that his role as a good progressive is to &#8220;do more&#8221; to right the wrongs of our shameful past.   He&rsquo;ll see nothing of self-determination, courage, and heroism.  He&rsquo;ll be taught that resisting the Feds is racist hate against the poor, oppressed, marginalized, and always peaceful and angelic blacks who just want a good education so they can get a good job and work hard to support their wife and children and live out the American Dream while paying taxes and offering us their transformative leadership that inspires us all toward shared values.</p>
<p>The only folks you can count on to tell you the truth about these markers are the Sons of Confederate Veterans and a few of the feistier Daughters of the Confederacy.  </p>
<p>In more Atlanta news, today the radio was crowing about our surge in population within three miles of downtown because &#8220;young people are search for diversity and excitement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just wait till those Whiteys get a dose of the Diversity Treatment.   We look forward to all of them coming down with the White Nurse Syndrome: &#8220;I wasn&rsquo;t a racist before I started working here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whiteys how move Intown soon learn that they simply can&rsquo;t go out at night, and when they go out during the day, they should expect to come home to a robbed house.<br>

<p>What is the issue?  The burning of Atlanta was a significant historical event marking the near-end of the civil war.  The very war fought predominantly by whites at huge cost to free blacks.  This is offensive to MLK&rsquo;s memory?  This is a sham to assert power, it is not historically related in anyway to black civil rights other than the very core struggle to establish their freedom in this country.  Bizarre.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m amazed the people the NAACP represent haven&rsquo;t burned Atlanta to the ground yet. I used to feel shock at these stories but I&rsquo;ve since resigned to the fact that the NAACP and SPLC won&rsquo;t rest until every vestige of White civilization is eliminated from the face of the earth.</p>

		<p>Some people, apparently, never outgrow Infantile Narcissism (possibly because they never develop viable adult Brains).  They are, therefore, threatened by things which divert attention from themselves.</p>
<p>A more sensitive marker should replace the clearly irrelevant one marking the origin of a conflagration which destroyed a city.  What does The Burning of Atlanta have to do with Black Folks?</p>
<p>Replacing the current monument with one which states &#8220;PRISSY SLAPPED HERE&#8221; should highlight a moment during The Burning of Atlanta, more directly involving Black Folks (and Black Employment issues).  Too, considering that this incident was entirely fictional, it should be more in keeping with other great moments in Black History.</p>

		<p>The naacp is a prime example of demented minds, fertile with dementia, living off the fat of the land with time to try and conjure (think).</p>
<p>The only thing the naacp wants to do is rewrite all of white history, meanwhile rape and pillage the land of whitey.</p>
<p>In another twenty years the truth will be told in our schools how not one white man fought in the civil war (it was all black regiments), winning the day.  Then WWII will fall to the same rewrite&hellip;like tyson said, &#8220;just weak punk a.. white boys&#8221;.</p>
<p>And our politicans can even stand without backbones, an evolution anomaly for sure.</p>
