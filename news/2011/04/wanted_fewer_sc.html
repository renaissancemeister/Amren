			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Madison Park, CNN, April 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The test that all medical school applicants take could place greater emphasis on behavioral and social sciences, adding a new component and lengthening the test to seven hours, if proposed changes are accepted.</p>
<p>Members of the committee that proposed the changes to the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) say that this could help better identify applicants who have a greater understanding of behavioral and social factors that contribute to health problems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;What they learn in medical school are the ways social factors and behavior relate to health,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What medical faculty want them to know is something about individual behavior, group behavior, culture, motivation, sensory  &mdash;  that they come in with the basic vocabulary and understanding of the foundational knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>These proposals came after three years of outreach events and surveys, the gathering of advisory groups&rsquo; opinions and more than 2,700 responses from students, staff, administrators and medical residents.</p>
<p>&#8220;That kind of input caused us to say, we need to at least test some of the principles of sociology, psychology, statistics, so that students are preparing to be physicians and taking the coursework required to be that knowledgeable,&#8221; said Ronald D. Franks, M.D., vice-chair of the committee and vice president of health sciences at the University of South Alabama. &#8220;The purpose of the test helps identify those applicants who would be well-prepared of dealing with those aspects.&#8221;</p>
<p>This also pertains to diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It speaks to an awareness of cultures outside of the one they grew up in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to be more sensitive to those issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Schaeffer, public education director of the National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing and frequent critic of standardized exams, said the proposals are headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>{snip} &#8220;There is a growing perception because of the emphasis of MCAT in medical school admissions, you&rsquo;re getting science nerds  &mdash;  kids who are strong at mastering scientific facts, but are not so strong at dealing with patients, real human beings with real human problems, which have to be dealt with a broader array of disposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind of diversity they&rsquo;re looking for are intellectual, cultural, racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>As statistics indicate, students from lower economic backgrounds tend to score lower on MCATs, which are crucial in determining medical school admissions.</p>
<p>Of nearly 80,000 medical students in the U.S, about 7% are African American and 8% are of Hispanic descent in a country that is increasingly more diverse. Asians and whites comprise nearly 80 percent.</p>

		<p>Here in Sydney you do NOT have to wait at the clinics which are staffed by Asian, Indian, Pakistani or Iranian/Iraqi doctors.</p>
<p>If you want to see an Australian, British, South African or other European (Includes Greek and Irish) you generally need to make an appointment often some days in advance.</p>
<p>The only African Drs here (Very few) seem to be in public hospitals.</p>
<p>At &#8220;White&#8221; Drs surgeries I see lots of diversity in the waiting room, especially well to do Muslim and Indian patients!</p>
<p>Does this send out some sort of message about some supposed need for diversity training. I think NOT, we (and Minotities) need the the most knowledgeable and skillful doctors that it is possible to train. Not AA government employees.<br>

<p>lol, I can&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s the wording of the original article&hellip; Who ever wrote that will be spanked and sent to sensitivity training for sure, or sent to the Libyan office of CNN. Most viewers probably won&rsquo;t notice. Maybe there&rsquo;s the bonus that few minority groups will want to complain about this one for fear of drawing attention to it. I bet whatever CNN calls it&rsquo;s Orwellian &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; department will handle this one in-house. <br>

<p><i>&ldquo;The kind of diversity they&rsquo;re looking for are intellectual, cultural, racial.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Intellectual diversity? Really? People are looking for intellectual diversity?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;There is a growing perception because of the emphasis of MCAT in medical school admissions, you&rsquo;re getting science nerds &mdash; kids who are strong at mastering scientific facts </i></p>
<p>Again, who is pushing this &#8216;growing perception&rsquo;? This didn&rsquo;t come out of thin air. Someone saw a problem that wasn&rsquo;t there and is now promoting their theory.</p>
<p>How will placing less emphasis on facts make for better surgeons?<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t we already have enough of these &#8220;culturally IN-competent doctors as it is?  </p>
<p>Try finding a White American doctor in these HMO&rsquo;s, hospitals or anywhere for that matter. I WANT a doctor who looks like me and has the same &#8220;cultural&#8221; background that I have! I am sick of seeing &#8220;foreigners&#8221; pretending to care about my health, I am sick of not understanding a word they say, in their broken English dialect. </p>
<p>Segregation for Whites would sure solve a lot of our problems, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Let us work on that since our government has become the enemy of the White race in our own country.</p>

<p>Anything used nowadays that uses the word &#8220;social&#8221; is a dead ringer for skewing the facts or standards.</p>
<p>They can pump out as many blacks and hispanic doctors as they want, I won&rsquo;t go to them.  Not ever.</p>
<p>Is it because I&rsquo;m racist?  No.  Its because I want to wake up after the surgery and live.  I don&rsquo;t want someone, no matter what color, operating on me that got pushed through med school.</p>
<p>And since when are nerds bad in the medical field?  Nerds is just a code word for smart white kids.  I want a nerd, not some black guy with &#8220;swagger&#8221; that dresses like an Easter egg.</p>
<p>But hey, they did say that they were going to close the achievement gap.  In a &#8220;Harrison Bergeron&#8221; world they will just take blacks from inner city high schools and have them pick out of a hat for a job.  Whichever profession comes out of the hat, they are guaranteed to have no matter what.  Achievement gap closed.</p>

		<p>Ever since the university close to my home opened a med school, with an emphasis on Appalachian medicine, I&rsquo;ve been able to go to docs of my ethnocultural group and don&rsquo;t have to settle for foreign-born people with thick accents and little understanding of Americans in general, let alone hillbillies.  I would think that black folks would also like docs who think and talk like them, but for years I&rsquo;ve heard that they often don&rsquo;t hold black docs in very high regard.  And if anyone suggested such matchups, there would probably be complaints of being shortchanged  &mdash;  and, if med schools lower their standards, the complainers would probably be correct.</p>

		<p>The continuum between highly competent and dumber-than-a-brick is an example of diversity. The introduction of diversity into medical personnel, through silly standards, will result in a greater bias against darker staff members. No one wants incompetents fiddling with their bodies. This greater bias will manifest itself in blacks and whites alike.      </p>

		</legend>
		<p>Do you think medical schools really want classes filled with dumbed-down blacks? No. In private, any doctor will tell you that&rsquo;s a nightmare. Intelligence and scientific competence is prized. I should know. I&rsquo;ve been practicing medicine for over 20 years.</p>
<p>My medical school class (a midwestern university) had 5 blacks in a class of 165. Three dropped out for academic reasons. No whites left for academic reasons. My residency program had no blacks. There was one black resident in the hospital (internal medicine/pulmonology).</p>
<p>They - the med schools and the AAMC - are playing this game because of a fear they will lose government funding (follow the money - it&rsquo;s America). Buried in Obamacare are stipulations to get more blacks into medical schools and punish schools as well as academic research centers that fail to follow this PC effort.</p>
<p>Medicine is one of the few academic areas yet to be fully polluted by liberal idiots and affirmative action whiners. </p>
<p>Unlike law, for example, where a pre-law student can major in any field - like education or &#8220;black studies&#8221; and wind up with a 4.0 GPA - most blacks cannot make it through the required pre-med courses needed to simply apply (organic chemistry, calculus, physics&hellip;). Without those courses, and preferably an A in those courses, you can&rsquo;t even apply. That&rsquo;s why there are so few black doctors. </p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s obviously harder to shuck and jive your way through those courses - there&rsquo;s either a correct answer or a wrong answer. It is extremely difficult to call math or chemistry &#8220;racist&#8221; although they&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>What will happen now is that sooner or later they&rsquo;ll do away with required pre-med courses - saying they&rsquo;ll simply teach that material once you are in med school. Then they&rsquo;ll dumb down the medical boards (the USMLE) so blacks will pass and be able to obtain a license. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible situation. We really are living like Alice in Wonderland. I have no problem with looking at social or cultural competence in an applicant as long as the grades and MCAT scores meet the competitive standards. Even a difference in an overall of science GPA of an applicant from 3.8 to say 3.6 is not that big of a deal. But if you look at average black applicant science GPAs of 2.5 then you have a real problem.</p>
<p>What won&rsquo;t change is that every guilt-ridden or brainwashed liberal white pushing this policy will be the last person to ever go to a black doctor. They know much more than the average brainwashed white and understand they would literally be taking their lives into their hands when they show up to see Dr. Shaniqua. </p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m kidding? Look up Dr. Conrad Murray - Michael Jackson&rsquo;s esteemed physician. That is the future of American medicine.</p>

		<p>Everyone should google Patrick Chavis, the poster boy for affirmative action.  He got into med school with inferior grades while Bakke didn&rsquo;t get in with superior grades.  Many of his professors wanted him out but he cried discrimination and stayed on.  Too bad for the two women he killed.  He was a disgrace.  Lowered standards in schools.  Lowered standards in the medical profession.</p>

<p>What they&rsquo;re saying here is that you need nonwhites because only they are able to deal with patients with sensitivity and compassion. Which is not only enormously insulting to whites, but ignores the long-standing tradition of (white) medical practice of emphasizing &#8220;bedside manner&#8221; as a standard part of everyday training and practice.</p>

		<p>Comment from Australia,</p>
<p>Good on you mate! But I have to digress, Asian and Indian doctors are some of the best. In fact, at the offices of Asian Indian doctors I see long lines of highly affluent and wealthy people of all stripes including us Anglos ( Skips). Not that I need to score an extra brownie point mate, but the former President of the Australian Medical Association was an Indian Australian man by the name Mukesh Haikeriwal who is now the head of the World Medical Council - the highest Medical Authority body in the world. I&rsquo;ve met the bloke, seemed very bright and decent.</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/9LUDH</p>
<p>And, we have had an exceptional rotten egg from the subcontinent, some geezer by the name Dr Patel - Dr Death. The incompetent dolt was finally arrested for gross negligence. However, by and large Indian doctors are excellent and well trained.</p>

		<p>I am sorry, this is not a ruse. It is quite blatant. Why should a possible doctor be learning anything but what a doctor absolutely needs to know? Studying useless courses only increases fees and adds more study time to what is an already incredibly long degree.</p>
<p>You know, there used to be this thing called &#8220;Experience&#8221; whereby, working on the job would allow you to gain knowledge of the world around you. You don&rsquo;t need to learn this abstract knowledge via universities. This is a blatant &#8220;in your face&#8221; attempt to increase the stupidity of an already dumbed down system.</p>
<p>In all honesty, Doctors would gain all they really needed to know about &#8220;other cultures&#8221; via treating their patients and working around &#8220;other people&#8221;. The only REAL thing doctors need to learn while studying is how to be the most COMPETENT Doctor they can be who can give patients clear cut answers on HEALTH issues and provide surgery when needed, not have a great &#8220;culturally sensitive&#8221; bed side manner! </p>
<p>@9 </p>
<p>I am ecstatic that we still have doctors such as yourself that actually see the stupidity of all this &#8220;Diversity&#8221;. Although, I am inclined to think that you are in the majority among Doctors who think like this but are merely afraid to state it for fear of losing their work.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The kind of diversity they&rsquo;re looking for are intellectual, cultural, racial&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it begins&hellip;  The dumbing down of the med profession.  They&rsquo;ve already done it to the teaching profession.  It is so easy to pass the teaching tests now.  And I&rsquo;ve seen more than my fair share of &#8216;diverse&rsquo; teachers who know so little of their subject matter.  But they do talk a good &#8216;social justice&rsquo; talk and walk a good hate-whitey walk.  They&rsquo;re bringing &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; and a &#8216;unique&rsquo; perspective to the schools.  Even still, most non-whites continue to fail the tests, and so they&rsquo;ve created &#8216;alternative&rsquo; routes to teacher certification.</p>
<p>Just watch and wait and see how all of this is transfered to the medical profession.  </p>
<p>When you are 70, and being wheeled into the O.R. imagine your reaction when you look up and see Dr. Dequan Jackson looking down at you, with scalple in hand, and then Nurse Sheelanita puts the laughing gas over your mouth.

		<p>&#8220;lengthening the test&#8221; to seven hours is simply a means of reducing the medically relevant and intellectually scientific portion of the examination in order to lower the threshold for passing. I doubt that the American public, which enjoys by far the highest medical practice standards in the world, would stand for simply lowering the overall requirements of the exam to allow more minorities to pass.</p>
<p>Medicine has remained one of the few occupations in the US which has retained traditional educational and experience requirements for hiring, though it&rsquo;s probably true that a few minorities, as in engineering and certain other hard sciences, probably slip through at the bottom of the GPA curve.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased to be wheeled in for coronary or neuro-surgery and seeing a black African surgeon standing over me. He might be the best there is; he might also be at the wrong end of the bell-curve. </p>

		<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, let&rsquo;s recruit &#8220;diverse&#8221; aerospace engineers.  Withing a generation, flying will still be expensive and grossly inconvenient, but will also be extremely dangerous.  There was some talk a few years about rape hoaxer Crystal Magnum getting a college degree (did she finish?)  Who would willingly board an airliner she helped design?  What about the chemical industry?  Those nerds are too boring; we need more refinery fires and perhaps a good methylisocyanate leak like the one at Bhopal, India (American Union Carbide officials got the blame, but you can be sure it was local technicians who misused the equipment.)</p>
<p>Incompetent doctors are going to make medical care more expensive and harder to get - in absolute terms.  This is because when malpractice cases naturally increase as incompetent diversitoids start cutting on folks, the insurance rates all doctors will be forced to pay will rapidly escalate.  Many white and Oriental doctors will leave parts of the medical field like ob/gyn and invasive surgeries in favor of sports medicine, just to avoid the high insurance rates.  We&rsquo;ve been seeing this for several decades already, but the rate can only greatly increase.<br>

<p>1.  Who all is going south of d&rsquo;border (or as far as India) to get cheaper, more &#8216;caring&rsquo;, (delivered newspapers, massages and baths every day, one nurse per patient room) medical care if not cheapskate whites?</p>
<p>2.  Remember what Greenspan said about engineers&hellip;</p>
<p>3.  If there are massively fewer whites, there will be massively less need for white doctors&hellip;  The Elites, who are already a privileged few, will never suffer from HMO globetrotting in pursuit of &#8216;greater diversitude&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Dr. Jonah Odim got his medical degree from Yale, and he was surely admitted, and passed, for AA reasons.  He came to Winnipeg, Canada in 1994 and started doing open heart surgery on babies.  It was a disaster.  He never admitted any fault, was arrogant and over-confident and blamed everyone else but himself.  There was a big inquest about it that lasted several years.  He is still practicing somewhere in the US. God help his patients.  </p>

		<p>Ofcourse mate. I prefer white doctors over anyother ethnicity simply because I can relate to him or her. However, just to be fair, liking one doctor does not mean that the other is any less incompetent. In the field of medicine whether in the United States, UK or Australia, Indian Surgeons and MD&rsquo;s are some of the finest! </p>

		<p>&#8220;Everyone should google Patrick Chavis&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelle Malkin wrote an article about that. She wrote that those in the media made Patrick Chavis their affirmative action poster boy. Anyone who didn&rsquo;t think Chavis deserved a spot in med school was tarred as a bigot. When his license was taken away, not a peep was heard in these media outlets. They were too busy finding new bigots to expose, no doubt.</p>

		<p>So these Diversity-crazed social engineers want to lower the bar, <br>
and open the gates of the US medical profession to lower-intelligence and/or less-prepared members of home-grown minority groups on the left slopes of the Bell Curve. But all that such policies would accomplish would be to reduce even further the number of White US born and educated physicians. Ditto for Home-grown Asian &#8216;nerd&rsquo; docs. But it won&rsquo;t have any impact at all on the importation of foreign-educated doctors from the Orient, South Asia and the Middle East (save perhaps that these would all study mestizo Spanish before coming here). As usual, the schemes instigated by these White destroyers take us further away from the nation and culture we were   &mdash;  - but not necessarily in the directions the perpetrators presently foresee. </p>

<p>I think I might know a reason why blacks avoid black doctors.  Maybe a lot of black patients think that black doctors are fake.  I was once privy to a conversation where a black woman told another that when she goes to a hospital or clinic, she sees a lot of doctors.  But the only reason they were doctors is that people thought they were doctors.  That&rsquo;s what she wanted for her own daughter, to make people think she&rsquo;s a doctor.  In other words, in her worldview, there aren&rsquo;t doctors because they absorb 10-12 years of difficult post-secondary education and have proven their intelligence and ability, there is only the razzle-dazzle scam.</p>
<p>I know from reading the printed AR some time ago that a lot of blacks in Africa think that the medical diploma is a magic wand that confers on its owner the ability to heal diseases, so they think the trick is to getting the piece of paper.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t build a first world society with third world people and their third world mentalities.</p>

		<p>ozman,</p>
<p>You really don&rsquo;t get it do you?  This isn&rsquo;t about choosing a Doctor because you can understand them better, it&rsquo;s about saving your own Race and Culture.</p>
<p>It sounds as though you would be perfectly happy to have Non-Whites in all the top positions while Whitey is stuck with all the entry level jobs or no jobs at all.  Why?  Do you really believe they will be good to you once they are the Majority?</p>
<p>The fact is oz, even those Non-Whites who appear to be Law Abiding actually are not.  They not only favor their own but they immigrate to your Country, take from a system (Public Benefits) from which they never contributed to, take a job from one of your own and then, then they send money OUT of your Country Back to their own Countries which of course does nothing but support a Foreign Economy.  So much for their Love and Loyalty to their supposed new home eh?  Look up remittances because they do it here and I know they do it in your Country too. </p>
<p>Also, over here, indians are taking over every Industry we have.  From hotels/motels to Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts to Gas Stations to Medical to Technology to Politics and Law.  They are everywhere and please believe me when I tell you, this is a blatant &lsquo;in your face, dare you to do anything about it&rsquo; all out assault.  It&rsquo;s a take-over plain and simple.</p>
<p>Along with this Third World Immigrant take-over came Third World Quality and Third World Wages for us Americans.  The quality of everything across the board here has gone right down the toilet because of Third World immigrants and Treasonous &ldquo;americans&rdquo;.  </p>
<p>You are posting here in defense of the Extinction of Whites and I want to know why.  Are you really White and just Brainwashed and Blind or are you an indian?  A Traitor perhaps?  Who are you?</p>
<p>p.s.  I don&rsquo;t believe anyone has ever denied there are a few intelligent people in every race but those few need to be taking care of their own in their own Countries.  Please trust me when I tell you, they are not here or in Europe to benefit anyone except their selves and their own.  Take note of that because that is exactly what we are supposed to be doing too.  </p>
<p>Either get on board or get off.  We just don&rsquo;t have enough Resources to allow people like you to once again infest the White Race with your one or two Third World Immigrants which of course, always leads to three, four, five, ten, twenty&hellip;.and then, then they become CEO&rsquo;s and Business Owners and Heads and Governors like they are today and soon to be Ruling over us in every other arena.  </p>

		<p>Heard it all, seen it all. You are at the beginning of the road, we are close to the end of it. Whites dying in state hospitals. Wrong leg amputated. Black babies dying thru neglect. Witch doctors being accepted as medical personnel. different admission standards. Staggering medical aid costs an with less and less benefits. Emigration of medical personnel. The rest you can imagine yourself.</p>
<p>The worst is the denial of the whites. We are our own worst enemy.</p>

<p>Ofcourse I understand that and as I said before nothing would please me more than a good white doc. But, fact is many Indian docs are just as good and in some cases even better. Especially in the fields of Orthopedic, Cardio-Thoracic surgery and Endocrinology - they have some of the world&rsquo;s best. My young niece&rsquo;s heart surgeon was an American of East Indian heritage ( Dr Mohan Reddy- he is considered the world&rsquo;s best). What does choosing the best have to do with being a &#8220;race traitor&#8221;. I&rsquo;m a proud Aussie, and I also believe in investing in the best. If its cars I prefer European or Japanese as compared to American, if its countries, I avoid Asia and Africa because they don&rsquo;t compare to Europe and North America likewise with my choice of Physicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds as though you would be perfectly happy to have Non-Whites in all the top positions while Whitey is stuck with all the entry level jobs or no jobs at all. Why? Do you really believe they will be good to you once they are the Majority?&#8221;</p>
<p>Listen mate, you&rsquo;re putting words in my mouth - fair dinkum! I never said that. </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is oz, even those Non-Whites who appear to be Law Abiding actually are not. They not only favor their own but they immigrate to your Country, take from a system (Public Benefits) from which they never contributed to, take a job from one of your own and then, then they send money OUT of your Country Back to their own Countries which of course does nothing but support a Foreign Economy. So much for their Love and Loyalty to their supposed new home eh? Look up remittances because they do it here and I know they do it in your Country too.&#8221;</p>
<p>I generally don&rsquo;t like Indians and Chinese because they&rsquo;re alien and above all they tend to take over our businesses. Australia for Aussies. I would like nothing more than to restrict 3rd world immigration. They&rsquo;re parasites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, over here, indians are taking over every Industry we have. From hotels/motels to Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts to Gas Stations to Medical to Technology to Politics and Law. They are everywhere and please believe me when I tell you, this is a blatant &lsquo;in your face, dare you to do anything about it&rsquo; all out assault. It&rsquo;s a take-over plain and simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew those buggers run gas stations and hotels, but I&rsquo;m alarmed that they&rsquo;ve even entered politics and Law too! Really - thats crazy mate!</p>
<p>&#8220;Along with this Third World Immigrant take-over came Third World Quality and Third World Wages for us Americans. The quality of everything across the board here has gone right down the toilet because of Third World immigrants and Treasonous &ldquo;americans&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree. We had the Pauline Hanson. Too bad that oaf John Howard and his lackeys did nothing for so long.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are posting here in defense of the Extinction of Whites and I want to know why. Are you really White and just Brainwashed and Blind or are you an indian? A Traitor perhaps? Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok now I sense you&rsquo;re being uncivil. I am NOT defending non whites and neither do I want people of my species ( white Anglo-Saxons) to go extinct. That would be blatantly absurd. I was just trying top address the issue in terms of common sense.</p>
<p>p.s. I don&rsquo;t believe anyone has ever denied there are a few intelligent people in every race but those few need to be taking care of their own in their own Countries. Please trust me when I tell you, they are not here or in Europe to benefit anyone except their selves and their own.

		<p>Oz,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t put words in your mouth.  I said &#8220;it sounds as though&#8221;.  Look, I just don&rsquo;t see how the White Race can possibly survive when we have people who don&rsquo;t see the harm in choosing non-whites over Whites for any reason.</p>
<p>There are plenty of White Doctors who are just as if not more than capable than all the non-whites put together.  White People are very capable so I see no valid reason to patronize non-white anything.</p>
<p>Oz, when the Resources run thin, it won&rsquo;t be your asian doctors who help you. No non-white will help you but guess who will?  Stick to your own Oz.  Stick to your own..              </p>
<p>If I sound hard or &#8220;uncivil&#8221;, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m tired of White People defending non-whites and especially so when it&rsquo;s just so obvious what is going on.  Stop defending non-whites Oz!  </p>

		<p>Oh my.  Maybe it will get to be like in Dayton, Ohio.  The feds came in and made them change the test twice for fireman and policeman.  Now the only score they need on a test is an F and they will still get an interview for the job.  Never mind that both are required to write reports that are readable.  I worked with people like this and their written work could not be read because of poor writing skills and spelling.  What has this world come to?</p>

		<p>I love the dichotomy presented in this article. You can either have a white doctor with a bunch of &#8220;medical knowledge&#8221; or you can have a non-white &#8220;doctor&#8221; who is well-versed in the lingo of Political Correctness.</p>
