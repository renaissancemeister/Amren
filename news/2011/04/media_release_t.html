<h1>Media Release: To Be a Farmer More Dangerous Than to Be a Police Officer.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>African Crisis, April 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To be a farmer more dangerous than to be a police officer</p>
<p>The Equality Court in Johannesburg this afternoon learned it now is more dangerous to be a farmer in South Africa than being a member of the police.</p>
<p>This appears from the evidence of Prof. Christiaan Bezuidenhout, criminologist and expert on the influence of music on young people. Prof. Bezuidenhout was the first witness called by TAU SA in the case against Julius Malema and the ANC on the hate speech issue.</p>
<p>Prof. Bezuidenhout testified that farm murders actually should be a special category of crime. Murders committed on farms in South Africa is 700 times higher than the average in the rest of the world. &#8220;It&rsquo;s now more dangerous to be a farmer than to be a policeman,&#8221; said prof Bezuidenhout..</p>
<p>In 99% of the cases where a murder takes place on a farm production stops, and every farm murder cost the state R2 million. The risk to be killed on a farm is about 30 times higher than in any other part of the community. The attacks are furthermore extremely violent.</p>
<p>Referring to the song &#8220;Shoot the farmers&#8221;, Prof. Bezuidenhout testified that he regards it as an inflammatory song. Young people look up to Julius Malema as a role model, and therefore it affects young people&rsquo;s perceptions and he makes an impression on them.</p>
<p>Especially in violent communities people can easily be encouraged by such inflammatory music. In such communities role models play a bigger role. Songs that condone violence or scold people or groups as dogs can influence the youth so that they do not believe it is wrong even if they are not immediately turned to violence. Prof. Bezuidenhout said it is difficult to change the meaning of a song once it has been used in a certain context over a period of time. This is also applicable to the Malema song. This song is also not in line with reconciliation.</p>
<p>Prof. Bezuidenhout suggest that &#8220;the song should be placed somewhere in a museum where people can look or listen to it but it certainly does not belong in the public domain.&#8221;<br>

		<p>That is because it&rsquo;s genocide. <br>
Our brothers and sisters in South Africa are not only being ignored by the world media, they are also being wiped out! <br>
Western nations will gladly open their arms to dangerous 3rd world &lsquo;refugees&rsquo; but wouldn&rsquo;t possibly think of protecting their own people.  We will gladly attack nations for political oppression, but won&rsquo;t attack South Africa for genocide? I hope that some white nation gets enough sense to save these people before it&rsquo;s too late.<br>

		<p>Actually, being a farmer in the US is far more dangerous than being a police officer, which doesn&rsquo;t make it anywhere near the top of dangerous occupations.  The old saw that &#8220;they lay their lives on the line for us every day&#8221; is utter nonsense.</p>
<p>The US has more cops per capita than any other country in the world.  They&rsquo;re hardly overworked nor overstressed.</p>
<p>If I had to choose between cops and farmers in terms of who contributes vastly more to my well-being, health, and safety, the farmers win hands down.</p>

		<p>If the Boers are in danger in the Rainbow Nation, it must be their fault.  Blacks can do no wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no big fan of amnesty, but I would encourage the U.S. to give Boers and Rhodesians amnesty.  I have no problem with them being my neighbors.</p>
<p>Get out white South Africans!  No one will ever come to your aid.  As much as I wish we would (U.S.), we won&rsquo;t.  Not in time, anyways.</p>

<p>The story line originates in South Africa where over 3144 innocent White farmers have been slaughtered in the past 17 years.</p>
<p>In contrast, imagine a similar story where 3144 black farmers murdered the U.S., for example. </p>

<p> Although the evidence of Communist control of South Africa <br>
 was clear from the beginning since Oppenheimer placed<br>
 Nelson Mandela into power, the ANC will eventually crumble<br>
 within itself as black Communism advances.</p>
<p> As the world watches the bloody black savage crime waves,<br>
 the time has come for whites to coordinate efforts toward racial<br>
 unification.<br>
 If not through the internet, as neighbors, by coordinated <br>
 propahanda.</p>

		<p>I have been trying to learn how the end of apartheid in South Africa in 1994 effected the murder rate there. If anyone has data collected by a reputable source, please send me an e-mail letter with a link to the source.<br>
 <br>
According to Seventh United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, covering the period 1998 - 2000, South Africa currently has one of the highest murder rates in the world.<br>

		<p>It is worse than that. There is a higher chance of being killed on a South African farm than there was for an allied soldier between 1939-45.</p>
<p>This is a quite extraordinary statistic. If blacks were being killed by whites at this rate, it would be headline MSM news. But there is a media blackout because it is only whites being slaughtered.</p>
<p>How can the liberal-left live with themselves? This is racist genocide they are tacitly endorsing.</p>

		<p>It will take a little longer than Rhodesia but in the end the results will be the exact same. Dead whites. Starvation disease poverty among blacks that lead to dead blacks and dead black kids with pleas by white missionarys for more millions in aid or adoptions and begging for more billions in foreign aid from white nations. <br>
The black race is hopeless.</p>

		<p>A farmer works around a lot of dangerous machinery so they are at high risk.</p>
<p>Call a cop sometime and then wait the 40 minutes it takes him to get there, unless you reported two white boys riding on skate boards.</p>
<p>It seems to me as if the highest risk for these officers is Overdosing on Krispy Kremes?</p>

		<p>Actually, the most dangerous job in the US, last I looked, was Airline pilot, running neck and neck with Taxi driver. It&rsquo;s dangerous being a Taxi driver because blacks kill them. Taxi driver, another jobs whites just don&rsquo;t want to do.  </p>

<p>If its any help I believe there is ONE - yep one..! - black farmer in England.  He was in the news a couple of years back for that very fact. Ooops my mistake they found another..!</p>

		<p>When liberals scratch their heads and ask, &#8220;Why are Whites afraid of being a minority?&#8221;   &mdash;   reports like this are one answer. It is not that Whites have prejudice against blacks, or perhaps even are concerned over being pushed to the back of the line via affirmative action. It is because there is a distinct possibility of being the target of ethnic cleansing and mass murder. This has been the fate of too many minorities historically, and when you toss in the non-stop demonization of Whites by the multicult agitprop machine, there is real cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Yet I have found that no matter how much one brings up these points to liberals, they refuse to accept them. They have some heavy duty ideological delusions in place. Even when one of their own, such as Amy Biehl, is cut to pieces by a favored non-White group, they can not see the reality. </p>
<p>Well, as the man said, &#8220;Liberalism is the ideology of Western suicide.&#8221;</p>

		<p>To quote former conservative British Prime Minister John Major upon his defeat by the Labour Party: &#8220;When the curtain falls, it&rsquo;s time to leave the stage&#8221;.  Even Kenny Roger&rsquo;s Gambler echoed this sentiment: &#8220;You&rsquo;ve got to know when to hold &#8216;em, know when to fold &#8216;em, know when to walk away, and know when to run&#8221;.  I&rsquo;m afraid that it&rsquo;s hopeless for a white landowner to long remain in South Africa.  Best to evacuate to civilization while they can and leave the natural resources for an opportune time in the future.  As for the ANC and their ilk, it&rsquo;s for sure those stupid people won&rsquo;t have the ability or the wherewithal to utilize them, much less deplete them.  South African gold mine production is already off 60% from Apartheid days.  The red Chinese, however, are most likely laying plans even now to swoop in and claim these resources for their own.</p>
