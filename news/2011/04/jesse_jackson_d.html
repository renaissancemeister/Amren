<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An estimated 700,000 Americans died in the Civil War, one of the bloodiest times in our nation&rsquo;s history. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything quite measuring up in this day and age  &mdash;  but Jesse Jackson can.</p>
<p>On Thursday&rsquo;s &#8220;Martin Bashir&#8221; on MSNBC, Jackson, the founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, said the budget battle on the Republican side represents an effort to make the federal government &#8220;dysfunctional.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[T]his really is a Civil War fight,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;This is making the federal government dysfunctional on the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. {snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have those who believe in states&rsquo; rights and those who believe in a more perfect union,&#8221; he said. &#8220;States&rsquo; right are anti-civil rights, anti-workers&rsquo; right to bargain, anti-social justice, pro-rich and significantly insensitive to poor people  &mdash;  that was the great divide 150 years ago and it&rsquo;s the great divide today in the ideological sense.&#8221;<br>

		<p>&#8220;Jesse Jackson Declares Federal Budget Fight the American Civil War All Over Again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excellent example illustrating the inability of blacks to draw logical parallels between on thing and another, which is a trait of those incapable of thinking in abstract terms.</p>
<p>Another example is the black lady DC politician who declared that if the &#8220;The Republicans&#8221; shut the government down it will be like killing innocent civilians in war, or words to that effect.  No wonder these people never invented even the wheel or a written language.</p>
<p>People who understand how lacking the black mind in general is are not surprised by utterances such as these, nor were they surpised to hear another DC politician announce that if all the people of an island gathered on one side of it it would tip over like a raft.</p>
<p>The Japanese Minister was right when he said America will never be able to compete in the global community of the future, because it has too many blacks.</p>
<p>But, considering the sordid state of financial affairs and growing fractious tribes in the US the present make up of this country won&rsquo;t exist much longer, because break up will likely occur in the near future and the USA of today will NOT be the USA of tomorrow.</p>

		<p>Allow me to correct Amren&rsquo;s byline: People who support states&rsquo; rights are PRO-WHITE.</p>
<p>The federal government is anti-White (affirmative action, race quotas, diversity training, demonization of anything Whites do, providing unearned respect/money/jobs to non-Whites).</p>
<p>Therefore, the people that support states&rsquo; rights are merely reacting to the anti-White oppression of the federal government.</p>
<p>It is quite clear to anyone with half a brain that the federal government is largely the enemy of any White person.  The federal government is obviously anti-White.</p>

		<p>Jesse Jackson understands perfectly well that the overwhelming amount of tax money collected comes from whites.  And not only just in absolute numbers but as a percentage.  His entire career (and Obama&rsquo;s) has been spent trying to scrape money from whites however possible and give it to blacks.  Period.  </p>

		<p>But notice blacks are immigrating in large numbers to conservative states whose budgets have not been destroyed by left-wing policies and black-run governments. </p>
<p>Notice, also, that states with right-to-work laws have the lowest cost of living; a boon for poor black people.</p>
<p>Consider there are regions that are governed by black leftists who agree with &#8220;Rev&#8221; Jackson. Detroit, Gary, IN, and Oakland come to mind. How are black and poor folks faring in those regions?</p>

		<p>Of course, Jackson is nothing but a worn-out, &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; idiot who trots out the mantra of Jim Crow/Evil Southerner because he can&rsquo;t argue the issue in any other manner.  Anytime the usual suspects (like Jackson) do this, you know the cause he is attacking is righteous.</p>

		<p>Nice metaphors from Jesse Jackson.  Of course the Civil War was started and ended by whites.  And 99+% of those who died in the civil war were white as well.  But that aside. Jesse Jackson is a race-baiter whose personal fortune is based upon capitalizing on racial discord, even when it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  Of course he sees and seethes all events that may disadvantage is tribe through racial-colored glasses.  Central issues include the affordability of these programs as they are funded with mountains of debt, an aging and beleaguered taxpayer base, and that many of the programs breed dependency in a world where the US can no longer afford slipping in competitiveness.  The times they are a changing&hellip;<br>
Jesse Jackson is increasingly a dangerous distraction.  Poverty pimp, advocate or whatever, the money has run out and so with it goes the culture of handouts.  He gets notice because the MSM provides him with it, even though he is an anachronism from a by-gone era.  A media anointed spokesman for things black.<br>
Message to Jesse, blaming whites is so 20th century.  In the 21st century the new threat to American blacks&rsquo; economic and aspirations (demands) is coming from Asians and Hispanics.  And those groups are not encumbered with the permissive and self-defeating altruism that whites have allotted blacks.  Said another way, they don&rsquo;t give a damn and those people of color will make your arguments fade into obscurity.  </p>

		<p>Notice how extreme their rhetoric is getting?  It&rsquo;s not just &#8220;racist&#8221; it&rsquo;s another Civil War.  Tightened budgets somehow are to kill thousands of children or my personal favorite&hellip;..be sure to call any reduction in the budget &#8220;extreme&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is it me, or is the liberal rhetoric, breaking down.  No one believes them so they ramp up the hysteria of what they are saying&hellip;.which only makes them sound delusional.</p>
<p>The race card no longer works.  Neither do a lot of liberal manipulations.  How bad is it?  Well, I notice that recently, someone programmed a traffic sign to say &#8220;God hates n******&#8221;.  Where was Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Obama?  Where was the mainstream media going bananas 24/7.  Nowhere&hellip;..why?  Because the race card doesn&rsquo;t work.  Had they put it out there, far more people would have gone, hahahahha, that&rsquo;s hilarious than, oh, my goodness, that&rsquo;s racist&hellip;.something must be done.</p>
<p>Might have been interesting to see that happen.  Even more interesting would be to see how effective the &#8220;Rainbow Push&#8221; foundation has been lately.</p>

		<p>Jesse Jackson, as well as all non-whites are in for one heck of a wake up call within a few short months.  All this talk of &#8220;balancing the budget&#8221; and conflict between federal and state agencies, is all so much smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>Here is the hard fact.  Within only the 8 day period where Obama and Boehner were bitterly negotiating that 38.5 billion cut for the rest of the year, the national debt jumped 54.1 billion.  54 billion in 8 days.  Any serious attempt to save the government would be looking to cut discretionary spending by 75% to 90%.  Ending all foreign aid and wars.  Cutting welfare to only the bare minimum to survive (which is to say, cutting the 90% of it that goes to Mexico as drug profits).</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/3mghzsq</p>
<p>What does that mean in REAL terms.  It means in real terms that no matter what Congress might decide to cut, it&rsquo;s only a drop in the bucket and at the rate only interest is piling up, not to mention spending, the national debt, within a very short period is going to outstrip the ability of the federal government to pay.  In short, it&rsquo;s no longer functional.  Not at some nebulous time in the future.  But right now.  It&rsquo;s a phantom entity without any ability to govern because it has no ability to pay for anything&hellip;.right now.</p>
<p>There IS NO FEDERAL government.  Only state and local governments.  And they realize this.  They expect any day now for the federal government to admit insolvency, close down, Congress, the Supreme Court and the White House, turn off the lights and return to their home states.  Obama is President of nothing as the US defaults on its national debt.</p>
<p>There are two types of states.  Those preparing for a post federal system where their local taxes only pay for everything and those that will stay in denial into the very last second and may dissolve into anarchy.  You can tell who is who from two observations.  One is the census map.  About half the US is mostly white.  That&rsquo;s the half that will remain functional.  The south west is Hispanic and the south east is black.  Those areas, the welfare is about to run out and there will be mass white flight as the consequences happen.</p>
<p>Nobody has any plans to continue to pay drug criminals for their livelihood.  And I suspect Jesse Jackson will soon clamp his mouth firmly shut&hellip;&hellip;he doesn&rsquo;t live anywhere near the black area, after all.  None of the liberals do.</p>
<p>And you won&rsquo;t hear anything about anything from the white liberals either.  Rule number one of liberalism is &#8220;not with MY money&#8221;.  The system by which you steal other people&rsquo;s money to pay for liberal insanity just doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.  Obama literally spent it out of existence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be 20 years before we can look back and say if that was a good or bad thing.</p>

		<p>Late breaking news on the budget deal:  Wonder why Boehner caved in so quickly and over so few concessions from the Democrats?  Other than the irrational fear of the politics of a government &#8220;shutdown.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Answer:  The Democrats conceded on the D.C. school voucher program, i.e. bringing it back.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  Boehner caved on the amount of cuts (less than the total increase of the deficit in the week and a day they were negotiating), funding for Planned Parenthood (in spite of the Hyde Amendment, any contribution public or private to P.P. is a fungible back door contribution to aborticide), and what not, just so black idiots could mess up D.C.&rsquo;s private schools just like they did its public schools.</p>

		<p>The thing we might ask is <i>why</i>  are there so many people dependent upon the federal government in the first place?  Especially after the federal government has implemented a couple of generations of war on poverty, federalized education, affirmative action, minority grants, Head Starts, VISTA, and so forth and so on and et cetera. </p>
<p>One answer is that by undermining state and local governments, the federal government has wrecked much of the capacity for local self-sufficiency, as well as creating a client class of recipients of public largess  &mdash;  not to mention the expanding numbers of bureaucrats required to administer the redistributions.  One wonders if Jackson&rsquo;s real agenda here is to defend the interests of the federal bureaucracy?</p>
<p>Another point to consider is that as long as there are tens of millions of people dependent upon the government for their sustenance, there is an audience for the race hustlers who play off blacks against whites, poor against middle class, immigrant against citizen. If the federal government slashed the budgets and people were forced to build their own economic power, then this audience would evaporate.</p>
<p>One suspects that Jackson is looking after his own interests and perhaps feels in the coming &#8220;Civil War&#8221; he will be the one who is going to be reconstructed. </p>

		<p>With all that&rsquo;s been wasted on &#8220;The War On Poverty&#8221; since 1964 (welfare, foodstamps, Section 8 housing, medicaid, free legal counsel, etc.), blacks have gotten way more than their 40 acres and a mule. More like 80 acres and a few horses. What it comes down to is they owe White America more than they could ever pay back.</p>
