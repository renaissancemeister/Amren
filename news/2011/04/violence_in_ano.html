	<p><strong>[Editor&rsquo;s note: the following video is extremely disturbing and should not be viewed by the faint-hearted.]</strong></p>
<p>Here is another fine example of the trend of violence in fast food restaurants. Two black females beating the hell out of a white patron, while several black employees stand by and watch. One black male manages to provide the facade of assistance to the white victim in this brutal attack.</p>
<p>The two black females exit, then re-enter the store to continue the beating, until an older white woman attempts to stop them from dragging the white victim outside into the parking lot. Note: the black male employees have disappeared from camera view, even though they are plenty well capable of stopping the attack.</p>
<p>At the end, the white victim is beaten until she has a seizure, at which point the camera operator warns the black female attackers to flee, because the police are on the way. Note: he makes sure to repeatedly tell the criminal attackers to flee, instead of keeping them there for the police to apprehend.</p>

						<p><big><strong>Was it a hate crime? Girl beaten until she has a seizure over using a bathroom at McDonald&rsquo;s &#8216;is a transgender woman&rsquo;</strong></big></p>
<p>By Paul Bentley</p>
<p><em>Daily Mail</em> (London), 23rd April 2011</p>
<p>•	McDonald&rsquo;s says incident is &#8216;disturbing and troubling&rsquo; <br>
•	<br>
•	Police consider charging black girls with racist hate crime<br>
•	<br>
The victim brutally beaten to the point of having a seizure in McDonald&rsquo;s as staff passively watched on is believed to be a transgender woman, it has been revealed. </p>
<p>Shocking footage captured the horrifying assault as McDonald&rsquo;s staff in Rosedale, Baltimore, idly stood by.  The assault, which happened on April 18, was so severe the 22-year-old victim had a seizure in the restaurant.</p>
<p>The attack was believed to have been sparked after an argument over using a bathroom in the restaurant. </p>
<p>&#8216;It does appear that the victim was a transgender woman, and she was brutalized while people stood by and watched,&rsquo; Lisa Polyak, vice president of the board of directors for Equality Maryland, told the Baltimore Sun.</p>
<p>The LGBT group is now calling on police to investigate the attack as a hate crime. </p>
<p>During the brutal attack, which lasted for several minutes, the young white girl was repeatedly kicked in the head and stamped on by two black girls in the fast food store.</p>
<p>Staff stood by and even laughed as the attackers grabbed the girl&rsquo;s hair and dragged her across the floor.</p>
<p>After shocking footage of the assault spread across the internet, with one site alone receiving 450,000 views by mid-afternoon, police said a 14-year-old girl had been charged as a juvenile, while charges were pending against an 18-year-old woman. </p>
<p>While the incident remains under investigation, local police told the Baltimore Sun they were looking into whether or not there was racist motivation.</p>
<p>State&rsquo;s Attorney Scott D. Shellenberger said hate crime charges were being considered.</p>
<p>&#8216;If there is evidence that the crime was racially motivated, we will take a look at those charges and see if we meet those elements. We have the ability, if the facts are there, to upgrade the charges at a later date,&rsquo; Shellenberger said.</p>
<p>Police said the woman had suffered cuts to her mouth and face but was in &#8216;fair&rsquo; condition.</p>
<p>According to a police report, one of the suspects said that the fight was &#8216;with a woman over using a bathroom&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The horrifying video of the attack shows the black girls repeatedly punching, kicking and stamping on the victim before briefly leaving the store. </p>
<p>The girl manages to get up briefly before they return, again punching and kicking her to the floor.</p>
<p>At one point they try to drag the victim outside to the parking lot  &mdash;  and it takes the intervention of an old woman eating in the store to stop them.</p>
<p>After threatening to hit the older woman as well, the girls continue heavily pounding the victim, until, bleeding, she starts to have a seizure by the front door of the restaurant. </p>
<p>The attackers are warned by an employee to flee before authorities are finally called as onlookers realise that &#8216;she needs help right now&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While one member of staff makes a half-hearted attempt to stop the attack  &mdash;  occasionally shouting &#8216;stop&rsquo; at the girl  &mdash;  the rest idly stand by, watching the assault indifferently.</p>
<p>The video was taken by McDonald&rsquo;s worker Vernon Hackett, according to The Smoking Gun.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vernon Hackett.jpg" src="/news/2011/04/23/Vernon_20Hackett.jpg" width="233" height="325" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></span><br>
     <strong>Vernon Hackett</strong></p>
<p>Hackett, who has worked at McDonald&rsquo;s in Rosedale since September 2009, claimed credit for the video on his Facebook account, which he has since taken down.</p>
<p>At one point the employee can be heard laughing hysterically at the violence in front of him.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s have slammed the incident as &#8216;unacceptable, disturbing and troubling&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The video emerged yesterday on music website worldstarhiphop.com and has sparked fierce debate about the inaction of the McDonald&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>One visitor to the site last night commented: &#8216;Where the heck were the employees? This is crazy and sad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another added: &#8216;Worst management ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On another site, a viewer wrote: The female &#8216;animals&rsquo; need to be apprehended, and charged with attempted murder &hellip;  the victim needs to sue McDonald&rsquo;s for everything they are worth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Others, however, argue that it would have been dangerous for the employees to have intervened.</p>
<p>A spokesman for McDonald&rsquo;s said: &#8216;We are shocked by the video from a Baltimore franchised restaurant showing an assault. This incident is unacceptable, disturbing and troubling. </p>
<p>&#8216;Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and employees in our restaurants. We are working with the franchisee and the local authorities to investigate this matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mitchell McPherson, who owns the McDonald&rsquo;s franchise where the attack took place, told MailOnline: &#8216;I&rsquo;m as shocked and disturbed by this incident as anyone would be.  The behavior displayed in the video is unfathomable and reprehensible.  </p>
<p>&#8216;The safety of our customers is a top priority.  We know the police were called immediately, and we are thoroughly investigating this matter.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The warning is apropriate- I nearly threw up when I saw this, almost as much at the lack on help from the employees as from the monstrous beating this poor girl received. This one has been all over various blogs but nobody has any idea what-if indeed anything- started the attack. My guess is that the victim possibly bumped or in some way touched or brushed one of the attackers, it takes very little to make a black woman upset. Maybe all she did was flip her hair out of her face. </p>

		<p>White America   &mdash;   this video shows the future for your children and your grandchildren.  On birthdays and Christmas, you will spend perhaps hundreds of Dollars on electronic gadgets from China for your kids and grandkids. But you can make a much better gift by funding organizations like AmRen that seek to keep the future safe for our children and for our people.  We are being ethnically exterminated in our own country. </p>

		<p>The blacks will be given a community service award for courage in the line of duty by the Baltimore NAACP.</p>
<p>The White girl will be charged with a hate crime for not stepping out of the way fast enough to please DOJ Holder&rsquo;s &#8220;my people&#8221;.</p>
<p>This story will be gone by Sunday night, Easter.  Today is Good Friday.  As Jesus died for our sins, this White girl suffered a near death beating and seizure for our sins of Emancipation, Citizenship, Enfranchisement, Equality, Integration, Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, Diversity is our Strength, Interfaith Dialogue, Radical Hospitality, Anti-Racism Action, etc.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll forget her and her plight just as soon as gasoline goes up one more penny.  Obama will be re-elected, and you can expect these attacks to become so commonplace that they are no longer posted online.</p>

		<p>Yawn.  Why does this even make the news?  Typicality isn&rsquo;t news- it&rsquo;s the expected norm.    </p>
<p>If the White girl wants to get ahead in life, she should come out with a televised statement about how sorry she is for enraging these oppressed and marginalized minorities, and that she pledges herself to undergo a life-long audit of her unacknowledged biases against people of color. </p>
<p>If she did that, White evangelical and mission-minded, community enriching churches would compete against each other to pay her way to college based on her potential to bring loving compassion to a hurting world.  Through forgiving the blacks who try to kill us, we are healed from internalized racism that supports the power structures of capitalism and White Supremacy.</p>
<p>This could be the girl who brings a stop to hate through her forgiveness.  She must confess that her unearned White privilege was so justifiably offensive that the blacks were doing the right thing when they tried to beat her lily White skin into a deserved shade of black and blue. </p>
<p>Blacks cannot commit crimes against Whites.  What we call crime, they call &#8220;transformative diversity leadership.&#8221;   Your White skin is all the justification they need to beat you to a pulp.    Eric Holder gives them a pass- he said &#8220;his people&#8221; can&rsquo;t be charged with a hate crime.</p>
<p>Imagine the mess we&rsquo;ve made for ourselves- we imported the most dangerous kind of blacks to these shores, then gave them nonnegotiable, unrestricted freedoms, taught them how evil we&rsquo;ve been to them, then give them special treatment and preferences when they assault us.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Eve Carson&rsquo;s murderers get the death penalty?  <br>

		<p>Stories like this tend to die down quickly, even in the alternative press.  I want to know how the victim fares, and recovers.  What actually happened in the initial incident can be only half the story.  But AmRen is right:  I could only watch the first half of the video; that was my limit.</p>

		<p>YOUTUBE refused to show the attack, as they have also refused to do in the past on similar black on white attacks.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s time to leave Youtube and go to Liveleak, or Popmodal, but most especially Popmodal, which is a conservative alternative to Youtube.</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me to note the number of white apologists for these attacks and those who minimize or deny them.</p>
<p>There have been NUMEROUS black on white attacks just in the recent past, yet not one conservative radio show will give any real attention to them.  Some will report some of them, briefly, but the vast majority go unreported.</p>
<p>However, with the internet available everywhere now and so many ways to record these events, the truth seems to be squeaking through here and there, but, as I mentioned, the vast majority of these racial crimes go unreported to any great extent.</p>
<p>The only way whites are going to receive adequate protection is to protect themselves.</p>

		<p>I remember when OJ Simpson got off on two counts of murder.  The cheering of the blacks at work and the silence of everyone else.  Most blacks believe in the one bullet, one white infant line of thought.  They are the most uncivilized, racist and amoral group of &#8220;sapiens&#8221; on the planet.</p>
<p>Yes, I know what all you white conservatives would say:  don&rsquo;t judge the millions by the actions of the thousands.  I say water ALWAYS runs down hill unless dammed.  A still body of water proves nothing other than that body of water hasn&rsquo;t been let loose.<br>

		<p>If  &mdash;  and only if  &mdash;  these females are caught and brought to court, and have a jury trial, they may actually be punished. This happened in Baltimore County, not Baltimore City. Different thing. Baltimore County still has some white people picked for jury duty&hellip;not the case in Baltimore City, where these females would  &mdash;  almost 100% guarantee  &mdash;  walk.</p>

		<p>This is absolutely horrifying! Every time I think that africans cannot possibly sink any lower they go and prove that they have not even come close to hitting rock bottom. I guess McDonald&rsquo;s has really embraced that whole 365black propaganda campaign. I have friends that tease me for being paranoid about being around blacks. As a White woman, I feel that I&rsquo;m entirely justified in my fear of becoming a victim of this kind of predatory behavior. This video makes me feel that much better about having spent the time, money, and effort to learn how to defend myself and those I love. I wish this woman had done the same.</p>

		<p>If that victim survives, she should sue McDonald&rsquo;s until they bleed out of every orifice.</p>
<p>As for the rest of us, we should flood McDonald&rsquo;s corporate offices with emails and letters telling them we will NOT patronize McDonald&rsquo;s, we WILL warn everybody we know NOT to patronize McDonald&rsquo;s until McDonald&rsquo;s abandons their &#8220;365 Black&#8221; nonsense and make their establishments safe again and free from blacks.<br>

		<p>This barbaric behavior should lead to at least some action and not just talk and debate among Amren supporters and our friends. All of us, at the least, should write McDonald&rsquo;s and let the company know that they have lost our business.</p>
<p>In addition, we should express our distaste (no pun intended) at the whole 365 campaign - a sham if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>If this is how the restaurant chain treats its customers - by letting them get attacked by animals and have a store employee shuck on over to see what&rsquo;s up - then they can have their burgers. Furthermore, if these are the &#8220;guests&#8221; who are lovin&rsquo; it, they can have it.  </p>

<p>How long before all the follow-up headlines downplay the race attack with &#8220;unfortunate and isolated incident that had nothing to do with race&#8221;?   </p>
<p>Soon, probably by tonight, so that the narrative can change to neutral so that White families at Easter dinner won&rsquo;t feel its necessary to talk about this horror story and about how glad they are that no blacks are in the house with them.</p>
<p>Look for the spin that the White girl lying on the floor was faking her seizure as practice for an acting class, or because she had been told by Whites to always overplay any suffering so as to give her plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney more evidence into court when she sues McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The black girls will never be put on trial, in contrast to the Knoxville Horror perps.  They had a liberal judge protecting them, but the Obama-Holder regime won&rsquo;t want this story to be in the headlines during the election.  The girls will be told that if they plead guilty and avoid a lengthy, expensive, and embarrassing trial, they&rsquo;ll be given time served, community service, and a year&rsquo;s supply of new hair weaves.</p>
<p>The White girls must never be allowed to testify. McDonald&rsquo;s will agree and pay whatever settlement check it takes to make the story go away.   </p>
<p>The attack happened five days ago, and we still don&rsquo;t know the victim&rsquo;s name, and never will.<br>

Look for this event to accelerate the demise of free, open Internet.  The powers that be know how dangerous these images are to their success at keeping Whites in a state of cowering submission to the Diversity Treatment.</p>

		<p>Uh oh, McDonalds is where I catch up on internet news before going to work. My physical safety is purported to be assured by a sign on the wall defining this restaurant as a &#8216;Safe Place&rsquo;. The link is to the &#8216;Safe Place&rsquo; logo:</p>

<p>Saul Alinsky Rule Number Four:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White civil society (Alinsky&rsquo;s enemy) wants to be fair and is fair to a fault. We have prostrated ourselves and instituted countless laws against our own interests in the name of fairness. The flaw in Alinsky&rsquo;s Logic is that if you attack civil society&rsquo;s &#8216;book of rules&rsquo;, you might eventually win, and those rules might necessarily change. </p>
<p>In the meantime, it is probably best to keep working the heavy bag.</p>

		<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;ve worked in customer service for several years, and at least I was told by my superiors that if violence erupted on the store floor, never intervene and to contact security or another superior (if this was at a McDonald&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely they&rsquo;d have security there).  Intervention meant termination - company policy.  I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to risk my near minimum wage job if I knew somebody was surely being pummeled to death, though.</p>
<p>I would think at least one black employee out of presumably more than one there wouldn&rsquo;t have hesitated to overpower a white attacker assaulting a black person.  Should that be the case, I have a feeling the &#8220;intervene and you&rsquo;re fired&#8221; policy would be ignored should this occur.</p>

		<p>This is a reminder to all you white people that these are vicious people. Protect your family by having them keep their distance from them (blacks). Our courts and government are not going to protect you from them. These black females aren&rsquo;t going to do any time, you guys know that. If it was reverse (white on black), this would be an international incident with a possible life sentence. Remember, Eric Holder is working to support his people, not whites. </p>
<p>Whites need to learn to organise just like other races do. It&rsquo;s kind of sad that won&rsquo;t happen. It&rsquo;s kind of like whites just don&rsquo;t have any survival skills - unless it&rsquo;s something to do with money. </p>

		<p>The last report from the Baltimore Sun says there could be hate crime charges if it is determined that the attack was racially motivated. I was surprised the article mentioned the race of the attackers and the victim. Of course since the video has gone viral that detail can no longer be concealed. Thanks to the Internet we now have access to these stories that the MSM doesn&rsquo;t want us to know about. Hopefully more and more white people will be moved by stories like this to abandon the liberal fantasies about the joys of diversity and take appropriate measures to defend themselves and their families. </p>

		<p>  Notice that the black females know how to take a person down and pummel them. This is not the first time they&rsquo;ve done it. They live in a culture where fighting is a normal method of resolving disputes. White children are raised in a &#8216;zero tolerance&rsquo; environment that severely punishes not only physical aggression but also self-defense. They are also taught that blacks are like whites, except for being exploited. In fact, blacks are much more impulsive, violent, and vengeful. We need to teach our kids to defend themselves and that, when attacked by a black, it may well be a fight to the death.</p>

I warn my kids about black behavior all the time, especially if there is more than one of them together.  White liberals and other non whites would call me a racist and bigot, but they can shove it where the sun don&rsquo;t shine. I have any number of examples to prove my warning to them justifiable, and I WILL NOT send my kids out into the world deaf, dumb and blind about our so called wonderful diversity.

		<p>One Sunday morning in 1997 I was held up at gun point in Washington DC while jogging.<br>
Wearing shorts and a t-shirt I could never figure out <br>
why I was a target in the first place..after all, where could I possibly be carrying money to begin with?  But I was white, I was<br>
alone and that was reason enough. The most vivid memory of he event was that as I standing there the black church across the <br>
street let out. I remember several blacks walking out of church  and recognizing what was happening and smiling.<br>
 And this was in a city entirely supported by white taxpayer dollars.  I never forgot those smiles. And you shouldnt either.</p>

Lesson to all Whites, young and old, male and female:  learn how to defend yourself. Take at least one reliable friend with you into goblin territory. If you can&rsquo;t carry a firearm legally, find a legal non-lethal option, and keep it with you at all times. And never go to the ground if you can help it.It just turns you into a soccer ball.</p>

		<p>This is only get worse if we do not start standing up and protecting ourselves. Today at a pharmacy a loud fat African got in line behind me and started complaining out loud about having to wait. Her two fat male African friends were standing off to the side with their arms crossed. Another cashier came out and she continued her rant. It was obvious the cashiers were worried. The new cashier said &#8220;next&#8221; and I stated please let her go so she will shut up. You could have heard a pin drop. She started her black girl head twisting and telling who the hell I was. Her buddies stepped up and I lifted my shirt and placed my hand on my .45 Sig. I warned them that I do not miss. She left her goods on the counter and they took off. The point behind this story of bravado is simple: they freak when you stand up and can back it up. Get a gun, get the concealed permit, go to the range, be committed to protect yourself and stand up to them. If you do not you will be a victim and the possible subject of the next cell phone video! </p>

		<p>I will give this one piece of advice that you may or may not choose to follow?<br>
If a physical altercation in inevitable with blacks you must react in the most physical and violent manner you are capable of.</p>
<p>Each and every day blacks become more and more wicked in their thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>A black thinks it is their right to assault whites and even if the person they assaulted did not have a tongue I can promise you this the colored person will claim he was called the n word.</p>
<p>The most dangerous of the coloreds are the younger children 12 to 20 and the black female (even black males fear them)</p>
<p>Any time you are in a situation where there are two or more blacks you are at HIGH risk. They know the courts will set them free with little or no punishment and they will be on their merry way to harm some other innocent human being.</p>
<p>Blacks have the impression and feeling that ALL whites are afraid of them and until whites learn they have a legal right to defend themselves with almost all states now allowing non criminal citizens to go armed, this will not only continue it will get worse. </p>

		<p>I know everyone is playing up the racial aspect of the attack, but the attackers seem like experienced brawlers.  But since most Black criminals victimize other Blacks before they move on to Whites, I am sure these girls probably have beat up other Black girls too.  The reason I say they are experienced is because in most girl fight videos circulating on the Web, the fighters are rolling around on the ground and flailing at each the like two cats. However, these girls purposely sought to get the victim on the ground without going to the ground with her. That way they could kick and stomp her to a pulp.  Had these attackers had on heels or hard-sole shoes, the poor victim would be dead.  They&rsquo;ve definitely been in a fight or two before and are dangerous as hell, so I hope the police get them off the street.  Adding to the shame of all this is the male employees who let this happen&hellip;I hope the victim sues the hell out of McDonalds.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;Awake in Arkansas&#8221;, if you get all riled up over this, I also hope you&rsquo;re riled up over those White teenages in Florida who beat, tortured, and shot a White 15-year old to death.   Because chances are if you get assaulted or murdered, it will be by somebody who looks like you&hellip;</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t even imagine any other group of females from another race being like this or doing this. But I have NO PROBLEM AT ALL believing it from black females. Blacks are simply not like other races (ANY of them). They are wired differently. Black females are tough, vulgar, uncouth and are very &#8216;mannish&rsquo;. Females from other races are NOT like them. I was routinely appalled at the behaviour of black females I had to work with at my job. </p>

Apparently, the two black assailants were claiming that the white woman being beaten was transgendered and that she was rude to them when they tried to deny her access to the public restroom.  That&rsquo;s no excuse to beat her though.  There was also an elderly woman who tried to stop the beating, but one of the two assailants pushed her away and continued the attack.    </p>

I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of naive young people who are brainwashed into the belief that even the lowest-class blacks are just like everyone else, and these people will either learn better via the internet, or they will learn the hard way.<br>
White people should simply stay away from the underclass.  If you don&rsquo;t recognize what that is, stay away from all blacks possible.  I would never enter an establishment where a number of blacks is present, even if it was out in the middle of white hillbilly country.  One never knows what will set them off.  The white girl who was brutalized at McD&rsquo;s may not have even glanced at or touched a single one of her attackers.  Some black man might have given her the eye, enraging the black females.</p>

		<p>It used to be McDonalds never went out of business just because of bad business.  The only way one ever did was because of eminent domain, or something like that.  But for the last 15 or so years, there have been a spate of McDonalds closing because of bad business.  When you add too it racial hate crimes like these, plus the rising cost and decreasing quality of their &#8220;food,&#8221; then I think McDonalds is on the vestibule of a really big fall.</p>

<p>The key words there are &#8220;if it is determined.&#8221;  Who is responsible for doing the &#8220;determining?&#8221;  Local police, prosecutors, maybe state highway patrol, maybe FBI, U.S. Attorneys.  Since this happened near Baltimore, you can bet all of them are pro-black, so they&rsquo;ll all drag their heels looking for evidence of anti-white hate, which probably wouldn&rsquo;t take too much work if there is.  We don&rsquo;t have the power to subpoena witnesses, issue warrants, empanel grand and petit juries and file charges.  My prediction is if that if there are any hate crimes riders filed at all, the prosecutors will be doing this only as a throwaway item in plea bargaining.</p>
<p>41 Que:</p>
<p>I saw that story from FL, too.  (One of the four suspects looked Hispanic, BTW.)  Here&rsquo;s what I thought of when I read it:</p>
<p>When I was 15, (the age of this victim), I really couldn&rsquo;t grok why a lot of older people I knew, parents, preachers, ministers, and other similar people, kept saying that it was a bad idea for teenagers my age to be engaged in steady relationships with members the opposite sex, much less to the level of a romantic relationship.  I was allowed to date, but I was not allowed to date the same girl more than two dates in a row.  (I never even dated one twice in a row, because I knew that pushing the envelope of the rule so tightly would have meant the rules being tightened even further.)  The older I get, the smarter they all get, and stories like these confirm their wisdom.</p>
<p>Had this young man been lucky enough to have parents as strict as mine, he would still be alive today.</p>

		<p>I would not doubt that hate crime charges will now be filed since the victim is transgendered (if indeed this is the case)I personally do not care if the victim is gay, straight, bi, transgendered or whatever- nobody deserves to be beaten like this!</p>

		<p>This is just one man&rsquo;s opinion but it seems as if McDONALDS in particular seeks out the black customer and has little regard or respect for the white customer. Even the help is Very Black.<br>
If blacks are 12% of the population to my way of thinking there should be 8 blacks for every 50 employees to keep this diversity in balance. Check it out next time you go, this mix is NOT the case.<br>
Also I am offended by McDONALDS use of it&rsquo;s advertising to promote black male white female relationships. Such as the one where a black guy is feeding a giddy white girl french fries.</p>

Oh good! Now we will see swift action on the part of the cops and hate crime charges will surely be filed. The only way black attackers are ever brought to justice is when the victim is a member of another &#8220;aggrieved minority.&#8221; <br>
Assuming the report is true, what is our reaction going to be? Are we now going to say that if it was a transsexual, the crime is not so serious?  Or are we going to remember that there have been many, many white people who have been terrorized and murdered by blacks, and that the vast majority of these white people were not transsexuals? Transsexual or not, the victim is white, and it was a hate crime, not only against a transsexual, but against a white person. </p>

		<p>How many posters remember the incident a few years ago where a white man was waiting in line at a pizza parlor talking on his cellphone when he exchanged words with some black woman, i think because she had cut in line.  But she goes outside and comes back with some big black thug who sucker punches the white guy and then starts to kick and punch him. And as usual the white patrons there do nothing to help. I believe the owner did tell the guy to leave or he would call the cops. This was on the O&rsquo;Reilly show. White people have to stop acting like frightened sheep and fight back. </p>

<p>HERE IS ANOTHER &#8220;McDONALDS STORY FROM THIS WEEK:</p>

Dad who split up fight in McDonald&rsquo;s shot dead <br>
21/04/2011 <br>
 <br>
 A DAD-of-four who split up a fight in a McDonald&rsquo;s was shot dead moments after being told he wouldn&rsquo;t see the morning.</p>
<p>Raymond Mitchell a white man, 34, had only popped into the restaurant to buy a hot chocolate.</p>
<p>But he apparently caused offence after splitting up two black men fighting in the queue.</p>
<p>One of them, who had several gold teeth, shouted at Raymond: &ldquo;You are gonna die tonight, you are not gonna see the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thug is then said to have phoned an accomplice to fetch a gun, yelling into his mobile: &ldquo;Bring me that thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond left the 24-hour McDonald&rsquo;s but was chased into a cul-de-sac. The gun was then delivered and Mr Mitchell was beaten and pistol-whipped before being shot three times in an alley in Brixton, South London, at 6.50am on Sunday. Raymond, nicknamed Brown, was taken to hospital but died hours later.</p>
<p>One neighbour, who saw the shooting but was too terrified to be named, said: &ldquo;He was begging, literally begging for his life. I didn&rsquo;t dare look out my window in case they saw me. I heard them laughing and swearing at him, calling him a &lsquo;b***h&rsquo;. I heard them laughing afterwards as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond&rsquo;s partner, who asked not to be named, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrified. They&rsquo;re still out there and they&rsquo;ve not been caught. I&rsquo;ve been told how they were laughing, actually laughing after they beat him and shot him. How could anybody do something like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police are pretty sure this was NOT a Hate Crime, just because they were calling the victim &#8220;white mother ****r as they murdered him.</p>

		<p>The only reason this story will have any traction is because of the gay angle.  Gay rights activists will keep it alive, but the racial angle will die away and it will be just a misunderstanding about the bathroom.  (The noble black females were enraged that a man dressed as a woman went in the female bathroom&hellip;  Oh, the righteous women had no choice but to beat him/her to a pulp.)</p>
<p>I am so wary around black people these days, and not because of seeing videos like this.  Long before I ever knew such things went on, I saw black people doing beat downs, stealing with impunity and acting like psychos on drugs.  If I see any black man walking my way, I cross the street.</p>

<p>If this were 2 White females assaulting a Black there would have been a congressional hearing. McDonald&rsquo;s has not reported on previous assaults in their establishments. The only reason we have heard any noise is because DrudgeReport had a headline! McDonald&rsquo;s was forced to respond!</p>

My uncle was a victim, got murdered in cold blood over some silly confrontation. There&rsquo;s a reason whites are leaving Maryland in large numbers&hellip;it&rsquo;s one of the only states in the 2010 census to actually lose white population, (most had modest gains) </p>

		<p>As a law enforcement officer, the sheer viciousness of this attack tells me that there is something going on besides a &#8220;she cut in front of me in line&#8221; or a &#8220;let&rsquo;s jump on the White girl&#8221; kind of fight.  They were trying to kick and stomp this woman&rsquo;s head in and kept attacking her repeatedly. Most assault calls involving women, even black ones, are nothing as bad as this. My sources in Maryland are telling me that the victim was a transgender/transsexual and there was an &#8220;exposure of a male body part&#8221; in the women&rsquo;s restroom that set the attackers off. This has not been confirmed, but it would help explain the prolonged brutality of the attack. But as someone said already, it is obvious the girls are experienced fighters based on their tactics.</p>

		<p>It has come to light that that person being assaulted was in fact transgender and the two assailants 14 &amp; 18 year olds were trying to stop the victim from entering the females restroom.</p>
<p>They two assailants were clearly out of line and should be punished. You should also think about your reaction in a situation like that, seeing a transgender male going into he female restroom. How would you react?</p>

		<p>While we&rsquo;re on the subject of Baltimore:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/aUAJz" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/aUAJz</a></p>
<p>First off, I normally don&rsquo;t like using terms like &#8220;gun crime&#8221; and &#8220;gun criminal,&#8221; for reasons I&rsquo;m sure most of you can grok.  But I&rsquo;ll use them here just to keep my piece short.</p>
<p>I read this judge&rsquo;s ruling, and he seems to imply that the city council passed this gun criminal registry law, deliberately left a lot of details out, and left the details of compliance in the hands of the Baltimore P.D., and the P.D. deliberately is vague about who must comply and how one must comply, because the whole thing was meant to be vague, so that the cops can have a sword of Damocles to swing over the heads of the &#8220;stop snitching&#8221; crowd in order to extract some snitching out of them, i.e. tell what you know about Shaniqua found all full of holes lying out on the street corner, or you go up the river for not complying with the gun criminal registry ordinance.  (Conveniently, the cops get the move the goalposts on the gun criminal registry regulations.)  Ironically, the &#8220;stop snitching&#8221; movement started in Baltimore.</p>
<p>However, the judge made the right ruling, because you can&rsquo;t have vague laws.  The obvious remedy is that who/how will be fixed on the level of city ordinances by city council members.  However, I still think that even with a solid gun criminal registry law whose requirements are as plain as day, the cops will still have plenty of chances to use gun registry as part of a carrot/stick mechanism to get info.</p>

We now understand why this story didn&rsquo;t make headline news; it doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into the PC paradigm.</p>
<p>Blacks are said to be oppressed. Gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgeners are said to be oppressed. Two oppressed people should not be involved in a fight, they should be natural allies.</p>
<p>This story is likely to be kept out of public view as much as possible. The media doesn&rsquo;t want to portray blacks as &#8216;homophobic&rsquo;. Had it been a white woman, the media would have acknowledged it in some way; at least to acknowledge it as a vicious attack while down playing the racial aspects. As it is, it&rsquo;s too complex to fit into neat and well defined PC terms.</p>
<p>The black man who recorded the event justified the assualt by saying the lady was a dude. The GLBT community won&rsquo;t stand for this. How much traction and support they get is a big question. Reading on line comments, many people, white and black, don&rsquo;t like the idea of a man dressed as a woman using a womens restroom and see the attack as justified.</p>
<p>As I said before, what will be interesting is to see how it plays out. Gays will likely try to make an issue of it but they will likely have to do so without upsetting blacks and implying blacks are &#8216;homophobes&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There is statistical backing for this statement. Jared Taylor established in THE COLOR OF CRIME that &#8220;Blacks are an estimated 39 times more likely to commit a violent crime against a White than vice versa&hellip;&#8221; </p>
<p>Such evidence recalls black economist Walter E. Williams&rsquo; definition of &#8220;prejudice&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;What is prejudice?   Prejudice is making decisions on the basis of incomplete information &hellip; We all do that because we try to economize on information costs.  An example I give is if you&rsquo;re leaving a room and you see a full-grown tiger outside, what are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, most people would endeavor to leave the area in great dispatch &hellip; Well, why?  Is that decision based on detailed information about that particular tiger, or is it based on &hellip; how you&rsquo;ve seen other tigers behave &hellip; It&rsquo;s likely to be the latter &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A person who was not prejudiced or who did not economize on information costs &hellip; would have tried to establish whether the tiger was friendly or not.  Maybe he&rsquo;d pat him on the head &hellip; Only if the tiger behaved in a menacing fashion would he run.  But most people say, well the expected benefit of an additional unit of information about that tiger is probably less than the expected cost.  So they decide all I need to know is that it&rsquo;s a tiger.&#8221;  </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Likewise, reasonable whites, made aware of statistics on interracial crime, would conclude that &#8220;the expected benefit of an additional unit of information&#8221; about a particular black is &#8220;probably less than the expected cost.&#8221; &#8220;All I need to know,&#8221; they would day to themselves, is that that person is a black.  </p>
<p>A metaphorical pat-on-the-head test for capacity for violence will not seem worth the information cost.<br>

		<p>We can only hope that as more of these crimes occur, more white people will finally wake up to the fact that blacks can be extremely dangerous. Some posters have been saying on this website lately that these crimes seem to be getting worse since Obama was elected. If anything good comes from the Obama presidency, it might finally help to throw the white racism argument for black problems out the window. How racist can white people be if they would even consider voting for a black man? </p>
<p>After reading this story, I&rsquo;ve decided not to eat at McDonald&rsquo;s any more. If this is their response to a white customer being nearly beaten to death in one of their restaurants, they don&rsquo;t need any more white customers. If the victim is transsexual, we can hope for a hate crimes prosecution from that angle. Still, it&rsquo;s disturbing that had the victim been born female, there would be little hope of a hate crimes prosecution because of Holder&rsquo;s views on civil rights for white people.   </p>

		<p>I do think that what those Black girls did were totally terrible. It was uncalled for, but at the same time, I want people to know that not all Black girls/women are like that. There are quite a few of us who are very lady-like and would not dare to stoop so low as to what these two ladies have shown us all on this video. </p>
<p>My problem with the majority of Black females (not all) is that they can be very, very masculine when it comes to dominating. I really hope this does not change other races views on Black females. Trust me, we are not all like that. </p>
<p>For one, I&rsquo;m not out of shape like those two. I&rsquo;m only about 99 pounds. Secondly, I was taught at a young age to carry myself with respect and respect for others. It pains me when our women do things like this and give the rest of us a bad name. Terrible. </p>

<p>Do you have a link to that story? In any case his mistake was to intervene. Let blacks fight among themselves. Now if one of them had been white it would be another matter. Also I see it happened in Britain. These things could have been avoided had the British not let blacks settle in their island. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Brixton is the black part of London.</p>

I do not look at blacks unless to know them (then I treat them with kindness). As for strange blacks, I look by or through them. They do not exist. I do have eyes in the back of my head, though, and a sixth sense for when they&rsquo;re near. It&rsquo;s good to be vigilant. Keeps the senses alive&hellip;and I know for a fact now that it may one day save my life. </p>
<p>I used to trust. Now I fully realize that a good many third worlders have no investment in the white man&rsquo;s social compact. So they are kept at a stand-off distance. Though I will indeed lump some very nice people into this category who don&rsquo;t belong there, you know what? I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;d rather LIVE slightly prejudiced, than DIE a gruesome death as a liberally benighted fool.</p>

		<p>Now that it has come out that the victim had a curious eccentricity, and that particular lifestyle is protected under the Federal and many states&rsquo; hate crime statues, I think the racial angle is going to get lost and forgotten.</p>
<p>However, lawyers have a fancy phrase called &#8220;proximate causation,&#8221; or in layman&rsquo;s terms, the &#8220;but for&#8221; test.  I actually used it last week to explain why the Brian Stowe beating at Dodger Stadium was most likely a racial hate crime:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/0N4ZV" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/0N4ZV</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s apply the &#8220;but for&#8221; test here.  We know a white transsexual (biological man living as a woman) was brutally beaten by several black women.  The &#8220;but for&#8221; test asks this   &mdash;   Back out each possible factor, and &#8220;but for&#8221; that factor, which factor&rsquo;s absence means the event was least likely to occur?  But for the victim&rsquo;s race, or his/her TS/TG lifestyle?  </p>
<p>To ask it another way, was this assault less likely to occur if this were a black transsexual biological man living as an apparent black woman, or if this victim were a &#8220;normal, straight&#8221; white woman?  I&rsquo;ll entertain evidence and arguments to the contrary, but I hardly think this would have happened if it were the former, but if it were the latter, it still would have happened. </p>
<p>Even if authorities unearth evidence of anti-GLBTQ bias on the part of the suspects, I still think this was fundamentally a racial hate crime.</p>

		<p>Frequently see black attackers kicking the heads of their fallen victims. When we again have a competent US Attorney General it would be worth pursing that attackers found responsible for this type of action be leveled with attempted murder charges.</p>

&#8220;The only reason this story will have any traction is because of the gay angle&#8221;.</p>
<p>I agree.<br>
Homosexuality and its variations (conservative gays please don&rsquo;t grill me on that one) is seen as being an admirable cause, where as White advocacy has been deemed a cause that must be denied any sort of defendable identity by big business, the MSM and our politicians (who are all really one in the same).</p>
<p>&#8216;White girl gets beaten&rsquo;. <br>
Reaction: <br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s the youth of today, poverty, lack of morals, parents fault, a boy girl thing, limited education or workplace opportunities, TV, video games, poor diets, low self esteem, too high a self esteem&#8221; etc<br>
&hellip;.And basically every other possible excuse except the racial factor.   </p>
<p>&#8216;Gay/transgender gets beaten&rsquo;.<br>
Reaction:<br>
&#8220;Hate crime&#8221;!<br>
The racial anger this suppressed story has generated, is and will be re routed to being a &#8220;sexual lifestyle choice vs. ignorant conservative values&#8221;(as represented by violent black girls) argument. <br>
Genius really, because watch as we racially aware will back off, as who really wants to defend either side of this one? <br>
I know I&rsquo;m confused.</p>
<p>I suppose we could just keep it simple and just say &#8220;black on White violence is wrong&#8221;, and then crawl back into the shadows.<br>
 <br>
What this story really highlights is how much of a worry the &#8216;free internet&rsquo; must be to our elites and how there must be a constant battle/ dance/ balancing act with the MSM in firstly trying to suppress stories like this one, then having to spin the uncomfortable situation once it does break through into the public conscious whilst trying to stay relevant.</p>
<p>Disturbingly my local network &lsquo;news-a-tainment&rsquo; broadcast usually only proactively uses internet sources to quote from celebrity &lsquo;tweets&rsquo; and face book comments. <br>
Which feels like no-news created from nothing.<br>
Then they only seem to use these YouTube type of videos shot from cell phones after they&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;viral&rsquo; for at least 24hrs, as to jump on the popularity bandwagon. <br>

<p>A small number of Whites brought slaves to this country. None of the slave owners nor the slaves they brought is alive today. Those slaves were procured by enemy tribesmen through raids on villages. The slaves were then delivered to the Arab Muslim traders who then sold them to the slave brokers. Most of today&rsquo;s White population are descended from people who came from western and eastern Europe well after the end of the War Between the States and therefore should not have to bear any repercussions and/or consequences.</p>

<p>I was surprised to note that the sentiments expressed there were more outraged and intense than those on here.</p>
<p>It looks like viewing actual black on white crimes has the biggest impact on whites and brings the fighting spirit out more than anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably why the MSM and the police try to play down or ignore black on white attacks.  They don&rsquo;t want whitey getting up in arms.</p>
<p>With the growing number of recording devices on the street, much is going to get through, however.</p>
<p>But will it be enough to get the white population to a point where they form civilian defense groups, because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to take to put a stop to white beatings, rapes and murders.</p>
<p>Anything short of that would be useless.</p>

Then, I saw the TruTV snippet of blacks tearing up a Denny&rsquo;s restaurant. Then, I saw an IHOP completely demolished.

&#8220;They two assailants were clearly out of line and should be punished. You should also think about your reaction in a situation like that, seeing a transgender male going into he female restroom. How would you react?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would do what most civilized people would do, particularly in a state where it is legal for a transexual to use the bathroom of the gender that they are changing/have changed into. I would wait my turn to go in. (McD&rsquo;s generally has onesies).  What I would NOT do is enlist my friends to beat them half to death.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the neighborhood. I just moved into a new town near Seattle last year. On moving day, there was a shooting of a homeless man, white on white, in the downtown McDonalds parking lot.</p>
<p>The fast food milieu is becoming a more dangerous place. When I want to go somewhere outside the house and read a paper, book or magazine, I like to go to a fast food place rather than a coffee dungeon full of liberal poseurs. But I have learned, I have to pick carefully where I go and look for possible security problems before I stop.</p>
<p>McDonalds, specifically, does not seem to train its employees to pay attention and act when there is a security breach. Employees should be able to call 911 on their own without fear of reprisal from the employer. I know having police calls to a restaurant is bad publicity, but that is the world today.</p>
<p>The fast food industry as a whole pays too little attention to security. When street thugs think there is going to be no response, that is when they are going attack people.</p>
<p>McDonalds, specifically, wants to maintain its image as a squeaky-clean middle class stop, but closing your eyes doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

		<p>There is NO justification for what these people did to the white person in this situation. We are now hearing that the victim is transgendered and attempted to enter the women&rsquo;s restroom, at which point these animals went into a rage and began brutally beating him. I can understand being apprehensive about using the ladies room when there is a male dressed in women&rsquo;s clothing in there; however, does that justify beating the hell out of the person? Couldn&rsquo;t you just quietly wait outside until the person is finished doing their business, and maybe just mumble or think to yourself &#8220;Hmm, well, that&rsquo;s different.&#8221; That&rsquo;s what any sane, logical person with even a shred of decency would think to do.</p>
<p>The liberal media always tells us that minorities are allies (collectively, against heterosexual white males of course) BUT having spent my entire life around blacks, I have found them to be some of the most viciously homophobic people, and I am not the least bit surprised by this beating.</p>

<p>It has the guy who recorded the incident but it also has a picture of the victim.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a direct quote from the article.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police report identifies the victim as 22-year-old Chrissy Lee Polis, who appears identical to Christopher Lee Polis, whose rap sheet includes convictions for disorderly conduct, property destruction, and prostitution, according to court records. The civil rights group Equality Maryland has identified the McDonald&rsquo;s victim as a transgender woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you can see the victim isn&rsquo;t just a white girl, but a transgender man while that&rsquo;s a lifestyle choice, the rap sheet that the police has on the victim does show that the victim may be more than a little unstable.</p>

		<p>Blue Line said, &#8220;My sources in Maryland are telling me that the victim was a transgender/transsexual and there was an &ldquo;exposure of a male body part&rdquo; in the women&rsquo;s restroom that set the attackers off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most people here, whether male or female have been inside a lady&rsquo;s room for some reason at one time or another. You know they are NOT like men&rsquo;s rooms, the facilities are in stalls with doors, and there are no open urinal-type facilties. The only way these girls would have &#8220;seen a male body part&#8221; is if they were climbing up the sides of the stall or crawling under the dividers. <br>
In the end it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if the white person was a male or female, or how s/he was dressed; what the video plainly shows is that two vicious female thugs beat a white person to a bloody pulp for the crime of having white skin.  </p>

		<p>I am just amazed that this is modern day America- it seems you guys are here in South Africa- we have 50 + people killed per day and every 9 seconds a woman raped (or baby- any age female) YET NO ONE would identify the 98% of perpetrators&hellip;..black men! Coloured men after that&hellip;&hellip;and the most a white person( initiation prank on black workers-who live to tell the tale) gets the whole country `s blacks to protest at campuses and streets- weird weird weird! If ever I believed in a conspiracy- it is the one of the Mass media- blacks are victims-whites are perpetrators -My daughter said when she was only 12-`mom, when 4 blacks walk past me- I would think.; one is a rapist, the other a thief, the other a murderer and the last one all four of them combined! </p>
<p>She would note how care free the little  black girls in our area runs to the shop and back-but that she herself would not set a foot in the black town ship-where blacks will rape little girls only going shopping!</p>
<p>She had a lovely little black friend at school  who came and play at our house-the day my daughter was invited to go to the little black girls house my husband said he will take her and check it out!  we had no intention of letting her stay there but for interest matter go through the exercise.  The parents had a `Spaza ` shop at the back of the house and all kind of `customers were lurking about.  When one of them spotted our daughter-he said `I wanna marry that one huh huh!` A U-turn and never back there again was the only solution- and the little girl could only come and play at our house.  Now the kingpin of the ANC Youth Julius Malema is fighting for his `RIGHT` to sing the song `Shoot the Boer` (farmer)  AND the main stream media is shhhhhhh hushhhh.</p>
<p>IF it was a Jew singing a song `shoot the palestinian` or a white singing `kill a black`  the WHOLE world would v` protested&hellip;.</p>

<p>After having seen an interview with the victim I would not have suspected transgender. Also a women&rsquo;s restroom does NOT have urinals on the walls, so unless this transgender person was whipping it out and peeing in the sink no body parts would be visible.</p>
<p>I do not think this had anything to do with them being offended in the restroom, the victim claims one of the black males approached her as she entered the restroom and tried to talk to her, then one the black females asked if she was messing with &#8220;her man&#8221; and started the harassment. I do believe it is very likely one of the black males approached this seeming &#8220;tall white girl&#8221; and made a pass, and likely wouldn&rsquo;t have cared about if she was all female or not.</p>

		<p>The issue of TS/TG individuals using the facilities of their &#8220;chosen&#8221; gender rather than their biological gender has been a hot one in Maryland for awhile.  The state legislature (or maybe it&rsquo;s several counties) have been considering strong anti-discrimination bills in this stead, whose provisions taken literally means that TS/TG can even use the locker rooms and showers of their chosen gender rather than their biological gender.  I get the the feeling that with the way this anti-white hate crime is going to be spun into an anti-TS/TG hate crime, stuffing race down a memory hole, the opponents of such bills will be halfway blamed for committing this assault, and the bills will gain further legs.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t name any names, but there is a little too much vitriolic hate of Glenn Beck, the Tea Party Movement and other similar individuals emanating from certain people.  Yes, anyone should be criticized when they&rsquo;re wrong, but not to the level of hate in which they engage.  Like you said, this story is getting major traction on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s Blaze website, and though we know he and it would downplay the racial aspect, the people who comment there clearly get it.  Matt Drudge is a clear and present anti-&#8220;racist,&#8221; but within the last several months, these kinds of anti-white hate crime beatdowns have gotten major play on the Drudge Report.  And as for the Tea Party Movement, look at this:</p>

They were hurt some in the melee, but succeeded in driving the negroes from the boat, and then &#8216;cut cable,&rsquo; &#8216;weighed anchor,&rsquo; and left.</i></p>
<p>This is NOT an isolated incident as the media and law enforcement will tell you, black attacks on Whites are common in schools, on buses, in the streets, in malls and in businesses.</p>
<p>Spread the Word and Tell Everyone You Care About!</p>
<p><i>State&rsquo;s Attorney Scott D. Shellenberger said hate crime charges were being considered.</i></p>
<p>Hate crimes will NOT be filed and you know it, Mr. Shellenberger:  You are a spineless White weenie!  Do you believe you&rsquo;d hesitate for one nano-second if the races were reversed?  You will release a press statement today or tomorrow expressing the following:  &#8220;After carefully reviewing the evidence law enforcement has come to the conclusion that race had absolutely nothing to do with this unfortunate incident!&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The LGBT group is now calling on police to investigate the attack as a hate crime.</i></p>
<p>I hate to say this is good news, but in a way it is:  LGBT and Gay advocacy groups are able to play the &#8220;victim&#8221; angle, have powerful advocacy groups and will be able to make their voices heard.  LGBT groups, unlike Whites,  are allowed to openly protest, agitate and boycott McDonalds, receive plenty of media coverage and their noisy voices will forcefully demand Hate Crimes charges be added. </p>
<p>Whites do not have this power.</p>
<p><i>Staff stood by and even laughed</i>&hellip;<i>the employee can be heard laughing hysterically at the violence in front of him.</i></p>
<p>This behavior is in black DNA.  Africans stand around laughing hysterically as tyres full of petrol are ignited around a victim&rsquo;s neck, as he burns to death screaming in agony.</p>

<p><i>Blacks commit more violent crime against whites than against blacks. Forty-five percent of their victims are white, 43 percent are black</i></p>
<p>Statistician La Griffe du Lion writes about black-on-White crime:</p>
<p><i>In the city, the races live mostly apart from one another, so that the most convenient victims of thugs are others of the same race. Only a hunter&rsquo;s mentality could account for the data.</i></p>

<p><i>This is a reminder to all you white people that these are vicious people. Protect your family by having them keep their distance from them (blacks). Our courts and government are not going to protect you from them.</i></p>
<p>You must go further than just avoidance of blacks as they now freely ride &#8220;metros&#8221; into White areas, I believe for the purpose of hunting Whites.  You must teach your family members and loved ones to protect and defend themselves with deadly force.  </p>
<p>The only thing that stops criminal blacks from attacking Whites is brutal force administrated without prejudice, without mercy.</p>
<p>And this:</p>

<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>We must let these companies know that we will not do business with them if they will not protect our people.</p>
<p>This was my immediate sentiment as I thought about the hypocrisy, lies and PC reign of terror we Whites are currently subjected to&hellip;The ONLY way we can fight back is by boycotting businesses that ALLOW this kind of mayhem against our people.</p>

		<p>With all respect what exactly is a &#8220;transgendered woman&#8221;? Is this a guy who just dresses and acts as a woman and still manintains full male sexual genitalia and anatomy? I don&rsquo;t think people like that should have access to female washrooms. Would you want your small daughter or niece going into a washroom by herself with such a person in there? I&rsquo;m not talking about a male who has had a full sex-change operation now. Again it is the whole &#8220;transgender&#8221; thing. From what I could Google, the whole thing is extremely vague. It could mean just a guy who chooses to live as a woman - while still having all of their original natural male sexual genitalia. I am not at all comfortable with such people imposing themselves upon the wider society in such an intrusive and intimate manner. Here in Canada pre-op &#8216;transexuals&rsquo; and various others have demaned to use female changerooms at gyms. Many female gym memebers have complained about this. The &#8220;trannies&#8221; then run off to a &#8220;human rights commsion&#8221; - not a real courtroom mind you - and sues the gym owner. You can see the no win situation the hapless gym owner is in. </p>

This guy should have used the men&rsquo;s bathroom. If this would have hurt his feelings, than he would have had to deal with it. So he hurt the feelings of two girls, who happened to react very politically incorrect.<br>

		<p>Unquestionably, blacks are the most intractable problem facing this nation, long term or short.</p>
<p>Their relatively low level of intelligence and impulse control (as a group) means that they can never be wholly, or even significantly, assimilated.</p>
<p>How it will all end defies accurate prediction, but most likely the most satisfactory outcome will be the total resegregation of America, with blacks herded into enclaves and kept there by force of arms.  Of course, this would result in massive starvation, epidemic, and violent death for these primitive hunter-gatherers, who ironically were brought from the only continent which could support their nomadic and primitive lifestyle.</p>
<p>Ironically, Lincoln was perhaps the first prominent race realist, with his plans to resettle blacks either back in Africa or in the Caribbean and Central America.  Not surprisingly, his first tentative overtures toward these areas were met with threats of violence from the intended victims of this plan.</p>

<p>The last time I went to McDonald&rsquo;s was in 1978. McDonald&rsquo;s is &#8220;fast food&#8221; and as such it appeals to races with impulse control, not to mention filthy homes where nobody would want to prepare food, let alone eat it. Mickey-D&rsquo;s is basically a for profit food pantry for dirt bags. Whenever I have the occasional yearning for a good hamburger I go to In-N-Out which is a burger chain run by and for white folks.</p>
<p>By the way, you don&rsquo;t need to carry a gun and risk jail for protecting yourself. Pepper spray works gangbusters   &mdash;   you can buy it in compact aerosol or buy cartridges for a Mace gun, which is fairly compact. Be advised though that when you use this stuff inside, like a restaurant or a metro car, you&rsquo;re gonna be hacking and wheezing too, but not nearly so bad as the guy you blast, who won&rsquo;t be able to open his eyes for at least 15 minutes.</p>

		<p> The biggest problem with a white  jumping into a fight like that to help a fellow white is the reaction of the local police force. No matter what the occasion, they&rsquo;re on the side of the blacks. As part of the &#8220;protected class&#8221; the police are forced to protect them first, last and forever. This is the ironic situation that the police departments everywhere find themselves in and it appears there is no way out.</p>

		<p><i>As a law enforcement officer, the sheer viciousness of this attack tells me that there is something going on besides a &ldquo;she cut in front of me in line&rdquo; or a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s jump on the White girl&rdquo; kind of fight. They were trying to kick and stomp this woman&rsquo;s head in and kept attacking her repeatedly. Most assault calls involving women, even black ones, are nothing as bad as this. My sources in Maryland are telling me that the victim was a transgender/transsexual and there was an &ldquo;exposure of a male body part&rdquo; in the women&rsquo;s restroom that set the attackers off. This has not been confirmed, but it would help explain the prolonged brutality of the attack.  </i></p>
<p><br>
This is a point that has to be considered. We do not yet know all the facts of the case. We just have this video. It&rsquo;s too easy to jump on sensationalized images without getting the background. Look at the Hofstra alleged rape case, or Duke University, for that matter. </p>

&ldquo;They two assailants were clearly out of line and should be punished. You should also think about your reaction in a situation like that, seeing a transgender male going into he female restroom. How would you react?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would do what most civilized people would do, particularly in a state where it is legal for a transexual to use the bathroom of the gender that they are changing/have changed into. I would wait my turn to go in. (McD&rsquo;s generally has onesies). What I would NOT do is enlist my friends to beat them half to death.</p>
<p><br>
Perhaps that&rsquo;s the problem.  THE problem.  The only problem when we boil it down to its core.  Because let me tell you something.  A pervert entering the woman&rsquo;s rest room quite CLEARLY meets the criteria of something that should be met with this level of violent resistance.  It&rsquo;s an inherently  aggressive act.  A prelude to rape, child molestation or some other crime that will involve a victim.  This is a MAN, not a woman, trying to sneak in where women are at their most vulnerable.  Unfortunately for him, he walked into a place where the women themselves are vicious predators.</p>
<p>But what disgusts me to no end is the backflips cowardly white men are doing to dismiss the fact that it is THEY themselves that should be doing this&hellip;.to the point that this pervert should be too terrified to attempt something like this ANYWHERE.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t hide behind the race issue either.  Because the same reason blacks feel emboldened to hunt white victims is the same reason this pervert felt they could walk in off the street and just enter a woman&rsquo;s rest room without challenge.</p>
<p>People should take a cold hard look at that video again and imagine if everyone in it was white.  And understand that the fact that everyone in it NOT being white is the problem.</p>
<p>White cowardice has gotten to the point that whites will treat criminal deviants as victims, and protect them, when someone at last does something about them.</p>
<p>The blacks won&rsquo;t put up with that.  And neither should we.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think violence against an innocent individual is EVER okay.  However, I, like other posters above, am quite disturbed that people like this are allowed in women&rsquo;s restrooms.  I second what the above poster asked: &#8220;what is a transgender woman?&#8221;.  I refuse to refer to this person as a &#8220;girl&#8221;, especially when you see the shots of HIM standing next to the girls where you can clearly see that he is taller and broader shouldered than they are.  HE could have fought back.</p>
<p>And what does the fact that a &#8220;transgendered woman&#8221; can go into the women&rsquo;s restroom mean exactly?  Some of the points that other posters above bring up really disturb me.  Are we getting to the point where men can just go into women&rsquo;s locker rooms whenever they wish just as long as they say &#8220;I want to be a woman&#8221;????   I for one, will NOT tolerate that at all, nor should other women tolerate it.</p>
<p>We are becoming a sick, sick, society!  All that aside, violence of this nature is never acceptable.</p>

I get SOME of what you&rsquo;re saying, about the transgender guy being deviant,<br>
but I must contest that you are simply WRONG in thinking gay people are &#8220;perverts&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m straight, and no liberal. I just know that most, by FAR, most gay people did not choose to think or feel gay. They just are. Yep, it IS GENETIC!<br>
I get VERY tired of gay people who have to be dramatic, and all that, but I also feel that whether I like it are not, they were born that way.</p>
<p>And I agree it&rsquo;s creepy. I agree it&rsquo;s freakish (to you and me) to see a transgender&hellip;but they are in one hell of a pickle, they are one sex locked in the body of the other sex. It gets VERY hard to deny this, seeing men who are so OBVIOUSLY like women, and women who so clearly are masculine. <br>
We don&rsquo;t have to like it, but fighting that reality is like saying you won&rsquo;t allow it to rain tomorrow.<br>
Now, vicious thuggery, black on white racism manifested in murder&hellip;that needs to be met with irresistible force.</p>

<p>If you think it&rsquo;s so easy being a deviant, try being a white HETEROSEXUAL male. You need a court order to ask for a date, and you might end up being on a watch list and having to register for life anyway. What you&rsquo;re saying is true but it isn&rsquo;t the whole story.

		<p>I have very mixed feelings about this. Yes the beating was brutal. Yes I believe it was at least partly about race. But I have real problems with this whole &#8220;transgender&#8221; thing. I didn&rsquo;t know that at first. I thought she was just a hapless white female. I couldn&rsquo;t even find an EXACT definition of the word &#8220;transgender&#8221; when I did an interent search. It could - so far as I could tell - just mean a guy who wears a dress, some makeup and fancies himself a woman, even if he is the size of a pro wrestler. We used to call them transvestites, or more derogatorly, &#8220;drag queens&#8221;. DO YOU REALLY WANT THESE PEOPLE having free license to use female washrooms, changerooms at will? Should they have free access to women at their most intimate and vulnerable? To say nothing of young girls? Imagine this scenario. You are at a rest stop on the interstate. Your eight year old daughter has to use a public washroom. A minute later some six-foot, 220 pound cross dresser or &#8216;tranny&rsquo; (er, I mean &#8220;a transgendered woman&#8221;) goes in there. You of course don&rsquo;t know this person from a bale of hay. Now how would you feel about that? What if - even by accident - she saw something she SHOULDN&rsquo;T have seen? How would you feel about that? How would it affect her at such a young age? What about women having these people in their changerooms at gyms or other events? This is a real source of problems here. And even if these people don&rsquo;t mean any harm, just think how allowing such a situation could open opportunities for true degenerates, perverts and child molestors. Is this appropriate? </p>

<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t care for  it either, but the fact is that in Europe, and in most other foreign countries, it is entirely the common thing to find female bathroom attendants in mens rooms,  and women just walk in and out.  They use the mens room when the womens room is full.  It bothers me, as an American. I don&rsquo;t like it.  We aren&rsquo;t used to this, but foreigners just think we&rsquo;re quirky.</p>
<p>As for that young person, he/she should have waited his turn to go in (and probably did). I know that McD&rsquo;s has a lock on the door and when you&rsquo;re in there you can be alone. It&rsquo;s no problem.  Also, if he did accidentally walk in on them,  why didn&rsquo;t they beat him up IN the room, instead of doing it  OUTSIDE where everyone could see?  In short, I doubt he did walk in on them. He probably was just GOING to go in, but never did.</p>
<p>I also suspect (as Sonya suggested) that there&rsquo;s more to this story   &mdash;   specifically something about messin&rsquo; with their man. That&rsquo;s far more likely.   I don&rsquo;t think these virtuous young  &#8220;ladies&#8221; would be too shocked at finding a man in their restroom. These cringing violets don&rsquo;t seem like the easily shocked type.  There&rsquo;s more in this picture. </p>

		<p>To those saying he flashed his genitals, that&rsquo;s digusting, and there is absolutely nothing that reports this so far. Look up the first interview with the victim. &#8220;She&#8221; states that first of all, she is &#8220;post-op&#8221; that part I have a bit of trouble believing, due to a long psychological evaluation period before most hospitals will do the surgery, and she is only 22.</p>
<p>I do believe what she said about where the fight originated. Just outside of the restroom. In the victim&rsquo;s words..the fight was started because one of the black females thought she was hitting on her boyfriend. I can&rsquo;t say that warrants anything close to what she received, and I think it&rsquo;s cruel that the posters on here say that &#8220;she&#8221; deserves this. </p>

		<p>The POLICE listed the victim as a woman, so that tells us that whether the sex change operations are final or not, at least the external male bits are gone or this person would have been listed as male regardless of how she &#8220;views herself&#8221;. <br>
Also just because this person is &#8220;transgendered&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t mean  s/he is a child molester.  I would feel less threatened about my child being in the same restroom as an anatomically correct white female (regardless of how she was born) than with a black of either gender.<br>
I wonder how long it has been since her last surgery and if she is still recovering? That might have something to do with why she didn&rsquo;t fight back.<br>

&ldquo;They two assailants were clearly out of line and should be punished. You should also think about your reaction in a situation like that, seeing a transgender male going into he female restroom. How would you react?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would do what most civilized people would do, particularly in a state where it is legal for a transexual to use the bathroom of the gender that they are changing/have changed into. I would wait my turn to go in. (McD&rsquo;s generally has onesies). What I would NOT do is enlist my friends to beat them half to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point and the key word &#8220;civilized&#8221;<br>
 Blacks are incapable of reasoning anything out including the consequences of their actions. They react violently on impulse. You can&rsquo;t defuse their anger which will explode in response to incidents that most Whites will simply brush off.e.g accidentally bumping into them on the street or in a crowded store. That every day occurence that we come to accept can trigger a stabbing or beatdown.<br>
There is not nor will there EVER be harmony between the two races. <br>
I taught for many years and in a school were there was a diverse student body. I honestly never witnessed a fight between White and Asian kids. They generally mingled with each other in the cafeteria and in after school clubs. With the Blacks it was always self segregation on their part. Fights were White on White and Black on White and in the latter it was always the Black who initiated it over a bump in the corridor or some other innocuous incident for which he didn&rsquo;t receive a gushing apology from the White &#8220;offender&#8221;.<br>
Fights between Black &#8220;girls&#8221; were always accompanied by the ear splitting 5 million decibel shreiking of obscenities and the large clumps of bloody hair on the floor. Teachers who attempted to separate them risked injuries especially if they were White.<br>
They really need to be in all Black schools with all Black teachers. Al Sharpton is a no good race mongering, chaos causing, lying bastard but in this case he was right in calling for re-segregation. Separation is the answer.<br>
Nothing is ever going to change and I fear that a violent White backlash may be on the Horizon.</p>

		<p>As far as transsexuals and restrooms  &mdash;  if you have a Y chromosome, you use the men&rsquo;s room, end of story.  You can mutilate yourself and dress however you want, but you cannot change your genes.</p>
<p>That having been said, I would have just been annoyed at a man using the women&rsquo;s room.  There was no reason for this all-out assault.  There&rsquo;s expressing disapproval, then there&rsquo;s going too far.</p>

		<p>A trannie who keeps visiting female restrooms is asking for trouble sooner or later. Like they say, if you cannot stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen (or women&rsquo;s washrooms in this case).</p>
<p>While I am not condoning the fact that the teenage girls overreacted, I hope those who judge them cut them some slack. The younger one is just 14, a kid, for Chrissake! When are teenagers that young supposed to be expected to be mature enough while faced with a potentially dangerous adversary (to their minds) to be aware of legal repercussions (including trannie rights)? C&rsquo;mon!<br>
After all, don&rsquo;t women&rsquo;s self defense courses teach even adult women to use WHATEVER it takes to repulse threatening men (including pepper spray, biting, scratching, puking, kicking the loins, etc?)<br>
Sorry, but the overreaction of the girls has been superseded by the overreaction of the posters here, who have rushed to judgment too quickly.<br>

		<p>  Perhaps, the media has been more open with this inter-racial attack because the victim was &#8220;transgendered&#8221;? In any case, with the decline in the economy, the glue of prosperity is wearing thin these days. People will have less reason to get along in an impoverished Third World America. Black women seem to getting more violent as of late. Is this progress?</p>

		<p>From what I can determine from reading various sources these blacks probably didn&rsquo;t even know that this woman was transgendered, if she is at all.  </p>
<p>They set upon her because they thought she was talking to a male connected to one of the blacks.  And, in their eyes, she was a hated white.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re successfully distoring the issue to turn the discussion into one involving &#8220;transgenders,&#8221; when it was more likely than not a racial issue.</p>
<p>Of course the MSM is absolutely delighted to divert attention away from race, and they&rsquo;re in a crazed frenzy as they jump onto the transgender issue.  The British press especially ignores race whenever it can.  Note the number of people on this site who have been duped into regarding the issue as one of sexual identification.</p>
<p>Although there are NUMEROUS black on white racist attacks every year they have been successfully diverted to other causes or played down to the point of insignificance by the radical media.  And there is every indication they will have continued success, which means the only chance to rid ourselves of these vicious black primitives is through civil action which can only  come about after an economic collapse, when the government and press are too weak to spew their propaganda, and the truth is revealed on a daily basis.</p>

		<p>This is the same thing as when nine blacks attacked and beat a white women on a Baltimore bus. We heard race crime charges then, they refused to press them.</p>
<p>I have no doubt they will refuse to press them here. Black mobs attack whites ib the streets, again refusal to charge them with hate crimes.</p>
<p>Hate crime charges are aimed almost solely against whites, even though black/Hispanic attacks against whites are hundreds to one.</p>

		<p>I am willing to bet that if the attackers knew she was not a man, they might have left her to herself. It appears that the black folk didn&rsquo;t realize that there might be such thing as a transgender woman. They may ignorantly believe there are just Born Men and Born Women. Time to educate YOURSELVES!  Common-sense parenting, psychological help, and the Internet provide everything our tax dollars should have. Hopefully, some of those people will use their time in prison wisely.</p>
<p>Early yesterday I was the sole customer sitting in a Highland Park McDonalds enjoying a movie and a coffee. A high-school dropout, still young enough to be in school, asked for an application and sat down right at my table, asking me if I would be able to help him fill it out. I remembered being young and unsure of myself, so naturally, I helped him and we talked and ate for hours. We even exchanged numbers, and I found him a voice coach who will work with him on what he can afford.</p>
<p>He did not care whether I was straight, gay, bi, or transgender, or white, for that matter. He was living in a shelter I know about. He said he had some good parenting and he uses the Internet, but his parents were killed in a car accident. He asked me for nothing but help on his application, but I hope he will be my friend, as he taught me well about myself.</p>
<p>We need mutual respect and love amongst our neighbors.</p>

Your experience is legion, especially among teachers, law enforcement, customer service reps as well as others that interact with the public.  I gave up a senior management position with substantial pay to no longer face what we called, &#8220;chimpouts&#8221;.  The black females were the most atrocious and dangerous.  Being a white male tied my hands in what I could say and do.  I was informed at one point that any physical assualt that didn&rsquo;t do &#8220;too much damage&#8221;, I was to ignore.  The yelling and cursing was the worst.  I am a Navy vet and I rarely heard such language from men. I could no longer protect myself or my staff so I retired.  I feel as if we are being herded both psychologically and physically much like the jews were in 1930&rsquo;s Germany.  And would anyone blame me if I said that our society encourages and ignores such criminal behavior when directed towards white citizens?</p>

 &#8220;A pervert entering the woman&rsquo;s rest room quite CLEARLY meets the criteria of something that should be met with this level of violent resistance. It&rsquo;s an inherently aggressive act. A prelude to rape, child molestation or some other crime that will involve a victim. This is a MAN, not a woman, trying to sneak in where women are at their most vulnerable.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
 &#8220;Imagine this scenario. You are at a rest stop on the interstate. Your eight year old daughter has to use a public washroom. A minute later some six-foot, 220 pound cross dresser or &lsquo;tranny&rsquo; (er, I mean &ldquo;a transgendered woman&rdquo;) goes in there. You of course don&rsquo;t know this person from a bale of hay. Now how would you feel about that?&#8221; </i></p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>Wow. Perverts?  Sexual predators?  Criminal deviants?  WhaT &#8220;crime&#8221;  did this sad,  unfortunate person commit? All she wanted to do was use the rest room.  ALONE! I am sure she has absolutely no interest in your  daughter, or any other female. So stop inserting what wasn&rsquo;t there. Some imaginations here are running  wild.</p>
<p>There is so much hysterical speculation going on about this.  Has anybody ever been in a McDonald&rsquo;s restroom? These are small, one-person rooms.  You go in and lock the door behind you. You are alone. Nobody can  walk in on you. These are not multiple use bathrooms.</p>
<p>Can we have some sanity here?  All this hysteria is simply crazy.</p>
<p>(And all this talk about these two violent, thuggish girls as being &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; is even crazier.)</p>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m to be honest the trans-gendered angle lessens a little of the anger I felt. I believe few homosexuals or transsexuals feel any real loyalty to the white race. Most are in the far-left fringe category on pretty much any social issue you can name. I wonder if this person would appreciate any of the sympathy coming from a few &#8216;dirty racists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>OTOH, If the blacks knew HE was a trans. then it may not be a racial attack so much as disgust; if they still thought it was a white girl coming on to a black man then it&rsquo;s a definite racial hate crime.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

<p>Coward!  You see a human being being beaten by two young women and you do nothing?  At least you could raise a fuss and call 911.  But a real man would jump in and deflect some of those blows.  I don&rsquo;t care if it was a homosexual, transsexual, crossdresser, or whoever, a civilized man doesn&rsquo;t stand by or even run away from a scene like this.  </p>
<p>BTW,That it was a technical male in a women&rsquo;s restroom is no excuse.  I&rsquo;ve been crowded situations (in America) were women have qued up for men&rsquo;s room stalls, and no one said anything.  </p>
<p>However, this is a case for concealed carry laws to expand.  I don&rsquo;t eat fast food, and I view McDonald&rsquo;s as the worst of the junk, but if I lived in such an area, I would carry or leave, which I understand whites are doing in droves.  At least go where you have the right to defend yourself and the innocent around you.<br>

<p>I hear you. I too worked with loud, morbidly obese black women. I recall to this day one of them once &#8220;going off&#8221; on me. I never saw anything like it before in my life. Later she had the audacity to complain to my superiors about me &#8220;not communicating&#8221; with her. Gosh, I wonder why?</p>
<p>Reply to #135: I was simply using a hypothetical example to describe a deplorable situation, one threatening to become commonplace here in Canada. I didn&rsquo;t say this particular person was so responsible. Again how would MOST people, evidently not you, FEEL if a big 220 pound &#8216;tranny&rsquo; felt free to use a female washroom where your young daughter was? I would clearly be very unhappy with such a situation. Take the following scenario. We have a guy. Lets call him &#8216;Don&rsquo;. He is 6&rsquo;2&#8221; and weighs 220. One day he decides to call himself &#8216;Donna&rsquo; and to live as a &#8220;woman&#8221;. How does this suddenly give him the &#8220;right&#8221; to have free access to female facilities?</p>
<p>Reply to Stiv:</p>
<p>I have to agree here. The great bulk of Lesbians/Gays (especially the former) are no friend at all to the cause of white nationalism. In fact they are very often on the far side of the other fence. They are frequently involved in the wackiest of leftist political causes. I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when you have a lifestyle so at odds with social norms. There may be a FEW gay conservatives, but they are only a handful. The Gay political slant is odd becasue most gays are well aware of black (and other non-whites) views towards them. They know how much &#8216;gay-bashing&rsquo; they do and how blacks treat whites in prison. But I guess needing the leftist/socialist/hollywood endorsement of themselves trumps everything else. </p>

		<p>Some situations involving nudity or partial nudity are just not sexual, and it is a mistake to think that they are.</p>
<p>I was once at a gathering of people of Huguenot ancestry (I have French Huguenot ancestors) and there was a man at the swimming pool who, to be polite, should have been wearing a top or a brassiere.</p>
<p>We women told him to either cover up, or we would uncover. We were politely and amusingly trying to get him to cover up. </p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t, so we did! We were with our husbands, so there was nothing to fear.</p>
<p>But I am concerned about the unprotected in our society  &mdash;  adolescents, teenagers and young adults of both sexes who are at that critical juncture where they are learning to accept their bodies and their sexuality. I think these two black young ladies were at that juncture. Enter a man, and ka-boom! A powder keg.<br>
We, as a society must protect our young. And, sorry to say, the very small minority of &#8220;transgenders&#8221; may loose out  &mdash;  a simple matter of moral economics. </p>

The white male also has to consider how the legal deck is so heavily stacked against him. He would probably face hate crime charges, or worse. I do agree that at the very least one should call 911. One could also try a bluff, suddenly screming out, &#8220;the cops are coming&#8221;. My point is just that, intervention, can mean very heavy costs for a white male in such a situation.</p>

<p> &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>Segregationists did not help their cause by jeering and beating up non violent civil rights demonstrators.</p>
<p>The public image of blacks in the North did not begin to change until the black ghetto riots that happened from 1964 to 1968.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>The media was selective about what they disclosed during the civil rights movement.  What most whites - outside of the South - did not know is that those jeers were made for a reason.  In Birmingham, during the infamous march, not one media outlet reported northern white hippies copulating with blacks on the steps nor of the massive urinating in the street (same culprits) - all in synch - and this was organized by a black pastor!  Even some northern reporters were said to have been disgusted that the information they sent back north was manipulated.  Folks, your whole history has been manipulated!  Segregation existed for a reason and it wasn&rsquo;t what the liberals told/tell you.<br>

		<p>A few people are missing the point.  I agree that this sort of violence was uncalled for and should be punished in this situation.  However, in regards to the transgender issue, I am confused on some of the rebuttals above.  Don&rsquo;t lecture me on how I need to be understanding of the feelings of transexuals when it comes to them using women&rsquo;s restrooms and locker rooms.  </p>
<p>Someone who was born a man and obviously looks like a man has no business going into the women&rsquo;s room.  Remember all those perverted movies from the 80&rsquo;s in which teenage boys would disguise themselves as girls so that they could go into the girl&rsquo;s locker room or dormatory or whatever, to see them undressed?  How do we as women know that a man who dresses like a woman is NOT doing that?  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about the feelings of transexuals.  They need to either stick to the men&rsquo;s room, since that is how they were born, and accept the fact that they are an odd minority who needs to respect the rights of others, either that, or they need to have their own restroom all together.  Pure and simple. </p>
<p>Someone above lumped gays and lesbians into this mix. Quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with lesbians in the locker room with me.  They have the same parts as me and they are women. If they look at me, I may find it weird, but I am hardly embarrassed about it.</p>
<p>As an aside note, quite frankly this whole debate reminds me of another one: the topic of women bringing their sons (well over the age of 3) into women&rsquo;s locker rooms. There are actually entire websites dedicated to that discussion.  One thing that amazes me is the amount of &#8220;me me me&#8221; attitudes in these debates with little regard for the privacy concerns for the MAJORITY of women. If you don&rsquo;t have a husband to watch your male children while at the swimming pool, well then by all means, take them home to shower and change!  Why inflict your selfish impulses and &#8220;rights&#8221; on those of the majority of other women who go into the female locker room to AVOID the opposite gender looking at them which includes male children between 4 and 12 who have absolutely no business in there. </p>
<p> I am amazed at the number of women I see bringing their sons into women&rsquo;s changing rooms and restrooms with them.  I see it especially at the beach, water parks, and amusement parks. And they don&rsquo;t even teach them to be polite in there.  One time I saw a boy of the age of ten wondering around the shower area by himself looking a little too curious. I guess that is what you get with a society entering the &#8220;me and my children first above others&#8221; mentality, not to mention the &#8220;I have a right to sue you&#8221; mentality.</p>

ALONE! I am sure she has absolutely no interest in your daughter, or any other female. So stop inserting what wasn&rsquo;t there. Some imaginations here are running wild.<br>

<p>Maybe you need to do some more research on this story.  I believe he/she was trying to pick up one of the girls boyfriend. </p>
<p> That guy/gal has a long criminal history and was also a &#8220;prostitute&#8221;&hellip;As for them being perverts, deviants, well, YES they are. God gave them over to a REPROBATE mind. I will go along with what God says, not you or anyone else says. </p>

		<p>Someone, please, go to the restrooms of this unfortunate place and take video showing how it all works.  Stalls that are closed, doors that lock, size of facilities etc. etc.</p>
<p>This is how we make a point that sticks in the MSM liar&rsquo;s craw.</p>
<p>That no &#8216;implied truth&rsquo; is more than a wish fulfillment (please believe us!) fantasy when put up against _just the facts ma&rsquo;am&hellip;_.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go for the whole TS/TG thing, the others are correct in feeling highly compromised about female vulnerability in situations like this.</p>
<p>But the fact remains that we _never_ get our day in court because we are not &#8216;one of Holder&rsquo;s people&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So the point where it becomes racial and thus useful to our cause seems to be &#8216;how could it be like they say if the guy was locked in a stall or indeed, never reached it&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Back when I worked fastfood (Long John Silver&rsquo;s) our bathrooms would accomodate two men, with one using the urinal, or one woman.  Because there was not room for two stalls.</p>
<p>That kind of unfortunate detail is how you sort the sheep from the goats in the he-she said/they said debate that this is likely going to devolve to.</p>

In other words bring back right to refuse service laws and you will see more polite blacks if they want to eat a Big Mac, or see a movie.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, there are gay men out there who live under the radar and don&rsquo;t feel the need to act flamboyant or be &#8216;provocative&rsquo; in public. It seems some of you on here really need to become more cultured. The white race needs all the help it can get for survival. Claiming all *white* gays are liberals and against the white race is foolish. I am a gay, conservative white male. Wake up, we are out here.</p>

		<p>I tried commenting on a number of LGBT websites about this incident. I explained why I felt &#8220;transgender&#8221; woman with male genitalia don&rsquo;t have an inherent &#8220;right&#8221; to use female washrooms. I was very, very polite and diplomatic. None of my comments were published. In some respects gays are a mirror image of blacks, hearing and believing only what they want to hear and believe. </p>

		<p>This was one of the most vicious things I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I&rsquo;m glad the victim survived the beating and is recovering(I worried most of the weekend about her fate).</p>
<p>The fact that the victim is a transgendered female is irrelevant to me. There&rsquo;s no justification for this brutality. I also doubt the(now fired) employee&rsquo;s claim that the two black female thugs were enraged that a man was attempting to use the women&rsquo;s rest room. If that&rsquo;s true, that certainly would be ironic. I would imagine that there&rsquo;s greater risk for harm if a transgendered female uses the men&rsquo;s restroom. And if something untoward did occur,you don&rsquo;t handle the situation by beating the person within an inch of &#8220;her&#8221; life.</p>

		<p>According to the video interview of the victim, the black girl was mad at her because she talked to the black girl&rsquo;s man (though he had approached her). Thus, apparently, the black girl <b>did not start the fight over  use of the bathroom,</b> as many speculate, and it&rsquo;s not even clear that the tranny  ever made it into the bathroom at all before being  assaulted. Apparently she didn&rsquo;t.  So this was not about the bathroom.  Nor is it clear that the blacks even knew that &#8220;she&#8221; was transgendered.  (How would they know?)  In other words, she was to them just another white women.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the (older) black girl has been identified as Teonna Monae Brown.  She wqs arrested for assaulting another woman during this past year, but the charges were later dropped by the prosecutors.</p>

		<p>Regarding the transgender comments. </p>
<p>&#8220;Most are in the far-left fringe category on pretty much any social issue you can name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am less angry knowing they were transgender&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Is this a guy who just dresses and acts as a woman and still manintains full male sexual genitalia and anatomy? I don&rsquo;t think people like that should have access to female washrooms. Would you want your small daughter or niece going into a washroom by herself with such a person in there? I&rsquo;m not talking about a male who has had a full sex-change operation now. Again it is the whole &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; thing. From what I could Google, the whole thing is extremely vague.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok LESSON time. </p>
<p>First of all &#8220;transgender&#8221; is a pathetic horrible word shoved down the throats it is a terrible disgusting demeaning word that means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. The people we call &#8220;transgender&#8221; don&rsquo;t want to be called &#8220;transgender&#8221; It is a NONSENSE word. You are RIGHT it is extremely vague. </p>
<p>The correct terms are transvestite (or crossdresser) and transsexual. Transvestites are MEN who dress as WOMEN. </p>
<p>Now here is the key point. TRANSSEXUALS are BIOLOGICALLY INTERSEXED FEMALE BRAINED individuals with a birth defect such that they did not obtain an outward female body. They go through medical intervention to correct the body because it is not possible to change the brain. Legally a transsexual IS (or well should be) a female. Transsexual transition is NOT COVERED by insurance and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars AND MOREOVER IS INCREADIBLY PAINFUL. ANYONE WILLING TO GO THROUGH AND SUFFER ALL THAT DESERVES FULL RECOGNITION OF WOMANHOOD. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you have NO BASIS whatsover to refer to such people as &#8220;LEFT FRINGE&#8221;.  If anything most I have met are conservative, highly intelligent, and respectful people. </p>
<p>As for being &#8220;less angry&#8221; upon hearing they were different, thats just shameful.</p>

		<p>Chivalry and commonsense would dictate ANYWHERE in the world that when young female teenagers beat up a man who walks into a woman&rsquo;s restroom, the public would take the side of the fairer sex and hand the guy getting beaten up over to the police. Obviously, he is not getting beaten up without a reason.</p>
<p>This would be the case when all the people involved are of one race. Just think it over. It is just a tragic twist of logic that the scenario should play out differently when the girls and the man belong to different races. In my opinion, unwarranted.<br>

<p>Young men need to see women naked. They need to see how real women look, not the plastic porno women they are going to be deluged with later in life.</p>
<p>I made it a point to let my sons see me, as well as other women, whenever possible. We were not ashamed at all  &mdash;  we considered it to be a mutual, loving project for the benefit of our sons. I was glad to return the favor to these women&rsquo;s young sons.</p>
<p>Young girls also need to see men, but it is not nearly as crucial.</p>
<p>Both girls and boys of teenage years need to work in their church nursery changing diapers. In this way, they see the biological (and messy!) dimension of human bodies. Artistic appreciation can come later.</p>
<p>Courtney, I just wish we could sit and talk someday, maybe with a glass of  du bon vin français!</p>

_________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Wow, Courtney, I agree with you about that.<br>
I&rsquo;m a man, and a few months ago, some guy brought his two kids into the locker room in&hellip;one was a little girl, I&rsquo;d guess age three and a half. </p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m stark naked, and this little girl is visually transfixed on my privates. It felt a little weird, to say the least! I wanted to tell dad he was a jackass, and I could go on and on. But his innocent kids were there, and that would be traumatic for THEM.<br>
So I said nothing. I was a bit angry for awhile, but then I thought:<br>
The guy was white. He was probably pretty civil. His kids were little. He may have had no other choice. Maybe he could have thought it out more, but he chose to inconvenience the other male patrons and possibly put some weird feelings into his daughter, in order to NOT have to leave them in a stranger&rsquo;s company outside. <br>
Maybe this was a tempest in a teapot, all things considered&hellip;there&rsquo;s bound to be SOME friction in a free society of equals&hellip;and in this case, that&rsquo;s what it was.<br>
So I counted my blessings this wasn&rsquo;t OAKLAND, that we were white, decent and roughly intelligent, and went on my way.</p>

<p>Not really. </p>
<p>I consider Transsexuals to be mentally insane which may have a biological basis. Attributing biology as the reason for the abnormally doesn&rsquo;t make them an less insane.</p>
<p>The irony is despite wanting to considered a &#8220;woman&#8221; they will file hate crimes under the term transsexuals because they duel identity/personality complex.</p>
<p>They will never be recognized as &#8220;women&#8221; or &#8220;men,&#8221; as clearly shown by the video.</p>

		<p>What it all boils down to is  &mdash;  it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the victim was male, female or something in between, the fact remains that the victim was a slender white person beaten into a seizure by two obese, vicious, black female thugs for the thrill of it, and not one soul in the place stood up to them except one elderly white woman.<br>
There IS a war against white people going on in this country and this &#8220;Miss Crissy Pollis&#8221; is one more victim out of hundreds each and every day. We need to start fighting back. Every time we see an act of disrespect to a law-abiding white person from one of these uncivilized brutes, EVERY white person in the place should stand up and make it crystal clear to them that their actions will NOT be tolerated in a normal, white society. A population of 13% of the whole should not be allowed to run amok with impunity and commit 72% of all crimes in the nation. </p>

<p>Having lived and worked in Manhattan and Brooklyn for many years, I have found that there really are some very nice Black women out there. Unfortunately, those nice, intelligent Black women are often abused, and sometimes murdered, by other Blacks. However, don&rsquo;t look for long reports on these occurrences in the media. Such things simply don&rsquo;t fit the liberal narrative. <br>
 There is something about Black culture which discourages the pursuit of excellence, and that, I think, is apparent when we look at Africa.  Let&rsquo;s say a farmer in Iowa discovers a better way to produce crops.  What would he do?  He would apply his newly-found method and increase his harvest, and maybe even sell it and become wealthy.  If a Black farmer in Africa discovers a better way, he had best keep it to himself, or else his countrymen would accuse him of using sorcery to produce more crops and kill him. This pattern, repeated over and over for thousands of years up to the present, ensures that Blacks will never progress, and until they stop believing in the leftist cult of victimization, those nice, intelligent ones will only remain what they are- tragic exceptions. </p>

<p>Professor Tony Martin, a black man who was a professor at Georgetown University - once appeared at one of the earliest American Renaissance Conferences, and he gave a speech on the subject of the African Slave trade to America.   I have an audio cassette tape of that speech, in fact.    Perhaps Anonymous #44 might check to see if the AR Store still has a copy of that speech available, and if so - I would recommend that you get a copy of it, listen to it several times, and thereby avoid making a complete fool out of yourself when you post comments.   </p>
<p>Oh, and black nationalist Louis Farrakan has also given a number of speeches on the same topic, and in neither case was the White man cited as the #1 culprit.    Granted, the measly 3-4% of the wealthiest land owners in the South did purchase the slaves for use in their huge farming enterprises - and that did create a &#8216;demand&rsquo; for slaves, but lets get our facts and details straight Mr. #44.  </p>

		<p>Even the usually lily-livered liberal David Ross (a syndicated radio columnist out of Seattle) came out against the attackers today.  However, he not once mentioned the race or the racial difference of the victim (whom he sympathized with), the woman who tried to help (from whom he had a quote), and the perps, the thuggish bystanders and cameraman. </p>

		<p>La mere,</p>
<p>You demonstrate my point perfectly.  Just because you yourself raised your son to see you in the nude in your household, or even among a circle of friends who do the same as you, why does this mean that your son should be able to go in women&rsquo;s locker rooms and see other women nude who don&rsquo;t want to be seen nude by him?</p>
<p>You seem to have an odd and creepy fascination with converting me from my views on modesty on this website, because those are really the only times I ever see you post. Why? You choose to raise your son a certain way and that is fine, but don&rsquo;t assume that most women in society do the same as you, let alone want your son seeing THEM nude.</p>
<p>I thought that above you were agreeing that men and transexuals shouldn&rsquo;t go into women&rsquo;s restrooms etc&hellip;. to respect the privacy of women who want to be modest. So how does this change for women who don&rsquo;t want other women&rsquo;s sons seeing them nude?  It is called a women&rsquo;s locker room for a reason. A women&rsquo;s locker room isn&rsquo;t a place for you to give your son a lesson on the female body.  Do that at home or among your circle of friends who think like you.  </p>
<p>And according to your argument I guess that means grown men should go into women&rsquo;s locker rooms too since perhaps they need a lesson on what a real woman looks like themselves.  Where does it end for you?  Or, as I said before, perhaps there is no purpose to your posts other than to convert me from my views on modesty, which explains the meandering comments from you that have little to do with the original discussion. </p>

		<p>@83 - actually, there were two Hispanics involved in the Marion County case.  I believe the whites were the ones that initially snitched. I&rsquo;m sure they were expecting a simple beat-down, not an ambush, breaking legs, multiple shooting, then burning&disposing; of the body with the help of Mr Stepdad  The other &#8216;boyfriend&rsquo;, Michael Bargo, was the supposed ringleader of the attack.  Bargo and Soto did most of the violence.   They used the white girlfriend as the bait for their trap.  I believe Bargo, all gangster tatt&rsquo;d, is Puerto Rican, as most Hispanics in central/north-central FL.    However, Seath Jackson&rsquo;s facebook page has him dropping gang signs and talking ebonics.  I think he started $h!t with the wrong vato.  Bargo&rsquo;s face when the judge told him that he was death-penalty-available was poetic justice;  he just sank as the reality kicked in.  </p>

<p>I also think that you just might, JUST MIGHT, be the moderator of this discussion board because you posted SO FAST a response!</p>
<p>But, no matter. Yes, I am sensitive to sexual and bodily issues because I, like you, was hung up on that when I was young. It caused me unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Courtney, I applaud your stance on purity, and I was also a virgin when I married my beloved, and that is God&rsquo;s will. But, necessary as these attitudes are, they carry some significant baggage which must be released, after one marries. Not releasing it can ruin a marriage, as I almost did.</p>
<p>Consider this: The early Christians were baptized in the nude, both men and women, in front of the entire congregation. Yes, the lighting (torches) was dim, but I am touched by this ceremony of trust and acceptance. It was not sexual at all.<br>
Just consider this, and the implications of it.</p>
<p>Courtney, if you want to talk to me, one on one, leave a message with the folks at Amren. I will respond.     </p>

<p>Personally, I consider allowing young children to see adults of the oppose sex naked gratuitously and with regularity (i.e. other than just a bathroom accident), to be child abuse.  While I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to classify young boys seeing grown men naked with regularity, or young girls seeing grown women naked with regularity, as child abuse, it is something whose frequency I would minimize as far as possible if I had any say in the matter.</p>

<p>1) the attackers DID hit the older woman in the face<br>
2) the 18 year old attacker did this exact same thing to another woman at an MCD a year ago. The other victim was supposedly black, and the attacker dragged the woman&rsquo;s daughter across the floor by her hair etc&hellip;</p>

		<p>La Mere, I agree with you.</p>
<p> I never saw my mother naked, except for one day when she did not know I was there. She nearly had a heart attack, and I felt like I had committed some horrible sin!</p>
<p>This is a relic of Puritanism, and is evil.</p>
<p>I am with you  &mdash;  White women, as a group, in locker rooms and elsewhere, are doing a great service to their young sons by being naked in front of them, without shame. They give their sons a realistic view of the female body, and, by not showing shame, they release their sons of guilt. I think the &#8220;You can&rsquo;t see a woman naked!&#8221; thing comes from a wierd combination of Freud (the Oedipus complex  &mdash;  &#8220;if he sees you naked, he will, even though he is a boy, want to have sex with you!&#8221;) and Puritanism (&#8220;the human body is shameful, shameful!&#8221;).</p>
<p> I think this Freudian/Puritan attitude does the opposite of what was intended in that it leads to a pre-occupation with the human body and leads to pre-marital sex.</p>
<p>In Europe it is quite common for several mothers to get together with their kids at a secluded site, and they all go swimming naked together. </p>
<p>Having said that, I think these blacks should be put in jail!</p>

		<p>James, just like La mere, you miss the point. As I said above, if women want to raise their sons that way, then they need to do it in their own homes, (nobody is stopping them from doing that). They don&rsquo;t need to be bringing their sons into female locker rooms, making other women uncomfortable who don&rsquo;t want to be seem naked by male children who aren&rsquo;t their own. This is a matter of respecting the rights and privacy of the general public, just like this issue in regards to transexuals going into women&rsquo;s restrooms etc&hellip;  it is the exact same thing. We now live in a society that has a &#8220;me me me and my rights&#8221; attitude with little regard for the rights of other people.  </p>
<p>The whole purpose of a locker room is for people to be able to change without being seen by the opposite gender.  It isn&rsquo;t a place for women to teach their sons about a woman&rsquo;s body.  That can be done at home.</p>
<p>As far as this society being Puritan, well, it is what it is, and for now you have to go with the flow.  If you want to do things the way Europeans do, then go live in Europe.  </p>
<p>I am noticing more and more that locker rooms are forbidding children of the opposite gender from going in, and to make up for it, they provide family locker rooms. This is probably happening because enough women were complaining about it. I am wondering if people who think like you and La mere would go so far to break the rules just so you could inflict your views on the majority of women in the locker room who go in there in the first place to avoid being seen nude by the opposite gender.</p>
<p>And I am also curious if you think it is okay for young girls to be in a men&rsquo;s locker room.</p>

		<p>I think the fact that this thread gained renewed energy ONLY after a few posters dared to criticize transsexuals/homosexuals, proves they view themselves as yet another protected, privileged class, with more loyalty to the homosexual pop., specifically, than to whites alone. If anything homosexuals are a distraction.</p>
<p>If my viewpoints make me somehow &#8216;less cultured&rsquo; for supporting far more traditional white values, I think I can accept it.</p>

		<p>Awake in Arkansas said: <i>Every time I think that africans cannot possibly sink any lower they go and prove that they have not even come close to hitting rock bottom.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not &#8220;Africans&#8221;, though.  Actual people from Africa  &mdash;  in the last two or three generations, black or white or any mixture thereof  &mdash;  tend to be hardworking and interested in cultural assimilation.  (&#8220;Tend&#8221;.  Not all, obviously.)  The ones who come here usually want to leave what they left behind, behind.</p>
<p>The problem is <b>American</b> people of long derived African descent.  It&rsquo;s the culture that matters most.  The culture most visibly dominant among American blacks is one that glorifies lawlessness, murder for supposed disrespect, theft, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough to show people with a leftist mindset that this is the case without giving them low hanging fruit to pick at.  So, thus my pedanticism.  This is not a problem with Africans.  This is not an imported problem.  This is a home grown problem, with other Americans who utterly disdain our culture.</p>
