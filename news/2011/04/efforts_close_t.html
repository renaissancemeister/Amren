<h1>Efforts Close to Recall Senate President Russell Pearce</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Ellen Resendez, ABC 15 (Phoenix), April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What may seem to some as an uphill battle is becoming close to a reality for a non-partisan political group as they gather signatures to recall Senate President Russell Pearce.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt we&rsquo;ll get enough signatures to force the recall campaign,&#8221; said Chad Snow, chairman of Citizens for a Better Arizona.</p>
<p>The group has two thirds of the signatures needed to force a recall election on the senator they accuse of having an extreme agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel that Russell Pearce has completely thrown Arizona&rsquo;s economy under the bus so he could pursue one issue,&#8221; said Snow.</p>
<p>That issue is immigration.  Pearce sponsored the controversial SB1070 and even though the law has gained negative national attention, polls show an overwhelming amount of Arizonans support it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Citizens for a Better Arizona needs to collect over 7,700 signatures by May 31st to force a recall election, but Snow is confident they will get more, claiming the Senate President&rsquo;s actions are helping their efforts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t a hard riddle to solve.  Citizens for a &#8220;Better&#8221; Arizona has monetary links to the numerous industries that directly profit from cheap illegal or legal Hispanic labor.  Wherever there are petition signature drives, there is always money in the background, money to pay the people that ask for signatures.</p>
<p>Even if this group gets 7,700 or more signatures, a large percentage of them are always DQed for various legal reasons.  The SoS in Arizona is a Republican, so you know he or she will follow the law in this case.</p>
<p>Even if the recall miracuously makes it to the ballot, I highly doubt the voters of the same State Senate district which elected Pearce from it at least twice would turn right around and bounce him out.  Especially since he&rsquo;s the Senate Majority Leader.</p>

<p>________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>One has to wonder how many of those 7,700 signatures belong to illegal invaders, who would not hesitate to sign a petition to remove the person they deem responsible for their predicament? </p>
<p>Every last one of those signatures needs to be verified as lawful.<br>

		<p>Mr. Self-righteous, as he collects the signatures, seems to think that unfettered immigration will have no effect on &#8220;what Arizonans really care about&#8221;, like employment, schools and government solvency. What planet does he live on?</p>

		<p>Traitor whites selling this country out for money.  Chad Snow is not fooling anyone.  Senator Russell Pearce have been taking heat for a long time what barry and the federal government should be doing. </p>

		<p>So this &#8220;non-partisan group Citizens for a Better Arizona&#8221; will collect enough signatures from the people in the barrios and the &#8220;drop out&#8221; Obama youth vote.</p>
<p>Tens of thousand of dollars will flood into the Pearce campaign. Russell Pearce will win 60% of the vote in the recall election. </p>
<p>Pearce will then win the GOP primary for the open congressional seat in his district, and next year we will be refering to this great patriot as, United States Congressman Russell Pearce.</p>
<p>I truly give the left, er non-partisan group, an A for effort.</p>

		<p>Not only does the State of Arizona overwhelmingly support the bill, But majority of the country does also. Whats funny is the Bill mirrors the federal bill thats already in place. I wish Texas would do the same.</p>

		<p>This is the sort of Alinsky-ite &#8216;kill the messenger&rsquo;  tactic, that Stalin used as Butcher of the Ukraine. To date, the over 100,000,000 millions killed by Communism makes all other &#8216;tragedies&rsquo; pale into insignificance.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it about time we called a spade a spade, and &#8216;outed&rsquo; these criminals for the fifth column Bolshevik/Marxist agitators they are?</p>
<p>Frankly, the longer I live, the more I realize, McCarthy was right. The only good communist&hellip;. etc.</p>

		<p>Yes, what an &#8216;extreme agenda&rsquo; for Americans not to want to foot the bill for criminals, for people who can&rsquo;t speak English, for people who don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t assimilate, for people who are trying to take over their country, and for people that are putting millions of Americans out of work.    I suppose it would NOT be an &#8216;extreme agenda&rsquo; if brown Mexicans trying to fend off millions of (white) Americans who were pouring across their border every year and turning their country into a third world hellhole.  Oh, wait.  They already live in one.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not communists who are behind this, it&rsquo;s capitalists.  Right now, capitalists are the most active enemy of white Americans.  Capitalists are the people who are stopping legislation on illegal immigration from passing all over the country.  Without capitalist lobbying, we would already have several other states with Arizona like laws.  </p>
