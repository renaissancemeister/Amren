<p>As the Hindu population has grown in Queens over the last decade, so too has the amount of ritual debris  &mdash;  clothing, statues, even cremation ashes  &mdash;  lining the banks of the bay in Gateway National Recreation Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;We call it the Ganges,&#8221; one pilgrim, Madan Padarat, said as he finished his prayers. &#8220;She takes away your sickness, your pain, your suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>But to the park rangers who patrol the beach, the holy waters are a fragile habitat, the offerings are trash and the littered shores are a federal preserve that must be kept clean for picnickers, fishermen and kayakers. Unlike the Ganges, they say, the enclosed bay does not sweep the refuse away.</p>

		<p>Let third world people into the country and you get a third world nation.  Very simple concept.</p>
<p>I never quite understood the fawning over &#8220;Asians&#8221; that so many white conservative practice.  If one looks at their own &#8220;civilization&#8221; it is certainly not the type of place most of us would want to live in.  True, there are a few intelligent and modern-acting Indians but for the most part they are way behind Europeans/Euro-Americans in behavior and life style.  Even under the yoke of communism Eastern Europe never sank as low as most of 21st century India.  Cattle running the street, public defecation and dead bodies being burned in the open air or floating down rivers.  When an alien race reaches critical mass and the natives refuse to impose order then the alien&rsquo;s customs take over.</p>
<p>If we ever get out of this mess, which I doubt, I hope every politician who abetted the destruction and takeover of our nation receives the Nuremburg treatment.  If they are deceased, like Ted Kennedy, they should be tried in absentia. And their families must lose all their wealth and property.  People like the Bushes should not be allowed to keep their ill-gotten gain.  This would send a message to future leaders than treason will bite them and their spawn.<br>

		<p>When I was younger 20 or so years ago my family would take me to a beautiful place called Bolton Abbey. <br>
There is a river there and we would have picnics etc etc.<br>
Last year I took my young family to the same place.<br>
 as I dove down the car park at the side of the river there were hundreds of Pakistanis probably from the Bradford/Leeds area. Not one white person in sight, you could see them staring at us as if to say what are you doing here.<br>
 We parked facing the river a family walked past the front of the car a boy of around 12 years old dropped his trousers and squatted right there on the bank and did his business, the family couldn&rsquo;t care less. <br>
I didnt even let my family out of the car we drove out of there as quick as I could. In 20 years my country has turned into a third world hell hole.</p>

		<p>I grew up in &#8220;Little Guyana&#8221; and I can tell you any white New Yorker caught polluting gets a stiff fine from the police, and rightly so.</p>
<p>According to this article the park rangers threaten the invaders w/fines but don&rsquo;t write them up. They also go to local Hindu temples and beg the invaders to please obey our laws.</p>
<p>Must be nice to be a Protected Minority.</p>

<p>I have said this a million times, but try to tell your average White sheeple the truth about race.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t they have eyes any longer? Can they not SEE? What is wrong with the White brain? It has become so tainted that a return to sanity doesn&rsquo;t seem likely whatsoever.</p>
<p>ANY other race than White should NEVER be allowed inside White borders, period. I pray for the day that ever happens. But I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope of it ever happening in my lifetime.</p>

		<p>Problem is a bit more wide spread than that.  One day at work I needed to take a toilet break so walked into the private toilets that are locked to the public, opened the door and there are 2 Indians standing at the 2 wash basins.  Each Indian was standing on 1 foot (and in only their underwear) with the other foot in the basins washing them under running the running taps like the water was flowing straight from the Ganges.  </p>
<p>Water and clothes were all over the floor.  I just stood there dumbfounded, turned around and left thinking I can hold it.  Reported them for creating an OH&S; slip hazard and haven&rsquo;t caught them doing it since.</p>

		<p>You knew this was going to happen as soon as the Hindu population became large enough. The Hudson River is next. A few years back I went to the Catskills to visit  North-Lake-South Lake to see the top of the waterfall there. This is a very famous waterfall. The Hudson Valley School of Art had its orign right there at the top of the waterfall. As I approached the top of the waterfall&hellip;.40 Hindus popped out of nowhere..parents,cousins,kds and grandkids. I said to myself:&#8221;Ganges NY&#8221;.</p>
<p>As I have written many times here:we are entering a very dangerous times. It is all going to end so very badly..to quote Peter Brimelow:&#8221;it will end with lots of tears&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyone who believes that it will be possible to protect endangered species  and ecosystems in an America that is racially balkanized then broken-up into different race-based nations is massively delusional. The situation in America is completely insane.  All the millions of White American Men lost in Sports Entertainment and Fantasy Sports are going to be in for a very big schock. Just wait for the massive water and food shortages&hellip;both will become scarce and they will have to share these two scarce resources with the Hindus in &#8220;America&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just a reminder, if the bucolic Hudson River Valley area is turned into a Ganges River type pool, it will have been the direct consequence of the Republican-Democratic Party low wage labor policy which requires the rapid race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority with Hindu legal immigrant scab labor.</p>
<p>Post-1965 high fertility nonwhites are the number one threat to America&rsquo;s wildlife and ecosytsems. If post-1965 legal immigration is not shut down to 0, and if the various post-1965 nonwhite racial fifth columns-such as the Hindus in our America-are not deported, there will be over time major ecological collapse in &#8220;America&#8221; resulting in the collapse of the Native Born White American population  in the White regions of the former America. If you do not understand this obvious point, then you haven&rsquo;t a clue about ecology.</p>

		<p>This even happens in the Big Sur country of Mexifornia!  I was hiking up a remote stream, the Little Sur River, and found Hindus doing the same thing, a good 1/2 mile up a fairly rugged trail!  And there was old junk there indicating they had been there before.  No place is safe from them.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;   I think about this daily.  The environment on this continent is toast.  The breakup will happen sooner than most realize.  Woe to those caught up in the fault zones.  It will be nasty for white people in general.  Other nations will be drawn in and feed on the corpse of the once proud USA.</p>
<p>Hindus in India pray to statues of elephants, rats and 8-armed gods and drink cow urine and follow swamis with ash rubbed on their faces.  They have all the backward customs of the third world plus latent traditions of widow-burning, treating daughters-in-law like slaves, etc.  </p>
<p>What, did liberals think they would leave all that behind when they came here?  A few did, but just as continued mexican immigration prevents native-born mexicans from assimilating, the influx of fresh-off-the-boats is doing the same thing for the hindus and others.</p>

		<p>We used to take our daughter there when she was little. Walk on the beach far enough from Crossbay Blvd so that you don&rsquo;t hear the traffic and it was peaceful as you can get (not including the jets from JFK). When I was a kid my friends and I used to go from Cypress Hills to fish off that bridge. When we moved out of Brooklyn when I was fifteen (guess why) I went even more often, as well as to Forest Park, another jewel of Queens where we also went with our daughter. Parts of that place were taken over by homosexuals for their disgusting compulsions, as well as Chinese people digging up the weeds, among others. </p>
<p>These are the intangible things that made life so great in White America. We didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money when I was growing up yet this is what was available to us. That was the real wealth that could only be had by being White in an all-White place. No more. It is soul-crushing to think about what happened. Now whenever I see any of those grinning little people that have taken over it makes me angry beyond words.</p>

<p>How can 40 members of one family of immigrants be all in this country?  There used to be quotas that kept the immigration numbers manageable.  Now they are coming here in droves.</p>

		<p>NONwhite immigration has been coming here by the millions for decades now. Since the infamous 1965 Immigration Act to be exact&hellip;.</p>
<p>Chief among national concerns was total numeric immigration. Senate floor manager and Camelot knight-errant Ted Kennedy assured jittery senators that &#8220;our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually.&#8221; Senator Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, further calmed that august body, insisting &#8220;the total number of potential immigrants would not be changed very much.&#8221; Time has proven otherwise. Average immigration levels before the 1965 amendments took effect hovered around 300,000 per annum. Yet 1,045,000 legal immigrants flooded our cities in 1996 alone.</p>

		<p>The most fundamental reason for opposing post-1965 immigration policy is the race-replacement issue. But there are other reasons for opposing it. One would think that  knowing that 1) post-1965 nonwhites are the number one reason for explosive population growth in America and 2) knowing that the water shortage situation in America 20011 and in the near future is  very precarious would be reason enough to ignite millions of Native Born White Americans into a state of stark-raving panic and fear to the point of calling for 0 legal immigration and mass deportations of all post-1965 nonwhites..but it hasn&rsquo;t. But the reality of the situation in &#8220;America&#8221; 2011 is that the inevitable ecological collapse of America and the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority go hand-in-hand. This must stated incessantly the public appearances of Native Born White American Patriots.</p>
<p>I just heard on the BBC news this morning that the NYC rat population is exploding in size..this is occurring at the very same time that the NYC nonwhite youth population is exploding&hellip;NYC is a festering petri dish for the next great pandemic that will sweep across America.</p>
<p>The post-1965 nonwhites of course will want to flee the filthy pool NYC&hellip;right into the rural White communities of upstate NY. </p>
<p>The way to reverse the demographic situation in America is to implement a cordon sanitaire policy..trap the nonwhites in the filthy urban areas&hellip;give them an incentive to self-deport.</p>
<p>This will never happen unless millions of Native Born White Americans become highly racialized..in a very in-your-face-way..it will take a series of catastrophic events to ignite the racial consciousness of millions of Native Born White Americans. This won&rsquo;t happen if secessionists offer them the false hope of running off to Idaho and Montana. The fact of the matter is, Native Born White Americans really can&rsquo;t flee the looming mega-catastrophes on the American horizon.</p>

<p>However&hellip;</p>
<p>Hindus need a society that is designed around Hindu practices. Anything else and they will come into conflict with the majority population.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an issue so much of third world versus first as the fact that two (or more) cultures cannot occupy the same design of civilization.</p>

Except we can never regain what was lost. With a hideous gaggle of third-worlders having replaced Euro-Americans, there is nothing to turn back to. <br>

<p>Never let the race-replacement enthusiasts-the Hindus in our America for example-define the terms of the debate. Native Born White American racial interests completely define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;. It follows from this that are no economic,ecological and cultural reasons for race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority with high fertility post-1965 Hindus,Sihks,Muslims,Hmomg,Africans,Carribeans and Hispanics. Any who thinks it is justifiable to race-replace the Native Born White American Majority is a racist. Tell them this&hellip;right to their face. This is how you deal with the racism charge. </p>
<p>Now, the race-replacement enthusiast will blather out something about the Native Americans and genocide. Just point out all the ethnic cleansing and genocides that occured in Ameridian North America and Ameridian Meso America over a twenty-sixteen thousand year period.  And if you saw the show &#8220;Naked Science&#8221; last night you would have learned of the new evidence that Ameridians in North America were highly likely engaging in genocidal acts aginst other racial groups that had arrived in North American sixteen thousand-twenty thousand years ago..racial groups such as the European one from prehistoric France&hellip;and Kenniwick Man. </p>
<p>Ameridians were not native to America and not Americans for America did not exist sixteen-twenty thousand years ago.</p>

<p>If John McCain had been elected on Nov 8 2008, blacks would have gone on a violent rampage that night-especially if the election was a very close call&hellip;especially if it was a repeat of the 2000 election. I would not want to be in Hyde Park Chicago that night if this had occured. The Liberal  White College Teenagers in the park that night  would have been a very dangerous situation. Gore Vidal in an interview after the election stated that this would have happend if McCain won the election. I think Gore Vidal was stating the obvious. McCain&rsquo;s election would have ignited a race-war. If this had happened, there would very likely have been a complete shutdown of post-1965 immigration policy-or at least we would been much further down the road to a complete shutdown of post-1965 immigration policy. Liberal Immigration Reformers would have been swept aside also&hellip;all their lies would have been exposed.</p>

<p>Er&hellip; not really. Ordinary people do not see &#8216;race-replacement&rsquo; occurring, because we do not see the issue in racial terms in the first place. We only see people choosing where they want to live. Racist is one thing we are definitely not.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;model minority&#8221;   &mdash;   as supposedly enlightened conservatives call Asians   &mdash;   once again are proving their lack of assimilability.  Indians are no better than the Orientals, and some ways worse.  </p>
<p>Hygiene is a perfect example.  The Japanese or Chinese present their own assimilation problems, but say this for them:  They are well-mannered, polite and clean.  They respect property.  A great many Indians, by contrast, are slobs.  Back in bygone days, if anyone was caught taking a dump on public grounds, that person would be arrested in a New York minute.  Now it&rsquo;s just considered doing one&rsquo;s business.  Unbelievable, even for NYC.</p>

<p> &mdash;  &mdash;  &#8220;I think about this daily. The environment on this continent is toast. The breakup will happen sooner than most realize. Woe to those caught up in the fault zones. It will be nasty for white people in general. Other nations will be drawn in and feed on the corpse of the once proud USA.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the feeding is going on today.  It is just that the feeding is going while the thing is dying.</p>

		<p>Well, that solves my wonder about the actual Ganges River.  The glaciers that feed that river are in the Himalayas and are shrinking fast.  There will be obvious practical impacts when that happens, but I have often thought that Hinduism and Indian culture would go mad when that river dries up.  But now I know that they can transfer that sacredness to any river in the world.</p>

		<p>I forgot to mention that when I got to India, fairly often, I am aghast at the way they trash their own country.  Litter piled high everywhere.  They still are living with the mindset from a simpler time when everything was bio-degradable.  </p>

		<p>Take pictures.  Better yet _video_.  When the time comes, VIRALIZE THEM.</p>
<p>Whether you believe in white separation as I do or racewar as Jupiter7 and others seem to advocate, we will need every piece of propaganda at our disposal to stay alive and have just cause for dictating the terms of our own future.</p>

		<p>Comments I found on a blog about the Asian impact in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&rsquo;s one for you, we bought a house in Niles area of Fremont last year and there are a couple of small lakes at a park about a block away all last winter we have flocks of ducks and geese flying low down our street heading into the lakes. One these had hundreds of turtles all over it as is was shallow with lots of fallen trees for them to sun on, it was great walking there in the evenings. Then the goddamn asians found the place, over a weeks time it went from seeing a couple of groups 3 or 4 dotted around lake looking intently at the turtles and ducks to multiple mobs of 20 or more of these people with fishing poles and buckets jostling for space around the lake. Within 3 weeks there wasn&rsquo;t a turtle to be found anywhere, the resident duck population was almost gone and we haven&rsquo;t heard any flights of the geese or ducks this year at all. Another note on these bastards we can&rsquo;t really prove is there&rsquo;s been a sharp increase in locals losing there pets in the last 6 months or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>That pretty much sums it up for everyone.</p>
