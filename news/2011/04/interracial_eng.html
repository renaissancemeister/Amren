	<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>The Interracial Engagement Scenario</strong>: What would you do if you witnessed an interracial couple telling both sets of parents that they intended to get married, and instead of hearing a loving, joyful reception, you heard clear bigotry? To find out we went to Edison Diner, in Middlesex County, N.J., with our hidden cameras. We hired actors to play an interracial couple and four other actors to play their parents. Would anyone try to talk some sense into the parents?</p>

		<p>I would applaud the parents!  I have a cousin who 20 years ago dated a black girl.  He was thrown out of the house and told not to come back until she was gone.  He now has a white wife and daughter.  My Aunt and Uncle won.  And other white parents could win as well.  It takes backbone and resolve.</p>

		<p>This is just another way that the word &#8220;programming&#8221; has more than one meaning. This television show is giving people the idea that they must intervene if they see something that they do not agree with or they will be &#8220;racists and bigots&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sure, this is catering to the progaram&rsquo;s liberal/feminist audience, but seriously who would walk up to total strangers and start playing Jerry Springer? Women might only get verbal abuse, but men would be asking for serious trouble. </p>

		<p>&#8220;What would you do&#8221; is nothing more than a program made by left-wingers obsessed with the holy trinity of liberalism; Racism, sexism and homophobia. In addition to programs which imply that only bigoted yokels are against interracial marriage, they&rsquo;ll act out on camera fictitious public scenes where a hispanic is  the victim of a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; or gays are being verbally &#8216;bashed&rsquo; at a bar, all to show how joe or jane six-pack fail to react correctly. </p>

		<p>Wow! I watched the video and then read the two comments on the ABC website. The first comment was from &#8220;Wlkelly98&#8221;, I assume, a white man. He said he would discourage it and tell his daughter to observe the poor history that black males have had with women. Another woman wrote: </p>

As the daughter, niece, sister, aunt,, grand daughter, great grand daughter of black men who are and were excellent husbands and fathers, I truly resent your statement Wlkelly98&hellip;exactly how many black men do you really know???</p>

I don&rsquo;t think race matters, I&rsquo;ve gone out with white guys. I&rsquo;ve gone out with black guys. I&rsquo;ve gone out with really nice white guys, really nice black guys. But I have also gone out with horrible white and black guys. What does color have to do with personality? Interracial marriage is not a &#8220;trend&#8221; it is love. I am a white girl, and I see nothing wrong with going out with someone who doesn&rsquo;t look like me. I completely disagree with wlkelly98</p>
<p>Problem? Yeah! wlkelly98&rsquo;s comment was removed. So much for free speech. Thanks ABC.</p>

		<p>That would have been great if the actor playing the father had rattled off all the reasons why it&rsquo;s a horrible idea  &mdash;  the broken families, the underperforming, resentful children, the far greater likelihood of being beaten by the husband, the likelihood of being cheated on, etc. But of course I wouldn&rsquo;t expect all that in a piece of propaganda. Nor do I expect them to show the &#8220;father&#8221; being commiserated with by the other diners in the parking lot.</p>

		<p>This show is quite entertaining sometimes. It&rsquo;s always so refreshing to hear the &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;bigot&#8221; speaking openly and honestly and people around them reacting positively. In real life very very few people have the guts to do that, and you can see on the show that some of the people really support the &#8220;bigot&#8221; for their courage and integrity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the show itself has no integrity whatsoever, and never looks into whether the &#8220;racism&#8221; would have been correct or justified in real life.</p>

		<p>Well I just got through watching that segment, and I have to be honest I am not surprised at the reaction. I am from this town, and I even eat at that diner. Edison, NJ is a stone&rsquo;s throw away from New Brunswick, NJ and the most violent anti-white activists in the country, including One People&rsquo;s Project that started there. They couldn&rsquo;t have choreographed this better if they tried.</p>

		<p>On the flip side, what does it say about you if you&rsquo;re a person who buts into other people&rsquo;s business at private tables in a restaurant?</p>
<p>How ridiculously implausible.  I mean seriously, who does that?  &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t help but overhear your conversation and took it upon myself to let you know you&rsquo;re horrible for not wanting your daughter to be pumped full of black babies.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What would I do?  Honestly, I&rsquo;d look around for the hidden camera.  That&rsquo;s what I do these days whenever anything odd happens in public.   </p>
<p>That skit was so obviously faked, as most of them are. Whites are so very cowed anymore that when one does speak out, something is probably going on. Blacks misbehaving in public is pretty normal, but whites acting badly in public is either a sign of some mental problem, or&hellip; there&rsquo;s a camera somewhere.  </p>

		<p>I posted this on the ABC article&rsquo;s comment section:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some fun facts:</p>
<p>* The spousal homicide rate among blacks is 8.4 times more than for whites.</p>
<p>* The incidence of spousal homicide is 7.7 times higher in interracial marriages compared to intraracial marriages. (If you only included white intraracial marriages this number is even higher).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2011 guys (a liberal&rsquo;s favorite strawman), when will blacks learn it&rsquo;s not okay to kill their spouses?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doubt they&rsquo;ll approve it though. Can&rsquo;t have facts on a major news publication.</p>

		<p>Bigotry means intolerance.  I am not a bigot for being against mixed race couples or homosexual couples. I can tolerate one&rsquo;s behavior or lifestyle choices and be respectful without liking it.  Instead of getting self-righteous and calling us &#8216;racists&rsquo; and &#8216;bigots&rsquo; perhaps they can explain why their choices are good ones?  If they were even so secure with being in a mixed race relationship, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to rub it in our faces and call us &#8216;bigots&rsquo; for simply not liking what they do.</p>

		<p>This show, &#8220;What Would You Do?&#8221; is the crudest,  most blatantly anti-white propaganda show on TV.  It&rsquo;s really something out of Orwell.  It features a constant stream of &#8220;poor minorities suffering racism&#8221; stories.  The producers of this show had to step over the bodies of thousands of whites murdered and raped to put this propaganda tripe on the air.  When you have a show that ignores the vast majority of victims of racist violence and highlights the comparatively small number of crimes against the groups that actually commit the most racial violence you can only conclude that the show is consciously promoting violence against the group they ignore.  </p>

		<p>Again, why would a White man with half a brain ask the opinion of some stranger in a restaurant, a woman young enough to be his daughter???  Of course she gives the standard answer that conditioned young white women usually give, and that is that as long as he loves her and treats her right, then everything is okay.  Talk about a feminized society.  A man who should know better asks the advice of some young &#8220;twit&#8221;.  This is supposed to be an example to other White men who think of acting like this man.  It&rsquo;s supposed to say to them, &#8220;Look.  Go seek out the advice of some girl young enough to be your daughter, because she holds all the wisdom you need.  And there will be so-called &#8220;men&#8221; who actually let this sort of thing condition their mind to accept a situation like the one presented here.<br>

		<p>This is a lot of contrived nonsense.  Any parent that was opposed to interracial marriage wouldn&rsquo;t let their daughter date someone like that in first place.  The two women in the booth next to them are most likely actors as well even though they want you to believe they&rsquo;re not.  </p>

		<p>Why should they be happy? Black men &#8216;date&rsquo; white women at a rate that seems around 10 times higher than white men date black women. Add in the other races and most black children end up being raised in a &#8216;ghetto&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Where are the diversitoids on this inequality? The rate of &#8216;disparate impact&rsquo; must not be high enough on this one, or it must not be an important enough issue. Apparently, we need to see even more &#8216;integration&rsquo;. I guess only black men and white women really count as &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine people interfering in strangers&rsquo; private family affairs in a restaurant!  Is it because I&rsquo;m old-fashioned, from the South, or what?  Did the people who set up this ruse really expect other diners to jump up and intervene?<br>
Apparently, this is nothing more than another piece of leftist propaganda aimed at teaching readers that the parents&rsquo; objections are so outrageous that total strangers must step in!  Every news item that comes from the left is carefully examined and manipulated to indoctrinate.  For example: this morning I asked my husband to tell me if the cable news channels had any reports about either the white girl beaten at McD&rsquo;s or the crossdressing man beaten in a restroom.  He just informed me that MSNBC showed a few seconds of a video showing the latter.  He said he couldn&rsquo;t perceive whether the attackers were black or not.  No doubt, MSNBC wanted to showcase the beating of a crossdresser without letting anyone know blacks did it.  Imagine the conspiring that goes on every day to produce this stuff!</p>

		<p>@OleWhiteLady- I was raised much the same way, unless you see someone getting physically assaulted and call the police you leave people&rsquo;s personal business alone. If this had been a real scenario the interloper would have likely been told to kiss off if not physically assaulted. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they have asian parents with a daughter who wants to marry a black guy?  Oh, because that would present asians in a negative light.  Only older white folks (crusty, stodgy and behind the times) can be bigots.</p>
<p>And like others have said, why do black guys ONLY go for white girls who have BLOND hair?  I have NEVER seen a black white couple in which the female had black hair.</p>

		<p>My niece dated and then married a black man.  In the family, everyone but me accepted this situation.  She gave birth to twins, and everyone but me acted like they were thrilled, especially my parents.  Not very long after, my niece learned that her husband was having an affair with yet another white woman.  She divorced him and now my sister is raising the kids, defending her daughter and doting on her mulatto grandchildren.  No one seems to have learned anything.  I think this is a national epidemic.</p>

		<p>This show is extremely sneaky.  Amid all this busy-body pc hogwash they pepper in some possible crimes.  In one such episode, a sober man tries to literally drag a drunk woman, who is a stranger, away from the bar.  To me, this looks like the beginnings of a crime in progress, to which I *would* step in and call the police to sort out.  We should all have the courage to step up to crime; it is the opposite of the mentality blacks like to call &#8220;no snitching.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
However, 99% of the other hokey scenarios on this show are either against the pc gods or are simply in bad taste, and it is no one&rsquo;s business to butt-in.</p>
<p>I believe the message of this show &#8220;To be a good citizen you must interfere in other peoples&rsquo; affairs&#8221; is a horrible message and the opposite of truth.</p>

		<p>Australia promotes inter-racial marriage big-time as well.  My biggest problem with it is that it tends to be a one-way street. White men have a huge selection of females while the available males for white women is less. </p>
<p>The Asian women / white male is a big thing in Australia. From my observation, as lot of the relationships between a non-citizen Asian female and citizen white male end in shot-gun marriages. My concern is that the young men involved only see the &#8216;actress&rsquo; side of their Asian bride, and once citizenship is granted the real side of the women comes out, and if he doesn&rsquo;t like it, they can get divorced. She has the golden egg, and that is all that matters.</p>
<p>For white women, there seems to be less white males, and the issue with the non-white males if that a lot either come from mysogynist cultures or they are only going to marry someone from the their own group and see white women as &#8216;play things&rsquo; but not suitable for marriage. </p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;d be keen to marry someone who came from a different culture. </p>

		<p>I have a friend, a white male. He fathered 3 mulatto children with a black woman.  A few years later, they broke up, and she and the 3 children moved to Florida. Every time he and I had a conservation, he would use the N word more times than Mark Furman did in the infamous recording at the OJ Simpson trial.</p>

		<p>Wow! This whole thing is just hidden agenda social engineering. As if the couple would have been dating all this time and yet somehow been blissfully unaware of the girl&rsquo;s parents attitude and views. How utterly implausible. Note how the show is hosted by a non-white. Note how the couple is the ever more wearisome BM/WF. Note how the women who intervened (when common sense would suggest prudence, i.e. minding your own business, your dealing with total strangers in a volatile situation) is presented as some kind of &#8220;virtuous&#8221; person. Such drivel&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Because I am a history buff, and a natural history buff it is easy for me to think in terms of hundreds of years, thousands of years, and millions of years.<br>
 <br>
Homo sapiens is a species in a process of arrested differentiation. The question is not whether the races will merge, but how soon. My guess is that it will take a thousand years, give or take a few hundred. Because superior intelligence is becoming increasingly necessary in order to earn a decent income the existing races will not be equally represented in the future hybrid, but genes from each will be present. <br>
 <br>
The result will be one race with a tawny complexion. Some people will have blond or red hair, and/or blue, grey, or green eyes.  Nost will have dark hair and brown eyes. The average IQ will be about 120. </p>

<p>My niece dated and then married a black man. In the family, everyone but me accepted this situation. She gave birth to twins, and everyone but me acted like they were thrilled, especially my parents. Not very long after, my niece learned that her husband was having an affair with yet another white woman. She divorced him and now my sister is raising the kids, defending her daughter and doting on her mulatto grandchildren. No one seems to have learned anything. I think this is a national epidemic.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>This scenario is so common nowadays. I also have a family member that ADOPTED 2 African children from Africa. My own brother is now a great grandpa to these kids. </p>
<p>I have also noticed that it is the WHITE side that takes in these mulatto kids and just swoons all over them as if they are sooo special over the White kids. I cannot understand what these White people are even thinking, let alone having such misguided &#8220;love and compassion&#8221; for them but not for their own flesh and blood. They &#8220;think&#8221; they are &#8220;good&#8221; people, but in reality they will face judgment one day and it will not be good. </p>
<p>My brother is sooo proud of his grandaughter and her husband that went to Africa and brought them home. (They have 2 White children of their own) He pays way more attention to the black kids than to his own biological great grandkids! That angered me more than anything.  I hated even going to family reunions seeing them there and everyone trying not to be &#8220;racist&#8221; fawned over those kids. It made me ill. </p>
<p>I lost all respect for my brother ever since and I am very reserved whenever I have to come into contact with him, which is very seldom now since I don&rsquo;t go where I think he and his family may be.</p>

<p>If it was soooo hard, why didn&rsquo;t he and his family go back to their beloved Mexico? Anyway, everything seems to have turned out pretty well for him in this &#8216;racisss&rsquo; America. As a White man, I dought they&rsquo;d let me host a show in Mexico questioning THEIR racial pride.</p>

<p>Exactly!! I&rsquo;m really sick of these non-Whites coming to this country thinking they&rsquo;re just as much an American as we are. Trust me, if you ask anyone in the world to picture an American, they would picture a White person, not a non-White. Just as I would picture an Hispanic if I were ask to picture a Mexican or an Asian if asked to picture a Japanese person. I&rsquo;ve told several of them that &#8220;just because you&rsquo;ve got your &#8216;papers&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll NEVER be a REAL American in MY eyes!&#8221; Talk about if looks could kill! I could live my whole life in a non-White country and STILL never be considered a REAL citizen of that country by the natives.

		<p>The whole thing is scripted and the woman who they claim is an innocent bystander is another actor or person paid to recite that dialogue.  It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re objective and going to show a person with a well-reasoned argument against it.  It has to fit their agenda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way too cliche.  &#8220;This day and age,&#8221; and &#8220;they&rsquo;re ignorant.&#8221;  How many times is that type of nonsense prattled about.</p>

		<p>When is the last time you saw anyone make a family scene in public and a complete stranger just walked up to them and started consoling them?  People mind their own business and if such an odd thing ever happened to me I would definitely put them in their place and wouldn&rsquo;t care about their opinion either. They&rsquo;re trying to condition people to believe that this stranger&rsquo;s reaction is a totally normal spontaneous event when in fact there are five actors in this film not four.  This video is almost as funny as the black Barbie doll story AMREN featured about a week ago.  The makers of this film might have tipped their hand because it&rsquo;s not a big leap to believe that there are a lot of these actors out in the public as well.  If you see a beautiful blonde with a black or a White male supermodel type ignoring the pretty White girls in the store and flirting with the &#8220;sistas&#8221;, use some good old fashioned common sense.<br>

<p>This latest attempted at social-engineering-by-cathode-ray is even more offensive than when NBC sent full-dress Muslims and some hidden cameras to a NASCAR event a few years back. They were hoping to catch some &#8220;Southern bigots&#8221; and &#8220;dumb rednecks&#8221; being mean to the Muslims sitting amongst them in the stands. Much to NBC&rsquo;s chagrin, the white NASCAR fans totally ignored the Muslims, treated them like anybody else, and just watched the race that they came to watch. </p>
<p>Both on that NASCAR show, and in this new interracial-marriage one, Whites are Presumed Guilty. Neither of these shows would even have a reason to exist if the producers weren&rsquo;t expecting to get some juicy footage of &#8220;intolerant&#8221; behavior from us horrible awful white &#8220;rayciss&#8221;. </p>
<p>Two things: (1) These televised social experiments are nothing less than entrapment; and (2) No other group besides whites is ever targeted in this way. </p>

		<p>I used to work w/a girl who only dated Hispanics. She is not what I would call attractive, but she is a nice person and gainfully employed with a solid career. She would go to (mostly Hispanic) clubs and the guys treated her like a prom queen,  clamoring for her attention. She told me that it wasn&rsquo;t that she didn&rsquo;t like white guys, but that they wouldn&rsquo;t give her the time of day. </p>
<p>I asked male co-workers and friends to fix her up with some of their white friends and their response was always the same: she&rsquo;s not attractive enough.  They didn&rsquo;t care that she was nice, friendly and held a steady job.  </p>
<p>A plain-looking white girl who has been ignored by white men her entire life is going to eat up the attention given to her by non-whites and end up like her. </p>

		<p>In inter-faith marriages where a white Jewish man marries a non-Jewish white woman, the children have four acceptable choices.</p>
<p>1. Go through the long and difficult process it takes to formally<br>
takes to convert to Judaism and join their father&rsquo;s synagogue.</p>
<p>2. Become a Christian by accepting Jesus Christ and joining their mother&rsquo;s church.</p>
<p>3. Be like me and such famous freethinkers as Mark Twain and Thomas Jefferson, by not having any religion at all.  I am member of the Freedom from Religion Foundation.</p>
<p>4. Practice another different religion entirely.  For example, actor Richard Gere is a convert to Buddhism.</p>
<p>But with either choice, the offspring of such inter-faith marriages will still be able to be part of white society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the children of inter-racial marriages between an black man and a white women, do not have such options.  They cannot choose to be black or white.  They are robbed of what should have been their white heritage.  This is an awful thing to impose on these children, who did not choose to be born in this kind of difficult situation.</p>

<p>I would also posit the theory that these women have black girlfriends they hang around with.  There&rsquo;s one black woman at work that lots of people make polite conversation with but her only real friend seems to be this unattractive, overweight and low class White woman that she hangs around with.  The black woman is single with lots of children and I would be willing to wager that these kinds of friendships are how these women are coming into contact with black men they wouldn&rsquo;t normally do so.  The lack of breeding and social moors, the dumbing down of America and increased immorality is what is putting lots of these women on equal footing with these low class blacks.  <br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t care what that sweet harmless white lady SAYS she would do, we all know what she would be THINKING if her young daughter brought home a black guy and announced that she was getting engaged.</p>
<p>ABC is playing on the worst tendencies regarding race that white people have today. We&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated that racism is one of the worst things possible, to the point where we have to step up and meddle in the non-criminal affairs of families of strangers. And yet to varying degrees we all have the same reservations as the father. We have those reservations for a good reason, our guts tell us what the facts confirm:</p>
<p>• Interracial marriages are more likely to fail. </p>
<p>• Black men are much less likely to make good committed long term husbands and fathers. </p>
<p>• White women are pursued by non-white men for all the wrong reasons, they&rsquo;re objectified and seen as trophies by non-whites.</p>
<p>• Multiracial children face a host of problems including mental and physical health problems. </p>
<p>• Just because there&rsquo;s a concerted media effort to &#8220;normalize&#8221; interracial couplings doesn&rsquo;t mean it is wrong for us white people to follow our natural desire to be with our own and have children that look like us.</p>
<p>Rather than try to guilt trip and bully white people into repressing our very appropriate fears and concerns about interracial coupling, ABC News should show some respect and acknowledge that people partner within their racial groups quite naturally and there&rsquo;s NOTHING wrong with that. Set ups like these are intended to confuse and demoralize us in order to make us doubt our natural impulses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s liberal mainstream media social engineering, plain as day.</p>

<p> A piece of paper from our corrupt traitorous government means NOTHING when given to nonwhite &#8220;immigrants&#8221;. The Founders would NEVER have allowed this to happen and I am sure they would call us all fools if they could see the America they founded FOR Whites only. Their PROGENY! A Black, Asian, Mexican, Arab, etc. cannot be the progeny of our White founders, period. TWO Whites cannot produce a nonwhite baby, only White babies, as God intended it to be. <br>

		<p>We raised one of my daughters children whose father was a black man. Wouldn&rsquo;t do it again. She also had another child with another black man but we refused to raise that one.</p>
<p>In both cases there was no offer of support in any form, in fact the men wouldn&rsquo;t admit to being the father.</p>
<p>After 17 years of raising our grandchild and being involved with the black community so she would have exposure too both races we have been disowned by her. </p>
<p>Raising any child must be a dedication, an effort of caring, the financial aspect is just part of the equation. When she was eighteen the father shows up and what I call the &#8220;black dance&#8221; (no effort just a lot of rhetoric) he brain washes the child.</p>
<p>Bottom line, I met very few black men that are responsible even to black women. Also, white women who pursue black men have serious problems so &#8220;Tit for Tat&#8221;.</p>

I think you missed a button on your calculator, john&hellip;I&rsquo;m not trying to insult you here, but:<br>
how do we end up with an average human IQ of 120 when the highest IQ humans (Whites and North Asians)  are a minority, black and brown populations are exploding, and the intelligent groups aforementioned only have an average IQ of about 100 to 105 anyway? <br>
Add to this the abysmally low average IQ of blacks/ browns, from the 80s to the 70s, and their greater population size&hellip; without even whipping out the calculator, I&rsquo;d hazard a guess (in your nightmare scenario of a lost white race) that the &#8220;tawnies&#8221; would be a huge race of dullards with IQs averaging 85 to 90.<br>

If you are interested in genetics, then you have to know, that together with darker skin and race mixing, an overall decrease of the average IQ would result. High IQ will be approximately as rare as a person with blue eyes.<br>
These days, there is no higher fertility of people with higher IQ, quite the opposite, and no cvhange of this trend is in sight. Therefore no selection pressure exists towards the right of the Gaussian curve. <br>
Welcome to a swarthy Idiocracy.</p>

		<p>The controlled media&rsquo;s endless drumbeat for miscegenation, with particular emphasis on black male/white female, seems to be unending  &mdash;   I see it constantly on network television. If everyone is multi-racial how could anyone by racist? The liberal fools actually believe this nonsense. I&rsquo;m also not surprised by the brainwashed young white women who offered their unwanted opinions/sympathy to the &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; couple. I agree people should mind their own business in public family squabbles, even fake ones like this one.    </p>

<p>Homo sapiens is a species in a process of arrested differentiation. The question is not whether the races will merge, but how soon. My guess is that it will take a thousand years, give or take a few hundred. Because superior intelligence is becoming increasingly necessary in order to earn a decent income the existing races will not be equally represented in the future hybrid, but genes from each will be present.</p>
<p>The result will be one race with a tawny complexion. Some people will have blond or red hair, and/or blue, grey, or green eyes. Nost will have dark hair and brown eyes. The average IQ will be about 120.</p>

I think you missed a button on your calculator, john&hellip;I&rsquo;m not trying to insult you here, but:<br>
how do we end up with an average human IQ of 120 when the highest IQ humans (Whites and North Asians) are a minority, black and brown populations are exploding, and the intelligent groups aforementioned only have an average IQ of about 100 to 105 anyway? <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
It took the Ashkenazic Jews less than a thousand years to evolve to an average IQ of 112-115. Of course, they started at what must have been slightly less than 100 during the ancient world.<br>
 <br>
Because the world economy is evolving in ways that reward superior intelligence, I am assuming that those without it will find it increasingly difficult to have children who survive and reproduce. Perhaps 120 is too high. Let&rsquo;s lower that to about 110. The average will still be higher than it is now because of the selection process. <br>
 <br>
During the next thousand years the human population may crash because of a nuclear war or ecological catastrophes. In such a situation, I would expect the survivors to be quite a bit more intelligent on the average than those unable to survive. They will not only have more economic resources to sustain them, but they will be innately more resourceful. </p>

<p>People were not so ignorant back then.  They didn&rsquo;t have those anti-miscegenation laws out of hatred or bigotry.  They knew (and Lincoln mentioned) the differences between blacks and whites.</p>
<p>I grew up in a somewhat left-leaning home, but I always took it for granted I&rsquo;d marry a white man.  The idea of ending up with a black man never sat well with me.</p>

<p> Remember those that claimed he was the father of Sally Hemmings child (children)?  Come to find out from DNA testing that it was NOT Thomas Jefferson as the father but one of his relatives?  Even Amren has an article about this LIE!  Look it up in archives.</p>
<p><br>
In the Constitution or Declaration of Ind., it states that the U.S. was made for us and OUR posterity. That would be Whites of European decent. Later if you look at the Naturalization Acts ( Immigration Acts ) of 1790 - 1795 and I think 1800 and 1805. Congress, and remember these are the Founding Fathers. Said that in order to be a U.S. citizen, you had to be a free WHITE person.</p>

		<p>@ John Engelman,</p>
<p>Something to consider: You cannot create a condition where IQ improves at the same time it&rsquo;s racial presence lessens.  If the percentage of blacks to whites (8.9 and 35) continues to unbalance, what will happen is that white genes, which are biased towards the longview, will be eradicated in a &#8216;everyone get your own!&rsquo; predatory culture which _does not reward_ the social conditions  which white genes both _need_ and support in staying relevant.</p>
<p>Unless the environment specifically supports a given specialization, selection sir is towards the generalist and away from the specialist, with modification for task difficulty.  House cats get a mouse or a grasshopper or a bird or or or just about 1 in 3.  Screech Owls and Cheetahs do about the same because they are so highly evolved towards prey compatibility with ONE species (barn mice and gazelle calves).  Leopards do about 1 in 5 and Lions do about 1 in 7.  The difference being that, if 7 lions hunt, one is almost certain to bring down game big enough for all to eat well.</p>
<p>But whether times are tough or not, the lions will, upon encountering them, -deliberately- kill all the leopards and cheetahs they encounter in their range.  Usually through their cubs.</p>
<p>Blacks in numbers are a lion threat.  Whites in their specialities are a cheetah victim.</p>
<p>And the society you envision in 1,000 years will be one which has &#8216;somehow&rsquo; bypassed the meltdown of 103 nuclear reactors which are not properly maintained or shut down, inside the USA alone.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see the world the way you do sir.  I think it&rsquo;s a perversion to assume &#8216;everything will turn out all right in the end&rsquo; when _white people_ have created the only culture which even tries to control it&rsquo;s numbers and conserve it&rsquo;s environment.  I think it&rsquo;s much more likely, given the huge environmental destruction being wrought, that we will see another in the &#8216;99.999% of all species are extinct&rsquo; events.  As humans, at the top, become the barometer species for how sick the environment overall has become.</p>
<p>To which the only realistic response is:  If it&rsquo;s them or us, better us.  Through separation.</p>
<p>I do not believe (because nature doesn&rsquo;t suggest it) that mankind has a &#8216;common destiny&rsquo;.  I think it is far more likely that species radiate (your word is arrested differentiation but _differentiation_ it is) and those which are not capable of keeping up are lost.  We are at that point.</p>
<p>Mankind is not coincident in our evolutationary pathways.  And the pathway that Africans have adopted _only works_ in the horrors of Africa as it was, 2,000-30,000 years ago.</p>

<p>  I really don&rsquo;t see this as being more common in my neck of the woods: the Deep South. A significant difference is most white males are marrying the East Asian females, where blacks more frequently just cohabit with the white females, who have their mixed children out of wedlock. </p>

<p>IF Thomas Jefferson really said that, then he wasn&rsquo;t a very bight man, was he? In fact, I would say he was either lying or did not say it all. Remember they DID lie about him being the father of Hemmings children. They even claimed they had proof.   This MYTH that most White Americans have Indian blood in them is just that, a MYTH! They want us all to believe that interracial marriages are &#8220;good&#8221; so they keep repeating the lie over and again. Most of us here on Amren KNOW what &#8220;mixing the blood&#8221; will do to the White race and we want no part of it!  Even those White men who marry Asian women and have children are mixing their bloodline. It as just as bad as the White women going with black men! WE need to PRESERVE our bloodline since we are only 8% of the total world population, don&rsquo;t you think? I don&rsquo;t know if you read or even understand the Bible,(even most of today&rsquo;s Christians don&rsquo;t) but God does forbid mixing the bloodline HE created.</p>

<p>Jim. So the relationships between black men and white women which happen to be &#8216;stable and loving&rsquo; are also OK in your book?</p>

<p><i>&#8220;The biological clock for men is longer, a white guy can change his mind later less likely for a white girl.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>After the white guy has already had several mixed race children with the Asian girl? That OK with you.</p>
<p><br>
Jim, I assume is a white nationalist. He has friends who are married to Asian women. He obviously does not disapprove.</p>
<p>Would posters to this message board be similarly insouciant about say a hypothetical white women Jean, who has many female friends in relationships with black men (which happen to be &#8216;loving&rsquo;), and who would defend them?</p>
<p>Somehow I think not.</p>
<p>Peoples feelings here range from understanding to neutral when it comes to white men with Asian women.</p>
<p>But range from strong disapproval to outright hatred when it comes to white women with black men.</p>
<p>This is hypocrisy, and needs to be seriously addressed.</p>

Wayne, just because there&rsquo;s not the same level of &#8220;visceral revulsion&#8221; dosen&rsquo;t mean white people are generally in favor of white men mating with Oriental women. We realize that the Races are different, that&rsquo;s what makes us racists. We realize that on average at least Orientals are smarter, better looking and more law abiding than blacks. But all interracial mating leads to the destruction of the white race and if I could out law it I would. I would also promote and make it easier and cheaper to use spearm and egg banks and sarrogate mothers to improve the white race.<br>

I also think &#8220;Jim&#8221; makes an important point: many politically indoctrinated feminist white women have become antagonistic and distrustful of white men. East Asian women, coming from a different culture, don&rsquo;t carry this baggage. With that said, I&rsquo;m for whites marrying among themselves that&rsquo;s why I post to American Renaissance.</p>

 I also didn&rsquo;t say that white men and asaian women had better marriages, I just stated that they seemed to work out better than black on white.<br>
 From a physical stand point, a trip to any supermarket will validate my statement about white women letting themselves go.<br>

<p>&#8220;Other than a Japanese&#8221;?  I take it you are married to a Japanese? That makes your daughter a mixed race if this is so.</p>

		<p>Of course my wife is Japanese and our daughter is a &#8220;Happa&#8221;, but she&rsquo;s not mixed-species, Anonymous-78.</p>

		<p>&#8220;From a physical stand point, a trip to any supermarket will validate my statement about white women letting themselves go.<br>
I each his own but I have no desire to be married to a 400 pound hog with greasy hair who wears stretch pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure there are women that have let themselves go but there are plenty of men who have too with big beer guts and greasy hair. Give me a break.<br>

The above bitter writer is someone with a very jaundiced view of women; and no doubt serious  emotional problems in that area. Not all white women are &#8220;400 pound hogs with greasy hair&#8221;. In fact, those few are the tiny minority.  (I wonder what great shape our writer is in, btw?  One look at him might explain his failure with women.)</p>

		<p>I hate repeating myself here, but I though mostly Celtic, I am also 3/16 northeast woodlands American Indian.  If I had married a white woman, that would irritate most of the same people.  Which way do you want it?</p>

<p>This is confusing. You&rsquo;re saying that you basically consider yourself white, however you have enough non-white in you so that marrying a white woman would have irritated all the fully white, white nationalists. Therefore, you still think of yourself as a white nationalist but one for whom it was okay to marry a non-white Asian woman&hellip; </p>

<p>Spoiler.  Probably not White at all but hanging around to cause dissention.  If you are Indian you are not White.  Feel free to support our cause but please don&rsquo;t marry a White woman.  Sorry, but no exceptions allowed; we don&rsquo;t need aboriginal blood.<br>
