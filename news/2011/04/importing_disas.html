			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Selwyn Duke, American Thinker, April 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In the Financial Times recently, Richard McGregor reported on the latest population data, writing:<blockquote>The electorate has become less white and more Hispanic more rapidly than predicted, according to the national census, two trends that will influence elections for decades.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
</blockquote>{snip} Ironically, while McGregor cites whites&rsquo; lower fertility rate, he doesn&rsquo;t even once mention the 800-lb statist in the middle of the room: immigration. I guess being flooded with unassimilable foreigners is now taken so for granted that it no longer even warrants mention.</p>
<p>What McGregor does do is discuss immigration&rsquo;s effects, as he, quoting the National Journal, asks &#8220;whether Republicans can increase their advantage among whites enough to overcome what is likely to be a growing share of the overall vote cast by minorities [in 2012].&#8221; </p>
<p>The answer?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>As long as we continue our suicidal immigration policies  &mdash;  where 85 percent of newcomers hail from the Third World and Asia (thanks, Ted Kennedy)  &mdash;  the only thing that will be in question about our descent into socialism, and perhaps beyond, is the rate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Remember that people create the government; government doesn&rsquo;t create the people. If you replace Westerners with Muslims, you no longer have Christendom (or even the shell of it we now inhabit) but Iran West. And if you replace apple-pie Americans with I-want-your-piece-of-the-pie socialists, you no longer have the US but the USSR redux. Oh, of course, our immigration scheme isn&rsquo;t replacing us in one fell swoop; instead, it&rsquo;s happening incrementally, {snip}. And a death by a thousand cuts is still a death.</p>
<p>So we may talk about how Tea Parties are &#8220;waking people up,&#8221; but conservatives are asleep; the reality they&rsquo;re ignoring is that there are fewer who can be woken up all the time. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Virtually every time someone complains about illegal migration, it&rsquo;s accompanied by the disclaimer, &#8220;Now, I have no problem with legal immigration .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; In fact, this blind devotion to our colonization (I call this devotion &#8220;immigrationism&#8221;) is so great that warnings about it are usually met with crickets chirping. So I will spell it out.</p>
<p>According to my calculations, on average, groups descended from the new immigrants in question vote for leftists approximately 79 percent of the time. This means that 79 percent of 36.3 percent of the population now supports statists (on top of the whites who do), and the latter figure is up almost 6 points in just 10 years. Soon it will be 79 percent of 40.</p>
<p>Then 79 percent of 50.</p>
<p>Then 60.</p>
<p>And 70, and, well, does anyone get it?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the future? Well, in the 1990s, we had Bill Clinton and many people thought it couldn&rsquo;t get any worse than the Wizard of Is. Eight years after he left office, however, we got Barack Obama, and now, once again, some think it can&rsquo;t get any worse.</p>
<p>But they are wrong.</p>
<p>Just wait until Malia Obama is running.</p>
<p><em>On the right.</em></p>
<p>And who might be running to her left? Well, since our imported socialists come not from Denmark but south of the border, that is where I&rsquo;ll look for possibilities. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, we could get lucky and just end up like Mexico, a kleptocratic, drug-cartel-plagued state with socialist tendencies.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re well on the road to such Third Worldism. Many conservatives are waiting for the next Ronald Reagan, but they miss the point. The question is not &#8220;Where are all the leaders?&#8221; but something else:</p>
<p>Where are all the followers?</p>
<p>Answer: dying off and being replaced.</p>
<p>In 1984, Reagan enjoyed a 49-state landslide victory, losing only Walter Mondale&rsquo;s home state, Minnesota, by a narrow margin. Today, however, he not only would likely lose states such as Massachusetts, Hawaii, Vermont and New York, to name a handful, he wouldn&rsquo;t even carry his home state of California. And consider who Americans elected a mere 20 years after Reagan left office: a man who spent those 20 years sitting in a bigoted, anti-American church; a man with a 2007 voting record to the left of that of the Senate&rsquo;s only avowed socialist (Bernie Sanders). &#8220;And imagine,&#8221; some will say, &#8220;that man, Barack Obama, was elected by the same nation!&#8221;</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Just by people residing within the same borders.</p>
<p>And these are the consequences of not controlling the cultural elements that come into your land and, through the process the Soviets called &#8220;demoralization,&#8221; are raised up out of it.</p>
<p>Of course, my predictions are based on certain assumptions, not the least of which is that there will be an intact American republic to elect a leader in the future. But with how balkanized we are  &mdash;  the left-right and secular-religious divides, groups such as La Raza (the Race) and MEChA and the desire to &#8220;reconquer&#8221; Ca. and the Southwest in Mexico&rsquo;s name  &mdash;  this is not a given. </p>

		<p>Looking back at the behavior of both parties during the last several decades is their ANY evidence whatsoever that it makes even the slightest difference&hellip;.or even that they are the ones who make the decisions.</p>
<p>Look at Obama.  Just look at him objectively for a moment.  Can you seriously see this man in an office somewhere, surrounded by a think tank of individuals, papers, powerpoint presentations and other important sources of information, making informed decisions that effect the outcomes in our nation and in our world.</p>
<p>The very idea makes one burst out laughing, it is so ludicrous.</p>
<p>There are many things going on with immigration.  Shift of power in a democracy is not one of them.  Our country isn&rsquo;t a democracy.  It&rsquo;s a form of communism where the members of the oligarchy are corporations.  Power is maintained through the illusion of the rule of law (where in fact, an elite exercises absolute dictoral powers).  Often, alot of effort is put forth to presenting that veneer.  Elections are a good example.  But it is all show, and more and more often, you are seeing them not bother.</p>
<p>Our current spat with Libia is a good example.  It demonstrates the transnational element of power in the US.  Those who truly rule the country, many of them are from outside the country.  In this example, the UN literally ordered the US to war.  Something that is supposedly outrageous but didn&rsquo;t get more than passing notice.  Congress was not involved.  Or more to the point, those in Congress, who often sit on multiple boards of powerful corporations, were very involved, but didn&rsquo;t bother to make a show of congressional involvement.</p>
<p>Supposedly, there are many laws both national and international, involving war.  Many of them were made a big deal of during the show that was the Iraq war.  They don&rsquo;t seem to exist for the attack on Kadafi.</p>
<p>Anyway.  Immigrants are not a threat to our voting power.</p>
<p>We have none.</p>

		<p>Again, I will tell as many whites as will listen&hellip;</p>
<p>Socialism/Communism is being promoted by the elites because it facilitates the ushering in of global government.  They want global government to control everyone - and own everything!  They are not free enterprise capitalists.  They are monopolistic capitalists!  Go ahead reevaluate history with this in mind.  A lightbulb will go on!</p>
<p>Whites are basically the dominant supporters of liberty which goes against the agenda hence the promotion of diversity/multiculturalism/non-whites.  To divide and conquer is the endgame and we&rsquo;re fast approaching it!<br>

		<p>The American government is dissolving the people and electing a new one. Great for the Democrats but terrible for the Republicans. So why don&rsquo;t the latter vigourously oppose it?</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the Labour party has used colored immigration to reshape the electorate to its own advantage and against the Conservatives. But the Tories say nothing about it.</p>
<p>In Canada the Liberal party has been replacing the Canadian people with third world non-whites since 1967, but the brain-dead Conservatives do nothing and ignore the matter.</p>
<p>All three parties have been &#8220;GRAMSCIZED&#8221;. They have accepted an ideology of egalitarianism and political correctness that will lead them, lemming-like, to their disaster. </p>
<p>BTW&hellip; Antonio Gramsci was a marxist who argued that the key to power was to control discussion in such a manner as to have your views alone accepted as &#8220;appropriate&#8221;. This forces all other groups to adhere to YOUR agenda.</p>

		<p>Demographic change-race-replacement-means an ever dwindling Native Born White American Minority putting its fate in the hands of a highly armed and hostile post-1965 high fertility nonwhite majority. And if you have any uncertainty about what this means it goes something like this:the Native Born White  American Minority will be  violently persecuted the moment they complain about and resist racial discrimination.</p>
<p>What the Democratic Party is doing should be seen for what  it is:a war of racial aggresion against the current Native Born White Majority of America. Since Native Born White Americans won&rsquo;t vote Democratic, the Democratic made the policy decision to import its voters from India,China,Pakistan,Korea,Mexico,Nigeria,Jamaica and many other nonwhite nations with the intent of creating a majority nonwhite voting block that will vote enthusiascally for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;.street by street,town by town,county by county and state by state. So, it is obviously treason&hellip;.but, on a much more fundamental level, it is a calculated and well financed race war against the Native Born White American Majority. Native Born White Americans are being rapidly stripped-with each passing day-of the fundamental right to determine their own fate. </p>

		<p>Social Democracy only works in countries where nearly everyone is white. The American working class never developed a socialist consciousness because it is heterogeneous. The influx of Hispanics will increase the heterogeneity of the American working class, cause more whites to vote Republican and increase the power of the investor - employer class. <br>
 <br>
The influx of Hispanics will also increase the wealth of the investor - employer class by deflating wages, inflating prices, and raising profits.  </p>

		<p>I think most of us figured this out many years ago!  Even an imbecile could figure that out.</p>
<p>Racial demograhics, of course spells a Democrat future! 95% of all nonwhites will vote for a lefty &#8220;person of color&#8221; every time. Right now they vote for the White man&rsquo;s money when a White lefty politician agrees to give it to them.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s an ugly situation but even more of a reason for WNs to court the 20% of right-voting immigrant progeny via the TP &amp; GOP while making it clear that the values they vote for are White, that Whites are big brothers to non-White rightists and their best guarantors of being taken over by the Multicultural Left.</p>

 There were some remarkably round numbers in the 2008<br>
election. McCain won by 10 million among whites, but<br>
lost by 20 million among non-whites.<br>
 <br>
 The 2010 elections showed a much higher percentage of white<br>
votes for Republicans (about 63% versus 56% in &#8216;08). If they<br>
can continue that, they can still win some more elections.<br>
If not, it will be another deluge.</p>

		<p>In an interesting coincidence, we&rsquo;re having a national election in Canada. It was pretty boring with little chance of much change until last week when opinion polls picked up a growing shift toward our socialist NDP party. It doesn&rsquo;t look like it will get power, it looks like the conservatives will lead the next government, but the socialists are taking a lot of support away from the liberal party and the separatist party in Quebec. We&rsquo;ll have to see after next Monday&rsquo;s vote but now it looks like the socialists will move up from a 4th place nuisance party to the powerful second place party. </p>

<p><br>
One can only marvel at the exceptional success the federal government has enjoyed in its efforts to reduce whites to minority status. The government&rsquo;s achievement is clearest in states like Texas and California.  These big border states are harbingers:   </p>
<p>&#8220;Looking at population projections for Texas, demographer Steve Murdock concludes: &#8216;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos.&rsquo;   </p>
<p>&#8220;Two of every three Texas children are now non-Anglo and the trend line will become even more pronounced in the future, said Murdock, former U.S. Census Bureau director &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s &#8220;over for Anglos&#8221; in California to:</p>
<p>&#8220;Coastal California &hellip; has had a vast inflow of immigrants and a similarly vast outflow of Americans &hellip; Metro Los Angeles and San Francisco increasingly resemble Mexico City and São Paulo, with a large affluent upper class, a vast proletariat, and a huge income gap in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>COMMENT: The federal government is not the only stalwart in this nation-destroying project. Print and broadcast journalists have never wavered in the cause of white displacement.   </p>

<p>The welfare state will slowly just decay away? The money to pay for it will be missing, NOT even available. Even if all those persons [new voters] want the welfare state [not really socialist, welfare state a better description], the money to pay for it is not there.</p>

A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious.But it cannot survive treason from within.<br>
An enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and he carries his banner openly.<br>
But the traitor moves among those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears no traitor; he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their garments, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men.<br>
He rots the soul of a nation; he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city; he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist.<br>
A murderer is less to be feared. ~ Cicero</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to make this point before and I&rsquo;ll do the same now: Just as the Baby Boomer generation that I am a part of was brainwashed into buying into the Counter-Culture Hippie and Civil Rights Movements of the 1960&rsquo;s, and once it was captured ideologically for the most part it was &#8220;game over&#8221; as far as the direction of U.S. society, so too the newest generation of European-Americans are soon going to wake up to a new Counter-Culture Movement which is going to allow them to restore the racial consciousness and pride in one&rsquo;s past which was obliterated by my generation&rsquo;s foolishness.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the cultural and political indoctrination in the schools and greater society is not continuing apace, since it is in full swing as we well know. But as young people of European descent in this country come to see themselves realistically as simply another minority in a nation of minorities, albeit the largest one for the moment, a sort of racial dialectic will come into play that will give rise to significant changes in their mind set.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t make sense any more for them to be the &#8220;gracious liberals&#8221; and the guilt-ridden whites of society, as older whites have been trained to be. As a result of this, &#8220;the scales will be falling from their eyes&#8221; and they will &#8220;tune in&#8221; to the kind of thinking that most of those who post at this web site have developed. At that point political events that we probably can&rsquo;t imagine will begin to occur which may finally lead to issues of real self-interest for whites in this country being addressed.</p>

		<p>Well, there is one thing wrong with these predictions: They don&rsquo;t take into account how much the non-whites depend on us. They need welfare, affirmative action and jobs to survive.</p>
<p>When the economy will really crash (just a few more years, tops) whites will no longer be able to afford supposedly &#8220;cheap&#8221; 3rd-world servants and will be forced to do it themselves. The taxes are already at their &#8220;optimum&#8221;, any further rises will cause lower tax returns because of avoidance and refusal to work.</p>
<p>What will the 3rd-worlders do then? In depression-conditions their children will starve just like their cousins in Africa which are now about half-dependent on food aid.</p>
<p>Malthus is coming back and will restore the natural order of things. Without cheap oil the world will be a lot more darwinian than it is now.</p>

		<p>We have seen many such predictions of demographic change, mostly based on low white birthrates and unrestricted immigration, and they may be correct as far as they go, but they always leave out the real determining factor&hellip;.</p>
<p>IF WE DO NOTHING!</p>
<p>Personally, I would not believe that the whites I am related to would go quietly into the night, nor would they sit still while they were being replaced by foreign pestilence. Either the white Americans will move quickly to usher the illegals back to (where ever) or they will be defeated and destroyed. This story is not going to end with a whimper.</p>

Your view of the situation is exactly the same as mine. There are in fact  limits to growth&hellip;all growth comes to an end.  Even before we reach the ultimate Malthusian limits, &#8220;American&#8221; society will become unbearable for millions of White Americans&hellip;no matter what region of the nation they live in&hellip; it&rsquo;s going to be a drought stricken future&hellip;food scarcities&hellip;economic collapse&hellip;violent racial conflict&hellip;all this before Malthusiasn ecological collapse&hellip;all of this could happen&hellip;the Perfect Storm&hellip; this summer. The only game in town is to encourage the Hindus and other high fertility post-1965 nonwhites to leave our America..we came close to doing this the month after 9/11&hellip;Native Born White Americans were in very nasty mood that month&hellip;very nasty.</p>

		<p>There will continue to be a massive, increased flood of Mexicans pushing their way into the US to escape the escalating violence and mayhem of Mexico&rsquo;s Civil Wars.</p>
<p>The US State Department has issued a travel warning for Mexico:</p>
<p><i>Travel Warnings are issued to describe long-term, protracted conditions that make a country dangerous or unstable.</i></p>
<p>Here are parts of the warning from the US State Department:</p>
<p><i>According to Government of Mexico figures, 34,612 people have been killed in violence in Mexico since December 2006. More than 15,000 narcotics-related homicides occurred in 2010, an increase of almost two-thirds compared to 2009.</i></p>
<p><i>Criminal organizations have erected their own unauthorized checkpoints, and killed or abducted motorists who have failed to stop at them.</i></p>
<p><i>Since 2006, large firefights have taken place in towns and cities in many parts of Mexico, often in broad daylight on streets and other public venues.</i></p>
<p><i>In recent months, criminal organizations have used stolen trucks to block major highways and thus prevent the military from responding to criminal activity</i></p>
<p>And Mexico&rsquo;s Civil War is escalating as the government cracks down on the cartels   &mdash;     cartels armed with military weaponry such as rocket launchers, automatic weapons, grenades, grenade launchers and machine guns (NOT purchased in US gun stores or at gun shows as the Mexican government tells us)</p>
<p>Mexico faces years of instability, civil war and most importantly for the US, overwhelming waves of poor, uneducated refugees pouring across the US border, demanding services and changing US demographics.</p>
<p>With no end in sight.</p>

		<p>Looking over all these stats- which as was posted earlier- would be self - evident to any MORON, is like:</p>
<p>&#8221; Hmm, let me see, we&rsquo;re dead. So, I look at the numbers, and their inevitable results, and&hellip;we&rsquo;re dead. These numbers were clearly indicated a decade ago, when the projections stated&hellip;we&rsquo;re dead. <br>
My grandmother said we&rsquo;d grow old in a black world almost a century ago!</p>
<p>Seems even then, people knew&hellip;we&rsquo;re DEAD.<br>
Unless severe intervention occurs.<br>
 It&rsquo;s the only thing that will move the slumbering white masses now&hellip;true disaster, and the collapse of the Lamestream media&rsquo;s ability to rub shineola over the bestiality of the third world&rsquo;s spawn in our midst. And of course, in the strife of civil war, no one&rsquo;s going to cling to political correctness &hellip;there will be no jobs to grovel for, and the cultural high priests won&rsquo;t have any goodies to offer us, or valid threats to level against us. Likely they&rsquo;ll be hiding in a hole in the ground, cringing, peeing their pants.<br>
Then, and only then, might whites rise up and throw out the third worlders en masse, expel the traitors, and start again. <br>
I abhore the thought, but I also abhore this lingering death&hellip;</p>

NO. It has been there from the start, and whites have drifted farther from eachother with the centuries.

		<p>Third World Immigration does not mean socialism.  Socialism as practiced in the West is possible only so long as the people working productive jobs and paying taxes outnumber the people on welfare-type programs or in government-run make-work jobs (no, &#8220;welfare case manager&#8221; or &#8220;diversity coordinator&#8221; is not productive work; their is no net economic gain from these activities).  </p>
<p>Once this is no longer the case and the middle class outnumbered, socialism itself must collapse.  The Malthusian future rdc75 mentioned above (19) is absolutely correct.  For a good idea of what sort of future awaits the US and Western Europe, look at India or Brazil.</p>

<p>In South Africa they are being kept alive by welfare. The gamble is who will last longer - the poor blacks on welfare, or the shrinking white population.</p>
<p>Before the blacks starve, it might come to this scenario (starving whites), and is that not already partly true in the USA, but the numbers can steeply increase:</p>
<p><a href="https://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/2010/11/whites-not-allowed-in-kagiso-township.html" rel="nofollow">https://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/2010/11/whites-not-allowed-in-kagiso-township.html</a></p>
<p>So I would not only rely on this one single factor. Over here there were a lot of people who relied on the single factor AIDS, but so far it has not made a dent in the figures, it only slowed down the increase in population.</p>
<p>One has to attack the principal cause behind all this, not only the symptoms. The foreign invasion and non-white population increase is a symptom. One has to eradicate the cause behind this.</p>
<p>Otherwise the cause will protect the symptoms, end the symptom will just carry on. This is what is happening in our country, for few dare speak out what the real symptoms are. The blacks are the immediate threat but in reality they themselves are just the puppets on a string. </p>

		<p>Bill Clinton and other White Democrats are always cheering for the day when Whites become a minority in the next couple of decades.  I&rsquo;m wondering if there&rsquo;s any game plan in place for people like them to maintain any semblance of power in the party when they are outnumbered by minorities?  Let&rsquo;s see, about 25 percent of the electorate is nonwhite and about 20 percent vote Democrat.  That means nonwhites right now make up about 40 percent of the Democrat Party right now.  We could be looking at two or three more election cycles, depending on the level of White flight from the DNC, before they take over the party.  What happens when they take over fundraising, the DNC Chairmanship and all the other levers of power just by sheer numbers and push the White liberals to the back of the bus?  I would say it will have a significant effect on the militant feminist and homosexual agendas in the party.  Despite the &#8220;diversity is our strength&#8221; rhetoric, these people are sweating bullets under their game faces.  They will either step back and allow conservatives to handle the immigration mess and they&rsquo;ll provide just enough nominal support to get the ball rolling. Or the conservatives may just sit on their hands and force an explosive situation where the Democrat leadership will have to deal with it much to the anger of their latino constituents.    </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Well, there is one thing wrong with these predictions: They don&rsquo;t take into account how much the non-whites depend on us. They need welfare, affirmative action and jobs to survive.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>As we need fuel and grocery store and water and power deliveries and a viable economy to practice our specialty skillsets.  If things get really, really, bad; you can count on a WPA attitude towards ALL of us.  Do what we say, for as long as we say, in whatever mixed groups we say.  Or we won&rsquo;t feed you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
When the economy will really crash (just a few more years, tops) whites will no longer be able to afford supposedly &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; 3rd-world servants and will be forced to do it themselves. The taxes are already at their &ldquo;optimum&rdquo;, any further rises will cause lower tax returns because of avoidance and refusal to work.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When the economy crashed in Germany, a stack of mark notes taller than a boy and his sister _would not_ pay for a single loaf of bread.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
What will the 3rd-worlders do then? In depression-conditions their children will starve just like their cousins in Africa which are now about half-dependent on food aid.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>What they will do then will be Rwanda style warfare with a lot more ethnic cohesion than we practice and a tendency to criming violence that could be considered &#8216;wargames practice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to see a continent of 300 million go to war on itself.  Blood and Tears sir.  Blood and Tears.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Malthus is coming back and will restore the natural order of things. Without cheap oil the world will be a lot more darwinian than it is now.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Malthus saw that the rich tried to overproduce a system, growing a population from which ever greater profits could accrue.  He then forecast a -series- of dieoffs in which the apparency of &#8216;bad times gone away, good times come to stay&hellip;&rsquo; allowed the system to once again reload itself for -another- terrifying destructive cycle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
We have seen many such predictions of demographic change, mostly based on low white birthrates and unrestricted immigration, and they may be correct as far as they go, but they always leave out the real determining factor&hellip;.</p>
<p>IF WE DO NOTHING!<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &#8216;what is the something we should be doing&rsquo; element that matters here sir.  If you won&rsquo;t wage ethnic cleansing operations, you cannot &#8216;solve&rsquo; America&rsquo;s problems.  And when I say that I am talking about 37 million blacks and probably at least 50 million hispanics of all flavors.  WWII never saw that many people flung at each other with a &#8216;win or lose the ability to fight&rsquo; mindset of fighting for every gasoline station with full pumps so that you could drive to the next community.</p>
<p>OTOH, if we do things properly, it is possible for whites to occupy a middle ground, likely -after- Hispanics have declared California and the Southwest as their own territories.  Because that middle ground includes the nuclear reservations of Montana and Missouri and North Dakota.</p>
<p>It will be hard and there will be enormous slaughter but the combination of certain natural obstacles and a condensed white super majority who will -have to- fight on the borders in pell mell fashion will give us a chance.</p>
<p>And if we can survive six months, whatever residual, national, establishment remains will be able to assert authority (Strategic Petroleum Reserves and most of the refineries) and we can begin to make some negotiable decisions.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Personally, I would not believe that the whites I am related to would go quietly into the night, nor would they sit still while they were being replaced by foreign pestilence. Either the white Americans will move quickly to usher the illegals back to (where ever) or they will be defeated and destroyed. This story is not going to end with a whimper.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Quietly or screaming, you will find that a war between 300 million people who suddenly find they can&rsquo;t buy anything with paper money and can&rsquo;t trade &#8216;professional skills&rsquo; against ghetto/street wise understandings puts whites at a savage disadvantage.  Bluntly, because we are peaceable bordering on pacifistic, we will die the most.  The question is: will there be enough of us left, after those 2-6 months, to let us pick up the pieces before the ROW steps up to decide for us through globalistic agendas?</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t develop plans to relocate key people, industries, academia and industry/infrastructure, even as a WSM center state in a nation ruled in the east by blacks and remnant USA nationalism, and in the west and south by hispanics, we will NOT have anything to offer to or against whatever &#8216;coalition&rsquo; comes to feast on the remains of our lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the aftermath that I am most worried about.</p>

		<p>Non-whites (all of them) vote overwhelmingly democrat because they have always considered the republicans as the party of white people. By voting democrat they feel this is a way of keeping the white people under control. If not, they think we will &#8220;oppress&#8221; them in some way. Even highly educated Asians, Indians and others who have done well under our system think this way. Odd as it may seem. </p>

And they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be non-white.  That&rsquo;s what put them  in the White House. Even his daughter has married into the dominant  minority. The self-seeker Clinton  betrayed us and left his own kind long ago.</p>

The middle class in the United States is threatened and declining because for at least a generation the people who own and run this country have been exporting good jobs and importing cheap labor. Both political parties have been complicit in this. Nevertheless, the threat is not caused by socialism, but by plutocracy.  </p>

		<p>39:  You mean Chelsea Clinton marrying Marc Mezvinsky?  I was always suspicious about that marriage, because the only man who would want to marry Ugly Betty is one that is blind.  Obviously, he can see, so there had to be something else wrong with him.  As it turned out, he quit his &#8220;investment banker&#8221; job not long after the last slice of wedding cake was consumed, in order to become a Colorado ski bum.  It got so bad that the grapevine said that Hillary and Chelsea were looking for a legal maneuver to annul the marriage.</p>
<p>So the answer was he wanted to marry Bill and Hillary&rsquo;s bank account so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to work for a living.  In a job that his one-term Congresswoman aunt got for him, essentially.  Sure, some &#8220;investment banker.&#8221;</p>
