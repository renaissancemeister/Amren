<h1><a href="http://www.english.rfi.fr/europe/20110417-france-cancels-trains-italy-stop-immigration-protest">France Cancels Migrant Trains from Italy</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Radio France Internationale (RFI), April 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy has lodged a complaint with the French government after France cancelled cross-border train services on Sunday to prevent a planned protest against immigration controls. Human rights activists blocked the Italian station of Ventimiglia instead.</p>
<p>French, Italian and Tunisian protesters had planned to board what they called a &#8220;train of dignity&#8221; in Ventimiglia and travel to Nice in southern France, in defiance of the limits on immigration introduced in the wake of recent upheaval in North Africa.</p>
<p>The demonstrators want to &#8220;open borders, guarantee free access to European territory, and remind people that no human being is &#8216;illegal&rsquo;&#8221;, according to organisers.</p>
<p>But all mainline train services from Italy to France were cancelled on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Activists said they would sleep at the station and attempt to board a train on Monday.</p>
<p>Rome has asked for clarification on France&rsquo;s decision to block the services, which &#8220;appear to be illegal and in clear violation of European principles&#8221;, according to Foreign Minister Franco Frattini.</p>
<p>The French government has objected to Italy&rsquo;s recent decision to grant temporary visas to thousands of migrants from Tunisia, saying that it doesn&rsquo;t want an influx of migrants arriving in France.<br>

<p>And when they find that excuse, don&rsquo;t expect the elitists in Europe to return them to their shores, because they&rsquo;re so cowardly they&rsquo;re afraid of being called &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If the Italians, French or Spanish are too nice to simply sink the invaders ships then the next option is simple.  Place them all in detention camps with minimal comforts.  Take finger prints and DNA samples, tell them that they will be executed if they ever return for any reason and send them back.  And mean it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother looking out for asylees, stop granting anyone asylum for any reason.  Let them clean up their own houses for a change.  And if the European Union doesn&rsquo;t like it what can they do?  Invade Italy?  Throw them out of the EU?  They can&rsquo;t throw out France, it is too big a percentage of the EU.  The EU is actually pretty darn powerless without the voluntary cooperation of the participating countries.  Unlike the US &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; what are the chances of white German, Dutch or Austrian troops shooting Italians or Frenchmen or Spaniards?  </p>
<p>The greatest fear of the EU elite would be that a show of EU force against a member state would start the whole ball unraveling.  Bombing Berlusconi is a little different than bombing Khadafy.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s great to know that France (and appearantly Finland and hopefully more countries in Europe) are waking up what enforced multiculturalism is really about - the displacement of whites who are native to Europe.</p>
<p>The question is will the USA ever follow this kind of example or is it too late?</p>

<p>Yes, indeed!   We have all of that tired rubbish before.  Which is PROOF that this movement is internationally organized. Whether they&rsquo;re promoting Tunisian invaders in France or Mexicans in the US, they are all part of the same gang. They are the enemies of western civilization.</p>

		<p>I wish these French politicians would engage in the intellectual debate about this problem. Ideas matter. Get into arguments and challenge people to debate. Bring forward good thinkers to public attention. Push the civil service to develop rhetoric that supports immigration restriction. Build a coalition of leaders from other countries and join forces. If the French polticians are serious about the problem I don&rsquo;t see how they can avoid the battle over ideas. </p>

		<p>The analogy is with a cargo of toxic, radioactive waste that no national government will allow to come on to its shores because they fully understand the hazardous nature of the waste.<br>
   This just shows the hypocrisy, mendacity and duplicity of the political classes that rule the west.On the one hand, at one level, at least, they internalize the dangerous and destructive nature of mass third world immigration.On the other hand, the elites are still quitely pushing for open borders - but they cannot stand being caught out in the open in a spectacular fashion.<br>
 They are nothing but a nest of snakes.</p>

		<p>The train or two being stopped by the French sounds good but is it the real deal? Sarkozy, the crafty diminutive leader of French politics, is making the most of this charade trying to dupe the people with his phoney but essentially ineffective activities. Fact is France is teeming with hordes of invaders from Africa and they don&rsquo;t just come by train.</p>
<p>The deceptive Sarkozy and his gang did nothing until his political fortunes took a freefall. France and Europe are lost without substantial demographic changes back to making Europe home of Europeans and not opened to settlement by insane politics by which multitudes of Africans looking for a change for the better are ushered in by corrupt elites. <br>

		<p>@12 White Advocate,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Push the civil service to develop rhetoric that supports immigration restriction. Build a coalition of leaders from other countries and join forces. If the French polticians are serious about the problem I don&rsquo;t see how they can avoid the battle over ideas. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s some rhetoric:</p>
<p>1.  Decouple the notion of national survival from capitalism.  If a nation cannot survive as a people by capitalist means, then what good the system which no longer serves their needs?</p>
<p>2.  It would cost less to bring the West to Africa or Asia than the other way around.  We spent trillions through three major wars (the Cold War the most expensive of all) and are now halfway through our second trillion &#8216;saving SWA&rsquo; from a terrorist phantom menace.  You want to show the profit of mass production in a &#8216;war for society&rsquo;?  10 million air conditioners for Libya please.  And ECCA?  Wire up the Mediterranean, it&rsquo;s on the EU&rsquo;s account.  One time investments in cultural uplift, even for countries whose populations are beyond being able to pay for it, would help make the European Invasion Alternative less palateable.  You could threaten to sink boats if their was no reason but greed for migration.  You could require population controls after the first or second child if it came with a 100,000 dollar aid package for each family that bought into the system.  Think I&rsquo;m exaggerating?  It takes 40,000 dollars to train a soldier.  Every American has a 100,00 dollar head bounty as &#8216;life insurance&rsquo;.  Do the math on a 1:3 ratio of payout.</p>
<p>3.  Robots All Round.<br>
If you look at history, man&rsquo;s peaks and valleys are defined by what he could enslave.  Civilization is built on exploiting what is _free_ to the point where it no longer can support the existing system.  Ice Age?  Walk South To Sunlight.  Isolation and Starvation in drout?  Seawater and a Coastal Highway to better places, faster.  Insufficient labor or calorie reserves?  Domesticate Animals and walk your meat with you.  Carrying a pack.  No technology or territory sufficient to ensure a reliable source of food in a world where populations are growing and open spaces becoming smaller?  Irrigation from flood and drinking water from windmill driven wells.  Can&rsquo;t keep track of all your lands and activities while planning new ones?  Declare war and enslave the skilled POWs.</p>
<p>Robots are the next step in that evolution.  Because unlike steam or industrialization, they don&rsquo;t require MORE population, to feed the ravenous hunger of manufacturing for added labor and suffering, they actually replace it.</p>
<p>One robot that is paid nothing can probably feed five people who _know nothing_ (sub-Saharan 70 IQ), because it can work 24:7:365 and can download skillsets in everything from housepainting to road maintenance to diaper changing to picking fruit.  And yet for all these skills, it will never be sentient so much as &#8216;expert&rsquo; in a way which dictates how few rights it must be given.</p>
<p>Hitler sent half his labor force home with a bonus to become mothers.  He used strict economic controls to keep wages down and food prices level, even though there was a real shortage of the latter.  He paid for massive infrastructure economic programs.  And he rebuilt the German military from scratch while importing 26 of 34 essential minerals necessary to make his wartime industry work.  In the process of _paying for_ this &#8216;economic miracle&rsquo;, he Quantitavely Eased the Reichsmark to the point where Germany had virtually no gold reserves left and the two largest German banks were writing each other loan guarantees for money that was not in the market system.</p>
<p>Basically, he bankrupted Germany and had he not gone to war in 1939, would have been thrown out on his ear in 1940-41 as massive inflation took hold once more.</p>
<p>The echoes of that mistake, in our present situation, are eery.</p>
<p>Had Hitler had robots, he could have paid his population to sit on their behinds and make little Germans while achieving twice the productivity with NO SLAVE IMPRISONMENT OF JEWISH LABOR.</p>
<p>And WWII would likely not have happened.</p>
<p>The question is: do we want to avoid a major race war inside our borders as a means to isolate us from world events and enable a globalist takeover?  Or do we want to help the third world while ridding ourselves of the racial disharmony that has been thrust unwillingly and indeed _unwittingly_ upon us?</p>
<p>In recognizing the cast seeds of the problem, lies the flower of a beautiful solution.</p>
<p>Labor is the reason these poor fools are being wage-slave imported.  Inability to pay for a decent life in their own country is the reason they agree to become second class citizens in our world.  Split the difference.  Send them home with robots to diligently build up their lands.  Give them commercial goods credits to keep our factories working.  And pay for those goods with robot surplus salaries that the machines don&rsquo;t use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

		<p>#17, I have thought of several of those elements in the past, but I never thought of putting them together as you have. Nor did I explain them so well. I&rsquo;ll come back to study your post over the next several days. It is a big project, you have to admit, so it won&rsquo;t get implemented in one shot. It&rsquo;ll be staged over years and wander away from initial planning. I always seem to think white identity plays a big role. So I&rsquo;m always thinking of ways to get regular folks participating more in our movement. I&rsquo;m sure there are lots of smart whites who would love to tackle the big plan, but are pushed away from thinking white. </p>
