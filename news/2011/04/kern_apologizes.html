			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael McNutt, NewsOK (Oklahoma City), April 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;I want to humbly apologize for my statements last night about African-Americans and women,&#8221; Kern, R-Oklahoma City, said in a statement. &#8220;I believe that our government should not provide preference based on race or gender. I misspoke while trying to convey this point last night during debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>House Speaker Kris Steele, R-Shawnee, said he called Kern to express his concerns, but he will not ask her to step down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her I disagree with her comments,&#8221; Steele said. &#8220;She&rsquo;s done the right thing in issuing that apology.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do think the apology is sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Douglas, president of the Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP, said the apology is not enough. </p>
<p>He said Kern should resign immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot commit racism and then offer an apology for the racist statement that you make,&#8221; Douglas said. &#8220;The citizens of Oklahoma, the constituents can no longer stand by and allow this type of action to happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her constituents in her district should call for her to step down unless .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they support her in what she&rsquo;s saying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;ll continue to call for her to step down.&#8221;</p>
<p>What did she say?</p>
<p>During a debate Wednesday night on the House of Representatives floor, Kern said minorities earn less than white people and women earn less than men because they don&rsquo;t work as hard and have less initiative. She made the comments while debating for Senate Joint Resolution 15, a ballot measure that would allow the state to not abide by affirmative action guidelines.</p>
<p>SJR 15 would ask people to vote on barring discrimination by state agencies. It would prohibit any official action that discriminates against or gives preferential treatment to minority communities. Set-asides, which favor contract bids made by firms owned by minorities, would be illegal under the proposal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kern, who drew fire three years ago when she told an Oklahoma City Republican group that the homosexual agenda is a bigger threat than terrorism or Islam to America, said equal opportunity should be based on ability regardless of color and gender.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about personal initiative? What about personal drive? What about hard work?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Doesn&rsquo;t that enter in somewhere?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s character that ought to count,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kern said she didn&rsquo;t worry about equal pay during her career. She said some studies show women are underpaid, but when actual hours worked and work hazards are factored in, women earn more than men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women usually don&rsquo;t want to work as hard as a man,&#8221; Kern said. &#8220;Women tend to think a little bit more about their family, wanting to be at home more time, wanting to have a little more leisure time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not saying women don&rsquo;t work hard,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Women like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to have a moderate work life with plenty of time for spouse and children and other things like that. They work very hard, but sometimes they aren&rsquo;t willing to commit their whole life to their job like a lot of men do.&#8221;</p>

						<p>
							<i>Randy Krehbiel, Tulsa World, April 27, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>The Oklahoma House of Representatives has approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would eliminate affirmative action in state government.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment passed by a vote of 59-14 Wednesday evening, with 28 members absent or not voting. It had already passed the Senate and will go to a vote of the people next year.</p>
<p>House Joint Resolution was presented by Rep. T.W. Shannon, R-Lawton, in the absence of House author Leslie Osborn, R-Tuttle. Shannon, a man of African and Chickasaw heritage who is angling to become the state&rsquo;s first black speaker of the House, said he believes that Affirmative Action has failed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Sally Kern, R-Oklahoma City, said minorities earn less than white people because they don&rsquo;t work as hard and have less initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a high percentage of blacks in prison, and that&rsquo;s tragic, but are they in prison just because they are black or because they don&rsquo;t want to study as hard in school? I&rsquo;ve taught school, and I saw a lot of people of color who didn&rsquo;t study hard because they said the government would take care of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He should have said, &#8220;Okay, you want my apology.  What&rsquo;s your offer?  When you tell me that you will do more to advance your people beyond indolence and criminality, then I&rsquo;ll look at your evidence and consider apologizing, but only as an equitable exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>What most disgusts us about Whites is our own lack of ability to demand negotiations when our enemies are making demands on our virtue.</p>
<p>We failed. All the horror to come are our own fault.</p>
<p>We are long overdue for a reframing of our responses to the race racket.    We must begin to put our small indiscretions in context of their large failures of living up to the promise of equality. </p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we count on our leaders to think of that for themselves? Why does the best idea of post-racial America show up only in the comments of a race realist blog?  We&rsquo;ve lost our will to demand more from our leaders.<br>

		<p>Liking Sally Kern, here. To my knowledge, and contrary to leftist doctrine, the first amendment hasn&rsquo;t been rescinded, so far.<br>
What she has stated, I have personally witnessed, and if I have, so have others. Stating as fact what you know to be true is not racism.<br>
Could that be the reason naacp wants to silence her?<br>
Or are they just holding out for the cash settlement?</p>

		<p>Another &#8220;conservative&#8221; politician who apologizes for telling the truth on race and (apparently) wants to distract us from real threats such as Islamification with irrational paranoia over homosexuals.  If being anti-gay is your main issue, then your main source of support in the U.S.   &mdash;   the most anti-gay demographic   &mdash;   is blacks.  Your main allies around the world   &mdash;   the places where homosexuality is treated as a threat to society and made illegal   &mdash;   include Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Sudan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan, Guyana.</p>

<p>Another condemned for speaker the truth.  Had this been a white man, the NAACP and ACLU would have tried to get Holder to file charges against him.</p>
<p>I would have fired back with a question to the NAACP and said, &#8220;One thing I could think of that is more racist than what I said would be an organization that looks out for only one ethnicity or race and no one else.  Know any?&#8221;</p>
<p>And before anyone gets on my case, some minorities and some females do work hard, I know.  But I would find it hard to believe they work as hard as white men.  We aren&rsquo;t a protected class, so we have to work harder.</p>

<p>False.</p>
<p>The Society of Blacks in Higher Education demonstrates that, when indexed for intellect as reflected by SAT scores, a Logical metric in an &lsquo;information economy&rsquo;, those blacks who show up to the office on a regular enough basis to not be fired are paid 500% of their white counterparts. Third article down on the right. Birthright privilege is not with the whites as can be clearly observed by anyone who has worked in the real world.</p>

		<p>COMMIT racism???  Is that like committing - a crime??  I think not.  One cannot be punished for one&rsquo;s deepest-held beliefs, nor should anyone be punished for expressing them.  This insane liberal demand that NOBODY ever get their feelings hurt, or experience unfairness, or have a sore rear end from the whuppin&rsquo; you got for putting a frog in an old lady&rsquo;s pocket   &mdash;   has made this country incredibly weak.  Today&rsquo;s people, 40 and under, have never known what real prejudice is, what real hardship is, what real pain is about, unless they have had a fatal disease and conquered it.  Today&rsquo;s kids have had everything provided for them and have been shielded from life&rsquo;s blows.  All too soon we are going to pay a terrible price for it, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to the idiots who prattle their liberal views wherever they can.</p>

Women prefer successful men. Men do not prefer successful women. This gives men a powerful motive to succeed that women do not have. <br>
 <br>
Whites tend to earn more than blacks because by every objective, measurable criteria they tend to be more capable. <br>

		<p>You are wrong about that.  Homosexuality is another threat the West just like immigration.  Just because the media organs control in the West are pro-homosexual doesn&rsquo;t mean the majority of people are.  It creates an unstable society where family life comes under assault and morality becomes an antiquated concept. People see the world crashing down around them and they wonder whether they should be bringing children into a world where anything goes.  No one is stopping homosexuals from having sex and if they want to get married they can go to the Metropolitan Community Church and have a ceremony performed if it makes them feel better but don&rsquo;t expect people to vote to publicly sanction these things.  No one&rsquo;s rights are being trampled here what you&rsquo;re talking about it is special privileges. There is a line between having personal freedom and doing whatever you want.  </p>

		<p>Regardless if sincere or not, NEVER, EVER apologize to blacks when regarding ones statements. It will not earn you forgiveness and will be perceived as a sign of weakness. An apology to a black is nothing less than blood in the water, inviting even more attack. Be true to yourself and stand your ground.</p>

		<p>List and discuss racist organizations; like La Raza, NAACP, NBPP, just keep going.  List the members of Congress who have websites with &#8220;anything&#8221; listed for helping white people.</p>
<p>These organizations are strictly racist, and for one race of people only.  Many members of Congress list only programs and proposed legislation for minorities only.  Where do the whites fit in this matrix?  Paying for and then going away.  Away being prominent.</p>
<p>Stop apologizing, stand up and state the truth.  Busing has ruined schools, cities, neighborhoods, and peoples lives.  Our nation.</p>
<p>Diversity isn&rsquo;t strength, forced diversity by law rather than achievement is a failed practice.  We get weaker everyday.</p>
<p>Stop apologizing and stop waiting for equality, live it, demand it, and stop patronizing the liars in charge and in sports.  </p>

		<p>NEVER apologize. Never. I know this goes against our cultural norm. Minorities see this like blood in the water and it never stops. If you absolutely must apoligize then preface it by saying you will do it once and never again address the issue. But better to stand your ground. No grovel, no story. They&rsquo;ll move on to the easy victims. Just reiterate your point.</p>

<p>Truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>My whole life experience has shown me that with few exceptions the majority of blacks not only shun learning, education, and industry but in many cases have an absolute disdain if not contempt for these things.   </p>
<p>Initiative and self improvement are mostly alien concepts to a great many blacks, probably most. Hustling and what they call &#8220;running my game&#8221; are the principles by which they live, the credo which gives purose to their lives. Deceit, duplicity, subertfuge, crime, etc. are all acceptable.  To get what you don&rsquo;t deserve by any means fair or foul is the grand strategy. </p>
<p>Invisible to my eyes for the most part is the guest for a life based on honor, magnanimity, character, industry.  Indeed, these things are derided by blacks as chacteristics of the weak and foolish.  Blacks who do strive for these things are held in contmept for &#8220;acting white.&#8221; </p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.  Certainly sloth and deceit are traits present in all ethnicities and races.  But never have I witnessed these traits to the same degree as I have with black Africans.  Not by a long shot.</p>
<p>This woman&rsquo;s only crime is saying what everyone knows.</p>

<p>Ditto, here. It is part of the controlled opposition, like Donald Trump and the Republican Party is a part of, to make us White folks even more afraid to voice our true feelings on race and our survival. After all, why say it when we just have to &#8220;apologize&#8221; and then be demonized and ostracized in the process, especially by our own and the Republicans, who distance themselves from us &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>

<p>Like Gran&rsquo; Feliz Pedote at 9:31 PM, what struck me most about this story was this statement. Notice the ramping up of the rhetoric here? &#8220;Racism&#8221; is no longer just the stating of an opinion, it&rsquo;s something that you &#8220;commit,&#8221; like a crime. Actually, it is exactly that, a thought crime.</p>

<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t.  There were homosexuals in ancient Greece, probably just as many as there are today.  There will be about the same number (proportionally) 50, 100, 200+ years from now.  There is no growing threat from homosexuality.  </p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t pass on their genes.  They come from heterosexual parents!  </p>
<p>Moreover, culture and upbringing has virtually nothing to do with whether a person will turn out homosexual.  It&rsquo;s almost entirely genetic (that&rsquo;s why you can often identify gay/lesbian people just from their physical appearance).  Anyone who is a race realist should be a realist with regard to sexuality, too.</p>

What, really?? Even if the U.S went back to being white and Christian, a certain percentage of babies born would be homosexual. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are genetically predetermined. It&rsquo;s not a choice, but it is hard-wired.. What should we do with homosexuals? Pretend they don&rsquo;t exist? Kill them?  Deport them? To where would be deport them? Key West?  Saying that homosexuality is a threat to the West is a paranoid comment. Quoting comments like this can be used by Amren&rsquo;s enemies to make Amren seem hysterical and ignorant. Whatever your opinion is on consenting adults of the same sex, concentrate your efforts on keeping foreign pedophiles,rapists and murderers out of our former safe, white countries. Americans are being raped, murdered, and mutiliated by foreign invaders every day. That is much more serious. Don&rsquo;t hurt our cause by attacking neutral gays. It weakens our message, and it makes Amren look ridiculous. </p>
