			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Women who do not wear headscarves are being threatened with violence and even death by Islamic extremists intent on imposing sharia law on parts of Britain, it was claimed today.</p>
<p>Other targets of the &#8216;Talibanesque thugs&rsquo;, being investigated by police in the Tower Hamlets area of London, include homosexuals.</p>
<p>Stickers have been plastered on public walls stating: &#8216;Gay free zone. Verily Allah is severe in punishment&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Posters for H&M; which feature women in bikinis and a racy poster for a Bollywood film have been defaced.</p>
<p>It is believed Muslim extremists are behind a spate of attacks being investigated by police, according to the Sunday Times.</p>
<p>An Asian woman who works in a pharmacy in east London was told to dress more modestly and wear a veil or the shop would be boycotted. </p>
<p>When she went to the media to talk about the abuse she suffered, a man later entered the pharmacy and told her: &#8216;If you keep doing these things, we are going to kill you&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old, who is not a practising Muslim, said she has since been told to take holiday by the pharmacy owners and now fears she may lose her job.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;Why should I wear a hijab (headscarf) or burqa? I haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other incidents reported include the placing of stickers across the white-minority borough which state it is a &#8216;gay-free zone&rsquo; and the daubing of paint on posters for clothing shop H&M; featuring women in bikinis.</p>
<p>Ghaffar Hussain, of the anti-extremism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, told The Sunday Times that the intimidation was the work of &#8216;Talibanesque thugs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;This minority think they have the right to impose their fringe interpretation of Islam on others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Three men have been charged with religiously-aggravated criminal damage in connection with some of the incidents, which have mirrored crude attempts at censorship in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Borough Commander of Tower Hamlets, Paul Rickett, said: &#8216;I am saddened that there are a small minority of people who do not wish to respect the lifestyle choices of others.</p>
<p>&#8216;I would like to reassure the people of Tower Hamlets that we are investigating these incidents.  </p>
<p>&#8216;At this stage there is no information to suggest any of the incidents are linked. Anyone found committing such criminal acts will face criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8216;We work closely with faith leaders in the community, the Tower Hamlets interfaith forum, our partner agencies and the local community to ensure that people feel safe in the borough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Khalid Mahmood, MP for Birmingham Perry Bar, said he had seen posters vandalised in Birmingham but was not aware of threats being made.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I have seen posters defaced in Birmingham and it&rsquo;s just complete nonsense.</p>
<p>&#8216;If people choose to follow the religion they should be free to do so and we don&rsquo;t want to go down the route that the French have done, but these people have to accept other people. </p>
<p>&#8216;If it&rsquo;s about the freedom to do what you want, others should have the freedom to do what they want to do.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s the actions of a very small minority, and in Birmingham we have not seen people threaten women who are not wearing the burqa  &mdash;  if someone were to do that the police should be informed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Firebrand Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary said that he was aware of individuals who would speak up if they saw a Muslim woman without a headscarf, but insisted they were only giving advice about their views of Islam.</p>
<p>He said no threats would be made and described the allegations of threats of death as &#8216;completely ridiculous&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;There are groups who propagate Islam, and if they see a Muslim woman without a hijab they may say &#8220;sister, it&rsquo;s obligatory that you cover your hair&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s an individual intervention to propagate Islam. For non-Muslims, they may point out to them that women are being exploited in the West.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s about telling people about the preference of covering up, but nobody&rsquo;s going to say &#8220;you are going to be killed&#8221;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tower Hamlets has a reputation for being a centre of Islamic extremism in London.</p>
<p>Recently it was revealed that Rich Dart, a middle-class former BBC worker, had converted to Islam and was living in Bow, east London in a £300,000 flat paid for by benefits.</p>
<p>Despite being unemployed, Mr Dart regularly attends Muslim rallies in which he was recently heard to say: &#8216;When the Taliban defeat the allies we will establish sharia law and take the fight to the enemy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Christmas posters appeared in the borough claiming the religious festival was &#8216;evil&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The campaign&rsquo;s organiser was 27-year-old Abu Rumaysah, who once called for sharia law in Britain at a press conference held by hate preacher leader Anjem Choudary, the leader of banned militant group Islam4UK.</p>
<p>Mr Rumaysah said: &#8216;Christmas is a lie and as Muslims it is our duty to attack it.</p>
<p>&#8216;But our main attack is on the fruits of Christmas, things like alcohol abuse and promiscuity that increase during Christmas and all the other evils these lead to such as abortion, domestic violence and crime.</p>
<p>&#8216;We hope that out campaign will make people realise that Islam is the only way to avoid this and convert.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Any white person, any Jew, any woman or any gay person who supports mulitculturalism is a fool.  Yet it seems most Jewish, women&rsquo;s and gay rights groups either support multiculturalism and dissimilar immigration or, at best, keep quiet.  White political and labor groups are for the most part run buy nitwits and traitors.  </p>
<p>The group that led the way in treating woman and gays fairly is white men.  It was Great Briton and the US that supported the establishment of a Jewish state.  Yet the rights groups associated with the above three demographics do nothing but denounce the white, Christian, patriarcal power structure.  Well, when that power structure has completely collapsed I hope you all enjoy the beatings, stonings and hangings that will be part of daily life for you fools.</p>

		<p>Before the situation at the Alamo became impossible, Col. Travis supposedly drew a line in front of the men and gave every one of them an opportunity to leave without insult or stay knowing it would be a fight to the end. We don&rsquo;t really need Col. Travis to draw that line in the sand. Those who want to run away should do so now. Those that step over the line are full of heart for what comes.</p>
<p>That is the situation in England today. I was there only last spring, both in London and in the north country&hellip;..Newcastle, York and Leeds&hellip;..even spent a few days in Edinburg. England must decide while they can or loose all choice. Fight or flee?<br>

		<p>Gee, Margaret Thatcher.  I thought all these Muslims you let into the country had good strong &#8220;family values.&#8221;  You read that right   &mdash;   It wasn&rsquo;t just Tony Blair who let &#8216;em all in (though the Blair and Brown governments did open the gates wide open)   &mdash;   It actually started with Thatcher.  Just as there is a disturbing trend of Dutcholyatry (Reagan worship) among American conservatives (though I know not here), there is too much Thatcher worship among the same kind of pseudo-&#8220;conservative&#8221; lamestream type on the other side of the pond.</p>

		<p>In the spoils hierarchy it seems to be in descending order: Jews, gays, blacks, women, and then Muslims.  Actually, blacks and gays may be tied  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s not clear.  Anyhow, it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how the multi-cults deal with these contradictions.  Whatever happens, white male Christians are doomed to bottom place as they hold up the totem pole.</p>

<p>I know, I hang out with a lot of artist-types, and I am just amazed at their myopia. <br>
They cannot, will not, challenge the dogmas that were pounded into them from kindergarten upwards. It&rsquo;s as if they are under a spell;  they are incapable of pointing out the obvious; multiculturalism is a liberal white invention, and it will kill liberal whites. It does every day, and still these people&hellip;they just loll about with their high IQs and their twisted beliefs. <br>
It makes me sad to know such a huge proportion of whites below the age of forty are hopelessly brainwashed. </p>

		<p>The irony is that Britain&rsquo;s hard-left and the Labour Party (who, in actual fact, take delight in killing and maiming any White Briton who ever dared to question the wisdom of massive, uncontrolled third world immigration), fetishize homosexuals as &#8216;eternal victims&rsquo; worthy of the most vociferous and vicious &#8216;protection&rsquo; possible against any &#8216;fascist&rsquo; or whatever who ever dared to harm a hair on their heads.<br>
 The irony is that in the pea-brained hierarchy of lefty victimology (their pathetic excuse for any rational political program), brown-skinned immigrants are just about the only group to score higher and thus by their twisted logic are the worthier group, regardless of any injury caused.</p>

		<p>Lawrence Auster of View From the Right recently wrote that, to liberals, there are only 3 types of people:  (to paraphrase) good white liberals, bad white conservatives, and victims of white racism.  Thus, any non-white person is not to be held to account for any of his actions and must be supported by liberals.  Thus, these self-haters encourage the very people who would rape, rob, torture, and murder them and their children.  </p>

		<p>  This is indeed the bitter fruit of multi-culturalism. The fact that the sexual intimidation of women and gays is allowed in formerly Great Britain is unconscionable. It appears that the liberal-minority collusion is not working as expected. The immigrants are demanding that the indigenous peoples of Britain conform to their customs and religion. Years of Neo Marxist&rsquo;s teaching historical guilt and white self-hatred has made the British population apathetic and insensate to the cultural imperialism of the Muslim newcomers. British feminists, frightened of being accused of racism, are silent toward sexist acts committed by anyone but the hated white males. </p>

		<p><i>Except, now they&rsquo;ve invited someone to the party who won&rsquo;t behave.</i></p>
<p>The essence of the multicultist dilemma. </p>
<p>&#8220;Victim&#8221; groups other than Muslims know how to play their part in the continuing farce. But Muslims actually want some real power as opposed to simply being used as muscle against the old order. I think this is one reason that multicultists can not confront Islamic &#8220;sexism&#8221; and &#8220;homophobia.&#8221; It does not fit into the script. </p>
<p>Multicultists, like Machiavelli&rsquo;s &#8220;foxes,&#8221; work best by manipulation and fraud. They can not deal with the &#8220;lions&#8221; who use violence and will not be buffaloed by clever slogans. </p>
<p>So they just hope overt shows of force by Muslims will simply go away, or that the Muslims will change, or that something will happen. Of course, the Muslims (rightly) see these things as signs of weakness and amp up the pressure.</p>
<p>The multicultists can not deal with the fact that they have let the barbarians into the gates. </p>
<p>But perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here? If Muslims can stand down the multicultists by sticking to their guns, then what about other groups? </p>

<p>I agree with your overall comment, but not entirely with your ranking.  I would say: Jews, blacks, Muslims, feminists (not all women), then gays.  Yes,  we do have our sacred minorities, but some are always held more sacred than others. And some  minorities are more equal than others!</p>

<p>Gays are the most recently admitted of the sacred minorities and still have shakey standing. Many do not yet recognize them. The truly royal minorities, however, are completely above reproach or question.  </p>

		<p>I am in London right now and I can only say, after having lived here for four years, its all about Arab money over here.  The Brits know where their scones are buttered.  I was in Selfridge&rsquo;s this evening and was possibly the only non-Muslim other than the employees.  And they were buying up everything.  Same deal with Harrod&rsquo;s last week.  The Muslims are the only ones spending money here.  The Muslim pound is a vital force in the British economy.  </p>
<p>So strange to see the young men dressed in their skin tight Diesel jeans and slicked back hair while the women can only have their eyes exposed and look like black ghosts in the 80 degree heat.  They are truly treated as their husbands&rsquo; chattel.  </p>
