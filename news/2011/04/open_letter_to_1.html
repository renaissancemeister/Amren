	<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note. On April 14, British Prime Minister David Cameron gave a <a href="/news/2011/04/this_will_infla.html">speech on immigration</a>, in which he claimed to understand the problem and pledged to solve it. Frank Ellis, formerly of Leeds University, says the speech is too little, too late.</em></p>
<p>From: Dr Frank Ellis<br>
To: An Open Letter to the Prime Minister, Mr David Cameron MP<br>
Date: 15th April 2011 A.D.<br>
Re: The Prime Minister&rsquo;s Speech on Immigration to Conservative Party Members in Hampshire, 14th April 2011</p>
<p>Dear Mr Cameron:</p>
<p>Once again I am compelled to write to you on the subject of immigration. Having read your speech, I can say that there are parts which show some awareness of the immigration threat. Whether you act is another matter. The long-suffering, white indigenous population has heard the cry of &#8220;It&rsquo;s time to get tough on immigration&#8221; so many times before and on each occasion nothing has happened. Once any election is out of the way the immigration assault on our way life continues its relentless path. Nothing is done to stop the invasion. Whole neighbourhoods are taken over by immigrants and we whites are supposed to pretend that we are being blessed when in fact we are being dispossessed.</p>
<p>You begin your speech by pointing out that last year we were in the middle of a general election campaign. At that time, Labour Leader Gordon Brown took part in a choreographed visit to Rochdale. Thinking his microphone was switched off, he referred to a life-long Labour Party activist as a &#8220;bigot&#8221; because she had complained about high levels of immigration to Britain. Brown&rsquo;s grovelling after his remarks were broadcast did him no good at all. His cowardice and disgusting duplicity were there for all to see and hear. His private response to a perfectly honourable concern about mass immigration reveals not just his horrible, cynical dishonesty but the huge gulf that separates the professional political caste in this country from the electorate. It confirms my suspicion that you and your politician colleagues despise people like me and others who object to mass immigration. You despise us because we categorically reject your hideous multiracial fantasy; you hate us because we see through your lies; you seek to punish us and humiliate us because we resist the Lie; and you long for the day when we are overwhelmed by immigrants and reduced to a cowed racial minority in our ancient lands. </p>
<p>You note the following:</p>
<p>Now, immigration is a hugely emotive subject and it&rsquo;s a debate too often in the past shaped by assertions rather than substantive arguments. We&rsquo;ve all heard them. The assertion that mass immigration is unalloyed good and that controlling it is economic madness, the view that Britain is a soft touch and immigrants are out to take whatever they can get. I believe the role of politicians is to cut through the extremes of this debate and approach the subject sensibly and reasonably.</p>
<p>The reason that &#8216;immigration is a hugely emotive subject&rsquo; is because any attempt to criticize mass immigration has been portrayed by the political caste to which you belong, the BBC, the Guardian-reading classes, the universities and what is erroneously referred to as the teaching profession, as something dreadful. The implicit, often quite explicit, assumption has been that any person who criticizes the level of immigration or who resents the changes that have been imposed on Britain without the consent of the indigenous population, is some kind of Nazi, hell bent on mass murder. Those of us who have attacked the insane levels of immigration have not just made assertions: we have offered compelling arguments to which the BBC, to take just one example, has responded with hysteria and vitriol. </p>
<p>The filters of BBC censorship mean that the grim truth is never fully placed in the public domain or only hinted at, as for example when the BBC reports violent black behaviour in London. You say that public debate was affected because public discussion was closed down and that: &#8216;It created the space for extremist parties to flourish, as they could tell people that mainstream politicians weren&rsquo;t listening to their concerns or doing anything about them&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The last Labour government with the support of your party demonised anyone who pointed out the failures of multiculturalism. It was left to small parties such as the BNP and non-affiliated individuals to state that &#8216;mainstream politicians are not listening to your concerns or doing anything about them&rsquo; for the simple, painfully obvious reason, Mr Cameron, that mainstream politicians were not listening to our concerns or doing anything about them. In other words, Mr Cameron, when the silence of cowardly, careerist politicians was broken by some lone voices, you denigrate them as the mouth pieces of extremist parties whose arguments are not to be heard, even when these supposed extremist parties and individuals are telling the truth and articulating the justified fears of a large majority. And you expect me to trust you and your call for a sensible and reasonable debate on this subject? You want this debate to be on the basis of your ideological assumptions; primarily that multiculturalism and mass non-white immigration are inherently beneficial. Those who object are cast as &#8216;extremists&rsquo;, as somehow incorrigibly wicked.  </p>
<p>Again, you say that you want &#8216;to starve extremist parties of the oxygen of public anxiety they thrive on and extinguish them once and for all&rsquo;. You acknowledge the public anxiety over the immigration issue so what exactly are these extremist parties doing or saying that is wrong and which warrants their being called &#8216;extremist&rsquo;? If there is massive anxiety about immigration (more accurately fear, loathing and disgust), why does it exist? Who or what is to blame? The answer Mr Cameron is: cowardly and lying politicians x cowardly and lying politicians x cowardly and lying politicians = masses of cowardly and lying politicians. </p>
<p>Ever since 1948 immigration has been an issue in Britain, punctuated by race riots and culminating in the Islamic terrorist attacks of Thursday 7th July 2005. Successive governments have tried to ram race-is-a fiction, we-are-the-world and multiculturalism down our throats and when we have retched and vomited this poison out of our bodies, politicians have then resorted to legal and administrative sanctions against us; they have indoctrinated our children to hate their country, its heroes, its past; they have turned children against their parents; they preach hatred of whites; they encourage immigrants to mock us and to take over our towns, cities and neighbourhoods; and our men returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are spat at and reviled by immigrants as war criminals. And in the UN-sponsored world view of multiculturalism which you seem to have totally internalised, we, the white indigenous population, are somehow reduced to the level of extremists because we have had enough of being lied to and because we resent our country being overrun by aliens. </p>
<p>You say that you want &#8216;to get the policy right: good immigration, not mass immigration&rsquo;. To begin with you need to deal, as matter of national priority, with the vast numbers of illegal immigrants currently in the United Kingdom. There must be absolutely no amnesty. Your mission is straightforward: hunt them down, round them up and deport them. What stops you from acting? When the indigenous electorate actually sees wailing illegals being deported, along with all the wives and hordes of other dependents; when the indigenous electorate starts to see that its neighbourhoods are being reclaimed, you might merit some trust: but not before since your credit is exhausted. </p>
<p>As for what you call &#8216;good immigration&rsquo; you claim - politicians always do - that &#8216;Our country has benefitted immeasurably from immigration&rsquo;. That is news to me. When I go through large parts of Britain - Bradford, Slough, Leicester, Birmingham, Leeds and whole swathes of London - I am assailed by sights and sounds that might be appropriate in the Third World but do not belong in England. Third World immigrants recreate the Third World in First World countries. When I go to large parts of England I do not wish to see masses of black and brown faces, bizarre clothing, hordes of immigrant children, freakish behaviour, to hear the invasive cacophony of non-European languages and to see whole streets that look as if they belong in Islamabad or Mogadishu. I do not feel enriched by &#8220;diversity&#8221; or multiculturalism. My reactions are fear, disgust and a horrible nausea. I am of course angry at people like you who have done nothing to prevent this from happening, even when warned of what would happen. </p>
<p>What are people from Uganda, India and Pakistan doing in large numbers in British hospitals? Britain is quiet capable of providing enough staff from the indigenous population. Our training is superior as well. The countries you mention are not exactly known for high standards and good training. The Indian examination system is corrupt and riddled with cheating such that fake degrees and other professional qualifications are easily obtainable at the right price. Pakistan is a Third World slum whose sole export to this country has been terrorism, welfare parasitism and immigrant invaders. Uganda is a sub-Saharan, Third World basket case. Do you really expect me to believe that any training such as it is in Uganda meets First World standards and that lives are not being put at risk by employing Africans? </p>
<p>The case of Daniel Ubani, the Nigerian with a German passport, is just one horrifying example of what can happen when First World standards are jettisoned in the name of multiculturalism and &#8216;good immigration&rsquo;. One Primary Care Trust rejected Ubani because his command of English was so weak. Eventually he secured - somehow - a post and on his first day managed to kill one patient and nearly killed another. The chances are this Nigerian could not read or not very well and that he simply did not understand the correct doses of drugs required. Shortly thereafter he fled back to his &#8216;native&rsquo; Germany. </p>
<p>Your admission that the last government allowed the mass invasion of immigrants into Britain comes far too late: so much damage has already been done. Why did the Conservative Party not highlight this invasion when in opposition? You had every opportunity. Why during this period was it left to non-affiliated individuals and so-called extremists to highlight the dreadful consequences of mass, non-white immigration? By staying silent on the mass immigration invasion between 1997 and 2010 your party colluded with the Labour Party&rsquo;s policy of allowing mass immigration. The Conservative Party therefore bears a great deal of responsibility for what has happened. Too many of your cowardly MPs who knew perfectly well what was happening, failed to stand up and be counted. This is why the Conservative Party can no longer be trusted on anything to do with immigration. </p>
<p>You say that &#8216;real integration takes time&rsquo;. In America they have been trying since 1865 and they have still failed. Large numbers of different racial groups in the same territory is a design for strife, violence, unhappiness, discord and the destruction of individual freedom. For how much longer are you and Trevor Phillips going to tell us that more time is needed so that integration can work or should I say be made to work at the expense of the white, indigenous population? </p>
<p>Integration can never work because most of us have a healthy and wholesome sense of who we are. The natural resistance we manifest frustrates the ambition of the diversophiles, so harsh and repressive legislation must be enacted so that opposition can be bullied and intimidated into silence. At every opportunity your party has connived and colluded with the Labour Party and the emissaries of the European Union in order to silence, to humiliate and to crush dissenters from multiracial orthodoxy. And now you plead for more time so that the hellish designs of multiracialism can be brought to fruition. </p>
<p>Our membership of the European Union is a huge obstacle to preventing and then reducing the levels of legal/illegal immigration. We are also extremely vulnerable to fraudulent claims submitted under various pieces of human rights laws and codes. All and any legislation which prevents us from deporting immigrants and imposing strict border controls must be rescinded.</p>
<p>You mention forced marriages yet I find no mention of Pakistan or other Third World states. In what sense are these girls who are forced into marriages by Pakistani immigrants &#8216;British&rsquo;? They may have acquired a British passport but then as you have conceded they and their families cannot speak &#8216;the same language as those living there&rsquo; and do not want to integrate. By what measure can these people be properly considered to be British</p>
<p>I speak for myself here. though I suspect many people share my views. You say you want openness? Here it is: I do not want to live in a community where I am confronted with hordes of black and brown faces on the streets of our towns and cities; I do not want to socialise with non-white immigrants; if by mistake I walked into a pub full of non-whites, I would leave immediately; I do not want to have to work with these people if it can be avoided; I avoid non-white immigrants at every possible opportunity (if dealing with them is unavoidable, I am polite no more no less); I do not want my children to have to endure the presence of huge numbers of non-white immigrants in their schools; I do not want to be preached to by diversity propagandists, telling me against all the evidence and the screams of my soul that diversity is some kind of blessing (it is nothing of the sort). Diversity is bestial, hateful and loathsome: it is a psychological weapon of war which has been deployed against the white peoples of the world in order to undermine their natural sense of racial and cultural separation, their identity, their natural and proper sense of superiority across the entire spectrum of human endeavour. Diversity is a collectivist refuge for the failure, the loser, the envious and the nation hater-killers.</p>
<p>God bless England, Ireland (both sides of the border), Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Frank Ellis<br>

		<p>WOW.  Well said.  Too late and won&rsquo;t be heeded but deserves a real WOW.  Perhaps some Chinese archeologist, when studying the remains of 21st century Briton, will quote this letter as an ignored warning.  Rather like the Titanic&rsquo;s wireless distress calls were ignored by that mysterious, unidentified nearby ship.</p>

		<p>Wow, what a letter!</p>
<p>I bow to you Frank Ellis for having the courage and conviction to speak up for your beloved England.  These traitors&rsquo; days are numbered because everything they created is falling apart at breakneck speed.  If there truly is justice in the world, people like David Cameron will be forced to live among these invaders one day, on their ancestral land.  Ship them all back with their overlords.<br>

&#8220;Diversity is a collectivist refuge for the failure, the loser, the envious and the nation hater-killers.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have always thought that leftism, and multiculturalism in particular, are just what he described; a supposed safe- haven for people who feel as outcasts, misfits, or who just didn&rsquo;t get enough of mommy and daddy&rsquo;s love growing up, or who were bullied, or who felt inferior. (which is a joke, because EVERYONE has been hurt: welcome to existence in this universe, Libtards!)<br>
 They are people with personality disorders, and significant other psychiatric problems.<br>

		<p>Frank Ellis is correct.<br>
 If the Tories are being serious about tackling Britain&rsquo;s immigration disaster, they must be stout hearted and explicit about what they plan to do, but as their track record shows they are little better than the Labour Party (that is damning with faintest praise), in tackling immigration.<br>
 The Tory introduced immigration acts of 1971 and 1981 which were billed as &#8216;curtailing immigration permanently&rsquo;, did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Ancient lands, people. The ancient lands of all the varied European peoples; the blood-soaked soil that has been fought for over-and-over again in centuries past. Now, large parts of these lands (European living-space) are being given to aliens that hate the very native peoples that their morally corrupt governments have forced them to be neighbours with.<br>

		<p>Another point is that David Cameron strongly favors Turkey&rsquo;s entry into the EU, and has made many vociferous speeches pleading Turkey&rsquo;s case for entry (much to German chagrin, I must add).<br>
 Of Course, Turkish entry into the EU means the *certainty* of massive, uncontrolled Turkish immigration into Britain, immigration that any British government would be utterly, utterly powerless to even raise a whisper of protest, since Britain has precisely zero controls over EU borders.<br>
  As I said before, I simply do not trust Cameron, he is a &#8216;clever&rsquo; tactical poltician, saying the &#8216;right&rsquo; things to the &#8216;right&rsquo; people, but he has an inherent slipperiness about him.</p>

		<p>It is like a pendulum swing.</p>
<p>The more immigration, with current trends, the more nationalist dissent. Current trends will continue until a critical shift in power at the core of a society (I&rsquo;m not talking about alternation between current parties here).</p>
<p>However, we must be careful not to swing back the other way. Victimization argumentation gives rise to altruist motives (which many times is not in the interest in the altruist in question). </p>
<p>This is what happened when Hitler (genocide) or slavery happened. It gave rise to sympathy (which I agree with) however in that sympathy it is/was felt that certain groups are OWED something (I disagree with). For example with slavery, it was 250 YEARS AGO, and I find astonishing that people are still on about something that long ago  &mdash;  as if some invisible force is keeping them down (I really disagree with and find sad). </p>
<p>Self responsibility is correlated with higher intelligence, because the person must confront themselves why things are going the way they want and doesn&rsquo;t easily brush aside the plight as &#8220;someone else&rsquo;s fault.&#8221; Unintelligent people will often blame and not look for possibilities that they could do to change their lives.</p>
<p>That way the Japanese and Chinese people are still indigenousness. They don&rsquo;t have many people to allow for an false assumption that others are just the same. Also they didn&rsquo;t have slavery, etc. There were horrendous things that the Chinese and Japanese done (WW2) however there was no dissent within the country which inevitably manifest into a shift of media that perpetrates multicultural dogma. </p>
<p>However, unlike Liberal fear, homogeneous populations aren&rsquo;t always violent and can&rsquo;t really manifest racism because racism only comes with close proximity with others that are different.</p>
<p>Anyways, I want to congratulate Mr. Ellis for the letter. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so &#8220;fiery&#8221; and the ability to persuade come from calmer language. This will just make the letter not get read (since Mr. Ellis can&rsquo;t force Prime Minister Mr. David to read it). </p>
<p>ALL indigenousness populations have a right to exist. Period.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You say that &lsquo;real integration takes time&rsquo;. In America they have been trying since 1865 and they have still failed. Large numbers of different racial groups in the same territory is a design for strife, violence, unhappiness, discord and the destruction of individual freedom. For how much longer are you and Trevor Phillips going to tell us that more time is needed so that integration can work or should I say be made to work at the expense of the white, indigenous population? </p>
<p>Integration can never work because most of us have a healthy and wholesome sense of who we are. The natural resistance we manifest frustrates the ambition of the diversophiles, so harsh and repressive legislation must be enacted so that opposition can be bullied and intimidated into silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full letter finally gets at the crux of what the real issue is here &mdash; race.  Not IQ, school performance, crime rates, poverty etc &mdash; but race. Discussion of the take-over of White countries in the context of anything else but race shies away from what&rsquo;s really important &mdash; survival of the indigenous Whites. The performance of non-White races in our midst has never really been the point. Rather that their mere presence will cause Whites to become extinct due to the over-breeding of the non-Whites or miscegenation if the Whites can become programmed enough to accept it.</p>
<p>However, his start into the integration solution unnerved me a bit at first. Anyone who would back integration as a final solution is adding another nail to the coffin of Whites. After all integration/assimilation is naught but thinly veiled code for intermarriage. Mr. Ellis did redeem himself at the last with &#8220;or should I say be made to work at the expense of the white, indigenous population?&#8221; And then with the subsequent explanation of why integration is not an answer for White survive.  No groveling, no apologies. This is how Whites need to be.</p>
<p>*****************************************************************</p>
<p>The paragraph below is a true jewel.  This is the healthy attitude we Whites need to adopt to survive.  No more talk of integration, definitely no free pass given to Asians because of the obscenely overly-praised Bell Curve.   Just simply White societies for White people alone because they&rsquo;re ours.  No justification necessary. No sugar-coating, no statistics on crime or education required.  The honest racial reason should suffice. (I would add &#8220;yellow&#8221; to &#8220;with hordes of black and brown faces&#8221;  &mdash;  - East Asians need to stay home too.)</p>
<p>&rdquo;I speak for myself here. though I suspect many people share my views. You say you want openness? Here it is: I do not want to live in a community where I am confronted with hordes of black and brown faces on the streets of our towns and cities; I do not want to socialise with non-white immigrants; if by mistake I walked into a pub full of non-whites, I would leave immediately; I do not want to have to work with these people if it can be avoided; I avoid non-white immigrants at every possible opportunity (if dealing with them is unavoidable, I am polite no more no less); I do not want my children to have to endure the presence of huge numbers of non-white immigrants in their schools; I do not want to be preached to by diversity propagandists, telling me against all the evidence and the screams of my soul that diversity is some kind of blessing (it is nothing of the sort). Diversity is bestial, hateful and loathsome: it is a psychological weapon of war which has been deployed against the white peoples of the world in order to undermine their natural sense of racial and cultural separation, their identity, their natural and proper sense of superiority across the entire spectrum of human endeavour.&#8221; </p>
<p>By the by,  I haven&rsquo;t seen any of those wonderful posts from John PM in awhile. Best regards, John, hope you are well.</p>

		<p>For readers that are new to the world of segregation and multi-culturism, may I suggest they study the precedent in South Africa - a country of minorities where the smallest English/British minority imposed their will on the collective majority.</p>
<p>A precise&rsquo; history from 1834 to the present is as follows:</p>
<p>The Boere (Dutch) left the Cape to escape British oppression and established their republics of Transvaal and Orange Free State. They had no desire to conquer, integrate and rule black Africans. They were content to live apart in peace alongside them.</p>
<p>The British followed the Boere and conquered them in order to gain control of their diamond and gold wealth. Along the way they conquered the black tribes as well.</p>
<p>The British created the Union of South Africa in 1910 - a unitary multi-culti state that ruled 9 different black tribes, an Asian community, a Mixed-race/Coloured/Mulatto (e.g. President Obama) community, the White African Boere/Afrikaners and the White African English/British</p>
<p>In 1948 the Afrikaner Nationalists came to power and organised South Africa to conform to their republic model - i.e. creating separate territories where each ethnic group could pursue their self determination - just like the UK with Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p>
<p>They inherited a plethora of racist laws started in 1806 in the British colonies of Cape and Natal. This was the status quo which they called Apartheid. (Ref:https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/)</p>
<p>The rest of the world, via The United Nations, objected to the full evolution of these &#8220;segregationist&#8221; policies and branded them:<br>
&#8220;A Crime Against Humanity&#8221; </p>
<p>In 1994 a majority rule (where each black tribe is as different from each other as a Frenchman is to a German) multi-culti state was forced on white South Africans by the liberal west. </p>
<p>Since &#8220;freedom&#8221; with a murder rate of 50/day about 320,000 South Africans have perished in this utopia. Within that figure are about 40,000 whites. This includes 3,000+ farmers and family who have been brutally slaughtered. <br>
(Ref. www,censorbugbear.com)</p>
<p>What goes around comes around.<br>
The UK is now at it&rsquo;s own multi-culti crossroads, created and encouraged by the likes of Michael Portillo (ex member of Parliament, now TV political commentator) who see merit in this artificial diversity. </p>
<p>The genie is now out of the bottle.<br>
The British National Party has warned that in about 2050 white Britains will wake up to discover that they are a minority in the land of their birth. The BNP has been villified as racists-nazis-facists etc by the minority liberal left media. </p>
<p>An Oxford academic recently published a paper saying exactly the same thing.<br>
NOT A PEEP (about being racist) in the media from the left.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how and if Celtic Brits can turn this situation around.</p>
<p>Once again look at the South African experience.<br>
In 1900 there were 1m whites and 3m blacks in what became the Union.<br>
In 1990 there were 5m whites and 35 m blacks when apartheid ended.<br>
This black population explosion was created by white goodwill: <br>
a health service; a stable nutritious food supply that eliminated famine; a police force that kept the warring tribes apart, education and an emerging industrial cash economy which provided access to all western benefits.<br>
Within this process all ethnic groups were encouraged to retain their own identities and NOT integrate.<br>
The United Nations called this A Crime Against Humanity.</p>
<p>David Cameron refers to maintaining good. immigration. <br>
Does he mean only white Caucasian Christians, and/or dispossessed Rhodesian/Zimbabwean farmers who&rsquo;s fathers fought alongside the Brits in WWII to save them from being overrun by the Nazis? </p>
<p>Wherever Enoch Powell, who warned in a speech in the 1960s that this state would come to pass, is right now I bet he is saying; &#8220;I told you so&#8221;</p>
<p>David Cameron&rsquo;s speech is really a desperate attempt to save the centrerist political parties in UK. The full extent of the population&rsquo;s discontent with immigration has been revealed to him and they are now trying to contain it. It is too little too late.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what proposals and solutions Nationalist Britons have to claim back the UK they want.</p>

<p>I am not a &#8220;Brit&#8221;, I am an Englishman.</p>
<p>And I am not &#8220;Celtic&#8221;, but Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>The (Celtic) Scots and Welsh now have their own Parliament or Assembly, just as the (Celtic) Irish Republic has for some time had complete indenpendence from Westminster.</p>
<p>The (Anglo-Saxon) English (or what remains of us after years of uncontrolled mass immigration from the Third World) have no Parliament of our own.</p>
<p>Celtic secessionism, born of resentment of the English, has been a major driver behind mass immigration and multiculturalism, whose main victims have been the English. Celts (and especially Scots) are massively over-represented in the Labour Party, which has done so much to damage and disadvantage England, with a view to its ultimate destruction.</p>

		<p>@#12-anon: public school children are &#8220;diagnosed&#8221; with &#8216;add&rsquo; and the pills the ignorant parents force down the helpless child&rsquo;s throat actually cause the chemical brain damage necessary for leftism. Psychiatry has always been an industry of death.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to remember that all politicians cannot be trusted.<br>
I weep for England and the Anglo-Saxons. All ethnic groups of the White race should be free to practice their unique cultures.<br>
White World: Wake up, stop caring about &#8216;diversity&rsquo;,  feeling sorry/guilty for those that claim to be victims, and Do something to save your countries! <br>
