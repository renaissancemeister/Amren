<h1>Night Stalker Is Jailed for 27 Years and Told He May Never Be Released</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Cheston, This Is London, March 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Night Stalker Delroy Grant was jailed for life today and told he may never be released from prison.</p>
<p>Moments earlier he was confronted in court by one of his elderly victims, who said she would never recover from the trauma the serial sex attacker caused her.</p>
<p>The 85-year-old woman, named only as Miss J, described how Grant&rsquo;s assault forced her out of her home of 60 years in Shirley and destroyed the last years of her life. &#8220;Time is not a great healer. The memories will never be erased,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>At Woolwich crown court today, Judge Peter Rook gave Grant, 53, of Brockley, four life sentences with a minimum term of 27 years. He will not be allowed to apply for parole until he is 79 and can only be freed if he is no longer considered a danger.</p>
<p>Yesterday Grant was found guilty of 29 specimen charges of burglaries and sex attacks over 17 years. But police believe his reign of terror across south London could amount to 1,000 attacks in two decades.</p>
<p>A senior officer has apologised for police blunders which allowed him to roam free for so long.</p>
<p>Judge Rook said: &#8220;It may be you will never be released. Your utter depravity knows no bounds. For 17 years, over five south London boroughs, you terrified a whole community. Thousands of people have been living in fear over whether they will be your next victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of Grant&rsquo;s victims were in their eighties and living on their own. &#8220;Homes should have been their safest refuge,&#8221; said the judge. &#8220;It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the extreme fear  &mdash;  the feel of your gloved hand, the sight of your masked figure looming over them  &mdash;  that must have been felt by your victims in their beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shone a torch in their terrified eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and left a trail of distress, fear and misery. You have never shown any remorse. You appear to have no feelings whatsoever for your victims. You will only be released if the parole board consider it safe to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt you are a very, very dangerous man.&#8221; Grant maintained a stony expression, an arrogant sneer spreading occasionally across his face. At one stage he shook his head vigorously and turned to a woman dock officer for sympathy. She looked away.</p>
<p>Earlier, Miss J, a small, bespectacled lady with grey hair, was helped into the court. She told how she had lived alone for 21 years and never felt threatened before the attack in March 2003.</p>
<p>In a statement read to the court, she said: &#8220;I have not got back my peace of mind. I found myself gradually feeling depressed. Nobody can provide me with the security I needed and I decided I had to move house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take antidepressant pills. I don&rsquo;t really tell my family everything. I just felt &#8216;why did he want to do these things?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>

						<p>Delroy Grant  &mdash;  the &#8220;Night Stalker&#8221;  &mdash;  has been jailed for life with a minimum of 27 years. Judge Peter Hook set out the severity of his crimes. Here are his sentencing comments:</p>
<p>&#8220;Delroy Grant. Your utter depravity knows no bounds.</p>
<p>The 18 victims of your offending were all elderly. In respect of nine of them, not only did you break into their homes in the middle of the night, that invasion being a highly traumatic experience for them in itself, but you then proceeded to subject them to humiliating and degrading sexual attacks.</p>
<p>Your offending spanned a period of 17 years. Five south London boroughs were affected by your offending. Over 17 years you have terrified a whole community. As your counsel accepted, thousands of people in south London have been living in fear that they might be your next victim.</p>
<p>It also led to an enormous drain on police resources as the years went by and you evaded arrest. Your offending led to the largest hunt for a serial rapist ever conducted in London.</p>
<p>This series of offences have multiple aggravating features. Your offending falls in a category of its own, way above anything envisaged in the definitive sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>You targeted elderly victims living alone. Your actions blighted the remaining years of their lives. Their homes, where many of them had lived for years, should have been their safest refuge, where they could expect to live their lives undisturbed and at peace. You chose to invade their homes when they were in bed at night.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine the extreme fear that the feel of your gloved hand and the sight of your masked figure looming above them must have been felt by your victims in their beds.</p>
<p>Those who you raped or attempted to rape were all over 80. Many of your victims were in poor health.</p>
<p>Since in every case but one, your elderly victims lived on their own, I can only conclude that these offences were well-planned and you targeted victims. Singling out your victims must have involved considerable planning, as you chose the most vulnerable of people.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, you would wake your victims who would be sleeping in their own beds by placing a gloved hand over their mouths to stop them screaming. You would shine your torch into their terrified eyes. You would search their homes and steal their money.</p>
<p>I am not going to catalogue in detail the trail of distress, fear and misery you have left behind you.</p>
<p>There can be only one sentence and that is life imprisonment. I have no doubt that these offences are of such seriousness that a life sentence is appropriate to reflect the public abhorrence at your offending.</p>
<p>You are a very dangerous man capable of committing heinous crimes and causing incalculable harm to people. It will be a matter for the Parole Board whether you ever be released. It may be that you will never be released.</p>
<p>Your offending is in a league of its own.</p>
<p>I must look at the totality of your offending. I bear in mind that you are now 53. If this was a determinate sentence, a total sentence of 54 years would be appropriate. This means the minimum term will be one of 27 years, less the time you have spent in custody. I am told that is one year and 129 days. That makes the total minimum sentence 25 years, 236 days.</p>
<p>I stress that is the minimum term you must serve.</p>
<p>It will follow automatically that you will be placed on the Sexual Offences Register for life.&#8221;<br>

<p>This predatory animal was allowed to be on the loose for so long and NOT caught? The English at one time were noted for having the finest police force in the world, Scotland Yard and all that, eh&rsquo; wot&#8221;! And NOW!</p>
<p>And my guess would be that the vast majority of the victims were white or perhaps exclusively so? Some Englishman or woman can comment on this?</p>
<p>They say you can tell a lot about a criminal by noting what sort of persons are victimized by the beast. In this case, the latent coward is after those that can least defend themselves. <br>
The weak, the old, the sick, etc. Delroy is a depraved person in the extreme, no excuse for this one. And the English do not have the death penalty for such crimes, perhaps the U.S. does not either. Delroy will live now on the English dime [pence] for some time and be happy.</p>
<p>And it took ALMOST TWENTY YEARS TO CATCH THIS GUY? Great police work Scotland Yard. Promotions for everyone.</p>

		<p>There are many, many more where this lower primate came from.<br>
And they have become increasingly bolder as time passes. The <br>
O. J. verdict and its reaction demonstrate that a black perp <br>
will always find support when he selects white victims. The <br>
comments on local crime always illustrate this.<br>

		<p>&#8220;A senior officer has apologised for police blunders which allowed him to roam free for so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>That one sentence says it all about cops and high profile heinous serial criminal cases.  </p>
<p>If you see one of these &#8220;police blunders&#8221;, you will never feel the same about law enforcement again.  I&rsquo;ve seen one case and I&rsquo;m so glad the offender killed himself before I became aware of what he was doing.  Years late I did a little research and found many more cases where the cops are to blame for letting the type &#8220;roam free for so long&#8221;.  In so many cases the police and agents knew who was doing it and knew it could continue.  When innocent witnesses call the police or talk to these agents, the witnesses are often harassed and threatened by the police and agents until the witnesses stop talking.  Evidence often disappears. Often the offender threatens the witnesses who called the police.</p>
<p>Nothing will change until we start seeing senior officers go to jail when they knowingly let the heinous serial criminals continue to roam free for so long.  Nothing happened to the cops who let Jaycee Dugard remain a sex slave for 18 years even though neighbors called the cops about children being kept in the sexual offender Phillip Garrido&rsquo;s back yard. The cops did nothing except let Garrido know someone called the cops on him about having children camping in his back yard.  Apparently one neighbor moved months after calling the cops.  The California State Inspector General did a report in 2009 finding systemic problems.  Jaycee Dugard was awarded $20 million by the state government.  One of those deputies or parole agents was transferred to another location, similar to how the Roman Catholic Church has done with the priests who continue raping children over a number of decades.</p>
<p>Senior officer apology not accepted!</p>

		<p>An unemployed black father of 10 is Britain&rsquo;s most prolific rapist. What a surprise. Not. </p>
<p>When collared by the lazy pigs in the Met he tried to blame one of his sons. He then said that his wife who he left in the 70s had planted his dna in one of his early 90s attacks. </p>

		<p>Absolutely no information has been disclosed in the UK media concerning the race of these elderly defenceless victims (elderly men were victims too) of Delroy Grant&rsquo;s sexual depravity. The police stated that under questioning Grant revealed no motive for his horrendous crimes and that they are completely baffled as to his motive for committing them. I&rsquo;m no expert on psychological profiling but&hellip; that statement would appear totally ludicrous if it turns out that Grant victim&rsquo;s were exclusively or overwhelmingly white. </p>
<p>But perhaps Grant has been leaned on to make a deal, he said very little at the trial except to deny everything, and the issue of race, of course, was never raised. We may never know if Grant almost exclusively targeted whites. This is now how things are done in today&rsquo;s politically-correct UK.</p>
<p>Some police officers believe that Grant may have committed 500-600 offences or even more, with many elderly victims reporting a burglary but too ashamed to disclose the gruesome details of his sexual depravity to the police.</p>

		<p>These are not police &#8220;blunders&#8221;; they are incompetance and negligence on the part of people who simply do not care one iota about the quality of the work they produce.</p>
<p>My co-worker and I were robbed at gunpoint in August 2004.  The robber got away with about $500 of the store&rsquo;s money.  He was also caught in New Mexico because police were able to retrieve his fingerprints from the front counter.  He is currently serving time in New Mexico for armed robberies he committed there (apparently he drove from Albuquerque to Denver and back, committing robberies both ways).  The Colorado Springs police lunched the case against this guy by losing both the fingerprint evidence and the store&rsquo;s security video footage.  They simply didn&rsquo;t care enough to keep a videotape around.<br>

		<p> Apparently back in the 90s there were a number of  prominent black activists  and  black hacks writing and lobbying against  the polce and establishment for describing the suspect as black, though the police, even then, due to DNA testing, were  almost 99.9% certain he was black. Now there are questions being asked in certain newspapers why this man was E fitted as White. The excuse from one  blogger is that the police always lighten E Fits of suspects to  make their features more discernible.</p>
<p>Yep, pull the other one mate, it&rsquo;s got bells on. As we say in England. Oh and  btw, ask anyone  in the streets over here who the &#8216;Night Stalker&rsquo; is or what he  did and they will look at you and say, &#8216;who?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how well the msm have managed to keep this covered when compared to how they tend to  report on white serial maniacs. </p>
<p><br>
 &#8221; The Police have apparently known for a long time that the stalker was a black man. So why does the E-Fit picture show a white man? How many leads were missed or not even reported because of this - and how many crimes was he left to commit as well? People might have died because of this.</p>

Tom **** said: </p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t this being commented on more? Why are the national newspapers running this story with an e-fit of an obviously white man when the culprit is known to be Afro-Caribbean? To demonstrate what he doesn&rsquo;t look like? Why not show an e-fit of an Asian woman- since he doesn&rsquo;t look like that either? Or an e-fit of a badger? How long did it take the police to solve this? </p>

<p> I understand now that the efit is used to lighten the pictures so as to make out features. </p>

<p>Apparently a white male in his 20s. The police released this photograph despite having samples of his DNA which clearly indicated that his ethnic origin was predominately sub-saharan African. In fact the DNA samples suggested that he was, more specifically, from the West Indies. Some of his victims complained at the time that this wasn&rsquo;t a great likeness, and described their assailant as &ldquo;black&rdquo;.</p>

<p>NO brainer here. This man Delroy is behaving in the manner of &#8220;Soul on Ice&#8221; Eldridge Cleaver. Raping elderly white women is a form of &#8220;making pay for yesterday&#8221;. Getting revenge on whitey and just a sheer enjoyment of defiling the white person and being in charge, with &#8220;power&#8221;.</p>

		<p>UPDATE FROM BNP: </p>
<p>A Freedom of Information request submitted by the Croydon branch of the British National Party has revealed what the media refused to say, that all of the victims of the Jamaican &ldquo;Night Stalker&rdquo; Delroy Grant were white. </p>
<p><br>
Spot the difference. Left: Police e-fit of Delroy Grant. Right: Grant&rsquo;s photo The hushed-up revelation comes after Grant, one of Britain&rsquo;s most prolific and depraved sex attackers, was sentenced to at least 27 years in prison for a string of rapes and assaults on old elderly white men and women, some as old as 89, over a period of seventeen years.</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s crime spree was allowed to continue for so long due to a series of police blunders, including officers mixing him up with another man of similar name in 1999, after a member of the public gave police Grant&rsquo;s correct car registration number.</p>
<p>That led to Grant being eliminated from police enquiries, meaning subsequent positive identifications of him were ignored. A detective even visited Grant&rsquo;s home to check on his movements on the night of the 1999 burglary, but as no-one was home, no follow-up action was taken. </p>
<p>From 2001, the police also issued a photo fit of a seemingly white suspect, despite the fact that they knew the culprit was black, completely misleading witnesses who might have any information.</p>
<p>Shortly after Grant&rsquo;s conviction, Tony Martin, the British National Party Croydon and Sutton Branch Organiser, submitted an FOI request to the Metropolitan Police Service, in which he asked for the races of the victims of Grant to be revealed.</p>
<p>The response, from Andrew Beaumont of the Specialist Crime Directorate branch of the Met, simply stated, &ldquo;The victims of Delroy Grant are all Caucasian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Grant was convicted for 29 offences, consisting of burglaries, indecent assaults, rapes and sex assaults, police suspect he is actually guilty of many more offences. Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton put the figure at more than 600, while other sources have speculated that the total could be closer to 1,000 attacks.</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s known offences took place in South East London, in Warlingham, Shirley, Beckenham, Bromley, Addiscombe, Orpington and West Dulwich.</p>
<p>Many of his victims were blind, deaf or had dementia. Grant refuses to admit his crimes or offer any explanation for them.</p>
<p>Of course, as well as never before specifying the racial make-up of Grant&rsquo;s victims, no mention was made by the police or media as to whether Grant&rsquo;s attacks were of a racist nature, something that would have certainly not been the case if the roles were reversed.</p>
<p>As South East London has a large non-white population, consideration should at least be made as to why all of the victims were white. Instead, media reports simply identified the rapist&rsquo;s targets as &ldquo;elderly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that not just police incompetence but also political correctness has negatively affected this case, which has seen a huge number of Britons again suffer unnecessarily as a result of third world immigration.</p>
