			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Rodriguez, Mercury News, April 27, 20911</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few years ago, Laurie Jones Neighbors wanted to know whether the Bay Area&rsquo;s rich cultural diversity was reflected on local boards and commissions, the sort that deal with apartment rents, public buses, air pollution and other realities of everyday urban life.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was very little representation of people of color and low-income people,&#8221; she said after canvassing dozens of agencies. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not going to arrive at a just society that way.&#8221; </p>
<p>The nonprofit organization she works for, Urban Habitat, won a grant to recruit and train low-income minorities and get them appointed. Two years later, the Oakland-based group has placed all of its first class of 26 on local boards and has another group in the pipeline.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People think the Bay Area doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of work to do because it&rsquo;s so diverse, but the contrary is true,&#8221; said Lester Deanes, assistant dean for student life at Santa Clara University and a co-organizer of the conference.</p>
<p>Speakers from at least 15 campuses, including San Jose State, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and De Anza College, will lead discussions at 40 workshops. A panel by Google, the conference&rsquo;s main sponsor, will explore the &#8220;opportunities and challenges of diversity&#8221; in the technology industry.</p>
<p>Ten years after Asians, Latinos and other minorities became the majority in much of Silicon Valley, scholars and other observers say these groups still lack political power, which can&rsquo;t be explained by the natural lag time associated with first-generation immigrants. For example, a recent report by this newspaper based on 2010 U.S. census results revealed that minorities now outnumber whites almost 2-to-1 in Santa Clara County, but whites still hold three-quarters of the seats on town and city councils. The city of Santa Clara, home to Santa Clara University and the conference, has one of the county&rsquo;s four all-white councils.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nancy Arvold, a San Mateo County social worker with a doctorate in white studies, will describe how even liberal whites fail to recognize the privileges they have enjoyed without knowing it, or subtle racial prejudices and stereotypes they may harbor. &#8220;We white people need to do some deep work,&#8221; Arvold said.<br>

		<p>  Every time a minority gets the position that a White earned, we should rejoice.  For a White to have a shot at a good job, he must be spouting all the diversity muck that is demanded as an article of faith.  </p>
<p>When diversity loving Whites get punished by diversity because they still retain too much White privilege, we enjoy the revenge of racial poetic justice.</p>
<p>If we are punished for our White privilege, shouldn&rsquo;t we hope that liberal elite Whites are punished for theirs?</p>
<p>Time for racial Marxism:  If all Whites can&rsquo;t enjoy our privilege, then non should.<br>

		<p>&#8220;THere was very little representation of people of color and low-income people,&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to arrive at a just society that way.&rdquo; </p>
<p>These very same people never seem to mind when, for example, there isn&rsquo;t a single female garbage collector anywhere in the city, or when some mental instutitions have a greater preponderance of some groups over others, and they never argue for greater white participation or &#8216;inclusion&rsquo; or &#8216;integration&rsquo; in a city, school yard or workplace that has a majority of people of color, quite the opposite&hellip; It&rsquo;s always nice, happy, and concerned talk but at the end of the day, any organization that advocates &#8216;diversity&rsquo; or writes up a diversity statement is also actively discriminating against whites as their literal definition of diversity. </p>
<p>Diversity is just a one-way street where people of color are all vital angels from heaven and all white people are bad guys, to one degree or another, and anyone who might object is &#8216;Nazi&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>That first group of 26 that got &#8216;placed&rsquo; (with direct help) on the boards replaced 26 white people who used to hold those positions.  The next group will replace a similar number of whites and so on.</p>
<p>White liberals will only be happy when there are no whites in power anywhere.  Oh, but their own individual positions are exempted.</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  - White studies?  They have that now?  I bet it doesn&rsquo;t focus on white history and culture in the same way that black studies (or chicano or asian studies) celebrates those cultures.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s  certainly hot our fault!  Nobody is keeping them out.   In fact, they&rsquo;re being begged to come in.   They generally don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with such stuff.  Minorities (here meaning especially blacks and Hispanics)  typically have little interest in participating in civic matters or donating their time.  (They just want to benefit.)  It&rsquo;s the same reason they don&rsquo;t donate blood or body organs (but want to get them). Asians tend to be clannish and stick to their own communities, outside of which many have little interest.</p>
<p>And have you ever been present at a meeting at which there are more than a few blacks?  I have.  Sheer chaos!  Shouting and interruptions and disregard of the rules of procedure or any respect for the right of others to speak.  Nothing can get done.</p>
<p>A room full of blacks is the definition of a riot.</p>

<p>What perversity!  When a culture is set up by a people, that people will benefit most from it and ought to.  When non-members are either invited in or break in, they ought to realize that the systems will be screwed toward those who built them.  No one should be ashamed of enjoying their own culture or system, which is well deserved.  No one has an obligation to get up from their food at the table and give their place to someone else just because they showed up.  No one ought to feel self-conscious about it.  </p>
<p>If liberal whites understood what their superficial beliefs about race really meant, they would change their minds.  Most liberal whites are so because it is a style, not because of its racial implications.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because most of the 30-60 year old people who usually hold such positions are still white. Moreover, there is still some of that old 1950s style civic duty nonsense alive in older white people.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t care if all those white people are kicked out of office. Not a one of &#8216;em does anything for us.</p>

		<p>Over twenty years ago I was living in a fairly decent part of Oakland, CA and I would frequently visit Berkeley. I was always on a quest for used books. One of my enlightening moments came one day when I happened to walk past a local high school that must have been on lunch break. The building was rectangular and as I strolled by I noticed the racial segregation that appeared on the three sides of the school that were visible. On one side there were all Asians, on another all Whites, and on  another all Mexican. At least this is how it appeared. Maybe there were a few from each group that intermixed, but not very noticeable. I did not notice any Blacks, but the back of the building was invisible so they must have hung out on that side. </p>

<p>&#8216;Comrades. The promise of the glorious revolution have yet to be realized. Minorities are the majority but they have failed to seize control and weld their power! Now is the time! When the white man is forced to reliquish control, equality for all will be achieved! Join us! Support our cause, YOUR cause! The promise of a perfect world is in your grasp!&rsquo;<br>

		<p>The Bay Area news media has recently started reporting this type of story. There are no complaints about job performance or poor services in some areas or neighborhoods. The officials are responsibly doing their duty to the communities. The problem is that they are white.</p>

		<p>No, Ms. Arvold, whites do NOT have any work at all to do.  Most of us have gone to school, gotten our education, and gotten careers to support ourselves.  The people with the WORK to do are the blacks and other minorities who refuse to stay in school, have babies at 14, and suck off the welfare teats for the rest of their lives, while teaching their usually illigitimate offspring to do the same.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent Nelson (University of Arkansas - Little Rock) did a study a number of years back which showed that Scandinavians and Irish Catholics are the most politically active white ethnic groups, and whites in general are way more politically active than non-white races.</p>

		<p>&#8220;social worker with a doctorate in white studies&#8221;: What the heck? Did she get a paid scholarship for this course of study? Otherwise, just what is it that people don&rsquo;t get about White privilege? I&rsquo;m White, and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;m privileged. You could take all the material possessions I have, and I&rsquo;d still have the privilege of being White.  Non-Whites will never have this privilege, no matter how much wealth they have, take from us, or however much we give them. The article comments on minority-majorities basically complaining of White privilege regarding political power, but wherever these minorities came from, they were already in the majority -there-and their race held political power.  They then voluntarily moved into White areas; no one forced them to do so.</p>

		<p>Liberals always seem to get the gradient of this type of &#8216;function&rsquo; type of relationship the wrong way around.</p>
<p>Example: I recently watched a YT video where Rachel Maddow and Micheal Moore were both laughing at the fact that in (I can&rsquo;t where) a very low crime majority White area, also happened to have a very high rate of gun ownership. So instead of seeing the guns ownership rate as a positive, as it was a crime deterent. <br>
(Where low crime is a positive function of high gun ownership).</p>
<p>They were smugly laughing, while implying &#8220;oh those scared White people are so stupid, as they&rsquo;re armed to the teeth and there is virtually no crime&#8221;. <br>
(Where high gun ownership rates becomes a negative function of White fear of non existant crime). </p>
<p>I see the same twisted logic here. <br>
Instead of seeing civic (or whatever) representation, as being a positive function of success/ achievement/ ability.<br>
These liberals see this situation as a lack of diverse representation, as a negative function of White privlege. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the input and output variables the wrong way around.<br>
When you inverse the axes, you make a positive gradient into a negative gradient. <br>
It warps the situation into a sort of manipulative side ways truth, that isn&rsquo;t really lying or ultimately telling the truth, and it just feels wrong.<br>
The truth doesn&rsquo;t seem to get much air time these days. </p>

		<p>Whites need to do some work? Criminy, whites have been doing most of the work from the beginning. And what do they get for it? Little thanks and mostly complaints and idiotic articles from people who have only a demented education and twisted outlook.</p>
<p>I moved to Japan many years ago. It has many good things, but I love it here more for what it does not have   &mdash;   things that my relatives in the U.S. have to endure but I do not, thank goodness. I had always planned on going back to retire, but why?

		<p>Complaining about &#8220;White privilege&#8221; is just a weapon that privileged Whites use against the rest of us.  They want to defend poor, oppressed blacks from our White privilege, which we don&rsquo;t have, by using their power in positions of authority (White privilege they do have) to block our advancement while promoting non qualified blacks to our jobs.</p>
<p>They are playing a crass game of chance. They hope that as long as they are hurting us down here below, that the blacks will let them keep their jobs. It&rsquo;s symbiotic.  The blacks play along, because they know that as soon as one of their own becomes the king, he won&rsquo;t share the wealth like the &#8220;compassionate, sensitive&#8221; Whites do.</p>
<p>Blacks know they can&rsquo;t shake down each other, so they&rsquo;d rather have Whites controlling the money, so that the money will keep flowing to them instead of getting all bottled up in and embezzlement scheme by some light skinned black who acts white.</p>
<p>We, the White Community, have a first duty:  disarm privileged Whites of the privilege they use against us.</p>
<p>We deserve better than we are getting, and if they are the ones who are keeping us from getting our due, then they must be held to account, and we are the accountants. We can do it now, or we can let the blacks do for us, but sadly, that will be much too late&hellip;</p>

		<p>Whites selling out do it for their own benefit, and is the cheapest way to get along with non-whites, but is short lived. Self hating (one&rsquo;s race) buys a shallow friendship with non-whites who will eventually take over and do a number on us when the time comes. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;We white people need to do some deep work,&rdquo; Arvold said.</p>
<p>What she&rsquo;s really saying: &#8220;YOU (conservative) white people need to do some deep work. We (self-proclaimed) progressives are Tolerant, Enlightened, and Better Than You, and Can Do No Wrong. You must surrender your neighborhoods, your schools, your liberty, and your daughters to the Black/Brown Tide of Multiculturalism. Meanwhile, we will continue to live in our high-rent gated communities and send our children to lily-white private schools, and rest assured that if MY daughter ever brings home a black &#8220;date&#8221;, she will be disowned faster than you can slap an Obama bumper sticker on a brand new Prius. But I want to force YOUR daughters to &#8220;date&#8221; Leroy, Tyrone, and Pablito at gunpoint.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what white leftists - ALL of them - would say if they were honest. But of course, they&rsquo;re not. </p>
<p>Calling white leftist race traitors &#8220;self-hating&#8221; is not accurate. They don&rsquo;t hate themselves. They hate US&hellip;to the point of wanting to kill us off (see: Tim Wise and his desire for genocide against white conservatives). They use blacks and browns as biological weapons against us. They are not misguided, they are evil. Many, if not most, of them are fully aware of the White Traitor Elites&rsquo; plan to race-replace us. They go along with it because they foolishly believe that they can be a part of the White Elite, the only whites who will be allowed to survive. If those things do come to pass they&rsquo;re going to get a very unpleasant surprise from the REAL White Elite.</p>
<p>White leftists like Ms. Arvold do not deserve our pity. They do what they do out of malice, not ignorance.</p>
<p>I bet this hypocrite, if she&rsquo;s married, is married to a white man, and never even considered dating anyone but white men. Yet if I turned down a &#8220;date&#8221; from DeMarcus, she&rsquo;d instantly call me an evil racist Nazi bigot.</p>
<p>If God doesn&rsquo;t put a serious smackdown on these race traitors real soon, He owes Sodom and Gomorrah an apology.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a bad thing that whites in the Bay Area are soon to be a minority in the government of that region. They should.</p>
<p>The Bay Area is a well known bastion of white liberalism. Very liberal whites. And they&rsquo;ve been ruling that area for several decades now. And soon they won&rsquo;t be. </p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll get to find out what the multicultural society they&rsquo;ve been advocating for is REALLY like.</p>
<p>It will be amusing to see the on average wealthier white liberals react to how hispanics, both citizens and illegals, vote to improve their parts of town with white tax dollars. In fact this is the future of the Bay Area, as the various racial/ethnic enclaves take power and vote themselves the benefits of white liberal tax dollars.</p>
<p>It will be amusing to see white liberals paying very high California property taxes to fund public schools forced to put their children into private schools rather than putting their children through the hellhole of public schools crowded with the latino underclass. Public schools will be paid for by white liberals, yet unusable by them. Serves them right.</p>
<p>It will be amusing to see white liberals despair at ever seeing their beloved Bay Area being the same again, as Asians of all types brought over on H1B visas chain immigrate all their extended family over, forever overcrowding the Bay Area and changing the demographic balance.</p>
<p>The highly paid white upper class liberals of Silicon Valley and the Bay Area are in for a bleak future. A future where they will be paying for the policies implemented by non-whites that benefit non-whites.</p>
<p>Have fun with that!</p>

<p>I absolutely second Vick&rsquo;s comments that the PC unbearable white lefty libs are going to get their comeuppance but good. I lived in the East Bay for years as well as in Santa Clara and San Francisco.</p>
<p>By the way, I totally disagree with John Engelman on term limits, next to Prop 13 they are the best thing that ever happened to California. The Left hates them because all their LibDem career hacks get turned out.</p>
<p>Since all the whites in local offices here are worthless we should not make an effort to save them.</p>
<p>Local government in San Francisco has tried to outlaw everything from plastic bags to guns to circumcision to McDonald&rsquo;s Happy Meals. They are a Communist government gone berserk.</p>
<p>Mostly this has been leftist whites with the PC quota of blacks, females, Asians, homosexuals, et cetera. </p>
<p>I will love it when the illegal hordes overrun the crazy environmental controls of the Bay Area which since 1970 has sent home prices and rents through the roof.<br>
The lefty libs cannot forever insulate themselves behind ludicrous zoning restrictions a la Marin County.</p>
<p>What needs to happen is to fill in San Francisco Bay entirely with public housing projects and Section 8 housing.</p>
<p>Flatten all the hills in SF, get rid of the cable cars, the Wharf, Chinatown, Pier 39 and all the rest of the junk tourist traps.</p>
<p>Bulldoze Mt. Tamalpais in Marin and start importing folks from Oakland in. Blacks get all window seats on buses and trains as reparations as well as all domestic flights. </p>
<p>Get the BART subway over to Marin, Hillsborough, Piedmont and all the nicer areas so they can experience more diversity.</p>
<p>Make it legal to advertise No White Males Need Apply to jobs, it&rsquo;s already a defacto policy, make it dejure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get moving on compulsory diversity now ! </p>

		<p>I doubt that they will stick around to get what is their due. The poor whites who can not get away will be stuck with the misery. Instead they will move to areas like mine, where they will look down their noses on the local population, (rednecks and hicks) throw their way around to get things done the way they did them where they came from. I have literally met some of those kind of people talking contemptuously about how the locals pronounce the name of certain roads and the lake.  I figure they have been around here and their parents before them and they ought to know how it is said. But no, that liberal, like with everything else, knows it best. I detest these people. </p>

<p>There are many reasons.  These people are not all necessarily self-hating; many  are just greedy and short-sighted. They will do anything for money,  and they are going with the flow, doing what is considered  popular and socially condoned,  and prospering very nicely for now. <br>
 <br>
They certainly do benefit handsomely from their treason. On the other hand, patriotism doesn&rsquo;t pay at all. Patriots are reviled and called racists. They have to worry about their jobs, reputations,  and careers.  There are no promotions to be gotten from patriotism.</p>
<p>The USA has been put on the auction block and is being sold off to all comers.  <b>Selling America has become  a highly  profitable enterprise.  </b> And there are no penalties attached to those who do it.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?   They are like the thoughtless fool who is sawing off the branch that he is sitting on. Either they can&rsquo;t imagine the coming Dark Holocaust, or they think they will be protected as part of the untouchable elite;  or many of them may not even expect to be here when the inevitable reckoning comes. They will grab their money and run to some international haven. </p>
<p>What happens then will be YOUR problem, not theirs. They couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>

<p>I have to  disagree with you on that. At least partially.  You are making it much too simple.  Many of them are self-serving  &#8220;hypocrites&#8221;,  yes.  But there are also many  others who are truly committed, brainwashed Leftists.  These are the zealots, and the worst kind, beyond all reasoning.</p>
<p>In fact, I was thinking the very opposite from you. She could very well be married to a black man&hellip; or to some other non-white &#8220;minority&#8221;. She could be someone like Obama&rsquo;s mother, for instance, a passionately devoted Leftist who repudiated whites. I have known such people and they are motivated by an almost religious conviction which transcends logic or self-interest. To them, (white) racial solidarity is a sin. Indeed, it is a CRIME against humanity&hellip; while support of non-whites is a virtue.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said here before, and I think it&rsquo;s worth saying again, <b>If you find some inexplicably tenacious devotion to another race, it&rsquo;s worth looking the the bedroom.</b>   Very often, the answer lies there.</p>

		<p>Most Asians and Hispanics are beyond being &#8216;non civic-minded&rsquo; and edging towards active hostility towards the environment and public works (parks etc. especially).  Blacks never have been that way.</p>
<p>So what putting a bunch of low-commitment types into municipal planning commissions does is guarantee a whisper-in-ear vote to whatever (corporate or social) plan is against the best interests of the activity in question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never done for no reason people.  It&rsquo;s done to insert corruptible cultures into positions of former power where they can attack anything that might be seen as &#8216;preserving&rsquo; a piece of real estate, wildlife or activity that is not-for-profit based.</p>
<p>To which I will add that Nancy Arvold (towards the bottom)-</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/Dwqyz</p>
<p>Is one of those &#8216;globalism is my religion&rsquo; (UN trained) socialist nuts whose professional competencies are all over the place from marriage counseling to &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; ethnic appeasement yet I see no real signs of managerial skills in her.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Nancy came to the UNtraining in 1997 through a growing frustration at the failure of dialogue between white people and people of color, and her awareness of the obstacles created by her own and other white people&rsquo;s guilt, sensitivity and defensiveness. She believes that racism is the glue that holds the oppression of the world in place and that white people&rsquo;s unconscious racism keeps this system of inequity going.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Sounds like a personality in flight from White Male Power syndrome, looking to make alliances with whatever group she can to elevate her self esteem.  Typical female accommodation personality looking for validation.</p>
<p>Racism may keep the system in place but it hardly is the &#8216;oppression&rsquo; you think it is.<br>

		<p>This situation is not so difficult to explain. The Bay Area counties are a one-party state and a one party-society. The normal operative factor in politics   &mdash;   the electoral coalition between minorities and the minority of the white vote which is liberal    &mdash;   does not exist in the Bay Area. Everyone is a Democrat and minorities have no leverage.</p>
<p>The solution would be for minorities to start voting Republican. That would give them the leverage they have everywhere else but lack in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The fact that the Bay Area is so uniformly Democratic gives the Bay Area huge leverage in state and national politics. Outside of the Bay Area, California itself is divided 50-50, more or less, between the two parties. All four of the highest statewide positions are held by Bay Area Democrats   &mdash;   Gov Brown, Lt Gov. Newsome, Sen. Feinstein and Sen. Boxer.</p>
<p>The Bay Area really is kind of a secret world. The rest of California, even the rest of Northern California, pays little attention to it. Even more so, the rest of America. I have done some marketing work in the Bay Area, and I can tell you, the Bay Area market is widely neglected by many national businesses.</p>
<p>The sum of all of these factors gives the Bay Area&rsquo;s Democrats enormous power within their own party and the ability to set an agenda which is national in its reach.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have it both way. Minorities obviously want the national benefits that come from the Bay Area&rsquo;s political reach, but they do not want to suffer the local consequences. How long people have lived in their local areas has a lot to do with who holds local offices. If an ethnic group has more members who move from one region, or even town or neighborhood within a region, to another, who have lower incomes, or do not own their own residences, this is likely to be reflected in the roster of who holds local offices. Also, first generation immigrants may not even become U.S. citizen during their lifetime. Their children may move to other regions. There are a lot of factors.</p>

<p>Why is cultural diversity always &#8220;rich&#8221;? Why is it never &#8220;poor&#8221;? Who says cultural diversity is &#8220;rich&#8221;? Why so? How come they are never called to task for this? Something isn&rsquo;t so, just because someone says it is so. Is Japan &#8220;culturally poor&#8221; because it has so little diversity? I don&rsquo;t think so. I think it is better off.</p>

		<p>We need to stop caling these people liberals and call them what they are: communists. Up until &#8216;98 Silicon Valley was 98% white American males. All the hippie commies from the bay area couldn&rsquo;t stand it. So they wanted to be sure all the white programmers making lots of $ had their jobs stolen and given to 3rd worlders who never lifted a finger. From each according to his ability to each according to his need. That&rsquo;s communism. Those who work harder and produce more get punished and those who produce zip get more.</p>
<p>Diversity is really just another form of communism - America makes, the world takes.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the economy doing with these 3rd worlders running it now? It was booming back when white Americans were running it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Communism will come to America but it will not be called communism&#8221;<br>

<p>&#8220;Complaining about &ldquo;White privilege&rdquo; is just a weapon that privileged Whites use against the rest of us. They want to defend poor, oppressed blacks from our White privilege, which we don&rsquo;t have, by using their power in positions of authority (White privilege they do have) to block our advancement while promoting non qualified blacks to our jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be doing it for too much longer.  For years they&rsquo;ve been using minorities to create a bulwark against opposition to their agendas but with runaway immigration and an exploding minority population, their &#8220;pets&#8221; won&rsquo;t need them anymore because they&rsquo;ll just take over the operation and they&rsquo;ll turn the tables on them.  Liberal thinking is suicidal but perhaps the whole idea was to accumulate as much wealth and power as they could before the piper had to be paid.  I doubt many of these people have families/children or live normal mainstream lives so why do they need to worry about the future?</p>
