			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Ransom, Townhall, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I&rsquo;m not sorry enough that I&rsquo;m a white man in America, apparently.</p>
<p>But thanks to another professor who works for the Colorado university system- this time in Colorado Springs- I can increase my guilt in a seminar lasting from April 13th through the 16th. And because it&rsquo;s held at the Sheraton in Minneapolis, MN, I can have a mint put on pillow every night as I fall asleep wrapped in guilt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yes, the same state university system that brought us Ward Churchill brings us the 12th Annual White Privilege Conference.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White Privilege, the conference says, is the concept &#8220;that the U.S. was started by white people, for white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.K.&rsquo;s Daily Mail tells us that the conference&rsquo;s founder, Eddie Moore &#8220;wanted&hellip; to teach people of colour: &#8216;That White supremacy, White privilege, racism and other forms of oppression are designed for your destruction  &mdash;  designed to kill you.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course he did.</p>
<p>The conference organizer is Dr. Abby Ferber, the Director of Women&rsquo;s Studies and Co- Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Diversity and Development at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS).</p>
<p>The UCCS says that Dr. Ferber &#8220;is widely recognized as a leading scholar of the far right.&#8221; She has published several works on white supremacists groups and hate crimes.</p>
<p>Of course she has.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ferber told readers of the HuffPost that the shooting was the result of the &#8220;same fundamentalist ideology that has provided the backdrop of previous incidents of domestic, home-grown terrorism, such as the Oklahoma City bombing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Current right-wing fear-mongering about the U.S. moving toward socialism, or tyranny,&#8221; she continued &#8220;have no empirical grounding. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter  &mdash;  all that matters is some people have been convinced this is the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White, male, Christians, it seems, never get blamed for anything in this country, says Ferber. I guess we&rsquo;re all guilty by insanity though.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time we turn that critical lens,&#8221; says Dr. Far Right Wing &#8220;on what passes for mainstream America.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Dr. Ferber.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time we called you what you are: A state-sponsored racist.</p>
<p>Of course you are.</p>

The truth hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it?  Of course they make sure that it is an attack against that concept. AMERICA WAS started BY White people FOR White people, period!  So were the Euro nations! ALL of them!</p>
<p>If Whites had any smarts left they would be saying this 24/7. Call talk shows and keep repeating it. Tell your family and friends also. Go on forums and flood them with that statement over and again. </p>

		<p>Colorado like most states in the Union is suffering budget shortfalls and higher education is getting hit.  But apparently we can still afford a Director of Women&rsquo;s Studies and Co- Assistant Vice Chancellor for Academic Diversity and Development at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS).  I&rsquo;m sure the graduates of her program are incredibly productive young people just like engineering and sciences grads. What the world needs now is another Womens Studies major like I need a hole in my head.   </p>

<p>And what is wrong with that? Of course the founders, all white men, would found a country that is an expression of their culture. What kind of psychopath would start a country designed for another race to occupy? Such foolishness. </p>
<p>We should embrace openly and proudly the fact that the United States was started by white people, for white people&#8221;</p>

		<p>True story - Dr. Abby Ferber was against school busing in the 1970&rsquo;s. I know that from Miss Simon&rsquo;s class. Of course, we were only in the fifth grade then, soaking up white privilege in Beachwood, Ohio.</p>
<p>I do wonder if that might have affected her, given that at the time, the area where we lived was 100% white (no longer true). </p>

		<p>How long is stuff like this going to survive in the current depression?  How long can &#8220;black studies&#8221; survive in universities facing drastic budget cuts?  In both cases, my guess is, not long.  I believe it will be done fairly quietly; one day we&rsquo;ll wake up &amp; realize they&rsquo;ve been gone for a while &amp; no one noticed who wasn&rsquo;t directly involved. </p>

		<p>Well, wasn&rsquo;t it?  I don&rsquo;t see any black faces in the paintings of the signers of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.  It was a different time, and YES, white men did rule at that time.  So what?  They also had the brains and guts to build the greatest nation the current world has ever seen.  No it was NOT built on the backs of black people; black people have never constituted more than 13% of the general population in the US, and Asians, Hispanics and Native Americans comprised even less.  Nope - the vast bulk of the hands-on work was done by WHITE men, for white men.  It&rsquo;s a fact.  I just don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s wrong with it.  Was not China built by Chinese for the Chinese?  Was not Japan built by the Japanese FOR the Japanese?  What is the problem here?  I&rsquo;ll tell you what the problem is.  Blacks want a piece of a pie they did not work for in significant numbers, because they feel white people owe them for the slavery of their ancestors.  No way.  If blacks want to prosper, then they can adopt the values and practices that bring success.  Some have, and they ARE successful.  The vast majority, however, would rather sit on their ample rears, hold their hand out palm up for welfare, and complain about the unfairness of it all.  I say it&rsquo;s high time we quit listening.</p>

		<p>I graduated from this school. If it had been a springboard for  this kind of hateful delusion, I&rsquo;d have dropped out immediately. As it is, I&rsquo;d just as soon omit that I ever stepped foot on the campus, so degraded as it has become.</p>
<p>It was once one of the finest campuses in the country, despite it&rsquo;s small size. <br>
Now just another nest of perverse thought, cynical manipulation and gross corruption.</p>
<p>I call it &#8220;The Diversity Of Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been doing white privilege stuff on this campus for years, they indoctrinate the new students to hate whiteness, maleness, straigtness, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how bad it is. But, hey, tuition costs are up ten times what they were 15 years ago, there&rsquo;s a bit of third- worldish  kids skulking about,  literacy and general intelligence has slipped by the wayside and there&rsquo;s a bunch of spiffy, expensive new buildings. The education is poor. </p>
<p>PROGRESS!</p>

		<p>Some non-whites are sick and tired of this patronizing attitude that treats blacks particularly as if they&rsquo;re all stupid, helpless children.  The problem is that those who are fed up do not speak out often enough, but it seems that they&rsquo;re beginning to do so.  Morgan Freeman recently scoffed at an interviewer&rsquo;s suggestion that blacks are treated badly by Hollywood, and, on MSNBC&rsquo;s &#8220;The Black Agenda&#8221; program, several upper-middle class blacks denied any such agenda and stated that it&rsquo;s the poor who need help.  I know that I, as a hillbilly, would be insulted if someone just assumed that I&rsquo;m backward and uneducated simply because I live in Appalachia.  <br>
Among the mainstream, loony liberals are no more than a laughing stock.  I recently read that Ashley Judd believes gender is a social construct(!)  Well, what&rsquo;s next  &mdash;  one&rsquo;s species?  Silly conferences like this one just make it clearer how goofy these folks are.  Let &#8216;em squawk.</p>

What is a Nation of same people but family grown big. <br>
Those Idiots think the white founders and settlers, who cleared the land, cut the trees, established the farms, built the roads, started little towns that grew into big towns, set up an educational system,etc.,etc. did all that  with the thought of working their fingers to the bone so some foreigners can come and reap the benefits of their efforts. Come on in, here, take it, it&rsquo;s free. After all, that is what this country is, the land of the free. Free education, healthcare, food, for all and sundry. </p>

		<p>Most White people seem to have no idea what is going on, Dr Kevin McDonald and others explain it well, but too few whites will come accross their material.<br>
I think &#8216;realizations&rsquo; need to be put into peoples minds. <br>
I wonder sometimes if a simple thought provoking sticker campaign in main public thoroughfares might spread the message, just some image and a question.</p>
<p>Those newspaper Headlines / articles have a role too, instead of throwing them away after reading, leave them in the car or somewhere where they can be seen by passers by, maybe in a restaurant, this will get brains thinking that might otherwise have missed those articles and headlines.<br>
There is information out there for Whites to evaluate, but they are swamped by leftist propaganda, we need to ensure that the information that helps our cause is not thrown away but recycled.<br>
Let&rsquo;s say that left wing propaganda outnumbers us 10 to 1. if each newspaper headline can be seen by 1000 extra people, the balance can be redressed by making it a general policy for Nationalist to ensure that any helpfull media headlines are recycled&rsquo; in ways such as this.<br>
For those who with good reason do not by mainstream news papers, it might be worth doing so on those occaisions when the headline helps the cause.<br>
How about sitting in a train or bus station with the headline visible to all, in an hour or so, that headline can be seen by thousands.<br>
Cheap, simple and I think a concerted effort like that might well be very effective. <br>

<p>- What moonbat insane cocktail of nonsense passing for neurons swirls around in these peoples&rsquo; heads? What negative things in the the entire planet do White Christian males NOT get blamed for? Not only is a white man blamed for his own personal actions (the only actions he should rationally have to shoulder), he&rsquo;s blamed for a patently false accounting of the history of white men in the past nearly all, if not all, of whom he may never have even been related, he&rsquo;s blamed for the failures of minorities, he&rsquo;s blamed for not having solved problems, and instead of credit for all the enormous benefit that has come to virtually everyone on earth from the disproportionate creativity and productiveness of the white man, he is instead crucified as though it all must have come from some invisible zero-sum privilege stolen from others.</p>
<p><br>

		<p>So they want to tell us not only that this country wasn&rsquo;t founded by whites, but that it wasn&rsquo;t founded by whites.</p>
<p>So which is true - This country was founded by a benevolent non-white race FOR whites or that it was founded by whites who wanted non-whites to run it?</p>
<p>When is someone going to start hosting an &#8220;anti-white study&#8221; seminar to examine these types of views - most often, interestingly enough, held by whites - often from the upper class of society.  </p>
<p>Oddly enough poor whites are too busy eeking out a living to take advantage of &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.</p>

Those &#8220;few&#8221; will never change the black behaviors and attitudes or genetics. They won&rsquo;t change a darn thing in this country or in their race.</p>
<p>There is always an excuse for these people, such as,&#8221; they do not speak out often enough&#8221; blah blah. Maybe because your assumptions are wrong to begin with. </p>

<p>Actually, some say it is the liberal white american most likely to hold this view. They constantly pamper and patronize minorities and their experience and this makes them subconsciously at the very least feel superior to them. Steven Sailor also points out they don&rsquo;t really believe these minorities, they are bending over backwards to support, will take THEIR job.</p>

		<p>Dutchman&rsquo;s Grand Slam Home run with all Bases loaded with White baseball players: </p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the founders, all white men, would found a country that is an expression of their culture. What kind of psychopath would start a country designed for another race to occupy? Such foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dang, Dutch!   I wish I had wrote that comment.  It was absolutely BRILLIANT! This needs to be turned into a bumper sticker, pal!  </p>
<p>And, it ties into what I&rsquo;ve said here before:  Whites are the Owners of America.   Our 100 percent White ancestors settled this rugged and harsh territory and  they shed their sweat, blood and tears in order to tame it. Those white settlers and frontiersmen did ferocious battle with the various Indian tribes - just as the Indian tribes also did equally ferocious battle with one another, and when the dust settled, White men were victorious. </p>
<p>News Flash:  Whites should stop apologizing for our victorious ancestors and instead, take pride in their struggles, sacrifices and great achievements.    We owe them that level of respect.  </p>
<p>On a personal note:  I once took a vacation to the West and decided to visit Grafton, Utah - a little, largely historic town that happened to be the location where the opening scenes of the movie &#8220;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#8221; were filmed.  On the road up to where the town was located, my friend and I spotted a small cemetery along side the dusty road.   We stopped, and decided to walk through the cemetery and examine some of the markers and gravestones.   I will never forget this experience, because of the incredible number of gravestones that listed the names of the settlers to that area - and the fact that a sizable number of those graves were the final resting places of children, many under the age of 10.  Under their birth date and death dates appeared various short descriptions of the circumstances that lead to their deaths, as was the custom in those days.  </p>
<p>Many of those descriptions revealed that those small, white children had been killed by Indians during Indian attacks.  </p>
<p>A message to my fellow White brothers and sisters:   Imagine the grief that those parents must have felt, if they managed to survive those Indian attacks and had to help bury their children.  Those are the kind of sacrifices that our ancestors endured in order for us to be able to be born in the nation that they built.     </p>
<p>Those sacrifices are also the proof that Whites are the legitimate and justified owners of this nation, and all these anti-white, venom spewing Cultural Marxist elitists and the hordes of third world aliens that they have maliciously imported against the wishes of, and in direct contradiction to the legitimate ethnic interests of, the White European majority and founding stock of this nation - these enemies are not so stupid as to not understand this truth.     These Cultural Marxists are diabolically evil and their ultimate agenda is the genocide of the White race and the total destruction of White, Western Civilization.</p>
<p>We owe it to our ancestors to stop apologizing for being white and to fight tooth and nail to defend our rightful inheritance, i.e., America.     Do not let these race hustlers and nation thieves intimidate us into surrendering OUR NATION.   </p>

		<p>My question is:  Why do the taxpayers feel obliged to pay for this toxic ideology?  Meanwhile, pro-European and Christian worldviews are suppressed at most public colleges.  It was once predicted by a certain Soviet leader that the West would sell them the ropes we would be hanged with.  Now it isn&rsquo;t even a sale; we give the rope and gallows away, dutifully place our collective necks in, confess our &#8220;sins&#8221; to the multikulti and hang ourselves.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t the pro-europeans disrupting these conferences?</p>

		<p>Our British ancestors founded this country in order to &#8220;&hellip;secure the blessings of liberty TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The descendants of the founding stock Americans should be the first to reap the hard earned benefits of 400 years and over 12 generations of the dedicated labor of their forebears - NOT alien hostiles and their hostile enablers. </p>
<p>We have a right to be ourselves in our own land, and we have a right to rule ourselves in our own land. If our leaders fail to serve in our best interest they our no longer OUR leaders, but someone else&rsquo;s. </p>

<p>&hellip;..would only be just, compared to the antics the fascistic &#8216;antifas&rsquo; did for both David Duke, David Irving, and AmRen&rsquo;s past conferences, where THEIR HOTELS were the victims of BOMBING, DEATH THREATS, and COERSION.</p>
<p>Two can play at that game. I only wonder how long it will be, before some &#8216;antifa&rsquo; does a &#8220;King David&#8221; hotel ploy on American soil&hellip;..</p>

&#8220;And, it ties into what I&rsquo;ve said here before: Whites are the Owners of America. Our 100 percent White ancestors settled this rugged and harsh territory and they shed their sweat, blood and tears in order to tame it. Those white settlers and frontiersmen did ferocious battle with the various Indian tribes - just as the Indian tribes also did equally ferocious battle with one another, and when the dust settled, White men were victorious&#8221;.<br>

 BINGO! WE need to teach our children and grandchildren these TRUTHS!<br>

&#8220;We owe it to our ancestors to stop apologizing for being white and to fight tooth and nail to defend our rightful inheritance, i.e., America. Do not let these race hustlers and nation thieves intimidate us into surrendering OUR NATION.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
BINGO, again! And WE need to flood these neocons talk radio shows with these truths and specifically ask Mark Levin WHY he never mentions this FACT,(then he will abruptly hang us and call us every name in the book)&hellip;But then we could at least EXPOSE him for his lies.</p>
<p> The neocons are even worse than the liberals, at least we KNOW who and what the liberals are, but to mislead DELIBERATELY the White listeners by claiming this nation was founded for ALL peoples and ALL immigrants is the biggest lie of them all. They are too AFRAID to even tell the TRUTH!  So we need to tell the TRUTH for them!</p>

<p>&#8220;News Flash: Whites should stop apologizing for our victorious ancestors and instead, take pride in their struggles, sacrifices and great achievements. We owe them that level of respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very well said, Sir.  I&rsquo;m quite certain folks like my Grandfather felt this way, as do I.  But, then again, he was the guy who did the struggling and sacrificing.  For ME!  His line!  His BLOOD!  I won&rsquo;t let him down by bowing to anyone who has the gall to call me and my kind guilty!  </p>
<p>AND, my Grandfather&rsquo;s generation of also saved the entire PLANET from a tyranny and evil that liberal knotheads could never wrap their feeble minds around.   </p>
<p>These are FACTS.  These facts must never be distorted.  It is our duty to preserve these facts and shout them daily.  If we do, our heritage that our white fathers earned for us can never be stolen.   </p>

		<p>My mom used to have a saying whenever I said something particularly outlandish as a child: &#8216;Missouri Proof&rsquo;.  She being a proud native of The Show Me State.</p>
<p>A thousand words of diatribe back and forth only leaves the ignorant white audience confused, disgusted or frightened by the vituperousness and implied evil of the racial debating parties discussing openly a &#8216;forbidden&rsquo; topic</p>
<p>And therefore more apt to retreat to the -comfort- of their anonymous, helpless, material lives.</p>
<p>Where at least the enemy is a constant monthly bill, living on less while paying more for, the basics of a decent existence.</p>
<p>OTOH, you give those whites something to look at which is similarly physical, permanent and _successful_.  Something which is both familiar, ferocious and yet neutral in it&rsquo;s &#8216;for us alone, we bear no one else ill will&rsquo; white nationalist presentation of that success; without following any of the leftist assumptions of naziism, racism, or other &#8216;genocidal intent&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And suddenly they will wake up.</p>
<p>Suddenly they will have their Missouri Proof.</p>
<p>We have lost the will to be spiritual in our belief in our owned destinies because we have been taught that nation as people is not a divine task whose -side benefit- is material wealth.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be evil to be comfortable living as a white enjoying your ancestors&rsquo; legacy to you.  You don&rsquo;t have to be anything but hard working and proud to give that legacy as your children&rsquo;s chance at success, another generational push forwards.</p>
<p>But you do have to be white.  Because history shows that no one else does it better.</p>
<p>And you have to want to stay that way.  As a heritage of culture, as a potential of genes, as a community of identity and future purpose.</p>
<p>Right now, we are so undermined by our own elites creating a thousand little brushfires in the hopes of routing us into an acceptance of foreign racial overrun that there is really only one option remaining for us:  Create a here and no further border line.  And a light a counter burn.  Taking out the bridges of vulnerability and forced mutualism by which we are tied to a society already on fire.</p>
<p>So that, separately, we can move on.  And the grand social experiment that the rest of the U.S. has set it&rsquo;s hopes upon, can have it&rsquo;s success or failure without the destruction of the founder culture who gave it it&rsquo;s first push in the right direction.</p>
<p>Only to see it change course to&hellip;this.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;White Privilege, the conference says, is the concept &ldquo;that the U.S. was started by white people, for white people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is not a concept, it is a straight-up fact. The United States was a White country that was built by Whites for themselves and their White children, grandchildren and future descendents. Too bad that we in these later generations have allowed in a horde of incompatible foreigners from every pestilential hellhole of the globe who have no common identity, language or culture with us (or with each other for that matter.) They have no desire to assimilate into our culture, only to take over. </p>

		<p>In the week following the White Privilege conference, a black newspaper in Minnesota, the Spokesman-Recorder, published my letter to the editor critical of the conference.  It was titled &#8220;&#8216;White Privilege&rsquo; an expression of White self-hatred.&#8221;  If interested, you can read the letter in a longer article posted at https://www.billmcgaughey.com/whiteprivilege.html.</p>
