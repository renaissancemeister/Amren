			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DeWayne Wickham, USA Today, April 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poor in urban America, he [Obama] said in that 2007 speech, &#8220;suffer most from a politics that has been tipped in favor of those with the most money, and influence, and power.&#8221; And then he asked rhetorically, &#8220;How can a country like this allow it?&#8221; To which he answered, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>But so far, under his leadership, he <em>has</em> allowed it.</p>
<p>Finding work for the jobless is the best anti-poverty program this nation can mount. But while the Obama administration spends $608 million during the first 17 days of its involvement in Libya&rsquo;s civil war  &mdash;  it can muster neither the money nor the will to combat black unemployment.</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s failure to fight this problem as vigorously as he wages war abroad gets a pass from black leaders, many of whom complain to me privately but remain silent in public. They&rsquo;re reluctant to challenge Obama the way Martin Luther King Jr. did Lyndon Johnson in 1967.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last month, as the Obama administration applauded the creation of 216,000 new jobs and a slight dip in the overall unemployment rate, the gap between whites and blacks without work widened as the black unemployment rate inched up.</p>
<p>In December 2009, when the black unemployment rate was just 5.5 percentage points higher than the national rate, Obama told USA TODAY that he didn&rsquo;t think he needed to do anything special to close this gap. Now that it is nearly 7 percentage points higher, black leaders should demand that the president devote as much attention on this problem as he has on ending the military&rsquo;s &#8220;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; policy and in pushing for immigration reform.</p>
<p>They should demand an end to the wasteful spending on wars that can&rsquo;t be won and insist that the resulting peace dividend be used to finance that revitalized urban policy  &mdash;  the one Obama not so long ago promised would be the focus of his economic agenda.</p>

		<p>Where have this guy been?  This country has already spent billions and still counting on affirmative action, welfare, Head Start, Race to the Top, etc. etc.  Instead of progressing, blacks are actually regressing.  We could spend billions more and the blacks would still be no better.  Ever heard of differences in quality of genes?  Perhaps, this guy if he really cares about his people, he should be writing about selective breeding among the blacks, e.g., only the brightest black genes should reproduce.  But then, that would end the free racial shakedowns.</p>

		<p>The real problem is that blacks have been so coddled with welfare programs that they simply do not want to try to find work. If they do find a job suddenly all their welfare is cut off and they have to pay rent, buy food and pay for medical care out of their pocket. Unfortunately most of the black underclass are unqualified for jobs that will provide much more than minimum wage- the ones that manage to graduate with affirmative action degrees are virtually guaranteed diversity &#8220;make busy&#8221; jobs. </p>

		<p>So, the black race is upset because Obama didn&rsquo;t run all the white people away from the good jobs so they could take over&hellip;that&rsquo;s how I read this article.  I&rsquo;ve heard more black people complain about how Obama wasn&rsquo;t treating them right, and they voted for him because they thought he would run whitey out of town.  Too bad.  I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else, but I got a job and became successful and prosperous by my own merits, not because I sat back and waited for someone to come by and kiss my rear and give me a job.  This topic is irrelevant - blacks have no work ethics or integrity enough to achieve their own success.</p>

		<p>This article reminds me of a great saying someone said on here a while back.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Meteor hits the earth and everyone dies, blacks suffer the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do these people not realize that substantially more blacks have serious criminal records and less useable college degrees?  Could the fact that Detroit has almost a 50% illiteracy rate (not including the residents in prison and the homeless.  Then it would be closer to 60%)?</p>
<p>Blacks are hired less because they are less qualified.  Explain white privilege to blacks when compared to East Asians.</p>

		<p>Only a demented, perpetually childlike mind could reach adulthood and think that it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s responsibility to get one a job.   All the good intentions in the World won&rsquo;t get chronically unemployed blacks working if they either 1) don&rsquo;t really want to work or 2) want to work but not too hard nor when they don&rsquo;t want to or 3) don&rsquo;t like working for someone who expects them to be able to dress, behave, read, write, &amp; speak like an adult should or 4) don&rsquo;t want to have to be polite to white people. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not easy finding a job and a good one at that but I&rsquo;m under the impression that there is a high unemployment (up to 50% and more) among certain groups because they just don&rsquo;t want a job. </p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get it do you, Mr. Wickham?  </p>
<p>Your people have been thrown under the proverbial bus along with 0bama&rsquo;s White grandmother.  Blacks have been cast aside in favor of the new, favorite aggrieved &#8220;minority&#8221;,  one that has already surpassed you in numbers   &mdash;   and, most importantly, soon in voting numbers.  An aggrieved &#8220;minority&#8221;  that YOUR OWN politicians encourage to enter the US to ethnically cleanse and displace YOU in your neighborhoods and the job market.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles black numbers have fallen by half.</p>
<p>While you were busy looking for The Great White Bigot and demanding &#8220;rights&#8221; and government handouts, your own CBC was busy pushing amnestia   &mdash;   you see they are courting the Hispanic vote just like 0bama, knowing full well you would not deign to vote for a White or Republican.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t been paying attention!  While your pols tell you your worst enemy is White America, right in front of your face they were working mightily to displace you.</p>
<p>Want some proof? I&rsquo;ve done your homework for you (and not for the first time).  You&rsquo;d better heed the following, 0bama&rsquo;s is pushing again for amnesty and recently hosted a summit with a very select group of 70 pro-amnesty supporters <b>including Al Sharpton.</b></p>
<p><i>Only days after launching his 2012 re-election bid, President Obama revived the issue of immigration reform with a meeting at the White House last Tuesday. &hellip;the President&hellip;neither invited any Members of Congress nor law enforcement representatives, or governors of border states</i></p>
<p><i>Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-RACE).. warned that the President needs to &ldquo;shore up his support among the Latino community&rdquo; in the coming months&hellip;Sources inside the meeting indicate the President is willing to do just that. Obama indicated he would press for a vote on a bill to help certain   undocumented immigrants attain legal status</i></p>
<p><i>This latest meeting of the President&rsquo;s was scheduled just prior to Obama&rsquo;s fundraising stops in Nevada and California, two heavily Latino-populated states.</i></p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying, Mr. Wickham?  </p>
<p>You are in the same position we Whites are as 0bama panders to Amerika&rsquo;s new Most Favored Victim Class: You are  irrelevant!    Welcome to our world!  We were thrown under the bus a long time ago, 40 years ago, long before 0bama took office.</p>

		<p>Actually,</p>
<p>I think Mr. Wickham is wrong for the simple reason that -he- sees the world through racial lenses.</p>
<p>Any politician worth his salt shakes hands with the voting polity who is the majority he is &#8216;trying to please&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Like it or lump it, whites still for 60 odd percent of this nation.  Doing something simple like declaring the stabilization phases of Iraq and AfG _over_ and bringing our troops home from needless stays in decades-long pacified areas like Korean and Europe would be a great way to wake whites (democrats at least) up to the reality that he is &#8216;with&rsquo; their agenda at least.</p>
<p>Putting the kaibosh on a 380 billion dollar (1 trillion with support costs) F-35 JSF that was first mooted in 1994 and will not see service until 2020 when it will be nominally inferior to both the Pak-FA and the J-20 would also be a big budget saver.</p>
<p>We can win Libyan wars with UCAVs and a _standardized_ fleet purchase of the 58 million dollar F/A-18E/F.  Going up against anything else will require a great deal more firepower and planning, particularly as China is a coastal state with both nuclear weapons and ASBM delivery systems for them.</p>
<p>This might induce a conservative to also constrain funds for the followon Ford class carriers and give some type of thought to upgrades for the Nimitz before shifting to a smaller vessel in a followon class (40 jets on a 100,000 ton super carrier is a _disgrace_).</p>
<p>These savings alone, while having high amortization (shut down) costs, would likely save the U.S. the better part of 2-3 trillion dollars in the next decade.  They would also facilitate the drawdown of one of the three maneuver divisions with the remaining mix and match brigade structures being assignable to the Southern Border, in rotation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&rsquo;s every first term president want?&#8221;  A second term.</p>
<p>It all depends on whether Obama is willing to break the leash of his designated &#8216;ride him into the ground&rsquo; minders enough to get that second term.  After all, promises are cheap.</p>

		<p>What I find interesting about this sort of argument is that there is the assumption that it is up to the government to &#8220;do something.&#8221;  But why can&rsquo;t this fellow encourage blacks to be entrepreneurs? Or successful blacks invest in the inner cities? </p>
<p><i>Yet, everyday, Hispanics sneak across our border and find jobs. Without a government program or a word of English they manage to get jobs.</i></p>
<p>Good point. </p>
<p>Another good point is that if blacks feel they are being displaced in the economic feeding chain, then they need to look at how their leaders have sold out on the illegal immigration issue. </p>
