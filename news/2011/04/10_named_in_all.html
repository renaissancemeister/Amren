			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Perry, Los Angeles Times, April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten people have been named as part of an attempted conspiracy to bribe players to fix basketball games at the University of San Diego and UC Riverside, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Monday in San Diego.</p>
<p>Among the 10 are former University of San Diego assistant coach Thaddeus Brown, 32, and former players Brandon Dowdy, 22, and Brandon Johnson, 24. Johnson is the school&rsquo;s all-time leading scorer and assist maker. He played briefly for the Dakota Wizards in an NBA instructional league.</p>
<p>The allegedly fixed games occurred in 2010 and 2011, prosecutors said. U.S. Atty. Laura Duffy declined to say how many games prosecutors believe were fixed or whether the outcomes were influenced by the alleged bribes to players.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The investigation, dubbed Hook Shot, began a year ago as an outgrowth of a drug investigation, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Keith Slotter, adding that the gamblers were also charged with distributing marijuana.</p>
<p>Johnson was arrested in Houston on Friday and will be arraigned there. Other defendants were arrested in San Diego and will be arraigned in federal court Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brown was an assistant coach in 2006-07 and had left the university before the alleged bribe attempts mentioned in the indictment. Dowdy played at the University of San Diego in the 2006-07 season and then transferred to UC Riverside, where he played from 2008 to 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the arrests were made without incident. Steve Warda Goria, 32, one of three alleged masterminds of the bribery and drug distribution scheme, surrendered at his home in Chula Vista after a two-hour standoff with SWAT officers.</p>

		<p>Why is it that almost all the athletes and ex-athletes involved in point fixing or point shaving scandals are black?  I think all five of the Arizona State basketball players who were heavy into the famous point shaving scandal in the mid-1990s there were black.</p>

		<p>The white weenies will learn nothing from a hundred examples such as this, involving black miscreants.  Their do-gooder weaknesses are disgusting examples of white stupidity and gullibility.</p>
<p>And what do the fools say in response to charges that their weaknesses have cause untold hardships and deaths for whites for centuries?  Well, they actually brag about whites being more altruistic than other races.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they&rsquo;re a minority and very likely one day they could well be pretty much aced out of the picture altogether.  I know I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in their shoes when the baloon goes up.</p>

<p>Unsealed Indictment-<br>

<p>College sports are rigged.  Who woulda thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Twice as many teams and conferences, half as much oversight and restrictions, half the overall competence density and seasoning in the teams= wildly randomizable (hideable) statistical variables which can benefit gambled outcomes.  Not to mention young players who are young and without the certainty of a multi million dollar contract to keep them on the straight and narrow as pros are constantly &#8216;remember what you stand to lose&rsquo; aware of.</p>
<p>The real sadness being that these are games which were invented to test and hone a sense of reward from team work and channel aggressive initiative within a strict code of honorable sportsmanship _for whites_.</p>
<p>And are now a venue only for black/hispanic physical athleticism as we wonder why everything from injury lists to point spreads to &#8216;personality&rsquo; issues on individual ethnic high scorers are subject to statistical manipulations which invite &#8216;gaming the system&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rather than playing the game.</p>
<p>It used to be a young man who was on the edge of financial capability to attend college got an athletic scholarship so that he could _be somebody_ by translating his native physical skills into a way off the farm or the docks or out of the steel mill.<br>
His presence on a sports team was a kind of probationary period, during which his actions as a gentleman athlete would define his ability to continue at school and be accepted to a higher position in life.</p>
<p>What we got to see was his struggle, not just to hone his physical skills but to display of the discipline and honor inherent to the struggle to be a part of the team and merge his personal goals with the limits of human endurance and dedication to represent his school.  Making every student and faculty member a part of his effort as their ambassador.</p>
<p>His reward was a better life from a real degree and the social networking to make use of it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, spoiled little creeps and cretins I wouldn&rsquo;t let wax the floors at a higher institution of learning are enrolled solely to give them the -appearance- of respectability sufficient to move them further up the line into pro-sports.</p>
<p>Which is itself a waste of a human life, spent entertaining fat old white men who cannot play themselves and yet encourage other ethnies to remain forever children by paying them outrageous sums beyond any -possible- value in what they do as surrogates for their ego.</p>
<p>More than astronauts, more than brain surgeons or engineers, more than the leaders of this nation.  It is disgusting.</p>
<p>Any notion that sports honed a body and a brain to participate in society as a human being, not &#8216;a playuh&rsquo;, ended when blacks and hispanics entered white sports with nothing but their overdeveloped bodies to offer up.</p>
<p>In a post-diversity America, where &#8216;RAIV&rsquo; (race as an independent variable) is NOT worshiped as closeted envy of black athletic skills, maybe we could return to playing as we once did, for the reasons we once did.</p>
<p>But until then, I have no interest in the realities of sporting politics as a gambling science.  Because the crime is not in the fixing of games.  It&rsquo;s in the existence of college sports corruption as a primer for professional sports depravity.</p>

<p>Further than that, until not so long ago, in both football and basketball, scholarship athletes were redshirted for their Freshman year.  That rule was in place to give him a greater chance actually to graduate, five academic years in which to take and pass enough courses to graduate.  And it was a test of his academic abilities and character, to see if he was college material at all, or just was able to &#8220;slip in&#8221; to college based on some fake transcript.  All the while, the head coach didn&rsquo;t have to waste a roster spot on him.  If he didn&rsquo;t pan out in class, then he was gone, nothing ventured, nothing gained.  On top of all that, it meant that seniors on the team were fifth year students, around 22-23 years old, and the level of play was much better.</p>
