<h1>Islamist Leader Threatens of Waging Jihad</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Weekly Blitz (Dhaka, Bangladesh), April 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Notorious pro-Taliban Islamist clergy in Bangladesh, Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini has threatened to wage jihad in the country if the government will pass any law banning child marriage.</p>
<p>He said, two hundred thousand Jihadists of his group are ready to &#8216;sacrifice&rsquo; lives if any such law, which goes against &#8220;Koran and Sunnah&#8221; will be passed by the current government in the country.</p>
<p>Mufti Amini said, &#8220;Banning child marriage will cause challenging the marriage of the holy prophet of Islam, who also married minor Ayesha, when she was just eight years old&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;The new law initiated by the current government will put the moral character of the prophet into controversy and challenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fazlul Haque Amini further said, &#8220;Islam permits child marriage and it will not be tolerated if any ruler will ever try to touch this issue in the name of giving more rights to women.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may be mentioned here that, current government in Bangladesh has taken several measures in ensuring better rights to the women thus treating child marriage as severe offense. It also recommends equal distribution of properties amongst male and female inherits. In contrary, Islamic Sharia law gives lesser rights to women as far as inheritance is concerned. It also allows men to marry any infant girl child. It may be mentioned here that, such law is prevalent in most of the Islamic republics, while in Iran, even forceful sexual relations with the married infant is allowed. A large segment of Muslim scholars and secularist individuals term this as mere perversion.</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, especially in the rural areas, child marriage is very regular phenomenon, where hundreds of child mothers die due to lack of medical facilities as well as for pre-mature pregnancy. There are even cases of deaths of child wives being virtually raped by their husbands. Child marriage is prevalent in rural Bangladesh both amongst the Muslim and non-Muslim families.</p>
<p>Several weeks back, Islamist clergy Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini and Moulana Rezaul Karim launched a movement of &#8216;combating anti-Islam actions&rsquo; by the government in Bangladesh. Since then, hundreds and thousands of followers of these fanatic leaders are active in various forms of demonstrations around the country. It is also reported in media that, minor boys in the Koranic Madrassas were forced join most of the anti-government demonstrations of these leaders. According to unofficial statistics, there are roughly 9 million students attending various madrassas in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Mutfti Fazlul Haque Amini is branded as a &#8216;political tout&rsquo; in Bangladesh, who is virtually making millions by selling Jihadist notion amongst the people. He is under payroll of various Islamist groups including Pakistani intelligence agency ISI. Amini maintains closer ties with Al-Qaeda, Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, Lashkar-e-Toiba and militant outfits inside Kashmir. He also is actively involved in recruiting local youths for participating in &#8216;Jihad&rsquo; in Kashmir, Palestine and other places in the world.</p>
<p>Both Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini and Moulana Rezaul Karim are known for their extreme opinion against United States, Israel and the West. They also patronize various activities against these nations, as well as provide support and logistics to anti-Semitic forces in Bangladesh.<br>

		<p>Child marriage, huh?  The Muslim fundamentalists incessantly gripe that us Westerners &#8220;insult Islam&#8221;, but really; when a bunch of Muslim men claim to be willing to &#8220;sacrifice their lives&#8221; for their &#8220;right&#8221; to rape little girls, it is clearly not the West that is doing the insulting.</p>
<p>Aside from the serious medical down-sides, like hips so narrow that Cesarian section delivery is needed to save the mother, and appalling injuries from sex irrespective of pregnancy, there are probably a few up-sides:</p>
<p>Instead of having to shell out money for a car or motorbike, your &#8220;wife&#8221; will be satisfied with a Barbie doll, and instead of the normal family quarrels about running the household, you&rsquo;d only have to scold her for running on the stairs.  Not much companionship there, though; no thanks!</p>
<p>If Amini and his followers are serious about &#8220;sacrificing their lives&#8221;, I hope the Bangladeshi army and police give them every facility.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Child marriage&#8221; = paedophilia. The &#8220;prophet&#8221; Mohammed - a mentally sick sexual deviant - was a paedophile. He just invented the fraud of Islam as a cover for his greed, cruelty and degeneracy. </p>

		<p><i>Mufti Amini said, &ldquo;Banning child marriage will cause challenging the marriage of the holy prophet of Islam, who also married minor Ayesha, when she was just eight years old&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>The marriage age of Ayesha, (8 years old instead of 6 years old, according to this mufti), appears to be presenting perpetual embarrassment to contemporary Muslims, so much so that true to character, they&rsquo;re ready to play the old takiyya trick as ever here too.</p>
