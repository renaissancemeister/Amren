<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[City councilman Charles] Barron, a Brooklyn councilman not known for subtlety, recently accused Obama of being a &#8220;mouthpiece for a racist, imperialistic American foreign policy controlled by generals and corporate elites.&#8221; He was referring of course to the bombing of Libya, which he says is about &#8220;oil and power, not saving people. It&rsquo;s about maximizing profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barron also accused the president of attending a $30,000 a plate fundraiser in Harlem without actually talking with any regular folks. &#8220;This was the president&rsquo;s first visit to Harlem since he was elected,&#8221; Barron wrote. &#8220;Shame on him!&#8221; </p>
<p>Barron also said, &#8220;Black people did not vote for Barack Obama for him to bomb an African country, Libya. They elected him to stand up like a man against the forces of imperialism. They voted for him to bail out Harlem, where there is 50 percent Black male unemployment, like they bailed out Wall Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your first visit to Harlem since being elected is for a bourgeois fundraiser for the Democratic Party and you don&rsquo;t even have the courtesy to walk the streets of Harlem to meet the masses who put you in office. I hope Black people remember this when [Obama] comes back seeking our vote again.&#8221;</p>

								<h2>America&rsquo;s Oil War on Libya</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Charles Barron, Black Star News, April 2, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>President Barack Obama, a man of African descent, bombing an African Country, Libya, killing innocent African people under the false pretense of stopping President Muammar al-Kaddafi from killing his own people, is unconscionable and unacceptable.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be very clear, President Obama is merely a mouthpiece for a racist imperialistic American foreign policy controlled by generals and corporate elites. The over 162 tomahawk missiles fired from American ships killed more innocent Libyan people than the Civil War between Kaddafi and the so-called rebels killed. By the way, it costs American tax payers over 1 million dollars per missile   &mdash;  over $162 million  &mdash;   and over $600,000 to launch each missile. </p>
<p>The Black community can use that money to respond to the myriad of economic issues that plague our communities.</p>
<p>President Obama had the audacity to come to Harlem last Monday for a $30,000-a-plate fundraiser and not meet with the people of Harlem and address their pressing issues. Harlem&rsquo;s median income is about $30,000 and Harlem&rsquo;s poverty rate is about 30%  &mdash;  and this was the president&rsquo;s first trip to Harlem since being elected. Shame on him!</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The real deal is that America wants to control Africa&rsquo;s oil supply. Obama says that he is only in the war for a &#8220;limited amount&#8221; of time. He says the war is now turned over to NATO. </p>
<p>Mr. President we are not stupid  &mdash;  NATO is run and controlled by America. In fact, NATO is America and we all know that the president and his European coalition are really out for regime change, even if it means killing President Muammar Al-Kaddafi. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Who really thinks America is concerned about African people dying in Africa? They don&rsquo;t care about Black people dying in America. Remember New Orleans. Remember the M.O.V.E bombing in Philadelphia. Remember Sean Bell, 50 bullets. Remember Amadou Diallo, 41 bullets. Remember Timothy Stansbury, a bullet to the heart  &mdash;  all by the New York Police Department (NYPD), and countless others.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get real. This is about oil and power, not saving people. It&rsquo;s about maximizing profits.</p>

		<p>I actually think Libya is a lame attempt on Obama&rsquo;s part to throw something against the wall to see if it sticks, just to give himself a military and/or foreign policy victory in advance of 2012.  That and the cynic in me thinks that he wants to hasten the transfer of control in Libya to AQ or AQ-aligned forces.</p>

<p>Blacks voted for Obama for three reasons: 1) He&rsquo;s black. 2) They expected a big pay off 3) They expected him to take down the white man.</p>
<p>Although blacks are privately frustrated their dreams haven&rsquo;t been realized, they will still vote for him for the number one reason; he&rsquo;s black.<br>

		<p>Sorry Charles, Libyans aren&rsquo;t black.  Just as Egyptians aren&rsquo;t black.  Just as Moroccans aren&rsquo;t black.  I don&rsquo;t believe that we should be getting involved in an Islamic country&rsquo;s civil war, but his assertion that we are there to steal their oil is laughable.  It&rsquo;s just the same line that the leftists always use.  I&rsquo;m still waiting for all of that Iraqi oil that the US &#8220;stole&#8221; according to the libs.  </p>

		<p>More of the inability to think on any abstract level at all.<br>
Nothing but a rambling narrative of victimization Ghadaffi uses black African Mercinaries to kill North Africans,<br>
Sean Bell was killed by..black cops, M.O.V.E were black fanatics<br>
destroying a black neighborhood, Katrina Riots were blacks <br>
destroying a Chocolate city, but this moron turns this somehow into a tale of evil Whitey America. If you what happens<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve commented MANY times about the fact that black&rsquo;s disregard anything and everybody except that which has to do with their own race, which includes blacks the world over.  Race is first, last, and always with the vast, vast majority of these people.</p>
<p>Nothing illustrates this point better than what the black fool above has to say.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing for whites is that this same black attitude is rife among black appointments to this black biased administration. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard MOVE described as the black Waco.  I partly agree and partly disagree.  But MOVE members had a bizarre aversion to using soap and deodorant, thinking they were some sort of weird white racist conspiracy.  If that was their thing, then the cops should have left them alone as much as possible   &mdash;   Just their stench would have automatically meant there would have been ample space between their membership and actual civilization.</p>

		<p>Charles Barron is one of the most racist people in this country.  Has Sharpton beat by a mile. The CONservative Sean Hannity is having a debate with Sharpton.  If he was a real man he wouldn&rsquo;t appear on the same stage with Sharpton.  Except maybe to really take him on, which he never does when Sharpton is a guest on his tv show.  Treats him very well.  As does the other phony, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.  And Hannity never takes Barron on when he&rsquo;s on the show.</p>

		<p>God, blacks never stop whining! They are NEVER satisified.  If Obama wasn&rsquo;t elected, they&rsquo;d scream racism, burn down the city, and beat and kill every white person they saw.</p>
<p>However, now that he was elected, he is being &#8216;set up by the white man to fail.&rsquo;  </p>

		<p>When I read it at first, it seemed like standard professionally-black claptrap about how whitey (or in this case, the white half of Pres. Obama), is keepin&rsquo; Africans down. But then my mind wandered back to such incidents as the Guam capsizing crisis and the reservoir that was mistaken for the &#8220;Specific Ocean&#8221;. It is sadly quite plausible that Councilman Barron believes the denizens of Libya to be black, because the country is in Africa.</p>

<p>The first MOVE against MOVE by the Philly police was in response to a dead baby being exposed and left outside to the elements in plain sight. Disposal by nature so to speak. NO ONE was ever able to determine exactly what MOVE was anyhow!</p>
<p>Delbert Africa after shooting and killing a Philly policeman and wounding at the same time four fire fighters, came out strutting to surrender, doing a dance, and exclaiming, &#8220;OK, I give up, give me my human rights!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>For those unfamiliar, Barron is easily the most hate-filled, anti-white bigot in elected office today! His uninterrupted history of black-chauvanism is the stuff on legend, even in New York. Of course, it could only be a place like NYC where someone could get away with the things Barron does.</p>
<p>If ever one wanted to present the quintessential example of the double-standards of race and politics in the US, look no further than Charles Barron - bigot par excellance! </p>

		<p>On some things, the man&rsquo;s right. Of course we&rsquo;re in Libya to steal their oil. There&rsquo;s a ship with one million barrels leaving rebel-held territory today. Under the guise of fighting for freedom (as always) the corporations use (mostly White) taxpayer money to get a better deal. </p>

		<p>I have to laugh at this, I worked in LIbya in 2009 and 2010. There were hundreds of thousands of Sub-Saharan Africans there, they&rsquo;d come from their own countries looking for work. The Libyans held them in contempt, just as they do Egyptians, Tunisians, Algerians, etc, etc. </p>
<p>When I first got there I was going to a job, we drove under an overpass and there were hundreds of black men sitting around. I asked my driver what they were doing. He replied &#8220;You know how in America you have Mexicans hanging out at Home Depot, waiting for day work?&#8221;, and I replied that I did. He said &#8220;Same deal, they&rsquo;re OUR Mexicans&#8221;. </p>
<p>One of my drivers referred to himself as a &#8220;White African&#8221;, didn&rsquo;t have any use for blacks at all, most Arabs don&rsquo;t. There is even a great deal of distaste for African Muslims, even they are barely tolerated.</p>
<p>The little known, dirty little secret is that the North African Arabs enslaved Africans a few hundred years before the first of us palefaces showed up on the scene. There are roads from Sub-Saharan Africa that exist today that were slave roads, bringing African slaves to the Arab Muslim world. </p>
<p>Why so many American blacks are so enamored with the Muslim world and want to take their side on everything, is a mystery to me. The Arab Muslim world has treated them far more harshly than we ever thought about doing. </p>
