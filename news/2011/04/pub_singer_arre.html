			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pub singer has been arrested on suspicion of racism for singing the classic chart hit Kung Fu Fighting.</p>
<p>The song, performed by Simon Ledger, 34, is said to have offended two Chinese people as they walked past the bar where he was singing.</p>
<p>The entertainer regularly performs the 1974 number one hit, originally by disco star Carl Douglas, at the Driftwood Beach Bar in Sandown, on the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>But after one of the passers-by reported his routine on Sunday afternoon, Mr Ledger was arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were performing Kung Fu Fighting, as we do during all our sets,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;People of all races were loving it. Chinese people have never been offended by it before.</p>
<p>&#8216;But this lad walking past with his mum started swearing at us and making obscene hand gestures before taking a picture on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>&#8216;We hadn&rsquo;t even seen them when we started the song. He must have phoned the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Officers later called Mr Ledger while he was eating in a Chinese restaurant to arrange a meeting.</p>
<p>The singer assumed it was a prank  &mdash;  but he was later arrested and is still under investigation.</p>
<p>&#8216;They seemed pretty amazed but said the law is the law and it was their duty,&rsquo; he is reported to have said.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s political correctness gone potty. There are plenty of Welsh people at our shows  &mdash;  does it mean I can&rsquo;t play any Tom Jones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bar owner Sean Ware told the Sun newspaper: &#8216;The song is in no way racist and nor is Simon. There is no way he would abuse anyone.</p>
<p>&#8216;He didn&rsquo;t start the song just because Chinese people were walking past. He had already started playing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Ledger, who was later bailed, wrote on Facebook: &#8216;If the lad who phoned the police is reading this, what is wrong with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Hampshire police spokesman last night said a 32-year-old man of Chinese origin had claimed he was subjected to racial abuse.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;If a victim believes that an alleged crime is racially aggravated, the police will treat it seriously. Investigations into this incident are continuing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The spokesman said a 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing harassment, alarm or distress under section 4a of the Public Order Act 1986.</p>
<p>The man was not taken to the police station at the time, but was released on bail.</p>
<p>He will visit Newport police station today where he will be interviewed.<br>

		<p>Sheer insanity! There&rsquo;s a little game I like to play with Asian residents and business owners whenever there&rsquo;s a street fair or other public event going on in the area. I&rsquo;ll ask them casually about it, and  &mdash;  inevitably  &mdash;  they have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about. They seem to live in their own little world, oblivious to nearly everything going on in the round-eye culture that surrounds them.</p>
<p>I would bet next month&rsquo;s pay that the passer-by had never heard of this song, and thinks Mr. Ledger made it up on the spot just to bother him. That seems to be the thought process of just about any non-white who encounters a white person doing something he doesn&rsquo;t like. Combine that with the utter clueless cultural isolation of a large number of East Asians, and this is what happens.</p>

		<p>They ought to be careful here.  Arresting a singer for doing a cover version of &#8220;Kung Fu Fighting&#8221; because it offends the Chinese might itself be racist   &mdash;   It would offend the black artist who sung the original version.</p>

		<p>I am utterly appalled at the racist lyrics of this song.  I never knew such overt racism could still exist in our modern society.  In fact I am so shocked and depressed, that I have decided to immediately leave work, go home, feed my 27 cats, eat a tofu and wild-organic-thistle salad, and go straight to bed.  I may need to stay there for several days. I&rsquo;m also thinking of writing angry letters to the Queen and the UN.</p>

		<p>Well, I know the term &#8216;Chinaman&rsquo; has been designated as racist for a long time, as well as the little used, &#8216;East Indiaman&rsquo;, but no one has been able to explain to me why &#8216;Irishman&rsquo; and &#8216;Englishman&rsquo; are not racist or demeaning yet &#8216;Chinaman&rsquo; is. Calling someone oriental or an oriental is also apparently now racist. I had Korean friends and asked them about this, and they were equally mystified. So for purposes of racial harmony and  understanding, I told them if they wanted to ever refer to me as an occidental, to please feel free to do so. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt my feelings at all.<br>

		<p>I can see where a song like that might be considered racist to a person from China. &#8220;There as funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung&#8221;. With half the people in China named either Chin or Chung he probably thought the song was about him personally. </p>
<p>For some reason they failed to mention the name of the Chinese man. Could it be that he was funky Billy Chin or little Sammy Chung? </p>

<p>Interesting take on the word &#8220;harassment.&#8221; To my mind, the word conjures up visions of someone following another around  &mdash;  of stalking them  &mdash;  not of singing a song in a pub. But never let that stop the PC police from twisting a word to serve their own ends,  especially if it already has a certain convenient &#8220;fright factor,&#8221; even if they have to go through some considerable verbal gymnastics to do so. </p>
<p>Kudos to Ray Stevens for, to my knowledge, never apologizing for his hit song &#8220;Ahab the Arab&#8221; or for refusing to sing it, although perhaps not in the UK.</p>

		<p>Simon Ledger should sing the old song by Rod Stewart &#8220;Every Picture Tells A Story&#8221;. The Chinese would have to be offended to hear someone sing &#8220;I fell in love with a slant eyed lady, by the light of an eastern moon&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The whole ridiculous situation where if a person is &#8220;offended&#8221; they can bring charges against a person regardless of the intention has got to stop! The performer often sang this song and no other Chinese people were offended. Not only was he already performing when the pair walked by but they were not even part of the audience. You would think that the whole silly incident would have been resolved when the facts came out.</p>

		<p>Just like the commenter @ post #4, I too had been questioned by Korean acquaintances wondering why &#8220;oriental&#8221; was un-PC.<br>
They exclaimed &#8220;but that&rsquo;s what we call ourselves!&#8221;.  Apparently they don&rsquo;t have our brand of PC in Korea, what do I know.</p>
<p>This was a number of years ago.  I did not have a good answer then, and I don&rsquo;t think I do now.  It has been my PERSONAL experience (to date) that the only people it seems to offend are white!  Go figure.</p>

<p>In England now, his name was most likely Tyrone, DuShawn, Kunte, Mbagawan or Muhammad, Hamid, Ahmad or such. I have known many Chinese people, male and female, and they are NOT a thin skinned people. Muslims and blacks! their skin is so thin they are transparent!</p>

		<p>East Asians are haughty.  They don&rsquo;t take well to humor that involves them.</p>
<p>generalquagmyer, I would bet the Chinese parasites knew the song.  East Asians are savvy about race, always have been.  White people mistakenly assume that behind the quiet facade they have little understanding of race which is 100% wrong.  Where are the East Asian Tyrones and Keishas?  Even though names like Tyrone and Keisha were created by Caucasians and you would see that in name books East Asians avoid using those names because they are now associated with black Americans.  That takes understanding the culture.  Instead East Asians knowing name themselves or children with milky white names like Bella, Robert, Iris or Thurston.</p>
<p>White people can&rsquo;t have fun in their own countries without parasites like these Chinese making trouble.  Simon Ledger now can have an arrest record over this.</p>

I am completely speechless, lost for words at the latest update of government enforced insanity that has taken that once-great nation by the throat. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t think this is remotley amusing. Just plain weird!</p>
<p>Bar owner Sean Ware told the Sun newspaper: &lsquo;The song is in no way racist and nor is Simon. There is no way he would abuse anyone.&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t start the song just because Chinese people were walking past. He had already started playing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Why, in the face of this absurd charge does this man have to grovel and say &#8216;no, no it&rsquo;s not racist?&rsquo; If anything strong language should be used in the opposite. This bloke has been arrested for singing a song that I hear every now and again on a mainstream radio station! And the original performer is a black man!</p>
<p>As an aside, should ever band / performer feel nervous if one of their songs has an Oriental theme? Should Rush be feeling worried, or even guilty for &#8216;Passage To Bankok?&rsquo;</p>

		<p>It seems that in Britain a white can be arrested anytime some assorted non-white person attests something to be racist.  Thus, no one knows what&rsquo;s legal and what&rsquo;s not.  The outcome must be that many whites despise non-whites with a vengeance and avoid them like the plague.  Is this what the deluded multiculti folks want?<br>
In the U.S. no one gets arrested for speaking purported racism, but can still lose a job or reputation.  I&rsquo;ve worked with many whites who were afraid to even reference black people above a whisper, even to say something good.  One year, I drew the name of my only black co-worker in a Christmas gift exchange.  When I told two other employees that I intended to give him a black history book, they were appalled and insisted that I would be pointing out his blackness!  (I gave him the book, and he was pleased).</p>

		<p>I will be perfectly honest with you.  I&rsquo;ve never read the lyrics to this song wrote out on paper before.  I&rsquo;ve only heard the song recongnizing the tune and chorus.  Apparently, unlike other cultures, I am able to put two and two together.  Knowing that disco songs were popular in the late 70&rsquo;s as were many, many, Kung-Fu &#8220;B&#8221; movies, it appears to me that the writer is simply putting the action sequence of a Kung-Fu movie in song format.  In fact, I think more people realize this than I give them credit for.  Yep, smells like a deliberate attempt to smear a native Englishman.  And in the PC whacko UK, it worked! </p>

		<p>The irony is this:</p>
<p>The song dates back to the early 1970s, during which time Bruce Lee was very popular and had a cult following in Britain - a time when many White boys imitated their hero in the school-yard by practising high kicks and pretending they were Bruce Lee.At that time many White British youths took courses in the martial arts and read up on Eastern philosophy and even gas stations gave out something they called &#8216;fighting stars&rsquo; with every gallon of gasoline to retain custom.The Television series &#8216;Kung-Fu&rsquo; with Keith Carradine was also very popular then.</p>
<p>The song and the spirit it embodied was done in tribute and not mockery.</p>

		<p>This is remarkable moral development.  Now one can make the mere claim that one is &#8220;offended&#8221; and the offendee, even if he intended no offense nor committed an act that practically no one could argue was offensive, is guilty.  </p>
<p>This is government gone mad, government specifically intended to empower people with special privileges which can be used to oppress those around them, those who intended them no harm or malice.  And only the allegation of offense is required. Only the word of the offendee that he is offended is needed to find the offender quilty as charged, even if there is no evidence on its face that the alleged offense is consistent with custom or behavioral standards. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m offended by your suit! Go home and take it off or I shall summon the police!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is utter insanity.</p>

		<p>Just being uncomfortable is considered harassement.  mr. ledger should report the Chinese man who accused him of racial abuse for racial abuse.</p>
<p>Since it is imperative that police investigate, let them investigate the Princess and the Pea oh so sensitive Chinese man.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the original Princess and the Pea story set in China? Mr. Ledger should enlist a group of friends and relatives to report this Chinese man.  Make a new report about twice a month for a couple years.  That should teach him.  It will also harass and annoy the police.</p>
<p>You say Englishmen don&rsquo;t like to lie? Do as the Chinese do, fight fire with fire.  Don&rsquo;t bring truth to a falsehood festival.</p>

		<p>The word &#8220;Oriental&#8221; is of Greek origin, meaning &#8220;the direction where the sun rises&#8221;.  It has no pejorative content, and never did.  It is actually a very fitting name for people who call their country &#8220;The Land of the Rising Sun&#8221;, or whose national anthem is, &#8220;The East is Red&#8221;.  About 30 or 40 years ago, a Japanese-American Red from Berkeley decided to invent a synthetic grievance to unite the Chinese and Japanese leftists on campus.  The term he chose to replace Oriental was &#8220;Asian&#8221;, a complete misnomer.  The same people who insist on correcting Columbus by calling Indians &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;, have no trouble excluding Arabs, Iranians, Punjabis, Bengalis, ad infinitum, from the category &#8220;Asian&#8221;.  The only rationale for the term is to get on a high horse and look down on everyone else.  </p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the offended Chinese merely thought that the accused was performing a strange caricature of Chinese singing.</p>
<p>After all, the lyrics of any song in a typical gin-mill are totally unintelligible, and what with with the performer doing the typical wild and bizarre gyrations in what passes for &#8220;performing&#8221; these days, I can easily see how anybody not culturally acclimated to North America could get the wrong idea about such a performance.</p>
<p>Obviously, a more rational response would be a puzzled shake of the head, a shrug of the shoulders, and continuing down the sidewalk. Of course, now everybody&rsquo;s looking for something to be offended about.</p>

		<p>I agree, some singer in England singing Kung-Fu fighting song is not offending at all!!</p>
<p>One of my favourite films of all time is Kung-Fu Panda.  That film made 630 million dollars overall, and when the movie ends, the song Kung-Fu fighting plays while the credits are being displayed.</p>

		<p>Surreal, but a flexing of non-white political muscle nevertheless. Nevertheless, the working class in Blighty will vote in the very Labour traitors who instituted these abomination&hellip;licking the hand that beats them.  </p>
