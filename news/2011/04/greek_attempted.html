<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hooded, unidentified young man tried to hit  the so-called father of the DNA, Nobel laureate for Medicine and Physiology, Professor James Watson, 83, during a conference at the University of Patras. While Watson was speaking to students, a group of some 20 young people entered the conference hall and attempted to lift a banner. One man from the group holding a flag climbed on stage and approached Watson. Two professors and some students intervened, jumped on the young man and dragged him off.  One professor and one student were very slightly injured.</p>
<p>James Watson [suffered no] harm. The protesters were booed by the audience.</p>
<p>News portal <a href="http://news247.gr/ellada/prospathhsan_na_xtyphsoyn_ton_patera_toy_dna.834228.html">news247.gr</a> reported that the intruders wanted to protest about some &#8216;racist&rsquo; statements by Nobel Prize winner Watson, that &#8220;black people were less intelligent than whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to CNN in 2007 a British Museum had even cancelled Watson&rsquo;s lecture upon his remarks:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;The eminent biologist told a British newspaper he was &#8220;inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa&#8221; because &#8220;all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really.&#8221;
<p>Watson, 79, had been due to give a lecture at London&rsquo;s Science Museum on Friday but the museum canceled his appearance, saying his comments had &#8220;gone beyond the point of acceptable debate.&#8221; (cnn.com) </blockquote></p>

		<p>Blacks have replaced other deities as the new &#8220;gods&#8221; of the Leftist religion. You can question Jesus (encouraged), you can question Mohammed (please don&rsquo;t!), you can question the very concept of God (old hat), but Blacks simply cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>The godhood of Blacks is not open for debate. The only reason Blacks do not lead all of humanity into a new golden age of prosperity is due to the malice of Whites. Whites must realize this and exist in a state of permanent servitude towards their non-White, especially Black, masters.</p>
<p>Whites are not allowed to appeal to reality. Blacks are superior and whoever questions this is a nazi and must be eliminated. </p>

		<p>Woe to the Western world when the truth cannot be spoken and accepted.  For this one deluded protester, his behavior is understood to be supported and justified by the authorities that suppressed Watson&rsquo;s freedom of speech.  This behavior is similar to in the 1970&rsquo;s when Richard Jensen came out with his theories and studies supporting the inferiority of black genes while at UC Berkeley.  Unfortunately, the inferiority of black genes is supported by empirical evidence, as exemplified by inner cities, Africa, Haiti.  The blacks will sink to their own natural level when white support is no longer there.  By the way, where are those black geniuses that Hawking was going to find in Africa?  He boasted that he would surely find some in response to Watson&rsquo;s statement concerning the intelligence of blacks.</p>

		<p>This is part of the leftist paradigm.  They don&rsquo;t respect scientific achievement.  They don&rsquo;t repect scholarship.  Instead, they believe posturing and shouting racism puts them on par with any scholar.  And we have a large part of society that caters to them, and another large segment that just reamains silent.</p>
<p>These guys should have been arrested for disturbing the peace.</p>

		<p>The young generation in Greece are mostly morons&hellip;I spent a little bit of time in that &#8216;semi-nation&rsquo;, and saw exactly what 40 plus years of Socialist rule has done to them. It is basically a defacto communist state, where people believe they are entitled to be taken care of by taxpayers; when the gravy runs dry, they take up arms to extort their populace and the rest of Europe. Funny these same socialist fanatics - from professors right down to rebel youths - all have a taste for luxurious items. </p>
<p>Greece should be used only as an example for what leftward thinking does to a people. <br>

<p><br>
Unfortunately, that was a poor choice of wording.  Even for a Nobel scholar!  Evidently, he was taken off guard.  What he really meant to say was  <i>&#8220;based on the <b>assumption</b>&#8221; </i> of equality, not on any such  &#8220;fact&#8221;.  But that&rsquo;s alright, professor.  We understand your meaning  (and we agree).</p>

		<p>Black people *are* on average less intelligent than whites.  If this statement is racist, then reality is racist.  It is never wrong to acknowledge reality.  Therefore there is nothing wrong with racism.  People have to understand that &#8220;racism&#8221; is nothing more than a magical word that the left uses to control the right.  If you don&rsquo;t want to be controlled by leftists you have to stop being afraid of that word.</p>
<p>As for Watson, perhaps he has learned by now that there is nothing to be gained by back pedaling and groveling for forgiveness from your leftist enemies.  They&rsquo;re only going to kick you harder when you&rsquo;re down on your knees.<br>

		<p>The man who these thugs tried to physically attack (apart from being of advanced age), happens to be an intellectual giant, perhaps the most accomplished living scientist.<br>
  I wonder if the thugs have any idea whatsoever as to the breadth and profundity of Watson&rsquo;s work, or of its implications and ramifications in answering the deepest philosophical questions of existence.<br>
 Unfortunately, this is par for the course for the fascist left.All they think about is beating, hitting, punching, kicking, injuring anyone who has the temerity to disagree with them,  a 79 year old, frail respected genius does not stand in the way of their tiny little minds.</p>

<p>Greece is a particularly interesting example. Papavassiliou (1954) looked at IQ, socioeconomic status and fertility for men and came up with the following results.</p>
<p>Intelligence and Fertility in Greece, 1950s</p>
<p>Socioeconomic Status	Number Surveyed	Mean IQ	Number of Children<br>
Professionals	41	117.2	1.78<br>
Skilled Workers	80	100.9	2.66<br>
Semi-skilled Workers	27	91	4<br>
Unskilled Workers	67	82.2	5.56<br>
My calculations give an IQ of 96.9 for the parent generation and an IQ drop of 4.9. Using a heritability of .82 for IQ puts the IQ of the children&rsquo;s generation at 92.9 (IQ of parent generation – .82 x 4.9). Lynn has found elsewhere that the IQ of Greece is 95. This low (for Europe) figure is surprising considering the country&rsquo;s historical accomplishments. Papavassiliou&rsquo;s data may solve the puzzle.</p>

<p>Yes, but this was the better version - most of the present Greeks wanted to hear what Dr Watson had to say and the protesters were quickly overwhelmed and booed. <br>
While in the Western countries the opposite was true and Watson&rsquo;s talks were canceled or allowed to be disturbed.</p>

		<p>Didn&rsquo;t Professor Watson make some statement of apology for his views a few years ago?  Of course, everyone knows what he really thinks  &mdash;  the same as 99% of humanity, even though liberals vehemently deny it.  </p>
<p>If scientists like Watson were talking gibberish  &mdash;  claiming, say, that the ancient Egyptians could fly like Afrocentrists insist  &mdash;  then the left wouldn&rsquo;t give a hoot who heard them.

		<p>This story is not an all out depressing, negative story as the 83 year old White professor who once spoke the truth was not beaten and forced to flee, recant etc. Instead the Leftist thugs were driven back/away.</p>
<p>This is a good story for us.</p>
<p>And this is the area where our side needs to really improve on. We have lots of bright, reasonable folks on our side presenting the facts of life, nature racial realities in a reasonable way. But the antis are not &#8220;reasonable&#8221; and their is nothing &#8220;fair&#8221; about the tactics of University mob rule, with support from entrenched elites.</p>
<p>Our side tends to do OK, well in all out wars with jet fighters, missiles, soldiers in uniforms, but we are really poor in facing small groups of Leftist agitators.</p>
<p>These agitators are shouting down American Renaissance conferences, intimidating even remotely conservative speakers on college campuses and it&rsquo;s just a question of force/power - 2nd amendment gun type conservatives are useless in such situations.</p>
<p>We need White biker clubs/gangs, hard hats, coal miners, MMA fighters and not the top guys, but the local guys. We do have guys who can get down and dirty and give back to these vile antis - but rich Conservative Whites need to reach out to these folks.</p>

<p>Greece and Mediterranean Europe, in general, are prime examples of the pitfalls of Miscegenation. <br>
Is it not obvious that the lower I.Q. found in these regions is directly correlated to the mixing of these people with their non-European neighbors or invaders? </p>
<p>Sicily, Greece, Spain and Portugal have too much in common to refute this correlation. They were all invaded and occupied by &#8216;Oriental&rsquo; non-European people for centuries, which in turn did dilute the original blood line. I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say that all of the Mediterraneans are affected, but I can say through experience and observation that their are considerable segments within these peoples that look, act, and think like Middle Easterners or North Africans. <br>
It is no coincidence that modern Greeks cannot compare to their ancient predecessors.<br>
Mediterranean Europeans are an example for what&rsquo;s in store for USA and Northern Europe if the immigration invasion continues: a greater decline in I.Q., GDP, ingenuity, and civility.   </p>

		<p>9 Edmundo: Victor Davis Hansen, farmer and professor of Ancient Greece wrote about the ignorance of modern Greeks.  He said that 40 years ago, it was an unpaved 3rd World country.  Now it&rsquo;s paved and polluted, but the Greeks didn&rsquo;t do it, the EU did.  Big projects, paid for with big loans, built a outwardly BMW society that is still in the donkey cart stage socially, and the peasants in designer jeans can&rsquo;t pay for it.  They don&rsquo;t understand why things should not be free and they are unhappy.  Attacking Dr Watson is just a side effect of their leftist mania.  </p>

		<p>If you REALLY want to freak these people out, read documents from pre-civil war times that describes what slavery was like.</p>
<p>Slaves were treated well and enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle that was way higher than supposed free people being employed in European workhouses.  Think about the term &#8220;Uncle&#8221;&hellip;..as in &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; and what it implies.  This, extremely common term was used to express FAMILIAL relationship with slaves.  Slaves, although property, were VERY often, treated as family.  And for the most part, were treated with respect.  They had a very high standard of living, compared with the rest of the world.</p>
<p><br>
Despite incredible amounts of money poured into propaganda, there were no slave revolts, to speak of.  Many blacks even went so far as to fight for the south, after the civil war.  And after that war, they did not want to leave.  Or more to the point, where would they go?</p>
<p>Blacks, post civil war, did not so much gain their freedom as lost their livelihood.  They shared the fate of the land owners as all pretense of the rule of law was abandoned and &#8220;carpet baggers&#8221; used the north&rsquo;s military to steal from white and black person alike&hellip;.turning them out on the streets.</p>
<p>The deification of the black man, in this nation is based on the need to repent for sins that never took place, lead by a &#8220;clergy&#8221; that were (and still are) the real villains.</p>
<p>Amazingly, none of this is secret.  Anyone who has a mind to, and an internet connection, can find out the truth to counteract the lies you were taught in school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how little they think of us.  They tell bald faced, easily countered lies, knowing full well that countering that with the well documented truth is ineffective because their adherents are simply too lazy to think for themselves.</p>
<p>And they do it all the time.  To the point that I am tempted to say we have a new classism in the western world.  Those who treat the lies they are told with skepticism and actively seek out the truth and confirmation about things&hellip;..and those that obey the TV and believe whatever it tells them, without question.</p>
<p>Who are the real slaves?</p>

I direct everyone to Lothrop Stoddard&rsquo;s book &#8216;The Revolt Against Civilisation&rsquo; and in-particular chapter 2, which is entitled &#8216;Nature&rsquo;s Iron Law of Inequality.&rsquo;<br>
Encourage as many people as you can to free themselves from this fantasy world of equality; the result being that you will at least have a more realistic view of the world around you. </p>

<p>In my graduate studies in American History, it was my misfortune to have to study a lot of Antebellum history. I found it rather boring. But I read hundreds of original texts, not regurgitated stuff. I can say, confidently, that you are simply wrong.<br>
Slavery in the USA  was no easy ride. Some were treated well (for property), some were treated OK, some horribly. <br>
Their standard of living was indeed above most of the world, but they were SLAVES. <br>
That&rsquo;s worse than death.<br>
That, in my mind, is what AM Ren is about. We will not be slaves .<br>
It was wrong to enslave Africans. ( I&rsquo;m not claiming you said it was, so no offense intended). And I don&rsquo;t seek just to argue with you, but to offer the experience I had reading and writing for thousands of hours. <br>
It bored me to death, but as a historian, I looked with my own eyes. <br>
I did focus on the Mexican American war, and THAT was interesting. I know all too well the disgusting myths about Reconquista claims. They are absurd&hellip;more so in fact, than the USA claiming it owns the moon.<br>
Cheers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;People have to understand that &ldquo;racism&rdquo; is nothing more than a magical word that the left uses to control the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, &amp; we all need to stop using it.  Because it means nothing   &mdash;   a word that means whatever the speaker wants it to mean, is essentially meaningless. It&rsquo;s a device to shut you up, &amp; nothing more.  Stop using the word to describe others, &amp; stop trying to defend yourself from the accusation, because that&rsquo;s the trap the left likes to set for you. </p>

		<p>The division between north and south is as old as time itself, literally. Laurasia (North America and Eurasia) separated from the supercontinent early in the age of the dinosaurs. Eventually, North America and Eurasia separated, but the north has remained distinct from the south ever since then. No surprise, is it, that the human species also separated into two branches corresponding to the this geological and geographic division?</p>
<p>What it all means, you decide.</p>

		<p>Three cheers for the young Greek students who pushed that Commie with his red/black rag off the stage!  It is incredible to me how passive most &#8220;conservatives&#8221; are in response to these leftist thugs when they disrupt a speaker.  Perhaps there is hope for Hellas.</p>
<p>It is common sense that heredity plays a factor in intelligence.  This man is a great scientist and deserves to be heard.  I am personally a creationist, so I would probably disagree with him regarding origins, but his DNA research is irrefutable.  Sad that these goons did not want him to be heard, but wonderful that the Greek students attending pushed them back!</p>

		<p>If the world is not fair, then expecting people to abandon such a useful club as &#8216;racist!&rsquo; labeling is foolish.</p>
<p>You may bemoan and cajole and angrily retaliate against the assumption that the label (WITCH!) is anachronistic and propagandistic for what it covers up of the truth.</p>
<p>But what stopped one Inquisition was not the lack of force in American laws as European ones (hanging vs. burning, you&rsquo;re still dead) against paganism or witchcraft.  It was the lack of women to torture.  Precious resources tend to be viewed in spite of their flaws rather than because of them.</p>
<p>The same condition can apply here, in reverse.  Without an ethnic overburden (the amount of earth needed to be removed to get a particular amount of mineral) to dilute our efforts, we can shine in our own right in a way that continues the historical white tradition of pioneering ideas and systems.</p>
<p>Thus, to defeat racism you have to create a world where the onus of proving black (and Mestizo and even Asian) IQ and social more` differences are removed completely and thus have a situation where application of the R-word label is not appropriate because the PROOF lies in the comparison of achievements by those who _choose_ to still be burdened by their own, idiotic, racial guilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, we&rsquo;re racist, when did you last contribute to physics, genetics, engineering, philosophy?&#8221;  Is a **GREAT** way to shut someone up.</p>
<p>The way forward for all of us is to realize that environmental stresses have gifted some genelines with greater degrees of intuitive insight and rational logic skills (not necessarily opposed) within a more conservative behavior baseline.</p>
<p>And to find the long sequences that activate those brain functions and make them available to all.</p>
<p>Until we can get there, we need to create robotics which can replace skilled labor and give these 70-90 IQ populations a reasonable standard of living.  And the rest of us, freedom from an underclass whose only real skill is breeding.</p>
<p>But to have that for them (genomic therapy, applied exogenically) we must first have it for ourselves.  And that requires acknowledging that there is something worth exclusively conserving in the white genome, by separation.</p>
<p>Not segregation.  SEPARATION.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that may be the most useful element of our rabid endorsement of &#8216;democracy and capitalism&rsquo; in Russia, SWA and now the Mediterannean: creating a viewpoint that says: &#8220;White nationalism, if it can be achieved by a dominant demography in a given region, has the same right to exist as we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Greece and Mediterranean Europe, in general, are prime examples of the pitfalls of Miscegenation.  Is it not obvious that the lower I.Q. found in these regions is directly correlated to the mixing of these people with their non-European neighbors or invaders?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Papavassiliou wrote down that data (in 1954) how many &#8220;Oriental non-European peoples&#8221; were living in Greece (relative to today)?  What I gathered from reading Lynn&rsquo;s article was that Greece&rsquo;s declining avg. IQ in the 20th century is due more to much higher birthrates among the lower classes than anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also curious: to what do you subscribe the lower avg. IQ of Celtic Irishmen relative to other Northern Europeans?  I wonder if you&rsquo;re aware that according to Lynn (IQ and Global Inequality) the Portuguese outscore the Irish on IQ tests.  Any thoughts?</p>

<p>With respect to Spain, Portugal and Italy, let&rsquo;s not forget that the northern regions of these countries were re-populated by white barbaric tribes like the Visigoths, Vandals, Suevis and Lombards in the 5th and 6th centuries.  Also, lands were granted to many English, French and German Crusaders as rewards for helping drive out the Moors in the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I would be very interested in seeing whether the IQ of these white regions would be significantly higher than those in the non-pure white regions.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned that. You know your history! Yes, modern Spain and Portugal are largely a creation of the Crusades, many of whose crusaders and their followers came from Northern Europe and settled there. Portugal, for instance, was founded by Henry and Raymond of Burgundy, two  French knights and cousins, who joined  in the Reconquest. Henry&rsquo;s son Afronso Henriques &#8220;The Conqueror&#8221; became the first King of Portugal.</p>
<p>As for your last question, I read in a travel book many years ago (long before political correctness or white guilt became vogueish) that the Spanish province of Murcia (on the SE coast facing N. Africa) has the highest remaining element of Moorish population.  It also has/had the highest crime rate! </p>
<p>I need make no further comment, except to say that this was before the present invasion of Moors that is going on right now, with the full blessing of the Spanish socialist government.</p>
<p>I should add too that (true) Spanish people are known for being very proud and honest, even back when they were wretchedly  poor. What crime there was came mostly from Gypsies, who were always out of control and a major social problem.</p>
