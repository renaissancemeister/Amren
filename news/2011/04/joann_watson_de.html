<h1>Joann Watson: Detroit Deserves Bailout &#8216;At Least&rsquo; As Big As GM</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Detroit News, April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Councilwoman JoAnn Watson is reiterating her call for a government bailout of Detroit, saying the city that built the middle class deserves as much help as Wall Street or General Motors.</p>
<p>Addressing the City Council today during Mayor Dave Bing&rsquo;s budget presentation, Watson gave a spirited pitch for federal funds to help the city whose population declined 25 percent since 2000 to 713,777.</p>
<p> &#8220;We are worth it. We are worth at least as much as General Motors or Chrysler or the Wall Street bankers,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;It was this city that built military vehicles for World War II. It was this city that (invented) the middle class and the five-day work week.</p>
<p>{snip}&#8221;</p>
<p>General Motors received $52 billion in government aid, while Chrysler received $12.5 billion, according to published reports. {snip}</p>
<p>In the past, Watson has said the city deserves at least $1 billion.</p>

		<p>The Detroit that invented the middle class was the Detroit of another day, a Detroit that was overwhelmingly white, and a Detroit whose labor unions were focused on what they were supposed to do, i.e. organize labor for better pay, benefits and working conditions, and to exert pressure on the political system to restrict immigration to head off cheap labor.</p>

		<p>She looks like she belongs in an African nation with that crazy getup, it&rsquo;s hard to take her serious. Someone should first ask her &#8220;how did Detroit get into this mess to begin with?&#8221; $1 Billion? That money would disappear so fast and you would see gold spinner rims on all the mail trucks.

		<p>Part of the reason GM failed is because they stayed in Detroit.</p>
<p>And part of the reason the gov got involved is because GM was in Detroit.</p>
<p>In short, it was about Detroit.</p>

		<p>This makes me angry.  The government didn&rsquo;t bail out GM.  They stole GM from the bondholders.</p>
<p>In a normal bankruptcy, shareholders would get wiped out, the union would be reigned in and under court supervision some of the old contracts would be terminated.  Bondholders would take over the company.  New shares would be issued to raise funds and new negotiations with the union would ensue.</p>
<p>Instead, Obama, stepped in and stole the company from the bondholders.  The equity was then given to the the government, the union, and New York financial institutions  &mdash;   only 10% of the new equity went to the bondholders.  Bondholders got robbed.  </p>
<p>And the sad thing is, GM will probably self-destruct again because they didn&rsquo;t fix the underlying problems that caused the bankruptcy in the first place.  </p>

		<p>No matter how much you give to the blacks they will squander it.</p>
<p>Maybe if the blacks did not make it so unpleasant for the tax paying whites, the whites would not have taken their tax dollars and left.</p>
<p>That aside, GM and Chrysler should not have been given a nickle.</p>

		<p>I definitely sympathize with the sentiments that if the bankers and big business can get bailouts, why not struggling Americans but I don&rsquo;t think all the money in the world could change Detroit given the current demographic situation. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was this city that built military vehicles for World War II. It was this city that (invented) the middle class and the five-day work week.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I find it amazing that this woman feels that she and the rest of present day Detroit feel as though they should be treated as though they had something to do with the former industrial might of Detroit. Joann Watson and her people had everything to do with the destruction of Detroit and its people and nothing to do with anything productive. Most of Detroit is now on some sort of public assistance. While the population may be declining, those who are there require free food, healthcare, money in the form of welfare, free housing, schooling, prisons, courts, police, drug rehab programs, childcare for parents who don&rsquo;t work and every other social service a government could possibly provide, all on the white man&rsquo;s dime. Why on earth would anyone want to pay more money for what they know they don&rsquo;t want. These people used to have the threat of a riot on their side. The threat of a riot with elderly parents and grandparents being held hostage for decades. These people have spit in the face of those who built and maintained the greatest industrial city on earth in its hayday as a lifestyle for decades. These people destroyed Detroit. The parents and grandparents of the old Detroit mostly left in droves with many still keeping faith and staying loyal only to be held hostage until the day they died, and now they&rsquo;re dead and gone. Joann Watson still lives in the fantasy land that she still has enough hostages to make demands on white people.  She says she wants at least a billion dollars but she&rsquo;s forgetting one thing. Without a hostage there is no ransom! </p>

The current demographic has produced the urban decay which has you crying for that federal bailout.</p>

		<p>Oh yes, give Detroit billions. In fact, give all blacks reparations I say. Give them all $100,000. It will stimulate the economy. Within 30 days Cadillac, Popeye&rsquo;s Fried Chicken, dental gold, nail salon&rsquo;s, Malt liquor and Nike&rsquo;s stock will be through the roof. </p>
<p>Then 30 days after that it will be back to normal&hellip;.all Whitey&rsquo;s fault for not giving them $200,000.</p>

		<p>A good bailout would only promote to everyone would would happen if money is given to blacks all over again, make the city look white&hellip;but then the true colors will eventually emerge and be unleashed as the well-known population of Detroit to prove to the U.S. that money is truly not worth spent in Detroit. Japan can spend $100 to rebuild their quake/tsusami torn land in a better way than blacks in Detroit being loaned millions to improve (destroy) detroit again.</p>

<p>Anyone who dresses as this woman does is going to play the race card and she&rsquo;s no exception.  She&rsquo;s using race (white America) as a hostage, implying that if she does not receive the money, the implication is her African people are not as worthy as the car companies receiving bail money. Anybody who disagrees with her is in essence saying her people are not worth as much as the car companies and thus, is a &#8220;racist.&#8221; This is exactly what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>What this afro-centrist fails to acknowledge is you can not &#8220;bail out&#8221; a life style of dependence and destruction, any more that you can bail out a failed business model or product that is inferior to a competitor. Besides, her people are &#8220;bailed out&#8221; everyday through welfare, section 8, food stamps, and a host of other federal programs. </p>
<p>The hostage here is the American people whose federal tax dollars would be used for any bail out.<br/>

		<p>Anyone willing to make a bet that Detroit will be the first major American city too completely collapse? By collapse, I mean an abandoned ruin, home to outlaws and barbarians. No law, no civil governance. Has any major or minor city been well run by the blacks? Or school district? Reality sucks, but there you are.   </p>

		<p>Want to think of something scary?  In about 40 years Ms Watson won&rsquo;t have to *ask* for a bailout.  She and her kind will compromise a large enough percentage of the population that they&rsquo;ll be able to elect the kind of politicians who will cheerfully indulge their *demands* for a bailout.  </p>

<p>Hmmm. no those were white people. They were chased away by 40 years ago by your people in violent bloody race riots. </p>
<p>The only point of keeping Detroit around is to contain its undesirable criminal population in a concentrated area away from the rest of society.  I would say warehouse the majority of its population in giant housing projects and then bulldoze about 90 percent of the sprawl and turn it back into forest. (which is sort of what they are doing anyay)</p>

		<p>Once again, black entitlement and unwarranted self importance shines through. Detroit is 80 percent black and so dysfunctional that many parts of the city go without basic services like fire departments and trash collection. Half of the city is deserted and most of the whites have fled to the suburbs.</p>
<p>The blacks made their bed but now they don&rsquo;t want to sleep in it.<br/>
They &#8220;deserve&#8221; billions of dollars for mediocrity and failure.<br/>
Why? Because they are black, and we are white, and we need to give them green money.</p>

		<p>First off, GM and Chrysler were paid to stay in the game because if they weren&rsquo;t GM and Chryslers would be built &#8216;anyway&rsquo;, without the payoffs to U.S. patent owners.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the nature of a multinational enterprise in a Communist (PRC) or Kleptocratic (Central American) society where all controlling elements of the manufacturing infrastructure are not protected by U.S. laws so much as committed &#8216;profit sharing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Second, if they aren&rsquo;t paid to live where they are at, it&rsquo;s not going to be long before the blacks and other poor of Detroit come looking for a handout where the rest of society lives.</p>
<p>There are so few white sanctuaries left, do you REALLY want to see some 3/4 of a million blacks to start &#8216;migrating&rsquo;?</p>
<p>That said, we could make of this a &#8216;teachable moment&rsquo; social experiment.</p>
<p>Like the new president of Haiti suggested: supply only materiel logistics (food and cable) and housekeeping expertise (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, janitorial, food delivery).  Create project like tract houses or high rises and &#8216;install&rsquo; these people on the condition that:</p>
<p>1.  If you wreck it, you will be evicted, no one will come help <br/>
    you and you will never get another home _because we have <br/>
    your name and number from the last one you ruined_.</p>
<p>2.  If you go in, you get sterilized so you cannot breed more <br/>
    handout entitlement victims.</p>
<p>I would bet that, given the above conditions: no crime, take care of your place, no children.  You would see blacks who chose to live in the Detroit Social Welfare Zone improve.</p>
<p>Or you would see the proof of why they cannot be helped.</p>
<p>Shrug.  Either way works.  Because it justifies everything else that would come after.  Everything that white taxpayers would be empowered to do because blacks couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The key is to make, not an EMPTY example of a ruined city for whom the ethnic nature of the destruction is &#8216;arguable&rsquo; for lack of present witnesses or occupants.</p>
<p>But to make sure that you create a situation where blacks can self-sustain.  And then let the whites see how low a (commited personal improvement) social level that sustainment really is.</p>
<p>Before we go inviting more of the third world to join them on our shores (Africa, now at 1 billion is heading for 2 billion by 2050, despite AIDS and genocidal wars.  Five of the top ten TFR growth states for 2000-2010 are in Africa.  All this despite mass movement to cities which are rapidly becoming Mumbai like).</p>
<p>Someone mentioned &#8216;hostages&rsquo;.  I would say instead &#8216;examples&rsquo;.  Let Detroit be a never ending example of what blackness is really about.</p>
<p>Then, when we separate, we can all point and laugh.</p>

		<p>Sometimes a city/town fades away. It is nothing new. There are sites all over the world where people once lived but now are lost to memory. One day Detroit may be one of them and humanity will continue elsewhere.</p>

<p>You do not know how right you are.</p>
<p>Dozens of black athletes who once made millions of dollars a year have recently filed for bankruptcy and alarming rates.  In other words, no matter how much money some people are given, they will always spend/waste it all.  Even if the $1 billion was divided up to the 700,000 blacks living in Detroit, each would only get $1,428.  If $100 billion were spent on Detriot and each black got $142,800, how long would it take the city to ruin it?</p>
<p>I truly wish productive Americans *could* give money to the minority communities and watch them turn into productive, respectful, law-abiding citizens.  It would be easy and only temporarily painful.  Instead, no easy answer exists besides segregation  &mdash;  which is what nearly all whites do in practice even though they don&rsquo;t admit it.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;We are worth it. We are worth at least as much as General Motors or Chrysler or the Wall Street bankers,&rdquo; Watson said.</i></p>
<p>Supporting black-run cities is the worst investment a productive society can make. The blacks in charge know that, and will promptly decide to steal any money we give to the &#8220;underprivileged.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;It was this <b>white</b></i> city that built military vehicles for World War II. It was <b>the whites of this city that (invented) the middle class and the five-day work week.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Next, she&rsquo;ll claim that they invented cars in the first place and we just stole their ideas.</p>
<p>A new generation is coming and that generation sees the constant gifts of money to Africans in America as <b>nothing less than appeasement</b> to avoid another storm of riots. <br/>
