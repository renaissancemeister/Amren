<h1><a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/04/14/brutal-fights-caught-on-tape-at-hayward-high-school/">Brutal Fights Caught on Tape at Hayward High School</a></h1>
 

<p>KCBS-TV (San Francisco), April 14, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Police have stepped up patrols at Hayward High School following a string of brawls that may be tied to local gangs, some of the fights were recently caught on cell phone video. https://www.youtube.com/user/InternetRapesTV#g/u</p>
<p>Massive fights broke out last Thursday, and were followed up the next day after class. Video, which was posted on YouTube, suggests tensions between African-American and Latino students, with the possibility of a gang influence involved.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school has a dress code, and claims to prohibit the wearing of red or blue. While some schools in the district have a zero-tolerance policy on gang colors, our reporters found students openly wearing prohibited clothing Thursday.</p>
<p>Superintendent Janis Duran said, despite the fight videos, Hayward High is a safe place for students.</p>

<p>Marquis Le Blanc was 18 when he went to a party in on Virginia Avenue that drew about 200 people, most of them Latino.</p>
<p>Some time after arriving at the party Le Blanc was attacked by a group of teens and young men. They beat him, stabbed him and shot him.</p>
<p>Pomona police made several arrests. Eight people have been charged with murder in the killing of Le Blanc.</p>
<p>The last two years of [Jessica] Corde&rsquo;s life have been filled with pain, anger and grief resulting from her son&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Corde believes that based on information presented during in preliminary court proceedings held last year that those who attacked her son were acting out of racial hatred.</p>
<p>Le Blanc arrived at the party with friends. Some time later, a dispute broke out between another man and Le Blanc, who was the only African American in attendance.</p>
<p>The situation escalated and Le Blanc took out a gun, that his mother said did not function, and waved it around trying to clear the way so he could escape.</p>
<p>Le Blanc was able to leave the party but he was followed and attacked in the street.</p>
<p>Corde is still mourning her son&rsquo;s death but she is also troubled by racial tension that exists among some African Americans and Latinos which is resulting in violence and the deaths of young people.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re burying our kids at an enormous rate,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Corde&rsquo;s journey has put her in contact with Latina mothers who have lost children to African American assailants.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hurt the same way regardless of our color,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Le Blanc&rsquo;s death was among several incidents that prompted several people in Pomona to address racial tensions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since Le Blanc&rsquo;s death people have acknowledged a problem exists and are now working with young people to address racial tensions, he said.</p>
