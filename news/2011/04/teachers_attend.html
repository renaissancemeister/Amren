		<p>Inner city schools are frequently dangerous places where little learning occurs. This is because many of the students cannot be educated, and violently interfere with the education of others. <br>
 <br>
A conference like this is not only a waste of tax payers&rsquo; money. It sends public school teachers the message that expressing legitimate concerns about the social environments of predominately black schools may be dangerous to their careers. </p>

		<p>I would have liked Sean to point out the anti-white hatred by the radicals involved in this disgusting conference.</p>
<p>Note that he had to have a black man from CORE say the things that needed to be said, because he isn&rsquo;t permitted to say them himself.</p>
<p>How great it would be to have an articulate white expounding to the nth degree in response to this racist black in the video who claims that black lack of achievement is due to alleged oppression, racism and slavery, instead of admitting blacks can&rsquo;t succeed, because, as a group, they&rsquo;re not smart enough. </p>
<p>It is usually said blacks are in denial, but that&rsquo;s not really  accurate. Denial is only part of the problem.  Most of them are just plain and simply delusional.</p>
<p>In twenty years, if this country isn&rsquo;t split apart, this black jerk on the right in the video and ALL the others will be excusing the achievement gap on the very same things they claim are holding blacks back today, because no matter what is done there is no way to make up for lack of black intelligence, and blacks will still be lagging behind everybody else.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Hannity should have pointed out that Hispanics do better than blacks also, as do all other races in the US.</p>

<p>We all KNOW why that is!  White men will not be allowed to speak up like the black man can. White men will be demonized, cut off, and called every name in the book, yet they allow some black guy to &#8220;defend&#8221; us?  Seems some Whites get all fuzzy and mushy whenever a black says what we can&rsquo;t say&hellip;I don&rsquo;t buy it.. Innis is making money somewhere in that CORE org. Bet your bottom dollar.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need nor want a black &#8220;hero&#8221;. Too many Whites adore the late MLK as their hero as if he were a White guy. Maybe it is because he is a BLACK that they adore him so.</p>
<p> As for any black speaking for us, including Innis, I have my doubts that he is anywhere near &#8220;pro-white&#8221;. Look at Colin Powell, etc. who claimed to be &#8220;conservatives&#8221; and who are not.</p>
<p>When push comes to shove we all know who these guys will side with, don&rsquo;t we? </p>

		<p>The only TRUE statement on that video was &#8220;The premise is that the U.S was started by White men for White men&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of COURSE it was!  What the heck is wrong with that? Too bad Hannity and his ilk don&rsquo;t believe it and most Whites in this nation have been so brainwashed as to actually think that White people came here so they could build and sacrifice this land for NON-whites? </p>
<p>Any THINKING, honest and rational person would KNOW that the Founders INTENDED for this nation to be settled by their own race and for their own race of people!</p>

		<p>Actually I saw something on MSNBC where a white women was complaining about how although we have such a bad economy the top 30 wealthiest people were white men except for one women. I guess as long you do not point out that some of them might belong to a certain religion other than christianity its OK to demonize these WHITE people. BTW we need a term with either and -IST or an -ISM at the end we can turn it into a nasty insult for people who just hate white people.</p>

		<p>What does health care have to do with this white privilege conference? The debater who was in favor of the white privilege conference used the word &#8216;Health Care&rsquo; in the same manner these talking heads also use the word &#8216;racism&rsquo;. We need this conference because of health care and the poor condition of African American students. Since his opponent was black maybe that was all he could do. If children are ill, wouldn&rsquo;t they be at home or in special care and not in school at all? Are so many poor, week, black children in Minnesota so frail, afflicted and unhealthy as to cause them a high dropout rate and low test scores. Are these teenagers suffering from terminal cancer and other similar illnesses? Shouldn&rsquo;t the environmental protection agency be involved and not this school teacher advocate if this is the real issue in minnesota? Perhaps after attending this conference attendees will also be able to double as medical doctors. </p>

		<p>In response to those who are disappointed about us needing a black man to speak the truth, I would only say that I believe the 5% of blacks who voted against Obama last election would likely make pretty good fellow citizens.  If the other 95% would simply magically disappear back to Africa, the US would be well on it&rsquo;s way to becoming a decent country once again.  For now, I welcome the 5%, who can help us enact a pro-white agenda.</p>

		<p>I hate the style of Fox News. I wish they would get Jared Taylor to host it. Why can&rsquo;t Fox News ever approach a topic calmly and logically? These shouting matches, phoney outrage, and transparent emotional ploys aren&rsquo;t going to convince anyone except people who already agree with them. Just calmly present the facts like a proper news show.</p>

		<p>I saw this on Hannity and wondered aloud why someone like Jared Taylor wasn&rsquo;t on the show defending whites.  I have nothing against the gentleman from CORE, who is himself an ally and conservative, but it seems even white conservatives are too afraid to defend traditional white values and white interests  &mdash;  and instead get a Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, or Niger Innis.</p>
<p>However, kudos to Sean for making this issue more mainstream by putting it on his show.</p>

<p>I agree!</p>
<p>Pastor Manning and Col Allen West are yet two more examples.</p>
<p>I guess, more intelligent and farseeing Blacks like these know full well that if Whitey fails to win back America then African-American Blacks are going to find themselves at the mercy of other distinct non-White ethnicities who suffer from no self-loathing White guilt trip-like hangups, who will grant Blacks no recognition, status or even basic fair-play in any shape or form should the successful usurper group or groups belonging to the distinct others, manage to wrestle overall control of American affairs.</p>
<p>In short, Blacks will be pushed back to the state they were at prior to the 1960s Civil Rights movement, if not further back still and this time, it could well be a permanent state.<br>

How do you intend to split this country apart? Southern states are most likely to split off. However, they have the largest black populations. Those blacks cannot be expelled. They cannot be subjected to second class citizenship. </p>

I hope more and more whites will notice  &mdash;  and take action  &mdash;  that most of these race hustlers and lots of nonwhites (I hate to admit it) hate us and/or just looking for a way to make easy money and accusing whites of being racists is a good money maker these days.</p>

<p>Really?  But it is okay for us Whites to be subjected to 2nd and 3rd class citizens in our own country?   Shall we just wave that white flag now and surrender our own survival and land and keep listening to the propaganda that people like you spiel? </p>
<p>I really do not understand your constant defense of anyone who is NOT White, unless of course you really are a troll and anti-white and have an agenda.</p>
<p>As for the majority of these comments praising Innis, or any other black who &#8220;defends&#8221; us Whites is beyond belief. Seems too many posters on Amren have bought into the lie that &#8220;some of them are good and tell us what we want to hear&#8221; nonsense. </p>
<p>Whatever &#8220;tickles the ears&#8221; is true isn&rsquo;t it, folks?  Beware of wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. The Christian church is full of them also. <br>

		<p>I have mixed feelings about this. On the whole it&rsquo;s a plus, because this kind of thing would not have made the MSM even two or three years ago. It´s an indication that the average white is starting to lose patience. This is encouraging.</p>
<p>On the other hand Hannity, who is a light-weight, brings up the topic and then invites two black guys. All Niger Innis really cared about was that he thought this was hurting black children and Hannity not once brought up the only issue that matters, the demonization and disposession of whites in their own countries. No offense to fans but Hannity, Limbaugh and their ilk are worthless on race issues. </p>
<p>Luckily it doesn&rsquo;t matter. More and more whites draw their own conclusions just by having the matter brought up and will not be satisfied with pablum. So thanks, Sean, for bringing it up, but get out of the way. Sooner or later somebody real will take your place. </p>

<p>Such negativity!  It breaks my heart; you&rsquo;re not gonna get anywhere like that.  But you&rsquo;re right, tangentially at least, they can not, and should not, be subject to second class citizenship.  Citizenship, afterall, is a privilege.</p>

<p>Engelman: &#8220;How do you intend to split this country apart? Southern states are most likely to split off. However, they have the largest black populations. Those blacks cannot be expelled. They cannot be subjected to second class citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: Why not?  </p>
<p>If this country continues into a severe depression civil war will eventually follow.  If that occurs&hellip;and every indication now is that the likelihood is greater than not&hellip;.tremendous purges and voluntary migrations will occur.</p>
<p>After a civil war this country won&rsquo;t even vaguely resemble this empire as it stands right now.</p>
<p>Too, there will be many areas that will secede, and if those areas are majority white, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a black living there. </p>
<p>And as to your claim that the South is most apt to secede, please note that those states comprising Cascadia and the area in the Northeast have groups actively working toward secession, as are many other states comprising various areas.</p>
<p>Part of the South could well be a black stronghold, having a large black population now, so they ARE NOT expected to secede.   And it is logical to consider that even more blacks might migrate there as a last ditch stand to fight off whitey.</p>
<p>To get a bit more knowledge on the subject you might want to read Tom Chittum&rsquo;s &#8220;Civil War II, The Coming Breakup of America.&#8221;<br>
He&rsquo;s been so accurate on so many of his forecasts what has not yet occurred probably will, close to what he describes.</p>

		<p>OMG, I cannot TELL you how many of these socalled &#8220;white privilege&#8221; lectures, conferences, forums, etc. ad nauseam, that we were FORCED to attend while in school for teaching credentials or masters&rsquo; in education, and then later when we were teachers in a barrio or ghetto area.

<p>Also, as another poster pointed out, white conservatives are too afraid to even approach the issue of race, and until they find their courage, nothing will change for us. Ever.</p>

		<p># 19 - Mike - No offense to fans but Hannity, Limbaugh and their ilk are worthless on race issues.</p>
<p> Limbaugh seems to be getting much better lately but Hannity is clueless and TERRIFIED to talk about race. After Obama won in &#8216;08 a BLACK caller told him that most blacks voted race and Hannity said &#8220;Oh no, they voted for Obama because he&rsquo;s a Democrat, blacks always vote Democrat!&#8221; So by that I gather he thinks McCain would&rsquo;ve gotten the black vote if he was Democrat!<br>
Also, to those of you that listen to Hannity on the radio, have you noticed how loooooong his commercial breaks are? I swear he has 30 min. of commercials for every hr. he&rsquo;s on! I&rsquo;ve turned him off on several occations because of commercial overload.  <br>

		<p>Our enemies are not non-whites. <br>
As much as we may resent them, or even want to expel them, they are not the real problem. The problem they pose is can easily be solved. </p>
<p>Our real enemies are white people. A concerted effort must be made to derail their programs, otherwise we are all doomed. <br>
Even if I may resent the behavior of so many non-whites, It is nothing compared to the rage created by their treasonous enablers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, while non-whites for the most part are an indiscernible chaotic mass of anonymous humanity, we all know the white traitors. <br>
A greater efforted must be made to expose them and/or remove them from whatever pulpit they may occupy. </p>
<p>One treasonous white does more harm to our people than a thousand non-whites! <br>
Their crimes are unforgiveable&hellip;</p>

		<p>If I have any white privilege at all it is because I was born with genes that made me somewhat smarter than the average black.  I won&rsquo;t apologize for that.  I belong to the only racial group that businesses, universities, and government not only may discriminate against but are often required to discriminate against.  Some privilege.  By and large white children behave in school and manage to learn things while black children act up and refuse to learn.  Somehow this deficiency among black children gets labeled &#8220;white privilege&#8221;.</p>

<p>In response to those who are disappointed about us needing a black man to speak the truth, I would only say that I believe the 5% of blacks who voted against Obama last election would likely make pretty good fellow citizens. If the other 95% would simply magically disappear back to Africa, the US would be well on it&rsquo;s way to becoming a decent country once again. For now, I welcome the 5%, who can help us enact a pro-white agenda.<br>

<p>Really? You think that the 5% number are really &#8220;pro-White&#8221;? Innis makes $$$ by being &#8220;on the White side&#8221; and gets media attention.  As for that 5% making good fellow citizens, no thank you. They would make good fellow citizens in Africa for their own African brethren.</p>
<p>When any White slobbers all over Allen West, Herman Cain, Rev. Manning, Bill Cosby, etc. they are part of the problem, not the solution. NO BLACK MAN is going to &#8220;help&#8221; us in our fight for survival. Take your blinders off.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; appears nowhere in this thread.  But that&rsquo;s a huge part of the problem here.  While the officers in the army arrayed against us may not be properly classified as white (depending on your definition), most of their foot soldiers and NCOs are.  They&rsquo;re &#8220;just following orders,&#8221; you see.  And they&rsquo;re Uncle Toms.  This is a great term because it turns a Politically-Correct pejorative back onto its designers.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid to call these sell-outs (this term won&rsquo;t bother them), race-traitors (neither will this one, they can be PC and proud of this one) and backstabbers (nope, still no sting) what they are: Uncle Toms (ouch!).</p>

		<p>My first thought was why is it acceptable to have a conference arguing about supposed white privilege, while the AR conferences which would provide information to the contrary are shut down?  How can you discuss the positions held by one conference when you&rsquo;re not allowed to have conferences that argue the opposite?</p>
<p>But I learned something here that AmRen might be well advised to take note of should it try to hold another conference.  AmRen conferences unfortunately do not have a title, which allows its opponents free rein to make up whatever they want about what the conference&rsquo;s purpose.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s a white supremacist/nationalist/racist, etc. meeting!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>But imagine the AmRen conferences were prominently titled something like &#8220;Ending reverse discrimination against whites&#8221;, &#8220;Ending race-based set-asides&#8221;, &#8220;Combating left-wing fascism&#8221; or &#8220;Combating the ADL and SPLC&#8221;  &mdash;  even though topics could still be about anything.  That would have at least three benefits  &mdash;  (1) it would no longer allow opponents to make up what the conference is about  &mdash;  racism, separatism, whatever  &mdash;  as it clear from the title the conference&rsquo;s purpose, and that is the title that newspapers would have to use (2) it would immediately put the ADL and SPLC and other Amren opponents in a laughable conflict-of-interest situation as they try to shut down the conference,  (How can SPLC argue, with a straight face, that a &#8220;Combating the SPLC and ADL&#8221; conference should be shut down)?, and (3) the title can be given in a way that most whites, and a good chunk of non-whites, would agree with the title&rsquo;s premise, making it that much harder to shut down the conference.  Imagine how much more white anger would have been aroused had the Charlotte Observer wrote about efforts to shut down a &#8220;Ending reverse discrimination against whites&#8221; conference instead of an-opponent named &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; conference.  I do fear AmRen is making a mistake with its title-less conferences.</p>

		<p>Imagine just for a moment, your tax dollars going for a conference combating Black Crime in the inner city, and for techniques that teachers can develop to deal with Black delinquency and violence?  There is no way in a thousand years, a public school system would get away with such a conference, even though it might be helpful to our schools and the safety of our students.  So how on earth can a conference on White privilege be justified.  It is a strange and imbalanced world that we live in.</p>

<p>I totally agree. NGO&rsquo;s (Ford Foundation) and Globalist Groups are leading the charge against Whites. South Africa was their 1st &#8220;experiment&#8221;&hellip;and the Model. </p>
