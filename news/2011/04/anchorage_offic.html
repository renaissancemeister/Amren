<h1>Anchorage Officer Charged With Passport Fraud</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Casey Grove, Anchorage Daily News, April 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a news conference Friday, U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler said that patrolman Rafael Espinoza, on the Anchorage police force for about six years, was really Rafael Mora-Lopez, a Mexican national working in the United States illegally.</p>
<p>The man known as Officer Espinoza  &mdash;  Mora-Lopez, in reality  &mdash;  was an excellent employee, Police Chief Mark Mew said. The investigation has so far not turned up any information that Mora-Lopez was involved in any other criminal activity outside the case announced Friday, Mew said.</p>
<p>&#8220;His problem was he lied his way into the job,&#8221; Mew said.</p>
<p>The identity swap was discovered when the police officer applied for a U.S. passport in January and officials from the State Department found that the Rafael Espinoza identity he was using was actually another person, a U.S. citizen in the Lower 48, Loeffler said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state Attorney General&rsquo;s office will be looking closely at cases Officer Espinoza investigated, said John Skidmore, supervisor of the department&rsquo;s Special Prosecutions Unit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Part of the ongoing investigation will look into how the Mexican national slipped through the screening process for Anchorage police officers, Mew said. For example, officers must pass a lie-detector test during the interview process, Mew said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wearing orange prison clothes, Mora-Lopez had tears in his eyes as court officers put him in handcuffs and led him from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was pretty proud to serve the community,&#8221; Mora-Lopez said as he shuffled out.<br>

		<p>While she was Governor, Sarah Palin endorsed the opening of a Mexican Consulate office in Anchorage, with the power to issue Matricula cards.  If this office had anything to do with this Mexican national illegal alien being able to pretend to be a cop for as long as he did, her Presidential ambitions should be over.</p>

		<p>You can imagine all the Alaska officials running around to soft-pedal this story to protect their backsides. Even the newspaper puff headline &#8220;Anchorage officer charged with passport fraud&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t come close to describing the most salient point.  </p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t that read &#8220;Illegal Alien Wears Police Uniform for Six Years&#8221;   </p>

		<p>ALL politicians are corrupt and anti-White, including Sarah Palin. You will NEVER hear one of them promote anything that would be considered pro-White in the real sense, they ALL pander to the nonwhites while stabbing us in the back. There is not one person that is running for office that I would vote for. EVERY single one I have voted for in the past, end up all the same, playing with OUR very lives!</p>

<p>YES, I would have to think that every case this guy has handled for the last SIX years would have to be thrown out in court. The man was not able to make arrests as he was not legally allowed to have police powers to begin with. Even if a sworn officer, his testimony would all be perjury as he had most likely lied on a lot of statements when he applied for the job. NOT just legal status.</p>
<p>This Nada Prouty and her sister Captain Spinelli were two illegal aliens in the country. Nada became post 9/11 an agent for both the FBI and the CIA. Captain Spinelli became a very highly thought of Marine Corps officer. At NO TIME were either of these &#8220;investigative&#8221; agencies able to determine that these two women were in the country illegally the whole time. Probably sent agents of hostile foreign power. </p>

		<p>Affirmative Action hire. He was hired because of his race pure and simple. Whoever hired him needs investigated too. Hope he spends a lot of time in jail and then gets deported back where he belongs.</p>

		<p>This may get thrown out of court. The supreme court decided that illegal aliens were exempt from prosecution for fraud and forged documents.</p>

<p>Enforcing this law that US born citizens must adhere to was among the easiest tools to provide a gateway for illegal-invader self-deportation before the Supremes not sold us out (again). One set of laws for you, another set of laws for invading populations. This seems unconstitutional to me.  </p>

I suspect there was another Hispanic within the Anchorage police department that aided and abetted this illegal invader along the way. Either that or his so called credentials were not scrutinized because doing so would be considered &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
