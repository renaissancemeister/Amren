<h1>Horde of Teens Attack, Rob MARTA Passengers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Boone, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, April 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Roughly two dozen teens, chanting the name of a well-known Atlanta gang, brought mob rule to MARTA early Sunday morning, overwhelming nervous passengers and assaulting two Delta flight attendants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There was blood everywhere, people were hollering and screaming,&#8221; a witness told Channel 2 Action News. &#8220;We were intimidated. People were terrified. People were trying to run. But there was nowhere to run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight attendant Parker Stanea, 28, told officers a diminutive teen, no taller than 5′4″ and wearing a pink shirt, hit him with a soda can over the left eye. Stanea said the youths then pushed him to the ground and stole his wallet, according to an incident report filed by MARTA police.</p>
<p>Stanea&rsquo;s friend, Jose Souza, said he was assaulted by the same suspect, according to the MARTA police incident report. The pink-clad teen punched him in the lip, the 24-year-old Delta employee said, but before they could take anything two unidentified male passengers intervened.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several passengers sought to exit at the next stop, but for some reason the doors at the West End station wouldn&rsquo;t open, leaving the passengers and suspects  &mdash;  believed to range in age from 13 to 18  &mdash;  in a tense face-off before the suspects disembarked at the Oakland City station.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they heard the youths chant &#8220;BFPL,&#8221; a familiar acronym to Atlanta police.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Atlanta Police Department is familiar with the &#8216;BFPL,&rsquo; a local gang made up of young people high-school aged and into their early 20s,&#8221; said APD spokesman Carlos Campos, adding the initials stand for &#8220;Bank First, Play Later.&#8221; The gang typically operates out of the southwest and northwest corners of Atlanta and came to the attention of police &#8220;mostly through a number of car break-ins for which some members were arrested,&#8221; Campos said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The attacks struck a nerve with some passengers who say they&rsquo;ve become increasingly concerned about their safety while riding MARTA.</p>

		<p>75 years ago, 100 after Sam Houston won Texas Independence from the Mexicans, the wonderful Margaret Mitchell blessed us with her great Pulitzer-Prize Winning Gone With the Wind.</p>
<p>In it, she called them &#8220;swarms of blacks&#8221;.  Go visit Atlanta, and you&rsquo;ll demand that the next reprinting of GWtW be updated with &#8220;hostile and dangerously anti-white swarms of blacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell was a pretty good chronicler, but not a good prophet.  We now suffer the future that Thaddeus Stevens and his mulatto housekeeper planned for us.</p>
<p>Every time a White girl in Penn. is robbed, raped, or murdered, we hold a séance in memory of Thaddeus Stevens.  We just hope his descendants suffer the most.<br>

<p>What troubles us most about the Internet Web 2.0 that allows comments, is that people feel free to voice their race realist frustrations.  </p>
<p>When others who have same feelings see racist comments, they feel part of an oppressed and marginalized White Community.  They feel free to make little, subtle comments to their White friends and co workers to probe for like minded true men.</p>
<p>Ocassionally, we connect and become friends with other very concerned Whites.  That is &#8220;hate&#8221; to the SPLC, ADL, and NAACP, and especially the Obama-Holder DOJ, which will never protect &#8220;our people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because of the White Unity that comment sections inspire, you can be sure that very powerful forces, the unmentionable ethnic solidifies, are now planning on how to outlaw free speech (truth speech) from the Internet.</p>
<p>They simply will not tolerate the free flow of native prejudice and group unity for our White Humanity.   Just wait- you will look back on your blog comments freedoms with the same curiosity as you feel when you look at pictures of dinosaurs and dodo birds.<br>

		<p>Seems like there&rsquo;s been a steady rise in this behavior since Obama became president. I wonder why. Are blacks feeling bolder these days to come out and assault those they&rsquo;ve disliked all along, like the Hutus of Rwanda suddenly coming out with their machetes?</p>

		<p>I once was stranded in Atlanta overnight due to a miss flight connection when traveling from Orlando to San Jose. I asked an attendant at the airport if it was safe to take MARTA to an overnight hotel. The attendant probably thought I was black due to my dark skin and said &#8220;for you, yes&#8221;. I thought about it and decided to fork over the money and take a cab instead. Now, I&rsquo;m sure glad I did!. Those blacks would have probably eaten me alive for being an &#8220;oreo&#8221; (a black person that acts white).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t doubt the Metro Link makes things worse, but don&rsquo;t forget that the ghetto starts very near The Loop.  So there are plenty of black troublemakers within very short walking distance of The Loop and all its establishments.  Too, that ML station has been there since 1994, the first ML leg opening.  The newest extension and its stop near The Galleria is directly responsible for so many black youth fights at that mall.</p>
<p>What got my goat is that there was so much St. Louis and University City Police presence on The Loop to make life safe for those precious white liberals to swill booze, not having to fear the diversity they love so much, that a lot of cops were drained away from the south half of the city on Saturday.  (I found that out from SLPOA Cop Talk.)  That left the field clear for four aspiring neurosurgeons to beat up those two elderly Vietnamese, killing the man.</p>
<p>But hold on to your hat, it&rsquo;s going to get worse.  The SLPOA just caved on local control.  Meaning the SLPD is about to be run in essence by all the black cracker jack box theology degree black preachers.  RIP, law enforcement.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The attacks struck a nerve with some passengers who say they&rsquo;ve become increasingly concerned about their safety while riding MARTA.&#8221;</p>
<p>One might want to correlate their safety, not within the confines of MARTA, but their proximity to blacks.</p>
<p>Where are all those pro-gun &#8220;Sons of the South&#8221; that we always hear about?  In the Detroit suburbs those blacks would have got pummeled or shot in 9 out of 10 suburban cities in the metro Detroit area if they would have tried this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was blood everywhere, people were hollering and screaming,&rdquo; a witness told Channel 2 Action News. &ldquo;We were intimidated. People were terrified. People were trying to run. But there was nowhere to run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten teens can kill you just as easy (if not easier) than two or three adults.  FIGHT BACK!  There is no shame in losing, as long as you try.  And if blacks knew you would fight tooth and nail and still lose this would happen so much less, it would result in too many &#8220;Pyrrhic victories&#8221;.  They attack because we do not fight back.</p>
<p>It is like watching a nature show and wondering why a two ton Wildebeest just doesn&rsquo;t kick the Cheetah in the head or trample it.  We all know that it would kill the cheetah in an instant, but instead the sleeping giant tucks tail and runs. </p>

		<p>Peejay in San Francisco, remember when the black San Francisco kids were doing this on the buses?  The mostly black bus drivers started carrying baseball bats.  They also refused to let black kids on the bus.  The black kids started so many fires on buses that the drivers bought those little home fire extinguishers and carried them along with the baseball bats.</p>

<p>The Buffalo News was so concerned that they now require people to register with their name and address (which is verified before you&rsquo;re allowed to post). All comments appear with your name, city, and state.</p>
<p>The result has been a major loss in on-line comments and I strongly suspected, online readership. I never registered and I try to limit my viewing of the Buffalo News online.</p>
<p>The editor, Margaret Sullivan, wrote an editorial after the changes. She tried to make it sound like everything was just fine but everyone knows it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>She boasted that the Buffalo News was one of the first online newspapers to make this change and she said, with a straight face, many others are considering doing the same!</p>
<p>The policy has been a failure and Ms. Sullivan knows it. I don&rsquo;t know of any other online newspaper that has followed the lead of the Buffalo News. I suspect most newspapers are well aware of the lose of online readers and won&rsquo;t be making such changes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting is how many of the people who do post comments who don&rsquo;t live in Buffalo or even New York state. Comments are coming in from Texas, California, Florida, and Virginia. </p>

<p>This was intentional, no doubt. </p>
<p>In his autobiography, Abraham Lincoln recalled that at the age of 19 he and a friend were swarmed and beaten by a group of seven black males. </p>
<p>When I was in high school 40 years ago, it was common for black students to swarm and beat white students. </p>
<p>This racist behavior has been going on as long as Africa has been in our midst.</p>

<p>I must respond to this blatant Wildebeast defamation. Wildebeast do not weigh 2 tons (4000 Lbs.); adults weigh between 300 to 600 lbs. Adults are not preyed upon by cheetahs, only young seperated from protective adults. Packs of lions and hyenas will prey on  adults, but choose the weak and sick, not the strong and healthy. </p>
<p>The degenerate behavior of the whites on the MARTA train, would never occur among normal wildebeast. </p>

		<p>And just think, Georgia got rid of its state emblem bearing the confederate battle flag, and this happens!!  Probably feelings of residual oppression by blacks unknowingly reacting from years of seeing the battle flag from 1954 until it was changed recently.  </p>
<p>Oh well, things will settle down when that memory fades among blacks in say&hellip;another 500 years.  In the meantime we can be assured of the joy of going to the Atlanta ballparks and marvel at marginal black affleeaks trying to catch a ball. </p>

It&rsquo;s popular for black youths from the city of Atlanta to explode into violence on buses and trains.</p>
<p>Black youths will exploit the opportunity to exact a crime when a situation is lucrative.</p>
<p>Black youths are inspired by scuttlebutt from their parents to pursuade them to view whites as less than human.</p>
<p>The most vicious range from ages 13-18.</p>
<p>Whites like you who fight back are often probed more closely by police and should carry a video camera on your person or mounted on a firearm.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt that the attendant thought you were a black.  Dark skinned Indians do NOT look like blacks, and they speak like whites, as you well know.  Probably the attendant meant you might be o.k. to travel among blacks simply because you did not have white&hellip;or light&hellip;skin.  Blacks will often excuse straight hair, as opposed to kinky hair, if the person is a person of color, with the exception of Hispanics whom they generally dislike.  </p>
<p>But that all depends on what kind of propaganda they&rsquo;ve been fed prior to seeing you.  If they knew how Indians outperform them academically, they would probably attack you as well.  Most of their hatred of whites is based in jealousy.</p>
<p>Too, I&rsquo;ve read other posts from you wherein you alluded to the fact that your skin is darker than some blacks with the inferrance that you believe whites oppose blacks solely due to skin color.  That&rsquo;s not true either.  Whites oppose blacks for their propensity for crime and violence; their naturally loud and rude behavior, but mostly because of their stupidity and troublemaking.</p>
<p>I have to say the Indians I&rsquo;ve been in contact with do not have those traits, so for most whites your skin color is not a problem.  But most whites, like most Indians, I imagine, want to continue their lines without mixing with other races.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the way most races feel, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

		<p>I am so thankful it wasn&rsquo;t a gang of whites attacking blacks there is nothing worse than RACISM in America as we all know.<br>
At least there was no racism involved here?</p>
<p>I can almost see the headline now, Atlanta Police have determined there was no racial motivation in this attack, in fact the whites brought it on themselves thinking they had the right to use Public Transportation.</p>

		<p> Wonder what kind of &#8220;teens&#8221; these were? The usual blond, blue-eyed Swedes, probably. You know how bad they are in Atlanta.</p>
<p> But seriously, folks, can you believe the Atlanta Journal-Constitution tap-danced around the ethnicity of these thugs? Yes, of course, if you&rsquo;re familiar with the Journal-Constitution, or most other big-city newspapers nowadays, you can believe it.</p>
<p> Notice, though that the reporter Christian Boone supplied a few hints that would give the game away to Atlantans (if there was any doubt in the minds of any of them what color these punks were). I&rsquo;m sure the acronym &#8220;BFPL&#8221; is familiar to most Atlantans, and that &#8220;southwest and northwest corners of Atlanta&#8221; is a dead giveaway to anyone who knows the various neighborhoods. Kind of like the New York Daily News (for example) reporting on a gang attack on a subway, not identifying the &#8220;youffs&#8221; by race, but noting that were seen &#8220;fleeing into Harlem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I for one have no qualms about beating, stabbing or shooting a punk teen of any color attacking me. Attacking another person marks that teen as a legitimate target for lethal retaliation. The only way to stop this is for whites especially to start killing them them moment they attack, or maiming them so they can never harm someone ever again.</p>

Before the civil rights movement whites were free to express their perceptions and feelings about blacks. Now blacks have equal rights. Despite expensive efforts to bring them up to the mark, they lag behind in performance and behavior. That indicates that the prejudice against them was based on sound instinct. The prejudice persists because black social pathology persists. I do not believe it will be possible much longer for the Thought Police to suppress the fee expression liberals claim to champion. </p>

		<p>I am concerned about why the automatic doors did not open. This could have been a premeditated attack,assisted by friends of the hoods who worked at Marta. Even savage psycophathic thugs have reasons for what they do. Did they assault these stewards because they knew they might be drug mules; was it a planned gay bashing; there is some reason why they picked out these people. These creeps were stopped by passengers who most likely were black. This doesn`t feel like a &#8221; Wilding &#8221; thing. It could have been a turf war declaration. The chanted their gang name to let the lovely world of Atlanta gangdom know that this section of Marta was their territory. Most of these thoughts will not be investigated by Atlanta`s cops since they are headed by black administrators who don`t want the black majority to know that gangs are out of control on the black lifeline in the state capitol. There can be few fates worse than being a decent hard working black person forced to live in a city ruled by black hustlers in coat and ties.<br>

		<p>Re several comments on whether blacks are behaving even more badly since Obama&rsquo;s election:  I agree that one reason is that they have become emboldened.  I&rsquo;m constantly reminded of scenes not only in Gone With the Wind, but in Birth of a Nation as well.  I also believe, however, that many blacks are acting up because they&rsquo;re disappointed and frustrated that Obama hasn&rsquo;t thrown all the whites out of government, initiated reparations, and given all blacks a free house and luxury car.  The &#8220;most powerful man in the world&#8221; is now a black, and still whitey has the upper hand, for all practical purposes.  </p>

<p>The problem I see here is that a 28 year old white man can&rsquo;t handle a little punk kid. All real men have a responsibility to know how to defend themselves and those around them - physically and non-physically, with and without weapons, and against multiple attackers. In this day and age there is no excuse. Groups of wild black kids have a pack mentality, once they see weakness and fear in a potential victim they&rsquo;ll all attack but, conversely, if the target stands up and faces down the alphas, or better yet, causes them to cry out in pain, the rest will back down out of fear.  Blacks are natural cowards that don&rsquo;t know how to fight and rely on numbers, phony bluster, and the suckerpunch.  You only have to worry when they have firearms but even then they are terrible shots with no concept of tactics. Never let them intimidate you and never backdown.</p>

		<p>@Seneca  You are right, I never understood why people dont try to fight back, especially if one kid was only about 5&rsquo;4&#8221; and probably only 120 pounds. I have to wonder if all of the zero tolerance stuff where if there is any sort of &#8220;fight&#8221; both parties are equally punished. If you watch any of the recent videos posted on youtube where a person is attacked, even by one person, you will see that they immediatly put their arms up into a submissive pose and do not make any attempt to defend themselves. It is so pathetic. </p>

		<p>The massive whining in Atlanta about the lack of attendance supporting its sports teams (Braves, Falcons &amp; Hawks) will never once mention the most ACCURATE reason for it: all venues are placed squarely in the middle of ghettoville, with an advertised emphasis on doing away with public parking to promote the use of MARTA. (&#8216;Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta is indeed the correct slang used by whites.)</p>
<p>Whites from the suburbs are typically the primary purchasers of sporting tickets, and the majority of them now refuse to abandon their cars and be at the mercy of trains and buses into the ghetto. Our family, along with countless others we know simply quit attending (in our case) Braves baseball games the day they demolished the old stadium, which had plenty of parking, to be replaced by the Olympic Stadium, which has none. Riding Marta involves a death wish.</p>
<p>The new AAA Braves team has relocated to the suburbs, in Gwinnett county and is enjoying a huge attendance, as it is (up to now) a majority white location. Just give it time and it, too, will be a danger zone for whites.</p>

<p>Did these two black girls, the new leaders and icons of the Civil Rights movement, these heroines who are just increasing the intensity at guarding the change, get their marching orders from the DOJ, or rap music, or did they attend an anti-White Privilege conference and become incited to justified violence against Whites?</p>

<p>Anyone who knows anything is aware of the fact that all bad black behaviour is a result of something whites have done to bring it on. Blacks are never to blame for anything they do. And it seems to me they never do much of value? I wonder if they are still laying on the street corners in New Orleans waiting for the white folks to bring them the help they so richly deserve?</p>
<p>I read today where our beloved Jesse Jackson is being sued by a male who worked for him the worker has alleged that Mr Jackson (Jesse not Michael) forced him to provide or sex from time to time? They don&rsquo;t call this being gay, they call this Getting It on The Down Low and it is quite common among black males (in and out of prison)?</p>

		<p>The fact that whites do not, generally resist, or resist well, attacks by blacks, is not due to each individual&rsquo;s failings.  I think we are conditioned to fear the inevitable community response if we do.  Integrated mobs led by preachers, community activists, and crying women, seconded by outraged members of the political and intellectual classes, escorted by police, and accompanied by looters, are the inevitable follow on to successful white resistance.  When there is a better sense among whites that the white community will rise up in response, then you will see more fighting back on the individual level.     </p>

		<p>Those who advocate White self defense should remember Bernie Goetz, a White hero who was destroyed by the city of New york district attorney, mayor etc.</p>
<p>It was 1984.  From about 1960 till 1995 the black thugs ruled New York.  Many Whites fled because of the rapes, murders and robberies.  Those who remained could not defend themselves because of Al Sharpton and a corrupt White city government that pandered to blacks.  Bernie got tired of it and began to carry a gun.  One day 3 black predators flourished sharpened screwdrivers and knives and demanded money.</p>
<p>Bernie shot them.  I think Bernie went to jail for a while.  The obscenity of a New York Times, ADL/ACLU/AJC/NOW/SPLC and the local government went on a rampage of vilification of Bernie Goetz. The liberals claimed that he just shot down the innocent black children who only meant to ask him if they could &#8220;borrow&#8221; some money.</p>
<p>I am an extreme, extreme White nationalist, not only against our non White enemies but even more so against our own White elites who plan our genocide.  I hate, hate to say this, but it is really better for Whites to submit of a 15 minute beating by a few blacks rather than be sent to prison for defending oneself and being beaten and raped by black guards and prisoners for years.</p>
<p>By the way, all those victims of crime programs that supposedly provide medical care and lost wages for victims of crime?</p>
<p>Like virtually all government benefits, Whites can apply but Whites never get the benefit.  Probably because the government employees who administer the victims of crime benefits are minority women who hate Whites.</p>
<p>Just as German police stood by while Jews were beaten in public places in the early 1930&rsquo;s, so will black police, district attorneys and even medical personnel stand by as Whites are beaten to death by Whites.</p>

They looked at that guitar like it was a piece of meat. It was strange: they were so vacuous, but I could tell they&rsquo;d flail at me in a second if they thought they had the chance.<br>
 I gave a very cold stare to the oldest one (probably fourteen, but as big as an adult), and the stare said &#8221; I know exactly what you&rsquo;re thinking, and you&rsquo;re going to have to fight real hard to get this guitar.&#8221; The punk couldn&rsquo;t meet my gaze.

You have NO RIGHT to force your &#8216;occasional love&rsquo; for foreign culture onto the rest of us be it one, two or in your words, &#8220;twenty&#8221; which as any American knows, leads to the complete annihilation of their once Beloved American Community.</p>
<p>You make me sick.  It is because of Traitors like you that we are now forced to deal with indian owned hotels, Dunkin&rsquo; you know what and foreign owned gas stations to name a few problems not to mention our ever so beneficial depressed wages that your Beloved &#8220;occasional&#8221; Third World Immigrant have brought us.</p>
<p>Shall I speak of all the very destructive bugs those few precious and vibrant immigrants have brought as well?  You may not mind losing crops or Trees due from bugs from The East but I do.  If you will pardon for me saying, you have NO RIGHT to force Third World Culture nor Third World Bugs unto me. </p>

		<p>You need the equivalent of Sky Marshals or perhaps &#8216;Guardian Angels&rsquo; (licensed private security, armed and trained&hellip;) so that there are 1-2 incidents in which the right people stand up with the correct weapons.</p>
<p>And a pair of cuffs.</p>
<p>And the blacks find somewhere else to go because this avenue is shut down.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a high cost affair so probably cannot be maintained for long.  Once you get these BFPL on the run, you have to keep them that way.  I imagine there is already video on this train but if not, there should be and it should be ultra high definition at both the doors and down the aisle.</p>
<p>Everyone who rides should probably have to pay a one-time fee for a biometric ID train-pass, after which they simply get it &#8216;recharged&rsquo; like one of those purchaseable credit cards, once a month or yearly.</p>
<p>Someone who is a legal rider has to flash or swipe their ID as they go through the turnstyle, which takes a picture of their face and the picture on the card in the same moment.</p>
<p>If they later get into trouble on the train, BAM.  You have them on triple layered surveillance:  High rez video.  High rez digital image and the marked card.</p>
<p>And yes, I think it&rsquo;s -just so great- (sarcasm) that I am actually suggesting means to set up a police state to &#8216;solve the problem&rsquo; of a little robbery and gay bashing by blacks.</p>

I am an extreme, extreme White nationalist, not only against our non White enemies but even more so against our own White elites who plan our genocide. I hate, hate to say this, but it is really better for Whites to submit of a 15 minute beating by a few blacks rather than be sent to prison for defending oneself and being beaten and raped by black guards and prisoners for years.<br>
Like virtually all government benefits, Whites can apply but Whites never get the benefit. Probably because the government employees who administer the victims of crime benefits are minority women who hate Whites.<br>
Just as German police stood by while Jews were beaten in public places in the early 1930&rsquo;s, so will black police, district attorneys and even medical personnel stand by as Whites are beaten to death by Whites.&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Hey there&hellip;you sound like a troll to me.<br>
many of your statements make you sound like a total impostor.<br>
You are an &#8220;extreme extreme&#8221; WN, yet you start your post by advising would-be victims to think twice before defending themselves from violence or abuse. <br>
What are smoking?</p>
<p>You sound like a lefty university creep, as your ranting attempts to come off as informed&hellip;</p>
<p>First off, Goetz was acquitted by a N.Y jury of the shootings, but did spend less than a year for unlawful firearm possession. Second, the entire city rallied behind him in support, fed up as it was of the rampant street crime. </p>
<p>&#8220;A fifteen minute beating over prison time&#8221;&hellip;you are definitely a lefty troll, only a lefty would try dress up something so ludicrous with some kind of flawed logic!</p>
<p>No white person should ever tolerate mistreatment of any kind, and further, no white person should stand idle while another white person is being mistreated.<br>

		<p>@55 SS,</p>
<p>I agree with your interpretation of a zero tolerance immigration policy for two reasons:</p>
<p>1.  If they come, they will want to bring at least a bride and they will, if India is any example, also need brides and husbands for at least 4 and as many as 8 resulting children.  Whether they come from us or come from India that is an exponential, never ending, threat to our genes and our way.</p>
<p>2.  To have to explain &#8216;why&rsquo; is more than most can intelligently do, particularly given we have been lied to for so long by our leaders and their lapdogs in the MSM as to just how poorly behaved and lacking in intelligence most ethnics are.  There is a reason why a collective will: &#8220;_Just because that&rsquo;s the way it is!!_&#8221; is the easiest to enunciate as a justification: it is an ingrained habit whose prejudice is global rather than specific to the moment (&#8220;If Rajesh, why not Mohammed?&#8221;).  Ans: Neither may come.</p>
<p>Nations like Saudi Arabia which have a zero tolerance rule for Jews or Christians and -any- ethnic (including muslims) not there on a temporary work permit, are able to stay the way they are _for centuries_ because they subliminalize their accurate interpretations of preference.  It&rsquo;s not hate.  It&rsquo;s preference.</p>
<p>Having said this, if we will not allow in cheap ethnic labor, we must replace what they do in fields which are low profitability or high toil &#8216;unpleasant&rsquo; to whites.  So that working class whites can gain more from doing it and not feel like they are on a lesser social rung.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple.  The jobs are still there, it is still necessary to do them.</p>
<p>Robotics are the way to go to get those replacements.  They give a farmer 10 field hands able to do stoop labor or drive a combine with equal acumen, &#8216;20 seconds worth of download away&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>They let a &#8216;janitorial staff&rsquo; run 4-5 buildings, maintaining the highly technical droid rather than doing the mopping and garbage dumping that a robot is there constantly (24:7:365) to take care of.  The Janitor then gets the SALARY of 4-5 robots or 100K a year.  Being a Janitorial Maintenance person sound so bad now?  Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>The thing most people don&rsquo;t realize is that you can make a brain surgeon that is dumber than a cosmetician because the cosmetician has to set you at ease while they do your manicure.  The brain surgeon simply has to cut with millimetric precision.  And machines beat humans in that, 100%.</p>
<p>And making robots is _easy_, as an act of physical engineering, and need not be hard (in the first generations) as an act of software sophistication compliance.  Because they will ALL be overseen by expert managers.</p>
<p>To get there, quickly, we just have to limit their &#8216;ontological topology&rsquo;: their universal map awareness of who they are, what they are to do and where they are to do it.</p>
<p>Drive them to the worksite and turn them on to acquire and start picking the cabbages or whatever.  And you have, by that simple act, PROVEN how much smarter you are than they.  Because you know where you are, where the worksite is and how to obey the rules of the road in getting there.</p>
<p>We need never fear a &#8216;Terminator&rsquo; or &#8216;I-Robot&rsquo; scenario under these conditions because the robots have no reason to know that they are &#8216;expert&rsquo; rather than sentient.</p>
<p>What is more important, if we ACKNOWLEDGE the terrible harm that &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is doing to our culture, at a level where &#8220;That&rsquo;s ours, just leave it be!&#8221; is the only excuse necessary; we also don&rsquo;t have to justify it to every liberal egalitarian because those aren&rsquo;t the ones in power.  If we have robots to replace the hard manual labor, we take away the reason that the true power brokers in industry and commerce want these cheap lemming hordes as worker-consumers.</p>
<p>Cheap Salaries.  Nothing is cheaper than free.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Because when Saudi hits the back end of her oil production curve around 2015, just at the time China is standing up a dominant (largest growth market on the planet) industrial and automobile culture, having a &#8216;service economy&rsquo; will no longer be such a great idea, simply to gain maximum currency flow from a huge workforce.</p>
<p>Smaller populations will mean more residual resources for all of us who REMAIN LOYAL to the intrinsic evolutionary advantages of being white: conservatism and planning for the future as a function of work excellence, both personal and professional.</p>
<p>We must save ourselves because no one else will.  And we cannot do that solely by excluding the ethnies which destroy us.  We must replace them.  And we must make it worth our while to do so.</p>

<p>The problem I see here is that a 28 year old white man can&rsquo;t handle a little punk kid. All real men have a responsibility to know how to defend themselves and those around them - physically and non-physically, with and without weapons, and against multiple attackers. In this day and age there is no excuse.</p>
<p>******************</p>
<p>Be realistic!   This flight attendant was on his way to the airport,  no doubt  to catch a plane. The last thing he needed on his way to work was to get into a fight with a bunch of teenage thugs.</p>
<p>And incidentally, why would you assume he was white?   Judging from his rather odd name, I would guess that he was not white either.</p>

		<p>    I support Rajesh. To me and a lot of us westerners despise the behaviour not the skin color. if African Americans were better behaved as a whole we wouldn&rsquo;t have this site. <br>
   Having met many from the Indian community I must admit that their lifestyle is commendable. It may be that the best ones are the ones that come to the U.S. but I never worry about being around a bunch of Indian youths.<br>
     While researching the ancient Aryans I read a post that surmised that the genes of the original Aryan settlers of India has been extremely diluted but the lasting impression has been cultural. And I must agree that many Indians in the U.S. seem very European like in their thinking, behaviour and outlook.<br>
     It is a mistake to think whiteness is proof of proper and sound mentality for a good community member, and so it is a mistake to think that a dark person does not have it either.<br>
     Also, South Indians who are very dark are not genetically related to Africans even though many only lack the kinky hair, nor are they culturally connected to Black culture.<br>
    So please lets not be so harsh toward Rajesh and others including blacks that recognize what we also see and have the same concerns.  <br>

<p>Teens?  Do they mean teens like in &#8220;Happy Days&#8221;?  So Ritchie, Ralph, and Potsie went on a rampage - gettin&rsquo; up in people&rsquo;s faces, and puttin&rsquo; the beat-down on them?</p>
<p>Oh, they were black teens, also known as &#8220;youths&#8221;, and undoubtedly members of a vibrant &#8220;community&#8221;.  Well that explains it.  Let&rsquo;s just all pretend it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
