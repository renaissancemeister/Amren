			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hearing on homeland security descended into a heated and angry dispute after an Arab-American activist testified that she was taught as a youngster to &#8216;hate Jews&rsquo; and &#8216;hate America&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The debate over Islamic terror turned into a shouting match as Nonie Darwish, director of Former Muslims United, spoke at the State Senate committee meeting in New York.</p>
<p>One senator gripped a Koran in his and accused the human rights activist of spreading &#8216;hate and poison&rsquo; at the hearing held to study how vulnerable New York City is to another act of terror ten years after September 11.</p>
<p>&#8216;Check what&rsquo;s going on, it&rsquo;s not a secret&rsquo; said Ms Darwish, who was educated in Egypt and came to the U.S. in 1978.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8216;The education of Arab children is to make killing of certain groups of people not only good, it&rsquo;s holy,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is horrendous. They don&rsquo;t leave your mind to think for itself. You&rsquo;re supposed to hate Jews. You&rsquo;re supposed to hate America. You&rsquo;re supposed to hare Western culture.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Senator Eric Adams, a Brooklyn Democrat, interrupted, holding up a copy of the Koran</p>
<p>9/11: Ten years after September 11 attack, the State Senate in New York is holding hearings to study how vulnerable the city is to another act of terror</p>
<p>&#8216;This is offending this hearing by having her here. This is not our enemy. You&rsquo;re bringing hate, hate and poison into a diverse country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Committee chairman Greg Ball, a Putnam Republican, told Mr Adams to be quiet and suggested he was playing to the TV cameras.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m glad no one is between those TV cameras and you because that&rsquo;s the most dangerous place in New York City right now,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>The shouting match frustrated some lawmakers. Senator Martin Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said: &#8216;I want to get back to what this is all about. Homeland security is about the future of this city and this state, to make sure that we&rsquo;re safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Senator Marty Golden, another Brooklyn Republican, added: &#8216;This, obviously, is her assessment, how she was brought up in life. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the good Muslim Americans who live in this country.&rsquo;<br>

Do not believe what the Muslims say in those videos taken just before they go on their suicide terrorist missions.<br>
Do not believe what is written in the Koran.<br>

Do not believe what this Muslim woman (Nonie Darwish) says.</p>

		<p>Another reason for banning all immigration from Muslim-majority countries.  </p>
<p>When Pastor Terry Jones burnt the Koran, he may have done the world a favor.  Now the US will have a harder time in Afghanistan, so hopefully we will withdraw money and precious American patriotic soldiers from the 12th century.</p>
<p>Even many pro-war conservatives are realizing it is impossible to transform Afghanistan into a Japan or Germany.  Now we have 4-star general begging an unknown pastor to refrain from exercising his free speech rights so that peace can be restored 5,000 miles away.  We need to bomb the Middle East to pieces and leave.  The region&rsquo;s inhabitants cannot be civilized.</p>

		<p>Here we have someone who knows, talking about real &#8220;diversity&#8221;, but the Brooklyn senators can only put their fingers in their ears and sing &#8220;la-la-la, stop the hate-hate-hate&#8221;, without ever admitting the true source of real hatred.  Senator Adams, who probably cringes at the mention of the Bible, instead holds up a Koran to drown out the truth.  The good senators are &#8220;offended&#8221; by having &#8220;hate&#8221; mentioned in a discussion about national security against an enemy who hates us.  The ultimate &#8220;good&#8221; of diversity (though without knowing exactly why it&rsquo;s so good) trumps even the evils brought in by said diversity.  It is indeed a mental disorder, and the senators should be removed for reasons of poor mental health.</p>

		<p>Wake up, America!!  Islam is out to take over this country by any means necessary.  They are out to take over the whole world!  This is their stated objective - it&rsquo;s no secret.  &#8220;Moderate&#8221; Muslims are forced to cooperate with jihad Muslims because the latter threaten the former&rsquo;s lives if they don&rsquo;t.  Therefore there is no such thing as a &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslim.  Don&rsquo;t believe it?  You better go do your homework - start with the &#8220;Act For America&#8221; site.  Do some reading.  If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll deserve what the Muslims will give you, which is death.</p>

Country singer Merle Haggard wrote a song in 1970.<br>
Its lyrics reflect what every politician should know.</p>
<p>Because if the politicians were moral with the American people, America would not have the immigration policies that caused 9/11.</p>
<p>The song is called The Fightin&rsquo; Side of Me.</p>
<p><br>
I hear people talkin&rsquo; bad,<br>
About the way we have to live here in this country,<br>
Harpin, on the wars we fight,<br>
An, gripin&rsquo; &#8216;bout the way things oughta be.<br>
An, I don&rsquo;t mind &#8216;em switchin&rsquo; sides,<br>
An&rsquo; standin&rsquo; up for things they believe in.<br>
When they&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; down my country, man,<br>
They&rsquo;re walkin&rsquo; on the fightin&rsquo; side of me.<br>
Yeah, walkin&rsquo; on the fightin&rsquo; side of me.<br>
Runnin&rsquo; down the way of life,<br>
Our fightin&rsquo; men have fought and died to keep.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t love it, leave it:<br>
Let this song I&rsquo;m singin&rsquo; be a warnin&rsquo;.<br>
If you&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; down my country, man,<br>
Your&rsquo;e walkin&rsquo; on the fightin&rsquo; side of me.</p>
<p>I read about some squirrely guy,<br>
Who claims&rsquo; he just don&rsquo;t believe in fightin&rsquo;.<br>
An&rsquo; I wonder just how long,<br>
The rest of us can count on bein&rsquo; free.<br>
They love our milk an&rsquo; honey,<br>
But they preach about some other way of livin&rsquo;.<br>
When they&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; down my country, hoss,<br>
They&rsquo;re walkin&rsquo; on the fightin&rsquo; side of me.</p>
<p>Yeah, walkin&rsquo; on the fightin&rsquo; side of me.<br>
Runnin&rsquo; down the way of life,<br>

		<p>Its true, not all Muslims want us dead.  But before I get flamed, hear me out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 20% of all Muslims hate us (I know its higher).  Now we will let in one million Muslims.  Now think about it, 200,000 people just walked into the U.S. legally that want us to die.</p>
<p>It should not be a case of &#8220;not all&#8221; or &#8220;only a few&#8221;, it does not matter.</p>
<p>Anything over 0% is too much.</p>
<p>There is a saying of throwing the baby out with the bath water, but this is not a good analogy for this topic.</p>
<p>Think of it as drinking a glass with 80% water and 20% poison.  You&rsquo;ll only get a little poisoned, right?</p>

		<p>   If 9-11 won&rsquo;t convince them, what will ? We are literally waist deep in liberal mish-mash . </p>
<p>   I am certain that the Founding Fathers planned having a Mosque on every corner. What could be more American, right ? </p>
<p>  That little altercation off the Barbary Coast concerning Muslim pirates was just a cultural misunderstanding . Who was the guy who said, &#8220;Millions for defense, not one red cent for tribute?&#8221; Obviously a Tea Partying, right wing extremist . And the Marine song about &#8221; the shores of Tripoli?&#8221; They were just celebrating diversity . Yeah, that&rsquo;s it, diversity . </p>

		<p>&#8220;Muslims are taught to hate America&#8221;</p>
<p>The strange fact is, despite their hatred of America, they line up in their millions outside US embassies for the chance of foisting themselves on America.<br>
 In fact there are very few depths they will not sink to in order to gain entry to the country they profess to despise, some heterosexuals in a culture that despises homosexuality have even claimed to gay in order to curry favor with the PC crowd.</p>

<p>OK, then explain why the USA spends a Billion Dollars a year on Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, Airport security, building security, and thousands of other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, all trained and tasked with identifying terrorists and preventing internal, domestic terrorist threats.  </p>
<p>If it has nothing to do with Muslims, why do we spend a Billion Dollars a year monitoring USA Muslims?  That guy is an idiot.</p>

		<p>US blacks are in AMAZING denial about the attitudes of arabs and other muslim toward blacks:</p>
<p>on my return flight from europe yesterday, a very pleasant black woman professor regaled me with tales of black resistance to slavery in the US, but when I mentioned that european police departments have to create anti slavery divisions TODAY because so many arabs are showing up in europe with ther BLACK slaves in tow, she just stared at me as thgough I were speaking chinese.</p>
<p>slavery in the US 150 years ago seems very topical to US blacks, black slaves owned by muslims TODAY is just plain boring.   </p>
<p>where does she thinks blacks are treated better:</p>
<p>in the US, where she is a tenured professor traveling to paris on vacation?</p>
<p>or in the arab world, where blacks are treated worse than animals??</p>

		<p>The lying politicians tell us there is absolutely no danger to importing millions of Muslims into the USA.  At the same time, the United States spends an incredible $56 billion annually on Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Homeland Security was created in direct response to the Muslim attacks on 9/11.  Yet, politicians say we have nothing to fear from Muslims.  Who is lying?  Who has to pay for this insanity?   </p>
<p>If the Muslims whom our government imported are no threat, then why are we taxed to pay $56 billion a year for Homeland Security?</p>
