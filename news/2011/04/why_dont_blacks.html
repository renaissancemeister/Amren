<h1>Why Don&rsquo;t Blacks Save More?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Young, Reuters, April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Yet another survey confirms what we already know: Blacks don&rsquo;t save as much as their white counterparts.</p>
<p>According to Prudential&rsquo;s new study  &mdash;  the African American Financial Experience  &mdash;  60 percent of African-Americans have less than $50,000 in company retirement plans and only 23 percent have more than $100,000. They&rsquo;re also three times more likely to raid their 401(k) or other retirement plans to meet immediate financial needs, the study says.</p>
<p>Prudential&rsquo;s findings echo research by Ariel Investments, which looks at middle class blacks.  (According to Ariel&rsquo;s July 2010 study, the median assets blacks have retirement plans is about half the amount that whites have accumulated: $56,000 compared to $106,000.)</p>
<p>This issue has not gone unnoticed in corporate boardrooms. One company that is trying to narrow the retirement savings gap among minority workers is McDonald&rsquo;s, which uses some unconventional (along with very traditional) methods to get black and Latino employees to save for retirement.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t blacks save more? Experts say African-Americans distrust the financial system because it has excluded them for so long. In fact, 78 percent of respondents to the Prudential survey said they feel financial services companies &#8220;have not effectively engaged the African-American community.&#8221; Most of them do not use or have access to financial advisers.</p>

		<p>I think this goes back to something Schopenhauer said all those years ago. While sub-Saharan Africa does have drought and floods, the weather is generally warm year-round. One does not have to contend with snow. On the other hand, Europeans and Asians were forced in their nascent years to deal with fall and long, harsh winters. This forced them to develop time horizons, a concept of thrift and hoarding, and the ability to recognize saving for the future as a practical way to survive. </p>
<p>Constantly being warmed by the sun, however comforting it might have been, did very little to induce the African to do anything besides hunt, gather, and consume impulsively. The parsimony of nature, in Schopenhauer&rsquo;s words, was the African&rsquo;s undoing. This &#8220;sun brain/ ice-brain&#8221; dichotomy might be a little bit overly-simple, but it goes a long way toward explaining why a black athlete who makes $10 million a year will be broke before a white man who makes $50,000. </p>

		<p>It is always someone else&rsquo;s fault for black genetic deficiencies, how to handle money and to have savings are beyond most blacks&rsquo; ability.  Why do some whites continue this craziness year after year blaming everyone and everything else except the blacks themselves?  Does this holier than thou attitude make them feel good about themselves?</p>

<p>That is a truly stupid statement. The TRUTH is they simply aren&rsquo;t willing to delay gratification and plan ahead.</p>
<p>Our company had an excellent 401(k) plan which I put 15% into every paycheck and also got a 5% match. We also saved to pay cash for all the cars and other big ticket items we ever purchased and we paid our mortgage off early. We accumulated enough to retire at 55, that was 8 years ago and we&rsquo;re having a blast.</p>
<p>We never had a financial advisor. We simply used our brains and listened to the advice of others who had done the same.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Experts&#8221; say that the financial system has excluded African Americans for so long.  Were they prohibited from opening accounts?  Who are these experts?  I am dying to meet some of them.  Did they engage me?  Not to my knowledge.  Did they force Mike Tyson to blow away a few hundred million?  MC Hammer?  Etc,Etc, Etc.</p>

		<p>#1 &amp; others are correct of course, and this is (in)famous r/K strategy theory. Let me point out that blacks and others adapted to specific environments. Which strategy is better depends on environment. For example, in a hot climate with primitive technology, there is no way to preserve food, so the best strategy is to eat it or give it away. It makes no sense to save it. </p>
<p>But note that the African environment favored the development of certain physical and social capabilities which seem to be serving Africans well in contemporary America.</p>

<p><br>
Which experts? How has it excluded them? Blacks have had money for a long time. If blacks have been excluded, haven&rsquo;t other races also? Why don&rsquo;t Chinese-Americans have the same problem blacks have?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;In fact, 78 percent of respondents to the Prudential survey said they feel financial services companies &ldquo;have not effectively engaged the African-American community.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Most non-blacks have not been engaged either. They are simply able to better plan ahead. I guess this idea never crossed anyone&rsquo;s mind?</p>
<p><br>

<p>Neither do most Whites. We are getting tired of being blamed for blacks not doing X or Y.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the truth of the matter that blacks have only themselves to blame for not planning ahead financially? How does one of your ancestors being a slave 150 years ago prevent you from putting money in your 401k today?</p>

		<p>This is very true. Having worked with several blacks I always noticed that they rarely had money right before payday and often loaned each other money to buy lunch until the check was cashed. After a black co-worker complained about paying for tax preparation I offered to help and did his taxes for a case of beer. He made slightly more than I did from seniority but saved virtually nothing. The second year I did his taxes he showed me his bank statements and he had saved $700 for the year. He was shocked when I told him I had saved $12,000. We made about the same money, lived in similar circumstances, yet he managed to spend almost his entire income. I never figured it out.</p>

		<p>The last paragraph to this article, regarding why blacks don&rsquo;t save more, contains several nuggets of transparent nonsense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Experts say African-Americans distrust the financial system because it has excluded them for so long.&#8221; If one distrusts the financial system because you are skeptical of some of the practices exposed from the events leading to the most recession, then I would think that is understandable. But a person refuses to save and invest because they are pissed off that the nation&rsquo;s financial system did not adequately include blacks at some point in the past, thus indicating a choice to forego planning for that person&rsquo;s future, choosing to set himself back on a personal level, all in an act of spite? I don&rsquo;t buy it; if such people exist I am sure they are very, very few in number. </p>
<p>&#8220;78 percent of respondents to the Prudential survey said they feel financial services companies &#8216;have not effectively engaged the African-American community.&rsquo;&#8221; I have spent most of the last decade working in finance; here is how it works: If a person has money, financial services companies will engage you, if you do not, there is really not much to &#8220;engage&#8221; about. The only color that matters to financial services companies is green. A wealthy black person will have no difficulty finding a financial services company that will be quite happy to engage with him or her, a poor white person who shows up at the door of such a company will be told that they would be better off taking their business to their local bank and open a checking account with their meager savings.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them do not use or have access to financial advisers.&#8221; See my comments in the previous paragraph; if a person has money, he will plenty of access, if lacks money, he will not. Skin color has no bearing on the issue.</p>

<p>There they go again &hellip;blaming others for their shortcomings. Yes, it&rsquo;s all  someone else&rsquo;s fault. Blame whitey.  Anyone who knows them and has worked with them knows how short-sighted and improvident they are about money. They spend everything today and are broke by payday.  They buy everything on credit and many of them live in perpetual debt, paying off endless credit cards.</p>

<p>Do blacks do anything wrong that is not the fault of white people or are only white people capable of being evil on their own.</p>
<p>I notice that black people were perfectly fine trusting the financial system when they took out all those home loans that will never be paid back.</p>

<p>That is inaccurate.  I was hired by a large New York City bank in 1960.  There were blacks working there even then. Over the next thirteen years, I worked in two more  banks. They were full of blacks (especially towards the end).</p>
<p>The only difference back then was that blacks were hired and treated the same way as everybody else.  Same standards. Same pay. No discrimination. They did not receive special protections or benefits on account of race.  But by the early 70s that was already changing and blacks were being pushed upwards.</p>
<p>You can take it from someone who was there.</p>

		<p>Note how the &#8220;reason&#8221; provided is a bogus one that shifts responsibility AWAY from blacks. In truth most blacks are not very good at delaying gratification - a key to saving money. A &#8216;bling&rsquo; culture doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p>

		<p>Today I was standing at a bus stop with a black woman who was drinking from a can of beer. When she emptied the can, she threw it on the ground. Blacks seem to be more likely to litter than whites or Orientals. According to The 10,000 Year Explosion<br>
<a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2009/05/index.html</a><br>
that kind of behavior can be explained by the fact that blacks experienced a hunter gatherer existence more recently than whites and Orientals. Hunters were always on the move, so it made little sense to clean up after killing and eating an animal. When people settled down into farming communities they needed to clean up after butchering an animal, or they risked disease.</p>
<p>Farming also selected for the tendency to plan ahead, and defer gratification. One could not eat the seed corn. One could not butcher all of one&rsquo;s animals. </p>

		<p>These were average figures.  The reality is probably far more interesting.  As only 5% of blacks did not vote for Obama, I&rsquo;m guessing they have a large amount of assets which drove the blacks savings averages way up.</p>

		<p>The experts&rsquo; opinion is PC hogwash.  The reason blacks don&rsquo;t save money is because they want to SPEND their money before somebody close to them STEALS it from them.  Moreover, the majority of blacks do not have an education that allows them to have a job that pays decent money, so they use every dime to pay the basic bills.  Third, the rates of addiction and alcoholism in the black community are extremely high, and drugs/booze are not free   &mdash;   so paying the connection becomes more important than food, the kids&rsquo; shoes, etc. etc.  It all boils down to values - or the lack thereof.</p>

		<p>Since Prudential was mentioned in this article, I was wondering if there are also any difference in the auto accident rate for blacks when compared to whites. It would seem to follow their inherent traits that they would be responsible for causing more than their share of accidents. Maybe a deep, &#8220;dark&#8221; secret in insurance companies&rsquo; actuary tables.  Although, the insurance companies may not even be allowed to collect customer information by race but only factors in the neighborhoods when determining rates.  The suburbs have traditionally had lower auto rates than the cities.  Now with the new move of blacks to the suburbs, maybe the auto rates will start to climb there also. Whites who are replacing blacks in DC and Atlanta should expect to see lower auto rates.  </p>

		<p>In the last several decades the discount brokers, the no load mutual fund providers and the technology of the internet has truly lowered expense barriers to financial products &amp; investments.  They have democratized the industry making entry as little as a $100 per month and even lower via employer related savings plans such as 401K&rsquo;s.   There is no shortage of do it yourself (DIY) assistance via the internet and inexpensive financial publications.   This is all very color blind, this can all be done via the  internet and phone.   In addition to DIY several of the discount firms offer free or very low cost investment advice to clients with small to even very small accounts.   However most mainstream advice provides expectations with along the lines of historical returns and no guarantee of future returns, in which the advice provider has to  have the most difficult discussion of all.  You need to save more, sometimes substantial more if you hope you reach your goal.  Most don&rsquo;t like to hear this and in-turn will invest in highly speculative investments that are more likely to lose there investment then anything else. </p>
<p>Ariel Investments is a Black owned investment firm that has attempted to reach out to here own community.  Furthermore they have partnered with some of the very big players in the industry to reach out to African Americans.  I can attest that at least one of the firms they have partnered with have taken up the cause with evangelical like zeal.  But the old adage, you can lead a horse to water but you can&rsquo;t make them drink.  </p>
<p>I have to agree with Hirsch and my own experience.  I believe those of Euro descent have evolved a sense of delayed gratification that comes out in the form of savings.  I believe northern Asians may evolved this to even a great extent.  We witness it over and over again, amongst highly paid Black professional athletes the seemly inability to defer some of the compensation for when the playing days are over.</p>

<p>Interesting and seemingly quite plausible evolutionary explanation for black Africans&rsquo; apparently low propensity for conserving and delayed gratification.</p>
<p>Though this is a well established fact (though I&rsquo;ve known some exceptions among blacks), I suspect this tendency could be somewhat lessened by simply holding blacks to the same behavioral standards as all other races. </p>

They are called alcoholics &amp; addicts. I should know because I am one. I&rsquo;ve been clean for almost 9 years by the grace of God. But for years I would &#8220;cut off my nose to spite my face.&#8221; It is a form of mental illness, &amp; too many black enablers allow their fellow blacks to engage in dysfunctional, and criminal behavior and not take any blame for it.

		<p>Post 13- I am glad that we have someone who can tell it like it was about blacks in the 1960&rsquo;s. My Dad also told me about this. He said blacks didn&rsquo;t act like this years ago. This came up as we were watching the local news about a black teenager shooting and killing an elderly black man in a wheelchair. My Dad said that rap and gangster culture destroyed blacks.  I also think that the liberal&rsquo;s glorfying anything the blacks do has a tendency to make them feel invincible, and anyrhing they do will always be okay. Denial is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>However, this article does omit an important fact: With the price of gold going through the roof, many brothers and sisters already have a very nice portfolio on their person, what with all the necklaces, bracelets, earrings, teeth, Lil&rsquo; Jon-style chalices and walking canes, etc.- One of the main reasons they don&rsquo;t have it in the 401k, the desire for obscene levels of conspicuous consumption.</p>

		<p>SF Paul(that in my name, too).One reason why blacks dont save anything is the great scourge of the monetary system, INFLATION.  Blacks dont know how to deal with it.  And that is true for a lot of whites.  They just want to enjoy it while they have it. It must be invested in something that will not lose its value, the way dollars continually do.  Most of them do not know how to do that.It is very challenging, for any person of any race.</p>

<p>&#8220;One company that is trying to narrow the retirement savings gap among minority workers is McDonald&rsquo;s, which uses some unconventional (along with very traditional) methods to get black and Latino employees to save for retirement.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Might those &#8220;unconventional methods&#8221; include electroshock or other forms of aversion therapy? Because I fear that anything less than drastic measures won&rsquo;t work. </p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re up against is tens of thousands of years of African (non-) evolution, which has never spurred blacks as a group to progress beyond the kill-the-zebra-eat-it-now mentality of the savannah. That mentality plagues their communities to this day, regardless of what country they&rsquo;re in. </p>
<p>Also, to add a bit of &#8220;color commentary&#8221; to the ideas expressed by Hirsch #1 et al, I offer the following anecdote. A good friend once told me about a Czechoslovakian professor that he knew back in the 1970s or &rsquo;80s. The prof had managed to acquire his exit papers from then-commie Prague, and chose as his emigration destination&hellip; South Africa. He described tropical rural ZA as &#8220;like living in the Garden of Eden, a place where, if you chose, you could stay naked in the sunshine 12 months a year, and maintain a basic survival by doing nothing more than lazing around in the shade and occasionally plucking some fruit from the trees.&#8221; </p>
<p>When my friend related this, my rejoinder was as follows: &#8220;Yes indeed   &mdash;   and you just described how black Africans have been living since time immemorial. They&rsquo;ve never made anything more of themselves because they&rsquo;ve never NEEDED to make anything more of themselves. They never developed notions of delayed gratification or &#8220;time horizons&#8221; because they&rsquo;ve never NEEDED to. And when a people have never had any motivation to do something, there&rsquo;s no reason to expect they will. This live-for-the-moment strategy might have served them quite well back in the bush, but in our modern, advanced, white societies   &mdash;   INCLUDING South Africa   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster.&#8221; </p>

<p>Folks, you must start looking at this from a different perspective:  Blacks and other non-Whites are only doing what they&rsquo;re allowed to get away with while Whites are held down as targets of their wrath   &mdash;   a wrath stirred up by the media, academia and government, the prevailing triangulation that we&rsquo;re up against.</p>

&ldquo;For example, in a hot climate with primitive technology, there is no way to preserve food, so the best strategy is to eat it or give it away. It makes no sense to save it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preserving food is possible even in &ldquo;hot&rdquo; climatic conditions. Using ingenuity and or common sense can lead to solutions whether the climate is hot or cold or in-between.  African Blacks failed miserably across the board having not even advanced to developing the simple wheel or a written language for communication as evidence of their innate abilities. While Europe built cathedrals the Blacks in Africa struggled with grass huts.</p>
<p>Also, the contention that Blacks have &ldquo;physical and social capabilities which seem to be serving Africans well in contemporary America&rdquo; is true only because Blacks have for over half a century been the appeased beyond all repair minority of contemporary America.

		<p>&#8220;Post 13- I am glad that we have someone who can tell it like it was about blacks in the 1960&rsquo;s. My Dad also told me about this. He said blacks didn&rsquo;t act like this years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
- I wonder though, whether it is true that blacks behaved better in the past, or simply that people didn&rsquo;t hear about it. They did not have the internet, Amren, etc back then. In other words, the Christian social norms were still there for not discussing black behaviors negatively, and news came by mainsteam media, so without the internet and white-rights groups studying and disseminating information about what is going on racially, you never got the angles back then on it that you can get now (which led to a slew of foolish assumptions guiding the government actions and decisions of the 60s, which we are still having to suffer with to this day). These behavioral tendencies, violence, impulsiveness, etc have strong genetic underpinnings, so would have been there largely unchanged for many generations.</p>
<p>That being said, it is possible that blacks repressed these tendencies more in the past than now. Liberals and black rights activists encouraging them to rise up against whitey, plus the knowledge that judicial activists and racist juries will let them go, is like throwing gasoline on a smoldering fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;A September 1999 study by Freddie Mac, for instance, confirmed what previous Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation studies had found: that African-Americans have disproportionate levels of credit problems, which explains why they have a harder time qualifying for mortgage money. As Freddie Mac found, blacks with incomes of $65,000 to $75,000 a year have on average worse credit records than whites making under $25,000.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The [Freddie Mac] researchers, relying on data from credit reports, designated people as having &#8220;bad credit&#8221; if they had two bills overdue more than 30 days in the past two years, one bill more than 90 days late, a lien, a judgment or a bankruptcy. Their data showed that a higher percentage of African Americans with incomes of $65,000 to $75,000 had &#8220;bad credit&#8221; than whites with incomes below $25,000.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading the back and forth about whether blacks &#8220;back then&#8221; were really better behaved on average, or whether we just think they do because AR and YouTube weren&rsquo;t available in the 1950s.</p>
<p>First off, I always get suspicious when old timers wax poetic about &#8220;back then.&#8221;  People suffer from selective memories.  For instance, I wish I had a dime for every old timer I&rsquo;ve heard go on and on about how great their stint in the military was.  But for almost all of them, when they were in the military, they couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out.</p>
<p>As far as blacks &#8220;back then,&#8221; I think the ultimate answer to the debate between &#8220;were generally more behaved&#8221; and &#8220;we just didn&rsquo;t hear about atrocities&#8221; is yes.  A mixture of both.  However, the caveat is that to the extent they were generally better behaved back then, it was (A) Only when surrounded by whites, (B) Mostly towards whites, while they were more their natural selves toward each other, and (C) Because they had fear of a white cops whacking a baton across their skulls if they stepped out of line.  The civil rights era legally eliminated (C) as an option, and each year that passed, blacks feared the white police baton less and less, and therefore reverted to their natural selves.  The welfare state, more or less the quasi-implementation of the &#8220;low hanging fruit&#8221; African climate to American economics, ramped up at about the same time the civil rights laws were passed, so their gradually declining fear of whites and white police came at the same time when the reliable monthly low hanging fruits started coming.</p>

		<p>the virtues of prudence and frugality are markedly <br>
lacking in huge numbers of white people as well. It is something that is learned.  My son worked counceling people about to lose their homes. He told me he lost compassion and respect for most of them. People making three times what he did had nothing and were in debt up to their nostrils. Teach the children, and that is not a theoretical course, you learn it from mom and dad, making ends meet, making do, setting goals, reaching them. Where are mom and dad?  White kids are nothing but stupid consumers from my experience. spoiled by their parents feeling guilty for leaving them to strangers, so mom can have her &#8220;career.&#8221;  If she did the arithmatic, she could figure out raising her children, practicing frugality and having a career after the children are big, would have served them all better. <br>

QD, I did not  <i>&#8220;wax poetic&#8221;  </i>about how wonderful times were back then.  I only told the story very neutrally and objectively  as I saw it with my own eyes. You can be as sceptical as you like, Mr. Know-it-all, but I was a witness to history, and you were not! Your collection of statistics (which you have read) cannot replace an actual first-hand memory.</p>
<p>Nor did I in any way imply that ALL blacks had it great, nor that ALL blacks were well behaved. Many were not.  However, those who  got hired were the well behaved ones. Only towards the end of the 60&rsquo;s was there a massive governmental push to force the hiring the ghetto types. Middle class blacks had <br>
always been hired.<br>
 <br>
Going back even before that, there were black policemen, black principals, and black everything   &mdash;   at least in the North and  in the West  (perhaps not in your Missouri).  In fact, even before I was hired by the bank in 1960, I worked for a time at American  Express (credit cards).  There, the private secretary to the Big Shot was a black woman.   She wielded a lot of clout!   Yes, if you were competent you could get hired and promoted, color regardless.  Contrary to the popular mythology today, they were not discriminated against. If anything, they were helped and treated sympathetically. You can choose to believe otherwise if you like.</p>
<p>This is not a figment of my  imagination nor the product of a &#8220;selective memory&#8221;.  My mind and memory are  quite sound.  Are you implying otherwise? Or do you really prefer to sympathize with the  black shake-down agenda which blames white racism for everything?  Whose side are you on, I sometimes have to wonder?</p>

		<p>A lot of you are making unfounded accusations toward black people. Unless you can experience growing up in a very poor community you wouldn&rsquo;t understand. As a matter of fact, this title is unfounded. &#8220;Why Don&rsquo;t Blacks Save More&#8221;? Uhhh&hellip; how about, &#8220;Why Doesn&rsquo;t The Poor Save More&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a proven fact that majority of blacks are extremely poor or living borderline poverty level within America. I can tell you why Blacks don&rsquo;t save money because I&rsquo;m black and grew up in the projects for a very long time. Blacks CAN&rsquo;T save because of their low income. Do you think gas prices, food prices, clothing prices, and utility bills discriminate? Oh, they&rsquo;re black lets lower the prices shall we&hellip; Uhhh NO. Majority of the people in my neighborhood struggled to keep from being evicted. But let me ask you this&hellip; why do you think MAJORITY of blacks are poor. Our poverty didn&rsquo;t just spring out of thin air&hellip; You don&rsquo;t need a retirement plan if you don&rsquo;t have any money to spare and you struggle just to pay bills </p>

		<p>I think you folks are simplifying Africa a bit.<br>
It&rsquo;s true that they don&rsquo;t have a lot of snow like this-</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/jFb7S</p>
<p>But they do have highly variated seasons and in particular a short, torrential, wet season, followed by 8-9 months of progressively worse drout.</p>
<p>They suffer from huge amounts of natural pestilence (limited water, large animal populations = multiple pathogen vectors with a common human-associated species jump point) and while predation is not what it was, among hunters both two and four footed, there is still considerable deprivation there as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/LH7u" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/LH7u</a></p>
<p>One of the things we fail too often to note is that a large elderly population can readily serve as a means to institutionalize veneration of cycles as systems.  The old Christian &#8216;God has a purpose&hellip;&rsquo; excuse being more a way to explain the outcomes from a given disaster or other event than a justification for them happening in the first place (like saying a flood brought life to a field after it killed the man who would have planted it).</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t happen, and there are significant signs that it did not because the environment was so very awful for so very long, you lose the -process- by which a population can begin to build up the &#8216;collective wisdom&rsquo; which orients and restricts their activities towards more positive and less predatory/exploitative/reactionary objectives.</p>
<p>Adults died in Africa so rapidly that only by taking a neighboring tribes women could one threatened by extinction go on.  Only by rapid development and generational handoff between genes could populations survive diseases in particular by virtue of Muller&rsquo;s Ratchet and similar (interpositional meiotic switches) mechanisms could populations stay ahead of the genetics game which bacteria run through at several hundred times the generational rates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ONLY because they are lazy.  ONLY because they have had it so easy for so long.</p>
<p>In fact, it is probably the opposite.</p>
<p>What we have to realize is that if we import this population to our world, we need to create systems (like the military with it&rsquo;s regimented expecations in turn for four squares and a place to hang your hat) that compensate for the genetic effects.</p>
<p>If we do not want to instead destroy our own welfare safety net.</p>
<p>We are headed that way now, with the kinds of multiple municipality failures and terrible bankruptcy issues now facing us, we will either be buying into long term bonds to bail out the U.S. at something like a 70% tax rate.  Or we will be living in a nation owned by our debt holders.</p>
<p>i.e.  Whites have only to look at our political elites to see where to hang our own heads in shame for a policy of spending money that doesn&rsquo;t belong to us but to our children and our elders.</p>

		<p>I have worked among blacks in a number of situations, and a major problem   &mdash;   to which blacks themselves admit   &mdash;   is their own inability to think long term.  This is also something that has been observed among blacks in Africa, where black farmers can bring in a good crop for one year, but long term planning seems to be beyond them.  The short term thinking just may be genetic, or it may be cultural, but regardless, it causes much of the behavior mentioned. As this is not in line with liberal ideology, immediately the &#8220;blame YT&#8221; chanting starts up.  Of course, this just accelerates the cycle towards irresponsibility.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Experts say African-Americans distrust the financial system because it has excluded them for so long.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>If this is the case, then why do we not see liberal experts start their own banks and market them to blacks? </p>
<p>The kind of argument quoted never pauses to ask where were all the liberals during the days of segregation. Why didn&rsquo;t they set up banks, businesses, schools, and other institutions to reach the black market. Would that have required them to put their money where their mouths were, quite literally?</p>
<p>For that matter, segregation has been over for quite some time, I am given to understand. Why have blacks themselves not filled in the market niche by setting up their own banks and financial institutions? </p>
<p>You also have to wonder at the role of the government in all this, perhaps with an agenda via the welfare state, to keep blacks, for the most part, in the bottom rung of the economy and thus as a permanent client class. </p>
