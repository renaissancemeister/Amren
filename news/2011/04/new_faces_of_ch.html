<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America&rsquo;s child population grew more far diverse over the past decade as a decline in the ranks of white children was offset by surging growth of Asians and Hispanics.</p>
<p>All told in 2010, the Census Bureau counted 74.2 million people under age 18, up 1.9 million from 2000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of non-Hispanic whites fell in 46 states and 86 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas. In 10 states, white children are now a minority among their peers, including six that tipped between 2000 and 2010. Others will follow soon: In 23 states, minorities make up more than 40% of the child population.</p>
<p>The number of black and Native American children declined as well, but by a far smaller degree than whites, according to an analysis of 2010 Census data to be released Wednesday by the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank in Washington. The Census Bureau released the first results of its once-a-decade head count of U.S. residents, regardless of citizenship, late last year; over subsequent months, Census released state and local data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The data show the extent to which the U.S. has become dependent on minorities  &mdash;  Hispanics in particular  &mdash;  for the next generation of Americans. From 2000 to 2010, almost half of states saw a decline in the number of children.</p>
<p>Without Hispanics, America&rsquo;s under-18 population would have declined between 2000 and 2010. And in places that did see an increase, Hispanics accounted for most of the growth. In Texas, the state with the largest population gain over the decade, Hispanics accounted for 95% of the growth among the population under age 18.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The number of non-Hispanic white children fell by 4.3 million over the decade. {snip} Meantime, the number of Hispanic and Asian children grew by 5.5 million, with 4.8 million of those Hispanic.</p>
<p>Part of the decline in white children is a result of an increase in mixed-race children, who remain a tiny share of the overall population but grew 46%  &mdash;  or roughly 900,000  &mdash;  between 2000 and 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The changing makeup of the U.S. could play a significant role in setting national priorities, especially as Washington grapples with debt obligations that are sparking fights over which entitlement programs to cut and by how much.</p>

		<p>Read the original WSJ article, especially the last two paragraphs.  They are telling because the WSJ admits a Hispanic/Asian body politic would take money away from Social Security and Medicare to give more welfare money to younger Hispanics and Asians.  Remember, the party line from that very same newspaper for years is that we &#8220;need&#8221; all those Hispanics and Asians as legal immigrants and eventually as citizens in order to have enough younger workers to save Social Security and Medicare.</p>

		<p>The Wall Street Journal is of course owned by the well known race-replacement enthusiast and  billionaire Rupert Murdoch&hellip;who also  owns the fake &#8220;conservative&#8221; news station Fox News. So if you are a viewer of Fox News-whether or not you want to accept this-you are subsidizing the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Only one thing has to be said in response to the WSJ:  bold-face lie.</p>
<p>What is behind the race-replacement enthusiasm of the WSJ? Answer:the unbounded greed of the White Greedy Cheating Class. The editor of the WSJ has a well documented record of promoting the economic agenda of the Corporate White Greedy Cheating Class. This guy has a pathological hatred of ordinary working class Native Born White Americans from the American Heartland&hellip;a truly evil creature.</p>
<p>The vaulting greed of the White Greedy Cheating Class is the rock-bottom force behind the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority.</p>
<p>The policy of race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority-for reasons of enormous greed-of course, will eventually throw America into a state of high national stress. If the editor of the WSJ thinks for one minute that he and his family are going to escape the consequences of destroying American society-and lets be honest, this is what will happen with probability one-all I can say is this:he is mighty delusional.</p>

		<p>I went to a maternity suite at a local hospital recently for my 20 week ultrasound.  The waiting room looked like Tijuana!  Most of the vacant-eyed &#8220;Latinas&#8221; were without wedding rings, of course, and several feral children were climbing on the office furniture like a jungle gym.  Needless to say, I&rsquo;m sure I was one of the only paying customers there.</p>
<p>This country is heading down the tubes faster than I thought possible.  The chaotic slum scene in that waiting room made me afraid for my children.  <br>

		<p>There are approximately 50 million white couples of child bearing age in the US.  If each pair had one extra kid, 50 million more whites would cause an explosion in the white population in about a year&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I wonder why this stat is never pointed out?  Could it be the leftist MSM are afraid they&rsquo;ll put ideas into the heads of too many whites?</p>

An indicator of the challenge this growing demographic will increasingly present to our government schooling monopolies is the white-Hispanic &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; at age 2-3 and at age 17:</p>
<p>See &ldquo;Studies Find Latino Toddlers Lag White Children in Cognitive Skills&rdquo;<br>
Carla Rivera, Los Angeles Times, October 20, 2009<br>
https://tinyurl.com/6h8pygp</p>
<p>KEY EXCERPT: Latino toddlers (2 or 3 years olds) &ldquo;trail their white counterparts by up to six months in understanding words, speaking in more complex sentences and performing such simple tasks as assembling puzzles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>==</p>
<p>How the six months &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; at age 2 or 3 looks by twelfth grade: From Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Closing the Achievement Gap, National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>

		<p>For the moment, it appears that all is in place for the Establishment, and all its cultural institutions, to be able to successfully brainwash the new generations of European-Americans as my generation was brainwashed in the 1960&rsquo;s during the Hippie and Civil Rights Movements. Only a few of us from the Baby Boomer generation eventually were able to see what had taken place.</p>
<p>However, aside from feeling still like a majority group back in those times, which we were, the national economy back then was much more dynamic than it is today. Jobs were plentiful and the living was relatively easy, as almost all of the college and university educated individuals were able to later become fairly well off and &#8220;success stories&#8221; in the abundant consumer society.</p>
<p>But these new, dark economic clouds, which have been settling on the United States and the entire Western World, are a &#8220;gathering storm&#8221; of major proportions. I don&rsquo;t believe the U.S. will be able to handle it, and if the economy finally spins off into hyper-inflation, Argentine-style, as I believe it will, then a &#8220;No future for you&#8221; angst will settle over the entire country and ethnic consciousness will be finally raised among young people of European descent as a shrinking economic pie will be fought over. At that point a counter-cultural revolution of the Racial Right should finally take hold.</p>

<p>Yes, Jupiter7 is right as always. Fox News and Murdock are anti-White as they come..ever hear O&rsquo;Reilly and Beck?  Nary a word of praise for any White person.

<p>While I certainly don&rsquo;t agree with Murdoch&rsquo;s immigration views, he really doesn&rsquo;t have the power to force Congress to not act in stopping illegal immigration. The WSJ article is reporting factual information, not commenting that our country will be better because of more illegals. </p>
<p>The problems are due to poor leadership in Congress and the Executive Branch.  Yet Arizonans continue to elect John McCain, and South Carolinians Lindsey Graham.  </p>
<p>As a Fox News/WSJ consumer, I am able to place blame squarely where it is due&hellip;spineless GOP politicians that allow themselves to be swayed by shouts of racism from liberals.</p>

<p>So true!  I have seen it time and again!  Ever go to the grocery store and see all those WIC cards and EBT cards (Food stamp cards)jumping out of their purses at the register?  How about them bringing the WHOLE family with them and their kids all over the place?  </p>
<p>I have sat in my car waiting for my son to get his groceries (he is disabled, but does NOT &#8220;qualify&#8221; for food stamps!!) I sit and watch all the blacks and browns in their cars, walking from their NEW cars/Vans, blocking access to parking spaces, their kids running, without looking, in front of the cars and I think I am living in HELL, not America.</p>
<p> This is NOT my America, the way America was SUPPOSE to be. I feel so isolated and alone in the &#8220;new&#8221; America and it will only get worse.</p>

<p>That would be a great thing but wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem for the simple fact that whites are competing for America not just with those Hispanics already within our borders but with ALL of Latin America.  No matter how many men are bailing out the Titanic unless we stem at least most of the leaks we are stilling going under.</p>

Thanks to the woman&rsquo;s movement and white men doing nothing&hellip;</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years in the USA, a man&rsquo;s real adjusted-for-inflation median income has not increased.  But over the same period, a woman&rsquo;s real income increased, so more woman are working today.  A man&rsquo;s income cannot support a family that once did during the baby boom years.  Today families can&rsquo;t afford to have the woman stay home to raise kids.<br>

		<p>So, basically what you are seeing is not &#8216;immigration&rsquo; as such, but race replacement, nothing more nothing less.One race (Whites) is fading away only to have their place taken up by another race.Some might argue that competition for scarce resources, working in a Darwinian manner actually drives the &#8216;less vigorous&rsquo; race to die out - thus government policy could be blamed for the the phenomenom.<br>
  Many years ago, when immigration was but a trickle and &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; few and far between, the more perceptive warned of the this dire consequence of massive uncontrolled immigration.<br>
 But the WSJ and the politicians knew better, of course.</p>

<p>Does anyone here think young HIspanics who have been raised on a diet of hate whitey and &#8220;social justice&#8221; issues aimed at destroying whites will be willing to support old white people with SSI and medicare?</p>
<p>Once Hispanics are in power, and they WILL have political power, they won&rsquo;t reduce social security and medicare, they will end it.</p>
<p>After that will come land and wealth confiscations needed to support a burgeoning Hispanic welfare population, and this is, after all, according to hispanics, their land, you are the colonist, not them, and they want you OFF.</p>

		<p>More hispanic children is one of many census related anouncements lately. The fastest growing minority, soon to be number one among birth rates, blah, blah, blah. I wonder how many hispanics have asked themselves, With our numbers increasing and minorities becoming the majority, are there going to be enough lawns for all of us to mow? Enough tables to bus? Mestizos come here because the jobs are here, right? To get a better life right? They leave Mexico, where most people are hispanic, right? When here becomes there, where will they go then?</p>

		<p>Among other things, Hispanics are the number one driving force of the exploding &#8220;US&#8221; population-which is just another way of saying that Hispanics are a major force of ecological destruction-from here on in-in &#8220;America&#8221;. Hispanics and other high fertility post-1965 nonwhites are an ecologically destabilizing force within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;. Over time-with 100 percent certainty-they will cause ecological collapse within the borders of America&hellip;.all growth does eventually come to an end.</p>
<p>The idiot White Men-millions- their wives and children, who consume sports entertainment&hellip;and meta-level forms of escapism such as fantasy football(what comes next fanatasy fantasy football)-will not esacpe the final reckoning&hellip;..which is surely comming&hellip;right around the corner.</p>
<p>Everyone here should have no illusions about the following:Amensty-one way or another-will pass in the near future:it is a done deal. So the obvious question arises:why continue posting here. Well, there is a very good reason for posting on American Renaissance and financially supporting American Renaissance and it is this:the full-blown and  very nasty consequences of the passage of amnesty will be felt by millions of Native Born White Americans the day after it becomes a real-time reality. It&rsquo;s disorienting effects will be felt immediately.  American Renaissaince,vdare.com and Alternative Right-and several other pro-White websites-will be the only game in town for millions of Native Born White Americans. We have developed a framework over the years that millions of Native Born White Americans can tap into immediately..do not underestimate the importance of this&hellip;it is the first step towards reversing the situation.</p>

		<p>Is Conor Dougherty, the man who wrote this article, even aware of the fact that third and forth generation Hispanics living in the US continue to underperform academically compared with white (and Asian) youngsters, regardless of their generation? In light of this sobering reality, why would anyone think that an increase in the Hispanic population bodes well for the future?! Indeed, if the &#8216;acheivement gap&rsquo; between whites and Orientals on one hand and blacks and mestizos on the other has a significant genetic component (which it probably does), US immigration and welfare policy is undoubably making this counrty a more miserable place to live. Is that &#8220;progress&#8221;, Mr. Dougherty?</p>

		<p>Have you ever been to any hospital anywhere in California? Not one paying customer for miles! It seems that every wise Latina that hops across the &#8220;border&#8221; immediately acquires a couple of &#8216;anchors&rsquo; at the public dime in addition to a life time of free or subsidized medical care. Also, our friends from South of the &#8220;border&#8221; immediately avail themselves of other welfare programs and never get off them (https://cis.org/immigrant-welfare-use-2011).</p>
<p>This mess is a silent conspiracy between the Upper and Middle White Classes. The upper classes are aristocratic and the middle want to be so they hire maids and nannies and pretend to care about the poor people &#8220;who only come here to work.&#8221; In the process, they successfully betrayed and destroyed the White Working Class. Now, we are about to witness the Great Betrayal of the idiot Middle Class as their jobs are disappearing too and their communities are turning into semi-ghettos because the &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; and their ilk keep moving into their beautiful suburbia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all so sad.</p>

		<p>@ whiteraven: <i>There are approximately 50 million white couples of child bearing age in the US. If each pair had one extra kid, 50 million more whites would cause an explosion in the white population in about a year&rsquo;s time.</i></p>
<p>For what?  50 million more whites to grow up and pay taxes to support even more Third Worlders?  No, more whites will not be the ticket, in and of themselves.  Only an adjustment in white thinking will ever work.  Perhaps it is best if the system completely degenerates.  Then, those that are left may pick up the pieces if they can learn a lesson.</p>

<p>They won&rsquo;t need your vote once they have sufficient numbers, as they do in many parts of California.  Their activists will have &#8220;get out the vote drives&#8221; for school bond issues, rousting out apartment dwellers in high numbers, illegal or not (ask Bob Dornan) as YOUR legislature votes to lower the threshold for bond passage, from two-thirds to a simple majority, as happened in California.</p>
<p>ALL school bonds now pass in Los Angeles, making the average homeowner beholden for 30+ years, approximately an extra $650+/year in property taxes for schools that your White children cannot attend.</p>
<p>This is the new reality.</p>
<p>Northern Virginia Mom:</p>
<p><i>The waiting room looked like Tijuana!</i> </p>
<p>Yeah, welcome to our world in California   &mdash;   20 years ago!  If Northern Virginia follows the same pattern as California, and all indications certainly look that way, you can expect there to be NO hospital waiting room in the near future.  </p>
<p>You see, that non-paying Mexican population will soon overburden your hospitals to the point where they can&rsquo;t keep their doors open, just as has happened in California.</p>

<p>And finally from Anon:</p>
<p><i>A man&rsquo;s income cannot support a family that once did during the baby boom years.</i></p>
<p>So true!  </p>
<p>The progressive tax system has forced females like me into the workforce   &mdash;    a tax system that supports low IQd illegal immigrants to reproduce at will by providing free maternity care, WIC, free housing, etc., leaving Whites like me compelled to pay for ourselves AND the freeloaders, forcing us to limit the size of our families.</p>
<p>I would have loved to have had more blond and red-haired, blue and green-eyed children.  Would have loved it!!  But, government policies, specifically tax policies forced me to stop after two.  </p>

<p>I understand your frustration; I even share it.  But what I don&rsquo;t share is your defeatist attitude, all due respect to you.  </p>
<p>Whiteraven has it right.  50 million more whites is a lot of people with (potentially, at least) western values and outlook.</p>
<p>You are right about the taxation and confiscation of whites, which is lamentable.  But the alternative is to do nothing or have whites migrate to the US from other parts of the world, which we know, is not likely.  </p>

<p>Every Fox News fake conservative celebrity is on board with the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority at the hands high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.  And this includes Judge Andrew Napolitano who comes much closer to being a true conservative.  Fox News also gives a huge platform to Geraldo Rivera who openly cheers - on Fox News - for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority. If you are a regular viewer of Fox News, you are a revenue stream for Rupert Murdoch and the platform he gives to race-replacement enthusiasts and fake conservatives such as Glenn Beck and Bill O&rsquo;Reilly.</p>
<p>And then there is the  Fox News constant cheerleading for wars of aggression on behalf of both the treasonous Republican and Democratic Parties. And as I have argued here and other places:the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority goes hand-in-hand with invading the world. I reject the the Republican-Democratic dual policy of invading the world and inviting the world.</p>
<p>Why on earth would you want to be a revenue stream for such a treasonous-and despicable-institution such as Fox News?</p>

The problem with picking up the pieces is that nobody has every dealt with a Malthusian outcome that numbered in the tens of millions -per group- of competitor populations.  There will be no ADS, no &#8216;rubber bullets&rsquo;, no gas nor livefire that can suppress a population of starving from locusting the landscape, completely.</p>
<p>Whites only manage to live together in the numbers we do because we are socially cohesive.</p>
<p>But we will not survive the inundation of such numbers as are being scattered like the seeds of the whirlwind amongst us.  </p>
<p>THAT is the definitive signature condition here and the essence of the lie in this statement-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The data show the extent to which the U.S. has become dependent on minorities &mdash; Hispanics in particular &mdash; for the next generation of Americans.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Because it implies that more is good.  That more is better.  That more is survival.</p>
<p>It is not.  It is death.  For them and for us.  It will be as though WWII was a minor skirmish with losses numbering in the high hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Capitalism is to blame.  Because capitalism works by charging &#8216;stocks and bondage&rsquo;, a penny per process that a given back bends itself to.  Why we would want our children to service such a fools quest for enslavement I do not know.  But the assumption that more ethnics will serve where we do not produce enough replacements to sustain &#8216;profit margins&rsquo; is a fools game.  Mestizos, Blacks and Asians are only here for the material wealth.  When it seems that they are not getting that in adequate amounts, they will act to secure it from those who -have it-.  As the wealthy white residual upper class.</p>
<p>And the outnumbered middle and working class whites will not be there to support them.</p>

		<p>Ever notice that these rosy coloured articles are kept as far away from the articles about overpopulation and environment as possible?</p>
<p>On the one hand, they warn us of environmental degradation and the dangers of overpopulation -obviously with the intent of making responsible people limit the number of children they conceive. </p>
<p>On the other hand, they tell us how badly we &#8220;need&#8221; these undereducated swarms to come in and &#8220;save&#8221; us.</p>

<p>I of course don&rsquo;t agree with everything Fox personalities say, Jerry Rivers included, but Murdoch doesn&rsquo;t have the power to inject millions of illegals and slow white reproduction rates.  Therefore, adding revenue to his (publicly-traded) company neither hurts nor helps our greater cause.</p>
<p>The race replacement is occurring because the Federal government won&rsquo;t secure the border, plain and simple.  It is the Executive Branch  &mdash;  including Clinton, Bush, and Obama, who should be tried for treason.  White reproduction declines can be thanked to liberal social activists who persuaded baby boomers to treat sex as an avenue for &#8220;self-expression&#8221; not reproduction.</p>
<p>We need to place the blame where it is due.</p>

I don&rsquo;t believe the U.S. will be able to handle it; and if the economy finally spins  into hyper-inflation, then a &ldquo;No future for you&rdquo; angst will settle over the entire country and ethnic consciousness will be finally raised among young people of European descent, as a shrinking economic pie will be fought over. At that point a counter-cultural revolution of the Racial Right should finally take hold.</i><br>

<p>Dear Mr. Jones, I agree with everything you said in your interesting post   &mdash;   except for having  some grave reservations about your last statement regarding  rising ethnic consciousness and racial revolution among the young. </p>
<p>That will not be so easy. And hardly automatic. The Powers That Be who rule us will fight that development tooth and nail. It is the keystone in their whole platform. Everything is based on that, and they will not abandon it without a fight.</p>
<p>All the relentless propaganda that has been poured into young people&rsquo;s heads, year after year - in the classroom, on TV, and everywhere - has been geared to head off the development of exactly any such racial consciousness.<b> A whole lifetime of 24-hour conditioning will not be wiped away overnight</b>&hellip; maybe with a rare few, but not not with millions who have been brainwashed with white guilt, racial egalitarianism, belief that blacks are &#8220;cool&#8221;, whites are dull, foreigners are interesting, and the notion that race is merely  a social construct that is nothing more than skin deep.</p>
<p>Even in times of economic crisis and turmoil, so long as the media powers (and academics)  still manage to retain any authority at all, they will fight this development to the very last breath. That will be their last ditch stand. The highly paid hacks and pretty faces of Hollywood and the TV screen  (highly paid even in a depression!) will howl in unison about the new, evil wave of &#8220;racism&#8221; rising in the country; and most gullible youg whites, conditioned as they&rsquo;ve been all their  lives to heed the  superior wisdom of celebrities, will believe them. From rock stars to sports figures to weathermen, they will all exhort  us to fight this terrible new &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Control of the media is absolutely essential! </b> The Left knows this very well; and that precious control, their ace card,  is  <i>the very last thing </i> that they will give up, even when the country is crumbling around them.  </p>
<p>No, I do not fo foresee any easy transition (or epiphany) among the young.  It will not be that easy.  </p>
<p>Far more likely, they will be told that all their problems are the result of past white racism,  the inheritance from their benighted elders, and they will be urged to grovel even more and  pay more restitution to the sacred minorities who burden us by the many millions. Many gullible whites will do so.  So long as the mass media retain  <i>any shred of power,</i> they will NEVER, never allow a return to racial consciousness.  And the government, if it still exists, will  collaborate slavishly with them.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, those prophets who promote racial consciousness will be portrayed as the worst monsters in human history since Attila the Hun, Adolf Hitler, and Genghis Kahn. Even worse, in fact.  Expect to be demonized!</p>

		<p>Everyone posting their observations here are so right.  I work in an urban school where every student is Latino.  Most upper management is also.  The surrounding neighborhood for miles in every direction is like Mexico, and I&rsquo;m in the northeast part of the nation!</p>
<p>I seriously wonder why we even bother trying to teach them English anymore, I really do.  Among themselves it&rsquo;s 95% Spanish. (A very few do try to learn English.)  Outside in the street same thing.  In their homes etc - it&rsquo;s a Spanish world.</p>
<p>The other day I did something I haven&rsquo;t done in a long time.  I have all my favorite radio stations preprogrammed.  One of them recently changed to a Spanish language station (on FM).  So I did the scan feature to look for another station to program in that slot.  Last time I did that was about three years ago.</p>
<p>Lo and behold if I didn&rsquo;t find about 40% of the radio stations, (on FM) were Spanish language stations!  The other 30% were black and hip hip/rap stations.  That left only 30% of the stations as &#8220;American&#8221; stations ranging from pop, punk to rock or talk radio (with one classical station).</p>
<p>I never would have imagined that in this major metro area in the northeast that 40% of the stations would be Spanish.  All the government forms are in Spanish.  Even at Target half the products have multi-lingual labels on them.  On the sides of city buses, every third or fourth of the ads I see are directly in Spanish.  No English at all!  My world is changing noticeably before my eyes - not in generations, but in spurts of 3-4 years!</p>
<p>I see Latinos 90% of the time, no matter I go in this city, and the females almost always have 2-4 babies/kids in tow.</p>
<p>So why the farce of &#8216;we have to teach them English?&rsquo;  What? Is it for &#8216;college?&rsquo;  As poster 7 quoted: &#8220;&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people.&#8221;  Sure, their activists will get them into college, but no matter how dumbed down the curriculum, most will drop out the first semester.</p>
<p>In my experience with high schoolers, they are more behind than that, and the average maturity level is also just as low.  The future looks grim to me, from where I&rsquo;m at.  </p>

		<p>Herein lies the problem; the entitlement programs are hugely expensive and are totally reliant on a Ponzi-like scheme of increasing number of younger earners supporting those users of entitlements.  However as the bolus of baby-boomers approach retirement with increasing draw on Social Security and medical benefits, that underlying and supporting population is not up to the task.  The influx of low-educated manual laborers are insufficient earners to support the Ponzi-pyramid.  Further a huge number of them are illegal and don&rsquo;t contribute to the tax base, and in fact are tax-takers or users of costly public benefits.  And different than in the past, these groups appear to resist assimilation into the the economic ladder.</p>

<p>*****************</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s exactly a colossal Ponzi-type scheme that is being promoted on a massive national scale; but  those Bernie Madoff types behind it will be long out of the country with their loot stashed elsewhere when their house of cards comes tumbling down.   Tumbling down on US, that is, not on THEM.</p>
<p>What they fail to consider (or don&rsquo;t whant us to think about) is that those new immigrants, legal or illegal, <b>will someday get old too and will require care themselves. </b> Who will provide in turn for THEM?  Still more immigrants?  An endless stream of immigrants forever pouring in?  More and more immigrants to care for past immigrants!  This crazy scheme obviously cannot go on forever.</p>
<p>And another thing, as others here have commented, it is only the first generation of immigrants who are willing to work hard. Their US-born children will take their benefits and citizenship for granted and will not want to work so hard as their parents did. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll be saddled  with  a whole new layer of dependants with an entitlement mentality &hellip; &#8220;gimme, gimme&#8221; will be their theme song. Eventually, America will be crushed under the  the burden of people demanding benefits but nobody wanting to contribute.  How long can the productive white middle class support this?</p>

		<p>The anti-white animus of Rupert Murdoch can be seen even in his own family. Rupert has taken up with a Chinese woman and has a child with her who will grow up and own a part of his empire. Furthermore, his daughter Elizabeth was married to Ghanaian mulatto Elkin Pianim (Ronald Reagan was a guest at the wedding), and consequently Murdoch has 2 mulatto grand children. Elizabeth, who subsequently married a member of the Freud family, is influential in Murdoch&rsquo;s firm.</p>
