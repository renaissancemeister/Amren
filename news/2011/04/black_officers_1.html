<h1><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_112/-205011-1.html">Black Officers Lodge New Discrimination Complaint</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Newhauser, Roll Call, April 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten years ago last week, more than 100 black Capitol Police officers marched into the John Adams Building, held hands, prayed together and filed what would become one of the largest discrimination complaints in the history of Congress.</p>
<p>The grievance, filed first with the Office of Compliance then taken to court that fall, was that more than 200 black officers were denied promotions, retaliated against and unfairly disciplined or fired, all on the basis of their race.</p>
<p>The Capitol, they charged in the complaint, was a &#8220;modern-day version of a 19th-century Southern plantation in law enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>A decade later, Blackmon-Malloy v. U.S. Capitol Police Board has yet to be resolved and the latest proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia center not on the merits of the claims, but which plaintiffs even have the right to bring them. Defense lawyers have spent the better part of the decade whittling down the number of plaintiffs. Meanwhile, 17 have died.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew it would be a lengthy time period,&#8221; said retired Capitol Police Lt. Sharon Blackmon-Malloy, the lead plaintiff in the case, who has attended all but one court hearing over the past decade. &#8220;But we didn&rsquo;t expect that it would be ongoing 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of celebrating the case as a catalyst for change, on Tuesday, Blackmon-Malloy and several black officers will unveil new racial discrimination charges and lodge a complaint with the D.C. Bar against a Capitol Police attorney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wholesale institutional discrimination against black officers prevented them from advancing in their careers, they say.</p>
<p>On April 12, 2001, Blackmon-Malloy and more than 100 other officers made their protest march to the Office of Compliance to file their complaint under the Congressional Accountability Act, the measure that provides Congressional employees protection under 11 federal labor laws covering civil rights, fair employment and discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the OOC mediation was fruitless and the case was filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C. in October 2001. By that time, the case had grown to include more than 300 plaintiffs.</p>
<p>They were asking for $100 million in compensation, the creation of a temporary oversight board to monitor issues of discrimination and retaliation protection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Capitol Police Chief Philip Morse said in a statement that he will soon hire a diversity officer to replace one who left the department last year. He said that he is &#8220;committed to the continued improvement of the Department&rsquo;s workforce diversity,&#8221; particularly through a more diverse development pool.</p>
<p>But the plaintiffs claim that while what they viewed to be the overt racism of the past has lessened and more black officers are being promoted to sergeants and lieutenants, the upper echelons of leadership are still predominantly white.</p>
<p>Five of the top 34 officers ranked captain or higher are black, and none is a black woman, they say.</p>
<p>At a press conference Tuesday, many of the black officers from the original case will unveil a new complaint against Frederick Herrera, a Capitol Police employment attorney. That claim will be added to more than a dozen spinoff retaliation cases after the Blackmon-Malloy filing.</p>
<p>They say Herrera willingly frustrated mediation efforts and participated in counseling sessions with employees who listed him specifically as the aggressor in discrimination claims.</p>

		<p>We should comply and just change their payroll procedure.  Send their paychecks to afrovoodoo owned banks in afrovoodooland and tell them to go back to africa if they want the money.  That&rsquo;s better than how we treated the slaves.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired of this &#8220;promote me because I&rsquo;m black&#8221; attitude. I&rsquo;ve never been promoted just because I&rsquo;m white. OTOH, maybe that is what I should demand. It seems to work for the blacks. Where and how do I file a discrimination suit for $100 million? I could sure use the money&hellip;or is that the real issue behind this nonsense?</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>This  ever-present religious tone strikes me as one of the most significant aspects of the black empowerment movement   &mdash;    (which I will not call the Civil Rights Movement, but rather the movement for black empowerment and eventual hegemony, which is exactly what it has turned out to be).</p>
<p>The pervasive influence of the black church, the ubiquitous presence of black &#8220;reverends&#8221;,  the prayers, the hymns, the candlelight marches &hellip; have been an immensely effective strategy, conspicuously lacking on the white right (or you could say, on the side of the white cause).</p>
<p>It gave them, the blacks, the clear image of a persecuted, patient, long-suffering people who were appealing merely for a little justice and fairness   &mdash;   people  who had decency and God on their side.</p>
<p>What image did we have instead?  Thanks to the media, on our side we had riot police, snarling dogs, truncheons, and firehoses.</p>
<p>This is what the world saw, and the world  made its choice as to whom to support. It was a massive propaganda victory for the blacks (and ultimately, all the &#8220;minorities&#8221;) against the hated, oppressive, white majority!</p>
<p>Knowing all of this already, I was further impressed with this realization when I saw the movie, &#8220;Hairspray&#8221; two or three times in fact. (I was a captive audience on a plane, so I had no choice; American was showing it on all their transatlantic flights.)  This was a trashy, but highly entertaining movie, aimed at the young,  with very catchy tunes,  great dancing, and top stars, which passed ostensibly  as &#8220;entertainment&#8221; but really was, beneatth the froth, blatant  propaganda for miscegenation. It was about Baltimore  in the crucial early days of integration, and the resistance it got from evil, benighted whites   &mdash;   paralleled by the dignity and quiet resolution of the pro-integrationists who carried the day.</p>
<p>In the movie, you had the requisite candlelight marches, hymns, and all of that. The blacks (with  their white lovers and supporters) were portrayed as kind, good, decent people   &mdash;   everything but saints with halos around their heads.  On the other side, the white segrationists were universally evil, dishonest, corrupt, venal, perverted, twisted, moral monsters.</p>
<p>It was the holy blacks (with a few decent whites), led by the saintly Queen Latifa, pitted against the evil (and  very blond) Michelle Pfeiffer.  Naturally, God and the blacks won the day while the evil whites and blonds went down to their justified perdition.</p>
<p>This production had been  a big Broadway hit and then a big movie!  What was the subliminal message that millions of gullible viewers (and young people) drew from this so-called entertainment?   Rather than steaming as I was, the viewers around me seemed to be enjoying the music and dancing, while  naively drinking in the accompanying race-mixing propaganda.</p>
<p>It struck me that we on the racial right have NOTHING to compare with this. Where are OUR reverends, our marches and candlelight vigils, our Broadway plays, our Hollywood movies, the  media sob stories about white victims, and the pictures of our aggrieved masses presenting their  lists of injustices? </p>
<p>Our lot has been a massive failure of propaganda (or the complete lack of it), while they (with the sympathy of Hollywood and the media) have advanced from one victory to another   &mdash;   at our expense.  We see the results today in an America that no longer looks like us and soon will  no longer be populated or owned by us.</p>
<p>But blacks will  find that the ultimate triumph of Diversity will not serve them well, when there is no longer a guilt-ridden white populace to mooch from and sustain them.  Asians have no wish to miscegenate with them,  and Hispanics have no intention  to support them.  What will blacks do then?</p>

		<p>As other posters here have said, bigoted blacks will be in for a very rude awakening when there is not enough white guilt and money to go around for their hateful, entitlement, &#8216;white man done me wrong and now he owes me&rsquo; mentality.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see the look on their face when browns and asians treat them worse than they were treated during the days of segregation.</p>

<p>True enough.</p>
<p>And the core of the problem.</p>
<p>The civil rights movement in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s was a master of exploiting the media. And they have had much of the mainstream media on their side ever since. </p>
<p>But this is where the Internet comes in. It gives unlimited opportunities for dissent to be expressed, as well as for the distribution of alternative productions.</p>
<p>But the critical thing is to get media savvy.  And to get educated on how to employ the media. And look at what the upcoming generation of cybernetic explorers are up to. </p>
<p>Consider how the governments of Egypt and Tunisia had a lockdown on the old media in their country, yet rebels were able to use the new media to overthrow them&hellip;</p>

		<p>Hard to believe that a case that has slogged on for over 10 years has much merit&hellip;.  Usually if there&rsquo;s really a case, it does get to court in a reasonable amount of time.  This sounds like the Al and Jesse foot-draggin&rsquo; boogie&hellip;.</p>

<p>How many are Chinese? Armenian? Portugese? Latvian? Russian? Female and Irish? Female and Hispanic? Gay and Black? </p>
<p>Blacks always think they&rsquo;re the only ones in the world and that they&rsquo;re always being stepped on.</p>
