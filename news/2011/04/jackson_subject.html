<h1><a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/jackson-push-bennett-lawsuit-119861339.html">Jackson Subject of Gay Harassment Complaint</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BJ Lutz, NBC Chicago, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former employee of the Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. at the Rainbow Push Coalition has filed a bombshell wrongful termination and discrimination complaint against the civil rights leader with the City of Chicago&rsquo;s Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed sometime last year by Tommy R. Bennett, a regular on the Tom Joynder Radio show and member of Barack Obama&rsquo;s LGBT Leadership Council, includes shocking allegations about Jackson&rsquo;s behavior toward the openly gay staffer including an allegation that the civil rights leader propositioned him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bennett, 55, claims Jackson ridiculed him in front of other employees and required him to perform &#8220;humiliating tasks&#8221; like escorting women to Jackson&rsquo;s various hotel rooms, cleaning up after alleged trysts and packing his clothing.  It also includes an allegation that Jackson asked for oral sex, according to the claim. Jackson flatly denied each claim in his response.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In that capacity, Bennett alleges to &#8220;clean his [hotel] room after sexual intercourse with women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bennett&rsquo;s complaint requests back and front pay, compensation for emotional distress and punitive damages all to the tune of roughly $450,000.  Bennett also wants an amendment to the civil rights organization&rsquo;s non-discrimination policy to include sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if this guy&rsquo;s telling the truth.</p>
<p>And even if he&rsquo;s lying it&rsquo;s still wonderful to see a litigious, money-grubbing con artist get a taste of his own medicine.</p>

		<p>Back in 1968 JJ showed off a shirt with blood on it which he claimed was the blood of the assassinated MLK. That was shown to be a lie. But he has gone his merry way all these years as a darling of the media, unhindered by any close scrutiny of his essentially corrupt and fraudulent nature.<br>
If you get the fuller details of this episode by checking around you&rsquo;ll find the story to be even more tawdry than this cleaned up version.                                                              His son JJ Jr also recently had some scandal himself, being revealed as having had financial backers flying in some out of town call girls as a favor to him.            Remember when he was acting as Bill Clinton&rsquo;s &#8220;spiritual adviser&#8221; during the time the president was having a Monica problem? What a laugh that was.    </p>

<p>I flipped through a book in the 1990s by a white flight attendant. The book was mostly about all the famous men she slept with. She was a big leftist and was excited when she heard Jesse Jackson was going to be on her flight. But when he got on he just threw his coat at her and said &#8220;pick it up&#8221; when it fell. He then proceeded to order her around like a slave for the whole flight.</p>
<p>By the way, given what we know about blacks in prison, I believe it is 100% true that Jesse asked this guy for oral sex.</p>

		<p>The government probably pays Jackson and Sharpton to control the black community so they won&rsquo;t riot.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they do it is killed in the media.  Our government buys off leaders so they can control them.  They raise a little hell but it is no where near the problems there would be with full scale rioting and looting.  Any black race hustler knows that.  Its like you paying protection from the very people you need protection from.</p>

<p>Love the analogy, but what about Kobe Bryant&rsquo;s &#8220;gay slur&#8221; hoopla?  The PC police have already elevated blacks to a protected class above reproach, so their next target is the gays, who have undoubtedly [sarc. on] suffered tremendously under the power-structure of the white-male elite hetero-Judeo-Christian framework [sarc. off].  </p>

		<p>There are so many more important things than what a gay man says is true and what a black preacher refuses to down-low admit to.</p>
<p>That this took a year to percolate up to the surface of a slow news day says to me that it&rsquo;s second rate tabloid drivel unworthy of AmRen.</p>
<p>That said, when will it be that the presumed political power of blacks is so trumped by -something else-, more urgent, that the assumption that a black racist preacher will get away with a quiet OOC settlement no longer matters as a digressive sidebar?</p>
<p>We ignore the Libyan/Iraq/Afghan fiasco which is well north of a trillion dollars in spending now.  We ignore an oil rig which is &#8216;suddenly&rsquo; leaking oil until a presidential order to shut down all coastal drilling operations makes it&rsquo;s way through Congress without argument (and a year later, the oil in the Gulf is so neglible that the prior numbers can only have been faked).  We ignore another trillion dollars in slave reparations as &#8216;stimulus&rsquo; whose debt is another Chinese anchor around our foundering nation.  We ignore Knoxville Horrors.  Indeed we ignore a media which is controlled, almost exclusively, by one ethnic group yet seems to pathologically race-biased in favor of covering up the criminal propensities of another group (a group which publically hates them).  We ignore &#8216;the most open administration ever!&rsquo; which has yet to produce a simple birth certificate or open transcripts for man who has the most important job title in America.  We ignore black favoritism in relief of failed institutions and federal agencies.  We ignore the racial causes of the failure of banks and loan institutions in utterly devaluing five top stock market firms selling real estate loan guarantees as AAA secured debt instruments.</p>
<p>How long do we excuse &#8216;social causes&rsquo; for the genetics of a one median standard deviation in IQ, which makes a total farce of &#8216;equal pursuit, not guaranteed result&rsquo; as quota secured, middle class, civil service jobs solely for the lowest intelligence ethny in America?</p>
<p>How long do we invent &#8216;racist&rsquo; sociological reasons for an 85% out of wedlock birthrate?  52% of the murders by 6% of the total adult male population?  8X the property crime of whites by this same 6% who are black?</p>
<p>HOW LONG MUST WE CONTINUE TO FIXATE ON THE TRIVIAL WHILE IGNORING THE REAL ELEMENTS OF BLACK CRIMINAL SOCIOPATHY IN AMERICA?</p>
<p>I want to know so that I can go away and come back into the conversation when everyone is finally ready to start talking about what -are- the important racial elements presently ruining our society.</p>
