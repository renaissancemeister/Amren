			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Simon Neville, Daily Mail (London), April 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman at the centre of the Duke University lacrosse player rape scandal has been charged with trying to kill her boyfriend, police said.</p>
<p>Crystal Mangum is accused of stabbing the man, named locally as Reggie Wilson, in the chest after an argument in the early hours of Sunday morning in the apartment they share in Durham, North Carolina.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, while Wilson was recovering in hospital.</p>
<p>According to Anthony McCullough, Wilson&rsquo;s cousin, he said the couple had only been dating for a few months but that the 46-year-old was excited.</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;I told him, with her background, you should be careful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latest arrest comes a year after Mangum was found guilty of child abuse and resisting arrest, among other charges.</p>
<p>She was arrested after smashing the windscreen and slashing the tyres of her then-boyfriend&rsquo;s car, before going on to set fire to his clothes while her children were in their home.</p>
<p>At the time she claimed her then-boyfriend had attacked her, which a jury dismissed, but found her innocent of arson.</p>
<p>In 2006, she hit the headlines when she claimed three Duke Lacrosse players sexually assaulted her at a party</p>
<p>Duke University lacrosse players Reade Seligmann, Dave Evans and Collin Finnerty were accused of raping her while she was working as a stripper at a party thrown by the team, the Duke Blue Devils.</p>
<p>The case caused a media storm over allegations of racism.</p>
<p>It was alleged the players had asked only for white or Hispanic strippers, but became angry when two black dancers turned up. </p>
<p>Prosecutor Mike Nifong indicted the three on charges of rape, sexual assault and kidnapping.</p>
<p>The university suspended the players, sacked the team&rsquo;s coach and eventually cancelled the entire lacrosse season.</p>
<p>But the case fell apart because of a lack of evidence and Nifong was forced to resign after scathing criticism over his handling of it.</p>
<p>Last year Mangum was found guilty of child abuse when she smashed her then-boyfriend&rsquo;s car and burned his clothes while her children were in the house</p>
<p>He was convicted for contempt amid accusations he withheld DNA evidence and made false inflammatory statements about the players to the media.</p>
<p>State prosecutors who took over the case cleared all three of the charges, saying there had been a &#8216;rush to accuse&rsquo; by Nifong.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the three sued the university over their handling of the scandal, and received an undisclosed settlement.</p>
<p>At the time Duke University said it settled to &#8216;eliminate the possibility of future litigation&rsquo;, and said it deeply regretted what the students had gone through.</p>

		<p>We cherish stories like this- our heart jumps for joy when the Diversity be kepp&rsquo;en itsef real and authen-tik and vi-brent, you know whu&rsquo;em say&rsquo;n?</p>
<p>Where is the Duke 88 now that she really needs them to come to her rescue and raise a defense fund?  Anybody? Nothing? Why the silence?</p>
<p>When will Jesse and Al and Whoopi and Ophra and Michelle hold the candle light prayer vigil for the injustice against this oppressed and misunderstood 21st century Rosa Parks?</p>
<p>And why have we failed to hold the media accountable to use the rhetoric trick of inapplicable cause-and-effect in this case?  Should we demand that they point out that Mangum is &#8220;enduring another of life&rsquo;s hardships&#8221; on the anniversary day of MLK&rsquo;s assassination?  Didn&rsquo;t MLK losing his life to lift her up out of the ghetto?  Why did he waste his sacrifice for Mangum?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget, and let me be clear, James Earl Ray was the worst race traitor since John Brown and John Wilkes Booth.</p>
<p>But for Ray, we would have had the pleasure of seeing MLK carried to the pokey in handcuffs for embezzlement of SCLC funds. Then the felony conviction.  Instead, we got MLK Day all year long for the rest of our miserable White lives in our blackafrovoodoo formerly Whites Only Republic.</p>
<p>James Earl Ray is to blame for losing his mind on 4/4/1968 and doing the WRONG THING!   We&rsquo;ll never undo the damage&hellip;</p>

I was growing increasingly angry as I read his piece because of the way the narrative was being presented but I REALLY blew my top when I read this:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But the case fell apart because of a lack of evidence&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Lack of evidence&#8221;? There was NO evidence because NOTHING HAPPENED! There was NO CASE!</p>
<p>&#8220;Allegations of racism&#8221; and yet no mention of the faculty lynching these young men with NO EVIDENCE!</p>
<p>I could go through this paragraphy by paragraphy but what&rsquo;s the point. </p>

		<p>Not surprised.  </p>
<p>Here in Detroit a man was buying condoms in a store and starting joking with another guy about how he had the girls he was going to have sex with out in his car.  </p>
<p>The other guy goes out to look at the girls in the car and one was his daughter!  So, naturally, he pulls out a gun and starts shooting.  He shot his daughter in the spine, the guy buying the condoms pulls out his own gun and shot the dad and killed him.  PS&hellip;.Dad was was on parole.  On my father&rsquo;s grave that is a true story.  </p>
<p>They also rob our firement here in Detroit.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone one here have the slightest sympathy for the victim?  BTW, as this story was breaking, the Reverend William Barber (NC NAACP President) who was at the head of the caterwauling chorus line banging pots and pans with the Duke 88 when the Duke Lacrosse Team &#8220;Rape&#8221; story was breaking found &#8220;hisself&#8221; on &#8220;the down low&#8221; in neighboring Chapel Hill dressed in twenty yards of purple cloth cleric&rsquo;s robes delivering pontifications to the last remaining fools in NC on the commemoration of the assasination of MLK. As to Jesse and Al&rsquo;s whereabouts, who knows?</p>

		<p>The Duke students were representing their college.  As with any star athlete, like it or not, you are in the spotlight 100% of the time and your actions must similarly reflect your integrity as pride of place.</p>
<p>They should have known better than to debase themselves and their university by associating themselves with such things as &#8216;exotic dancers&rsquo;.  This is one of the principles of responsibility that goes with being titled a _gentleman_ athlete.</p>
<p>That it happened at an off campus location and without any hope of (other, non-ethnic, women as counter testimony) should itself have been something we took our boys to task with in _no uncertain terms_.  Behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The whites were at fault that night.</p>
<p>For not exercising due diligence of caution as preservation of the rights of free association with those closer to their own class and racial ethics. </p>
<p>As for this fine example of African mores, I do not see why we remain so obsessed with further demeaning a woman who has already clearly abased herself out of any human tolerance let alone respect.</p>
<p>Let it go.</p>

		<p>What never makes sense about these &#8220;Racist White Rapist&#8221; hate crime hoaxes is what must be glaringly obvious to supporters of Amren.  White Racialists aren&rsquo;t particularly attracted to other races, particularly blacks and aren&rsquo;t going to be titilated by watching them. They aren&rsquo;t likely to want to pay money to watch a striptease or perform an act of procreation that leads to a race anihilating mullato.   The &#8220;racist white rapist&#8221; is a mythological invention, a projection of lurid immaginings, resentments, scapegoating and a desire to find hypocrisy in racislists.</p>

		<p>If Magnum doesn&rsquo;t get herself on some Prozac, she&rsquo;s not going to live to be 35, let alone 40.</p>
<p>The Duke players Magnum falsely accused must be smiling about this, though.  She got a free pass on felony obstruction of justice, she later got a free pass on arson in an occupied building, and now she&rsquo;s stabbed someone.  She&rsquo;s not only crazy, she&rsquo;s self-destructing, and I&rsquo;ll bet those lacrosse players are just delighted she hasn&rsquo;t got any way to take them with her.</p>

		<p>12:  A bunch of young men in college hire strippers.  (Next thing you know, they&rsquo;ll be telling us that people under 21 drink on college campuses.)  What a shocking thing, huh?  That&rsquo;s obviously much worse than lying about being raped, and causing a race row in the process.</p>

		<p>A few idle thoughts&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Where are the race pimps now rushing to her defense? Oh wait, their not.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a stripper? I sure don&rsquo;t find her remotely attractive.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll get in more trouble sooner or later. Make book on that.</p>
<p>One final thought. She would have been ignored by the media, etc, had she been a white stripper making such blatantly false claims. She would also have been dealt with more harshly by the justice system. There is a lesson here. I&rsquo;m not condoning this type of thing, but if you are white, and you have a stag, frat party, etc, and you are going to have female &#8216;entertainment&rsquo; make absolutley SURE the girls are white. Don&rsquo;t leave yourself vulnerable to this type of thing.</p>

		<p>To anonymous 12. </p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t agree with the Duke lacrossers getting strippers for a party, they in fact requested white dancers, and in fact the whole fracas began after they told the black strippers they wanted white ones.</p>
<p>Stories like this should be published.  Mangum became famous (although the media wouldn&rsquo;t mention her name) because she lied about being raped, a thing I put on par with being raped.  She destroyed the lives of 3 men, Duke LAX lost its coach and season, and race relations became more strained.  She doesn&rsquo;t get a pass.</p>

<p>  I believe the Duke Lacrosse players had originally requested a white stripper but got the &#8220;desirable&#8221; and &#8220;beautiful&#8221; Ms. Crystal Mangum instead  &mdash;   not that I approve of their behavior. <br>
I wonder if Crystal Mangum will continue her free college education (given by her supporters: Sharpton, Jackson, Oprah, etc.,) online while in prison?
