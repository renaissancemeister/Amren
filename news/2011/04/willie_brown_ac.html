<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/us/17bcshort.html?_r=1">Willie Brown Academy, Born in 1992 With High Hopes, Will Close in May, a Failure</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Gollan, New York Times, April 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the school now known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. College Preparatory Academy opened in San Francisco&rsquo;s predominantly black Bayview neighborhood some 18 years ago, it was at the forefront of an ambitious effort to address school performance and segregation without busing children out of the neighborhood. {snip}</p>
<p>But those dreams have been thoroughly dashed, and the 160-student school is set to close May 27, largely as a result of chronic student underachievement and high truancy. And for those unfortunate enough to be a part of its final months, conditions have gone from bad to worse.</p>
<p>Parents, teachers and some officials acknowledge a breakdown in teaching and discipline. Students roam the hallways during class time. One teacher has often shown movies rather than press ahead with science lessons. A pack of students looted the school store, with impunity.</p>

<p>Primitives DO NOT want a learning, disciplined environment.  They&rsquo;ve spent the last 5000 years in a hunter/gatherer stage and haven&rsquo;t evolved beyond that.  The only people who can&rsquo;t understand that are the deceivers who want everyone to believe the only difference in humans is skin color, because they&rsquo;ve been deluded by the lie themselves.   </p>

<p><i>&ldquo;My son was unable to live up to his highest potential at this school,&rdquo; said Ms. Taylor, a nursing staffing coordinator. &ldquo;I am so happy that he won&rsquo;t be attending that school any more.&rdquo;

<p>As if the condition of the building were the cause of its students&rsquo; massive failure! The new school will be filled with the same substandard student material, and the cycle will begin all over again.  And everyone will throw up their hands and pretend not to understand why.<br>

		<p>Watch MSNBC and listen to all the rich liberal White elites claiming that &#8220;more investment in education and opportunities for African Americans is the urgent Civil Rights issue of today&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then remember what a real White Man said about educational opportunities:  &#8220;Those who respond to education get more of it; those who don&rsquo;t respond get less.&#8221;  William Gayley Simpson, Which Way Western Man.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve obviously gone the wrong way when Whites who dabble in Civil Rights, like teenager girls dabble in Astrology, are at the top, and good, AmRen Christian Whites like ourselves are pushed to the bottom, and afrovoodoos are elevated above us.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Jonathan Woahn, a seventh-grade math teacher, noted that few top district leaders had set foot in the school after announcing last year that it would close. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The kids rule the school,&rdquo; Mr. Woahn said. &ldquo;I think administrators just want us to hold on through the rest of the school year; there are no expectations beyond that.&rdquo; <br>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Marylin Taylor, whose son Romeo Reeves is an eighth grader at Willie Brown, agreed. Ms. Taylor said staff members took an indifferent approach not only to students, letting them run through the hallways and &ldquo;holler,&rdquo; but also sometimes to parents. She said she had left two messages recently with the principal&rsquo;s office to discuss her son&rsquo;s academic progress but had not received a return call. <br>

&ldquo;It is not ideal,&rdquo; Ms. Gray said, &ldquo;but the alternative to doing what we are doing now was to close the school in December, which would have displaced the kids midyear. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Learning is the main focus. Now, how much of it is happening? It&rsquo;s difficult at this time. But we have not given up.&rdquo; <br>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Jill Wynns, a school board member, said the district had tried mightily to raise student achievement. But the school has languished in recent years and been judged harshly under the rules of the federal No Child Left Behind Act. </p>

<p>One 64 year old black nostalgia queen with &#8216;more to give and more to say&rsquo; as a vested career move interest in a failed black school.  And the practical, intelligent, whites have seen the writing on the wall for a year or more already.</p>
<p>This is why we have to pull out of the public run infrastructure on the road to separation overall.  Vouchers and professional skills salaries will get white kids the education they need.  Residual public education &#8216;institutions&rsquo; will give ethnics the day care they deserve.</p>

		<p>I worked in a school like that for a time.  Kids roaming the halls, yelling, invading classroom, fights every day, vandalism and theft, etc.)  I got the heck out of there when I found the opportunity.  The turnover of staff there was over 50% per year!</p>
<p>You have not lived - no, you cannot fathom the utter uselessness of teaching in an urban minority school, until you&rsquo;ve spent a few days with black students.</p>
<p>Imagine a room of 25-35 &#8216;students&rsquo;.  Here is the typical breakdown I had:</p>
<p>1. 2-3 students are at grade level, but are so frustrated with the non-stop antics of the rest, they are hopelessly jaded and act out too.</p>
<p>2.  At least 20-30% of the students are &#8220;over age&#8221;.  I mean like, they&rsquo;re 18 years old and in ninth grade!  Most are so beyond hope it&rsquo;s breathtaking.  I had a 19 year old man (drug addict, gang banger) in a ninth grade class one year.  He got kicked out finally after getting caught smoking a joint in the back of the class.  Needless to say these men prey upon the young girls like you would NOT BELIEVE!</p>
<p>3.  At least 20% of the class is made up of emotionally disturbed individuals who are just nutso.  You fear for your safety.  I had a student break a chair and threaten to stab me in one class.  For what?  I asked him one time (nicely) if he could tone down his random rapping in the middle of my lesson.</p>
<p>4.  The rest are a various menagerie of dimwits, gangbangers and borderline retarded individuals.  Almost everyone is 3-4 or more grade levels behind where a typical white kid would be, even a poor one from a small town who grew up in a trailer park.</p>
<p>Now you go and and do a &#8220;Freedom Writers&#8221; thing and turn them into scholars!  Not going to happen (and I bet most of those &#8216;Freedom Writers&rsquo; students wound up NOT turning out in the long run.)  With all the testing mania going on - who in their right mind would volunteer to teach in such classrooms knowing that there&rsquo;s a good chance they will lose their job because DeQuan and Shaniqua can&rsquo;t get it together?<br>
  <br>
It is beyond description, and they are our future.  (Sobs.)</p>

		<p>  Incredible! How can this have happened? Was the school properly funded?  I just have trouble believing that given such an opportunity, black students didn&rsquo;t excel, and go on to graduate and make their marks in medicine, law and engineering. The only possible explanation is that this school was not adequately supported, and in fact was probably sabotaged, by the white community.</p>
<p>Quote from a satisfied parent:</p>
<p>The school building itself is in horrible condition. Within the last couple of years, they have had mold and mildew licensed professionals cleaning with no notice to the parents of their findings. The building itself truly needs a total rehab. in addition to some of the staff. I have personally sat in &hellip;  Read more the office where I saw with my own eyes, no control of students behavior, language etc. You have a large 8th grade class this year were only a hand full of students are graduating. That is alarming to me as a parent. The only time you here from the school personal is when they have issues with your child. Then when you address your concern the staff memebers make every attempt to over talk you. I am so happy my daughter is going to another school. I would not recommend this school to anyone seeking an education</p>

<i>&#8220;When the school now known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. College Preparatory Academy&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I always love these hifalutin names they give black schools like &#8216;The Martin Luther King JR Academy of Excellence and High Achievement&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s all done on the theory that this will raise black kids self-esteem. Funny how white folk built rockets and satellites with educations from school with names like &#8220;PS 27&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yet another achievement theory bites the dust.</p>
<p>The school will close <i>&#8220;largely as a result of chronic student underachievement and high truancy.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The Buffalo News just ran a piece on school attendance. My formerly white high school (now majority black and Hispanic) stands at about 75%. On average, 1 out of 4 kids doesn&rsquo;t even bother going to school.</p>
<p>Black and Hispanic parents are &#8216;outraged&rsquo; that the Buffalo school system &#8220;won&rsquo;t&#8221; teach their children.</p>
<p>Note to parents: Your children have to be in school to learn.<br>

		<p>Interesting that an article in the New York Times discusses a school in San Francisco. The media in SF covered the announcement of the school closing with very few specifics as I recall. Several employees of the school district have told me that this school building is very vandalized and in terrible shape. Of course local media must always be PC and never tell the entire truth. I am glad to be a regular reader of AR so that I can know what is happening in my hometown.</p>

But what gets me most, is I know white liberal educators, and relatives of same, who acknowledge these things, get abused, yet shrug&hellip;they CAN NOT renounce one element of multiculturalism. They are marxists to the bone, and are apparently unable to wake up.<br>

		<p>I often wonder why during segregation, students who attended separate schools for Blacks often did better there than at integrated schools. Could it be that there were parents back then who cared about their children&rsquo;s education and made them study when they came home from school instead of watching tv.</p>

		<p>Contrast this school with the one that I attended in a large northeastern city; the time as the late 1950&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>1-The school system was poorly funded, but run by &#8220;evil&#8221; white people who were  committed to providing as much education as possible with the resources available.</p>
<p>2-Disruptive students were isolated in &#8220;special classes&#8221;</p>
<p>3-Students over 15 who were only taking up space were expelled; students over 16 who were not benefiting from the school were gently expelled; students over 17 who would not graduate that year were encouraged to leave; there were no students over 18, except some returnees.</p>
<p>4-My H.S. was about 40% black. Their behaviour was not disruptive. Their graduation percentage was less than other students, but those who graduated were qualified for productive employment. These jobs were available even though Affirmative Action was only a liberal dream.</p>
<p>5-Blacks, then as now, were expert gripers, but I heard no complaints about racial discrimination, and there was none. </p>

		<p>Thanks to bussing, I attended such a school for one long year back in the 70&rsquo;s.  The do-gooders thought it would be great for whites to be transported to a ruined black area many miles away to attend school.  Crime, open drug use, hallway dancing with dj&rsquo;s, stabbings, etc.  Learning?  Little.  I was mugged in the hallway and had my yearbook stolen the last day of school.  By two of them.  I had never seen either before.  I had several photos published in that yearbook, a trade I learned previously in my neighborhood (white) school.  Wonder in what landfill that yearbook is mouldering now?</p>
<p>Before undergoing that I wondered why so many of my friends were put in private schools rather than go through that.  Afterwards I understood, &amp; then some.</p>
<p>Thanks to the do-gooders I did get an education though.  About what black &#8220;african-americans&#8221; are truly all about.  That knowledge has helped me ever since.</p>

		<p>Nowadays you have places like Taco Bell asking if you want to give a dollar to help kids graduate.  Say what&hellip;?  How is money going to help someone graduate?  As the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you can&rsquo;t make them drink.</p>
<p>I got lunch at reduced cost due to my parents&rsquo; income (Dad was disabled), yet I was in some accelerated classes, and I managed to squeak through with a 3.5 GPA (though if I&rsquo;d applied myself I could have done better, I freely admit).  So much for poverty taking away opportunities.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed at my Detroit-area high school, from which I graduated 20 years ago:  We had security guards, but they were about 99% black.  Black students would skip class and sit in the commons area chatting it up with the security guards.  What a joke.</p>

		<p>I have to agree, This Is White Racism.<br>
All you have to do is look at Detroit and Oakland to name just two places to see the greatness of the afrocentric individual.<br>
Once they get rid of the whites holding them back the city is reborn into a heaven on earth.<br>
So many times I read where the black invented this or that but when I investigate, it always turns out to be a lie.<br>
It seems as if blacks are the only creatures who crave to be where they are not wanted, why is this?<br>
I just can not find any evidence of any place on the planet Earth that improves with the influx of the afro race.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the problem, the standards were too high and they actually required students to attend.</p>

<p>Thanks to bussing, I attended such a school for one long year back in the 70&rsquo;s. The do-gooders thought it would be great for whites to be transported to a ruined black area many miles away to attend school. Crime, open drug use, hallway dancing with dj&rsquo;s, stabbings, etc. Learning? Little. I was mugged in the hallway and had my yearbook stolen the last day of school. By two of them. I had never seen either before. I had several photos published in that yearbook, a trade I learned previously in my neighborhood (white) school. Wonder in what landfill that yearbook is mouldering now?<br>

Unfortunately, this story is not getting out. Even FOX News and Rush Limbaugh are reluctant to talk about the blackboard and asphalt jungles blacks create whenever they are in the majority. </p>

		<p><i>I often wonder why during segregation, students who attended separate schools for Blacks often did better there than at integrated schools. Could it be that there were parents back then who cared about their children&rsquo;s education and made them study when they came home from school instead of watching tv.</i></p>
<p><br>
One might note that in those terrible days, the rates of illegitimacy across the board were much lower, and thus you actually did have <i>parents  </i>  (emphasis on the plural) who might get their children interested in education and keep them disciplined. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not simply the liberal education and busing policies which are responsible for the collapse of black education, but also the sexual revolution, something which is still being pushed by liberals via their celebration of diverse sexual lifestyles. </p>
<p>As usual, liberal policies lead to debacle, yet liberals turn a blind eye to them and keep pushing the same cycle of self-destruction. </p>
<p>What is amazing is how what all those conservatives used to say way back when, that the family is the foundation of civilization, seems to actually have some credibility.</p>

		<p>It tears my heart out to see these fine young blacks, who hunger for an education above all other things having their Rock Of Ages (School) stolen away from them, all the while knowing it was a white person somewhere and somehow who destroyed their dreams of greatness. It is rare not to see blacks with their noses buried in books trying everything within their power to become more educated. The love and hunger for knowledge and success.</p>
<p>White people ( Stand Back ) get out of their way so they can become the next generation of Doctors, Teachers, Scientists that we need so much. Who knows what greatness WE as Caucasians are holding back with our racist attitudes?</p>

		<p>The poster, Jay, knows exactly what he&rsquo;s talking about  &mdash;  most of my 9th grade students read at a 4-6th grade level (the smart ones). I have seen exactly two students in the last year who were above grade level in reading comprehension, and they were pains because they could not learn in that environment. </p>
<p>Right before spring break, two kids got into a fight in my room. One flipped a desk and threw a chair. Did administration suspend him? Heck, no. He calmed down, you see, so he was ok to go back to class. </p>
<p>I think a lot of these wild kids are mentally ill, and have never gotten diagnosed. Even the &#8220;bad&#8221; &#8220;normal&#8221; kids are frightened of them  &mdash;  when a litle thug is scared of a particular kid in your classroom, watch out! </p>

		<p>The reason you have so many 18-20 year olds in high school is because because of their failure to attend school and pass their classes, they do not have enough credits to graduate. They of course, blamed the school for not graduating. I graduated from high school 39 years ago this june and I remember from the time I was a sophomore, I had a list of classes that I needed to take to graduate and attend college. And I took all of those classes and more to graduate. I think that many of those students could not pass the GED so they take up space in these classrooms hoping that they would get a diploma someday.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>One wonders what pathologies are being bred in today&rsquo;s society. </p>
<p>What are some of the factors do you see as contributing to this?</p>

		<p>Strange that they named it for Willie Brown.</p>
<p>He is a White woman chasing typical black racist politician but, he graduated from high school, college and law school and passed the bar exam years before affirmative action came along.  He did as well as the Whites in his classes.He established a successful private, not government affirmative action practice.</p>
<p>He never was a government lawyer.  He started a little neighborhood law practice with mostly black clients and did well.</p>
<p>He was a great negotiator and courtroom attorney.  He did a lot of work for black and White businesses.</p>
<p>He raised three kids who behaved and did well in school.  This was in the 1970&rsquo;s when most black kids were encouraged to behave badly.  He told his kids that whatever they did reflected on him and reminded them that San Francisco is a small town.</p>
<p>These young criminals who destroyed the school are the exact opposite of Willie&rsquo;s behavior and that of his own kids.</p>
<p>But what can one expect?</p>

		<p>I suppose that the school was named for Willie Brown  to give the young thugs the role model of a successful black man.</p>
<p>Black kids don&rsquo;t admire black lawyers, Mayors and elected officials like Willie Brown.  They admire the felonious athletes and the thugs and criminals in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>If the young Willie with his coke bottle glasses, short slim size, after school jobs, polite demeanor and good grades were magically time machine transferred to the present day Willie Brown Academy he would probably be beaten to death for his glasses and acting White.  Those who beat him to death would be 8 inches taller and 75 pounds heavier than the short slim teen age Willie.</p>
