			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>St. Louis Today, April 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police said this afternoon that an elderly man was beaten to death as part of a game involving &#8220;unprovoked attacks on innocent bystanders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elex Levell Murphy, 18, of the 5400 block of Geraldine Avenue, was charged today with one count each of first-degree murder and first-degree assault and two counts of armed criminal action, according to court records. A judge has ordered him held without bail.</p>
<p>According to court records, Murphy and three other people aproached Hoang D. Nguyen, 72, and his wife, Yen, in an alley at the 3800 block of Spring Avenue at 10:45 a.m. Saturday as they headed home from a nearby Vietnamese market on the city&rsquo;s south side.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yen Nguyen told authorities that Murphy walked up to her husband, Hoang Nguyen, grabbed his jacket in the front and punched him in the head, causing him to fall to the ground. A second man kicked him in the abdomen causing injury to his ribs. Murphy then walked up to Yen Nguyen and punched her in the eye, causing severe bruises and an orbital fracture.</p>
<p>Hoang Nguyen later died of his injuries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Murphy was taken into custody Tuesday. In an interview with police, he made a statement placing himself at the scene. He also told authorities that the attack was part of the &#8220;Knock-out Game,&#8221; which he said targets innocent people, court records say.</p>

		<p>The neighborhood where this happened has a strange mix of the last vestiges of native born whites, and some Indochinese (mainly Vietnamese) refugees from the Vietnam War, and a lot of blacks who are gradually colonizing the area in their natural spread from points northward, and some Bosnian refugees from 1998-1999.</p>
<p>The main reason why this could happen at all a week ago Saturday morning in the late morning, (usually a time when most ghetto dwellers are asleep), is that so many cops were drained out of the south half of the city to protect the white liberals in an entertainment/restaurant district from black crime that happened a week before, the now infamous Loop mini-riot, for those of you familiar.  In other words, the white liberals wanted to be able to swill booze in the Loop while not having to be bothered by the diversity they love so much.  They even get police protection ahead of other non-whites, so it seems.</p>

<p>Because they are WHITE! The genocide is ONLY against Whites. Asians, mexicans, arabs, etc can all be against miscegenation, but it is ONLY the White race that is targeted when they try to stay away from blacks, etc. It was all PLANNED to be this way for a reason. Their reason.</p>

<p>And people WONDER why no one wants to live around black people, even other black people.  I think we need to start an organization, a civil rights organization, that forces liberal white areas to accept diversity.  What a smoke screen that would be to protect our conservative, regular American communities and teach the liberals about the joys of diversity, since they keep it at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity- &#8220;protect the white liberals in an entertainment/restaurant district from black crime&hellip;&#8221;  What?</p>
<p>So now people who go out to eat, etc. are the dreaded &#8220;liberals who deserve it&#8221;, too?  Gee, the perimeters of where a race realist can move before we deserve to be beaten and killed by blacks are getting very narrow, indeed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing more and more of this &#8220;they deserve it- they might be liberals&#8221; stuff on this site every day.  If we go to a theatre or club, restaurant or bar, take a train or the bus, for God&rsquo;s sake, if we live in a city at all; you name it- we deserve to be beaten to a pulp by blacks. Because only liberals do these things.  Right.  FYI- some people don&rsquo;t drive.  Many disabilities restrict one from that- for some, it&rsquo;s economics.  One&rsquo;s politics don&rsquo;t have much of anything to do with being stuck on the bus.  Some of us aren&rsquo;t old, and we would like to go out.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t much standing up for your own kind, IMHO.  Everybody should be able to go out of the house and not be beaten, raped, or killed regardless.  We should be able to use the public facilities and streets WE pay for and not lectured or accused.  Personally, I think whites should have as much right to be in public no matter what their politics. </p>
<p>So, I guess you aren&rsquo;t a real race realist if you don&rsquo;t move to a mountain top, hole up with an arsenal, and drive an armored truck.  If that&rsquo;s what is required to get people to care about issues surrounding our race, I fear you will be small in number.</p>

		<p>Their so called random attacks never seem to be upon Brock Lesnar or Chuck Lidell.  I suspect they prey on elderly weak targets or white boys with no self esteem.  If white people would fight back, these &#8220;courageous&#8221; fools would run like cowards.  My father was a paratrooper in WW2 but became a priest after the war.   He always told me blacks never messed with him because he carried himself like he would be tough to take.  I think whites need to start taking a pound of flesh off each attacker.</p>

<p>On the night side of the reading comprehension bell curve, are we?  Or did my words hit home for some reason?  Either way, you know I didn&rsquo;t say that white liberals didn&rsquo;t deserve police protection.  It&rsquo;s that they didn&rsquo;t deserve it in spite of everyone else.  It very well could have been an elderly white couple walking down that alley at 10:45 AM Saturday before last.  Or it could have been a older white very race realist man who I know lives in that neighborhood, on his way to picking up groceries at a grocery store within walking distance.  Because the cops were pretty much drained out of the southern (and whiter) half of St. Louis City, you know that black crime against whites and others shot sky high last weekend   &mdash;   This one against the elderly Vietnamese was just the only one that was homicidal (or the only one they tell us was homicidal.)   </p>
<p>Too, if you truly know the kinds of whacked out white liberals who live around there (Washington University district) and patronize that area&rsquo;s establishments, then you&rsquo;d know the whole hypocrisy of giving them extra protection from the 70%+ white SLPD and the even whiter University City P.D., to protect them from black crime.  These are the ilk of people that held a &#8220;Free Mumia&#8221; rally about a dozen years ago in that very area!</p>
<p>You said that &#8220;If that&rsquo;s what is required to get people to care about issues surrounding our race, I fear you will be small in number.&#8221;  Actually, what it&rsquo;s going to take is for these white liberals to get mugged by black reality so often and so viciously that it just wake them out of their drunken dogmatic pseudo-religious egalitarian stooper.  And that won&rsquo;t happen as long as they&rsquo;re so tightly protected, hypocritically so.</p>
<p>8:</p>
<p>The difference is that in the years after WWII, it was still not yet de facto or de jure illegal for whites to defend themselves against black crime and do what it takes to deter future attacks.  And the effort to psychologically bamboozle whites really didn&rsquo;t hit its stride until a few decades later.  Also, because the segregationist system was still strong in the Deep South, strong enough in the mid-South and still very mildly enforced everywhere else, and in places it was jettisoned, it had not been that long ago that it was in effect, blacks still feared the quick and rapid reprisal of the big black police baton.  </p>

		<p>You know, there is an endless liberal self-flagellation over White violence against blacks during the segregation era. Yet here we have systemic and senseless race based violence which seemingly goes unremarked. Think this will make it into a movie or Public TV documentary? Compare the media coverage of this kind of senseless racially based violence today with movies such as &#8220;Rosewood.&#8221; </p>
<p><i>I think we need to start an organization, a civil rights organization, that forces liberal white areas to accept diversity. </i></p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>White people, out of sheer survival, need to organize on the same level as do minorities: legal defense groups, civil rights groups, media groups, student groups. It&rsquo;s a fight which is being forced on Whites, most of whom, I think, would prefer to live in peace with other races  &mdash;  but are not being allowed to do so. Perhaps websites like this one are one of the first steps towards getting organized? </p>

<p>Ok, first, a little humor (good post, BTW):<br>
&#8220;stooper?&#8221; Just playing with you. You used ten- cent words like &#8220;de facto, &#8221; and, hell yoy even tried &#8220;DU Jour.&#8221;<br>
(Thank God I&rsquo;m another ANON, otherwisze yu cud get me fur spelling wurds the way mi mynd wanted to sey them, as upposed tu the wae they are suppozed to be speld).</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned how particularly looney your local Libtards are&hellip;no doubt you can recall speech and proclamations that melt your mind, so absurd as they are.<br>
But, and I guess you might suspect this, my friend: Liberals who &#8220;embrace diversity&#8221; are really all the same. I find them all to be just stark raving psychotic. They may have IQs of 115 to 160&hellip;I know some VERY bright Liberals. Just nothing short of brilliant.<br>
But wise, in the field of race reality? Good God, no. In this sense, their general intelligence has not saved them one whit from appearing totally bonkers. In fact, you know that smart people have very byzantine minds, and many creative levels of self deception, as well as a lot, I mean A LOT of anxiety issues, because they have genes and the upbringing that encourages constant moralizing.<br>
I know, I&rsquo;m fairly bright, and I&rsquo;m AMAZED at how my mind wants to moralize so much. Economical rationalization is so, SO often questioned. It&rsquo;s a trait that hig IQ types haven&rsquo;t weeded out. It has caught us at a very nasty time in Human evolution, whence the dumb and brutal are actually going to cull our numbers (with our help, of course, because they couldn&rsquo;t tie their shoes if we didn&rsquo;t make said shoes, or show the third worlders how to tie them!)<br>
Seriously, the cult of diversity and all that follows it, stamps a Libtard with the same unbelievable propensity for stupidity&hellip;Portland, Miami, New York or Osh Kosh. <br>
They&rsquo;re all fit to be tied!</p>

		<p>For the handfull of racists who disparage Asians: while I am generally pesimistic about diversity, many Asians have better preserved or even advanced positive aspects of western culture that have deteriorated among whites and even more so among  blacks. Their sense of discipline, self control (very low rates of crime, school-drop-outs and out-of-wedlock births) and family are still very strong. South Korea is now the largest producer of Christian missionaries. East Asians are keeping the flame of western classical music alive. And the high rate of intermarriage between Asians and whites is further proof of their largely successful assimilation. The only threat to their assimilation are found in the (mostly white) educational, economic and political elites who have embraced a statist, multicultural dogma. </p>
