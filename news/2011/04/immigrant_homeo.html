<h1>Immigrant Homeowners Key to Revival</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donn Esmonde, Buffalo News, April 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Think of it as a cry from the past, meant to be heard here and now. Mohamed A. Mohamed came here from war-torn Somalia. He spent nearly two decades in Buffalo. He got a master&rsquo;s degree from UB. He worked for the state. He knows our city, and he knows the hopes and dreams of the refugees who are resettling here in droves. In a bizarre twist of fate, Mohamed returned to Somalia last year to become its prime minister. </p>
<p>He is one of countless immigrants who came, put down roots and bettered himself  &mdash;  to the benefit of Buffalo. The Somalis, Iraqis, Burmese, Pakistanis, Nepalese and others who come by the hundreds each year are the silver lining for a city that is emptying out faster than you can say &#8220;Gone to Carolina.&#8221; Doing everything in our power to bring refugees in, and to keep them from leaving for greener (or warmer) pastures, should to my mind be on top of Byron Brown&rsquo;s &#8220;To Do&#8221; list. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He told the Buffalo News in a 2007 interview that the city should turn immigrants into homeowners: Show them how to establish credit, then help them  &mdash;  or lead them to community agencies  &mdash;  to get mortgages for houses in battered neighborhoods that might otherwise fall to the wrecking ball. </p>
<p>{snip} </p>
<p>The city has a glut of cheap, salvageable houses in hurting neighborhoods that, to many refugees, look like the American Dream. Tattered neighborhoods from the East Side to the West Side are teeming with folks walking the streets dressed in a chador, the flowing Muslim dress, or a lungi, the loose-fitting Burmese pant/skirt. The revival of Buffalo, to my mind, involves seeing a lot more of them. Immigrants are the seeds of the city&rsquo;s regeneration. </p>
<p>There are growing Somali and Burmese communities on the West Side. An expanding Muslim enclave is reclaiming one of the East Side&rsquo;s worst neighborhoods  &mdash;  starting schools, fixing houses, bringing back to barren streets the work ethic and values that built Buffalo. Some of the immigrants resettled here from New York City, which was too expensive. </p>
<p>&#8220;The apartment that [costs] $1,500 a month in New York,&#8221; said Abdul, a recent transplant, &#8220;here is $400 for the same thing.&#8221; </p>
<p>The problem is keeping recent arrivals here, given the tough weather and sketchy job market. Some Muslim husbands, I am told, work weekdays driving a cab in New York, and return to their families each weekend with a full wallet. Buying a house deepens their stake in Buffalo. </p>
<p>Molly Short runs Journey&rsquo;s End, one of four local resettlement agencies. It last year funneled nearly 400 immigrants into the city. </p>
<p>&#8220;Homeownership is inexpensive here,&#8221; said Short. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not uncommon for our refugees to [eventually] buy a home. Some buy a double, and get the rental income &hellip; They want to accomplish that American Dream.&#8221; </p>

		<p><b>He worked for the state.  Says it all.  No foreign born individual should be allowed to work for ANY governmental organization, local, state or federal.  Government jobs do not, in general, create wealth.  They may be necessary in many cases but they do not create wealth.  We have been told time and again how immigrants make us more prosperous, how they contribute to the economy.  Well, government workers do not contribute to the economy, regardless of how needed.  And since the US has no where near a labor shortage government jobs should only go to natural born citizens.</b></p>
<p>This is just another example of how we pay to have our country invaded and our culture destroyed.  If they are not on welfare they get government jobs.  Quite frankly I&rsquo;d rather see an American black get a government job than a foreign born person.  Even if it took two blacks to do the job of one foreigner, at least we would be keeping our own citizens off the streets.  In fact I think private employers should be allowed, if not required, to discrimanate on the basis of national origin.  No where in the bible or our founding documents does it say you must sacrafice your own family for your very distant neighbor.</p>

		<p>This is the usual bold-face lying of the White Liberal Greedy Cheating Class. When America was 90 percent White-like it was before the passage of the America destroying 1965 Immigration Reform Act-it  was a relative paradise for the Native Born White Majority. Everyone understands and knows  this obvious fact. </p>
<p>If &#8220;American cities-let&rsquo;s face it, these are nonwhite foriegn occupied cities-are being depopulated,then do the ecologically correct thing and turn these cities back into forests,praires and meadows inhabited by birds,water fowl,racoons,Moose and Elk.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be wonderfull!!!</p>
<p>The person who wrote this news story is making the economic case for 1)reducing the Native Born White American Majority to an ever dwindling violently persecuted racial minority within the borders of America and 2) setting into motion the Tsunami of post-1965 high fertility nonwhite generated  population growth and the massive ecological detruction that will come with unleashing this ecologically destabilizing force&hellip;in other words, this person is making an economic case for massive death and destruction&hellip;.you can&rsquo;t get much more morally depraved than this. </p>
<p>Amazing isn&rsquo;t..the corporate owned Sierra Club makes an environmental case for race-replacing the Native Born White Majority and a corporate owned Newspaper in Buffalo NY-from the French word for beautifull I think-makes the economic case for race-replacing the Native Born White Majority&hellip; I won&rsquo;t consent to my race-replacement for any reason.</p>
<p>Wat Tyler had the  right  idea in 1383&hellip;the revolting Elites-in the spirit of Christopher Lasch(late UB professor of History) are truly revolting.</p>

		<p>It IS true that &#8220;Somalis, Iraqis, Burmese, Pakistanis, Nepalese and others will take over large swaths of America.  But those areas will not be America; they will be Somalia, Iraq, Burma, Pakistan, etc.  These foreign invaiders will not &#8220;save dying American cities.&#8221;  They will simply ethnically clense Americans from their once grand and productive cities, tuning them into yet more Detroits.</p>
<p>The plan of genocide against Whites is progressing nicely.</p>

<p>To the &#8220;benefit&#8221; of Buffalo? Who is this guy trying to fool with that line? The ONLY reason these cities look like a war torn mess is BECAUSE of 3rd world immigrants, including blacks!  Whites leave when they move in and that is when they take over and &#8220;create their own paradise hell&#8221;?  When our cities were WHITE, they were clean, safe and beautiful.</p>

<p>I wonder if Mr. Esmonde (the author) has volunteered to live in his beloved downtown den of liberal diversity, with all the blacks and Muslims, or whether he lives in a mostly all white gated neighborhood?  BTW, Esmonde, evidently a sports reporter turned social commentator, championed his newspaper shutting down &#8220;racist&#8221; commenting on the articles by banning anonymous posts.  Nice example of First Amendment support by a newspaper.   </p>

		<p>Cities and states trying to draw businesses and residents from other cities and states is fine and dandy and is a perfectly normal and healthy form of competition in this country, but that&rsquo;s not what this writer is going on about. His idea of trying to draw specifically non-white migrants to make up for the flight of residents is a lot like the drug addict looking for his next fix because he&rsquo;s suffering withdrawal pains from his last fix  &mdash;  in other words, sheer insanity. When an urban region bleeds huge numbers of residents over a few decades, there are serious underlying problems at work and bringing in more nonwhite residents will only make the problem worse over the long run. Gotta get me another shot of that heroin!</p>

<i>&#8220;Molly Short runs Journey&rsquo;s End, one of four local resettlement agencies. It last year funneled nearly 400 immigrants into the city.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Four agencies bringing in, at the high end, nearly 1600 immigrants a year into a city without jobs and a large pre-existing black community with high rates of systemic unemployment.</p>
<p>Question: Who is paying the bills for all the people who don&rsquo;t have jobs and who aren&rsquo;t running their own successful businesses?</p>
<p>The black community should be up in arms. Why are immigrants getting this special attention while native blacks are left to languish in their own poverty and misery?</p>
<p>Unless these immigrants can bring back great lakes shipping, the railroad industry, and the steel mills, their impact on reviving Buffalo is going to be negligible at best and at worst, an incessant drain on taxpayers. This is nothing more than importing poverty. </p>
<p>No, African and Middle Eastern immigrants aren&rsquo;t going to turn Buffalo around. They are the nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>Liberal &#8216;progressives&rsquo; like Mr. Esmonde live in a world of dreams and not reality.<br>

<p>Not to mention that before 1965 things were looking up for significant segments the black minority. I attended integrated school in two different neighborhoods in Northern cites. Many of the black kids I went to school with were from ordinary working class families. But they had two parents who were married and seemed to be able to get along with other people without recourse to violence.</p>
<p>Of course that was before Wall Street and Washington decided we didn&rsquo;t need our own steel, automobile and consumer electronic industries. And that we didn&rsquo;t need to pause to solve our own existing problems before massively altering the demographic of our own society.</p>

<p>Journey&rsquo;s end is a organization leveraged to receive surplus government monies.  With 2010 budget of 1.7 million,  ten percent of this budget, or $170,000, was received, apparently, from Medicare/Medicaid by billing the code v65.1 for language &#8220;interpretation services&#8221;.  journey&rsquo;s end was able to increase the 2010 income from this government payment by 55% over 2009: &#8220;The Interpreting Department provided approximately 3,000 hours of service with billing that exceeded budgetary projections by 220%.&#8221; and &#8220;Our customers include medical facilities, schools, courts,and various social service and government agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the annual report, NAZAR JABAR and SARAH KLAWINSKI combine to receive $85,000 per year in salary. </p>

Mr. Esmonde lives in an area of Buffalo called &#8220;Elmwood Village&#8221;.</p>
<p>He, and all the other effete &#8220;progressives&#8221; who live there, believe they&rsquo;re living in a multicultural paradise. They aren&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s overwhelmingly white. They have Richmond Ave as a buffer to the Hispanic west side.</p>
<p>I rode through there last week on a warm day. 99% white people walking around. Just to add some &#8216;color&rsquo;, there are a few indigent black men sitting around doing nothing but acting black-crazy. This is what they consider &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. This also helps them feel morally superior because it gives them a public opportunity to display their tolerance. </p>
<p>The area is controlled by the gay mafia. They control the community with an iron fist and fly their banners so everyone knows who controls the territory. It&rsquo;s ok though because it&rsquo;s [white] GAY pride. They make sure businesses have their ubiquitous rainbow stickers on the door to prove their political correctness. It&rsquo;s kind of like a &#8220;Heil Hitler&#8221; thing. It proves their loyalty and submission to the homosexual community.</p>

		<p>This is very similar to what the Vietnamese immigrants did in the Tenderloin, which is one of San Francisco&rsquo;s worst neighborhoods. They cleaned up the area and opened small businesses. The only drawback was that they lived one family in a one bedroom apartment or a studio which is what they could afford. Now, many of these immigrants have moved on to more prosperous areas of San Fransisco or the suburbs.</p>

		<p>Many of the comments above are wrong. Whites did not leave Buffalo because non-white immigrants moved in they left because rich White globalists fired them by sending their factory jobs to China and Mexico. The same can be said for Detroit. Once again the White man is the White man&rsquo;s worst enemy. Isn&rsquo;t capatalism/globalism/communism great?</p>

		<p>The person who wrote this article is a complete moron.  If you bring in refugees from Somalia, etc., and set them up in &#8220;battered neighborhoods&#8221;, those neighborhoods will get a good deal more &#8220;battered&#8221; and turn into dangerous, crime-ridden, third-world slums in short order. Somalian men deal drugs and join gangs when they are not sitting around chewing &#8220;khat&#8221;, an illegal plant that makes them lazy.  Somalian women have a lot of babies and collect welfare.  It is almost beyond belief that Donn Esmonde thinks Somalians are going to cause the cities to regenerate.  Are you sure this column isn&rsquo;t an April Fools joke?     </p>

		<p>As the housing market is going through hard times, they might be trying to sell these homes to refugees because the refugees are less likely to see that the houses are a bad investment than an American would. If the houses would otherwise &#8220;fall to the wrecking ball&#8221;, they&rsquo;re probably in bad neighborhoods and in a poor condition. </p>

		<p>Actually, Buffalo is dying due to free trade, i.e., the lack of revenue tariffs on foreign made products, and the hiking of taxation on domestic manufacturing to make up for the lost tariff revenue.  The city will not revive until tariffs are put back on the table.  Having U.S. taxpayers, via refugee resettlement scams, pay for more third worlders to flood American cities is not a solution.  </p>
<p>Also a problem is the U.S. EEOC, which hammers businesses with crippling lawsuits every time they look at one of these new immigrants or minorities the wrong way  &mdash;  causing U.S. companies to have to move every job they can overseas just to escape this agency.  Increasing the pool of people whom the EEOC raises lawsuits for only aggravates this problem.<br>

		<p>As a Buffalo area native I remember when the city was thriving.There were large Polish, Irish, and Italian neighborhoods. These people maintained their ethnic identity yet were normal Americans. They didn&rsquo;t speak or dress like they were still in the old country. They worked for ALL that they got, and served in the military with pride and honor. Today these third world foreigners want to turn the city into little Somalia or Yemen. Remember the Lackawanna six terrorists? That is the contribution of this crowd. Anybody who believes this garbage from the liberal Mr. Esmonde is delusional.</p>

<p>I am a Native Born White American Patriot. I don&rsquo;t give hoot about the welfare of blacks-or asians,hispanics,musims,hmong,africans and carribeans..any more than they give a hoot about Native Born White Americans. I am very serious about this. The only important question for me is this:&#8221;What&rsquo;s good for Native Born White Americans&#8221;. Get over your White Christian guilt trip. It is complete spirtual poison.</p>
<p>This is the same nonesense that infests numbersusa.com,FAIR and CIS..organizations that won&rsquo;t dare mention the obvious fact that Native Born White Americans are harmed in the greatest amount by post-1965 nonwhite legal immigrants. No one shoud send even  one penny to these organizations. In the long run-which isn&rsquo;t too long anymore-numbersusa,FAIR, and CIS wil do more harm than good&hellip;you have been warned.</p>

		<p>The Buffalo News instituted a new policy Monday for readers making Web site comments on news stories  &mdash;  a change watched closely by newspapers across the nation.</p>
<p>The News now allows online comments on its Web site only from readers who have registered in advance, with their full names and hometowns.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when readers can comment online anonymously.</p>
<p>The new policy followed a steady chorus of complaints  &mdash;  from the public and within the newsroom  &mdash;  about the anonymous comments that often turned offensive, sometimes reaching the depths of racist and homophobic discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had become more and more troubled by the ugliness of some of the comments,&rdquo; Editor Margaret M. Sullivan said Monday. &ldquo;And it wasn&rsquo;t a rarity. It was the norm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Editors of The News realized that online comments about stories dealing with crime, race, gender and sexuality had turned especially nasty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tone it was setting for our Web site and newspaper was the wrong tone,&rdquo; Sullivan added.</p>
<p>The News is one of only a few, if any, daily newspapers to ban anonymous online comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare,&rdquo; said Richard Karpel, executive director of the American Society of News Editors. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the only newspaper, but it&rsquo;s certainly one of the few taking this step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why media watchers and other newspapers will watch what happens here closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a big issue with newspapers, and I think it&rsquo;s a concern to anybody,&rdquo; Karpel said. &ldquo;This is an issue on the front burner of newspapers all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Banning anonymous comments and requiring people to register in</p>
<p>advance with their full names isn&rsquo;t an easy decision to make.</p>
<p>Daily newspapers, while fighting for their long-term survival, are doing almost anything they can to drive readers to their Web sites, to increase the number of &ldquo;page views&rdquo; they can offer to their Web site advertisers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People make comments, then they read other people&rsquo;s comments, and then they make another comment,&rdquo; Karpel explained. &ldquo;That can create multiple page views on a single story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But newspaper editors across the country have bemoaned online discussions that often have headed into the sewer, threatening the credibility of the whole news product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a swamp as part of your Web site, how does this impact how people look at your news content?&rdquo; Karpel asked.</p>
<p>___________</p>
<p>So much for freedom of speech.</p>

		<p>One individual of color doing well is not the same as an entire race of people of color doing well. We all know some person of color who is an achiever. That does not mean every person in his/her race is endowed with the same amount of intellect or desire. When one person of color is in a class of white students, he/she does well. Sometimes it even works with two. The magic number in my 37 years of experience as an educator is that when the number reaches 3, the individuals become a gang. No longer are they achievers, they are thugs.</p>

		<p>Okay, say you got a pie.  You cut it into eight slices. You and your neighbors are all really happy with your own slices of the pie and maybe the kids get together after high school and share a little pie so that the slices get recut but always within the group so the sizes stay roughly the same and life is good because it is a continuum of generations as our folkway.</p>
<p>Suddenly, half your friends up and vanish as they see a tide(al wave) of ethnification coming and &#8216;would really just as soon not, thanks&hellip;&rsquo;.  Crime, social welfare entitlement and other such shenanigans being just the beginning of exogroup invasion and race replacement.</p>
<p>Now you have many more neighbors who are Black or Mediterranean or Asian and whose children you -pray- you will never have one of your own wedded to as suddenly you have to cut the pie into 12 or 16 slices.</p>
<p>Except that it&rsquo;s still the same sized pie.</p>
<p>Which means that everyone&rsquo;s individual slice just got a lot smaller.</p>
<p>Permanently.</p>
<p>This is racial economics as the definition of a shift from generational continuity and happiness to utter misery.  Where you are seeing typically low-IQ, low-skills, people do service jobs rather than innovate technology or produce from a long gone industry, you are also seeing a (GDP) pie that will -never get bigger- as the slices become more racially balkanized.</p>
<p>Short of &#8216;We would really just as soon not, thanks&hellip;&rsquo; miscegenation, this is the future of the U.S. for it&rsquo;s white founder populations.</p>
<p>No more industrious Poles or pretty Czechs or hyper intelligent Afrikaner refugees from beseiged, ex-Communist or black racist white nations for us.  Just an endless erosion of the quality of life we now have.</p>
<p>&#8216;Journeys End&rsquo; indeed.</p>
<p>For whites.  For beauty.  For prosperity.  For our people.</p>

		<p>There is a point that I think most everyone here is missing. This is really a game of race and economics. Native born blacks are and will continue to be wards of the state  in perpetuity through entitlements unless something changes drastically. The libs under LBJ and since have made sure of that to assure a predictable block of voters. A majority of blacks have a low acumen for business, unless it involves immorality, drugs, or some kind of swindle. Asian immigrants without MDs or other professional credentials are steered into fringe retail businesses like convenience stores,liquor stores, or cheap motels in areas where a white man might fear to tread.For some reason inner city blacks seem less likely to molest an Asian than they would a white man in the same situation. These immigrants profit handsomely from the sale of cheap cigars (the filler gets emptied out to make blunts), cheap beer, lottery tickets, and gambling at machines thinly veiled as video arcades. In return economically depressed municipalities profit handsomely from increased tax revenues and Real Estate agents can unload derelict or difficult properties since these same immigrants have learned that in order to live the &#8216;American Dream&rsquo; to its fullest they must also become landlords.    </p>

<p>Do you insist that ALL nonwhite kids are doomed once their numbers exceed 3 per class? Google Monta Vista High School; a school that&rsquo;s 80 percent minority and has the highest test scores in the county and virtually NO disicipline problems. The teacher clamor  to work there more than any &#8220;majority white school&#8221; because their &#8220;students of color&#8221; are so well behaved and motivated.</p>

		<p>Also a problem is the U.S. EEOC, which hammers businesses with crippling lawsuits every time they look at one of these new immigrants or minorities the wrong way &mdash; causing U.S. companies to have to move every job they can overseas just to escape this agency.</p>
<p>I am 69, old enough to have been a young adult when America was working class paradise.  I have always thought that the impetus for employers to move out of the country was affirmative action which in the 1960&rsquo;s applied only to blacks and the environmental laws.</p>
<p>The EEOC and the Justice Department and the various state and even city and county anti White agencies are basically vultures ready to sue out of existence any business that does not tolerate disfunctional criminal blacks ruining the business.</p>
<p>The environmental laws are even worse.  Businesses can always conform to changing environmental codes and satisfy the government inspectors.</p>
<p>The problem with the environmental laws is that businesses can be hit out of the blue with billion dollar ridiculous civil lawsuits by the numerous under and unemployed anti business extortionist attorneys churned out by the law schools.</p>
<p>Why does America have so many underemployed attorneys?  </p>
<p>Because although the EEOC and Justice department make it hard for a White law graduate to get a job as an attorney, law is still one of the few professions that can be started at home with a computer and a printer and posting oneself on findlaw and other websites that get attorneys together with clients.</p>
<p>Law is the last professional job left to Whites as computer programmers, engineers, accountants, Drs, nurses jobs etc have all been given to non White affirmative action females, often foreign and usually with very dubious credentials, licenses and transcripts.</p>

		<p>So Mr. Esmonde is gay and lives in a gay neighborhood?  White male gays are as discriminated against in the job market as hetero White men.  Lesbians, especially if they have communist and hard left affliations have no trouble finding jobs.</p>
<p>White gay men, because the EEOC has banned White men from employment often go into real estate selling and flipping.</p>
<p>I bet that these tattered neighborhoods and non White immigrants are seen as employment for gay White male contractors, construction workers, mortgage brokers, salesmen and buyers hoping to flip the houses to non White immigrants with the help of gay administered federal grants for mortgages for non White immigrants.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t bother to googel Monta Vista High School.  I know the minorities there are not blacks.  Probably a mix of Asians and Indians whose parents are computer programmers and accountants.  By the Way, middle easterners are Whites and counted as Whites.</p>
<p>Are you an Arab or Indian?  You are a White caucasian no matter how dark your skin or foreign your ways.<br>

<p>ha ha.  Years ago the papers could cover up black on White crime, and distort the news according to the latest directives from liberal propaganda central.  Their readers had no way of telling the truth.  Letters to the editors contrary to the latest PC line were discarded.</p>
<p>But when the internet comments were instituted, the papers realized that Whites were not swallowing their propaganda.  So now they want people to register comments that do not adhere to the latest PC directives, probably so the ADL/AJC/SPLC/ACLU/Justice Department can imprison them for hate crime and incorrect thought.</p>
<p>Since papers depend on the comments sections for their advertizing revenues, the best revenge for 70 years of anti White propaganda is just do not make comments at all.</p>
<p>Then see advertizing revenues fall and the papers go out of business.</p>

		<p>The author is either severely mentally ill, or he&rsquo;s (hopefully ) being sarcastic. These &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; are colonists, they have seen the power of the White colonist in other lands, now they want a piece. We can see clearly wherein the problems reside. This author is likely a TV-hypnotized, chemically brainwashed, delusional libtard, but perhaps some part of him is reaching out for the truth that only AmRen provides through these articles and community comments. Let us help him see the truth.</p>
