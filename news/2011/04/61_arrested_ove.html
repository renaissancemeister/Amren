<h1><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2011-04-10-Muslim_veil_France_10_ST_N.htm">61 Arrested Over Banned Paris Muslim Veil Protest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>USA Today, April 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police on Saturday arrested 61 people  &mdash;  including 19 women  &mdash;  for attempting to hold an outlawed Paris protest against France&rsquo;s pending ban on face-covering Islamic veils, a top police official said.</p>
<p>Fifty-nine people were detained while trying to demonstrate at Place de la Nation in eastern Paris, as were two others while traveling there from Britain and Belgium, said Nicolas Lerner, chief of staff for the Paris police chief.</p>
<p>The arrests come amid in a rising, if small, groundswell of controversy over Monday&rsquo;s start of an official ban of garments that hide the face, which includes Muslim veils such as the slit-eyed niqab and the full face-covering burqa. Women who disobey the law risk a fine, special classes and a police record.</p>
<p>The demonstrators rallied in defiance of a ban of the protest ordered Friday by Paris police on the ground that a Muslim group&rsquo;s call for the rally was &#8220;clearly an incitement to violence and racial hatred,&#8221; said Lerner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The protest was called by a group known as Unicite Tawhib, which has been linked to Internet sites that call for Islam to dominate France and the world, Lerner said.</p>
<p>Secular France has been in the throes of a debate about the role of religion in its society. Many Muslims have felt stigmatized by a 2004 law that banned Islamic headscarves in classrooms and during the intense debate that preceded the adoption of the face-veil ban last year.</p>
<p>The measure forbids women to hide their faces in public places, even in the streets. Violators could face a fine of euro150 ($215) or a citizenship course  &mdash;  or both. Anyone found forcing a woman to cover her face risks a year in prison and a euro30,000 fine ($43,000), and possibly twice that if the veiled person is a minor.</p>

That&rsquo;s all?   Why not deportation?   That&rsquo;s the ONLY solution that will do it.</p>

<p>Ooops, I forgot!   Sarkozy doesn&rsquo;t want to lose his precious multicultural minorities. He just wants to look like he&rsquo;s doing something.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all just smoke and mirrors if you don&rsquo;t reverse the demography.  Wise mullahs and &#8216;community leaders&rsquo; will simply tell their Faithful that Allah provides that the infidel is to be defeated, not his followers.</p>
<p>And birth rates will assure this, in 20 years time.</p>
<p>Taqiyah (the art of subterfuge and false promises to gain tactical advantage in a strategic war of religious dominance) is NOT simply about out and out lying to the face of your enemy.</p>
<p>It is about knowing when to back off and be weak.  And when to charge hard and be unyielding.</p>
<p>Giving France what they want will result in a few Muslims going home, &#8216;outraged&rsquo; by the the realization that they are mere guests in a nation they seek to subvert with their vile culturated mannerisms.</p>
<p>But those who stay.  Those who see the French roll over and go back to sleep?  They will will inherit a landscape made islamic by virtue of simple birthrates.  4-6 kids for Islam vs. 1-2 for Westerners = certain cultural suicide.</p>
<p>For the Islamics, who have nothing in their own lands _and know it_, there will be no easy victory as a simple denial of services such as we could use to evict the majority of Hispanics tomorrow.</p>
<p>They will moan and remember, bitterly, their defeat.  But they will cling like ticks and embed themselves yet further with compromise and payoff (Jizya, a tax on non-believers), making their present cooperation an act of played up drama as &#8216;future favors&rsquo;, much like the blacks do slavery.</p>
<p>And the reason they will not leave is because the Middle East is a truly a wasteland of restricted classes, overpopulation, incredible environmental stress and, oh yes, a blood and death from their own.</p>
<p>Comparitively, Europe and The West are wonderlands just shy of paradise.</p>

		<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d be saying America needs to follow the example of France   &mdash;   but there&rsquo;s an exception to every rule, and here it is.  We ALSO need to ban the head rags, veils and burkas that these wretched Muslims bring to show how enslaved their women are - and even though we outlawed slavery in 1865, it&rsquo;s still legal for the Muslim men.  Why is this???  France is right - take it away!!!</p>

		<p>This was just a test to see if the French govt would actually enforce the law or just pass it to try and appease conservative voters.  </p>
<p>I guess they enforced it, but for how long?  Will it be repealed when the first person goes in there and says how their female friend or family member was honor killed because she couldn&rsquo;t wear a veil and blame the govt for the death?  Time will tell.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure.  I would love to see someone ask these Muslims what would happen to their wives or daughters if they went into Saudi Arabia or Pakistan without a veil on and walked around.  The real question would be how long until she is either detained, killed, or raped.  Or all of the above. </p>

		<p>Who would have thought the French (who could never hold back the Germans) would be the strongest Europeans to push back against Muslim invasion?  </p>
<p>Imagine if the US tried to ban the burka.  Muslims wouldn&rsquo;t have to say one word because MSNBC, NY Times, CNN, etc. would say it for them, all the while calling Christian whites who cause no one harm bigots, zealots, and racists.</p>

		<p>They should either: move to Saudi Arabia or they can just go ahead and save the honor of all the muslim women and girls by keeping them inside or by death. If they honor kill them, then that is a few less muslims to worry about; and thanks to &#8220;diversity&#8221; we cannot condemn them for their culture.
