<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republicans on the House Administration Committee want to shore up voter registration rules in the wake of a Colorado study that found as many as 5,000 non-citizens in the state took part in last year&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), the panel&rsquo;s chairman, called the study &#8220;a disturbing wake-up call&#8221; that should cause every state to review its safeguards to prevent illegal voting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We simply cannot have an electoral system that allows thousands of non-citizens to violate the law and vote in our elections. We must do more to protect the integrity of our electoral processes,&#8221; Harper added.</p>
<p>Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler, a Republican, told the panel that his department&rsquo;s study identified nearly 12,000 people who were not citizens but were still registered to vote in Colorado.</p>
<p>Of those non-citizen registered voters, nearly 5,000 took part in the 2010 general election in which Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet narrowly defeated Republican John Buck.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He told Harper that Colorado would look to create a registration system that would allow his department to ask that some people provide proof of their citizenship in writing.</p>
<p>If individuals did not respond to the request, their registration as voters would be suspended.</p>
<p>Rep. Charles Gonzalez (D-Texas) raised doubts about the reporting, noting that the study itself said it was based on inconclusive data and that it was &#8220;impossible to provide precise numbers&#8221; on how many people who were registered to vote in the state were not citizens.</p>

		<p>If you believe it&rsquo;s just 5,000 in just one state, then I have a mountain range I want to sell you.  In November 2000, somewhere between 2 and 3 million illegal aliens nationwide voted.</p>
<p>And why wouldn&rsquo;t they?   There&rsquo;s nobody stopping them, and no consequence in their doing so.  First off, the canvassing boards in a lot of counties are run by big time libs, so they&rsquo;re not going to tell Jose the illegal alien from Mexico no when he comes to register to vote.  Second, motor-voter practically begs the registration of illegal aliens on the voter rolls.  Third, the U.S. Attorneys could prosecute illegal aliens that vote, but all the U.S. Attorneys work for Republocratic open borders Presidents, so they won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>This is exactly the ammunition they need in TEXAS to counter the argument that voting by illegal aliens is a myth. Ask Bob Dornan if it is a myth. Better still, ask Loretta Sanchez.</p>

		<p>Who holds out hope for this stunt by the GOP pols?</p>
<p>Next the howls of &#8220;racism&#8221; will start, and then the backpedaling will start, then the bill will just sort of disappear, because &#8220;we can&rsquo;t be distracted from the business of America right now, which is the economy, jobs, and debt; we must make some concessions to move us forward&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>All the usual voodoo.  If we had hope, we&rsquo;d have some substance upon which to base it.  The Tea Party is all puff.  They&rsquo;ll embrace &#8220;differences&#8221; faster than anyone, because they simply can&rsquo;t withstand charges of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Have hope only when you hear a pol say, &#8220;If you define patriotism and defense of America from enemies as &#8216;racism,&rsquo; then let me stand up an proudly proclaim myself a racist and invite all American patriots to join me in challenging our detractors and enemies to proclaim the U.S. Constitution as the law of the land, or is it also racist?&#8221;<br>

		<p>Not mentioned in the article was the fact that, that Ken Buck, the Republican candidate for Senate, lost by 2,000 votes.  That gives the Dems just one more illegal Senate vote.</p>

<p>Look at the letter next to his state.  Of course he is going to throw out this study, it would hurt his chances of getting re-elected.  </p>
<p>And 5,000?  Maybe per county with a population of 1 million+.  No science behind this folks, but I&rsquo;d guess voter fraud is over 100,000 between felons, illegals, and &#8220;dead&#8221; people voting.</p>

		<p>2-Memphomaniac&hellip;exactly.  But Dornan was always an open borders guy.  He really disliked Pat Buchanan, who would always talk about illegal (AND LEGAL immigration).  But he started complaining after the defeat to the Mexican candidate.  Dornan deserved to lose.  Soon it will be very hard for a Republican to get elected President.  </p>

Of course this la raza disciple would dismiss any study implicating his illegal invading hordes of any wrong doing. The fact of the matter is we don&rsquo;t need to know &ldquo;how many&rdquo; illegal invaders voted. If even one illegal invader cast a vote, then it undermines and negates the vote of an American citizen, thereby tainting the entire political process.</p>
<p>While those like Charles Gonzalez will use the &#8220;we don&rsquo;t know how many&rdquo; argument to dismiss any legislation to deal with this issue, the fact is it&rsquo;s not of matter of &#8220;how many,&#8221; but rather attempting to preserve the legitimacy of our democratic process.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the word that obummer and his cronies like to use? Ah yes&hellip;transparency, I believe it is. All of this needs to be moved forward in the name of &ldquo;transparency!&rdquo;<br>

		<p>The issue here isn&rsquo;t voting by illegal aliens, but voting by <i>any</i> aliens, of any status, which has been illegal in every state since 1926. You don&rsquo;t vote until you&rsquo;re sworn in, period.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, though, in the late 19th century many states <i>did</i> allow legal aliens to vote, if they had been living in the state six months and had applied for citizenship. These were generally newer, still-sparsely-populated states in the interior which were seeking high-quality immigrant settlers from Northern Europe, who they though would be attracted to a state offering an early civic amenity.</p>
<p>That was then, this is now&hellip; </p>

		<p>This milquetoast response from the GOP, that this is a disturbing wake up call, is proof that this empire is already in ruins. Let me get it straight&hellip; 5,000 aliens voting in Colorado alone, and there&rsquo;s not Law enforcement, FBI, swarming all over the place, and long lines at prisons and deportation processing centers? </p>
<p>And we hear of a Mexican opposition politician moaning the party line that since they vote 100% Democrat, there is not enough proof?</p>
<p>And we suffer him to speak? We do not call for his immediate impeachment and look into treason charges?</p>
<p>This is not a country.</p>

		<p>I wonder what would happen if all the white folks in america jumped the border illegally into mexico, then started voting white candidates into local and national office. With all the mexican aliens here, how many can there still be in mexico?</p>

		<p>Tens of thousands perhaps more illegals voted last November thanks to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Calipornia. After that decision all they had to show was proof (utility bill, rent receipt and the like) that they were residing in the polling district they were trying to registering in. They then were allowed to register and vote. Sad day for Amrerica when this administration took over.</p>

		<p>This was the easily-predictable effect of the &#8220;motor voter&#8221; law, where the DMV must register anyone who wants it to vote, in addition to registering their vehicles.</p>
<p>I think this was deliberate, and not an &#8220;unintended consequence.&#8221;</p>
