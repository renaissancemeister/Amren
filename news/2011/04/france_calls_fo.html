<h1>France Calls for Pushing Migrants at Sea Back to Tunisia</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monster and Critics News, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Boats from the European Union&rsquo;s border patrol mission Frontex should send migrants found at sea straight back to Tunisia, rather than take them to Italy for identification, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon suggested on Thursday.</p>
<p>Italy has faced an influx of nearly 23,000 Tunisians since mid- January, when an autocratic regime in that country was toppled by popular protests. Most of them landed in Lampedusa, a tiny island straining under the pressure.</p>
<p>&#8216;To avoid those situations that lead Frontex vessels to salvage clandestines at sea and take them to Lampedusa, it would be more intelligent to take them directly to Tunisia,&rsquo; Fillon said after talks in Brussels with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.</p>
<p>Fillon&rsquo;s proposal could prove controversial, as the internationally recognized non-refoulement principle states that authorities cannot push back migrants without checking first for the presence of asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>Barroso did not comment upon Fillon&rsquo;s idea, but said he told Tunisian authorities during a visit on Tuesday that it was in their interest to help control migration to avoid such a &#8216;sensitive&rsquo; issue being hijacked by &#8216;certain populist, extremist forces&rsquo; in EU countries.</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s Front National and Italy&rsquo;s Northern League are among the right-wing parties wooing voters with tough anti-immigration slogans.</p>
<p>In February, Frontex launched a patrol mission in the Mediterranean to curb migratory flows towards Italy and Malta. Last week the French Interior Minister agreed with his Italian counterpart that France would contribute to the exercise.</p>
<p>The deal came amid tensions between the two countries over Italy&rsquo;s decision to grant temporary residence permits to North African migrants, in a bid to ease the pressure on its administration by allowing them to travel within the EU&rsquo;s border-free Schengen area.</p>
<p>Fillon reiterated his country&rsquo;s criticism of that policy.</p>
<p>&#8216;First of all, the rules must be applied, there is no rule that says that clandestine economic migrants should be welcomed and should move freely across the European territory,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Therefore, a large part of the Tunisians citizens that have arrived in Italy should not, as some people suggest, be shared out among European countries, they should be sent back to their country,&rsquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>Italy has also asked  &mdash;  in vain  &mdash;  for the activation of an EU emergency mechanism to reallocate to other EU countries the small proportion of North African migrants who are in need of international protection, and thus have a right to stay in the bloc.</p>
<p>But Fillon indicated that France was already doing its part, claiming that it was processing 50,000 asylum requests per year compared to Italy&rsquo;s 10,000.</p>
<p>&#8216;Everybody should keep in mind these figures,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>According to the EU&rsquo;s statistical agency, Eurostat, France in 2010 received 51,595 asylum applications, but granted international protection only to 5,115.</p>
<p>In the same year, Italy received 10,050 requests, and approved 4,305.</p>

		<p>These Africans&hellip;like all the rest before them&hellip;.have one reason and one reason only for trying to get into Europe:  They want a better standard of living and the freebies they know they will get from the ruling class fools in every country.</p>
<p>And after they get established they&rsquo;ll get on web sites like this one and crow about how superior their people and country are compared to whites and white nations.</p>
<p>They might be ingrates, but, believe me, they&rsquo;re stupid first.<br>
But not as dumb as the ruling elitist fools.</p>

		<p>Forget the EU.  Barrosso is firmly committed to welcoming mass immigration into Europe.</p>
<p>Blocking mass invasion is a military problem for the NATO alliance. NATO should be given a clear mandate to blockade the smuggling ships, returning their human cargo to point of origin and scuttling their vessels. </p>
<p>This should be fought like a war.</p>

		<p>Apparently the world is simply NOT getting it. WHY are all these wretched asylum seekers young, military age muslim MEN! WHERE are the &#8220;poor&#8221; children and women? What is happening is that the EU is letting in more &#8220;youth&#8221; who are going to be the looters, robbers, rapists and arsonists in their country this summer and their numbers now are such that no country can get rid of them without facing the true fact that only violence and bloodshed is going to come of this.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Forgive me, but I don&rsquo;t understand!  Tunisians had their wonderful democratic revolution, toppling that wicked &#8220;autocratic regime&#8221;. So now they should be celebrating, no?  Why, therefore, are they  fleeing by the tens of thousands and heading for (of course!) Europe?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s earthquake, flood, famine, or revolution, the answer is always to head for Europe.  Every excuse under the sun provides another opportunity to flee  as &#8220;refugees&#8221; to Europe, where the livin&rsquo; is easy and the welfare is generous.</p>

		<p>The flood of invaders form Africa is not only a result of the misery of the „Dark Continent&ldquo; but also results out of decadence of the ruling privileged class of Europe for their greed for cheap labor and new wage slaves to replace aging populations. Without the conniving of the European political and economic elite conspiring to allow entry of the millions of African migrants there would be no invasion possible.</p>
<p>Looking at the typical European city of today we view a diverse mass of ethnic groups slowly but surely pushing out the remaining original inhabitants much like what occurred in the major US cities in the past century with the influx of millions of Blacks and sadly with a similar regretful result. <br>
Soon Europe will not be European.<br>

<p>Even if these stats are truthful which I doubt, these small numbers along with their high birth rates accumulate over time.  Italy went from having almost no immigrants a short time ago to them making up about 5 percent of the population and half of them are non-Europeans.  France went from a tiny number of Arabs and blacks 30 years ago to it being around six million today.  Of course many of those not approved for asylum stay in the country illegally anyhow.</p>

<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Then again, we might ask why so many sub-Saharan Africans are fleeing from their liberated, post-colonial, majority rule countries? </p>
<p>If being ruled by whites is so terrible, why then do third worlders make such a fetish of moving into white ruled countries in Europe and North America?</p>

		<p>Asylum is the biggest fraud ever.  Asylum should be for when rebels come into your village with guns and torches and it is literally flee for your life.  How many of these migrants faced certain death unless they got on a boat and put Europe in their sights?</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>If the West is the let these people land in their countries, we should send them to countries that are more similar to their culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just white countries, its liberal, weak countries.</p>
<p>How many migrants will Russia take?  The EU would not even dare ask, like they wouldn&rsquo;t to Japan or China.</p>
<p>Third world migrants are locust hoards, moving from resource to resource, until they are all consumed.  Then they leave looking for more.  Give them all a million dollars, a big house, and unlimited education.  It will only last a generation (if that) without white intervention.</p>

<p>As of Sunday night:</p>
<p>ROME – A train carrying Tunisian immigrants from Italy was halted at the French border Sunday in an escalation of an international dispute over the fate of North African migrants fleeing political unrest for refuge in Europe.</p>
<p>Italy has been giving temporary residence permits to many of the roughly 26,000 Tunisians who have gone to Italy to escape unrest in northern Africa .  France says it will honor the permits only if the migrants prove they can financially support themselves, and it has instituted patrols on the Italian border  &mdash;  unprecedented since the introduction of the Schengen travel-free zone  &mdash;  bringing in about 80 riot police last week. Germany has said it would do the same.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Italian rail company told The Associated Press in Rome that the train carrying migrants  <b>and political activists who support them </b> wasn&rsquo;t allowed to pass into  France, from the border station of Ventimiglia on Sunday.</p>

<p>(Do note  that  - just as here - these invaders are always accompanied and advised  by enablers from within our own ranks! As the USA has seen for many years, we provide our own worst enemies.)<br>

		<p>France Stops All Italian Trains Carrying North African Immigrants </p>
<p>The Telegraph ^ | 4/17/2011 | Peter Allen, Paris </p>
<p><br>
In dramatic scenes in Menton, in south east France, border guards including riot police halted hundreds of mainly North African men who have crossed from Libya and Tunisia. </p>
<p>The trains, on which they travelled and which also contained political activists calling for better rights for immigrants, were attempting to cross from the nearby Italian border station of Ventimiglia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Italy infuriated the French last week by giving out temporary residence visas</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;Our orders are to cancel all services from Italy,&#8221; said a spokesman for the French national train operator SNCF. </p>
<p>He said the trains had been stopped on the orders of the Alpes-Maritimes Prefecture &#8220;until further notice&#8221;. </p>
<p>The Italian Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, directed his embassy in Paris to lodge a protest with France. </p>
<p>Mr Frattini said Rome wanted &#8220;clarifications on measures taken (by Paris) which appear to be illegal and in clear violation of European principles&#8221;. </p>
<p>It was the latest chapter in a bitter diplomatic dispute caused by the arrival of thousands of immigrants in Italy from Arab countries like Tunisia and Libya which have undergone revolutions this year. </p>
<p>Italy infuriated the French last week by giving out temporary residence visas, allowing the immigrants to travel in the European Union. </p>
<p>Many want to go to France because they speak French, and because they believe that President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s approach to the war in Libya means he will be sympathetic to them. </p>
<p>But the French government insists it will only allow in those with the financial resources to live in France independently – a requirement which rules out most of those who have fled to Europe. </p>
<p>Security has been stepped up right across the Franco-Italian border, including along ancient foot paths linking the two countries. </p>
<p>Italian officials have confirmed that thousands of immigrants have been arrested</p>

<p>We are beyond that tipping point right now. Why can&rsquo;t most White Americans SEE it?  We are now the Silent MINORITY in our own land.</p>
<p>This is a FACT and we only have to look among us to see it in plain view. In the good ole USA we now have 50% (if even that) of taxpayers supporting the other 50% who do NOT pay taxes. All I see are those 50% having baby after baby, all on our dime, committing most of the crimes, in the gangs, and most are from these immigrant groups of the last 50 years.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>I have to disagree with you on that. Although I partially agree with you as well.  It&rsquo;s a very difficult,  problematic question.  Your solution is scary and it could only work in a ruthless, totalitarian society.  In the past, Nature took care of that problem automatically when the improvident and the dull witted simply starved. Now, through our generous social welfare programs we both feed them and breed them. This, of course, is self-destructive madness in the long term, if we only thought it out, because  we are destroying the future of our own progeny for the sake of others.</p>
<p>The fact is that many to most  jobs are mind-numbing drudgery, requiring no special intelligence.  A genius would go nuts cleaning streets or wrapping Big Macs day in and day out. You don&rsquo;t need a genius at every post. Just enough intelligence to get the job done.</p>
<p>But the really frightening aspect to your proposal is WHO WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING THESE DECISIONS?  Some philopher-king?  Some infallible god?  Some all-wise committee?  Probably not! What if that person or committee decided that  &#8220;racists&#8221; and whites and  people like YOU should not be allowed to breed? Given the way things are in this real world, that would be much more likely.  I would not want to entrust such awesome power to any fallible mortal.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, it would be perfect. But what you are proposing is to open an extremely dangerous can of worms that could very easily backfire ON YOU.  </p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know the solution. It would take a team of super experts to do an extensive study (completely impartial and free of political/religious/ideological influence) to  figure it out. I&rsquo;d still be leery of their solution, since most academics and &#8220;experts&#8221; today are far to the left. I think we need to get back closer to Mother Nature and Thomas Malthus, but tempered by a civilized compassion, coupled with firmness and &#8220;tough love&#8221; for those who just can&rsquo;t make it on their own&hellip; (i.e. you&rsquo;ll get your food stamps if you get your tubes tied).</p>

Sadly, that is much more likedly to be the way it goes.  You&rsquo;rte opening a can of worms there which could badly backfire.</p>

		<p>Right wing Berlusconi knows what he&rsquo;s doing by giving those migrants travel permits to go to France.  He&rsquo;s trying to unravel the European Union treaty and increase nationalism across Europe.  I used to think the EU was a good deal and it still is economically but politically it is just another step towards one world government.  Flush it!  </p>

		<p>It is hoped that all intelligent people would read Raspail&rsquo;s Camp of the Saints to get a good synopsis of this current scenario..the French are correct; send them back without &#8220;Landfall.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Again I would ask, WHY are all these &#8220;refugees&#8221; only military age young African muslim MEN!! WHERE are the women and children as one sees in any refugee column in WWII? NOPE! only invading muslim men who are going to be burning cars, praying in and blocking streets, murdering, robbing and raping (mostly White non muslim european women) wherever they land and establish a beach head for other muslim men to come ashore on. </p>
