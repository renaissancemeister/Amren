<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Â£120-a-time Gmatch service uses saliva samples to test whether potential partners are compatible and claims a better success rate than any other matchmaking website.</p>
<p>Founder Sarah A. Port, 25, said: &#8220;When we meet someone for the first time, we know within seconds whether we&rsquo;re attracted to them or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without realising it, the first thing we do when we meet someone is sniff them. It&rsquo;s all to do with the chemicals  &mdash;  or pheromones  &mdash;  that we give off,&#8221; she added.<br>

						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Switzerland-based company [GenePartner] says they can use a $199 DNA test (compare to $1,000 for 23andMe) to help you find your perfect match, statistically speaking. They&rsquo;ve analyzed &#8220;hundreds of couples&#8221; and have determined the genetic patterns found in successful relationships. Based on their algorithm and your DNA, they&rsquo;ll determine the probability for a satisfying and long-lasting relationship between two people (color me skeptical).</p>
<p>What about romance? Chemistry? That certain je ne sais quoi when you meet someone and get a tingling sensation in your stomach? Forget it. The future of dating is DNA tests and buccal swabs, so get used to it:</p>
<p>A brush for collecting your DNA sample from your saliva  &mdash;  called a buccal swab kit  &mdash;  will be sent to your address. {snip}</p>
<p>GenePartner is looking to partner with dating sites and have those services encourage users to see if they&rsquo;re a DNA match.</p>
<p>Will they be able to avoid tough emerging U.S. laws around genetic testing? Well, they&rsquo;re in Switzerland. {snip}<br>

<p>This is one step away from Big Brother assigning life partners via DNA testing.  The government will assign who can mate with whom, so get used to it.</p>
<p>Whites will not be matched with whites, but with non-whites&hellip; one more arrow in the government&rsquo;s quiver to eliminate white DNA once and for all.  </p>

<p>I think we may need to retrain those conspiracy theories. I think it is very interesting that they can associate people based upon DNA.</p>
<p>If race exist like we believe, the relationship between DNA and dating may prove invaluable.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>

Dating through artificial intelligence and DNA samples is, from an American point of view, unconstitutional.</p>
<p>White bachelors who cannot find a spouse in their area should roam.<br>
Even if finding a companion takes them outside of their state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a price men must pay for living in the global age.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing if this goes along with a &#8216;questionnaire&rsquo; type survey (Are you rich, are you pretty, what do you do for a living?) as meeting SES expectations or if it&rsquo;s &#8216;purely genes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The fact is that women and men are both more physically selective of partners than we are comfortable admitting, typically preferentially choosing &#8216;familiar but not too familiar&rsquo; shapes and colors and classes over the Hollyweird image of the &#8216;Bad Boy&rsquo; (or the Ethnic).  Once this basic choice has been made, we then focus more narrowly on success factors deriving from it.</p>
<p>And from this factor alone we have _statistically_ discovered it is possible to determine an individual&rsquo;s attraction index to a given stranger based on whether or not they are &#8216;genetically&rsquo; blonde vs. brunette or short vs. tall etc.</p>
<p>But so does a photograph and a copy of your bankstatement while a stamp only costs 50 cents.</p>
<p>The sad fact being that these statistical population studies ALL indicate that certain classes of people _just do better_.</p>
<p>If you are smart, you are typically bigger and more beautiful in the generalized homogenic sense, if you are tall, you get a natural boost in ego/submission driven career opportunities.  If you are &#8216;well adjusted&rsquo; as SES advantaged from these factors, you will live longer and have a healthier, more productive old age, (which aids your children&rsquo;s advancement) due to lower stress.</p>
<p>They have known this since the initial 1921 studies of &#8216;Terman&rsquo;s Termites&rsquo; which refuted the previously held notion that brillliant children were socially unstable and &#8216;freakish&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of the 1500 (highly gifted) Termites who were handpicked by a pair of California teachers operating on a 34,300 dollar grant, not all did exceptionally, but nearly all had stable and productive lives.  Importantly, he discovered the obvious: that if you didn&rsquo;t teach your children to succeed, they &#8216;sub maximized&rsquo; their behavior as performance to levels of other children&rsquo;s and general social expecations.  THIS being the basis of depression and sociopathy.</p>
<p>_It is in the genes_.  And IQ leads the way as an indicator of overall quality in other, physical and social acceptance areas.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think we yet have the (public) knowledge to say which ones, on a long-sequence basis.</p>
<p>As for pheromones and sniffing, while the skin does produce pheromones with sweat, the human pheromone receptor (that little opening on the inside rim of your nose) is no longer active in 98% of the population.</p>
<p>So if someone is sniffing you, it&rsquo;s because you smell bad and that is a _social_ indicator of low self esteem and poor social achievement index.</p>
<p>If you were smart, you would consider personal hygiene to be automatic and second nature and they would be judging you on other areas.</p>
