			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathon M. Seidl, The Blaze, April 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The New Black Panther Party, the racist and radical black power group, has a big day ahead of it this coming Saturday. According to its website, it&rsquo;s planning a massive 60-city &#8220;showdown.&#8221; And the day of rage will include a protest of &#8220;non-black&#8221; businesses.</p>
<p>The group says it&rsquo;s establishing a home base at an office building in Harlem, an area it&rsquo;s modeling after revolutionary ground zero in Egypt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The site goes on to explain why its rallying:<blockquote>As in other revolutions, protests and uprisings going on around the earth, a showdown is looming for Saturday April 23rd as marchers with the &#8220;National International Day of Action and Unity&#8221; are furious and frustrated with New York officials blatant discrimination and denial of their constitutional and human right to rally and march. Marchers are marching and rallying in 60 cities around America and in London and Africa to demand justice for Black People and improvement in our conditions.<br>
</blockquote>But &#8220;rally&#8221; might not be the best term for it. The group, rather, uses other words including &#8220;confrontation,&#8221; and says the protesters will use &#8220;whatever action is necessary to relieve oppressive conditions against Blacks in New York and around the planet.&#8221; And apparently the law doesn&rsquo;t matter: it will hold the event &#8220;with or without a permit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those groups &#8220;actions&#8221; apparently include protests against whites. As part of the massive march on Saturday, the NBPP has also called on blacks to boycotts white businesses for the entire weekend:</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t have organized this event better for our AmRen White Community&rsquo;s consciousness raising service efforts.

		<p>The ADL has come out against these events, apparently because the NBPP is using anti-Semitic language in their promotional material.  All I can say is that the ADL made this bed; You really hope nobody has to sleep in that kind of bed, but by the same token, I won&rsquo;t be losing sleep in my own bed if they wind up having to.</p>

<p>Maybe our NBPP-loving Attorney General can stop by and lend his support.

<p>I truly wish that I had something positive to say about blacks, but in all sincerity, it would be immoral and illogical to do so.</p>

		<p>By boycotting White businesses, one could only hope that they stay out of the restaurants and stores. Then maybe the patrons will feel safe and not have to always be looking over their shoulders whenever large groups of &#8220;youths&#8221; are around. Somehow though, I doubt it&rsquo;ll be that easy. They will want to attack some Whites who were a serious threat to them by (oh, the horror) ignoring them! Blacks don&rsquo;t like to be ignored.</p>

		<p>Do blacks realize that if the govt. fails they will not get anymore welfare?  I swear they do not know the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>Let the NBPP riot, I&rsquo;m sorry, &#8220;protest&#8221;.  they want their own country in the U.S., give them a state and make all blacks move there.  I&rsquo;d be willing to be a U.S. of 49 states with zero blacks.  I don&rsquo;t even think THEY know why they are protesting.  They just picked the &#8220;Egypt&#8221; fad and want to cause havoc.</p>
<p>&#8220;the NBPP has also called on blacks to boycotts white businesses for the entire weekend&#8221;</p>
<p>And on Monday all white business owners will be shocked at their inventory levels when they realize how much less was stolen that weekend from them.  I hope they boycott white businesses forever.</p>

<p>Geithner&rsquo;s support of replacing the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency makes no sense unless the goal is to create system failure. No logical nation would willingly give up this privilege. Without the ability to print wealth, the Western welfare state will collapse, and it will not take decades.</p>
<p>I suspect that the black race is again being used, this time as a scapegoat. Watch for more race-realistic stories highlighting blacks to be broadcast on the networks.<br>

		<p>All of this evil hatred boils down to the simple fact that blacks can&rsquo;t compete equally in a first world society no matter how hard they try, and it enrages them to no end.  They absolutely love to believe it is whites&rsquo; fault, not their own.  Their collective pretense of injustices by whites acts as a kind of soothing salve to cover their wounded pride.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more than eager to grasp the excuses offered to them by the likes of Rev. Wright and the many others like him, telling them they can&rsquo;t succeed, because of whites, never EVER admitting to themselves that they just don&rsquo;t have the intelligence or ability to compete in a first world society.</p>
<p>Many mestizos are at the average black I.Q. level, but they have the abilities that blacks lack:  A good work ethic, creativity, and the necessary impetus and drive to form their own businesses.</p>
<p>Blacks will NEVER be able to compete in a first world nation, and they would be far better off moving to their homelands in Africa where they can steal, kill, rob and loaf with their own peers.  At least they wouldn&rsquo;t be consumed with all the hatred they have for whites, because they can&rsquo;t compete against them.  Too, if they were honest with themselves, they would admit they can&rsquo;t really compete with ANY OTHER race either, which is another vital reason they should seriously consider relocation.</p>

		<p>I am very much in favor of their &#8220;Day of Rage&#8221; and boycott. Unlike the lefties who wish to shut down anyone who wishes to say something they don&rsquo;t agree with, I instead welcome it. These folks will be exposed for what they are.</p>
<p>I checked out the seven minute video the NBPP put out for this event, found in a link in the original article. It is, as expected, rather incoherent, but contains a part toward the end that I found hysterical: someone speaking in an Alvin from the Chipmunks voice about the Black man&rsquo;s plight.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Saturday April 23rd&#8221;, don&rsquo;t they mean EASTER SATURDAY? I don&rsquo;t like Christianity, and I don&rsquo;t even like Amren&rsquo;s ban on criticising Christianity, but isn&rsquo;t the media not even mentioning Easter getting kind of ridiculous? When the media despises western culture so much that they pretend the West&rsquo;s major cultural festivals don&rsquo;t exist, then you know there&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>And the nerve of Black people attacking white people, who bend over backwards for them, on Easter is just outrageous.</p>
<p>This NBPP terrorist organisation that the justice department loves needs to be banned and closed down. But I expect they will be showered with praise for their &#8220;heroic&#8221; resistance to &#8220;oppression&#8221;.</p>

		<p><i>The New Black Panther Party is planning a massive 60-city &ldquo;showdown.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s finally arrived!  </p>
<p>The revolt of the Useful Idiots and Running Dogs!</p>
<p>Looks like all those promises <b>Fearless Leader</b> made to blacks (mostly to punish Whitey) were nothing but LIES.</p>
<p>Easily led-by-the-nose blacks do not protest, they riot; if there is enough agitation or someone eggs them on, one small spark will turn this into a full-on burn, loot and destroy free-for-all.   Once the first White store window is broken, the furies will be released, and it will be violent.  Imagine raging urban blacks released upon the cities.</p>
<p>Once the rioting and looting start, it will be hard to stop.  The only solution will be to <i>Release the Kraken!!</i> to restore order; that is, if the wimpy leader of the po-pos and spineless city mayors have the guts. Black leaders will surely come forth and call it a &#8220;Rebellion&#8221; as did Maxine Waters during the LA riots, while screaming &#8220;No Justice, No Peace!&#8221;</p>
<p>If other non-Whites get wind of free loot to be had, they&rsquo;ll join in the fun. The majority of rioters in LA during the Rodney King riots were hispanics, not blacks, and I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t know one whit about what the riots were about   &mdash;   only that local stores had been broken into and were open, the LAPD were told to stand down and if they didn&rsquo;t hurry, all the good stuff   &mdash;   booze, pharmaceutical drugs and potato chips   &mdash;   would be gone.</p>
<p>And from #9 BO_Bill </p>
<p><i>Geithner&rsquo;s support of replacing the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency makes no sense unless the goal is to create system failure. Without the ability to print wealth, the Western welfare state will collapse, and it will not take decades.</i></p>
<p>I believe the ultimate goal WAS to create system failure.</p>
<p>Remember:  We are all Keynesians now!   (stated by Richard Nixon in 1971).</p>
<p>Well, the Keynesian chickens are coming home to roost!</p>
<p>Keynes himself wrote in <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace:</i></p>
<p><i>By continuing a process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.  There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of a society than to debauch its currency.</i></p>
<p>The entire government-co-opted economic system could meltdown overnight leading to food riots, as a result of the loss of the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency.</p>
<p>Here are The Deadly Signs on the Road to Hyperinflation: (from the <i>McAlvany Intelligence Advisor</i>)</p>
<p>1.  Moral Erosion resulting from a national prioritization of greed and pleasure.</p>
<p>2.  Creation of a fiat currency system</p>
<p>3.  Price distortion resulting from easy credit.</p>
<p>4.  Bursting of the credit bubble</p>
<p>5.  Sharp reduction of credit</p>
<p>6.   Short-term deflation of certain high-ticket asset prices</p>
<p>7.  Hasty printing of money out of thin air</p>
<p>8.  The rapid acceleration of cash through the marketplace.</p>
<p><i>I suspect that the black race is again being used, this time as a scapegoat. Watch for more race-realistic stories highlighting blacks to be broadcast on the networks.</i></p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s already happening as blacks are becoming increasingly aware that they&rsquo;ve been duped by their Fearless Leader, are expendable and have been &#8220;thrown under the bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer group&hellip;</p>

<p>Good call.  But you see, despite an awful lot of naysayers, the plan is world government.  It is the reason behind multiculturalism/diversity (Article 12, 16), NAFTA and similar programs, the redistribution of wealth (Article 10), the INTENTIONAL bankrupting of Western countries.  Check out the Earth Charter.  Look at this document not as a benevolent instrument for all mankind but as a &#8220;one world government&#8221; instrument to control us all!

<p>I certainly agree.  Their collective ego - a big one - will never accept that it is THEY who cause their own problems.  However, with the media endlessly promoting miscegenation, at some point in the future, they may appropriate all of our genes, and we will be the ones genocided, and they will be the ones uplifted.  Mix 1 gallon of water at 100 degrees Celsius and 1 gallon of water at 0 degrees Celsius and you wind up with 2 gallons of water at 50 degrees.  We&rsquo;ve got to stop this media conditioning to save our race.</p>

		<p>Dear Folks:</p>
<p>     Just as my first real job was being a car hop at a Mexican restaurant where my bosses&rsquo; whole family only ate, my first guitar licks came from the Ink Spots from records that I bought at race record stores that mostly catered to black people. I&rsquo;m a Central European descended so-called white person but I don&rsquo;t look at it that way. That is a matter of my personal choice and I don&rsquo;t insist it is the only right choice.</p>
<p>     In the 1950&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s relatives lived on Chicago&rsquo;s south side and everyone shopped at the German stores because they were German. In the 1970&rsquo;s I lived in the South where people shopped at the merchants of their own race for the most part. I lived in Hollywood in the 1980&rsquo;s and visited Beverly Hills where the Jewish people supported mostly Jewish merchants, doctors, etcetera.</p>
<p>     So, I don&rsquo;t understand what the big deal is about black business people encouraging other black people to participate in their first Amendment Bill of Rights capitalistic privilege of shopping where they please. Now, if we can only get the left wing misguided liberals and the right wing Rothschild Bank Single World Government New World Order lap puppies to agree that the same constitutional guarantee applies to what critics often call ObamaCare and FOREIGN AID, which in my opinion are both racially motivated, maybe we can get back on track as a constitutional republic.<br>

		<p> &#8220;they would be far better off moving to their homelands in Africa where they can steal, kill, rob and loaf with their own peers. At least they wouldn&rsquo;t be consumed with all the hatred they have for whites, because they can&rsquo;t compete against them. Too, if they were honest with themselves, they would admit they can&rsquo;t really compete with ANY OTHER race either, which is another vital reason they should seriously consider relocation.&#8221;<br>

<p><br>
Absolutely not!  That is precisely why they should NOT move back to Africa, where they would be stabbing, hacking, and burning each other to death.  Do blacks want to live a mong other blacks even right here?  No!  Not if they can help it.  They like YOUR nice communities, and all your nice benefits much better.  </p>
<p>Low IQ or not,  even a cockroach knows where its food  comes from. Despite all the grumbling, blacks know they are always far better off in white societies.  (The complaining is just to get you to cough up more.)   That&rsquo;s why millions of them are clamboring to get into Europe.   Why would they want to move back to Africa and be among their own kind,  where they won&rsquo;t have YOU to mooch off?</p>
<p>Hey, they ain&rsquo;t THAT stupid!</p>

		<p>8  &mdash;  Seneca the Younger, I belive that you have the right idea.  That was what was planned for South Africa, it was called separate development the purpose eing to ensure that the white Africans did not end up as they had already in the rest of africa, dispossessed of their lands and achievements. It was called Apartheid but much of the rest of the World including India (see the movie Slumdog Millionaire to see what they allow)said no, and we see the result now.</p>
<p>Give two or three States to the blacks who must all then move to them.  They have campaigned for this.  Cut down on your welfare bills and keep most of the violent crime in those areas.</p>
<p>PARTHEID, BUT TE RETS OF THE wORLD SAID NO BELIEVING THE sOVIET SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED PROPAGANDA THAT WORKED.  </p>

		<p>Hopefully, the boycotting of white owned businesses will lead to more boycotting of the white world. Maybe they&rsquo;ll also stop moving en masse into white neighboehoods, destroying white schools and other infrastructure, and stop going after white women.</p>

		<p>Most people of low IQ, regardless of ethnicity, realize that they cannot compete with smarter folks.  Many not-bright blacks, however, have a magical-thinking mentality, and when loony liberals tell them they can be anything they want to be, they picture themselves as pro BB players, rap stars, or successful record producers.  Some go so far as to think they can just take over the chairmanship of a company and run it just like Trump.  And, if they&rsquo;re not given the chance, it&rsquo;s because whitey and his racism is holding them down.  <br>
Blacks have clearly shown that they cannot run a city, county, or country.  If at least some whites are not present in business and law enforcement, majority-black societies cannot function as first-world entities.  If we ever divide the U.S. and have a black nation bordering a white and a brown one, we will just have another Haiti right over the wall.  The only way the majority of blacks can thrive is to be directed and managed by whites, as they were just a few decades ago.</p>

		<p>How about a day of rage for us. Boycott as many things black as possible, starting with the NBA, NFL, NCAA, hiphop, and not just for a weekend but forever. We should even extend it to language. The word is disrespect, not &#8216;dis&rsquo;. And every time I hear some white kid say &#8216;chill&rsquo; I want to slap the snot out of him.</p>

		<p>Yrs. ago here in NYC two blacks lifted my wallet when I was shopping. I knew it was them because they&rsquo;d been right in back of me. I followed them and confronted them publicly. I did not get my $40 back but I did have the satisfaction of standing up for myself. We must not back down.</p>

		<p>I agree with others on here that &#8220;the blacks&#8221; should boycott EVERYTHING White - forever - make us REALLY suffer! PLEASE boycott our White neighborhoods, stores, restaurants, medical facilities, schools and airports. PLEASE boycott everything invented\built by Whites - automobiles, airplanes, trains, houses\apartments, electricity, indoor plumbing, processed foods, clothing, T.V&rsquo;s, washers\dryers, medicines, air conditioning, telephones - etc.. If they&rsquo;re going to boycott, go all the way - keep it reeeeal!<br>
I also think &#8220;the blacks&#8221; should riot\loot in liberal rich White neighborhoods - Beverly Hills, Belair, The Hamptons, Hyannisport, Manhattan, Palm Springs, Holmby Hills, Brentwood and Palm Beach. These are just a few of the &#8220;sanctuaries&#8221; of rich liberal White Obama supporters\black sympathizers that force &#8220;diversity&#8221; down our throats while they live\socialize in safe White neighborhoods and call us red neck racists while at their White country clubs.    </p>

		<p>Our Concern Regarding the Baltimore Incident<br>
We are shocked by the video from a Baltimore franchised restaurant showing an assault.  This incident is unacceptable, disturbing and troubling. McDonald&rsquo;s strives to be a safe, welcoming environment for everyone who visits.  Nothing is more important to us than the safety of customers and employees in our restaurants. We are working with the franchisee and the local authorities to investigate this matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/media_center.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/media_center.html</a></p>
<p><br>
If McDonald&rsquo;s were really concerned, they would have had an armed guard at the restaurant, because they KNOW  that their integrated stores are dangerous for White Humanity.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t mention how inept their black employees were at stopping the violence against the innocent White girl.</p>
<p>She looked like a college student. Too bad she wasn&rsquo;t taught in class to stay away from integrated McDonald&rsquo;s.  Did she believe that Diversity is our Strength before today?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t their press release say that they are calling on the NAACP to reach out to DOJ Holder&rsquo;s &#8220;my people&#8221; community for tips and leads on who the blacks are?<br>

<p>&ldquo;Saturday April 23rd&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t they mean EASTER SATURDAY? I don&rsquo;t like Christianity, and I don&rsquo;t even like Amren&rsquo;s ban on criticising Christianity, but isn&rsquo;t the media not even mentioning Easter getting kind of ridiculous? When the media despises western culture so much that they pretend the West&rsquo;s major cultural festivals don&rsquo;t exist, then you know there&rsquo;s a huge problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; I agree with all of the above, including the idea that an Easter holiday isn&rsquo;t even mentioned.  Easter is the modified name of Eoster, a goddess of fertility that was transferred to Mary (note the famous painting of Mary as Eoster holding an egg signifying the rebirth of nature parlayed by early church fathers into a Christian festival), and the rabbit is a remnant of the March Hare which also was a sign of the return of life and fertility to the land and the people.  Easter is a spring holiday with an obvious Christian veneer, but either way, it is a Western tradition.  Wall Street closed today for &#8220;Good Friday&#8221; without mentioning the holiday.  We have surely achieved the ridiculous in accommodating in the name of Diversity and Multiculturalism.</p>
<p>This is a good example of common ground between white Christians and white neo-Pagans, Asatru, and Celtic traditions.  Don&rsquo;t leave us out, it is a mistake.</p>
