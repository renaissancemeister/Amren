			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Allen, Los Angeles Times, April 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Fullerton man was sentenced Friday to six months in jail and three years&rsquo; probation for twice depositing his semen into a co-worker&rsquo;s water bottle, which she later drank from.</p>
<p>Michael Kevin Lallana, 32, also was ordered by the court to register as a sex offender, according to the Orange County District Attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>He left semen-laced water bottles on his co-worker&rsquo;s desk at Northwestern Mutual Finance Network in Newport Beach last year on two separate occasions, district attorney officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Lallana committed the crime for sexual gratification.</p>
<p>&#8220;He admitted that he was attracted to her, and that it was something about her lips having touched the water bottle that turned him on,&#8221; Deputy Dist. Atty. Brock Zimmon said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lallana was arrested last July, and his DNA later was matched to the water bottle. He did not testify at his trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her attorney, Gloria Allred, said the most important aspect of the sentencing was that Lallana must register as a sex offender.</p>

Southeast Asians and micronesian-polynesians are notorious  perverts.</p>
<p>Back in the 1990&rsquo;s, ejaculating inside a cup to watch a woman (read white woman) drink it was considered by them to be a sick fantasy reward for spreading their Socialist creed on the streets.</p>
<p>Southeast asians view alot of pornography and view white women as sex objects.<br>
They will hire white teen prostitutes to perform sex acts at house parties and dawn ski masks to expose themselves in the dorm rooms of college campuses.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m certainly no supporter of mass immigration, but repellant as this is, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a uniquely latino crime. Sadly it&rsquo;s not as if we don&rsquo;t have our own sexual deviants. </p>

<p>He looks White to you?! Are you kidding me?! He is probably mixed race and an immigrant to boot, but he sure ain&rsquo;t White. Although, as someone commented above, he will probably be recorded on crime databases as White.</p>

		<p>Lots of luck getting a decent job anytime soon, Lallana!  Any sort of sexual harrassment at work is a major hot-button for employers, because usually when it happens, it is the business that gets stuck with the lawsuit, and not the individual harrasser.</p>
<p>I was disappointed to read no mention of the actual charge on which the creep was convicted.  It may well have simply been something like a &#8220;food adulteration&#8221; charge with some sort of enhancement for the sexual aspect.  It also doesn&rsquo;t say how much time off he can get off for trustee work and good behavior.  Using Colorado&rsquo;s rules, on six months, he could get 12 off as good time.  For trustee work, and additional third of whatever&rsquo;s left comes off.  That would leave 114 days, or just under four months.  I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way a four-month sentence is going to change this pervert&rsquo;s mind - but - the three years on paper will leave plenty of time for Lallana to get caught reoffending.</p>
<p>The lawyer was right; the sex-offender registry is the real dinner-winner, because even if this conviction was a misdemeanor, any failure by Lallana to later register is a felony, and off he&rsquo;d go to a fun place like Solidad or San Quinten for a few years.</p>

<p>Who knows? He may have done stuff like this many times before and this was just the one time he got caught. I find it very unlikely a guy is 32 years old and just suddenly becomes a sexual pervert.</p>

<p>There are so many &#8220;latino&#8221; crimes in this country and YES, they are deviant and perverted crimes! EVERYDAY where I live, it is mexican crime after mexican crime.</p>
<p> Also would you believe there were alot of black SERIAL killers? Probably not, because the media never reports it. Maybe you can google it.</p>
<p>They only report &#8220;white&#8221; crimes when in fact, many of these perps are NOT of the White race, even though they may &#8220;look&#8221; White.  </p>

<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a hard one to pin down. At first, I had guessed Mexican, maybe. But further photos show as more Asian. </p>
<p>Philipino perhaps, but I&rsquo;m guessing somewhere in the South Pacific   &mdash;   maybe Tonga, Samoa, somewhere around there.  Just an educated guess.</p>
<p>And the name doesn&rsquo;t seem quite Spanish,  but that&rsquo;s hard to pin too.</p>

Problem is, where I live there are lots of hispanics AND blacks. A no win situation.</p>
<p> This city has changed drastically from 40 years ago, like most American cities have done. ALL of the smaller towns surrounding us are now 90% hispanic. They used to be 95% WHITE 30 years ago.<br>

How was this sick act discoverd?</p>
<p><i>I bet she took a drink from the bottle, and said, &#8216;Hey-this water tastes like semen!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Uh, not exactly.</p>
<p>This story got a lot of local play in the media in S. Cal, mostly for the laugh and &#8220;yuk&#8221; factor   &mdash;  and that the victim is a nice looking blonde female, the racial angle I believe.</p>
<p>Here are the salient details about which you inquired (hope you haven&rsquo;t eaten yet, I almost barfed in my car when I heard the details over the radio!).</p>
<p><i>The victim, who was unaware of the bottle&rsquo;s contents, drank the contaminated water. She threw it away after feeling sick, investigators say.</i></p>
<p>Three months later, the victim and six other employees, including the defendant, were transferred to the Northwestern Mutual Mortgage Company&rsquo;s Orange branch. That&rsquo;s where a second incident occurred, according to officials.</p>
<p>On April 9, 2010, Lallana is accused of assaulting the same victim by depositing his ejaculation into another water bottle that the victim left on her desk. The victim took a sip from the bottle, then felt sick. She decided to send the specimen to a private lab to be tested.</p>
<p>The lab contacted her and told her the water bottle contained semen, police said.</p>
<p>The victim then notified the Orange Police Department .</p>
<p>DNA tests confirmed the semen belonged to Lallana.</p>
<p>Hope that clears everything up, and as noted above:   EWWWWWW</p>
<p>Bon<br>

<p><i>There are some sick people out there!</i></p>
<p>I read the article you posted, the one sbuffalo submitted as well.</p>
<p>Horrible! And Sick.</p>
<p>A colleague once told me about a kid urinating in the back of her classroom because she refused to let him use the restroom (this is a tough one for teachers, I admit).</p>
<p>Student was immediately suspended with a possible transfer to a school for emotionally disturbed students,  the school psychologist called in for a full evaluation, the health department notified and a report filed and child social services alerted  to evaluate the kid&rsquo;s home life and to find the &#8220;root&#8221; cause of what made this &#8220;poor child&#8221; commit such an act.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t find out the results, but it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the teacher were suspended without pay and transferred and the child given a medal for bringing &#8220;teacher abuse&#8221; to light.</p>
<p>Bon<br>
