			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diamond Leung, ESPN, April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Connecticut star guard Kemba Walker announced today he would forgo his senior season and enter the NBA draft. It was an expected move not only because he led the Huskies to a national championship, but also because he had participated in Senior Day festivities and is set to graduate from school in three years. </p>
<p>According to Sports Illustrated, Walker appears to have gone through college having only recently completed reading an entire book for the first time. </p>
<p>And in his travel pack is a copy of New York Times columnist William C. Rhoden&rsquo;s Forty Million Dollar Slaves: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of the Black Athlete, a book that Crump encouraged Walker to read as part of an independent study class on racism in sports. Before the Final Four, [academic counselor Felicia] Crump suggested that Rhoden&rsquo;s book would be the first that Walker had ever made it through cover-to-cover. After the win over Kentucky, Walker confirmed this. &#8220;That&rsquo;s true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can write that. It is the first book I&rsquo;ve ever read.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I just need to finish up strong,&#8221; Walker told reporters. &#8220;It won&rsquo;t be hard. I&rsquo;m gonna take all the time I need to graduate and most likely I will.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Three years of college, four years of high school, and nine years before then   &mdash;   Add that together, and you have 16 years of education.  Only now is he having to read an entire book from cover to cover?  And not just any book, leftist anti-white agitprop at that that is probably 90% lies.  Yes, there&rsquo;s racism in sports, but this book isn&rsquo;t exactly written by Don Wassall or J.B. Cash.</p>
<p>Question to AR readers:  When was the earliest grade that you remember being assigned to read a full length book?  And by &#8220;book,&#8221; I mean adult material, not a children&rsquo;s picture book.  If my memory serves, my earliest assigned book came in the 4th Grade.</p>

		<p>I would give $40 Million dollars to lock &#8220;Kemba&#8221; in a room with: A) A Chinese mine worker who spends every day underneath the earth for $50 a month, B) A Russian street begger displaced by 100 years of Communism, or C) A South American small farmer living on subsistence meals and struggling to find a way to not get on the bad side of the multitude of druglords on each side, and then have &#8220;Kemba&#8221; tell them how he is a &#8220;slave&#8221; with his multi-millions. After fifteen minutes only one would walk out and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the &#8220;brutha.&#8221; The lowliest underclass welfare Black lives a life of unimagined wealth and prosperity compared to those doing legitimate work or trying to merely find enough to eat in this world. And EVERYONE needs to call &#8220;Kemba&#8221; on it.</p>

<p>I know the stereotype for athletes of all races in college.  But if you are &#8216;riding the bus&rsquo; for all those hours.  Surely you might give yourself something more rewarding than a case of eyestrain watching a movie on your micro laptop or listening to rap on your I-Pod.</p>
<p>If you are at college, you should be doing -something- to activate the skills in your mind.  If you are at college to play sports, your spot in class should be taken by someone who is there to get on with their life.</p>
<p>_College_ is a terrible thing to waste on an underachiever with a great jump shot.</p>

		<p>Yes, these poor, poooor black atheletes facing &#8216;racism&rsquo; in sports. I feel so sorry for them. Making millions upon millions a season, drive nice flashy cars, live in nice mansions, can say anything they want about whites (or any race) without losing endorsements, and can engage in the most reprehensive and illegal activities without fear of censure.  Must be tough.  My heart bleeds so much.</p>

Forty Million Dollar Slaves</p>
<p>That there is even such a book with this title is amazing. What would it cost not to be considered a slave? 80 million? 16 million?</p>

<p>He we go again. A black athlete who ops to leave college for the pros. If or when he fizzles out and doesn&rsquo;t have the education to do anything other than play basketball, the next group of people are going to come along screaming that the school didn&rsquo;t live up to it&rsquo;s obligation and he didn&rsquo;t get the education he was promised.</p>

		<p>White people,<br/>
Always keep in mind that you are the reason that they are there. Do you think that blacks would tolerate (let alone pay for) the nonsense that the NBA pushes as &#8220;sport&#8221;? Whites are funding their own destruction. If you don&rsquo;t like this kind of nonsense, don&rsquo;t fund it. In other words, &#8220;don&rsquo;t buy tickets&#8221;, &#8220;don&rsquo;t buy tee shirts&#8221;, &#8220;don&rsquo;t buy sports memorabilia&#8221;! Whites who pay for this are idiots! They are spineless jerks that don&rsquo;t understand the rules of life and survival! Does this get you angry? Good! Are you going to do something about it? Probably not. You jerks will just go back to watching basketball or attending their games. Or, you&rsquo;ll go to NFL games. Because you don&rsquo;t see how this will destroy you and your future progeny. You are pathetic! You deserve what&rsquo;s surely coming!</p>

		<p>*According to Sports Illustrated, Walker appears to have gone through college having only recently completed reading an entire book for the first time.</p>
<p>How can someone go through college having only read ONE BOOK? And of course the book was on &#8220;RACISM&#8221;! I&rsquo;m sure some liberal White girl had read it out loud for him because he looks as if hes not that bright! Whats even worse is that some White kid who studied hard and got good grades was probably passed over to allow this thug into the college because hes a good &#8216;bassetball&rsquo; player, and the clueless White students who acually EARNED their way there treat him like a God because he won the &#8220;national championship&#8221;. I&rsquo;m sure they bend over backward ( and probably forward ) to make sure that he wants for nothing. What they fail to realize is that he hates every one of them and will eventually &#8220;go off&#8221; on them if they &#8220;dis&#8221; him in any way, especially if they start to question his academic qualifications. He knows he doesn&rsquo;t belong there and will react violently to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;go along&#8221; with the game.      </p>

		<p>I used to walk up to our local public library and borrow Hardy Boys books during the summer of 3rd and 4th grade.  There was a series of Alfred Hitchcock books for boys at the time (mid 1960s) and a series of outer space books, the name of which escapes me.  I have been reading, on my own, for at least 46 years.</p>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s anything that illustrates the insanity of our modern-day society, it&rsquo;s this. I couldn&rsquo;t make up anything better! </p>
<p>A college student, and he&rsquo;s proud to admit he&rsquo;s read only one book in his life? And it&rsquo;s a book of black racial grievance too. In other words, hating on the white man who&rsquo;s given him everything he&rsquo;s got.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no bias in college sports admissions. Nosiree! You can see his intelligence level in his face.</p>
<p>I agree with Anonymous at 8:36 PM: it&rsquo;s whites who patronize black sports who help to subsidize this insanity.</p>

		<p>There is a story that Nichael Jordan was being interviewed by a number of reporters. He was laughing and joking and easily handling their questions until one reporter asked what was the last book he read. He couldn&rsquo;t think of any unril someone gave him the title of a fawning autobiography he cowrote with someone. He was one of the smarter ones.<br/>
  The summer between 7th and 8th grade, I read &#8220;All Quiet on the Western Front,&#8221; &#8220;Currarre: by Donald Burkett, and &#8220;1000 Destroyed.&#8221; by Glover Hall. I had read books for boys, including the Heinlein books. So I read more books before I got into High School than this guy. He mau make more money than me, but I have no restect for him.<br/>

I had a 7th grade English teacher who accused me of not reading the assignement in class once by saying that even HE couldn`t have finished it that quickly. I then recounted how the hero had fallen in the ice machine etc. etc. etc. He apologized and I told him the two drop off spots for my mom in summer were the pool and the library&hellip;</p>

		<p>Academically, this individual simply takes up space.  The American university system, as with all institutionalized educational systems in American, has evolved into a huge degree mill.  No doubt this individual is able to bounce a round ball on a wood floor but to accomplish something within the realm of societal or academic quality, doubts arise.<br/>
       <br/>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna take all the time I need to graduate and most likely I will.&rdquo;  No question, he will.  With Affirmative Action running rampant, within the university system, he should look to pursue higher education, law, or medicine.</p>
<p>Yes, he has read his first book after many years in the public educational system.  What does that say about this present social order and the society we (European Americans/Europeans) have been given?<br/>

		<p>I was skimming through the comments on the original article and the general consensus of ESPN &#8220;readers&#8221; is that reading is over-rated.

<p>While it might be easy to dismiss the &#8220;reading is overrated&#8221; mentality among ESPN readers and viewers to the typical cobweb-tween-the-ears mindset of the typical sports nut, that is precisely the mentality of a lot of neo-Marxist professors who fill various schools of education   &mdash;   That reading is &#8220;bourgeoise,&#8221; and therefore unnecessary.  </p>

		<p>Let me give another angle. I spoke with a relative of a friend of mine a few years ago; he attended two colleges and got a law degree in ~1995. He told me that black athletes have unlimited sexual opportunities with the coeds. If they had the stamina, they could go at it 24/7. </p>
<p>He had a GPA of 3.7, and he took grad courses in philosophy and language. He admitted that if he could have had the same sexual success as the black athletes, he would have flunked out in his freshman year. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider Kemba&rsquo;s situation when we judge him.</p>

Recently, my Mom remarked (from her, this is an indictment, not praise): &#8220;Do you realize that of all the boys you dated, every single one is now rich?  And they all still look like those &#8216;Hunks&rsquo;. Nobody else your age is married to a Muscle-Man. What is it with you?&#8221;  Read the right books&hellip;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember being assigned a full-length book until Junior High (Mississippi, you know&hellip;).  I dove off the deep end, and went straight for &#8216;To the Lighthouse&rsquo;, by Virginia Woolf, which got me in trouble, because an Aunt had never heard of the Author, and thought it was the screenplay for &#8220;That NASTY movie&#8221; (I suspect &#8216;Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf&rsquo; had Elizabeth Taylor saying &#8216;d  &mdash;  n&rsquo;, or something equally unthinkable).  So Mother snatched that away from me, and I finished the book report with &#8216;Becky Sharp&rsquo;, which was just fine, since Becky wore Hoopskirts, and was thus a good role model for girls. </p>
<p>Also from Kon Tiki came my first inklings regarding the superiority of Scandic types.  And the story in that book, of the slaying, on the shores of Lake Titicaca, of the Redheaded Giants&hellip;. after they&rsquo;d made the mistake of sharing their technology with the nonwhites&hellip;. stuck with me.  What a prescient tale, considering what is happening today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indian kids are far ahead of whites&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah sure, that&rsquo;s why so many Indians leave India to come and live in Great Britain, Canada, the USA, Australia, etc, (any white country they can weasel their way into). Because we all know what a wonderful and prosperous place India is. Its not like there are vast numbers of impoverished people there now, is it? (Sarcasm off).</p>

		<p>Reply to #33: ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, SIR! Thank goodness someone said it! Indians (and other Third Worlders) always claim to have such pride&hellip;.yet ALWAYS invade Western nations and go after Western women. Is this pride? Hardly! This is a deep-seated inferiority complex which compels them to go where they are not wanted, to a society they reject, and then proclaim at the top of their lungs that they are superior! If India is so great, WHY LEAVE? You can wear your turban 24/7, pray to little blue figures, never bathe, and eat rancid food all you like&hellip;if that IS what you like. If the Third World is Nirvanna, then WHY COME HERE? We all know the answer, and you Indians do too. We&rsquo;re better and you can&rsquo;t survive without us. Sad, but true. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d still be at home in the village.</p>

		<p>I read &#8220;Moby Dick&#8221; from cover to cover when I was in the 5th grade, at 10 years old. So Kemba Walker&rsquo;s &#8220;achievement&#8221; of having read his first book at UConn means absolutely nothing.</p>

		<p>I remember being in the midst of Helter Skelter in the midst of my 4th grade free reading period, when the horrified schoolmarm, all prim and proper, snatched it right from my hands.</p>
