<h1>Would You Like to Write for Teaching Tolerance?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Ann Williamson, Teaching Tolerance (SPLC), April 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Teaching Tolerance wants to expand its corps of bloggers. We are looking for teachers, administrators and school counselors who can reflect on day-to-day school experiences. Candidates should be familiar with Teaching Tolerance&rsquo;s mission: to promote respect for differences and an appreciation of diversity in the classroom and beyond.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to educators who have written a blog previously. However, other editorial writing experience is a plus.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, contact us at editor@TeachingTolerance.org. {snip}</p>
<p>Teaching Tolerance pays $50 per published post. Some writers will receive more money if they&rsquo;re able to produce at least three posts per month. {snip}<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think there will be much in the way of original prose here.  It&rsquo;ll be nothing more than repeating the same old leftist mantras, Control+C Shift+Insert.  But it would be a good way to drain the SPLC&rsquo;s bank account just a little bit.</p>

<p> This self-appointed bunch of guardians of our moral purity is about as intolerant of any belief they don&rsquo;t agree with as any group or individual I can think of. They&rsquo;ve even started monitoring, and posting comments on, a small blog website in my hometown because of a few comments that I and a few other people posted on there. &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221;?! Ha! Double Ha!</p>

		<p>Whenever a liberal uses the word, &#8220;tolerance&#8221;, I always ask. &#8220;Tolerance of what?&#8221;. </p>
<p>This has never failed to derail the liberal. They may respond, &#8220;You know, well uh, well tolerant of people who are different!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I respond, &#8220;Different in what way? I don&rsquo;t tolerate people who [I insert a type that the liberal detests], do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, the liberal changes the subject or leaves.</p>

<p>Why does positive experience with tolerance supersede negative experience with diversity? Is my negative experience any less valid?</p>
<p>My experience with people who practice tolerance is one where people have to make excuses for bad behavior and place blame on others. I once told someone about an incident I had with a black man and he actually told me that I had to cut the guy some slack because of the historic mistreatment of blacks by whites.<br>

		<p>They don&rsquo;t &#8220;teach tolerance&#8221; at all.  They teach tolerance of all values which are non-European while engaging in blatant slander against those of European descent.  In short, they teach tolerance of THEIR ideas, which is hardly tolerance at all.  Odd coming from a group of people who claim to be &#8220;tolerant&#8221;.  Yes, tolerant of their side and their side only.</p>

		<p>Re posts  #3 and #7<br>
It probably is not necessary to write FOR  SPLC  &mdash;  but simply to<br>
put something on a website directed toward infusing their Teaching Tolerance with scientific realism and practical avoidance of lose-lose situations in which differing races are compressed together (prisons, public schools, many workplaces ). The upshot of our own  reality-based TT program might well be to nurture separatism all around, but in here-and-now necessities, it ought to provide a sounder bassis to lubricate the clashing gears of coerced association than would a utopian-based TT. TT has been a very brilliant and successful propaganda ploy for SPLC.  Years ago David Duke put a TT contribution on his webpage that is infused with both scientific realism and his own political values.<br>
I imagine schools willing to listen, could modify the TT program if the modifications were explicit and overt.  I still see TT as an important undertaking that should have come from our own ranks  &mdash;  not from Rolling Hills, AL.  Job One in any struggle from within the ranks is to see and admit the strengths and merits of the enemy and our own weaknesses and mistakes.  Frankly, that seems to be too big a challenge for many of the people in our ranks.  </p>

		<p>I sent them a sample of what I thought that I could write for them. I wonder what they will think of it.  </p>
<p>The Mantra</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;The Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded than Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to &#8220;assimilate,&#8221; i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;How long would it take anyone to realize I&rsquo;m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn&rsquo;t object to this?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.&#8221; </p>

		<p>To teach tolerance, they say?  Is this an international thing?  As in, will there be any teaching the Chinese to improve their society by making it less Chinese, or teaching Nigeria to tolerate becoming less Nigerian?  </p>
<p>Or is this being trained to tolerate one&rsquo;s own dispossession only for white countries?</p>
<p>I merely ask&hellip; </p>

		<p>One of the icons of $PLC&rsquo;s &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; is Obama&rsquo;s buddy, Bill Ayers, the unrepentant Weatherman terrorist. According to police informant Larry Grathwohl, Ayers and the other Weather people discussed the goal of exterminating 25 million reactionary Americans in order to reach their goal of &#8220;social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this the &#8220;tolerance&#8221; that the $PLC gang its fellow travelers would teach if they attained the power to do so? Lest we have occasion to find out, we&rsquo;d better make sure they never get that power.   </p>

		<p>SPLC is always recruiting at my law school and on the website.</p>
<p>Here is one such recent job posting from a few weeks ago. I guess the job is to sue schools who suspend &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; numbers of blacks and hispanics and defend promising young scholars of color like the Jenna 6 from evil school administrators who wrongly discpline them for minor offenses like stomping on another studen&rsquo;s head. </p>

		<p>Guys, there is more to this madness than what may appear. </p>
<p>There are dark and nefarious forces behind the present world order today. </p>
<p>The numbers are simple to comprehend, but the underlying perfidy that led to these numbers baffles the mind: </p>
<p>In 1950, Europeans were more than 33% of global population; today whites are less than 8%. </p>
<p>Please think about that for a moment. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China went from half a billion souls in 1975 to over 1.3 billion today. </p>
<p>Idem for Africa, which doubled its population to one billion hapless, hungry layabouts, BUT, in the breathtakingly short period of 30 years. </p>
<p>They doubled their population in 1.5 generations.</p>
<p>From half a billion to one billion in thirty short years. </p>
<p>My. Oh. My. And guess who made this demographic EXPLOSION possible? </p>
<p>European civilization is responsible for 99% of world events - Alas, there&rsquo;s really no other way to look at things: </p>
<p>Libya : they didn&rsquo;t have electricity 50 years ago ; </p>
<p>Japan : white guys from GE conceived of, designed, and oversaw the building of those nuclear plants in 1971 ; </p>
<p>Ivory Coast : France&rsquo;s former colony, one of the only West African cities to have lots of skyscrapers, would be an expanse of huts and impoverished villagers were it not for France&rsquo;s &#8220;enriching&#8221; role in that place&hellip; and the list goes on. </p>
<p>Who was behind the Industrial Revolution that has benefited 100% of humanity? </p>
<p>Who was behind 99% of the creative thinking that led to 99% of the technology that supports 99.9% of the working infrastructure of the world today, from paved roadway to eyeglasses to the printed word to ice cream for Goodness Sakes? </p>
<p>Answer: It was not the ethnic Samoans.  It was not sub-Saharan Africans. It was not Eskimos, nor American Indians, nor desert-dwelling Berber types. </p>
<p>Whites have dug their own grave by their (competitive altruism-based) kindness to non-whites, in the form of giving away lifesaving (and indeed, life-creating) technologies, such as anti-AIDS medications. </p>
<p>I wonder if it is too late for Western Civilization, I really do. </p>
<p>Thankfully there are men like Jared Taylor, who go against the prevailing winds of the dogma that passes for official in Western society, and he does it with the courage of the true dissident. </p>
<p>Please visit and contribute written material (in the comments section, when possible) to the site below that seeks to undo this crazy anti-Western message projected in the pages of America&rsquo;s &#8220;newspaper of record,&#8221; the New York Times.  </p>

<p>If we had a Federal government that made sense, then they&rsquo;d take the SPLC to court for that job posting alone.  The SPLC doesn&rsquo;t work to do anything other than make its founder rich and its high level employees very comfortable.  And it doesn&rsquo;t primarily use &#8220;juvenile justice&#8221; as its primary fund raising schtick.  </p>
