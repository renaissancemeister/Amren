<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/us/politics/20immig.html?_r=4">Immigration Is Lead Topic as Leaders Are Gathered</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julia Preston, New York Times, April 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama told a gathering of business, labor, religious and political leaders at the White House on Tuesday that he remains committed to an overhaul of the nation&rsquo;s immigration laws and wants to try again in the coming months to push Congress to pass a bill.</p>
<p>With his re-election campaign launched this month and Latino communities growing increasingly frustrated with his immigration policies, Mr. Obama summoned more than 60 high-profile supporters of the stalled overhaul legislation to a strategy session, looking for ways to revive it. Among those attending were Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, an independent; Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio, a Democrat; and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He sought views on whether to try to pass smaller pieces of the massive overhaul, such as a bill that would give legal status to illegal immigrant students, or one that would increase visas for highly skilled foreign workers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem for Obama with the salami slicing strategy:  It would be more effective into getting all or most of what he wants, but it would also means there would not be one massive bill signing for something called &#8220;comprehensive immigration reform&#8221; that he can trot out to impress Hispanic politicos and voters.  If he&rsquo;s thinking long term for the Democrat Party, then salami slicing is better.  If he&rsquo;s thinking about himself for 2012, and getting the Hispanic vote jazzed again, he&rsquo;ll try for a &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; big bill.</p>

		<p>My Question:  What will a Republican do in his place?</p>
<p>It is also the question you need to ask.  Because it is the one the Hispanics will be.  They realize that they are not yet enough of a force to be dominant in U.S. politics and they are starting to see the negative consequences (Blacks -AND- Hispanics = double the sour grapes from whites) of &#8216;coalition politics&rsquo; as a polarizing influence upon whites.</p>
<p>So the big question comes, even as they are accepting the gladhanding and stated intentions of a black president, _what if hispanics vote Republican_?</p>
<p>And the answer is&hellip;??</p>
<p>Would a Republican looking to secure an election make (closed door) promises to a Hispanic element looking to get serious naturalization concessions?</p>
<p>Given the policies of the Bushes, Reagan and others, it must be assumed so.</p>
<p>Until whites tell Republicans that they will not vote for a non-moratorium candidate, we will get -no where- as a race preserving people because our vote will be assumed and we will have no real voice.</p>
<p>Which is why it may well be in our best interests to either endorse a third party candidate who does make pro-white choices.  Or to allow Obama his reelection bid on the basis of Republican Whiskey Delta Refusal to stand up and say: &#8220;Not just no but I mean _NEVER_!&#8221; to present day amnesty-as-vote-buying appeasement to illegal immigration.  Which is Republican sponsored just as much as it is Democratic.</p>
<p>We obviously live in a world where no recall means a politician&rsquo;s promise means don&rsquo;t anything more than &#8220;I tried my best, sorry&hellip;&#8221; once they get into office (or back there).</p>
<p>But a condition where the backside of a promise that is foresworn by a President who refuses to do what he says is different from that of a man who says, up front, that he is for moratoriums on immigration.  ONLY that man deserves our vote.</p>
<p>If Obama falls we cannot replace him with &#8216;just another republican&rsquo;.</p>
