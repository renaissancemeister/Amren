			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce A. Dixon, Black Agenda Report, April 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It was the summer of 2007, and I was in the study of a prominent black Atlanta pastor. The conversation turned, as did so many that season to the coming presidential election, still a good 16 months away. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to unite and build a wall, a solid black wall around Brother Obama,&#8221; the reverend declared.</p>
<p>I tried to ask whether one man&rsquo;s career was really more important than the needs of forty million black people, what obligations candidate Obama would owe the black community, and how we might ensure these were fulfilled. But the pastor wasn&rsquo;t hearing any of this. All the obligations, in his view, seemed to flow from the bottom up, while the power flowed from the top down. It&rsquo;s never easy to stop a preacher on a roll.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can build that solid black wall,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if we can unite black people behind Brother Obama, he will have the power to do anything he wants to do. Can&rsquo;t you see it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If we do that, nothing any of his opponents say or do will be able to touch him.&#8221; Almost four years later, it looks like black America&rsquo;s legacy leadership are still following the pastor&rsquo;s playbook.</p>
<p>The black political wall around Barack Obama is a reality, and one of the president&rsquo;s most powerful political assets. It trades upon African America&rsquo;s historic credibility as a people of struggle, the people who produced Nat Turner and Ida B. Wells, Charles Hamilton Houston, Kwame Toure and Martin Luther King and many, many others. </p>
<p>White liberals and progressives often tend to follow the lead of black America, whether right or wrong. You want to know what you should do? The president&rsquo;s black and black people are supporting him? What else do you need to know? But who is inside that wall, and who is outside? Who does the black wall the Atlanta preacher described protect Barack Obama against?</p>
<p><b>The black wall around Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t protect him from the war makers and war criminals of the bipartisan military industrial complex. </b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The black wall around Barack Obama protects the president, but it protects the war machine too. But while black America remains the most antiwar section of the U.S. polity, black critics of the imperial wars are not heard. They are on the outside of Obama&rsquo;s black wall. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The black wall around Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t protect him from greedy Wall Street banksters and corporate thugs.</b></p>
<p>Like the war makers, the banksters were inside the Barack&rsquo;s wall long before the inauguration, even before the election. {snip}<br>
Homes are the principal assets of most who have them. The continuing wave of foreclosures, disproportionately affecting black families, is the most serious raid on black wealth in decades, widening the already vast wealth gap between blacks and whites.</p>
<p>{snip} Those opposed to the foreclosures, who want to rein in and prosecute Wall Street predators, who organize against foreclosures find themselves outside Barack Obama&rsquo;s black wall, not inside it. ACORN registered voters to elect this president. But Obama stood by and watched them falsely accused, smeared and broken.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The black wall around Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t protect him against the forces aiming to privatize public education</b></p>
<p>From the beginning President Obama has been an enthusiastic supporter of efforts to blame and defame public school teachers, and to charterize and privatize public education. As Chicago Schools CEO his infamous Secretary of Education fired hundreds of dedicated, qualified Chicago teachers in order to replace their schools with charters. Obama has taken Duncan&rsquo;s failed Chicago policies national, firing for example, a whole school district of teachers in Providence, Rhode Island. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
<b>The black wall around Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t protect him against Republican-led assaults on democratic rights.</b></p>
<p>Restrictive voter-ID laws are proliferating in Republican-led legislatures across the country with the clear intent of reducing the number of student and minority voters. Perhaps the first was in Georgia, where the Voting Rights Act gives the US Justice Department authority to block any changes in election law that disproportionately affect blacks. {snip}</p>
<p>The traditional black leadership are so bankrupt that when right wing propagandist Andrew Breitbart smeared Shirley Sherrod, a local human rights activist of 45 years standing, even the NAACP, who doubtless knew her history, rushed endorsed the calumny. Shirley Sherrod, along with millions of black, brown and young voters are on the outside of Barack Obama&rsquo;s wall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Unions are outside Barack Obama&rsquo;s black wall too, although he gratefully accepts their campaign contributions, and allows their leaders to sit on commissions and meet with him from time to time. Union leaders invited the president to come to Madison, Wisconsin during the face-off with the legislature. Fortunately, he declined. They invited the vice-president. He demurred. They invited the Secretary of Labor. No way. Here again, the president&rsquo;s freeze on the pay and rights of federal workers set the stage for Republican moves to take it one step further.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>In every case, the black wall around Barack Obama protects him not from Tea Partyers and Republican foes, whom he is anxious to meet more than half way. The black wall around Barack Obama protects him from accountability to black people, to his supposed base. </b></p>
<p>Increasingly we can expect the White House and its allies will demand that all grassroots political agitation and organizing not explicitly connected with turning out the vote for the president and his party cease. That&rsquo;s been the traditional pattern. Antiwar movements, housing and human rights work, all of it folds in even numbered years, as activists allow all their efforts to be diverted into electing Democrats. </p>
<p>As 2012 looms, the black wall around Obama remains a crucial asset. It&rsquo;s why his first campaign appearance will be on the arm of Al Sharpton. The pressure will be on to circle the wagons again, to build the wall higher. As the pastor predicted, the black wall around Barack Obama wall insulates the president against his foes, not from the right, but from the left. It protects the president not against the Pentagon, the banksters, the corporate thugs, the privatizers and the Republicans, all of whom he seems to get along with just fine  &mdash;  but against us. It makes him democracy-proof and people-proof. It protects him against his own supposed base.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for black America to answer the questions the Atlanta pastor wouldn&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s more important? Stopping the foreclosures, ending war and mass incarceration, reining in the banks and corporadoes, saving the public education and the environment, creating jobs and doing justice? Or protecting and prolonging the career of one man, a man who doesn&rsquo;t protect us?<br>

		<p>Black people support their own, regardless of what they do.  OJ, for instance, called dating black women &#8220;shoveling coal&#8221;.  He lived in a world that was 99% white and performed no charitable acts for poor blacks.  Of course, blacks fully expect this from each other.  Thus, they tend to be very self-centered and view the success of another black in a vicarious way.  <br>
Obama could probably leave Michelle for a white woman and be overheard calling his supporters the N-word and still get 95% of their votes.</p>

<p>You mean to tell me we have a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; number of blacks running around with no identification to speak of! How do they cash their welfare checks then! More likely, blacks do not want to see hispanic illegal invaders disenfranchised since they seem to believe illegal invaders are supportive of their so called &#8220;causes,&#8221; and vote accordingly.</p>
<p>What blacks always seem to forget is that hispanics hate blacks more than they do whites and are only hijacking their &#8220;struggle&#8221; in order to rise to power. Blacks will be the first to be cast aside once la raza arrives and no longer needs them in their efforts to overthrow &ldquo;whitey.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s simple enough.  The vast majority of blacks will support Obama because he is black.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what he actually does, even if he were to attack blacks and hurt them, the emotional loyalty overrides any rational considerations.</p>

There&rsquo;s a lot to plow through on this one.</p>
<p>What I take from it is that President Obama hasn&rsquo;t delivered what blacks expected he would; programs and money given to them and a black President who would take down the white man and dismantle the white power structure.</p>
<p>Blacks see their mythical gravy train going off track. President Obama isn&rsquo;t giving them what America OWES them and instead of taking the white man down, he took the side of the greedy racists.</p>
<p><i>black America remains the most antiwar section of the U.S. polity</i></p>
<p>Blacks are anti-war for the same reason they&rsquo;re anti-NASA. They believe the money spent on these programs would be better spent given to them.</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, I&rsquo;ll bet come the next election, blacks will again support him at nearly 100%. Watch for it.<br>

<p><i>But while black America remains the most antiwar section of the U.S. polity&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I wish they would translate that anti-war sentiments to their personal lives, and quit murdering each other and non-blacks at the prodigious rate that they do.</p>

<p>In reality, this &#8220;black wall&#8221; around Obama is nothing more than the same black wall around any serious Democrat.  And it has nothing to do with the litany of pet black/leftist causes this columnist lists.  It all has to do with welfare goodies.</p>

		<p>So, when black people voted for Obama, what were they expecting?  Listening to them talk, one would think they wanted Obama to clear the White race from every possible position of authority, give White jobs to black people, oppress the White race as we have oppressed them for hundreds of years, and ultimately cut the White race off at the knees.  Who is racist now?</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s slightly refreshing to see a small trickle of blacks criticizing the great god Obama, but not really, because they always seem to do so for the wrong reasons. For example, it&rsquo;s true that public school teachers have been &#8220;blamed and defamed&#8221; for years, but this is not on account of Obama. Schoolteachers are blamed and defamed to avoid admitting that some of the students are simply less capable than others. If that kind of thing is not permitted, then blaming the teachers is the only thing that&rsquo;s left.</p>

<p>  If blacks vote nearly 100% for Obama come the next presidential election&hellip;perhaps whites who think and tell us that blacks aren&rsquo;t in favor of their own race, and ONLY their race&hellip;boy them doubting whites will get a surprise! </p>
<p>In very small terms, if blacks want the white race to support them more (other than being forced to pay and provide nearly everything they have and own at our very expense), please vote for the white man as long as things turn around in the blacks non-favor. Maybe at least to a point where blacks can&rsquo;t hold out their hand and wait for whitey to give them their daily bread.  </p>

		<p>I have a theory about blacks and their resistance to providing ID when voting.  Having worked, unfortunately enough, in a convenience store with a high percentage of black customers, it struck me as bizarre how many of them had an absolute fit when carded for purchasing &#8220;rillos&#8221; or alcohol.  Granted, white customers  &mdash;  especially younger ones for whatever reason  &mdash;  would get upset about having to provide proof of age, but they would generally pull out ID rather than go somewhere else and deal with the same routine.  Blacks, however, would go into a literal rage about it.  I asked one of the other clerks about this, and he said that the main reasons for them not wanting to provide ID was either that they did not have it  &mdash;  driver&rsquo;s license suspended/taken away by the judge and not smart enough to go down and get a non driver&rsquo;s ID card  &mdash;  or else they simply did not carry ID with them because they had outstanding warrants and figured that if they did not have ID on them, the popo would throw up their hands and not arrest them.  I imagine the same thinking occurs at voting time, as well.  Evil yt judge takes the driver&rsquo;s license away, they are no longer allowed to vote.  It would be quite unfair to make them go down to the local DMV and get a free ID what with to vote.  Or else  &mdash;  the evil republicans might set up a sting operation at the local voting booths to catch all of brothers and sisters with outstanding warrants.</p>
<p>Fairly random, but this guy mentions Nat Turner as a heroic example of black defiance.  I won&rsquo;t go into the background of Nat Turner  &mdash;  if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the story of this vile creature, it&rsquo;s easy enough to find the facts online.  As I said, this is random, but if you ever take grad courses in English Lit, you&rsquo;re required to take a course as an introduction to research techniques.  I imagine it&rsquo;s fairly standard across the board, and most of them use (or used to use) a standard text, can&rsquo;t think of the name offhand.  One of the questions for research dealt with the critical reaction to &#8220;Confessions of Nat Turner&#8221; by William Styron.  While looking for information on this question, I came across a book containing some sort of &#8220;forum&#8221; with black &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; grilling Styron about the book.  The level of discourse, with Styron&rsquo;s exception, was at roughly the same level as that found in this article.  I&rsquo;ve never read &#8220;confessions,&#8221; but I do know that the biggest beef from the black &#8220;intellectual&#8221; community was the fact that Styron portrayed Turner as being on the &#8220;downlow.&#8221;  Anyhow, sorry for that bit of randomness.</p>

		<p>I also found alot of irony in this guy&rsquo;s rants. Anti-war blacks? Wow I never knew that all of the stories of home invasions,car jackings, shootings, rapes, aasaults, etc&hellip; those are acts of peace. No wonder blacks embrace Islam. It removes responsibility from personal acts of savagery. As far as having ID to vote, I don&rsquo;t see how that affects blacks so much. Unless you are speaking for the ones on&#8221;Cops&#8221;. But most of those guys never give their real names. But then again, most in that category can&rsquo;t vote anyway. Stop breaking the law, plain and simple. </p>

		<p>On Sirius-XM, talk radio mouth Andrew Wilkow interviewed black conservative Herman Cain.  They were both excited about the coming groundswell of pent-up black conservatives who are just waiting for a chance to vote for a black Republican.  So let me get this straight.  Given the choice between BHO and a black &#8220;conservative&#8221; businessman, we can expect a massive shift in the black vote?  Are these people high, or just stupid?  </p>
<p>It seems as if white Republicans just can&rsquo;t get over their dream of a Great Black Hope.  I swear, if MLK were still alive the Republicans would put him on the ticket, with nutjob Beck or Palin as number two, if they could.  This country is doomed.</p>

<p>For the record, I think you meant, or should have meant, &#8220;had oppressed them &hellip;&#8221;, because whites have, on the whole, tried to uplift blacks for pretty much the past 45 years. I do not consider blacks to be a presently &#8220;oppressed&#8221; group. To suggest otherwise is to take on the language and arguments of the opposition.</p>

		<p>Blacks are being &#8220;thrown under the bus&#8221; by the elite class that holds all power in this country in favor of the new &#8220;minority&#8221; Hispanics.  Even members of the CBC fight for open borders and thus black replacement by Hispanics in the job market, schools and neighborhoods. Hispanics ARE ethnically cleansing blacks from the Southwest aided and abetted by blacks&rsquo; own traitorous pols who realize that to keep the power and shopping trips they so crave they too must pander to Hispanics.  But, not to worry, soon the majority Hispanic electorate will throw the black pols under the bus as well.</p>
<p>Race trumps all, class, power, money.  Obama is too stupid to understand this but his handlers aren&rsquo;t and must send the message, even though it is a lie, that Obama is a BLACK politician FIRST and foremost and always.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that the likes of Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell and black &#8220;conservatives&#8221; of their ilk voted for Obama once they were in privacy behind the the curtain of a voting booth.</p>
<p>Blacks are no longer the favored &#8220;minority&#8221; to use against whitey.  Watch for more Democratic &#8220;solidarity&#8221; with Hispanics, lots of pandering and lots of promises for Hispanic &#8220;social justice&#8221; against &#8220;oppressive whites&#8221; once the fun beings in a few months.</p>
<p>Blacks will be forever more a footnote.</p>

<p>It is clear that this black writer believes that a black president should rule for the benefit of blacks   &mdash;   and for blacks ONLY. </p>
<p>So   &mdash;   without going into any of the other outrageous assertions and gaping holes in logic in this article   &mdash;   I would like the writer to answer this ONE question: </p>

<b>On what democratic basis should any ethnic group comprising a mere 13% of the population rule over the other 87%?</b></p>

		<p>Mr. Teas, I don&rsquo;t remember anyone mentioning &#8220;The Confessions of Nat Turner&#8221; on this board before now.  That book is race realism turned on its head!  The blacks are all intellectuals and moral paragons, while the whites are all stupid, revolting and degenerate.  You forgot to mention that Turner only loses because other black slaves fight for the whites.  Could it be meant as satire?  I once met Styron, but had not yet read the book.  If only I could have asked him.<br>
That aside, the book is remarkably well-written.  I bought it at a book sale for one or two bucks and couldn&rsquo;t put it down.  However, it is no guide to reality.  Anyone who reads it better not be impressionable.<br>
Want a realistic take on blacks?  You can&rsquo;t do better than &#8220;A Bend in the River&#8221; by Naipaul.  The Africans in there are ones that anyone here will recognize.  I don&rsquo;t think that a white man could have gotten the same book published.</p>

<p>If a fair system where &#8216;content of character&rsquo; trumped skin color, blacks who were truly brilliant enough to get into the oval office would be sponsoring programs that benefited the entire U.S. population and thus be known as _great leaders_ because their actions spoke to the sense of moral and pragmatic rectitude in all of us.</p>
<p>What you have to wonder at then is the creation of _pluralism_ as a means to garner victory by making untenable promises to &#8216;the majority of the diversity&rsquo; whose goals are antithetical or blatantly competitive with each other.</p>
<p>It is as though the political system of our country is being focused towards failure of the U.S. as a whole rather than as a secondary consequence to disempowerment of white culture in general.</p>

		<p>10 Mr. Teas:</p>
<p>That goes to show you how stupid those blacks are:</p>
<p>(1)  If your driving privileges are suspended, your drivers licenses is still valid ID for any other purpose for which you need one.  You&rsquo;re just not allowed to drive during the suspension.</p>
<p>(2)  If the cops accost you and you have no proof of ID, that plus reasonable suspicion of the person being wanted are good enough grounds to detain the person for a certain period of time, until positive identity of the person and therefore if any warrants are out on that person are ascertained.</p>

		<p>&#8221; But while black America remains the most antiwar section of the U.S. polity, black critics of the imperial wars are not heard&#8221;</p>
<p>I live right outside the gate of one of the biggest VA hospitals in the country.  If blacks are so anti military, why are virtually every VA employee but the Indian Drs and most of the vets who use the services black?  And aren&rsquo;t the enlisted people about 30 percent black, almost triple their percentage in the general population.</p>

<p>Two reasons.  The first is the military is a type of welfare for blacks.  They sign up, do none of the fighting, pull a paycheck and others do their work for them.  Affirmative action means they get promoted anyway.</p>
<p>This has little to do with the military and everything to do with the fact that our military is a socialist entity.  As opposed to being privatized.  This is supposed to protect a nation from corporatism (private armies immune to the rule of law because they simply kill anyone who dares to get in their way).  But that only works if your government is sane and just.  Ours can&rsquo;t decide.  It&rsquo;s schizophrenic.  Sometimes good, sometimes tyrannical.  Socialism is not necessarily a bad thing.  But in the west, we have institutionalized black worship (look that term up to learn A LOT about why things are done the way they are).  It is near religious dogma that blacks are oppressed and it is the responsibility  of institutions to correct that.  So&hellip;..government hiring isn&rsquo;t done on merit.  It&rsquo;s done on &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  The blacks know this and are like, woohoo, free money.  It&rsquo;s not like they have any intention to promote military success over there.  In fact, who knows how many take the opportunity to commit sabotage.</p>
<p>The other reason is large VA hospitals are in big cities.  Whites have been ethnically cleansed from big cities.  Many still work there, and millions of cars travel back and forth from the suburbs&hellip;&hellip;..while it&rsquo;s taboo to say why you can&rsquo;t just an apartment a few blocks from where you work.</p>

		<p>21 and 22:</p>
<p>If the VA hospital is in or near a city with a black population, then you can bet that almost all of the employees who aren&rsquo;t physicians are black.  The big VA Hospital in St. Louis is that way, and is in fact situated almost in St. Louis&rsquo;s ghetto.  Recently, there have been several scandals relating to unsterilized dental equipment leading to what was feared to be a massive spread of HIV/AIDS and other VDs.  The obvious but taboo reason is because of all the no-account lazy incompetent blacks that the Federal government likes to hire.  To make the situation even more deliciously ironic, the black Congressman who represents the district that VA Hospital is in is so lazy and useless that the white Congressman directly to the south was the one that spearheaded the investigation, which of course was useless because that particular white Congressman is a liberal Democrat, and therefore won&rsquo;t touch race and affirmative action.</p>

<p>Hm.  I get the impression that most of them couldn&rsquo;t care less who we&rsquo;re fighting and why, so long as the freebies keep coming in.</p>
