<h1>Man Urinated on Walgreens Cough Drops, Cops Say</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bianca Prieto, Orlando Sentinel, April 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sanford police are looking for a man who urinated on more than 100 unopened cough-drop packages at Walgreens last week.</p>
<p>The man went into the store at 2501 S. French Ave. at about 10:30 p.m. Thursday and walked to the cough-drop aisle.</p>
<p>Police say the unknown man looked around, unzipped his pants and urinated on 110 packages of cough drops.</p>
<p>Afterward he walked to the pharmacy and tried to fill a prescription, but didn&rsquo;t have the correct paperwork. He then left the store.</p>

		<p>Probably mentally ill. I used to live in a majority black city and there were a lot of borderline retarded and just plain crazy blacks wandering around the streets. Most of them were probably harmless, but you can never tell. Pathological behavior is very common at the bottom end of the bell curve, but even the most dimwitted blacks know how to play on white guilt to their advantage. They&rsquo;ll come up to you on the street and say things like &#8220;don&rsquo;t hate me because I&rsquo;m black,&#8221; then hit you up for money. This kind of scam works all the time with white liberals. I was sitting in my car in a convenience store parking lot once when an obviously retarded black stuck his head in my window and said &#8220;Did I ever tell you I hate white people?&#8221; Just like that  &mdash;  out of nowhere. I said &#8220;who gives a *****?&#8221; and his tone changed immediately. He gave me a goofy grin and said &#8220;I like YOU.&#8221; Go figure. He could just as easily have pulled out a knife and tried to kill me. The guy in this picture either didn&rsquo;t know where he was or just didn&rsquo;t care, but it would be interesting to know what the prescription he tried to fill was for. Ten to one it was some kind of antipsychotic medication.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the rationale behind this kind of behavior.  If he had to go to the bathroom he could have used the public facilities in the store or even the floor.  Why take the time to pee on some cough drops?  If it&rsquo;s about revenge, does he seriously think that a customer is going to buy something that&rsquo;s wet and smelly?  This is what you get when you close down the sanitariums and release the patients into the population.  </p>

		<p>Personal fetish?  Past grievances with an analgesic manufacturer?  How about, &#8216;Marking Territory&rsquo;?</p>
<p>No, that doesn&rsquo;t work because the bull doesn&rsquo;t look around furtively before &#8216;letting his presence be known&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re left with black sociopathy.  Destroying what they do not understand or cannot have.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sadder yet is that he cannot put 2+2 together well enough to understand that picking up a scrip is the same as giving them your identity.  And now he can never go back for whatever drug keeps him stable.</p>

		<p>Typical&hellip;.I have never in my life seen so many stories of nonwhites and their pathologies. And we just keep importing more and more of them by the millions into our country. The enemies planned agenda sure is working to destroy all semblance of civility and peace of mind that only Whites could build.</p>

		<p>This is a prime example of not just black behavior, but mentally challenged or psychologically damaged black behavior.</p>
<p>Every race has their &#8220;crazies&#8221;, but you would be shocked at how many there are among the black ranks that no one points out or just blame on whitey so blacks won&rsquo;t look as bad as a whole.</p>
<p>By white standards, a vast amount of blacks are technically mentally retarded.  Fact.</p>

		<p>To poster #3, where I&rsquo;m at, misc. blacks pop up at car windows all the time, usually out of nowhere.  The other day I was getting in my car with my kids, and as I turned to put my seat belt on on, I looked towards the window and suddenly there was a black guy in a wheelchair at me window, banging on it.  He gave me a story about needing $5 to buy some essential medicine.  I gave it to him just to get rid of him.  I don&rsquo;t patronize that shopping strip anymore.  (I learned later there are a lot of projects only a few blocks from there.)</p>

<p>There was a black suspect on awaiting bond motion that got left in a holding room in Illinois - Dupage County I think - that had his whole family bitching after he had to pee his pants.  While he was in the holding room he managed to get the handcuffs from behind his back to the front, there was a garbage can in the room, he was not handcuffed to the table, yet he had to sit in the chair he was told to sit in and piss him self and sit in it all night. Gimmee a break. He was sueing the last I heard. They never report the results if they are unsuccessful though &hellip;</p>

		<p>  Maybe he couldn&rsquo;t &#8220;hold it&#8221; and thought that the mess would be better for clean up if he wet the coughdrops? ;) All that Eucalyptus, Menthol, or Cherry smell would mask his territoriality!  LOL  ;)</p>

The WORST place to be for an assault is sitting in a parked car with a potential assailant at the window..
