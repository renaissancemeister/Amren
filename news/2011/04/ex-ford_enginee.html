<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Chinese engineer who stole Ford Motor Co trade secrets was sentenced to almost six years in prison, said the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office in Detroit.</p>
<p>Xiang Dong Yu, also known as Mike Yu, of Beijing, was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison and ordered to pay a fine of $12,500 after pleading guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yu, 49, was arrested in October 2009 when he arrived at Chicago&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hare International Airport from China on charges that he stole thousands of secret documents detailing Ford designs worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In December 2006, he accepted a job at the China branch of a U.S. company, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office said. On the eve of his departure from Ford and before he told the automaker of his new job, Yu copied some 4,000 Ford documents onto an external hard drive, including sensitive Ford design documents about engine-transmission and electric power supply systems, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s office said.</p>

		<p>This guy did exactly what we would expect him to do.  That is, we expect people to support their relatives over non-relatives, and their ethnic group over foreign people.   People will even die for their relatives and their own kind.  </p>
<p>This is also why it is insane to import millions of foreigners into your homeland, especially for H1B High-tec jobs   &mdash;   such foreigners often keep their allegiance to their home country.  This is proven by the hundreds of cases of industrial espionage conducted by foreigners, and the many acts of terrorism committed in the USA by recent immigrants.  </p>
<p>However, leftists (and our politicians) believe that the second foreigners steps onto American soil, they immediately abandon love of their own kind and their old country.  Let me ask you: if you stepped onto Iranian soil or Chinese soil, would you immediately favor Iranians or Chinese against Americans?  Why would we expect foreigners to be different?<br>

		<p>2 Anon: Leftists (and politicians) know that the foreigners are not loyal to this country, even if they become naturalized citizens.  The leftists hate this country more than most foreigners do, and the politicians don&rsquo;t care as long as their bribes and benefits roll in.  </p>

		<p>A major cause of the continuing decline of America was liberal&rsquo;s need to &#8220;save&#8221; Third World peoples. This includes: (1) foreign aid projects to teach foreigners how to effectively compete with us.  (2) Outright transfer of our leading-edge technology, such as hybrid plants and modern agricultural and industrial technology, and building factories overseas. (3) Educating the world in our top universities, including schools of engineering.  (4) The H1-B Program, which allows foreigners to acquire our most sensitive technology and manufacturing techniques, and then return home with that knowledge.</p>
<p>The result should surprise no one: Brazil and Mexico now out-compete us in agriculture, and China and India, can now out-compete us in industry.  What is left for Americans?  Working for the government, fast-food joints, and giant mega discount stores (stocked with cheap Chinese junk), and paying taxes.  </p>
<p>Your children and grandchildren will not have jobs.  Our government has given away our hard-won technology to 3 Billion foreigners who will work for $1/hr.  Can your children compete with that?  Of course not.  The traitorous One-Worlders have finally gotten their wish – we will finally all be the same &hellip; in misery and poverty.<br>

		<p>Large global American corporations made a business decision:</p>
<p>Higher cheap Chinese engineers, use cheap Chinese labor, attempt to market products in China which already has more cars than their infrastructure can support.</p>
<p>For these benefits they give up some things: Give up engineering and management technologies to China, give up 60 years of experience and learning to Chinese, the need to compete thanks to arbitrage.</p>
<p>On many website we see frustration and despair over growing Black, Hispanic, Chinese, and Jewish influence, success and prosperity. But the truth is: The White Ruling Elite who run our American Global corporations and the US government sold the average American out to build empires and increase short term profits. All racial and ethic groups only took advantage of what the American government and White Elite gave to them. </p>
<p>Our biggest enemy of the West and American Whites are our government and corporations that make and buy the best laws and policies that allow them to sell us out.</p>
<p>Until the White Ruling Elite start to think about the West first, America first, their fellow men first, we will continue to decline and the West will continue to degrade itself through entertainment, obedience to corporate and government enforced political correctness and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Complain all we want: Whites put President Obama in office. Whites promoted affirmative action. Whites promoted Globalisation. Whites promoted the new Afro-centric and Latino-centric culture and lifestyle that is in our face every day.</p>
<p>Some bad mouth China content at Walmart, but Walmart actually is one of the few companies that passes to the consumer China prices, in spite of the fact that the same factories and sister companies produce the products exported to the US for Target, K-Mart, Sears, JC Penny, etc etc etc..   </p>
<p>When you wear your running shoes remember two companies produce almost all major brands of running shoes in Asia for US brands.</p>
<p>When you enjoy your Mac remember it is produced in a Taiwanese owned factory in China.</p>
<p>When you use your computer remember a Taiwanese factory owned factory in China and Asia produced those computers.</p>
<p>Because American Corporations are about branding and marketing, not manufacturing. They lower their risk at the expense of American jobs and the associated headaches.</p>
<p>Yes, China makes a lot of junk, but they also make a lot of good stuff too. Thanks to American Global corporations who gave them technology, standards, management techniques, and modern thinking.</p>
<p>It is not that China is on the rise, but that the West and America is in decline not only materially, but spiritually and mentally.</p>
<p>The leaders in the White Ruling Elite have residences all around the world and have no loyalty to any country or race. They will simply relocate where it is convenient with no attachment whatsoever to their race, culture, or home country.</p>
<p>This Ford engineer was just stupid. Thousands of foreigners working in American companies are transferring technology and know how out of America and the West and nobody is saying a word. What took the West and America 100 years to develop is being given away to China. And they are gladly accepting and using the same against us.</p>
<p>America has not partnerships, no loyalty from foreign business.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget who sold us out, and don&rsquo;t blame the Chinese for what was given to them by OUR LEADERSHIP.</p>

<p>At that rate, it is very profitable for the Chinese to continue their espionage.  They probably have thousand like Yu implanted here, and if an occasional one gets caught &hellip; oh, well, that&rsquo;s just the chance you take.  Tut, tut.</p>

<p></p>
<p> Absolutely! Did this all begin back there with the Peace Corps? &hellip; this obsession with doing good for the third world and  uplifting the backward, &#8220;oppressed peoples&#8221; of the earth?   (Remember Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s mother (Miz Lilian) trecking off to India? Remember the Beetles and their obsession with India and bare feet and gurus?)   Somewhere, the idea took root and it&rsquo;s still very much in vogue  among lefties today.</p>
<p>In fact, back in the 19th century, this  sort of thing used to be what missionaries did   &mdash;   going off to   to Africa or China to save  &#8220;the heathen&#8221; by bringing them the benefits of Christianity.  Now, Christianity is out of favor with the trendy Left, and the those peoples are no longer referred to as &#8220;heathen&#8221; (very un-politically correct!&hellip;it might offend someone), and our zealous missionary types no longer bring them bibles but economic aid and schemes for women&rsquo;s empowerment. All in style with the times.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all the damaging evidence that&rsquo;s flowing back in, our  trendy leftists still hold to their dogmatic beliefs with a kind of religious intensity   &mdash;   just like those 19th century missionaries. We must uplift the backward of the earth!  We must take what we have  (especially what YOU have, White Man)  and give it to them!  We are wicked sinners for having so much while  they have so little! Shame on us.  It is our fault that they are poor! We must bring them HERE to share our lifestyle and our country! We must make them citizens; we must have them vote!  Only then will we have Paradise on earth.</p>
<p>Day after day, and year after year, we&rsquo;ve been reading articles like this.  This alien subversion is nothing new!   How long can America can continue to sustain this undermining, this deadly assault, before we collapse?</p>
<p>And yes, as others have pointed out, NONE  of this could be happening without our permission.  It is the starry-eyed fools among us who make it possible.</p>
<p>I fear that we Americans  (and Europeans too) will not begin to look out for ourselves (as others instinctively do) until we have nothing left to look out for.  That is, when we are reduced to the same level of misery and wretchedness as the third world. (And only then will the third world invasion stop.) Our curse has been our prosperity, temporary as that will prove to have been.</p>
<p>Only starving dogs will snarl and fight to the death over a bone; rich dogs will just go get another.<br>

		<p>Difficult one, this industrial espionage. Someone showed me an excerpt from a German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung 25.6.1999 how primarily the Americans are sniffling out German trade secrets by the millions by means of the &#8216;Echelon&rsquo; system which has obtained a new role as an economic espionage system after the Cold War.</p>
<p>On browsing the web it seems that in the meantime Russia and China has also gained some prominence in this respect. In reality it seems that the whole world is trying to pry out each others trade and patent secrets. </p>

		<p>The day is coming when these alien invaders will be packed up and shipped back from whence they came. As an extra &#8220;diversity bonus&#8221; to the third-world cesspits, we will include a liberal (bwahaha:) amount of white race-traitors and their facilitators to enjoy an uncertain fate. The bosses will face trial and punishment for their treachery. The reckoning will be sweet.   </p>

<p>&#8220;Sherwood Smith: please explain to me how our leadership twisted the arms of the Chinese into taking our factories and lending us money. The fact is &ldquo;our leadership&rdquo; consists of America-hating pawns who are being manipulated by the Chinese&hellip;so yes, I DO blame the Chinese for willfully destroying us through corruption and deceit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corruption and deceit of China is a separate issue from the selling out of White Americas by the White Ruling Elite and our government.- Our Leaders.</p>
<p>Until Americans stop the blame game and accept responsibility for being greedy, weak minded, and making profits at any cost China, Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Jews, or whatever, will continue to make gains and increase control over American Whites.</p>
<p>Global American Corporations in the shoe, electronics and automotive business came to China to increase profit margins due to the lower cost of doing business in China. Government regulations, tax laws, helped these Global businesses. For the most part, the Chinese economic miracle was created not so much by Chinese leadership, but by Taiwanese owned businesses in China, Joint Venture businesses with Chinese, and a Chinese government who was doing what was best for China.</p>
<p>For the most part, Taiwanese own the most important businesses for transferring technology and know how to China: Foxconn in electronics, PouChen in electronics, Dean Shoes and YY Group in shoes, etc etc.  The mainland Chinese companies did not have the technology or know how until these Taiwanese companies opened the doors for ALL the major American Brands.</p>
<p>American companies created Joint Venture companies with the Taiwanese and Chinese SOE. A clever part of the Joint Ventures was the sharing and transferring of technologies with the Joint Venture partners: America companies jumped at the chance to increase margins through arbitrage. </p>
<p>Now after many years what do we see:</p>
<p>1-Americans blame the Chinese for ending up with what looks like the better end of the deal.<br>
2- The White Ruling Elite who run American have escaped with almost no criticism for transferring technology, jobs and know how to China.<br>
3- Almost no one appreciates the Taiwanese contribution to the China economic miracle.<br>
4- The media bashes China along with the ignorant when in fact China is China, and acting as any group would except White Americans because the White Ruling Elite duped the masses into believing that money, stock options, and profit margins are the only important thing.</p>
<p>Yes China is very corrupt, but for the most part the real reason so many are angry after the fact at the Chinese is because they ended up simply doing a better job of negotiating the best terms for China. The White Ruling Elite did not negotiate what was best for America but what was best for their stock options, short term profits, and short term cost reductions, etc.</p>
<p>The Chinese will never be like the West though they imitate us in many ways: girls want to look like white girls, boys dress american styles, success is measured by American movies, hair color, car styles, etc etc.  A small insignificant number of Chinese who are so called American does not matter when you look at the huge number of Chinese around the world who ARE NOT assimilated and have no desire. They only want the material parts of the West.. nothing else.</p>
<p>Our leadership in American at every level sold us out. Don&rsquo;t ever think that our White Leadership is not a bunch of schemers just like the Chinese leadership. They are just more sophisticated AND have the media to promote anti-Chinese sentiment while they do their dirty work and sell me and you out.</p>
<p>Every American Corporation operating in China from day one knows exactly what is going on in China, but they continued to do business there. Because profits were easier. American businesses agreed to technology transfers to Taiwanese and Chinese businesses in China, and considered it a part of doing business in China.</p>
<p>Stop your complaining, our leadership considered the consequences of doing business in China an acceptable risk, at the cost of American middle class and American culture. Stop trying to justify the White Ruling Elite who destroyed America. Stop blaming the Chinese leadership for doing what American Leadership should have been doing but did not: Looking out for the interest of American Whites and American Culture.</p>
<p>The same American Leadership that willfully transferred our jobs and technology to China, is the same people who promoted, financed, and made PC, multi-culturalism, and affirmative action law and acceptable thinking.</p>
<p>When we focus on WHO really sold us out, THEN maybe energy will be focused on where change needs to be made instead of bashing people who are simply doing business with the American Elite.</p>
<p>China has many growing problems that gobs of US dollars will not fix. They need us much more than we need them.</p>

		<p>As a former white IT worker who was run out of Silicon Valley by the Indians and Chinese, I can tell you this goes on in nearly every company today. I&rsquo;ll never forget the &#8220;highly-skilled&#8221; QA Manager from china, who in 2004 brought me into a conference room at work, sat me down with a newly imported QA worker from India, looked me right in the eye and said &#8220;OUR GOAL IS TO EXTRACT YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND GIVE IT TO  HERE!&#8221;. After I looked at him for a few seconds he calmed down and said &#8220;My goal is to really understand the process here&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>Ooops, let the cat out of the bag, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Sometimes they just can&rsquo;t help themselves: America&rsquo;s industries are being stolen from us right under our noses by faking frauds who come here to get TRAINED by us.</p>

		<p>It worries me when people have this blase attitude of allowing Chinese such access to the West, because they are clever or have low crime rates or whatever. They really are not so benign. And it&rsquo;s much worse for Western companies who decided to go on the China manufacturing route. Imagine if Chinese companies doing business in the US had to experience this:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/kTfak" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/kTfak</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something foreign companies in China have to deal with on a regular basis. </p>

		<p>#12 Smith:  &#8220;China has many growing problems that gobs of US dollars will not fix. They need us much more than we need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree.  </p>
<p>People seem to think that China is a giant semi-tractor/trailer roaring down the economic highway crushing everything in its path, but the truth of the matter is that China might be a big road rig, but it is puttering along on a non-paved road filled with pot holes.  The country could better be described as a house of cards, both economically and socially.</p>
<p>An economic disaster for Europe and the US will create ungodly problems for China.  They have well-over a billion mouths to feed and water, and the resulting chaos caused by a severe cutback in global imports could well set those in that heavily over-populated country against each other, and the government, in mass riots. The same will happen in India and Pakistan, Indonesia, etc. </p>
<p>Inflation&hellip;the product of hard economic times and the ongoing &#8220;quantatative easing&#8221; by the West&hellip;.will cause food prices to skyrocket beyond the means of most ALL third world citizens.  The eruptions in the Middle East are giving us daily examples of what just a slight rise in food prices will cause.  Democracy has nothing to do with the situations.  People can&rsquo;t feed themselves on 2 to 5 dollars per day at current food prices. They will be faced with the option of starving or rioting WHEN prices increase even further as they surely will.  </p>
<p>Too, in China, each corporate structure, mostly, is an entity in itself that boards its employees in corporate housing like worker ants to be exploited to the fullest in order to maintain a consistent output of goods for the world market.  An economic downturn would cause these workers to be idled.    Hungry, non-working citizens are the stuff revolutions are made of.  Kind of like the coal mines in latter day America where the big shots owned the stores, housing and shops.  </p>
<p>So, if China were really smart, it would be concentrating on self-sufficiency so as not to be effected so greatly by the global economic system, rather than concentrating on stealing government and trade secrets as if the only concern in this volatile situation&hellip;. that will be with us for quite a long time&hellip;.is competing for products and weapons.  They&rsquo;re trying to expand in Africa and other areas, making them de facto Chinese supply farms, but they&rsquo;re not doing very well right now, thinking, I&rsquo;m sure, that prosperity for them will be on the upswing forever.</p>
<p>When the West falls, the entire world will fall with it.  And, when it does, so too will the diversitoids, and the whole world will know that isolationism is INDEED the best policy.</p>

		<p>Post # 13: &#8221; America&rsquo;s industries are being stolen from us right under our noses by faking frauds who come here to get TRAINED by us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is worse than that.  At virtually every public university, foreigners can receive a technical/scientific/agricultural education for far below its actual cost, because public universities are funded by tax payers.  The entire vast sum of our nation&rsquo;s scientific and technical knowledge is available for virtually free.  Taxpayers are paying to train foreigners to out-compete us.  At my university, over half of the science graduate students are foreign.  Virtually all have either research or teaching assistantships (paid by taxpayers).  The result is China, India, &amp; Brazil surge ahead, while Americans are cluless as to why their standard of living is declining and their children cannot find jobs.  Americans are paying for thier own demise.</p>

		<p>Stop your complaining!  Our leadership considered the consequences of doing business in China an acceptable risk, at the expense  of the American middle class and American culture. </p>
<p>Stop trying to justify the White Ruling Elite who destroyed America. Stop blaming the Chinese leadership for doing what American Leadership SHOULD have been doing, but did not: Looking out for the interests of America.</p>
<p>That same American Leadership who willfully transferred our jobs and technology to China are  the same people who promoted, financed, and made political correctness, multi-culturalism, and affirmative action into law and acceptable thinking.</p>

<p>Wow! That&rsquo;s telling it like it is.  Great post from Sherwood Smith.  I agree with every word.  Many thanks.  </p>
<p>As has been said here many times by others, our worst enemies are among us. None of this could be happening without their connivance and collaboration.</p>
