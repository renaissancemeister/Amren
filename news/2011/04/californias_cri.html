<h1>California&rsquo;s Criminal Alien Population Rises</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sacramento Bee, April 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of criminal aliens incarcerated in California rose to 102,795 in 2009, a 17 percent increase since 2003, federal auditors reported Thursday.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t cheap. Nationwide, the Government Accountability Office reports, it costs well over $1.1 billion a year for states to imprison criminal aliens  &mdash;  those who committed a crime after entering the United States illegally. California, moreover, is more expensive than other states. GAO auditors estimated California spends $34,000 to incarcerate a criminal alien for one year; in Texas, it&rsquo;s only $12,000.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than one in four of the illegal immigrants imprisoned in California are behind bars for drug offenses. Many are also repeat offenders. GAO auditors say that, based on a survey, criminal alien inmates have been arrested an average of seven different times.</p>

		<p>But this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that California is going bankrupt, that the USA is going bankrupt, taht taxes are going up, that inflation is increasing, and that millions of European Americans have fled California, which was once one of the most coveted pieces of real estate on Earth, and which once had the best standard of living and life-style.</p>

<p>Most of those illegals are in prison for more than just mere &#8220;drug offenses&#8221; as the want us to believe. They commit rapes, they are child molesters, murders, gang crimes, take over our National Parks as one big cartel POT farm, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>NOTHING will ever be done about these illegals either by the libs or the neocons, except to legalize them all so they can bring in millions more of their family members and gang bangers.</p>

		<p>In my few, and getting fewer, visits back home from here in Afghanistan, I notice a LOT of Whites doing business &#8220;under the table&#8221; and bartering. SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;.that the federal government is going to start cracking down on this sort of thing, but only because it is mostly Whites doing it as blacks have little in the way of bartering skills or talents since being able to play BLACKSETball is not a skill many White people will need in the coming road warrior days ahead.</p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>If there are 100,000+ illegals in prisons in CA at $34K/per, then CA alone is paying nearly $3.5 billion.  Nationwide I&rsquo;m sure the US taxpayer is forking out over $10B to enjoy diversity that our open borders bring.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Immigration benefits California&rsquo; - How many times have we heard that before?<br>
California is in very dire financial straits at present.Just imagine the fillip of the saved cost of incarcerating 100,000 prisoners would give the state.</p>

		<p>Yes, most of these criminals are in prison for drug offenses, and Question Diversity is right (as usual) that the charge was pled down to this.  The reason is that all the other crimes they commit involve victims, and you need victim testimony to get a conviction.  These criminals are ALL gang members, and it is very unhealthy to testify against a gang member.  Drug charges require no victim and no victim testimony, ergo sum, they are imprisoned for drug charges.</p>

		<p>Since Diversity is a Nation&rsquo;s Greatest Strength, let&rsquo;s help Mexico by sending it some of our Diversity.  We can start by returning Mexicans in USA prisons back to Mexico.  I know, I know, this could harm our economy, by reducing our wonderful multicultural workforce in a Global Environment, meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century.  However, we shouldn&rsquo;t be selfish: we need to think of others for a change.  We need to help Mexico.  </p>

		<p>What a colossal waste of manpower&hellip;if each inmate was required to vigorously ride a stationary bike for a few hours a day, hooked up to a power-generating sytstem, California would be energy-independent! Instead these bangers hang around lifting weights, making shanks, raping each other, and burdening taxpayers. But this would probably violate their rights&hellip;</p>

		<p>7 Old Soldier:</p>
<p>About once or twice a year here on AR, there is a story about a &#8220;report&#8221; put out by some liberal &#8220;think&#8221; tank that whines about how black men and/or Hispanic men get so much tougher and longer prison bids for &#8220;drug crimes&#8221; than white men.  </p>
<p>You just provided the answer - A lot of blacks and Hispanics are &#8220;officially&#8221; convicted of a drug crime as part of a plea deal, knocking off a lot of their charges where a human victim must testify, in exchange for a long bid on the &#8220;drug&#8221; charge, on the top end of what is legally permissible for that &#8220;drug&#8221; charge.</p>
<p>The other answer is that not all drug charges are the same.  Getting caught with a little bit of weed as your very first crime is a &#8220;drug crime,&#8221; and getting popped for the 8th time for dealing crack to teenagers is also a &#8220;drug crime.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s just that the latter drug crime is way more serious than the former.  Get the picture?  I know we all do.</p>

		<p>As usual the Tea Party &#8220;Republicans&#8221; aka: neocons) haven&rsquo;t done a darn thing about illegal immigration except mouth a bunch of nonsense. Notice the Tea Partiers NEVER condemn 3RD world legal immigration period. They just want all to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; and follow &#8220;our&#8221; laws&hellip;&hellip;They are all cowards. They even have 2 blacks on their list to run for the POTUS. Can&rsquo;t be &#8220;racists, now can we?  They are no better than the left.</p>
<p>One would do well to NEVER vote for the Dems or the Repubs and tell them WHY you will not.</p>

		<p>Just as I say it in post 10 reacting to Old Soldier at 7, it&rsquo;s newsworthy again:</p>

<p>Second City Cop responds:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/FxSX1" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/FxSX1</a></p>
<p>One of the people at SCC says that &#8220;You can not go around locking up whites for no reason just to even out the stats.&#8221;  I disagree, unfortunately.  While you can&rsquo;t do that in theory, you can move the goalposts around depending on which race has the ball.  What I mean by that is that to fend off liberal complaining and lawsuits, you can lock up a white man for any ticky-tack offense, while giving non-whites a pass on all but the most serious offenses, &#8220;just to even out the stats.&#8221;  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find out that that kind of thing is happening in a city as liberal and full of civil rights loudmouths like Chicago.  While the percentage of whites in the Crook County Jail are small, I bet most of them are in there on average for far less serious offenses than the blacks and Hispanics who are raping them.</p>

		<p>And we have these dog and pony shows about budget cuts?<br>
(Yes, the worst is probably our insane foreign wars, and the obscene military - industrial complex), but, consider these gravy trains that illegals feed: </p>
<p>cheap labor at Chipotle, and ten thousand other corporate rat&rsquo;s nests.</p>
<p>Lots of social bureaucracies and millions of individual salaries.</p>
<p>Church tithes. Churches gotta&rsquo; get that money!</p>
<p>The Prison industry; if there&rsquo;s money in it, it cannot be killed, or even reduced.<br>
There are billions, if not trillions  of dollars in salaries, pensions, pension funds, construction contracts, ad nauseam in this industry. The more inmates, the merrier.</p>
<p>Policing: the more crime on the streets, the more need for cops. It&rsquo;s so obvious, its almost funny: let the illegals stay and raise hell; cops will let them go for all else but very serious felonies. Keeps the need high. Those cruisers probably cost north of 100 grand a pop, and cops get paid well (no begrudging that).</p>
<p>Education: the dumber and more foreign the students, the more they fail. The more they fail, the more money MUST be thrown at them. The programs are as endless as the imagination.</p>
<p>I could go on and on.</p>
<p>Please think about it&hellip;all these points are so easily blown off by a rationalization or two. But who can deny that where the money is, where the salaries and the investments are, that&rsquo;s what you can&rsquo;t uproot&hellip;real people actually depend on this stuff.<br>
Sad. True.</p>

		<p> And yet I heard New York City Mayor Bloomberg advocate increased immigration and amnesty this weekend on Fox. Legal and illegal immigration has really been good for California  &mdash;  good for bankrupting the State and for massive white flight from the former Golden State. </p>

		<p>The Mexican government likes to blame American consumer demand for the whole drug cartel problem.  Given that American dollars are supporting the drug trade, it would be totally appropriate for the Mexican government to foot the bill for incarcerating their citizen outlaws in our prisons.  While we&rsquo;re at it, Mexico should reinburse us for educating, medicating and generally providing for the general welfare of their citizens.  If we can bring down and rebuild countries the size of Iraq over &#8220;possible&#8221; threat, we could surely bring down this third-world narco state that is deffinately not just a threat, but a destructive force.</p>
