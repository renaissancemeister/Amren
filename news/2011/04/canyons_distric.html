<h1><a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=15069136">Canyons District Announces Plans to Combat Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KSL-TV (Salt Lake City), April 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After completing an investigation into an alleged racial incident at Alta High School last month and uncovering other &#8220;serious incidents,&#8221; the Canyons School District has outlined action it will take to prevent that behavior in the future.</p>
<p>But an official statement Friday, which detailed the chronology of the incident that precipitated the district probe, offered no new information on the nature of the other alleged episodes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did uncover allegations or evidence of other serious incidents,&#8221; said David S. Doty, Canyons School District Superintendent. &#8220;They were serious enough that we felt it warranted further investigation by law enforcement.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The investigation was prompted by an incident at a March 17 Spirit Bowl event where a junior student dressed in white  &mdash;  his class color  &mdash;  donned a white pillow case with holes cut out of it in an effort to taunt the senior class. Some thought his outfit resembled Ku Klux Klan attire.</p>
<p>The district launched an investigation that included intervention by the U.S. Department of Justice and placed placed the school&rsquo;s principal Mont Widerberg and vice principal Mark Montague on paid leave pending the investigation&rsquo;s outcome.</p>
<p>Three students were cited with misdemeanor unlawful acts at school for the Spirit Bowl incident and Sandy police said two of the students were also cited for allegedly texting an image of a burning cross and a Klansman superimposed with the phrase &#8220;Alta Pride.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I think what we have at Alta is the actions of a few that need to be eradicated root and branch and I&rsquo;m committed to see that done,&#8221; Doty said. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a result of the incident, the district announced it would now provide education and training in all Canyons schools on issues related to diversity and nondiscrimination. The efforts could involve resources and assistance from outside organizations including the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the First Amendment Center, the Utah 3Rs Project, the Utah State Office of Education, the Utah Inclusion Center and the Human Rights Education Center of Utah.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, the district said it would create a Civility Commission comprised of parents, students, employees and community members from diverse backgrounds. The commission will aid in the district&rsquo;s efforts to &#8220;foster a climate of respect, tolerance, and civility in Canyons schools and the broader community to which they connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone&rsquo;s responsible for resolving it,&#8221; Doty said. &#8220;I refuse to be the superintendent of a school that allows that kind of behavior to go on.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Furthermore, the district will also conduct a comprehensive review of all of its federal Safe Schools and nondiscrimination policies to ensure that they are clear, strong and well communicated, the statement said.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it:  &#8220;fighting racism&#8221;  has become a mania, an obsession. It is the new &#8220;religion&#8221; of our time. Everything must bow before it. And doubters are the new heretics who mjust be persecuted.</p>
<p>There have been other examples of mass hysteria  like this, throughout history   &mdash;   like the tulip mania in Holland where fortunes were gambled and lost on a single tulip bulb.</p>
<p>But eventually people wake up.  They have to. After this &#8220;fighting racism&#8221; mania  has passed, what will be next?</p>
<p>Some (many) people need a sense of purpose in life, some cause higher than themselves. &#8220;Fighting racism&#8221; makes them feel noble, virtuous, and important. It makes them feel better than others.</p>
<p>But how can they fight what are in fact their own people&rsquo;s interests?  Are humans really a rational species?</p>

		<p>Utah???  These kids are Mormon - and until recently (a certain bishop had a &#8220;revelation&#8221; with regard to this, in the usual timely political fashion) blacks weren&rsquo;t allowed to enter the temple or be bishops in the Mormon Church.  It&rsquo;s kind of like when LDS bought out Coca-Cola - the bishop had a sudden revelation that it was OK for Mormons to drink caffeine (Coke has caffeine&hellip;.)  So, now the school superintendent has a revelation that racism has to go in his district?  Kind of PC and timely, is it not?  Well, like church, like school, I suppose&hellip;  Follow the yellow brick elder..</p>

<p>I would love to know more about these investigators, and especially these &#8220;serious incidents&#8221;.  Did another blonde girl turn down a nonwhite for a date?</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of the incident, the district announced it would now provide education and training in all Canyons schools on issues related to diversity and nondiscrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great idea.  I mean, its never worked in past, not one time.  But I have a good feeling about this one.</p>

		<p>Rational thinking and long range planning are not activities at which Blacks excel. But the reaction of Whites to an incident which at most required medium disciplining of the three students, is more irrational and inane than any black behaviour that I know of. Consider that this is Utah, not California, Massachusetts, or Washington. Utah is supposedly a bastion of traditional american values. If so Americans values insanity.</p>

		<p>This diversity education is only the leftist liberal version of reality. They never represent the views of our side. Everyone agrees a problem situation has happened, but the diversity educators appropriate all the explanations for themselves. Our side has a coherent and honest platform. In no way should we be ignored. We should have equal time in front of students.</p>

		<p>Black-on-White violence is common in almost all integrated schools. No one seems to care.</p>
<p>But allow one student to show up in a sheet (or tie a noose as in Jena), and authorities become gravely concerned with racism.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the authorities are not fighting racism; they are encouraging Black-on-White racism. </p>

		<p>Utah has one of the lowest black populations in the country. White parents should be up in arms over having their children indoctrinated by NAACP,SPLC,and the like. Hopefully most of the White students will resent the diversity propaganda and walk away even more strident in their beliefs.</p>

<p>Anyone seeking a truly disconcerting experience is invited to intersperse the reading of any novel in H.A. Covington&rsquo;s &ldquo;Northwest Quartet&rdquo; with a perusal of the news. we are living the nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable&rdquo; - John F. Kennedy<br>

<p>The same JFK that wrote this book &#8220;A Nation Of Immigrants&#8221;?  Spare me. Yep, the Kennedy&rsquo;s sure were the White man&rsquo;s saviour, right?</p>
<p><br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when the issue of immigration and immigrants has taken center stage in this country, the message of President John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s classic essay A Nation of Immigrants is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago.  That is why the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and publisher Harper Perennial have reissued this landmark essay on the contribution of immigrants to American society.<br>
Written by Kennedy in 1958 after ADL reached out to the then-junior senator from Massachusetts asking him to highlight the contribution of immigrants at a time when the country was locked in a debate about the direction its policy should take, it is the last manuscript President Kennedy ever wrote, and the book was first published posthumously.&#8221;<br>

		<p>When Jay Leno first took over &#8220;The Tonight Show&#8221;, he had a black bandleader who played the sax. I forget the guy&rsquo;s name, but one time the show aired on Halloween and all members of the band were dressed in different costumes, and the black bandleader was dressed like a K member, hood and all. I kid you not. Was there any outcry? Hell, no. Can you imagine what would have happened if the bandleader had been white? Talk about protests.</p>

		<p>James Edwards has done yeoman&rsquo;s work exposing this non-story for what it is.  Almost all of the school&rsquo;s students, black, white and otherwise, have said over and over that this pillowcase incident was nothing more than an adolescent prank.</p>
<p>With the SPLC and NAACP getting involved, you can bet money is a motive, that they&rsquo;re trying to gin up a non-issue into an issue in order to make money.  When public &#8220;human rights&#8221; agencies are getting involved, money is also the motive, but in a different way   &mdash;   Utah, like most other states, is facing budget issues.  I&rsquo;m sure the human rights goofballs mooching off the public dime are worried that the politicians might get the bright idea that repairing roads is better than funding human rights politburos in a recession.  It&rsquo;s just a lame attempt to justify their existence and budget.</p>

<p>You mean this isn&rsquo;t a joke, a prank or a farce?  The government REALLY plans to investigate a high school incident this down to the nth degree?  The DOJ has nothing better than to investigate a bunch of silly, immature high school students?</p>
<p>The government plans to spend untold money on THIS?</p>
<p>Yes, you stupid kulaks! Your government hates you and considers your white life worthless.  Only noble blacks and browns are worth defending.</p>

		<p>Send every student to diversity classes. Forget English, Math, or science.Nothing could be better for Utahan nationalists. Diversity trainning if compulsory is like going to prison. All you learn is how to eat with a spoon, drink a lot of water and hate blacks, gays, Mexicans, red Necks,Jews, and just about everybody. I was forced by the powers that be to go to sensitivity training after I called a woman lawyer who had just told the press that I had lied in court the day earlier a dickless Tracey wannabee and also delicately stated that if she had a set of cods which was a distinct possibility I would kick them out her mouth. Although this happened at the bar two hours into happy hour,they still came after me. What effect do you think that sensitivity training had on yours truely? <br>

<p><br>
Probably true. And yet these same authorities believe the party line somewhere between &#8216;only whites can be racist&rsquo; and &#8216;whites and their white societies are racist&rsquo;. They believe it and teach it or they bow down to it. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like they are really fighting racism but teaching it. You&rsquo;d think those who study racism as a profession might at least notice.  <br>

		<p>I sent an article about this incident to AmRen a few weeks ago and it is nice to see it published.  I completely agree with AWG.  The white kids here in Utah are typically the victims when it comes to teen stabbings (not uncommon, sadly).  As usual, a black or poly from the west side of town is always behind it.  Parents on the west side, however, just deal with it.  On the east side of Salt Lake however, the liberals rule and, hence, the overreaction in the Canyons School District.  <br>
In addition to the state&rsquo;s population being overwhelmingly Mormon, a speaker at BYU recently told his audience that all member of the church should join/support the ACLU to protect their religious freedoms.  Totally asinine.</p>
