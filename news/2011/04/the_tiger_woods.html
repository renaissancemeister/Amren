<h1>The Tiger Woods Effect Still Isn&rsquo;t Seen at the PGA Tour Level</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Steele, AOL Sporting News, April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It might be the strangest paradox in all of sports today, and it played out again last weekend at Augusta National, before millions of television viewers. Tiger Woods was the center of attention, the most magnetic presence in golf, drawing the biggest and loudest gallery and generating another massive audience for a nail-biter of a Masters finish.</p>
<p>The crowd following him was a cross-section of the global population, awash in more colors than the crowds at a major had ever been before he burst onto the scene. Undoubtedly there were more viewers of color in the United States and around the world than there ever had been before his arrival. And blended in with the mass of players tangling with Tiger for the Masters title down the stretch were youngsters from all over the planet, from literally every golf-playing continent, who readily admit that he was a major reason they took up the game and who used him as their role model.</p>
<p>Yet, once again, not a single other competitor at this major looked like Tiger.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after Woods knocked down the walls between the historically exclusionary sport and the people it most aggressively excluded, there is precisely one other African-American player on the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Now, the environment has changed in just about every other aspect of golf. More black people are playing the game; before Woods turned pro, estimates put the number of African-American recreational golfers at around 800,000, and today it is more than 2 million. More are watching it, both on television and in person. A huge segment of the conversation about Tiger&rsquo;s extra-curricular activities after his 2009 car crash was driven by a demographic that, until his emergence, couldn&rsquo;t have cared less about any aspect of any golfer&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Yet virtually none of them are joining Tiger in playing golf at its highest level.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The number of black golfers&rsquo; organizations, websites and networks grows every year. The same goes for blacks playing in college  &mdash;  including historically black colleges, even in the face of severe financial hardships at those schools. Shasta Averyhardt, who made this year&rsquo;s LPGA Tour out of Q-school, is a product of Jackson State, coached since 1986 by Eddie Payton, the brother of football Hall of Famer Walter Payton. Yes, she is the only black player on that tour.</p>
<p>All of this proves that black people in this country are engaged in golf like they never have been before. The &#8220;Tiger Effect,&#8221; a phenomenon even before he gave its generation its Jackie Robinson moment at the &#8216;97 Masters, is still in effect today. It&rsquo;s the same in tennis, where Serena and Venus Williams have drawn African-Americans into that country-club sport in unprecedented numbers during their decade-long primes.</p>

		<p>I disagree.  There are a lot of good young golfers on tour who got into golf because they were little children watching Tiger Woods dominate the sport in the 1997-2009 time frame.  They just so happen to be all white, save the occasional Oriental or Pacific Islander here and there.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m very much enjoying Tiger Woods&rsquo; symbolic fall from grace.<br>
Namely because his image as a ethnic pioneer in this sport has been so manipulated as to make him appear to be so wholesome and clean cut. <br>
When in reality this guy is a major sleaze bag, not some vulnerable soul.</p>
<p>Even now after having the audacity to cheat on your Swedish, ex swimsuit model and twin (could you think up a better sexiness cliché?), who was his wife and the mother of his children with up to 120 cheap hookers, porn stars and waitresses etc. <br>
When I look at Woods, I see a Dennis Rodman type of character with all of his &ldquo;bling and ho&rsquo;s&rdquo; being simply kept out of sight.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember Woods has and is described in our media either as &ldquo;world no.1&rdquo; or now &ldquo;former world no.1&rdquo; (Jack Nicklaus won four titles more than Woods). You can tell that the media and Woods&rsquo; corporate backers are dying for Woods to be on top again. I only hope the public has a memory long enough so as to avoid the lesson that stereotypical black behavior is forgivable as long as success is achieved. </p>
<p>I sense though that this guy has a lot more skeletons in the closet, that are being hidden at a great expense.<br>

		<p>Here is a brilliant concept.</p>
<p>Turn the uninhabited areas of Detroit into golf courses. Construction and maintenance would put thousands of local youths to work. Black youth would then flock to Detroit, and embrace golf. Also vacated buildings could be used to house these youths. At a cost of about $100,000,000/year, two problems could be addressed:<br>
1-Lack of black golfers<br>
2-Unemployment at detroit</p>

		<p>This 2011 Master is Tiger Woods&rsquo; final gasp at success.  It was an exciting ride, but the Woods roller coaster is on the speedy down ride.  </p>
<p><br>
The Woods phenomenon was peculiar in that Woods arrived on the professional golf scene when there were no truly first line golfers, except for Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els.  The group of war horses such as Jose Maria Olazabal, Nick Faldo, Ben Crenshaw, Bernhard Langer, Fred Couples, Ian Woosnam, Payne Stewart, Lee Janzen, Corey Pavin, Tom Kite, Hale Irwin, were out to pasture for all practicable purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During Jack Nicklaus winning span 1962-1986 there were great golfers that had won multiple Majors.  Arnold Palmer (7), Billy Casper (3), Gary Player (9), Lee Trevino (6),  Tony Jacklin (2), Raymond Floyd (4), Dave Stockton (2), Johnny Miller (2), Hale Irwin (3), Tom Watson (8), Hubert Green (2), Andy North (2), David Graham (2), Fuzzy Zoeller (2), Seve Ballesteros (5), Larry Nelson (3). </p>
<p></p>
<p>During Woods winning span 1997-2008 he had a depleted field of worthy opponents: Ernie Els (3), Vijay Singh (2), Retief Goosen (2), Phil Mickelson (3), Pádraig Harrington (2), and Ángel Cabrera(2) were the only multiple Major winners.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Nicklaus competed against a much stronger field.  He is still far and away the best golfer ever.  But where should we rank Woods.  He has put up some impressive numbers.  Woods is much like Arnold Palmer who also sparked an increased in the game but Palmer had to fight off Casper, Player, Doug Ford (2), Peter Thomson (5), Julius Boros (3), and of course Nicklaus.    </p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is an objective ranking of great golfers, a ranking unswayed by the Woods mania.  The best is Nicklaus, then move on down the line.  The golfer above any golfer would beat the golfer below on both their best days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Tiger Woods, Arnold Palmer, Harry Vardon, Gene Sarazen.</p>

		<p>However, Woods is only about 1/4 black.  His mom is 100% Thai, and his father was a mixture of Native American, white, and black.  If anything, his emergence onto the golf scene should have inspired more Asian players.</p>
<p>I for one don&rsquo;t mind Woods, but hate how the adoring media and &#8220;golf fans&#8221; treat him.  Yes, he is and has been good.  But there are many golfers just as good or not better that don&rsquo;t get the same praise.  I hope he never wins another major.</p>

<p>Not true. There have long been a few blacks on the PGA tour. The fact is, most blacks are just not good enough to play on the tour.</p>
<p>The problem is, once one black has some success at a white sport, people automatically assume that other blacks will follow and that they will dominate. But Arthur Ashe, Serena Williams and Tiger Woods are anomalies.</p>
<p>For some reason, the success of the Klitschkos, Joe Calzaghe and Ricky Hatton in boxing has not lead sportswriters to wonder why more white Americans are not going into boxing.</p>

		<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is how much white golfers pant for Tiger.I also wonder why when he is 200 players behind why the sports commentators report where Tiger is in the tournament and hardly mention those golfers in the lead.I would like to see a survey conducted to find out whites obsession with Tiger. </p>

		<p>The game of golf does not fit well with the black culture. First of all it is expensive. Even a low end set of clubs costs hundreds. Greens fees are in the $20 dollar range at bottom end courses. Courses have dress codes and behavior codes that do not mix with black norms. Likewise playing the game requires self enforcement of the rules,and gentlemanly behavior,hardly strong points of the black identity. Also why would blacks want to associate with a game popular with White civilized cultures,when they can hang with their own at a basketball court. When was the last time you heard of a brawl or stabbing at a golf course?</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just great. Let&rsquo;s get all those blacks into the country-club settings. Right? Just like Oprah did 2 shows on trying to get blacks into our National parks such as Yosemite! Yeah, now we can camp alongside the Crips and Bloods&hellip;Where is the White backbone? No such thing, I guess. NOTHING for Whites can be allowed to stand in the &#8220;new&#8221; insane America.</p>
<p> Let us draw even more blacks into what used to be White sports/clubs&hellip;I do not watch any game with black players any longer so I guess that leaves me with NOTHING! Even NASCAR now panders to blacks and it makes me sick!  </p>
<p>The arrogance/criminality of most black &#8220;athletes&#8221; leaves me cold and I feel sick even watching our country sinking even faster by the day.</p>

		<p>This article and the comments submitted thus far make me think of the old axiom:  You can lead diversity to water, but you can&rsquo;t make it drink.</p>
<p>Just like the exorbitant resources to lure blacks into golf in the Tiger Woods era has been a flop, in terms of the demographics of PGA Tour pros and regulars at Major tournaments, the same is true of the education system (in spite of the American education dollar disproportionately being diverted to low-IQ blacks for the last two generations, there is not yet a glut of black rocket scientists and brain surgeons), quasi-policing (in spite of a lot of money being spent on one crime prevention program after another after another in ghettoes, blacks are still way more criminal than whites, Hispanics or Asians)   &mdash;   I could go on and on.</p>
<p>6 Grant Landrice:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that Nicklaus not only won 18 Majors, but he also had 19 second-place finishes in Majors.  Combine the two, and you have almost a decade of Nicklaus either winning or placing in Major tournaments.  And most of his second place finishes were to the self same quality competition you cataloged.  Woods, meanwhile, has 14 Major wins but (IIRC) only two second-place finishes, and I think both of those second-place finishes were to golfers you&rsquo;ve never heard of and will never hear from again.  I know one of those was Rich Beem, who was a K-Mart checker before his golf career came through.  No way Jack Nicklaus would have ever let himself be beaten by a K-Mart checker in a Major.</p>
<p>9 The Man:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the field really fears Tiger Woods anymore.</p>

		<p>While there may not have been anyone who looked like Tiger (boo hoo) at the Masters, there was a &#8220;look alike&#8221; at the Outback tourney in Tampa that was televised the following weekend, a guy named Thorpe who was just getting back into golf after a stretch in the slammer for tax evasion.

		<p>Complete balderdash all around.  Woods is a living legend, a fantastic golf player who&rsquo;s been the top name in the sport for years.  Ask any golfer.  Has no one watched the guy play?  His ability to excel at golf really isn&rsquo;t related at all to his private life.  His downfall may be yips caused by guilt feelings; more likely physical breakdown.  Saying that he isn&rsquo;t the real deal sounds like ignorant whining.  We don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>Also the whole premise of the article is idiotic.  Tiger Woods is overwhelmingly NOT a &#8220;black&#8221;.  The bogus term &#8220;african-american&#8221; is at its lamest in describing him.  How would Tiger do strollin&rsquo; the hood in Brownsville or Compton?  HA!</p>
<p>Maybe whites should start claiming as their own product any famous athlete who is 1/8th or more white.</p>
<p>I could make a list.  It would be a long one.<br>

		<p>Though Woods is a phenomenal golfer, I have never rooted for him, and it has nothing to do with the color of his skin. It has to do with his behavior. No other professional golfer whines and complains like Woods does. He acts like the universe owes it to him to make every shot he hits perfect, and whenever he hits a bad shot, he acts like his head is going to explode. He regularly can be seen uttering profanities on live TV, something no other pro golfer ever did before him, and thankfully very few others have followed his example. I learned golf at an early age from my parents, one of whom was a pro golfer and the other a scratch golfer, and if I behaved like Woods does, they would have taken my clubs away and made me walk back to the clubhouse. </p>
