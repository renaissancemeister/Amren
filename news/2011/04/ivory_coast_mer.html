<h1>Ivory Coast Mercenaries &#8216;Are Burning People Alive&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>London Evening Standard, April 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 100 bodies, some of them burned alive, have been found in the Ivory Coast in the past 24 hours, the UN said today.</p>
<p>About 60 were killed in one attack and about 40 people in another that appeared to have been carried out by Liberian mercenaries, said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>He added that &#8220;all the incidents appear at least partly ethnically motivated&#8221; and that there were reports of &#8220;smaller scale killings in other places that have yet to be investigated&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some victims were burned while others were thrown down a well.</p>
<p>The International Rescue Committee warned that chaos in the country was escalating, citing an &#8220;explosive mix of political, economic and ethnic tension&#8221;. &#8220;Even if the political and military showdown in Abidjan ends today, we&rsquo;re concerned that looting, hostility, bloodshed, reprisal killings and sexual assaults will escalate in communities across the country,&#8221; said Louis Falcy, the rescue committee&rsquo;s director in Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of a presidential election in November but Laurent Gbagbo has refused to hand over power.</p>
<p>In his first TV appearance since the siege of the main city of Abidjan began a week ago, Mr Ouattara said that his forces are setting up a security perimeter around the presidential palace where Mr Gbagbo and his family are hiding in a tunnel.</p>
<p>Mr Ouattara said his troops will work to secure the streets of Abidjan, where people have sheltered inside their homes amid heavy arms fire.</p>
<p>He also called for the European Union to lift sanctions so that the country&rsquo;s cocoa exports can resume.<br>

		<p>There was a 1,000 person massacre a few weeks ago committed by Ouattara&rsquo;s forces, so don&rsquo;t think the installation of the new President is going to end the murderous chaos.  Africa is Africa.  </p>
<p><i>He also called for the European Union to lift sanctions so that the country&rsquo;s cocoa exports can resume.</i></p>
<p>Well, I agree with that.  Chocolate is the only useful thing to ever come out of Ivory Coast.  <br>

		<p>The Ivory Coast had its golden era in past colonial splendor, when it was a prosperous and stable country, with a large expat community of white French citizens.</p>
<p>The whites left, the export market deflated, and the country is suffering a brain-drain of its remaining educated blacks. </p>
<p>Years ago, one young black resident was quoted as saying, &#8220;The United States should come&#8221;, followed by his stating that he would take the opportunity to join the Marine Corps, as a stepping stone to escaping to America.</p>

<p>Nothing new, in the 80s they were eating them as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
About 60 were killed in one attack and about 40 people in another that appeared to have been carried out by Liberian mercenaries, said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>More people than you have resources to feed and low-skill jobs to employ.  Not a good thing but not something that we should be more &#8216;outraged&rsquo; about than the locals themselves are.</p>
<p>This -kind- of behavior is common in racially driven &#8216;diverse&rsquo; conditions of warfare.  From the Native Americans practicing barbarian on barbarian tribalism.  To the Japanese in Malaysia believing that those who surrender have no honor to preserve.</p>
<p>The Whites are appalled but the Whites won&rsquo;t admit that why they are angry is because _we don&rsquo;t_ do such things.  And thus are a better breed for it.</p>
<p>This is racism writ large because it refuses to let the blacks b black, the asians be asians and _The West be proud of it&rsquo;s traditions of honor and integrity_ which no other nation state has.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
He added that &ldquo;all the incidents appear at least partly ethnically motivated&rdquo; and that there were reports of &ldquo;smaller scale killings in other places that have yet to be investigated&rdquo;.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>My brother, my cousin, my tribe, my village, my nation, my Islam&hellip;  Social altruism doesn&rsquo;t exist for people with a sub-70 average IQ, they are all about impulse control issues.</p>
<p>We know this.  We could be fixing it right now.  We choose not to because then we would have to look at someone with a different skin and realize that they deserved a fair shake because they thought like us.</p>
<p>As I have said many times: Corporate Socialism is not about saving us.  It&rsquo;s about ensuring an eternal victim state of dependency.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Some victims were burned while others were thrown down a well.</p>
<p>The International Rescue Committee warned that chaos in the country was escalating, citing an &ldquo;explosive mix of political, economic and ethnic tension&rdquo;. &ldquo;Even if the political and military showdown in Abidjan ends today, we&rsquo;re concerned that looting, hostility, bloodshed, reprisal killings and sexual assaults will escalate in communities across the country,&rdquo; said Louis Falcy, the rescue committee&rsquo;s director in Ivory Coast.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Bandaiding the plague.  Until and unless you admit that an utter &#8216;as child and devil&rsquo; _deficit of genetics_ inherent to absent black self control is at work here, you will never come to understand that to fix the problem has nothing to do with making the black man -better off-.</p>
<p>And everything to do with making the black man -different-, genotypically, than what he expresses as inherited traits today.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; <br>
Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of a presidential election in November but Laurent Gbagbo has refused to hand over power.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>He also called for the European Union to lift sanctions so that the country&rsquo;s cocoa exports can resume.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The spice must flow.  The only thing that matters to Western power capitalism.  Whether the Fremen gut each other for their water is their own affair so long as &#8216;necessary democracy&rsquo; happens to keep the books balanced and the debtor status up to date with the IMF et al&hellip;</p>
<p>Africa is a hole.  The only thing we need to learn from it is NOT to import it&rsquo;s problems as it&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s evolutionary psychologies, to OUR lands which are beautiful and filled with beautiful people _because we made them that way_.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has failed.  Globalism -is- failing.  We need to back off of the inherently unmanageable and unstable economic as societal processes that are ongoing and realize we cannot save the planet because we are NOT on the same evolutionary clock.</p>
<p>The blacks window to become like whites has timered out.  If we won&rsquo;t extend genomic therapies to change their inherent nature so that they can support themselves, we should forget trying to make them like us.</p>

		<p>So what else is new?  This has been going on in one form or another since Africa was explored.  But its okay for them to ethnically cleanse.  Here is a rough table of how it is okay:</p>
<p>Black&gt;dark brown&gt;brown&gt;tan&gt;asian&gt;white</p>
<p>Muslim&gt;all others</p>
<p>So long as the one doing the cleansing is farther to the left than the ones being cleansed it is alright.</p>
<p>This incident is black Muslim vs black Christians.  Since Muslim surpasses all other religions, its okay.</p>
<p>Apply this to all conflicts in the world, then look at who the west supports.  It is shockingly accurate.</p>

		<p>The perpetrators, from what I&rsquo;ve been able to find out, are from the side that France is backing with helicopters and troops (Ouattarra). The conflict also has a Christian vs Muslim character as the winning insurgent group, the French supported side, is Muslim; the losers are predominantly Christian. The story about atrocities being committed by &#8220;Liberian mercenaries&#8221; is most likely just a way of diverting blame onto foreigners; the French don&rsquo;t want the bad publicity of being in league with such nasty criminals.  </p>

		<p>Gbagbo was Roman Catholic.  Ouattara is Muslim.  All who think persecution of Christians [and &#8220;sorta Christians&#8221;] is a good activity should appreciate this Barak Hussain Obama supported regime change. </p>

		<p>Where&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Drogba" rel="nofollow">Didier Drogba</a> in all of this? In 2006 he was able to broker a cease-fire in this long-running civil war for the duration of the World Cup. He ought to offer himself as a &#8220;unity president&#8221;   &mdash;   he&rsquo;s almost certainly the most popular Ivorian of them all and the only one the entire population could rally around. Of course, that would mean giving up his megabuck contract at Chelsea, so don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

		<p>The muslim calendar marks this year as 1430. For them, the crusades never ended. For some strange reason Christians became pacifists. Jesus did not mean &#8220;do not defend yourself&#8221; by &#8216;turn the other cheek&rsquo;. Now,since muslim militarism has been growing ever since the European Renaissance, They now have gained enormous power. Christians the world over must get revenge for all the murdered black Christians, after they all die. When White Christians go to war against Black   Muslims the media will not be on our side; but let the enemy speak in horror for generations of the fury of the last stand of the white race. <br>
&#8220;Don&rsquo;t let it end this way&hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Perhaps we can find some white liberals who would like to go to Ivory Coast and tell them to embrace diversity and revel in multicultism? And perhaps such white liberals might follow in the footsteps of Amy Biehl?</p>
