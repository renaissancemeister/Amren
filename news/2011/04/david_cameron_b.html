			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Porter, Graeme Paton, and James Kirkup, Telegraph (London), April 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>David Cameron branded Oxford University &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; after claiming that the institution admitted only one black student in the last academic year.</p>
<p>On a visit to the north of England, the Prime Minister singled out Oxford for criticism when he accused elite institutions of having a &#8220;terrible record&#8221; of enrolling teenagers from state schools.</p>
<p>Senior officials at the university described the figure as &#8220;highly misleading&#8221; as it related only to British students who described themselves as black Caribbean. They said Oxford admitted another 27 students who described themselves as black African and another 14 who were mixed race.</p>
<p>The university also said that only 452 black students across the country had even achieved the A-level results demanded by Oxford to meet its minimum entry requirements for the 2009-10 academic year.</p>
<p>Leading academics and MPs said Mr Cameron risked undermining the ancient institution with his &#8220;ignorant&#8221;, &#8220;absurd&#8221; and &#8220;mind boggling&#8221; comments. It followed controversy last week over Mr Cameron&rsquo;s claim that Britain was responsible for many of the world&rsquo;s historic problems, including the conflict in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The latest fallout will add to growing controversy that the Coalition is attempting to &#8220;socially engineer&#8221; university admissions by asking top institutions to set targets for recruiting students from state schools, poor backgrounds and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Norman Stone, a former Oxford professor now at Bilkent University in Ankara, said Mr Cameron was &#8220;quite wrong&#8221; to be criticising Oxford over its admissions. &#8220;It&rsquo;s absurd for the Prime Minister to be starting this row,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is none of David Cameron&rsquo;s business. I don&rsquo;t think any sensible person would come up with lines like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee, suggested that the Government&rsquo;s approach was wrong. &#8220;The problem we have with various minority groups in this country who don&rsquo;t get into the best universities is that they don&rsquo;t receive a sufficiently good education in the first place,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t solve that by forcing institutions with high standards to lower their intakes, you deal with it by improving the standards of state education for all. That&rsquo;s the betrayal and the scandal here  &mdash;  we don&rsquo;t provide good enough education in our schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We let down the poorest and those from ethnic minorities and that&rsquo;s what we have got to put right, not blame Oxford for the situation we&rsquo;ve got ourselves into.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Smith was president of Magdalen College during the case of Laura Spence 11 years ago, when Gordon Brown called it a &#8220;scandal&#8221; that Oxford had not admitted the high-achieving state-educated pupil. &#8220;It does seem to me that these politicians don&rsquo;t know anything about the country they are governing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The mind boggles. Do they not know what the condition of schools is like in areas where many black Caribbean children are brought up?</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they not read the newspapers and see what goes on there, how difficult it is for a child from one of these communities to get into any university?</p>
<p>Speaking at a PM Direct event in Harrogate, Mr Cameron was asked about tuition fees and the effect they might have on deterring students from poorer backgrounds.</p>
<p>He said universities had to adhere to strict rules if they wanted to charge the maximum fee and he said the country&rsquo;s top institutions needed to attract students from poorer backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw figures the other day that showed that only one black person went to Oxford last year,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I think that is disgraceful. We have got to do better than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, who studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, said leading universities did not have a good record when it came to admitting state school pupils, claiming the numbers had gone down in the past 20 years. &#8220;That is a terrible record,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>An Oxford spokesman said the university was &#8220;fully committed&#8221; to admitting the most able students regardless of background. &#8220;The fact remains that there is a real issue around attainment in schools,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But Noâ€‰10 refused to back down, saying that the university&rsquo;s record on admitting ethnic minorities was &#8220;not that impressive&#8221;. A source said the only words Mr Cameron omitted in his answer were &#8220;British and Caribbean&#8221;.</p>
<p>A Downing Street spokesman said the Prime Minister was trying to make a &#8220;wider point&#8221; that it was &#8220;not acceptable for universities such as Oxford to have so few students coming from black and minority ethnic groups&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some 16,591 students at Oxford disclosed their ethnicity as they started the 2009-10 academic year. Of those, 12,671 were white, 1,477 were Asian, 1,098 were Chinese, 838 were of mixed race and 254 of other ethnicity. Black students accounted for only 253 undergraduates and postgraduates.</p>
<p>It meant that almost a quarter of students were from ethnic minority backgrounds but just 1.5 per cent were black. According to the 2001 census, two per cent of the country was black.</p>

		<p>Lost in all this hubbub is anyone of any consequence advancing the theory that there aren&rsquo;t that many blacks at Oxford because of racial difference in intelligence   &mdash;   There just aren&rsquo;t that many blacks in England or the world with the intelligence and accomplishments to be admitted to Oxford.  As it is, 2% of the UK is black (supposedly, I bet it&rsquo;s higher), while 1.5% of Oxford&rsquo;s 2009 Freshman class is black.  Therefore, Oxford must be using some form of affirmative action for the disparity to be that narrow.</p>
<p>Note that the list of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom are &#8220;all white.&#8221;  Maybe David Cameron should step aside and push for a black Tory or LibDem MP to become the new Prime Minister.</p>

		<p>So it&rsquo;s not a disgrace because its academic performance is so poor, or because it has failed to produce enough skilled professionals to work in the country&rsquo;s job market, or because of its unclean, hostile environment, or because of its lack of structural maintenance, or because of its unusually low standards and lack of morality among the staff and student body.</p>
<p>No, none of that actually. It actually has nothing to do with any of that. It&rsquo;s because there are <i>too many white people there</i>. That, and that alone, makes the university a disgrace.</p>

		<p>If the Brits do what American universities have done, namely, dumb down the admissions standards, they&rsquo;ll get just what Americans have gotten as a result:  universities in name only, that produce students who are not educated but brainwashed, and such students are incapable of performing decently on any job they manage to snag because they don&rsquo;t know anything worth knowing.</p>

<p>Unbelievable!  A levels are not that hard.  One doesn&rsquo;t need to be a genius.  Plus there are thousands of crammers or test prep courses.</p>
<p>American universities are always talking about eliminating the ACTs and SATs because so few blacks and hispanics achieve even low normal scores.</p>

<p>How many qualified, Ace?  The one that was admitted was probably incompetent, but being politically correct they let him/her in anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe there are disgusting types like this Cameron in the white population.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a disgrace to the white race.</p>
<p>However, he DOES offer an excellent example of the types of whites we will want to exclude from any future white society.</p>

		<p>Just a few weeks after decrying &#8220;multiculturalism,&#8221; the politician reverts back to his old ways.</p>
<p>Unlike America however, British academics are apparently honest and not brainwashed liberals.  They find offense (as they should) that the Prime Minister would stick his nose in business that is not his and try and blame the institution for something is not their fault.  If Obama did this in America, you would have universities falling over themselves to admit more minorities  &mdash;  even if that meant lowering their standards. </p>

What various minority groups receive is EXACTLY THE SAME education that the more successful Whites and East Asians. If the darker, lower-achieving children spend their educational years slacking off off, committing petty crime and getting each other pregnant, that is NOT the fault of either the public schools OR universities like Oxford. </p>
<p>Used to be only Lefties blamed Big Bad Whitey for all the social and educational problems of nonwhites. Now even &#8220;Conservative&#8221; Prime Ministers have joined the chorus. </p>

		<p>The brilliant American Black economist and social scientist,<br>
Thomas Sowell, has written with understandable rage about how<br>
Black students, able to function with dignity and genuine success, at second tier universities, will be siphoned up by affirmative action quota needs  into levels of academic rigor for which they are unsuited  &mdash;  the internal emotional injuries being the price Blacks pay for White make-believe appetites.  Cameron maybe has become a type of spiritual cannibal??  And this in the nation that protected itself from harsh truths by &#8220;depublishing&#8221;  Chris Brand&rsquo;s THE &#8220;g&#8221; FACTOR in 1996!!</p>

		<p>And the screws turn tighter to raise profits for all&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Under the Government&rsquo;s plan, all but the poorest students would be expected to pay tuition of up to $1,600 a year, as well as several thousand dollars for room and board. Student loans, to be paid back according to income and over a number of years, would be available for both tuition and living expenses.</p>
<p>Some students said today that the new charges would put an almost unbearable strain on their already shaky finances. Others said that while they would benefit from the more relaxed loan repayment schedule, they felt the Government had abdicated a basic responsibility.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/ijnt9</p>
<p>This was in 1997 when it was feared continued state sponsored education would create a 3.2 billion dollar operating deficit in the higher learning.</p>
<p>NOW we face this-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
One youngster said: &#8216;I&rsquo;d put a lot of effort into that piece of work and it&rsquo;s heartbreaking that somebody changed it.<br>
&#8216;I&rsquo;d rather have my own work back with a lower mark because then I can improve it myself.<br>
&#8216;The teacher was only trying to help us but he&rsquo;s gone about it the wrong way.&rsquo;  <br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/SpcuD</p>
<p>Where grade inflation is so important to even getting /into/ college as a means to sustain a for-profit system that a teacher will overcompensate for his students&rsquo; failures (I would bet that kid is white btw.).</p>
<p>While down at the Universty&hellip;</p>
<p>Just listen to them whinny and whinge and rationalize when &#8216;diversity comes to campus&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Multicult is all well and good when it&rsquo;s over port and in the company of &#8216;safe&rsquo; rhetorically trained individuals used to living in a hypothetical world.  But let the unwashed masses get too close and suddenly you are all come-to-Jesus born again racist conservatives.</p>
<p>AREN&rsquo;T YOU!?</p>
<p>Of course this is the only paragraph in the above article that really matters-</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The Prime Minister, who studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, said leading universities did not have a good record when it came to admitting state school pupils, claiming the numbers had gone down in the past 20 years. &ldquo;That is a terrible record,&rdquo; he said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s an honest record you political chimp.</p>
<p>Statistical distributions of IQ over genetically driven population groups don&rsquo;t lie.  When there are fewer low IQ students at State Schools, there is more attention paid (via curriculum and teacher time) to those who are actually brilliant enough to excel as potential honors scholarship candidates.</p>
<p>And more room in the system to take them.</p>
<p>IQ 100 Whites, with a higher percentage of on-the-edge (112-115 or better) IQs will always produce more of these potential genetics lottery winners than IQ 70 blacks. </p>
<p>You take two decades of gangbangers (90% of Britain&rsquo;s current gun crime is &#8216;Caribbean&rsquo; in origin) being shoved through the system like lard through a tea strainer and just to get them out of the high school environment, standards will be have to be dropped for ALL students.</p>
<p>Which in turn means that those who might have been challenged enough to demand to succeed on their own, won&rsquo;t bother trying because the system is rigged to support failure rather than academic integrity.</p>
<p>And the blacks who think graduating primary school at all is some kind of mandate for higher education will still be stopped by the British higher vs. vocational training cutoffs in their SAT equivalent.</p>
<p>The sad irony here is that -even if- these mooks in the British education system truly only want to sustain the standards that they are used to in teaching the best to the brightest, they have long since shot themselves in the foot by introducing an IQ 70 baseline intelligence to a society that _has always_ demanded IQ 120 or better baseline to sustain it&rsquo;s technological, business and securities innovations.</p>
<p>Low IQ societies cannot sustain the -model- of Western Tradition as a culture of excellence.</p>
<p>And these supposedly smart people are only NOW figuring that out.</p>
<p>Too little.  Too late.</p>
<p>What good was an elite status at a higher institution of _learning_ if these fools wouldn&rsquo;t use their position to pragmatically advise their political leaders as to the nature of the real world demographics until the wolf came clawing at the door of their own personal part of it?</p>

		<p>Oxford has no obligation to &#8220;raise up&#8221; anyone or any group.</p>
<p> I would characterize David Cameron as a &#8220;self-hating&#8221; White (he is White, isn&rsquo;t he?). Why are there so many self-hating Whites in our institutions?  </p>
<p>Cannot Whites have anything that is theirs exclusively? We Whites need to become much, much more assertive!!</p>
<p>In only a couple of short decades, Whites will be a minority in the US. How many readers on this site think that we Whites will be afforded ANY of the set-asides and benefits we have engineered for current minority groups? Take La Raza for example. Do you think that when Whites become the minority, we will have the legal right to form a race-based organization like La Raza or the NAACP?? Not a chance!!! And I love to quote the motto of La Raza: &#8220;For the Race, everything; for those outside the Race, Nothing.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Considering that Britain is an originally white country, who cares if its universities are all-white? What if its because whites in Britain actually want to make something of themselves and further their education and so many of the non-whites there just don&rsquo;t really care to?</p>
<p>This David Cameron sounds like nothing more than a leftist moonbat who preaches multiculturalism while living in an all-white area.</p>

		<p>This David Cameron sounds like nothing more than a leftist moonbat who preaches multiculturalism while living in an all-white area.<br>

<p>Indeed #25, no less and no more than Bush eh. So much for muscular Liberalism here and across the pond. </p>

It might be very British and very New Testament, BTW, to permit<br>
Blacks at an IQ level of, say, 130  &mdash;  a dozen of them selected from the middle of the African continent to attend Oxford.  Modern technology makes it quite feasible to have a video-audio record of all their academic interactions, tutorials, seminar attendance, etc.  Professor Valberg&rsquo;s contributions via AR serve to indicate to us that such Blacks would have no problem admitting they &#8220;catch on&#8221; only to portions of what the Oxford mentalsphere (what? average IQ 145-150? ) offers.  This is not  &mdash;  and ought not be anywhere  &mdash;  a problem for them or for those emotionally suited at Oxford to interface with them.  The technological record would be the stuff of a bombshell documentary.  The issue is honesty and factual authenticity  &mdash;  now whether Oxford has an obligation or not. As often is the case with humans, one the facts are made stark and complete, the problem tends to wilt to manageable size and mainstream media tgends to be further exposed as the major matrix of our delusphere.   </p>

		<p>Cameron&rsquo;s hypocrisy beggars belief.  Try and find a white working class student at Oxford or Cambridge.  There is more chance of encountering a Rabbi in Mecca than a prole in the hallowed cloisters of Oxbridge, yet the silence from Cameron and his ilk on this centuries-old injustice is deafening. </p>

<p>The white working class on average have low IQ (that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re the working class and not the elite) and as a result lack the ability to secure admission to elite colleges such as Oxford, Cambridge, or the LSE. </p>
