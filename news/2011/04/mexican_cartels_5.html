<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42061290/ns/world_news-americas/">Mexican Cartels Corrupting More US Border Officials?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Potter, MSNBC, April 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In El Paso, Texas, a major embarrassment for American law enforcement: U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer Margarita Crispin is sentenced to 20 years in prison for selling out to Mexican drug traffickers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the Mexican drug war, U.S. authorities are finding a disturbing trend: an increase in American law enforcement officials corrupted by wealthy Mexican criminals who pay them to look the other way as illegal drugs and immigrants flow north into the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the last five years, nearly 80 U.S. Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Protection officers have been arrested along the Mexican border, and according to federal authorities, hundreds more officials are under investigation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Corruption runs deep</b></p>
<p>At a U.S. Senate hearing, it was revealed that Mexican cartel members are infiltrating American law enforcement. There was also testimony that during a hiring push that began five years ago to add thousands of Border Patrol and CBP officers, only 10 percent of the initial applicants were given polygraph tests.</p>
<p>Of those, 60 percent failed, raising concerns about the integrity of the others hired without screening.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Along the border, the federal authorities aren&rsquo;t the only ones facing corruption problems. Local authorities, including sheriffs and police officers, have also succumbed to the lure of drug money.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Policing the police</b></p>
<p>To try to stem the corruption, President Obama recently signed a law requiring polygraph tests for all border patrol and customs law enforcement job applicants. Additionally, thirteen FBI anti-corruption teams now keep an eye on the 2,000-mile-long border, policing the police.</p>

		<p>Open borders enthusiasts like to cite El Paso, Texas&rsquo;s supposedly low crime rate as an example of successful Hispanic integration, and as a supposed counter argument to crime being used as a concern against open borders.</p>
<p>The reason El Paso&rsquo;s &#8220;official&#8221; crime rate is low, according to the former head of the Federal government&rsquo;s inter-jurisdictional El Paso task force (DEA/CBP/etc.) is that a Mexican cartel or sundry Mexican criminals will do as much of their dirty work on the Juarez side as possible, in order to avoid American law enforcement.  They might murder someone in El Paso by kidnapping him and taking him to Juarez, killing him there.  So the murder doesn&rsquo;t appear on El Paso&rsquo;s stat sheet.</p>

		<p>Anyone can become corrupt, regardless of race, but this type of entry level corruption on such a wide scale was not a facet of life back in my formative years.  A cop could be a jerk, but you never assumed that the average cop was a narco thug in uniform.</p>
<p>As we fade away and the black and brown &#8216;paradise&rsquo; of &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; overtakes the nation, expect levels of corruption our grandfathers could never dream of - oh wait - that&rsquo;s what goes on everyday in the third world!  We&rsquo;re just importing it all here.  Thanks liberals.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Mexican Cartels Corrupting More US Border Officials?&#8221;</p>
<p>Several pundits have been warning about the creeping influence of cartels and their incessant spread throughout the US.  They&rsquo;ve been proven correct once again.  When are they going to be heeded?  Their cautionary alerts about the impending takeover of the Mexican government are being ignored as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering if the border is left wide open, because billions of drug dollars find their way into the pockets of liberal Democrats and a few Republicans.</p>
<p>Has anybody but me made note of the fact that as the US and world economy plummets the drug cartels are earning larger and larger profits than ever before?</p>

		<p>Immigrants from corrupt countries are certainly bringing corruption with them to the west.  But we are not supposed to talk about it apparently  &mdash;  it is not politically correct.  </p>
<p>Look at the Corruption Perception Index:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3zdx9up" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3zdx9up</a></p>
<p>At least in America you give long prison sentences to the corrupt border guards when they are caught.  In Canada the justice system is a pathetic joke run by bleeding heart liberals.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve commented on this before.  The trouble for border agents and officers began when the old Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was abolished and rolled into the Customs and Border Protection(CBP)agency created under DHS.</p>
<p>Customs is and was known as the most useless and brain dead &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; agency at the federal level.  With the merger of INS into Customs, the latter was able to spread its stupidity to border inspectors and Border Patrol guards. We are seeing the results.  </p>
<p>The CBP Office of Training Development (OTD) is now in charge of training border officers and Border Patrol guards.  Since OTD took over, the training standards have been watered down to very basics,(if that). It&rsquo;s all about the numbers, especially minorities,and little about quality. Their motto is <b>&#8220;For all who enter, check in your brain, you&rsquo;ll have no use for it here&#8221;</b>. <br>
 <br>
For you idiots at the DHS &#8220;conFusion Centers&#8221; who monitor sites like this in search of &#8220;haters&#8221; at the behest of the $outhern Propaganda Lie Center ($PLC), I suggest you become double agents and look at your chain of command.  There you will find all you can handle.</p>
<p>One warning though.  Once you blow the whistle, DHS will move quickly to make your life miserable and eventually fire you, no matter how correct you are. Therefore, I suggest that before you begin clandestine investigations of your &#8220;superiors&#8221;, develop a legal source of independent income. This will sustain you while you try to get your job back, if you want it. And, always,always cover yourself, &#8220;management&#8221; will frame you for an illegal act if they can get by with it. </p>
<p>If you can stomach it without doing anything, infiltrate their homosexual rings as well.  </p>
<p>But directly to the article, it&rsquo;s been known for a long time that gang bangers and drug cartels have infiltrated the federal level of LE. It&rsquo;s easy. They pick a relatively clean member and get him in as an officer and agent to work from the inside. Presto. The question is how extensive and to what level the infiltration reaches. </p>
<p>This article deals with low level agents, who by the way, are paid rather well.  Why haven&rsquo;t senior level perps ever been rounded up?  One in particular comes to mind, Johnny Sutton, former US Attorney, Texas and Bush crony.    </p>
<p>In my opinion there is (was) certainly &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; to investigate why he went to extraordinary lengths to harass and imprison border guards. Besides doing the bidding of the Lie Center, who else was he working for?  Certainly legit questions. But alas, time has moved on.   </p>

		<p>Fence the border.</p>
<p>East Germany never had a problem with contraband from the West like we have with Mexico for the simple reason that they had a legitimate border with Western Germany and all such illegal material had to flow through specific check points whose &#8216;honesty&rsquo; could be vetted.</p>
<p>Fence the border.</p>
<p>And with a ditch, two fences and mines down the middle, we can stop the drugs and the illegal immigration.</p>
<p>I will add one other thing here and that is that not only is corruption rampant from the outside but from among our own as well.</p>
<p>It is &#8216;good business&rsquo; to import breeder races who create massive junk consumerism and rapid volume turnover in cash.  If &#8216;profit&rsquo; as that volume vs. the cheapest Asian consumer goods you can find, is the only metric you measure your worth by.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with social accountability of private industry to the culture they inhabit.  What is wrong is that corporate greed is disenfranchising whites, not helping us sustain our people.</p>
<p>_Fence_.  _The_.  _Border_.</p>
<p>And 99.999% of your problems with narcotopia Mexico will go away.</p>
<p>Just be prepared to deal, harshly, with the bastards who depend on that illegal traffic to sustain their illicit and highly damaging private wealth base.</p>

		<p>I thought this was a &#8220;war&#8221; on drugs?  We all know better.  If it was a war we would be using military instead of county mounties and park rangers.  I&rsquo;m not implying that would necessarily be the solution either.  If this is a war, isn&rsquo;t helping the enemy treason?  What is the penalty for treason during a war?  Is it still death?  Death could deter selling out your country and fellow officers for money.  </p>
<p>Side note:  Was watching a program talking about our government&rsquo;s plan of survival and continuing operation pending a nuclear strike.  They went into pretty precise detail.  Not one mention of prevention.  Just a couple quick blurbs about port authority and shipping containers.  Not ONE mention about Southern border security.  Nothing.  The terrorists must really laugh about how easy we make it for them.  </p>

		<p>I think youve made some truly interesting points.  Not too many people would actually think about this the way you just did.  Im really impressed that theres so much about this subject thats been uncovered and you did it so well, with so much class.  Good one you, man!  Really great stuff here.</p>
