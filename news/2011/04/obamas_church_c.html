<h1>Obama&rsquo;s Church Choice for Easter Based on Race?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Parker, WRNO-FM (New Orleans), April 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The one and only detail reported about Shiloh Baptist Church was that it was founded by freed slaves during the Civil War. There was no mention that this was the first Presidential visit to Shiloh, nor any mention that this inaugural visit could be more than a coincidence. </p>
<p>Was there no mention that this is a predominately black church because the media didn&rsquo;t want the American people to know that our President chooses his church based on race? I&rsquo;m reticent to openly guess at the media&rsquo;s intentions, but when flattering facts are reported and unflattering facts are omitted, we have no choice but to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One has to dig into the blog notes from various reporters to piece together the content from the sermon. Aside from the First Couple being honored guests, Pastor Wallace Charles Smith also announces that his 4 week old grandson is attending church for the first time, and a pool reporter noted an interesting perspective on the infant:<blockquote>&#8220;[Pastor Smith] talked about how his baby grandson&rsquo;s gurgling is actually &#8220;talking&#8221; because he is saying &#8216;I am here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they tried to write me off as 3/5 a person in the Constitution, but I am here right now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and is saying I am not going to let anybody from stopping me from being what God wants me to be.&rsquo;&#8221;<br>
</blockquote>The pastor hears American institutional racism in a baby&rsquo;s gurgle? Do most people with infants hear Constitutional bigotry in their baby&rsquo;s gibberish? Did any mention of the 3/5 clause or racism in general make it into the Easter service you attended? Is this pastor&rsquo;s amazing leap from a baby bark to white oppression another coincidence to add to the list, or has he established a pattern of race baiting and white bashing in the past?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While this pastor is a little less flamboyant than Jeremiah Wright in both tone and wardrobe, the evidence is in: Obama prefers and actively seeks out these churches, race is our President&rsquo;s primary motivation on a variety of decisions, and the media will actively provide cover for minority racists as long as it fits their narrative.<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about this.  Didn&rsquo;t we all learn the lesson the news media taught us about three years ago?  Barack Obama can specifically choose a church to gain street cred, patronize it for 19 years, yet not be affected by the preacher&rsquo;s hate sermons because he doesn&rsquo;t pay attention when he&rsquo;s in church.</p>

		<p>Pastor Smith is ignorant about the meaning of the three-fifths clause.  Abysmally ignorant.  </p>
<p>Saying that the Constitution declared a black to be 3/5 of a human being overstates the situation.  The Constitution came closer to stating that blacks were 0/5 human.  Slaves had zero political rights and all but zero civil and legal rights.</p>

Other mainstream sources refereed to this as an &#8220;historically black church&#8221;.</p>
<p>Are there any &#8216;historically white churches&rsquo;? If so, how are they talked about in the MSM? Are they praised for being &#8216;historically white&rsquo; or denounced and condemned?</p>
<p>You can have an &#8216;historically black&rsquo; anything and be universally praised. All effort will be made to ensure it remains &#8216;historically black&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In contrast, when they talk about &#8216;historically white neighborhoods&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s only to denounce them as &#8216;racist&rsquo; and needing to be destroyed (integrated and diversified).</p>
<p>What is historically black is good. What is historically white bad.</p>

		<p> It does indeed appear (to no one&rsquo;s surprise) that the Mulatto Messiah chooses his churches for the highest amount of anti-White rhetoric, thinly disguised as Protestant sermons, as possible. But, as Mr. Parker said, don&rsquo;t expect the mainstream media to utter a peep about it.</p>
<p> And yet, wasn&rsquo;t it interesting that when Bill Clinton was president, and was attending services in a different black church every Sunday (well, it SEEMED that way, anyhow), the media went out of its way to note, approvingly, the fact that he did that. What would they say if Obama suddenly surprised everyone and attended a White evangelical suburban church for once?</p>

		<p>This is just more political posturing from the empty suit.  Nothing, absolutely nothing the man does isn&rsquo;t planned to keep his  strongest voting bloc happy.  The empty suit isn&rsquo;t religious and probably couldn&rsquo;t tell you the reason Easter is an important holiday for Christians, but he does know that going to anti-white churches always makes blacks happy.  </p>

		<p>When I saw the comments on the original article, I am still amazed by how many white folks still insist that blacks have a good reason to moan and complain about their collective past. The 3/5 Compromise is no longer relative or applicable. How can it be debated as if it were?  Slavery in the US was oulawed years ago, and no one who lived under the system in the US is still alive. So many large cities in this nation have MLK this or that, museums of black history and mostly black governments. They maintain their &#8220;historically black&#8221; institutions (colleges, fraternaties, churches, cemeteries, etc.) They get special college funding, affirmative action is still the law-of-the-land, and they have their own media. Many more people seem to bend over backwards for them than not. In Baltimore, a valuable piece of privately owned real estate is going to be maintained as a black &#8220;historical site&#8221; because one sit-in in the name of civil rights occurred there 50 years ago and a group of blacks insist upon it. (Ironically, when this property was the center of the mostly white shopping district that &#8220;went black&#8221; and it all shut down in the 1970s, nobody did a thing to save that building or any other in the area.) For some reason though, so many people insist that blacks deserve more and more and more.     </p>

Sometime I will ask them to tell me a thing or two he has done and I always get one of these two remarks.</p>

		<p>I recall reading about the Obama family attending church on Christmas and that he made the statement that the family does not attend church every Sunday because it would be &#8220;too disruptive&#8221;. So Obama only takes his family to church on certain days and times. What a great example to set for America, the President goes to church whenever he feels like it. Of course he attends a racist black church, that is the message he wants to send to America. I can&rsquo;t recall another President who did not attend church services regularly.</p>

		<p>Here are the facts ignorant people like Pastor Wallace Charles Smith and Al Gore need to know about the 3/5ths clause:</p>
<p>1.  The 3/5ths clause occurs in Article I, section 2 where it is<br>
stated how people are to be counted for the purpose of allocating representatives proportional to population among the states.</p>
<p>2.  It counts all free people (except Indians, not taxed) as 100% of a person.  So from the start blacks who were not slaves counted as a full person.</p>
<p>3.  Advocates of slavery wanted slaves to count as a full person.  Slaves were not allowed to vote, so the effect would be to increase the representation in the House of Representatives of the non-slaves in states that had slavery, including the slave owners.</p>
<p>4.  Opponents slavery wanted slaves to count as 0, so as not to increase the representation of states that allowed slavery.</p>
<p>Blacks and ignorant white liberals who whine that the Constitution should have counted slaves as 100% of a person are taking the same side as the slave owners.<br>

		<p>Barry gave no Christmas message as other presidents always have. Not a word about the Christian holidays, Good Friday and Easter, no traditional message given. He commented about Passover that he can relate the &#8220;message&#8221; of the Jewish holiday to the Muslim struggle. Barry hasn&rsquo;t missd an opportunity to deliver his &#8220;message&#8221; on even obscure Muslim holidays. The &#8220;message&#8221; from Barry couldn&rsquo;t be clearer to me. Barry is a Muslim. Raised a Muslim in Indonesia where he grew up. You can&rsquo;t see his records because they list him as a Muslim, and you can&rsquo;t see his college transcripts because he was admitted to Columbia and Harvard through affirmative action programs or as a foreign student. Nobody remembers him. Every year Columbia and Harvard never mention him. No speeches at his Alma Mater. No class reunions featuring a speech or apperance by the President, a former student. I know the grades that George Bush received at Yale. And the grades that Al Gore and John Kerry received at Yale ( they had lower grades than GWB ), but nothing about Barry. We&rsquo;ve all heard about GWB, Al Gore and John Kerry,what they did, what they didn&rsquo;t do, for years before they were president. NOTHING about Barry. Because Barry is a secret Muslim foreigner at worst, or an under achieving affirmative action plant at best.</p>

<p>Surprise..surprise&hellip;.more misinformation from the site&rsquo;s (John&rsquo;s)liberal perspective. Maybe you need to research all the stuff Obama did and said that was clearly ANTI-Christian. Since you say you are so hip on &#8220;history&#8221; it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard for you to do.</p>
<p>Reagan was a Christian and talked about it alot. Obama is NOT and it clearly shows.</p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t go to church either but I am a Christian. Today&rsquo;s churches don&rsquo;t preach the real Biblical truths, so I would much rather READ the Bible with understanding, than listen to the false prophets of today.</p>

		<p>Here we have a man of the cloth, a representative of Christ fomenting still more resentment of and hatred for Whites. This, in spite of decades of social programs, set asides, AA, cowtowing by Whites and years of Whites meekly looking the other<br>
way in the face of ever increasing violence and terror being visited upon us; aided and abetted by our own government&rsquo;s refusal to hold them responsible.<br>
He tells them that racism is just as bad as ever but now wears a different costume. <br>
It&rsquo;s NEVER going to be over for them. As long as they worship at the altar of &#8220;systemic racism&#8221; they will never have to be accountable for their own failures and shortcomings. They love the notion that they always have an excuse for their self inflicted problems.</p>
<p>When he mentioned the Swim Club, he conveniently avoided mention of the obnoxious behavior of the &#8220;students&#8221; who came into the club with that &#8220;we&rsquo;re taking over&#8221; demeanor which immediately causes Whites to go to DEFCON 4. He also added that Hispanics are also barred from the club in an effort to gain support from that segment. Most Hispanics whom I know have no desire to be around Blacks for any length of time.</p>

		<p>When this blatant anti-white racist was first elected, many of us warned to keep our heads down, because the anti-white bias was going to be at least 4 years in duration and very bad.</p>
<p>But, while we were aware what lay ahead generally, we weren&rsquo;t able to know the specifics of how bad anti-white conditions would get.  We have a much better idea now, and the situation is as bad as we expected, but, speaking for myself, I never guessed the media would be so biased in the holy one&rsquo;s favor as it has turned out to be in the face of this man&rsquo;s obvious basic anti-white, pro-black agenda.</p>
<p>This same media NEVER spells out its basic political precepts, preferring to say and do everything to promote this evil black miscreant and his anti-white haters, while, at the same time, thoroughly demonizing everything and everybody that has a legitimate opposing point of view.</p>
<p>Look at them, speaking in one voice on the birther issue.  They base their conclusions on highly questionable evidence declaring it to be irrefutable facts, as if they are on a fanatical pursuit to install a God who has come to earth, never once giving reasons as to why they support him other than blatant lies&hellip;and not very many of those.</p>
<p>These bigoted, gullible fools in the media have got to go somehow.  They have got to go, as well as the people behind them who manipulate the way they think. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard rumors that there are people who are taking notes and recording names.  I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be a media fool if the economic crunch causes a societal collaspse.</p>

Obama picked the church because he wanted to accumulate &#8220;street cred&#8221; for what he thought would be a political career mainly anchored on the South Side of Chicago.  But when his path took a different and more national route, and people started digging stuff up, he had to try and sweep it all under the rug by saying that he never paid attention to Wright&rsquo;s extremist hate sermons or anything he had to say.</p>
<p><i>it drowns out his voice when he speaks</i></p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s the teleprompter&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p><i>disrespects his wife</i></p>
<p>Quit telling us to eat &#8220;health&#8221; food all the while she&rsquo;s eating ice cream and fatty ribs.  And this is the same fool that tells us that all these children have to slim down in order to be fit for military service, all the while her husband campaigned on the military and military action being passe.  This is the same fool who says kids need to be more active, while the ilk of her drones in the New York State bureaucracy wanted to ban tag, dodgeball, wiffle ball and red rover at summer camps because they&rsquo;re &#8220;dangerous.&#8221;  Spare me, troll.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>makes fun of his children</i></p>
<p>Red herring.  We don&rsquo;t touch the daughters with a ten foot pole, or a 20-foot pole, or a 20-mile pole.  Their father, on the other hand, while demanding of us that we leave them alone (rightly so, they&rsquo;re teenage and pre-teen girls who deserve some semblance of a normal family life), keeps on shoving them in our faces every time you turn around.  As if he&rsquo;s trying to bait us into talking about them to work up some reason to get mad at all of us.  Well, troll, I&rsquo;m not biting.</p>
<p><br>
<i>challenges his political beliefs</i></p>
<p>A politician has his political beliefs challenged.  What were the odds of that?  Next thing you know, they&rsquo;ll be telling us that we can replace him November of next year.  Which ought to send you into orbit.</p>
<p><i>describes him as having a Kenyan perspective, even though he&rsquo;s only been to Kenya twice</i></p>
<p>For someone who has only been to Kenya twice, and someone whom they keep telling us wasn&rsquo;t born there, Kenya never had a better friend or a more fierce advocate.  Personally, I think Obama was born in Honolulu, and has been hiding his LFBC all along just be a jerk and to create a diversion.  Machiavellian-like.  Probably Rahm&rsquo;s or Axelrod&rsquo;s idea.  Still, Kenya seems to have a lot of his attention for some reason.  Gee, could it be genes?</p>

<p>Thankyou WR for putting the truth about the 3/5th clause out, but how sad that it took 12 comments to make it and I don&rsquo;t see  others exposing this distortion; I guess it reflects how history is taught these days.<br>
  This fabrication about blacks back then being not quite human is such a crock, and that fact should be shouted from the rooftops. If I ever come across a 3/5th-er, my first question is, why did Abolitionists want slaves to count as 0?. The baffled looks are priceless. <br>
