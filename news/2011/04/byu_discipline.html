<h1>BYU Discipline Harsher on Black Athletes, Report Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peggy Fletcher and Kristen Moulton, Salt Lake Tribune, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black athletes at Brigham Young University are four times more likely than white athletes to be disciplined for violating the school&rsquo;s honor code, according to research reported Wednesday on <a href="http://deadspin.com/#!5791461/the-truth-about-race-religion-and-the-h%20onor-code-at-byu">deadspin.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1993, &#8220;at least 70 athletes have been suspended, dismissed, put on probation, or forced to withdraw from their teams or the school after running afoul of the honor code,&#8221; write Luke O&rsquo;Brien and Darron Smith. &#8220;Fifty-four of them, or nearly 80 percent, are minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The authors, who interviewed dozens of athletes, say a &#8220;loose hierarchy&#8221; applies sanctions for breaking the school&rsquo;s honor code, which requires students to refrain from alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea as well as pre-marital sex.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The most severe punishment,&#8221; according to O&rsquo;Brien and Smith, &#8220;is reserved for non-Mormon black athletes, according to our data and several athletes we interviewed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Provo school has taken some steps to improve the situation, the authors report, including hiring the first person of color, Vernon L. Heperi, a Pacific Islander, as dean of students and honor code enforcer.</p>
<p>Smith, a black Mormon who taught at BYU from 1998 to 2005, remains deeply concerned about black athletes who are recruited by the LDS Church-owned university.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must do better,&#8221; Smith said in an email. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve said this over and over again.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I think they&rsquo;re confusing &#8220;harsher&#8221; and &#8220;more often&#8221; (deliberately so).  If there were only one possible punishment, life in prison without parole, for those convicted of first degree murder, and every person who commits Murder 1 is caught and convicted, no matter the race of the convicts, then you can&rsquo;t say that blacks are being punished more harshly than whites.  But since we know there will be more blacks caught than whites, as a percentage of their racial group&rsquo;s total population (and depending on the demographics of the jurisdiction, more in raw numbers, too), then it is true that blacks are disproportionately punished.  Only because they&rsquo;re disproportionately murdering.</p>
<p>As the person who does SBPDL states, you can have moral and ethical standards, or you can have high black participation.  But you can&rsquo;t have both.</p>

<p>So the black honor code breakers are the ones saying they&rsquo;re punished more severely?  Surprise, surprise.  </p>
<p>Blacks are ALWAYS claiming to disciplined more harshly for breaking rules.  They think everyone acts just like them, only whites don&rsquo;t enforce rules against each other.  It never occurs to blacks that their neighborhoods and schools are unruly and crime-ridden <i>precisely</i> because they break rules much more often.  White environments are much more pleasant and orderly because we generally follow rules.  <br>

<p>There&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>To win at any cost, they recruit non-Mormon blacks. </p>
<p>Solution: raise your standards and stop trying to win at all costs. </p>

<p>No. THEY must do better. WE are not the problem. THEY are the problem. Tell THEM to read the honor code policy closely before THEY agree to join the team.</p>

		<p> This is the kind of &#8220;exposing Mormon perfidy&#8221; article one could expect from the Salt Lake Tribune. Any fair-minded person who reads it frequently could tell you that the Tribune&rsquo;s editorial leanings are liberal   &mdash;   for Utah, anyway   &mdash;   and that it never misses a chance to stick a thumb into the eye of Utah&rsquo;s Mormon establishment.</p>
<p> Read the Trib on a regular basis and you will see many stories ostensibly about the Mormons, but appearing to have been designed to bring forth the most scurrilous, over-heated anti-Mormon comments from readers, that you can imagine.</p>
<p> The reporters who wrote this &#8220;investigative piece&#8221; chose to hunt up and interview a black Mormon attorney, who, surprise, surprise! accuses BYU of racial discrimination in its application of penalties for Honor Code violations. And just who were these &#8220;dozens of athletes&#8221; who seem so knowing about a racial and religious hierarchy in the ranks of those who are penalized, and those who supposedly &#8220;get away&#8221; with the same infractions?</p>
<p> Finally, could it be possible, just maybe, that minority athletes COMMIT more infractions? That possibility is never so much as hinted at, is it? </p>

<p>Of course it won&rsquo;t be reported that blacks violate the honor code by a factor of 4&hellip;AT LEAST.</p>
<p>This is just plain disgusting.  It&rsquo;s like reporting blacks are more likely to go to prison than whites per their percentage of the population, then blaming it on racism and neglecting to report that blacks commit 58% of ALL violent crimes and other crimes far in excess of any other group.</p>
<p>It is indeed the age of liars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to mail out the &#8220;Color of Crime&#8221; again folks to our local DJ&rsquo;s and law enforcement.</p>

I know I will be perceived as crazy for even suggesting as much, but isn&rsquo;t it possible that black athletes are four times as likely as whites to actually violate the school&rsquo;s honor code, resulting in discipline? </p>
<p>I suppose in the minds of Peggy Fletcher and Kristen Moulton, this can never be a possibility, as the only conclusion must be white racism working against poor blacks.<br>

		<p>@Wayne- As a non-Mormon who has lived in the Salt Lake Valley for 6 years I have seen how the Tribune has been the far more liberal paper.</p>
<p>As far as BYU and any other school that has an honor code, blacks are made aware of the rules just as every other entering student as well as the consequences of breaking those rules. If a prospective student does not feel that he or she can abide by what is expected of them they can enroll in a state university or any other school that does not expect high standards of behavior. </p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t there enough White athletes in the Mormon community that they could do really well in just about any sport? Bring Blacks into a REALLY white community is a recipe for trouble. Even the Pacific Islanders tend to be sub-performers of Utah and they generally share the Mormon faith. </p>
<p>I would imagine that the Honor Code is spelled out up front to anyone who wishes to attend BYU. If you wish to attend a University in Utah that doesn&rsquo;t require these codes, there are several including Utah Valley University in Orem, which is right next to Provo. There is not a Starbucks on the UVU campus, but according to the Starbucks web site there is a store at the University Mall just down the road from both schools. </p>
<p>I have never had a desire to attend BYU and if I lived in Utah, I would probably have attended a state college. However, this is a Mormon run institution and they ask that you follow their customs. If for some oddball reason, I had to go work in the Middle East and bring my family along, my wife may well have to get used to wearing a head scarf. Their country, their rules. </p>
<p>Question: Who would you rather have a neighbors, White Mormons who may have unusual religious customs, but are a pretty moral people or a gaggle of Blacks? I have never had the 2 clean cut young men threaten to bust a cap in my A** for not wishing to be proselytized.  </p>

<p>The reporterettes misinterpreted the original article, found in the deadspin link, which didn&rsquo;t say that black athletes are four times more likely to be disciplined than white athletes. I haven&rsquo;t calculated the actual multiple, nor do I think that the data presented in the original article are sufficient to calculate it. For one thing, they confuse &#8220;minority&#8221; with &#8220;black&#8221;. 23% of the athletes were minorities, yet 77% of the suspensions were of minorities, including Polynesians.</p>
<p>Several of the suspended players reported that they had met girls on their recruiting trips (unknown to the school), and they somehow got the impression that the Honor Code wasn&rsquo;t to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I suspect that BYU is an excellent school for serious Mormon students, but perhaps not so for non-Mormon students, especially for athletes expecting a little, or a lot of, tail. </p>
<p>With regard to the deadspin article by O&rsquo;Brien and Smith, Smith had been a professor at BYU but was released after publishing a book titled &#8220;Black and Mormon&#8221;. Do you think that he might have an ax to grind?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually surprised that there are any blacks at BYU, much less athletes. BYU and the Mormons in general do not have a good reputation among the Bantu. ONLY until recently, blacks were not allowed into the Mormon priesthood. Could be a Mormon, but not aspire to priesthood. That term not the same as would be a Catholic priest incidentally.</p>

<p>Some colleges actually have hostesses comprised of Frosh/Sophomore coeds whose duty is to accompany High School athletes whom the institutions are trying to recruit. There have been investigations into exactly what these girls&rsquo; duties entail.  <br>
If I had a college age daughter today, she&rsquo;d be a commutor student and to Hell with the &#8220;college experience&#8221;.  You send your daughter away to college and the athletic dept. wants to pimp her out to some unqualified, socially promoted, sociopathic basketball/football playing Mau Mau. Oh I forgot to mention &#8220;ugly&#8221;</p>

		<p>Did you read what Smith said?  we must do better.  Why?  Why shouldn&rsquo;t the individual do better?  The system is always at fault not the individual violating the systems rules and requirement.</p>
<p>From the basic individual to the highest levels of world governments (usa), the individual is never guilty, it&rsquo;s always the system failing that individual.  What a sham, what a path to stupidity, dumbing down the whole of a country and down to famiies and individuals just because nothing is required or enforced.  </p>

That says it all- Hip Hop. <br>
Of course there is no mention of who the perpetrators were although it was mentioned that no Rutgers students were involved.<br>

		<p>The biggest cultural shock to black urban thugs who end up at BYU is when they meet a blonde haired white woman who says no. However the deportment of most black kids at BYU is far superior to what goes on everywhere else.  Compare Provo to Gainesville, Miami, or Tallahassee. The military academies have had trouble with this problem. There was even a rape and murder at Annapolis. Concepts or personal integrity and honor are alien to modern black urban thugs.  West Point spends an entire first term teaching them old fashioned values as if they came from the planet Mongo. BYU works hard on keeping their athletes off the front pages. The true story of this last incident has not been shown. My feelings is that he forced himself on a Mormon girl who was too ashamed to call it rape. She might have told the honor people that he acted normally for his kind.<br>

		<p>What a difference a few decades makes. I can remember the 1970s, when BYU was pilloried in the MSM for not admitting blacks at all, as the Book of Mormon supposedly claimed blacks were inferior. Back then the basketball team recruited whites from as far away as Yugoslavia. One wonders what the LDS leadership was thinking when they decided to open the floodgates. Expecting blacks to follow any kind of honor code (especially one that prohibits sex) is like expecting velociraptors to eat grass and leaves.</p>

 <i>&#8220;What a difference a few decades makes. I can remember the 1970s, when BYU was pilloried in the MSM for not admitting blacks at all, as the Book of Mormon supposedly claimed blacks were inferior. Back then the basketball team recruited whites from as far away as Yugoslavia. One wonders what the LDS leadership was thinking when they decided to open the floodgates.&#8221;</i><br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>They were doubtless thinking dollar signs, as Washington (in the form  of the Jimmy  Carter  government) was turning up the screws and threatening to have a look at the very wealthy Mormon Church&rsquo;s  investments and tax exemptions. Blacks were also picketing the Church&rsquo;s annual convention in Salt Laker City, a messy PR  situation. </p>
<p>In 1978, the church got the message and had a  &#8220;divine revelation&#8221;, agreeing to admit  blacks to the priesthood. (Women are still not admitted, and the fundamentalist Mormons still do not admit blacks.)</p>

		<p>No coffee, tea, alcohol and sex is hard for people not brought up as mormons.</p>
<p>I have given up alcohol and sex.  I never liked tea.  But I would never become a mormon if it meant giving up coffee.</p>
<p>As for blacks giving up sex, that is like asking them to give up breathing.  Black kids often become sexually active at 12 for boys, 10 for girls.  Furthermore, they have an unusually early interest in sex starting around age 5 with totally disgusting comments, assaults and pawing.</p>
<p>Most black boys have been sexually active since about 12, with their sisters if no one else is available. How can they give it up now, even if it means giving up their scholarship.  How can one possibly ask a black to think ahead when something they want is right in front of them?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Some colleges actually have hostesses comprised of Frosh/Sophomore coeds whose duty is to accompany High School athletes whom the institutions are trying to recruit. &#8216;</p>
<p>Most colleges have these girls.  The feminazis hate them because the girls are always very pretty.</p>
<p>I am sure that in every college in the country the black students whoever they are are just like black high school students.  More likely to be troublemakers, commit crimes from rape to shoplifting and petty theft, cheat on exams, fail to attend class etc etc etc.  And far more likely to get in trouble for the usual black behavior.</p>
