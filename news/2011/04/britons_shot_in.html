<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>James Cooper, 25, and James Kouzaris, 24, were in Florida when they were killed at 3am in a gangland area rarely visited by tourists.</p>
<p>They apparently accepted a lift from someone they met in a bar, thinking they were being driven home.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BritonsShot.jpg" src="/news/2011/04/19/BritonsShot.jpg" width="460" height="287" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>
<p>A 16 year-old, named locally as Shawn Tyson (left), was charged with their murder. It emerged yesterday that he was freed by a judge last week despite being arrested over an armed robbery.</p>
<p>The bodies of Mr Cooper, a tennis coach who once played Andy Murray, and Mr Kouzaris were found riddled with bullets on a one-way street in the estate, known for drug dealing and gang activity. Police are investigating the theory that the pair spent the night bar hopping in Sarasota.</p>
<p>Officers suspect they believed they were being driven the 12 miles to the resort of Longboat Key.</p>
<p>Instead, they were taken to Newtown, Sarasota, where they were confronted by a gang of masked men.</p>
<p>Police sources said both men were running away when they were shot. Their bodies were found 50ft apart. They still had money on them and police found no evidence to suggest they had been wanting to buy drugs.</p>
<p>Sarasota police chief Mikel Hollaway said detectives had their suspicions but it would be unfair to state them. He said he believed the victims were there of their own volition.</p>
<p>Captain Paul Sutton said police were looking at the possibility of more arrests. He said: &#8220;More than one person ran when shots were fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>A police source said the two friends did not have their own transport, &#8220;so they were brought to this location&#8221;. He said: &#8220;Someone could have called ahead and people were waiting for them.&#8221; Sonja Seymour, 31, of Newtown, said: &#8220;I heard that when they arrived here there were already some people waiting for them. They were wearing masks. The men ran away and they were shot. I saw one of them lying in the street on his back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said the 16-year-old boy, charged with double murder, was believed to live with his mother in the housing estate.</p>
<p>He had been charged with aggravated assault after shots were fired in an attempted robbery two weeks ago.</p>
<p>However, he was released while police carried out further inquiries.</p>
<p>Police said he would now be charged as an adult which could lead to the death penalty.</p>
<p>The pair met at Sheffield University and became firm friends. Mr Cooper, who graduated in economics and business management, had gone to stay with his parents, Stan and Sandra, at Longboat Key in a Â£300 a week apartment.</p>
<p>Mr Kouzaris, a keen runner, cyclist and rugby player, had spent several months travelling around South America.</p>
<p>Mr Walton said his grandson was excited about the holiday. &#8220;The boys went out in Florida on Friday evening as young men do  &mdash;  but they didn&rsquo;t come back. As it was late his mother rang his mobile and got no answer. She carried on ringing. Eventually a policeman answered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came to get Sandra and his dad and took them down to the police station, and only then did they tell them that the boys had been shot and killed. Sandra is shattered, as are we.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gina Cross, 31, of Florida, said she was hoping to see Mr Cooper the day he died. She first met the pair when they visited Florida in April 2009. They met for drinks last Thursday night and were to see each other on Saturday. She said: &#8220;They were so excited to come here. James said to me: &#8216;I&rsquo;m so looking forward to seeing you.&rsquo; Then all of a sudden, one moment in time can change everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m heartbroken, I&rsquo;ve spent all week telling my friends what a great guy James is. It was the start of something special.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Roe, head coach at Kenilworth Tennis, Squash and Croquet Club, where Mr Cooper, an only child, had been a member most of his life, said: &#8220;He was an excellent tennis player as a teenager and became my doubles partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was an outstanding coach. There wasn&rsquo;t much work over Easter so he took some time off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Cooper, a season ticket holder at Coventry City, lived with his parents in a gated barn conversion in Hampton Lucy, near Warwick.</p>
<p>Mr Kouzaris also lived with his parents, Hazel, and Peter, both 52, in Northampton. He has a sister, Emily, 20. They described him as a &#8220;wonderful son&#8221;.</p>
<p>His aunt, Carole Kouzaris, of Syston, Leics, said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s absolutely horrific.</p>
<p>&#8220;James was a lovely lad, popular, good-looking and adventurous.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Why in Lord&rsquo;s name would anyone get into a car with a stranger?  ANY STRANGER!  And even worse why would they get in a car with a black male?  Did they think they could take him if trouble started.  As I always tell my teenage nephews I don&rsquo;t care how tough you are a gun beats a fist every time!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the gang initiation theory, but no article ever mentions race.  Is the initiation that you must murder whites?  If so then more liberal lies are being exposed. Leftists have long denied that blacks actively target whites for murder and any white that believes so is a paranoid racist.  White people need to decide if this is the sort of society we want, I know my answer. </p>

		<p>Claiming the white victims of black crime wanted to buy drugs   &mdash;   The ghetto excuse-ologists trot that one out every time one of these kinds of crimes happen.  Too bad that neither victim&rsquo;s life history nor any Sarasota Police-gathered evidence on investigation suggest any hint of this being true.</p>
<p>The first version of this story in the Daily Mail was a three-part spread, the third part being a long neo-liberal diatribe from a former British Consulate bureaucrat who was once stationed in Florida.  In it, he bemoaned the fact that in many American cities, you can go from wealthy, opulent and white to poor, ghetto and black just by crossing a street.  Of course, he ought not throw stones from inside a glass house   &mdash;   It&rsquo;s not like London doesn&rsquo;t have any hard core black ghettos.  The only reason why it&rsquo;s not possible to go from rich white to poor black in the matter of a few hundred yards is that British class consciousness manifested itself in neighborhoods, and what are now black ghettos used to be poor white neighborhoods, which were never close to the rich white neighborhoods anyway.</p>

		<p>These two young men had everything to look forward to. By all accounts, they were the sort anyone would enjoy having for a friend or fellow. Tragic it is but the word tragic is not strong enough.</p>
<p>They were not murdered&hellip;.they were executed, being guilty of but one crime&hellip;.white privilege&hellip;and for that crime, they gave their lives and part of the lives of everyone who knew them or would ever know them. </p>

		<p>In our &#8220;lurid&#8221; (per Heidi B.) Whites Only fantasies, we imagine funding of a group of stealth speakers on campuses who teach multicultural understanding, but include lots of pictures of Whites juxtaposed with their afrovoodooo black killers.  A few Whiteys in the audience would get the message.  And we can have a some  plants in the audience asking questions about why the civil rights leaders and icons have failed to convince &#8220;their people&#8221; to stop robbing, raping, and murdering &#8220;our people.&#8221;    Asking why saying Diversity is our strength doesn&rsquo;t seem to make it come true. Ask why Eve Carson&rsquo;s dabbling in the Diversity Housing Initiative at UNC didn&rsquo;t protect her from Death by Diversity?</p>
<p>We suspect there is a huge and growing market among our White Youth for the mainstreaming of this race-sensitive rhetoric.</p>
<p>Time to stop blaming ourselves for our enemies&rsquo; failures.</p>
<p>Time to call to account the Whitey college professors who teach Ethical Understanding and demand that we see the good in our enemies and the evil in ourselves.</p>
<p>Time for all of us to embrace the White Nurse Syndrome.</p>

		<p>Two more naive victims killed by their diversity indoctrination.  Led to believe that blacks are different only in skin color and are nice, &#8220;good boys&#8221; only wanting to be accepted for the &#8220;content of their character&#8221;.  I agree with the last part.  We SHOULD accept all blacks based on the &#8220;content of their character&#8221;&hellip;..which is jungle savagery, pack attacks, hatred of whites, contempt for life in general, having IQ&rsquo;s on the retard level but in pumped up men&rsquo;s bodies carrying guns driven by hatred and innate violence.</p>

		<p>Liberalism and the fear of being called &#8220;racist&#8221; have taught many whites to engage in stupid suicidal acts.  Acts that would have been unthinkable prior to the 1950s. I suspect these Brits were looking for drugs.</p>
<p>And one more thing.  The judge that let this kid out of jail two weeks prior should be forced to serve the murderer&rsquo;s sentence concurrently.  In a saner world the two would be forced to share the same cell&hellip;until their one appeal was exhausted and they finally met the hangman.</p>

<p>Of course he was released last week by a judge.</p>
<p>He was black, therefore, let em go.</p>
<p>He &#8220;only&#8221; committed armed robbery. No big deal if one is black.</p>
<p>Why not release the thug, now a murderer. Too bad the judge cannot be sued by this family and sent to prison for his part as an &#8220;accessory&#8221; in the murder case.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gay ( and VERY conservative ) and in my opinion I think those two were gay and were out looking for some &#8216;jungle love&rsquo;. You&rsquo;d be amazed how common that is with gay men with many of them meeting the same fate. Of course when I try to warn them I&rsquo;m accused of being racist.<br>
I&rsquo;m constantly approached by black men for sex and when I rebuff them they say &#8220;whats the matter, you don&rsquo;t like black men&#8221;? My answer to them is &#8220;no, do you&#8221;?  </p>

		<p>One of the first things I taught my kids when they went off into the wilds of America on their own was the real and present danger of diversity.  It angers me that Western countries are plagued with bureaucrats who don&rsquo;t give a hoot about their law-abiding citizens.  So many white parents are lacking the prudent judgment of warning their children about the genuine threat of the black male, with an inner-city black female coming in a close second. I am outraged at the loss of these two vibrant young white men but realize there will be many more in the years to come.  And, to think all this could have been prevented with a simple, honest &#8220;talk.&#8221;  I am sure the parents would be outraged by my words but the chances are their sons would never have left the comfy confines of &#8220;tourist&#8221; Sarasota had they all thought like me.</p>
<p>And, that judge!  Boy, oh boy, that judge&hellip;..<br>

		<p>A good 75% of the black population in America are likely sociopaths. They have little sense of &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;wrong&#8221; and less of a sense of empathy and compassion. Often, their motives are entirely ulterior. Keep that in mind, always. </p>

		<p>@3 Anonymous, I think you jumped the gun here; I don&rsquo;t think this unfortunate pair were gay. They could have been lured into the vehicle in many other ways: drugs, whores, an after hours bar, or simply a cheap taxi ride to their destination. The bottom line is that they were trusting, deluded White liberals who paid the ultimate price for their diversity and tolerance. <br>
    You can bet the British press is going to &#8220;blame whitey&#8221; on this one yet again. American climate of violence; no gun control; legacy of slavery, striking out against racism&hellip;.yes, I can read it now </p>

		<p>Gang Initiation. In my suburban neighborhood, in a Southern US city, we had an incident two years ago that police described as a &#8220;gang initiation&#8221;. A neighbor was out cutting his grass, when a car pulled up and three black kids jumped out. They ran over and began punching and kicking him, took his wallet, jumped back into the car, and roared off. </p>
<p>There, up the road about four miles, lies this other world, full of semi-retarded thugs, who can occasionally reach down into our quiet neighborhood and badly mess with us. Can&rsquo;t say I much like it.</p>

		<p>Yes. it&rsquo;s possible they were gay, but that&rsquo;s beside the point. What they were, obviously, was liberal, believing that we&rsquo;re all the same, race is only skin deep, blah, blah, blah. And yes, they may have felt that White Americans are all racists, America practiced slavery in the past, poor down-trodden blacks being held back by the White man, blah, blah, blah. </p>
<p>That being said, I don&rsquo;t even care if they went to buy drugs, they didn&rsquo;t deserve what they got. </p>
<p>And now let me tell you about my little encounter in the sixties when I was young, liberal, stupid, and living in Spain. For a while I was hanging out with some military families. One night we were out at a club and some black military guys who had a jazz group were performing on stage and they were pretty good. Some of the people I was with knew them so afterwards they sat down with us. To make a long story short, when it was time to go one of the black musicians said he would drive me home. </p>
<p>We get in the car and the next thing you know we&rsquo;re speeding down some unknown highway and this guy is telling me how much he wants me and he&rsquo;s going to take me somewhere and he&rsquo;s going to get what he wants. At that point I open the car door and tell him I&rsquo;m going to jump. (We were doing about 60 mph.) At first he didn&rsquo;t believe me, but when he saw I meant it, he came to his senses and drove me home. </p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re asking - Would I have really jumped? Darned right I would have!!!  </p>
<p>I never forgot it. I think the only that stopped him is the thought that he could have been charged with murder if I had junped out and died. </p>
<p>I can still picture him to this day.   </p>

<i>&#8220;Police sources said both men were running away when they were shot. Their bodies were found 50ft apart. They still had money on them and police found no evidence to suggest they had been wanting to buy drugs.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why these two were where they were and why. Drugs, sex, drugs and sex? Promises and lies? Only Shawn can tell us. Maybe the facts will come out at trial. Who knows.</p>
<p>What I do know is that these young men were too trusting, naive, and ignorant of the dangers blacks pose.</p>
<p>I would speculate that this is because they have been taught NOT to judge blacks in any way, shape, or form because that&rsquo;s racist. They were likely taught to dismiss their life-saving instincts lest they think of themselves as racists and bigots.</p>
<p>Then there are the movies and rap videos. Shawn sure fits the image of a rap video gagsta. Maybe these guys even felt honored in away to be in the presence an authentic gagsta just like in those awesome rap videos.</p>
<p>Shawn saw easy marks. The proverbial &#8216;lambs to the slaughter&rsquo;. </p>
<p>By being lied to and having their survival skills short circuited by &#8216;anti-hate&rsquo; propaganda, they were defenseless and they paid the price.</p>

They met for drinks last Thursday night and were to see each other on Saturday. She said: &ldquo;They were so excited to come here.

		<p>I just had a White working class/musician friend (60 yrs old) come back from the winter spent in South Florida. He&rsquo;s a bit of a hippy type and has been living on the margins, streets for a couple of decades.</p>
<p>He says that South Florida was good for him and there are very clear divisions between the races with American ghetto Blacks on the bottom - others try to help each other and it&rsquo;s OK to be White and not have a place to stay - there are hostels, rich folks willing to give work to our kind.</p>
<p>Brutal murders like this are indeed terrible, but they serve to educate the public (world wide) about racial realities and the need for our people to look out for our people.</p>
<p><br>
So whenever you see foreign White tourists in your area - look out for them. Make sure they have safe transportation and that they avoid going to certain places and certain times of the day and night.</p>
<p>This is called &#8220;kindness&#8221; - being kind to our own kind.</p>

		<p>I just saw a report on the news that showed these two poor souls on video inside the club talking to two different sets of women, who they are now looking for hoping they can shed some light on what their plans were for later. I don&rsquo;t think they were gay, nor do I think that had anything to do with their murder. It still seems to be a mystery as to why they were in the ghetto in the first place, as cops have ruled out drugs. There is a a lot of conflicting information on this story, but regardless.. how tragic&hellip; </p>

		<p>Weed, sex  (whatever variety), drugs, the appeal of ghetto excitement, or whatever&hellip; we can be sure these young men, sufficiently liquored up,  weren&rsquo;t out there gallivanting at that hour with ghetto thugs   &mdash;   <b><i>&#8220;at 3am in a gangland area rarely visited by tourists&#8221; </i>  &mdash;   </b> because they were on their way to church!</p>
<p>As was mentioned by someone above, this will be blamed in Britain on American gun culture, white racism, lack of gun control,  the legacy of slavery &hellip; and all the popular, worn-out excuses that the leftist press rely on.  But the blame lies  really in Britain itself.  These adventure-seeking young men hadn&rsquo;t a clue about American racial realities (and doubtless thought themselves above such nonsense).  After a lifetime of socialist brainwashing about inter-racial harmony and blah blah, they must have thought they were going with this thug to hang out with his buddies  and sing Kumbaya in the ghetto.  Sadly, they got more than they bargained for. It was predictable.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there have been other stories in the news, over the years now, about other  <b>naive, trusting European tourists </b>, equally clueless,  who have been murdered by blacks in Florida. They were doubtless very  proud and self-righteous about their lack of racial &#8220;predjudice&#8221; and wanted to demonstrate their lack of racial feeling and their love for other races.  The blacks felt otherwise and shared no such notions!   This  latest killing is nothing new.</p>

<p>Follow Up:  The suspect was not even out of jail 12 hours before he allegedly murdered these two Brits.  He was being held for a previous shooting, but thanks to the &#8220;stop snitching&#8221; crowd, they had to let him out of jail because of no evidence.</p>

<p>This does bring up an interesting point: is there a political implication to such killings? Are they are form of low level ethnic cleansing, motivated by the non-stop anti-White propaganda which is pushed across the boards? Are these killings related in spirit to the farm attacks in the rainbow nation of new South Africa?</p>
<p>Consider how Whites are demonized. Do (alleged) killers such as this Shawn fellow see their victims as exploiters, slavers, and worst of all, racists? And thus he is striking a blow for freedom?</p>
<p>It would be interesting if someone would investigate these cases and delve into the motivations of the perpetrators.</p>

		<p>Poster #15. I remember when my Mom lived down in Sarasota with her late boyfriend. I would fly from here in cold NE Ohio &amp; be blessed with the warm sunshine for a week or two. This was back in &#8216;94 &&rsquo;95. The area was overwhelmingly Euro-American, golden-agers, very few blacks. A few older blacks who would walk around the Sarasota mall, and were very pleasant. I am in my mid thirties so I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot before the &rsquo;70s, but it seems that black seniors are happier and a lot were married and stayed together. With the erosion of family life in the black population enters the erosion of moral standards. See the connection?</p>

		<p>As a Briton myself this crime doesn&rsquo;t surprise me since its becoming more common in the UK as well (although mainly black on black).</p>
<p>However I will say Hollywood plays a big part in shaping white opinions of blacks. Constantly portraying black Americans super positively if one thinks of all the Denzel Washington, Will Smith etc movies.</p>

So to THIS DAY Florida has had to pay police officers to just sit at rest areas all day because of black crime. I wonder how much thats cost the taxpayers of that state over 10 years?<br>

<p>Shame on you.</p>
<p>These were two decent men who were murdered, they do not deserve to be mocked for being British and they do not deserve to be accused of being drug users. For the record, as British visitors, they would have no idea of where a ghetto was, or even that one existed in Sarasota, so they certainly would not have chosen to travel there &#8216;looking for drugs&rsquo;. In fact, everything we know about them shows then as clean living, non drug taking types.</p>

I&rsquo;m gay ( and VERY conservative ) and in my opinion I think those two were gay and were out looking for some &lsquo;jungle love&rsquo;. You&rsquo;d be amazed how common that is with gay men with many of them meeting the same fate. Of course when I try to warn them I&rsquo;m accused of being racist.<br>
I&rsquo;m constantly approached by black men for sex and when I rebuff them they say &ldquo;whats the matter, you don&rsquo;t like black men&rdquo;? My answer to them is &ldquo;no, do you&rdquo;? </p>
<p>I agree.  This happens all the time, yet the gay spokespersons are just as racist as the ADL.  They refuse to admit that black predators hunt and kill  gay Whites as much as they do other Whites.  Black predators gather around bars at closing time hoping to rob and rape Whites who have had too much too drink.</p>
<p>When I did patrol, I always stopped and questioned blacks hanging around bars.  Many had warrants and criminal records.  Good way to clear warrants and get credit for arrests.  Those who didn&rsquo;t have warrants out soon learned to stay out of my patrol area.<br>

<p>It was believed at first the two left with the perp but now after new information from detectives, it is believed they walked to go get something to eat late at night at a place close to the entertainment distict, which is common here in the USA too and I have done many times with friends. Anyways, they appeared to have accidentally ended up walking into the area where they were killed. This is understandable as they were not from the local area.</p>
