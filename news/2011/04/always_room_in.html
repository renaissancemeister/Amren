			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katherine Kersten, Star Tribune, April 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>These are tough times for Minnesota schools.</p>
<p>In Lakeville, for example, the school board recently announced wrenching cuts of almost $7 million. Ninety-four teachers will lose their jobs, arts programs will suffer and a school will be closed.</p>
<p>There was wailing and gnashing of teeth, but the board set its jaw: There&rsquo;s not a dime for anything extra.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve got an ax to grind with white folks. Then the money spigots open.</p>
<p>The Lakeville schools are sending a delegation of teachers to the 12th annual &#8220;White Privilege Conference&#8221; at the Bloomington Sheraton from Aug. 13-16. The district is shelling out $160 a pop  &mdash;  plus $125 a day for teacher subs  &mdash;  for this &#8220;white guilt&#8221; festival.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The conference is &#8220;built on the premise that the U.S. was started by white people, for white people,&#8221; according to conference materials. Its mission is to get participants to confront their biases in a &#8220;journey in understanding white supremacy, whiteness, privilege, power and oppression,&#8221; and to &#8220;agree to take action in [their] own circle of power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference is sponsored by the Minnesota Justice Collaborative, a consortium of local higher-education and philanthropic institutions. It is expected to draw 1,500 teachers, students, activists, artists, social workers and counselors from more than 40 states. Minnesota public schools are represented on the list of speakers and workshop presenters.</p>
<p>What can Lakeville parents and taxpayers expect for their investment?</p>
<p>To find out, we can peruse the keynote address for the 2009 conference. It was delivered by &#8220;social justice educator&#8221; Paul Kivel and appeared in the conference journal, &#8220;Understanding and Dismantling Privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kivel begins with what passes these days as a prayer: &#8220;I want to acknowledge the creative spirits in the world that nurture and sustain us and that connect us to each other and to the plant and animal life around us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he winds up for a fire-and-brimstone sermon. We Americans &#8220;are completely dependent on U.S. imperialism and war to sustain our daily lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our schools, too, are riddled with racial bias. &#8220;Our school system has been set up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to perpetuate white supremacy and white privilege.&#8221; Poor and minority students &#8220;do not drop out  &mdash;  they are pushed out.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gone wrong? For one thing, Christianity has far too much influence. It &#8220;has played a key role in developing and justifying sources of oppression&#8221; such as &#8220;violence and genocide,&#8221; Kivel tells us, and is &#8220;the beginning of modern or biological racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t despair, he counsels. We must look beyond our &#8220;declining empire&#8221; to &#8220;exciting progressive developments&#8221; in Hugo Chavez&rsquo;s Venezuela  &mdash;  among them, &#8220;land reform and redistribution of wealth, neighborhood committees, recognition of women&rsquo;s unpaid labor, end of spanking.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At this year&rsquo;s conference, participants can look forward to a tongue-lashing from Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, author of &#8220;Outlaw Woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clamor&#8221; magazine describes Dunbar-Ortiz as &#8220;a fiery, indefatigable public speaker&#8221; on issues of capitalism and imperialism who cut her teeth in Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade, then built &#8220;associations with other revolutionaries across the spectrum of radical and underground politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to drinking in Dunbar-Ortiz&rsquo;s wisdom, Lakeville teachers {snip} can sample workshops where participants will &#8220;discuss how white privilege, white supremacy, and oppression affects daily life.&#8221; Every grievance get its due, with topics including not just skin color but sexuality, gender, class and disability.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whom should we thank for this rich smorgasbord of white guilt? Sponsors include the University of Minnesota, MnSCU, the St. Paul Foundation, Hamline University, Gustavus Adolphus College, the YWCA of Minneapolis and Augsburg College, among others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The website reported: &#8220;There&rsquo;s always the possibility that the &#8216;haters,&rsquo; as one of the organizers puts it, will descend in mass and try to disrupt peaceful discussions about the advantages of being white in America and the oppression that has led to.&#8221;</p>

Ms. Kersten does an excellent job of exposing the Marxist agenda. </p>
<p>I went to the original article to read the comments and they are disturbing. Overwhelmingly they attack Ms. Kersten and her assessment of this conference.</p>
<p>I had hoped to read comments in support of Ms. Kersten but most of them attack her as a kind of paranoid Conservative apologist. Many seem to follow her regularly and don&rsquo;t like her political views.</p>

		<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>Whites should not be involved in public education as that is the sole remaining bastion of the &#8216;if you can&rsquo;t do, teach!&rsquo; brigades control over black, hispanic and asian childrens&rsquo; faltering minds.</p>
<p>Let our children be taken back into our embrace with small block-education schools in housing developments and massive reinvestment in highly selective itinerant teacher groups who are _well paid_ to spend an entire &#8216;school day&rsquo; teaching their students to excel in 1-2 subjects, saturating them to expose native strengths and weaknesses rather than quick-dipping like education was a french fry cooker.</p>
<p>Add in electronic and online education so that kids may continue to practice at home while auditing and then, if skilled enough, _taking_ collegiate level courses by the time they are in middle school.</p>
<p>And a system which provides matching local and corporate scholarship packages so that _when not if_ AA fails, there is a real educated class to fall back on in saving whatever is left of our society.</p>
<p>Did we do this in just a few neighborhoods, commiting a paltry few thousand dollars to converting stay-at-home parents basements to schoolhouses rather than the MILLIONS on cement blockhouse &#8216;institutions&rsquo; we call public schooling in general, we could make it clear that whites _earn_ their privilege and other ethnies&rsquo; parasitism need not and should not be ours to fund with tax dollars.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s here it for the anti-racists and their rhetoric!</p>
<p>A few more ingrates like this and we can all look forward to the day when our voucher for the kind of classical, Western, education we want our kids to have leaves ALL the public schools emptied of white children.</p>
<p>And then those black Somali &#8216;refugees&rsquo; and Mexican high school dropouts can slit each other&rsquo;s throats rather than sabotaging our future.</p>
<p>And nobody in China or Europe will so much as bat an eyebrow.</p>

		<p>All this sounds very familiar to the hey days of Communist China&rsquo;s brainwashing techniques of its intellectuals and anyone else.  This country has definitely gone over the cliff in falling victim to PURE nonsense.  Another craziness in causing this country to regress from its previous forward march towards seeking progress and truth.  Due to white superior genes and hard work, a superior civilization was built which now peoples of color think they have an automatic right to its fruits.    </p>

		<p>Well, it starts out well enough:  &#8220;The conference is &ldquo;built on the premise that the U.S. was started by white people, for white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is true.  And the troubles started when that idea was trampled upon by the white liberal elite, against the wishes of the vast majority.<br>

		<p> Yes, there IS a chance   &mdash;   no, a probability   &mdash;   that some of us &#8220;haters,&#8221; as these pointy-heads are pleased to call us, will be there with bells on.</p>
<p> Mr. Jared Taylor and others, including Yours Truly, have posted on this website urging those who agree with us to attend the various &#8220;White guilt&#8221; pity parties for non-whites, not to disrupt them as they love to do to OUR conferences and programs, but to simply bring up things that will be inconvenient and embarrassing for the Left.</p>
<p> Unlike the multi-culti crowd, we don&rsquo;t try to keep our opponents from being heard. We just confront them and make them try to justify the nonsense they&rsquo;re spewing. </p>

		<p>The Marxists just can&rsquo;t help themselves.  Now not only is it &#8220;whiteness&#8221; that contributes to the evils of the world, it is also Christianity (which is practiced by all races) and capitalism (which is likewise seen around the globe.</p>
<p>I would go if I could.  If questions are fielded an AmRener should hit them hard:<br>
 &#8220;Since white privelege is apparently still occuring despite fifty-plus years of liberal civil rights laws and progressive Supreme Court rulings, what more can we do?  Should those most-harmed-blacks, Mexicans, Asians, non-Christians, and non-capitalists-be removed from the United States so that they can get away from the evil white privelege that is holding them back?  What would be the most humane way to do this?&#8221;</p>

		<p>If the victims of white oppression would seek segregation and emigration, they would have some credibility. Instead, we see them following the white man wherever he goes. There is a perfect inverse correlation between quality of life and the presence of blacks. It is universal and timeless.<br>

		<p>Minnesota is huge on this stuff, precisely because it us so white here. There is a ton of white &#8220;privilege&#8221; here, but in real life this is because it&rsquo;s a place where Nordic values still exist and receive their just reward. These values can be taught from childhood, but are lost on older kids who never learned them.  High achieving schools here have involved parents who read to their kids. It&rsquo;s really not that complicated.  </p>

 <br>
Minnesota is 85.6 percent white, and 4.5 percent black. <br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota</a> <br>
 <br>
In his book The Emerging Republican Majority, published in 1969, Kevin Phillips wrote that when the black population of a state is less than 10 percent it has little effect on the political behavior of the whites. When the black percentage exceeds 10 percent whites get nervous. When it reaches 50 percent the control of those blacks is the issue nearly all whites agree on.<br>
 <br>
It is easy to have a benign attitude toward blacks when one has contact with few of them. This is particularly true now, when television programs and Hollywood movies portray them favorably. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think the whole system needs to fail. It&rsquo;s easy for people to feel guilty when they are warm, safe and well fed but when a person is hungry, cold and fighting for survival all those feeling of guilt just sort of disappear.</p>
<p>Our ancestor may have built this country for white people but it wasn&rsquo;t given to them they had to earn it. They put a lot of sweat and even blood into the building of this country. They knew they earned what they had so they didn&rsquo;t feel guilty at all. </p>

		<p>Some items worth mentioning:</p>
<p>If this highly political conference is paid for with tax payers&rsquo; money, should not the &ldquo;Fairness Doctrine&rdquo; have some impact or come into being?  Where is the opposite point of view?  Now, I am aware that NPR has been spouting and spewing anti-European American/European propaganda for some time, with no rebuttal from the racially minded European American/European standpoint, and, still, does happen to be funded with tax payers&rsquo; funds.  But with state funds being spent for this conference and with its highly anti-European American/European political nature and agenda, there should be a rebuttal.  </p>
<p>I would like to see a racial composition of the 94 teachers losing their positions.  I would bet the vast majority of these teachers are of European American/European descent.  So, then tell us about &ldquo;White Privilege&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also, I would venture to state that many of those speaking are kin to the Affirmative Action family.  Other individuals/speakers probably make a lucrative living slamming, criticizing, and attacking the European American/European race and mindset (in other words, us). </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s most disturbing to me is that in repeated efforts, court cases, hearings, polls, rulings, elections, etc. the liberal, nonsensical, genocidal, mentality seems to overwhelmingly come out in the majority. It&rsquo;s evident to me that we, as patriots and conservatives truly are outnumbered now. The tipping point has indeed been reached; the momentum has swung full force in the direction of destruction. We scream, holler, and protest full force, and there&rsquo;s fewer and fewer of us to do it, and even fewer that listen.  I will continue to keep hope alive, but the almost assured impending death of what I knew as my homeland is heartbreaking.</p>

		<p>I wish these marxist types could finally get their way and banish all the white people (me included) to someplace far away where we couldnt do any more damage to the other races. Us blue eyed devils would have to make do, without the blessings of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.. that would sure show us!! Imagine the empire we could again create without the hindrance of the others dragging us down. Imagine the beauty of our pure line of white women! </p>
<p>It would take 100 years, and invariably we would be invaded for &#8216;excluding&rsquo; the rest of them&hellip;. such is our burden. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;built on the premise that the U.S. was started by white people, for white people&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask these &#8220;White Privlege&#8221; clowns to simply show me One, just ONE example in the entire history of the world where one group of people struggled, fought for and &#8220;started&#8221; a nation with the idea in mind that it should be for the benefit of anyone but themselves?</p>
<p>China? Nope<br>
Japan? Nope<br>
Somalia? Nope<br>
Mexico? Nope<br>
Etc, Etc&hellip;..</p>
<p>That premise = Epic Fail!</p>

		<p>John E is right.</p>
<p>At my university I notice a difference of black behavior due to their percentages of the group.  When in settings where whites are the overwhelming majority (class rooms, school sporting events [yes, most ticket payers are whites with money], specific bars of nearly all white) blacks are more reserved, calm, and less likely to cause trouble.</p>
<p>However, in areas where blacks are more numerous, they become loud, aggressive, and unbearable.  Whites who interact with blacks, at least subconsciously, develop an unease that noticeably changes their behavior.  They will be unlikely to play a pick-up basketball game with blacks when they know the blacks will bicker until they get there way.  Bars that have a certain percentage of black patrons will be less likely to have racially-conscious whites. </p>

		<p>The keynote address for a conference on &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is being given by a white male. Too hilarious. </p>
<p>These people are so quick to nose around in everyone&rsquo;s personal life, demanding that everyone change to suit the latest fashions trickling out of academia and down onto the rest of us, but do they have an ounce of self-consciousness, a shred of self-awareness of their hypocrisies and double-standards, such as having a white guy give their keynote address? Of course not. The regime they&rsquo;d like to impose isn&rsquo;t concerned in what they themselves are up to - it&rsquo;s about what YOU are up to.</p>

		<p>29 Greg: I noticed the same thing about Black behavior varying according to their numbers when I was in the service.  At 10 %, no problem.  At 20 % you needed to keep an eye on them, and at 30 %, they were out of control.  That&rsquo;s why so many Whites can be blind to racial reality.  The three blacks they know on the job aren&rsquo;t very good, but their not full time jivesters either.  They call it &#8220;acting White&#8221;.  </p>
