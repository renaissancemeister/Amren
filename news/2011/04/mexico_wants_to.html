			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS News, April 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>CBS News has learned that the Mexican Government has retained an American law firm to explore filing civil charges against U.S. gun manufacturers and distributors over the flood of guns crossing the border into Mexico.</p>
<p>Sources say Mexico&rsquo;s frustration with U.S. efforts to stop the flow of weapons has pushed them into this novel approach. The law firm is looking at charges that may include civil RICO. The contract was signed on November 2, 2010 by a representative of Mexico&rsquo;s Attorney General, at their Washington embassy.</p>
<p>On November 5, 2010 President Felipe Calderon expressed his frustration to CBS News correspondent Peter Greenberg: &#8220;We seized more than 90,000 weapons &hellip; I am talking like 50,000 assault weapons, AR-15 machine guns, more than 8,000 grenades and almost 10 million bullets. Amazing figures and according to all those cases, the ones we are able to track, most of these are American weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Mexican government database, there were 15,273 drug-related killings in 2010.Overall, a total of 34,612 people have died in drug-related killings in the four years since Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared a stepped-up offensive against drug cartels.</p>

		<p>We know this won&rsquo;t go anywhere.  Aside from the obvious reason that the premise isn&rsquo;t true, the Obama White House will do everything to stop it, because Obama&rsquo;s ATF is in the process of dragging its heels on Darrel Issa&rsquo;s investigation of Operation Gun Walker that Issa is this close to handing out contempt citations.  If this lawsuit happens, there will be a lot of things that come out &#8220;in the wash&#8221; that a lot of people want to keep covered up.</p>
<p>But think about the ramifications if Mexico is able to file this suit and win   &mdash;   Could the Federal courts issue a consent decree ordering the Feds to build a border wall and fortify it with the 101st Airborne, to keep Mexico safe from America&rsquo;s guns?  Talk about don&rsquo;t throw me into the briar patch.</p>

<p>Liar!</p>
<p>The AR-15 is not in demand by the cartels, because it is only semi-automatic, not automatic.  Does anyone but the gun illiterates think the cartels with unlimited funds are going to buy second rate AR-15&rsquo;s over fully automatic M-16&rsquo;s and AK-47&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>And how many people think the gun stores here are selling hand grenades?</p>
<p>The majority of cartel weapons come from the black market, the Mexican military and police and the leftovers from the many wars in Central and South America.<br>

		<p>This is a remarkable new legal principle.  Someone who manufactures a legal product in the US, distributes it in compliance with US federal and state laws, through retailers fully licensed federally and by those states, can now be sued for possibly illegal use of that product?</p>
<p>I suppose the manufacturers of motor vehicles used in the smuggling of drugs into and out of Mexico should now also be liable because their cars and trucks were used in the process.<br>
Hey, and what about aircraft?  Beechcraft, Cessna, Piper, Grumman, etc should be next in line to be found liable.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>If those numbers are added up, the figure would still be abut 45 million short of the number of ILLEGAL ALIENS from South of the Border. And if the weapons are indeed from America, I suspect they came from America to the Mexican criminals VIA the Mexican Army! Also, to my knowledge at least, AK-47s are not made in the U.S. and I have seen plenty of those South of the Burder in my past down there.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I was in San Diego on a business trip.</p>
<p>The day I arrived a New Corvette was stolen off a parking lot.</p>
<p>The San Diego Police located the car, within a week.</p>
<p>It was being driven by the Chief Of Police in T.J. he said he could not return it because it was now evidence in a crime.</p>
<p>Herein lies your answer, they don&rsquo;t take advantage of us, our own people sell us down the road to destruction to line their own pockets, don&rsquo;t you get that yet?</p>

		<p>&#8220;the ones we are able to track, most of these are American weapons.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the key sentence, the ones they could &#8216;track&rsquo;.  I read a report that said the majority of the weapons coming into mexico are from non-U.S. suppliers.  The only reason some weapons can be tracked is because of strict U.S. gun laws.  The weapons the cartels get from Russia, Asia, South America and Africa, well you can&rsquo;t track those, and they are the majority of the weapons.</p>

		<p>Note to Mexico:</p>
<p>The advice of many experts outside your country is to avoid long term plans, because you won&rsquo;t be in power long enough to collect on a settlement even if the dopes in the US liberal courts decide to give you one.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to fill your back packs with pork and beans, along with a bedroll, and head out to the desert to hide until the cartels have finished their &#8220;adjustment&#8221; period, then ask them if you can come back.</p>
<p>You might even be able to get a job as a &#8220;mule&#8221; lugging bales of dope into the US.</p>

		<p>The cases isn&rsquo;t about guns it&rsquo;s about American sovereignty. People can laugh and call us &#8220;conspiracy nuts&#8221; all they want, but here it is. </p>
<p>This is how the New World Order will be built and borders rendered meaningless. This is not one government taking action against another it&rsquo;s one government taking action against a private company in another. The job of our government is to protect us from foreign governments, at least I thought it was anyway. </p>

		<p>The VAST majority of rifles used by the cartels are fully automatic.  The US DOES NOT manufacture fully automatic Ak-47&rsquo;s or M-16&rsquo;s that are available to the public.  </p>
<p>There might be a few semi-automatics picked up by the average Mexican crook that come from the US, but that&rsquo;s about it.  </p>
<p>There certainly isn&rsquo;t &#8220;thousands&#8221; that are sold and shipped to Mexico.  That&rsquo;s preposterous.</p>
