<h1>Amid Shutdown Drama, Rep. Brown Invites Lawmakers on a Boutique Shopping Trip</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christina Wilkie, The Hill, April 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With a government shutdown looming, Capitol Hill was a pretty serious place on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>But for Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), what better way to ease the tension than with a congressional ladies personal shopping trip in Arlington, Va.?</p>
<p>According to an email from Brown&rsquo;s scheduler titled, &#8220;Outing with Congresswoman Corrine Brown,&#8221; staff member Cathy Gass invited Brown&rsquo;s fellow female Congressional Black Caucus members to join the lawmaker at a boutique in Crystal City, Va. on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gass also suggests that for members who &#8220;would like to share [their] dress size, the boutique can pull some items for them to have available once they arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the ultra high-end service, pulling clothes that a client might like before they arrive is better known as personal shopping.</p>

		<p>Some white congressmembers are guilty of this as well, but what is it about the Congressional Black Caucus and their stick-in-the-eye mentality? </p>
<p>Are they not happy unless they are prancing around in designer, purple scarves and leopard-print clothes, being chaufered in limousines, shopping at the priciest boutiques, drinking champagne and eating at the finest D.C. restaurants?</p>
<p>You know Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas) is going to be there, as probably is Maxine Waters (D-Calif.)  &mdash;   the two most hateful and spite-filled black women on the planet!</p>
<p>In a time when so many are going without, these black congresswomen have to flout their status and privilege on the rest of the country, like African princesses. </p>
<p>Whether in the ghetto or in the halls of power, blacks know no shame. </p>

		<p> What government shutdown crisis? Sistuhs, we goin&rsquo; SHOPPIN&#8221;!</p>
<p> I presume the &#8220;ladies&#8221; chose and purchased some stunning outfits to wear when they stand in the well of the House to denounce the Republicans for &#8220;causing&#8221; the shutdown. Gots to look our best when de camera is on!</p>
<p> And here&rsquo;s a thought: What if a White congresswoman   &mdash;   especially a Republican one   &mdash;   had invited all the other WHITE congresswomen to go shopping with her at a top-of-the-line boutique, and specifically NOT invited any of the black congresswomen? Can you say, &#8220;Hatred!&#8221; and &#8220;White racism!&#8221;? The mainstream media most assuredly would. </p>

		<p>This is my representative in Congress.  It was just released that she spends 8 thousand dollars a year on bottled water for her office, several times that of the next highest spender. Taxpayer money of course.  Perfect example of the culture of greed in our govt.</p>
<p>Her district is as gerrymandered as possible to ensure she will never lose, in fact she has run unopposed for the past several elections.  A few years back she got a tiny bit of heat for what appeared to be a bribery scandal.  Of course nothing came of it and she just keeps on raking in the money, for herself mainly.  </p>

<p><br>
Judging by Rep. Corrine Brown&rsquo;s super-snazzy Zebra-print get-up, I&rsquo;m guessing her own &#8220;personal shopper&#8221; is a Zulu with a spear. </p>

		<p>As long as her constituents keep voting for her and others like her all over this country, the abuse will continue. This is comparable to those who continue to elect Luis Guiterez even though he says &#8220;My only thoughts are for the immigrants (illegals). No accounting for taste.</p>

		<p>In college, we used to watch &#8216;Sanford &amp; Son&rsquo; reruns.  But I don&rsquo;t remember the episode where, apparently, Aunt Esther dresses up as one of Charlie&rsquo;s Angels. Maybe for Halloween?  The above photo is a Still from that episode I missed&hellip;.right?</p>
<p>So where does the Men-Only group from the Congressional WHITE Caucus go on their outings?</p>

		<p>I have no problem with paying for quality.  I have no problem with them living well on what they are legitimately paid.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The current salary (2011) for rank-and-file members of the House and Senate is $174,000 per year.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/QIYSc</p>
<p>This is not legitimate payment for the kind of responsibility our representatives must shoulder.  And because of that &#8216;all glitter, no gold&rsquo; lack of reward as incentive, I am sure that we get a lower breed of huckster.</p>
<p>As such, I feel like I am watching a &#8216;lifestyles of the rich and shameless&rsquo; exhibition whenever I see a story like this and it feels sordid _because I am reducing myself to the level of voyeur_.</p>
<p>What pisses me off about Congress is the certainty that 90% of the legislation which goes through the Senate is _undebated_ because it is _unseen_ &#8216;being resolved in committee&rsquo; and voted in-absentia by aides.</p>
<p>I frankly see no reason for there to be so much legislation required in a given year that our Senators and Representatives should feel saturated by it.</p>
<p>And what REALLY tears it for me is that the stuff which gets the most public expose` coverage is so tediously pointless.  Not immigration.  Not race apportionment by decree.  Not IQ and genetics.  Not crime.  Not even the utter absurdity of flying support missions for other people&rsquo;s wars using jets which burn as much fuel in a single mission as _my car_ did in FOUR YEARS worth of driving.  At a time when the Saudis are finally admitting they overvalued their reserves and we are within 5 years of hitting the backend of petroleum production.</p>
<p>I do not care what your fashion tastes are Mz. Brown.  Just do your damn job and make it count for something.</p>

		<p>This is not really surprising as it is definitely a Black Thing. When the &#8220;refugees&#8221; were moved out of New Orleans to Texas after Katrina they were given debit cards pre-loaded with (I believe) several thousand dollars. How many reports were there of these people using these cards to buy clothing, jewelry, and all kind of useless junk. Never mind whites will take care of the house and food.</p>

		<p>Rep Brown&rsquo;s look has me nostalgic for the 70s. Perhaps she also needs a fashion consultant and a professional makeover?  I was under the assumption that Congress doesn&rsquo;t get paid in the event of a government shutdown? </p>
