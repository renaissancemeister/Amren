<h1>Not &#8216;A Mile&rsquo; of Border Secure, Texas Sheriff Says</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Penny Starr, CNS News (Cybercast News Service), April 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Texas Sheriff Tomas Herrera said he does not agree with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano&rsquo;s assessment of security at the U.S.-Mexico border as being &#8220;better than it has ever been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herrera, in a telephone interview with CNSNews.com, said that not &#8220;a mile&#8221; of the 85-mile stretch of border in Maverick County, Texas, which is separated from Mexico by the Rio Grande River, is secure and that the violence of Mexican drug cartels is spilling over into the United States as cartels come into Texas and kidnap teenagers for their smuggling operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;They come in and kidnap some of our citizens in this county and take them into Mexico,&#8221; Herrera told CNSNews.com. &#8220;We&rsquo;re talking about young kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are high school kiddos and junior high kids that are used by the cartels to smuggle drugs into the United States,&#8221; said Herrera, who has been in law enforcement for 37 years and sheriff of Maverick County for five.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the local paper in Eagle Pass, Texas, The News Gram, published a story on March 31 about a press conference held by the Eagle Pass Police Department and an official from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s regional office.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is perhaps one of the dirtiest secrets in Eagle Pass,&#8221; the article stated. &#8220;Young men and women kidnapped in our area and taken across the border, held for ransom or simply made to disappear.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whispers echo in high school gymnasiums, restaurants and churches and they all tell a sobering story  &mdash;  it happens and it happens often,&#8221; the article stated.</p>
<p>The law enforcement officials warned parents to tell their children about the dangers of associating with drug cartel members. In one case, still under investigation, a 17-year-old boy was picked up &#8220;and held captive in Mexico while his family collected enough money to pay a ransom,&#8221; the article stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chief of Police Tony Castaneda has made it publicly known that area teenagers are being targeted for initiation by Mexican drug cartels in what is quickly becoming a losing battle in the US /Mexico Drug War,&#8221; stated the article. {snip}</p>
<p>Herrera said that kidnappings aren&rsquo;t the only violence that is spilling over from Mexico. He said ranchers and other residents feel constantly threatened by drug cartel activity in the county.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ranchers up here are afraid to be out there by themselves,&#8221; Herrera said. &#8220;They are all armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Herrera said houses have been burglarized and even cattle stolen and transported across the river to Mexico.</p>
<p>Herrera said more manpower  &mdash;  &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221;  &mdash;  is needed to stem Mexican drug cartel violence, and if Napolitano comes to visit Maverick County he would show her what his department faces on a daily basis.</p>

		<p>Our betters seek to install a Central American style democracy that will be controlled by, of course, them. This system involves a popular vote for figureheads who then report to a handful of oligarchs such as, say, &lsquo;Mr. Fruit&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Mr. Beverage&rsquo;. $20 buys you access to the figureheads. Access to the oligarchs involves security pat-downs, armed guards, and the whole spooky deal.</p>
<p>The Central American system of government is the consequence of democracy with an electorate of an average IQ in the 80s. Wages in Central America range from $3-$8/day per worker. This is in contrast with US food stamp benefits of ~$20/day per household. Add in welfare, free medical care, charity, an unsecured border, and we have our southern border.</p>
<p>The American people do not benefit from this migration. It represents a burden on us by making life less fun, more dangerous, and more expensive. The people who benefit from this are the International Financial interests who like the lowered cost of labor, and perceive the Hispanics to be more controllable and less of a physical threat. </p>
<p>The modern American welfare state will collapse. When it does, perhaps we should consider limiting political empowerment to those stakeholders actively engaged in the economy, as was the case at America&rsquo;s Founding. This would establish an electorate strong enough to counter those forces of Wealth and Birth, who seek to control us.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Gang initiations are the province of ethnies.  Not whites = not our problem.</p>
<p>If whites are a part of this, it&rsquo;s for profit.  And only because they can go places hispanics cannot, without questioning and searches, crossing the border.  At which point they should be glad the Mexicans have them because I think they should be shot for being part of the drug business at all.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Herrera said that kidnappings aren&rsquo;t the only violence that is spilling over from Mexico. He said ranchers and other residents feel constantly threatened by drug cartel activity in the county.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Have a big family.  Have a footprint on the land.  Teach your children, your wife and you siblings if they&rsquo;ll stay to make a dynasty to defend what is theirs.  And back up your claims with sensorized proof as well as force.</p>
<p>The Mexicans win if they can prove we don&rsquo;t want the land more than they do.  Even if it&rsquo;s only a state-of-play LIE to justify opportunistic robbery on the way further north.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Herrera said that his sheriff&rsquo;s office only has 5 deputies per shift to patrol a county that is 1,249 square miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to try to secure 85 miles of river [along the border], you can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Herrera said.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Rubbish.  You keep your forces centralized and respond track the incursion from the breach to an intercept point with sensors and UAVs &#8216;patrolling&rsquo; is a great way to get ambushed or meeting engagement random attrited.</p>
<p>You also use your weapons to make crossing the border for whatever nefarious reason as painful a process as possible.  If Eagle Pass was too dangerous for Mexicans to breach with their sick drugs, they would go elsewhere.</p>
<p>The shorter a distance you have to drive to any one emergency (they all head for a highway, eventually), the easier it is to inflict attrition on multiples.  Just cuff&rsquo;em and come back for them as your UAVs and UGS sentry nets track the others.</p>
<p>The fact that (likely) hispanics are being taken from our side of the border is PROOF that the Mexican Drug War has been Villalized.</p>
<p>We cannot ostrich our heads any more.  We have to assume a certain responsibility for our own safety and property.  Because the Feds _will not_ protect us.</p>
<p>You cannot win an argument with someone that isn&rsquo;t interested in sitting down to discuss the problems at issue at all.  Man up Texans, Napolitano has proven beyond any and all reasonable doubt that she is _not_ coming because she _does not care_.</p>

		<p>The only thing that will stop this flow is the US military. Remove them from Germany, S. Korea, the Middle East and put them on the border with Mexico.  Have ICE go through the barriors in LA, Phoenix, Houston, etc. and find as many illegal Mexicans as possible.  Force the illegals to build the border fence and repatriate them.  After the fence is built, hire citizen patriots to man the guard towers with shoot-to-kill orders if illegals cross into American soil.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>

		<p>This, like the British girls being groomed for sex by &#8220;Asians&#8221;, is nothing new.  Heck, this isn&rsquo;t even the first time a county sheriff has called out politicians to come down.  This isn&rsquo;t even the first one to do it in Texas, for that matter.  </p>
<p>Nothing will be done unless the people stand up to the govt.  And that will not be done until it affects a large amount of people.  Do you think people in Vermont or Michigan are worried about this?  Do you think they even heard of this unless they visit this site?  No.</p>
<p>This will continue to be an issue until people take up arms and defend the borders themselves, have an &#8220;uprising&#8221;  in D.C. like so many protests (but much bigger), or this happens to the daughter or son of a major politician.</p>
<p>Until this type of stuff is on peoples&rsquo; doorsteps it is out of sight, out of mind; this is especially true with politicians in their glass bubbles behind the gates with guard towers.</p>

		<p>It would be great fun to file a writ of mandamus (in this case, I think only the Supreme Ct would be a potential venue) in order to force the President (the executive) to enforce the law.  Clearly, policy is to restrict enforcement of immigration laws.  That could change, and it is situations such as described by the Sheriff that could make the case.</p>

		<p>If the US can keep soldiers stationed in 130+ countries around the world, certainly it should be able to station the military along the Mexican border. All of the body scanners, biometric passports, and other security measures that are needed in order to board a flight are pointless when immigrants from many countries around the world travel to and fro over the Mexican border with ease.</p>

		<p>Put a 5-mile no-go zone buffering area on each side of the border. Have napalm loaded planes patrolling 27/7. Unload on anything that moves in either direction. Have border patrol stationed every few hundred yards on our side of the no-go zone for the whole length of the border, with orders to shoot to kill anything that got through the air surveillance. And finally build a 16 foot high metal fence down the middle of the damn river and wire about 1,000,000 volts of electricity through it.*Okay, sarcasm off now, but really, we have to get tough on this problem. <br>
Just telling  them &#8220;no-no&#8221; isn&rsquo;t going to stop them from strolling back and forth across our borders.  THEY HAVE TO BE STOPPED BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE.</p>

		<p>Of course the border is open - it&rsquo;s by design. Politically, both parties think they need to be soft on illegal immigration so they can get Hispanic votes. </p>

		<p>If we are more intelligent (on average) than blacks and hispanics, why are we letting them take our country away from us? For any injustice against minorities, real or perceived, they unite, protest, threaten, and/or riot. They almost always get their way, and their numbers are still less than ours. We can&rsquo;t we do the same? We are supposedly more intelligent than they are. What is the problem?</p>

		<p>If the DHS can lock down the airports and the TSA spend inordinate amounts of time harassing law abiding travelers at screening points, then why can&rsquo;t these worthies be sent on down to the US-Mexican border to provide security against illegal aliens? But it&rsquo;s the same old story of anarcho-tyranny: the government puts the boot in against the citizenry while ignoring mass criminal activities by aliens.</p>

		<p>Our government will do nothing.  Just today the court knocked down the Arizona immigration law.  The Justice department won, the State of Arizona lost.  The supreme court has 3 women, a couple of so called conservative men whose only interest is anti abortion and anti gay.  The rest are liberal anti White men.</p>
<p>So the Justice department and the illegals will win. The Arizona immigration law will be struck down again by the supreme court.  The ACLU/SPLC crew will continue suing householders who resist the take over of their land by illegals.</p>

<p>Next move in the Arizona illegal immigration law fight: An immediate Supreme Court petition?<br>
 Comments (12) (20)(31)April 11, 2011 |  4:48 pm </p>
<p><br>
Arizona&rsquo;s Gov. Jan Brewer and Attorney General Tom Horne expressed disappointment late Monday in a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that continued an injunction against four key elements of their state&rsquo;s controversial illegal immigration law, S.B. 1070.</p>
<p>In a joint statement the officials said they were considering their legal options and expressed strong criticism of the Ninth Circuit&rsquo;s decision giving special weight to the opposition of other governments such as Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I note,&#8221; said Horne, &#8220;that the 9th Circuit relied heavily on the opposition of foreign governments in upholding the injunction on two of the four elements. As the dissent by Judge Carlos T. Bea eloquently stated, foreign governments should not be given a &lsquo;heckler&rsquo;s veto&rsquo; to establish preemption by the federal government over the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brewer, who signed the measure nearly a year ago, called that aspect &#8220;outrageous, adding:&hellip;.</p>
<p>&hellip;.&#8221;Today&rsquo;s decision is internationalism run amok that ranks right up there with the U.S. State Department&rsquo;s decision to refer S.B. 1070 to the United Nations Human Rights Council.&#8221; <br>
The overwhelming passage by Arizona&rsquo;s legislature, which it tied to inadequate Mexican border security by federal authorities, has prompted more than two dozen other states to consider similar legislation which, among other things, requires local police to check the immigration status of those encountered in investigations and traffic stops.</p>
<p>Brewer and others blamed years of poor federal border security for local crime and increased drug violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For decades,&#8221; Brewer said today, &#8220;the federal government has neglected its constitutional duty to American citizens by failing to secure the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;States like Arizona have borne the brunt of that failure. We see the impacts in our border areas, where Arizona ranchers live day and night with human-traffickers crossing their lands. We see it in our neighborhoods and communities, where drop houses and drug-runners have become a staple of the evening news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Added Brewer: &ldquo;I remain steadfast in my belief that Arizona and other states have a sovereign right and obligation to protect their citizens and enforce immigration law in accordance with federal statute. Monday&rsquo;s decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold Judge Bolton&rsquo;s suspension of key provisions of SB 1070 does harm to the safety and well-being of Arizonans who suffer the negative effects of illegal immigration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting that the Ninth Circuit is the nation&rsquo;s most frequently overturned appeals court, Brewer said she and Horne will consult with the legislature&rsquo;s attorneys to decide on the next move, which could involve an immediate petititon to the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the injunction.</p>

		<p>At this point I only care if the victims are European American.  I don&rsquo;t think of Mexican, etc. Americans as my compatriots.  It sounds hateful, but I don&rsquo;t care anymore.  I went with a sick friend to a local ER yesterday.  A REAL emergency, unlike two hispanic guys who had stomach aches.  It was disgusting.  Less than five white Americans.  Everyone else, and the place was packed with beds being rolled out into the middle of the floor because no more curtained off areas were left.  I doubt many had private insurance.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they all had medicaid.    </p>

		<p>Our government won&rsquo;t protect us because we are white and our assailants are red-brown. I&rsquo;m glad I have a shotgun and a pistol. We are facing reconquista. I guarantee the federali would protect their side of the border a lot better than our government protect our side of the border. How about we all become legal mexican citizens?</p>
