					<p>Niamh Walsh, Daily Mail (London), March 21, 2011</p>					
					
									
                
                	
	                	<p>Stunning Miss Ireland Emma Waldron told yesterday in a forthright interview how she will never let &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; racists affect her love for Nigerian boyfriend Manners Oshafi.</p>
<p>Emma, 21, has been the victim of a vicious internet campaign because of her relationship with a black man and was forced to report an online poster targeting her with hateful and abusive racist comments.</p>
<p>She recently found herself at the centre of a row after one person branded her &#8216;disgusting&rsquo; for dating a black man.</p>
<p>And the stunning brunette told the Irish Mail on Sunday in an exclusive interview how one person went so far as to set up an account to target the couple.</p>
<p>&#8216;One Twitter account was set up specifically to send me hateful comments.</p>
<p>&#8216;But I blocked them and reported them so I don&rsquo;t get the messages any more,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>The couple-who have been dating for nearly a year-have even earned their own Brangelina-like portmanteau.</p>
<p>Friends have dubbed them &#8216;Memmers&rsquo;, a combination of Emma and Manners.</p>
<p>And such is the strength of their relationship that Emma and Manners have vowed not to allow themselves to be victimised.</p>
<p>&#8216;We are a very strong couple and we don&rsquo;t really care what people think.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have not been affected at all by the remarks on Twitter as it just stems from people&rsquo;s ignorance,&rsquo; said Manners.</p>
<p>Emma, who came fourth in the Miss World competition before Christmas, said that while she has encountered racism while out with Manners, 23, she refuses to let it get to her.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have experienced negative comments on nights out and on social networking sites but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>&#8216;I will never let someone&rsquo;s ignorance affect my love for Manners. He is the most amazing person I have ever met.</p>
<p>&#8216;What colour my skin is doesn&rsquo;t matter to him and what colour his skin is doesn&rsquo;t matter to me.</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Couple.jpg" src="/news/2011/04/01/Couple.jpg" width="468" height="431" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The happy couple.</strong></div>
<p>&#8216;What matters in friendship and love is the heart and soul of the person you are in a relationship with and his heart is so big and I&rsquo;m lucky to be in it,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Kildare beauty said while everyone is entitled to their opinion, she feels that now that Ireland is a multi-cultural society, people should be educated.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think that Ireland is so rich in many cultures and often times preconceived notions influence how people treat others who are of different colour, creed or sexuality.</p>
<p>&#8216;We need to help break down the barriers that sometimes build up in our homes, schools and society. The way to do this is by educating people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emma said that her parents&rsquo; openness and acceptance has had huge impact on her and her choices.</p>
<p>&#8216;My grandmother is Swedish and my dad is part-Italian, so as a family we have always been open,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;They love Manners and his family love me. There really is no issue of colour at all. He&rsquo;s just my boyfriend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Manners moved to Ireland eight years ago with his parents and four siblings. The family first settled in Athlone.</p>
<p>In a reflection of the changing nature of modern Ireland, he revealed that he was the first black boy in his school.</p>
<p>&#8216;It was strange coming to Ireland, cold,&rsquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8216;But Ireland is a great country. Myself and my brother were the first black kids in the school in Athlone so we were seen as being different but good different.</p>
<p>&#8216;We made good friends and were never bullied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Manners has just completed a master&rsquo;s degree in telecommunications engineering at Dublin City University.</p>
<p>Now Emma&rsquo;s boyfriend is helping her develop her website as she has her sights set on a career in television.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am going back to St Pat&rsquo;s [St Patrick's College] this year as I want to qualify as a teacher but I would also like to do some TV work,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>The statuesque beauty is currently working with the makers of [reality TV show] Fade Street on an online fashion programme.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have been doing an online fashion magazine show called Stylemania and it&rsquo;s going really well. I would love to do some TV work and this is giving me great experience. It&rsquo;s going really well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emma, who carries out voluntary work with St Vincent de Paul, said that she feels compelled to speak out against bullies and racists.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am very lucky in that I have a platform and I can use that. Yes, I have been the target of a bully but I am strong and have dealt with it.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s International Day Against Racism tomorrow and I think we all have a role to play to promote equality and raise awareness.</p>
<p>&#8216;I can draw from my experiences and even if I help one person to overcome bullying, well, then that&rsquo;s something,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Emma, who is first violin with the Hibernian Symphony Orchestra, said that people need to be educated on race and different cultures.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think it would be very naive of me to say that there is no racism in Ireland. Unfortunately there is.</p>
<p>&#8216;If you socialise with people from different races and cultures you are less likely to show hatred towards them. But it still exists. I think people should make an effort to know people different from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good-looking couple have just bought a Labrador called Herbie and say that while they are very happy together they have no plans to set up home just yet.</p>
<p>&#8216;Emma is terrific,&rsquo; said Manners. &#8216;We are different in some ways but in other ways we are like soul mates.</p>
<p>&#8216;We think the same way and sometimes will finish each other&rsquo;s sentences. But Emma is going back to college so we have no plans to move in just yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The computer whizz also revealed that he has no problems with Emma&rsquo;s work as a model.</p>
<p>&#8216;Why would I? She always looks great in pictures. She is gorgeous. I&rsquo;m a lucky man,&rsquo; he laughed.</p>
