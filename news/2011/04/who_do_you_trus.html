Study Reveals Our Unconscious Mind Can Have Racist Tendencies &hellip; No Matter How Liberal We Are on Surface</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), April 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you were shown a picture of a black person and a white person and asked &#8216;who do you trust more,&rsquo; your actual answer may be very different from the one in your unconscious mind, a study has revealed.</p>
<p>Researchers found that deciding who we trust  &mdash;  especially with our money  &mdash;  may be influenced more by subconscious racial biases that many of us would be horrified to admit.</p>
<p>&#8216;We strive as a culture to not let race bias be a significant factor in the way we choose to do things and on an individual level, we all assume that our beliefs reflect our actions, but we have to be aware of the fact that this won&rsquo;t always be the case,&rsquo;  Elizabeth Phelps, a psychologist at New York University and co-author of the study, told ABC News.</p>
<p>Researchers measured implied and expressed racial bias among 50 racially diverse participants using an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and questionnaires.</p>
<p>They then asked participants to rate the &#8216;trustworthiness&rsquo; of nearly 300 faces of people from many races (although the scores for blacks and whites were used in the analysis).</p>
<p>Participants then played a trust-based economic reward game. </p>
<p>Overall, if they showed an unconscious bias toward white people, they were more likely to say they trust whites more when asked  &mdash;  and more likely to risk more money.</p>
<p>The same bias showed up in the minority of participants that showed a bias towards black people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Despite study after study showing that implicit bias exists, it&rsquo;s still something that a lot of people don&rsquo;t internalise within their own lives and behaviour,&rsquo; Leslie Hausmann, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, told ABC.</p>
<p>&#8216;There&rsquo;s a reluctance to admit that in our day-to-day lives, we have this and it matters,&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>Although researchers said the study was not &#8216;overwhelming evidence for racism&rsquo; when they measured this kind of subconscious prejudice in doctors treating minorities, the doctors were shocked to discover their unconscious bias affected what medications they prescribed to different races. </p>
<p>&#8216;Humans have always struggled with this: am I leading my daily life in such a way that my behaviour lines up with the values I have?&rsquo; said Mahzarin Banaji, a co-author and psychologist at Harvard University  </p>
<p>&#8216;Acknowledging this bias is part of bringing our behaviour in line with intentions.&rsquo;</p>

		<p> They must have had some really slow days recently at three major universities, to be wasting time, money and effort on twaddle like this.</p>
<p> There are no lengths to which liberals will not go not only to prove the existence of &#8220;racism&#8221; (and they always mean &#8220;White racism,&#8221; no matter how they try to generalize about it), but to find ways we can &#8220;overcome&#8221; it. Why, of course! All we have to do is change human nature!</p>
<p> Notice how the writer says near the end of the piece that doctors treating minorities were &#8220;shocked&#8221; at how their &#8220;unconscious biases&#8221; affected the way they prescribed for patients of different races. Are we supposed to assume he&rsquo;s talking about only &#8220;White doctors&#8221;? He cleverly tap-dances around that. Don&rsquo;t forget that in both Britain and the U.S. nowadays, there are many, many doctors who would not qualify as &#8220;White&#8221;. Are they biased against their fellow non-Whites?</p>

		<p>Of course we do, its survival.<br>
If I have to choose between walking past a group of black youth or white youth, I&rsquo;m going to choose the latter. Why? Because the chances of me being assaulted, robbed, etc are incredibly lower!<br>
This study also points out that it isn&rsquo;t just whites that feel this way, anyone with a working mind can tell the danger that large groups of blacks pose.<br>

		<p>I would call it INSTINCTIVE tendencies, not &#8220;racist&#8221; ones. I would also say these INSTINTCS are borne out by real life experience. Say your car breaks down in the countryside. In different directions, each ten miles apart are two towns of 5,000 people. One is 99% black and one is 99% white. Which town would you go to? Both my instinctual and real life views would compel me to the white town.</p>

		<p> Over the years, I&rsquo;ve found it darkly humorous when I read the prognostications of the upper-middle-class welfare cohort- tenured members of the &#8220;Academy&#8221;. They remind me of the monks during the Middle Ages who traveled from town to town engaged in self-flagellation to counter &#8220;sins&#8221;. For these &#8220;intellectuals&#8221;, the absence of evidence is evidence that the sin exists. This type of behavior is simply a backdoor way of attempting to validate the existence of White Priviledge.<br>
 Heaven forbid anyone points out that forced Diversity breeds distrust even within members of the same group.</p>

		<p>So there is a big disconnect between the way we really feel, and what we profess.</p>
<p>This is an unhealthy situation. An organism must be whole to really experience life to the full. And it is the &#8220;feelings&#8221; which override the &#8220;rational.&#8221; So this indicates that people are being cowed to believe something which their hearts tell them is not true.</p>
<p>How did this situation come about?</p>
<p>I would suggest Christianity and its bastard stepchild, Liberalism.</p>
<p>After all, it is these ideologies which threaten us, either with eternal flames one the one hand, or financial ruin on the other hand, if we do not toe the line. </p>
<p>Pah! I will be a man!</p>

		<p>What a muddled mess!  The article appears to conclude that test-takers have subconscious racism but cover it up with non-racist sounding responses.  If so, how would one know that any of them DID have racist thoughts?  And docs prescribing different meds for different races?  Half the time the liberals are complaining that medical people pay no attention to crucial racial differences, and half the time they call such attention racist!</p>

		<p>Of course they never adjust for present behavior or past experience with said race either&hellip;</p>
<p>Nor do they include the other ethnic groups because then the bias against blacks would be &#8216;overwhelmingly racist&rsquo; rather than only-white bigoted.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be fair and honest and &#8216;scientific&rsquo; here:  Part of the visual psychology which helped whites hold social cohesion over long periods of isolation at great distances from each other was a small mutation that caused oxytocin release (a brain calming endorphin) so that &#8216;being around whites&rsquo; naturally led to feelings of well being and safety.</p>
<p>We are truly members of an extended family, a Kindred if you will.</p>
<p>The same psychology is NOT active in all races who know, instinctively, not to trust each other without condition.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with this.  Because whites have used this social altruism to build trust amongst each other and allow for individuals not of the family or tribal endogroup to achieve recognition through achievement.</p>
<p>We call this &#8216;individuality&rsquo; and it is what allows us to cheer any great in any sport, even if he/she are not &#8216;on our team&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But the other races have stuck to a duller, lower, standard of tribalism which isolates them within their own me-my brother-my cousin- my village- my tribe allegiances, very much fixated on achieving group dominance, whether right or wrong.</p>
<p>Allowing such exploitative, opportunistic, non-balanced thinkers into our population is inviting extinction.</p>
<p>Prejudice is good.  It has valid biological conservatism and resulting species preserving reasons.  That&rsquo;s right, I said _species_.  Because a race is nothing more or less than an example of human speciation in terrain isolates.  No different from birds in the Gallapagos.</p>
<p>The blacks and hispanics are examples of peoples caught out of time who never made the L1/L2-&gt;L3 (M and N) jump to advanced, adaptive, thought.  Hispanics in particular also serve as an example of what happens when you get a comingling of genelines in that you have a half and half averaging of intelligence but no release of the tribalist identities that always puts &#8216;Mestizo before American&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We are NOT coincident people.  Our evolutionary arcs are peaked differently and it may well be that the unfortunates stuck with as much as in their genetic inheritance backwaters are not ever going to catch up.</p>
<p>Lessening ourselves to make them feel better is not the solution.</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;subconscious racial biases that many of us would be horrified to admit.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Horrified to admit? Is that how I&rsquo;m supposed to react to my instincts and gut feelings? Horrified?</p>

<p>Do we strive not to let race bias be a factor or, again, is this how I&rsquo;m supposed to react?</p>

<p>Good heavens! An admission of facts. Minorities have biases to their own people as well!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t deny my biases and I have no intention of altering them for anyone or any reason.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;Acknowledging this bias is part of bringing our behavior in line with intentions.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now required to admit my biases and &#8216;bring my behavior in line with intentions&rsquo;. Whose intentions?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before on Amren, but I know a number of liberals.  And they are quite fond of using the N-word behind closed doors.</p>
<p>This is something the average normal, racially conscious person does not truly understand.  Liberalism is a disease.  Literally.  Yes, people like to make jokes about politically divisive opponents being crazy and its been a big technique used as oppression in places like the Soviet Union (treat political dissidents as mental patients, &#8220;hospitalize&#8221; them, &#8220;medicate&#8221; them, lobotomize them).  But in the case of liberalism, it really IS a mental disease.  Closely related to Borderline Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>They have primitive (the psychological term &#8220;primitive&#8221; meaning surface level, incomplete, caricaturized) ways of seeing others, ESPECIALLY blacks.  One second they are worshipping them (and make no mistake, the worship is pretty close to being literal).  The next, they hate them.  A woman might defile herself with a black man, and have black children, then beat them.  A friend of mine once told about the horrible abuse she endured as a child.  Her father was jewish and married a black woman.  And spent most of her childhood beating both of them and calling her a n**gger every day.</p>
<p>Which is why liberals have to be watched very closely.  Classic example is the antifa.  These people are basically nazis who feel perfectly justified in murdering people just because they might hold &#8220;racist&#8221;, usually anti-immigrant beliefs.  Some even go around shaving their heads and wearing jack boots.  The so called Sharps.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the behavior and sickness that these people love.  They would be just as happy to shave 88 into their scalp and be the real thing.</p>
<p>Just one of the many reasons that radical separation is the only real answer to the race issue. </p>

		<p>The unconscious mind is one of the most powerful parts to our being. So it comes to no surprise that the article states that everyone, even those who proclaim themselves to be liberal, has a preference for their own kind. It&rsquo;s all part of nature, and try as the &#8220;progressives&#8221; might, they will never be able to change the laws of nature.</p>

@ Anon 10</p>
<p>That was the smartest post I&rsquo;ve seen yet. I wrote something similar a while back. Great job! As you said whites use their social altruism to rise above and give us the western world we see today. </p>
<p>Individuality does give rise to higher intelligence but can also sow destruction due to a lack of perceptiveness that not everyone is like you. Collectivism can stifle learning, but it can also make a stronger bond within a community. Nothing is black and white (no pun intended). Understanding concepts, their strengths and weaknesses, can yield evolution.</p>
<p>Prejudices are mechanisms to ensure survival. Sure, it could be argued that it may not allow others (or themselves) to reach the highest potential possible; but without it, the human species would be dead a long time ago.</p>
<p>The problem with most white Liberal thinkers (or Individualist of this type) is that they make the assumption that everyone is as altruist as them or that everyone can think outside of their group. Another one is the idea that man is innately good or can change for the better. While it is true that being able to project desired outcomes is helpful and necessary, when the same trends continue to reoccur, it becomes ultimately folly.</p>
<p>The reality can be quite different. When we attempt to (out of some false sense of morality) change groups of people in the belief that they can be like us, it only leads to failure, hate, and &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; wrought upon the &#8220;oppressed.&#8221; Whites will take upon themselves to help others at the expense of blaming and hurting themselves.</p>
<p>Many other groups are more likely to do the opposite. </p>
<p>Blame.</p>
<p>While blame may have some merit, if left unchecked becomes destructive and makes everyone miserable. Proclaiming that &ldquo;the white man did it,&rdquo; brushes away self-responsibility that may help them in the long run.  </p>
<p>And yet again, whites will openly take these accusations because whites are the reason why others are not succeeding in life. It is not our job to help everyone around the world. Others must do that for themselves. More intelligent people will often look for solutions to their own problems. Whites are more likely to fix any problem that may arise even if it is not ours. It is a like a bad relationship where one person continuously does things for the other yet the other finds fault with everything that person does. The best way to leave such a relationship is to recognize that you did everything you could, and there is nothing more you can do. Each person or group needs to find it within themselves for answers.</p>
<p>It is ironic. The best way to help minorities is to make them account for their own actions. Living in the past yields no positive results. Yet those who insist, out of past injustices, do so truly out of guilt and lack of self worth. Self esteem is highly correlated to one&rsquo;s own ability to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Again, it is not our job to bring about change to the rest of the world. It is honorable that many white liberals will sacrifice their time to help those less fortunate in the world, adopt babies from other racial groups and cultures, etc, but in the end it doesn&rsquo;t help anyone. It can even dissolve a society from within. It can cause harm to those in the working in 3rd world countries and hatred of foreign interference. Yet we continue to give aid, like a parent appeasing a spoiled child. And in the end no matter how much whites try, other group will continue to blame and account no responsibility. It is up to them to rise above their own problems. If those who call themselves &ldquo;altruist&rdquo; truly care, there is a saying, &#8220;Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man how to fish, you feed him for a life time.&#8221; Whites have given, above and beyond, the tools needed to fish. It is now time for others to fish for themselves. </p>
<p>I do believe it is because of our open mindedness, our ability to transcend reality out of the belief that many will change even in spite of reality, our desire to take full responsibility without balanced perspective, will lead us to destruction.</p>

That wild animals and domesticated  animals and rural folks prefer &#8220;their own kind&#8221; in natural conditions of space, feeding resources, etc., is justly assumed to be part of nature.        </p>

		<p>Subconscious race bias just means that you have honed your instincts and that you have learned who what when and where to discriminate. One can subconsciously know that they&rsquo;d be better off breaking down on one side of the tracks than the other. It isn&rsquo;t racism to not want to be a victim. It&rsquo;s just discrimination plain and simple, and discrimination is not racism.</p>

		<p>They speak of trusting people with your money.</p>
<p>Well, I have learned, from long experience working with many blacks, not to trust blacks  with my money. I no longer lend.  They have a very different idea about money than we do.  When they say, &#8220;Can you lend me some money?&#8221;, they really mean will you GIVE them some money. To them, a loan is a gift, rarely paid back. If you ask for it or remind them of it,  they can get VERY indignant and abusive.  They are very casual in all respects about money, as reflected in why they never have any and why they&rsquo;re always in debt.</p>
<p>Sorry, this isn&rsquo;t PRE-judice,  it comes from hard experience.</p>

		<p>If you have ever lived in an area where a large number of the residents were blacks, you would know it is NOT your subconscious mind telling you not to trust them and to avoid them.<br>
Nope it&rsquo;s NOT your subconscious mind at all..</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t really care if my &#8220;subconscious&#8221; may be racially biased. I do know my conscious thought is! It is called racial survival. It is called a God given instinct from day one. It is called learning from history, it is called experience. It is called believing what you see with your own eyes.</p>

		<p>I wrote this summary of my feelings on race and diversity etc, which may or may not be of interest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sampled both white Christian homogeneous societies and mixed.<br>
I have to say I prefer the white homogeneous one, simply because I feel more relaxed.<br>
Now, the mixed societies are interesting and stimulating, however I find I always experience a degree of alarm-reaction( it shouldn&rsquo;t be there but it is) which I have to suppress. This is wearing. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice it so much when young, but now when older, I positively look forward to returning to what are still white homogeneous communities. It&rsquo;s like a weight coming off your shoulders.<br>
The relationships are deeper, there&rsquo;s less need to be &#8220;politically correct&#8221; but above all the vastly increased opportunities for shared humour is the most noticeable benefit.<br>
For that reason I don&rsquo;t think the concept of nationality is going to die out.</p>
<p>It may be in fact, that as we experience ever more diversity, that most will seek an anchor in tradition and family and regional if not national loyalty, and come to value such attachments, where they are at present largely taken for granted.<br>
Certainly as a result of being exposed to diversity, I&rsquo;ve taken a greater interest in my own white racial identity and culture having been forced to learn about and respect the racial identity and cultures of others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the paradox. Where before I thought little about my race or religion, now I study both and cling to them like a limpet to a rock in stormy seas.</p>

		<p>@15 Ben,</p>
<p>I think that the moment when we could &#8216;solve the problem&rsquo; by forced withdrawal from all points of social contention are gone.</p>
<p>There are things you cannot do if you want to sustain global resource access in a country that has a debt load as monumental as ours.</p>
<p>What put us there is &#8216;subconscious psychology&rsquo; of politicians.</p>
<p>Politicians as power brokers are &#8216;accommodators&rsquo; that use fulfilling other&rsquo;s needs as a means to elevate their own social worth and in so doing, attach their pre-eminence to the values of those whom they are helping.  This &#8216;not what but who you know&rsquo; approach to living is what keeps us mired in an age of un-reason and limited scientific solutions to highly technical problems.  Because band aiding problems keeps people dependently interlinked.</p>
<p>We can help blacks live in a society that reflects ours by two means:</p>
<p>1.  Automation to do the tasks they will not and we care not to associate with them in doing.  You cannot make a New York or Dallas in Africa with a 67-70 IQ average intelligence.  But you can create a basic infrastructure which, with high protein diets and good water and access to mind-growing &#8216;edutainment&rsquo;, can give them the IQ to -someday- do so, themselves.</p>
<p>2.  Genomic therapy to apply as retrovirals and hormonal treatments in altering the black genetic bias towards lower social cohesion through absent IQ.  Smart people know not to mess up what they depend upon.  Blacks and frankly most other ethnies are a step away from survival mode behaviors that put no emphasis on the group (one of the ironies of &#8216;tribalist&rsquo; behaviors is that they are first and foremost exploitative for the individual).</p>
<p>We cannot achieve these technical means whilst living in a community whose leaders benefit from exploiting everyone they shake hands with.  We have to be able to separate so that:</p>
<p>A.  Our ability to engineer beyond the Ludditism of &#8216;better toys not better people&rsquo; can be assured, for ourselves.</p>
<p>B.  Our -example- to others proves the point that we were correct.  Right enough to be left alone.  Right enough to be able to _trade for_ what he have developed for ourselves to others who are even more desperately in need.  Resources for Automation.</p>
<p>I have no problem &#8216;loan gifting&rsquo; someone a means to improve themselves.  I simply look at most of Africa and Central/South Asia as places were 70-80 IQs can never achieve what we have and yet (since television) want it anyway.  Having infected them with the want of our standard of living, it is unwise to draw the candy away from the baby.</p>
<p>Yet we must still look to ourselves first.  In 1950, we were roughly 28% of the global population.  Today, we are approximately 16% of that total.  In 2060, we will be at 9.76%, assuming there is no massive kill off or disenfranchisement of whites thanks to immigration:</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/y1cSQ</p>
<p>We will lack the numbers or the raw materials access to enforce our will, if we do not stop them from procreating rapidly.  For both our goods.</p>
<p>One way to ensure we remain who we are is to buy off those hi-gain populations (black, sub saharan, Africans 133% gain to 2.7 billion or 25% of planetary population) _on the condition_ that they accept birth control to live in centralized village-states, _now_.</p>
<p>If not, the very thing you see happening in Italy, England and France will occur in America as huge population overburdens from countries like India (29% of world population, nearly 3 billion, by 2060) are &#8216;shuffled&rsquo; into open lands like ours, in trade for industrial output or other commerce financing.  Courtesy of our &#8216;Awwwwh the poor refugees must have a home, pay up!&rsquo; politicians.</p>
<p>In the process, making all of America look like a Mumbai or Kibera slum (750,000 people per square mile).  Just like the rest of the third world.</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/6rdN8</p>
<p>Once we stop making excuses for why race is NOT &#8216;just skin deep&rsquo; we can make real developments that we CAN &#8216;give away&rsquo; to offer real hope of improvement to their problems without making them our own.  But there is no evolutionary or biblical &#8216;positive outcome&rsquo; from a merging of the races as cultures.  There is only a Malthusian one which, like as not, will result in a total die off of the planet&rsquo;s top species.</p>
<p>Just listen to the music that goes with the first LINK&rsquo;d video.  No jungle drums, no vile, misogynistic, rap rhymes.  Only the elegance of a culture so old we dare not lose it.</p>
<p>And we will, without a homeland as a genetic and folkway repository of our own.  It is not our fault that we have the best.  We do NOT have to share what is ours.  Not when we can -give- something much more valuable.  A chance to leave a failed genetic legacy behind.</p>

<p>Great Post.</p>
<p>Yes I know EXACTLY where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>As I stated before (read above)&hellip;nothing is black and white. <br>
&#8220;Diversity&#8221; yields many things. </p>
<p>Lets change that. </p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; is a such a vague term that just gets thrown around here a lot and is always bad. It can mean many different things in different context.</p>
<p>So lets talk about different racial and cultural groups living together and what arises from it. You do learn a lot about different cultures. There can be stimulation. It does get old and there is always dangers that are along with it. As you said, only in living with other groups can one draw experiences and conclusions that it may not be all what it is cracked up to be.</p>
<p>I would add when you lived in a diverse place for long, you don&rsquo;t know any other alternate reality. Meaning before I came to a near dominant white neighborhood I had nothing to compare it to where I was living during the time. Those who fight for the status quo, while living in diverse areas, really don&rsquo;t know nice things really can be (hence those who advocate one ideal but live in another).</p>
<p>Something isn&rsquo;t dear to you until you start to lose it. </p>
<p>No one thinks about eyesight until one&rsquo;s eyes start failing them. </p>
<p>No one thinks about value of money until they start to lose it.</p>
<p>No one values skin color until we all start becoming the same.</p>
<p>No one values youth until age starts to catch up to them.</p>
<p>No one values being loved from another until people stop caring for them.</p>
<p>No one values life until death nearly takes them.</p>
<p>No one values culture until it starts disappearing.</p>
<p>Everything runs together and has interesting ways of pulling us in directions we don&rsquo;t foresee. In that way many things depend upon context rather than strict ideals.</p>
<p>Fear not. The saying goes it is &#8220;darkest before dawn.&#8221; Everything is tied together; and like a pendulum swing, it will swing back.</p>
<p>I felt that &#8220;pull&#8221; too, friend.</p>

		<p>I like sharks. I like swimming near them. But I wouldn&rsquo;t get too near one that gave me signs of being agitated by my presence. Nor do I universally view sharks as benign. I would NOT, for instance, swim near a great white, because if it got aggressive, then I&rsquo;d be a two bite meal. Just not worth it, despite their beauty.<br>
I love Tiger sharks, but they are downright aggressive to humans. Ditto Bull Sharks.</p>
<p>I try to keep a very keen sense of their behavior, my distance, and if they feel their space is being invaded. Some are plain docile. Some are indifferent. Some let you know they don&rsquo;t want your company.  Some let you know they might want a taste of you. You pay attention to all that.  You can&rsquo;t blame a shark for being a shark.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just common sense.</p>
<p>I have never&hellip;ever been accosted by/shot at/threatened by a white man as an adult (boys will be boys, and I certainly had to defend myself sometimes as a boy).<br>
But I have been menaced by black men. Were I not assertive enough to make them reconsider and back down, I would have been beaten, or worse. </p>
<p>I have simply never experienced that sort of danger form whites (I know bouncers will tell a different story, but drunken idiot losers don&rsquo;t count).</p>
<p>Point is, I KNOW in my bones- as I did as a kid- that many, many blacks- in fact the vast majority of blacks from all- black areas- are dangerous in one way or another. Either they are predators, or they are friends of predators, or they would do nothing to stop predation. That&rsquo;s the kind of stuff your mom told you to avoid&hellip;so you&rsquo;d survive. Because she loved you. It&rsquo;s INSTINCT.</p>
<p>People who lack that instinct, or whom shun it, are the sort who try to hand feed great whites and lose a head and a torso, or who try to pet tigers, and lose same, or date blacks, and lose in a far worse way, getting defiled, raped, and scarred for life.</p>

		<p>Oh dear! Another attempt to label &#8220;racism&#8221; as a mental problem and force us all to take happy pills, isn&rsquo;t it? <br>
It sounds like multicult dogma, it&rsquo;s a religion that goes against human nature. <br>
These biases are good, natural emotions; like happiness, sadness, anger, love, hate, joy, grief, etc.<br>
