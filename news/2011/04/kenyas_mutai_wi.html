			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, April 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Kenya&rsquo;s Geoffrey Mutai ran the fastest 26.2 miles in history to win the Boston Marathon on Monday. Then his claim to a world record was swallowed up by the hills.</p>
<p>Not the inclines of Heartbreak Hill that have doomed so many runners before him.</p>
<p>It was the downhill part of the race that makes his time of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 2 seconds ineligible for an official world record. In short: IAAF rules have deemed the oldest and most prestigious marathon in the world  &mdash;  long considered the one of the most difficult, too  &mdash;  to be too easy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mutai outsprinted Moses Mosop down Boylston Street to win by four seconds as the two Kenyans both beat Haile Gebrselassie&rsquo;s sanctioned world record of 2:03:59. Four men, including third-place finisher Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia and American Ryan Hall, broke the course record of 2:05:52 set just last year by Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a stunning performance and an immensely fast time here today,&#8221; said Tom Grilk, the head of the Boston Athletic Association, after Mutai ran almost a full minute faster than the sanctioned world record. &#8220;We in Boston are well-pleased with what has happened, and that&rsquo;s good unto itself. The definitions of others, I will leave to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kilel won the women&rsquo;s race to complete the Kenyan sweep, outsprinting American Desiree Davila to win by two seconds in 2:22:36. Davila led as late as the final stretch on Boylston Street and ran the fastest time ever for a U.S. woman, five seconds faster than Benoit, who is now known as Joan Samuelson.</p>
<p>Kara Goucher ran a personal best 2:24:52 to add a fifth-place finish to her third in 2009. No American  &mdash;  man or woman  &mdash;  has won Boston since Lisa Larsen-Weidenbach in 1985.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mutai and Mosop ran side-by-side for the final miles before Mutai pulled ahead for good on Boylston Street. The 19th Kenyan winner in the past 21 years, Mutai raised his arms in the air and grinned.</p>

		<p>As a former runner, this transformation of Track &amp; Field and road racing was beginning way back in the 1960&rsquo;s with a re-vamping of sports and a surge in all of the major sports, by Black athletes.  It started slowly and almost imperceptibly and by the 1980&rsquo;s usually all the sprint finals in all the Olympics were dominated by Black runners.  They became all-Black.  Then the distance events were next.  They started to become dominated by Black athletes as well, especially Black athletes from Africa.  Many people - especially liberals and Blacks themselves would like to attribute this to Black athletic superiority.  One must understand that when we talk about Black superiority, it is not racism.  It is only racism if we were discussing Whites and claiming that Whites were superior in some way to other races.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that White kids today are well-indoctrinated almost with an intrinsic belief now that Blacks are superior to them in athletics.  As we go further and further ahead in time, members of our race, sink further and further into the abyss of this destructive belief system, perpetrated on us by the media and their constant positive depictions of Blacks and negative depictions of Whites.  Since we&rsquo;ve begun to believe that we can&rsquo;t compete with Blacks on the athletic field, there have been correspondingly less and less Whites in major sports.  It is a virtual vicious circle.  As more and more Blacks compete, it is like a neighborhood that becomes Black; once it&rsquo;s all-Black, it&rsquo;s all Black, Whites will no longer entertain thoughts of living there.  We see this now in European athletics too.  Decades ago Europeans and Whites dominated Track &amp; Field and also the distance events and the marathon.  There were so many.  People like Lasse Viren, Ron Clarke, Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett, Rod Dixon, Jim Ryun, Ian Stewart, Frank Shorter, Bill Rodgers et, al.  Now you&rsquo;ll see nary a White athlete who can even come close to competing at the distance events at a world-class level.  The truth is many Whites have lost the desire to compete because of this media brainwashing of Whites.  As we proceed further and further into the future it gets worse and worse.  And once Blacks dominate a sport, they see to it that the few Whites who compete have a difficult time; in other words, they discriminate against them. Of course that&rsquo;s okay.  Discrimination against Whites is perfectly acceptable.  This lack of Whites in sports is also reflected among everything else in Western and European society.  Our birth rate is barely at the replacement level, and in most European countries it is below the replacement level.  We are dying, and the only way to reverse this is to wake up and realize the truth before it is too late and we just walk off the pages of history.  We&rsquo;re too great a race to be conned into committing collective racial suicide.  We must collectively wake up now.  Right now.</p>

		<p>I really get irked by whites who claim there&rsquo;s some kind of conspiracy to keep talented white athletes out of sports. It&rsquo;s the flipside of black paranoia about&hellip;well just about every other endeavor including sports management. If blacks dominate sports it&rsquo;s because they are very good at sports. If whites dominate science and engineering and flying F-16&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s because, well, you get the picture.</p>

		<p>I used to think it was awful and terrible that sports used to be segregated. No longer. Besides marathons, look at basketball, with a race that is 13% of the population occupying something like 90% of NBA positions. Whether you attribute this to black superiority in basketball or a kind of pernicious affirmative action, it&rsquo;s obviously grossly unfair to whites.</p>

		<p>There is no conspiracy to keep whites out of sports.  No one is trying to hypnotize the white race into believing that they are inferior to any other race. Blacks are just faster runners - thats about it.  Whites are faster swimmers.  Whites can deadlift more than any other group.  Whites make better quarterbacks.  </p>

		<p>Until recently, each race was more-or-less genetically isolated.  As a result, each race evolved differences.  Africans evolved to be good at running, jumping and breeding.  Europeans and NE Asians evolved to be good at thinking and building workable civilizations.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the skills possessed by Aricans are mostly unneeded in modern civilization. There is little benefit (and great cost) to haveing them live among us.  </p>

		<p>A great disadvantage of having Africans live among us is that they do tend to be great athletes, and as such they out-compete our White children in sports.  Sports are important in developing maturity, confidence, wisdom, fitness, a work ethic, and a sense of fair play.  We need to have such opportunities for our children and for the future of our society.  Yet, many of our children have been denied those successes   &mdash;   just go to any high school or college sports event and look at the racial makeup.  This is just one more exapmple of how Diversity harms us. Every Black NBA player represents a talented White kid who never got to play pro-ball.<br/>

<p>Would it be wrong to say not so much superior but different?</p>
<p>Run faster, jump higher, throw further, take a punch better, begin to crawl at an earlier age, raise their heads up and look at their surroundings at an earlier age when a baby, better visual acuity, more readily able to pick out movement against a background and also see the spin on a baseball as it is being thrown toward them, mature at an earlier age and mature faster and more so when they do. NOT necessarily better but DIFFERENT?</p>

		<p>Well since this discussion seems to be about race and athletic ability, I often wonder where the Tarahumara tribe would fit into this. I seem to recall years ago reading that one or some of them ran in a regualr marathon, but didn&rsquo;t end up near first place. His (their?) response was that the marathon course was &#8220;too short&#8221;. Made sense to me since they run courses through their mountainous homeland that cover hundreds of miles. Now that would be something to see if they stuck a Kenyan in the middle of an event like that.</p>

		<p>Kenyan distance runners are very different anatomically from whites.  In my observations they have a very rigid longitudinal arch in the foot and a much more prominent heel (calcaneus).  Additionally, many have a forward tilt of the pelvis with an accentuated lumbar curvature.  </p>

		<p>If you consider EVERY possible sporting contest, and use participants from all age groups you would find that whites are clearly dominant.  Winter olympics?  ANYTHING involving watersports?  Basketball is the one that irks me.  Too many people focus only on the professional level, the NOT basketball association or D1 colleges.  At all other levels White players do equally as well as or better than Blacks.  I have seen hundreds of examples of this.    </p>

		<p>One of the problems is that a man can gain wealth and glory by bouncing a ball or running through the streets, whereas mental exertions might go unnoticed. We&rsquo;re not just allowed to but we&rsquo;re <i>encouraged</i> to heap praise upon athletes while identifying them by race, but we&rsquo;re not permitted to comment on racial disparities in intelligence or point out the oftentimes astounding accomplishments of white people. </p>

		<p> The Duke of Wellington is often quoted as saying that &#8220;The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton&#8221;. Today that quote is used to refer to the character-building that can result from sports. For our society, we need our children to participate in sports. </p>
<p>However, the tens of millions of Africans living among us have stolen that &#8220;experience&#8221; from our children and our society.  I want MY children to play on the school team, and I want African children to play on school teams back in Africa.  I don&rsquo;t want my child sitting on the bench, or not even trying out for the team, because our government just imported and dumped another ten-thousand Africans into my state. The same goes for physicians and engineers: why would I want my children to be out-competed by the importation of foreigners?  If Chinese and Indians want to be Physicians and engineers, more power to you.  Just do it in China or India.  White people built this nation and there is no reason why we should yank away our children&rsquo;s future, and give it to foreign invaders </p>

I, on the other hand, have found blacks and white liberals to be reluctant to talk about the obvious fact that blacks do tend to dominate many sports. If they acknowledge that this dominance is due to native talent it will be more difficult to blame black under representation in other fields to racial discrimination.<br/>
 <br/>
In order to earn one&rsquo;s living as a professional athlete one needs to be one of the best in the country. This is not true of the professions. It is why athletic ability is much less important than academic ability. </p>

		<p>Compared to Whites, Blacks have narrower hips which gives them a more efficient stride. They have a shorter sitting height which provides a higher center of gravity and a better balance. They have wider shoulders, less body fat, and more muscle. Their muscles include more fast twitch muscles which produce power. Blacks have from 3 to 19% more of the sex hormone testosterone than Whites or East Asians. The testosterone translates into more explosive energy&hellip; <br/>
 <br/>
By age five or six, Black children excel in the dash, the long jump, and the high jump, all of which require a short burst of power. By the teenage years, Blacks have faster reflexes, as in the famous knee-jerk response&hellip;<br/>
 <br/>
The reason why Whites and East Asians have wider hips than Blacks, and so make poorer runners is because they give birth to larger brained babies. During evolution, increasing cranial size meant women had to have a wider pelvis. Further, the hormones that give Blacks an edge at sports makes them restless in school and prone to crime.<br/>

		<p>I agree with Anonymous #5 and #10. Kenyans and Ethiopians are good distance runners, but you don&rsquo;t see them in the sprints, nor do you see them in the field events. Whites dominate the throwing events, such as shot put, javelin, and discus. They are also competitive in longer distance events, but not quite up to the level of the Kenyans and Ethiopians. Descendants of west Africans dominate sprint events and jumping events because they are faster, on average. Whites overwhelmingly dominate swimming. People differ. There&rsquo;s no conspiracy here. I see sports as an ideal because people succeed on the basis of their merits, which is as it should be throughout life. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sad to see fewer white people in professional sport, &amp; even sadder they think can no longer compete. I read that sprinters of West African heritage hit an oxygen wall later than Europeans, and East Africans who make great long distance runners all come from a very small genetic group in Kenya. Maybe they do have an advantage, but it&rsquo;s probably due to white parents wanting their children to have &#8216;proper&rsquo; jobs &amp; not encouraging sport outside of school years.</p>

		<p>The Kenyan won the race because he deserved to win. He was the best runner. Blacks are usually better runners than whites, as whites are usually better swimmers and skiiers. Should we initaite a racial quota for the Boston Marathon? Too many blacks have won. It&rsquo;s time to award a slow white person first place, even though he did not actually win the race. I know I sound ridiculous, but I think it is much more ridiculous to promote underqualified people as doctors, military officers, fire chiefs, etc based on racial quotas. </p>

		<p>I happened to see an article on the online Telegraph yesterday that features the UK&rsquo;s 2012 Olympic hopefuls.  Five out of seven were black.  National representation at the Summer Olympics is a joke, as are the national professional teams.  The U.S. started this by allowing blacks into the Olympics and other sports instead of maintaining and even promoting separate teams.  Sounds outrageous, but why doesn&rsquo;t African American sound as outrageous?  It is a subnationality that the tragic error of slavery in the American (and New World) colonies created.</p>
<p>White kids tend to automatically assume inferiority and forget the plethora of sports that whites have an advantage in.  Where are all the black bicyclists?  This has been discussed on Amren before.</p>

		<p>The approximately one-year earlier onset of sexual maturity among blacks confers an advantage in sports roughly comparable among whites to having one&rsquo;s child start first grade at age seven than at age six.</p>
<p>Quoting from a survey of studies on maturation rates:</p>
<p>&#8220;Several studies of boys in the 1970s and 1980s &hellip; found that African American boys were taller and heavier and matured earlier than white boys of the same age &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently published data from the Bogalusa Heart Study on secular trends in the heights of children found height increases among  9- to 12-year-old African American boys from 1973 to 1992 to be almost twice as large as those among white boys.  Because of a lack of a secular trend for increasing height among the 15- to 17-year-old children in the study, the authors suggest that there has been an increase in the rate of maturation rather than final height.&rdquo;<br/>
  &#8220;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;These NHANES [Estimates From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey] III data indicate significant differences among white, African American, and Mexican American boys in the age of onset of pubertal characteristics; African American boys showed pubic hair growth approximately 9 months earlier than white boys&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;there was a difference of 1 year between white or Mexican American boys and African American boys in the age at completion of genital development, with the latter being younger.&#8221;</p>

<p>COMMENT: Early maturation of blacks and therefore of superior muscular and skeletal development to that of same-age whites probably discourages many whites (and Asians and Hispanics) from competing in sports.  To the extent to which sports are important to development, whites (and Asians and Hispanics) suffer from being too-early placed in direct competition with blacks. </p>

		<p>The Kenyans could be juiced up. The drug testing in third world countries may be less stringent. Are people even tested for the Boston Marathon? Different cultures have differing attitudes towards cheating. If there is a genetic advantage in some races as opposed to others, maybe would should not have integrated sports because it is automatically unfair.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind that blacks seem to excel at physical endeavors like sports.  The real point is that all children, black and white, should participate in sports for the simple reason it builds their bodies, their team consciousness, and their minds (through better oxygenated brains).  What I DO mind is that professional sports players get payed an obscene amount of money.  And I mean truly obscene.  Along with that, the mindless lemmings who worship sports and the sports figures, bug me.  Does it really come as any surprise that the DWL&rsquo;s and blacks demand over-representation in the ONE thing blacks can do well - sports?  As others have said - blacks do well with things that enable them to survive in the jungle - run, jump, etc.  Whites do well in things that build civilizations.  We should all each keep to our natural environments.  </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that the fastest athletes in the world are black, yet blacks claim they have no access to anything that makes them healthy? Amazing how many issues blacks talk about out of both sides of their mouth at the same time, and moreover, how no one calls them on it.</p>

		<p>Could it be that the Kenyans dominate long distance<br/>
running because it is a poor nation and long distance <br/>
running is the most affordable sport? <br/>
This result in a large percentage of the population<br/>
participating in running thus more chance to have the <br/>
gifted runners representing the country.<br/>
If the African had not participated in marathons,<br/>
the stereotype would be the opposite of what it is today<br/>
as blacks outside of Africa dont fare well in<br/>
this type of race.  </p>

It&rsquo;s NOT blacks. Nor is it all Africans.  Africa is a huge continent, with many different peoples. </p>
<p>In this case, these runners are tall, lanky, long-limbed  East Africans from the deserts and highlands of Kenya/Ethiopia. They evolved for this sort of thing. They are not lowland jungle people. They are not Bantus like many other Africans. It is entirely an anatomical matter. I remember this  being discussed in anthropology class (years ago, before political correctness took over and made it taboo).</p>
<p>A poster above mentioned the Tarahumara runners from Mexico. Interesting thought.  I would like to see these Kenyans stacked against some Incan long-distance runners from Peru or Bolivia. Btw, is there any other industry or economic activity in Kenya other than  runners?   Bizarre!  Eliminate (or close to foreigners) these American marathons and you&rsquo;d eliminate Kenyan&rsquo;s claim to fame (and a lot of their national income).</p>
<p>Prior to the new univeralist  (Marxist) ideologies that took over after WW2, coupled with  the emancipation of Europe&rsquo;s African colonies, Ethiopians were proud of making the point, and even of carefully boasting, that unlike other  Africans THEY WERE NOT BLACKS. Look at any of the literature prior to the 1960s.</p>
<p>Oh, also, I find it extremely interesting (and rarely remarked on) that ALL of these sports which they have taken over  were invented by whites for whites! <i> ALL </i> of them.</p>
<p>Since they were invented by whites, they shuld be kept for whites. Just as there are separate mens&rsquo; and womens&rsquo; events, due to physical/anatomical differences, there should be separate racial events. Is that not only fair and logical?  </p>
<p>Otherwise,  to make the nonsense consistent,  abolish the womens&rsquo; events and throw everyone in together.</p>

<p>Why do we continue to read nonsense like this here?  Poster after poster, even on Amren,  has been so brainwashed that they have actually come to believe this stuff!</p>
<p>True, some blacks are very physically fit specimens. But so are some whites, every bit  as much so.  </p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how many scrawny, sickly, or grossly obese many blacks are? They are everywhere!  The physically fit ones  are the tiny minority.  Yet, some unthinking whites continue to worship them as the physically superior race.  Sheer idiocy!</p>

		<p>If that tail wind was a head wind, Ryan Hall would have had a shot.<br/>
The same anatomical advantage they possess, would have worked against them going into the wind. They can run like the wind going with it, but not against it. That tail wind sure helped me run my 16th straight Boston, and qualify to run my 17th. A 60 year old white guy, and his twin sister running her 15th Boston, also in for next year.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really get irked by whites who claim there&rsquo;s some kind of conspiracy to keep talented white athletes out of sports. It&rsquo;s the flipside of black paranoia about…well just about every other endeavor including sports management. If blacks dominate sports it&rsquo;s because they are very good at sports. If whites dominate science and engineering and flying F-16&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s because, well, you get the picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The colleges in their recruiting process, discriminate against talented White high school athletes.  The NFL discriminates big-time against White in almost every position except Quarterback, and that position is going fast.  If I&rsquo;m not mistaken the NBA just got some sort of &#8220;diversity&#8221; award.  Giving a sport that is over 80% Black, a &#8220;Diversity&#8221; award is an &#8220;In your face&#8221; blatant hypocrisy, that should be obvious to all but the most intellectually challenged (mostly all of them) multiculturalist liberal.  </p>

		<p>Kenyan runners got an awful lot faster after Dr. Gabriel Rosa visited their country and started training their athletes (early 1990&rsquo;s). Dr. Rosa was implicated in a number of doping scandals in professional cycling in Europe before that.  It&rsquo;s naive to believe that the Kenyans are clean athletes, particularly when so many have been busted for doping in recent years.</p>
<p>The same is true of sprinting.  Black record-holders in the 100m dash are routinely busted for doping, and have been for the last 25 years.  They all look like bodybuilders, yet people still believe that they are &#8220;natural&#8221; athletes.  Where are all the white male sprinters who are busted for PED&rsquo;s? Why don&rsquo;t they look like bodybuilders (Jeremy Wariner, Christophe Lemaitre, etc)?  If whites are naturally less fast, shouldn&rsquo;t you expect them to be doping at alarming rates to try to catch up?  Yet that isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>Black superiority in sports is as manufactured as the phony black superiority in music and other popular culture.  It is a result of black athletic stars being allowed to take PED&rsquo;s and set records while their white counterparts are tested more rigorously. Even if some blacks are caught, there are 10 times more who aren&rsquo;t.  And people keep defending the records and the Black Athletic Myth.  Before the onset of PEDs in track and field in the 1960&rsquo;s, whites ran just as fast or faster than blacks, and held most sprinting and running records. Now whites (men in particular) have almost been shut out of track. And the phony black superiority in track and field has been used as a reason to fill the NFL and NBA with &#8220;athleticly superior&#8221; blacks, excluding whites.  I don&rsquo;t believe the blacks are less talented than whites in athletics, but I don&rsquo;t believe that they are more talented either.  </p>
<p>By the way, the same corporations and governments actively discrminating against whites to the advantage of every other race are the same ones paying for and promoting these sports and athletes.  Why would you expect their actions here to be any different than their actions in other areas?  I just think people are very naive.</p>

		<p>The problem here is that there&rsquo;s an overemphasis on traditional American sports (ie: basketball, baseball, football, track &amp; field) when Whites actually dominate most world sports, especially SOCCER, which is by far the most watched and played on the planet.  The reigning World and European champion is Spain, and there isn&rsquo;t one single black player on that team whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, the only signicantly multi-racial team in the FIFA Top 10 is Brazil, and that&rsquo;s because it has mulatto players.</p>
<p>Moreover, where are/were the black Roger Federer, Pete Sampras, and Rafael Nadal in tennis, Lance Armstrong and Miguel Indurain in cycling, Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz in swimming, or Vasily Alexeev and Matthias Steiner in weightlifting ?  And what about other popular world sports like RUGBY, HOCKEY, GYMNASTICS, SKIING, MARTIAL ARTS, and on an on ?  </p>
<p>Sorry, but that so-called black dominance in sports is just another myth from the multiracial American media for most of us outside the USA, and White Americans really need to stop buying it already&hellip;my 02 cents.<br/>

		<p>It&rsquo;s funny that once I was in a race relations chat room and I was arguing with a Black guy that India is superior to Africa and the only comebacks he came up with were 1) India has NEVER won a gold medal in the Olympics and African nations win all the time and <br/>
2) Indians &#8220;be weak&#8221; working for the white outsourcing white nations while Africans are too strong and independent to work for the white man. He said that Indians are too weak to fight also.</p>
