<h1>Refugees Set Italian Church on Fire</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Voice of Russia, April 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tunisian refugees have set on fire a church at Lampedusa Island, Italy. No details of this incident have yet been revealed.</p>
<p>For some days, the situation on the island has been very tense. Local residents were unsatisfied by the torrent of Tunisian refugees, while the latter complained of poor accommodation conditions.</p>
<p>The church was set on fire after the priest had accommodated 36 teenage refugees in the parish.</p>

<p>Well how do you feel now &#8220;priest&#8221;? This is how they repayed your misguided kindness. This is what will happen to all of Europe because of do gooders like you. Couldn&rsquo;t have happened to nicer person</p>

<p>Just goes to show you that no good deed done for muslims goes appreciated. The priest is fortunate not to have been burned along with the church which is usual muslim SOP.</p>

		<p>Look East. Putin did it right. A Russian nationalist who gets the minority vote by pushing nationalism covertly, maintaining a neo-nazi opposition while marginalizing liberal &amp; muslim extremist opposition and keeping pan-Turkism down in C. Asia by paying lip service to Turko-Russian &#8216;brotherhood&rsquo; and Russia&rsquo;s status as a Muslim (but not Islamic) country. WNs in the West take note.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been posting a lot lately about the flood of refugees invading the island of Lampedusa over the last few weeks. The first arrivals were first from Tunisia, while more recent migrants have come from Libya.</p>
<p>The latest antics of these culturally-enriched guests of the Lampedusans involved setting fire to a guest house where they had been sheltered at the expense of a charitable organization. The news report below from Russia wrongly identifies the building as a church:<br>

<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>I have to agree with you there - Putin has been the lone bright spot for White leaders who are actually in power. Putin and the Russians won the 2nd Chetnian war against Muslim throat cutters and NATO and the Neo Con US didn&rsquo;t do to Russian then what they did to the Serbs. Putin also took down the worst Oligarchs, putting the most prominent, anti Nationalist in to a public cage. Like to see some Republican in the US do that to the Wall Street shysters that pawned off the whole sub prime mortgage meltdown on the US tax payer bailout.</p>
<p>Russia and Central and Eastern Europe are definitely going up and don&rsquo;t have many or really any of the corruptions of post World War II USA, Western Europe.</p>
<p>If you doubt this conclusion, just read up on how the Russian navy handles Somalian pirates and how US and Western nations handle the same.</p>

		<p> Yes, these malicious immigrants are destroying Italy&rsquo;s great heritage. I wonder how long it will be before they attack Italy&rsquo;s art treasures, many of which are related to Christianity or Pagan Rome. It is obvious that they hold views antithetical to most native Italians and shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed in the country. </p>

		<p>Feed them steak and cake.<br>
Then send them home.<br>
Simply make it clear (by sinking their boats as soon as they unload) that they are not welcome in Italy or it&rsquo;s sovereign territories and what they do to sustain themselves in Tunisia or Libya is not Europe&rsquo;s concern.<br>
Why does a revolution in a given country of necessity become a humanitarian crisis for all others these days?<br>
It wasn&rsquo;t in 1776.  Or in 1789.  Or in 1917.<br>
We did not &#8216;save&rsquo; Vietnam or Cambodia or Cuba or Hungary or Czechoslovakia or Poland from the consequences of revolution with themselves or their sovereign governments.<br>
It is time we applied the same rules to the ROW as we have traditionally held ourselves to.<br>
No need to get mad about it.  Just protect our interests as our populace.</p>

		<p>Am I crazy?  I pray every day for torpedoes, snipers in towers, mine fields and electrified fences.  The third world and minority populations along with their white enablers have destroyed this country.  Let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s over.  We can try to keep ourselves as safe as possible and pray for our posterity.  They will become the new White South Africans and White Rhodesians.    </p>

		<p>All European nations have to do in cases such as these is fire some warning-shots at any foreign vessels laden with refugees, give them time to turn around after the shots, then if they don&rsquo;t, fire apon them. If European nations could actually demonstrate in forceful ways that they are no-longer an easy target or a &#8216;soft-touch&rsquo; they would stay away. Make it harder for them.<br>
As for these Tunisians (and their neighbours) they created this mess all on their own. Let them clean it up, it has nothing to do with Italy, or any other European country. Oh, and Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the United States as well.</p>

		<p>Personally, I feel the navies of white nations should obliterate these boats third world invaders are using to invade the west then genocide the native population out of existence. Aircraft should strafe them, navy vessels should rip them apart with bursts from Gatling guns and naval artillery. Any survivors in the water should then be finished off then left for bait.</p>
