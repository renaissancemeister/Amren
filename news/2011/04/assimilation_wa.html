<h1>Assimilation Was Never Intended</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ray Lin, Richmond Review, March 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In D.M. North&rsquo;s March 4 letter (&#8220;Lessons on integration&#8221;), the letter-writer once again brought up the assimilation topic. While the letter-writer did present some valid reasons of why the Chinese in Richmond would not practice English, unfortunately the biggest reason was left out in his article.</p>
<p>The truth may be shocking for some, but I feel a frank but honest discussion is more healthy than being polite but hypocritical: For many of the Chinese in Vancouver, becoming Canadian was never a reason why we moved here, nor do we have the desire to do so. Rather, we see ourselves as Chinese expatriates, living in Canada for a short-term purpose, be it providing our kids to an easier education environment, setting up a business, or even just taking a long vacation.</p>
<p>Much like many Canadians who spend some years living overseas and eventually return to their homeland, a lot of us would just spend several years in Canada and eventually return to Asia. With that mindset in mind, it would be silly to think that many expatriates would actually take the effort and learn a foreign language, in this case English.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many Chinese simply see Canada as a vacation home, allowing them to come for a couple of months every year and enjoy Canada&rsquo;s great outdoors after a year of hard work in China. Much like many Americans who have a vacation home in Mexico, would anyone actually expect these Americans to take learning Spanish seriously? Rather, the Americans would expect the area where his Mexican vacation home is located to be an English friendly environment, and the same goes for us Chinese expatriates, and this has made Richmond the way it is today, catering to Chinese expatriates like me and many others.</p>
<p>I really do hope the Canadians can come to the realization that we are here not because we wanted to be Canadian, but simply because we like the resource this country provides to us. Much like many of your ancestors who came to this land, not because of they wanted to become natives, but because they desire the resources and opportunities in this land.</p>
<p>So please, my friends, set your expectations right.</p>

		<p>The writer of this letter is refreshingly honest and I must commend him for being so forthright.  We who call ourselves conservatives and have a racial consciousness have long suspected that to the Chinese immigrant, Canada is just a nice place to hang their hats for a while.  They have the money to buy large houses in the Vancouver area, put their kids into school and take advantage of our free medical system.   Having moved into a neighbourhood that is filled with Chinese, they need not learn the English language.   They have their own Chinese newspapers, radio stations and stores of every kind which cater to Chinese buyers.   Of course, as many of them have admitted, in a socialist country such as Canada, they cannot make the kind of money they were raking in back in Hong Kong or the Chinese mainland.   So, they come and go as they please and Canada to them is nothing more than a mailing address.  This is what happens when liberal governments enact Official Multiculturalism and encourage immigrants to cling to their own language and culture rather than assimilating.</p>

<p>Amazing  &mdash;  to so openly admit that you are only interested in taking advantage of others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like many of your ancestors who came to this land, not because of they wanted to become natives, but because they desire the resources and opportunities in this land.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the statement that made my jaw drop.  This is among the most genuinely STUPID statements I&rsquo;ve ever seen in print.  Did he think this through?  </p>

<p>Canada is not a third-world country that depends on your tourist dollars.  Educating your kids or setting up a business is not a &#8220;vacation&#8221;.<br>
It&rsquo;s an obvious attempt to put a different spin on Chinese colonization.</p>

		<p>Not one single nonwhite race will ever assimilate to a White society or nation. They can&rsquo;t. It is not in their genes! Only Whites are foolish enough to believe that everyone can assimilate and live happily ever after. A bunch of bozos. </p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t EVER want these races to &#8220;assimilate&#8221; ( I want them out of here!) and it makes me sick to hear these stupid neocon talk show hacks say that over and over again&hellip;.just assimilate and become one of &#8220;us&#8221;, they say&hellip;. Good grief!</p>

<p>At any rate, it should be read by every white liberal around the US. They actually think the recent immigrants who brandish Mexican/ Dominican/ Jamaican etc. flags are sentimental, patriotic Americans who love their new homeland.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think that very many of them plan on leaving.  Here, they are a privileged class, even above Whites.  They have their own towns, they can live as Chinese as they like, and yes, they don&rsquo;t even need to learn English.  In China, they&rsquo;re just another man in the street.  Ask yourself, do the Chinese who own the Phillipines and a good chunk of the rest of Southeast Asia go home?  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a &#8220;catch22&#8221; situation. If the native Canadians are so foolish as to give their territory away, why would sane people want to become Canadians. I regard lin as a dangerous enemey, but one I am constrained to empathize with. </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re doing this bc they have permission from the state. Before WW2, E.Asians were very enthusiastic about assimilating and miscegenating bc that&rsquo;s what the state demanded. In Serbia, there are 50 000 Chinese temp. residents who cant buy land and are without citizenship and who must live in designated areas, assimilation is discouraged and they tow the line bc our state demands it.</p>

		<p>I used to live in the Vancouver area, and after having experienced what&rsquo;s it like to be a member of a white minority, I moved away and resolved never to move back. Back in the late 1990s, I remember giving a training course to some folks at a Vancouver-based organization. There was a woman there who hailed from China - she worked in an overseas office. During the break, we chatted, and she mentioned that many Hong Kong residents had taken out Canadian citizenship, but had gone back to Hong Kong to work, although they planned to retire in Canada. The reason being that they didn&rsquo;t want to pay Canadian taxes, but they intended to take full advantage of Canada&rsquo;s subsidized public health system when they were in their old age. That story sums up perfectly how Hong Kong residents view Canada&hellip; as a place to suck dry all the public benefits possible but under no circumstances provide any contribution to funding those benefits.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s obvious this guy&rsquo;s a fake.  He&rsquo;s pretending to be a Chinese.  But I suspect he&rsquo;s someone who may be opposed to Asian immigration and wants to portray the community in a bad light.  His opinion is so offensive and over-the-top that it&rsquo;s incredible the newspaper decided to publish this.  A more discerning editor would&rsquo;ve written this off as a nonsensical drivel that it is.</p>
<p>The truth is, Chinese (and other East Asians) value Western education and the English language because they feel that it will offer them better career opportunities.  Some older Chinese may feel that learning English may be too difficult, but you can bet that their children are busily absorbing English and Western culture at school.  </p>
<p>I hope that readers at Amren are intelligent enough not to succumb to instintive reactions and judge this so-called letter objectively and ask the basic question, &#8220;If I were Chinese, would I actually write this letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<p>In spite of the civil tone of this letter, there is a growing testiness in the relationship between whites and Chinese in Canada. </p>
<p>The Chinese now know their own strength; they have become pushy in their demands.  They cite the flimsy historical argument that whites pillaged China and aboriginal North America, and therefore we have no &#8216;moral right&rsquo; to resist them setting up a parallel Chinese society. </p>
<p>This is extrapolated into a manifest destiny argument to justify Chinese expansion into North America.</p>
<p>Things are going to get far worse if the economy nosedives, and China decides it must &#8216;protect&rsquo; its citizens abroad.   </p>

		<p>I see no reason why the Chinese should assimilate into a culture they rightfully see as inferior to their own. I mean, would you expect white people in Africa to assimilate into mainstream black African culture? Just look at the fine white neighbours they have in Hongcouver:</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>This astonishingly frank admission confirms that there are many reasons why people migrate, not always  having any desire to be permanent or to assimilate. They are looking for what serves them best, not necessarily what serves the host country best.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t very much care about the host country,  which for them is just &#8220;a vacation spot&#8221;. For the rich it is also a convenient place to stash their extra cash, to get good educations for their children,  good medical services, and (especially) a handy place to have a second citizenship in case something goes bad in the mother country. (You never know in the Third World.)</p>
<p>The receiving countries often fail, or refuse, to believe this, keeping their heads  deliberately in the sand, thinking they are receiving loyal immigrants who are eager to become citizens. Silly fools!</p>

<p>I have to disagree with you on that. During the 19th century, many immigrants  from Europe came here only intending to work for a number of years, save some money, and then go back home to buy a farm or start a business. And some actually did go back.</p>
<p>However, given the enormous distantances, time and expense involved in travel back then, many of them, only intending to be temporary, ended up being permanent. </p>
<p><br>
Incidentally, regarding the subject of Chinese assimilation,  does the Canadian government learn NOTHING from history?   It has only to look at the examples of expat Chinese living among kindred peoples in SE Asia. They have been there for CENTURIES, but still regard themselves as Overseas Chinese living abroad. (And so does the Chinese government regard them as such.)  </p>
<p>If they have not assimilated even among fellow  Asians, what gives foolish Canadians  (and Americans) the notion that they will assimilate here into a totally foreign race and cuture?</p>

		<p>Nonsense. My friend from China (mainland) said she was looking forward to assimilating into Canadian society, she said the Chinese are less polite than Canadians. Other things she said included pollution, and the whole communism thing. I agree with the commenter that its more about old vs. new generations.</p>

		<p>Why should they assimilate? They are advanced elements of the Chinese invasion force that will slaughter Americans of all races while the ruling class cheers. I despise the Chinese just as much as I despise Mexicans, because they are arming the drug cartels with grenades and other weapons which have already been used to kill Americans.</p>

		<p>I had some Canadian  friends from Vancouver. They were totally liberal, in a nonchalant way&hellip;there was no option for them. <br>
They kind of hated America. Nice folks, but deluded to the core. Intelligent but profoundly unwise. Gentle and urbane, but espousing beliefs that would one day bring havoc and destruction.<br>
They also spoke of how perverse the Japanese were&hellip;you can do your own research into some of the sexist practices there, and the downright creepy sexual stuff to know what the cannucks meant. (If half of what they said is true, I&rsquo;d concur, it&rsquo;s ultra- creepy).</p>
<p>Yet they had no apparent cognitive dissonance over being openly multicultural.<br>
Mind- boggling.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t wish them any harm at all, but I gotta&rsquo; say, such socialists, who drive Lexus and high-dollar VWs, really can&rsquo;t be fit to survive in a world where they&rsquo;d really have to fend for themselves. <br>
Like those poor birds in New Zealand that had no genetic awareness of predation, that they could be snatched or clubbed immediately by men, made into food without a struggle.<br>
Really, for such people, if the effects of racial diversity ever spilled into anarchy and terror, the most humane thing might be a visit from good old Doctor Kevorkian. Which would be appropriate, the Liberals being such fans of the right to die. I just wish they&rsquo;d limit that outcome  TO THEMSELVES!</p>

<p>Here in the USA, no wonder why the only legal restrictions against foreign-born, naturalized Americans is that they cannot be President or Vice-President.  The men wrote the Constitution wanted to make sure as much as possible, that anyone in the office of the Presidency Vice-Presidency would not have any conflicting loyalties to any foreign powers.  </p>
<p>With the way that not all naturalized Canadian citizens are completely loyal to Canada, as shown in this article, this is surely a good example.</p>

		<p>Poster #10 - I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure. I personally know of many Chinese who live the exact same sort of lifestyle that the author of the article describes. The business side of things often remains in Asia, and the western country (Canada/USA/Australia, usually) is merely a 2nd home, a place to lead a healthier lifestyle, take advantage of the abundant social security benefits, and provide the kids with a far less competitive environment to grow up in. But there are rarely misgivings about who they are and where their loyalties lie.</p>
<p>I would agree that the tone of the article is slightly provocative, but maybe the guy really is just being brutally honest, with a dash of national pride mixed in (ie, overcompensating for the fact that there&rsquo;s a perception out there that they&rsquo;d turn their back on the &#8216;motherland&rsquo; so readily - a lot of Chinese seem to have a bit of an inferiority complex about this). </p>

<p>Maybe you should. White people shouldn&rsquo;t have any place in Hong Kong if you don&rsquo;t want them to be there. Hong Kong belongs to the Chinese, just as Denmark belongs (or should belong) to the Danes. If I was Chinese or Japanese or Korean I would be looking at Whites with incredible suspicion right now. A group of people that considers it a good thing to inundate itself with strange groups has to be sick in the head. Not a practice you want to emulate in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But I promise to visit you guys from time to time. Not to stay, just to say hi. I&rsquo;ll even send post-cards, since I like you guys. We can all get along but it&rsquo;s best if we just keep our houses separate, wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

<p>Maybe you should complain.  You definitely should if your government were pursuing a policy of reducing your people to a minority in your own country.  You definitely should if your culture, your civic institutions, even your right to exist as a people were all under attack.    </p>
<p>But since none of that is the case, since there is absolutely no danger of whites becoming a majority in Hong Kong, or ethnically cleansing your people from key societal institutions, or denying your people&rsquo;s right to exist, &#8220;maybe you should&#8221; quit comparing apples to oranges. Our respective circumstances aren&rsquo;t remotely comparable.      <br>

<p>Back in the early 1970&rsquo;s, when Prime Minister Trudeau was strongly advocating for &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo;, one of his inner circle was a man named Lewis Perinbam, an East Indian. </p>
<p>Born in Malaysia and educated in Scotland, Perinbam would have had first-hand experience with the dysfunctional multiculturalism of his land of birth: indigenous tribes, Malays, Chinese, Indians, Persians, Arabs and British.</p>
<p>The future leaders of Canada (as well as the late Olof Palme) sought this man out for international advice.  </p>
<p>As we now know, multiculturalism was falsely presented at the time as a great, new way forward for white countries.  Those with experience in SouthEast Asia would have known better.</p>
<p>A most telling example was Perinbam himself, who married a white woman and was content to never return to his homeland, having fled to greener pastures in the white world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Chinese people are preferable by far, BY FAR, to blacks and muslims! Anyone disagree?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes and no.  Certainly Chinese people are preferable in that they do not have the astronomical crime rates of NAMs, and their level of economic productivity is far higher.  </p>
<p>But they will displace you just the same.  In large numbers, they will push whites out of entire cities and institutions. This is happening on the west coast in a big way, whether at the level of a university computer department that &#8220;goes Asian,&#8221; a high school, or entire regions.  </p>
<p>Their culture is not our culture, and just like other non-whites, they cannot be expected to embrace the traditional white icons, heroes and mythology.  Why would they? They aren&rsquo;t us.  </p>
<p>We are already getting a taste of this in their voting habits: though they meet the classic Republican profile (doctors, small businessmen, upwardly mobile) they vote overwhelmingly Democrat.  Why is that? </p>
<p>Hmmmm&hellip;a real brain teaser.  They aren&rsquo;t us.      </p>
<p>In large numbers, the stereotype of the polite Oriental goes out the window.  As people who have been around them will tell you, in large numbers they become very pushy.  And, if you so much as deign to criticize this behavior, in however mild a format, you&rsquo;re going to get death threats.  Death threats.  Just ask Ms. Wallace. Ah, sweet freedom of speech. Such mild mannered and polite Asians.      </p>
<p>I could go on and on, but the bottom line is quite simple:  Asian colonization of white societies is still colonization, and it will destroy our people just the same. In many ways, precisely because they are more capable, Asian colonization is far more dangerous to our survival as a people than are the NAMs.   <br>

		<p>16 Anon: You have every reason to object to any more than a few Whites taking up permanent residence in China, and I don&rsquo;t think many here would criticize China for expelling the foreigners.  I do think it reasonable for any civilized nation to tolerate a few selected outsiders, as long as they remember that they are guests, that their presence is beneficial to their hosts, and that they don&rsquo;t form their own enclaves.  But extending such tolerance is a matter for Chinese to decide, not Whites.  </p>

		<p>Whites on some occasions &#8216;go native&rsquo;- learning the language, putting on the robes, and eating with chopsticks or some other cultural fixture.  That said, it is extremely rare that a white wants to leave the white world completely.</p>
<p>It is more common for Asians to turn their back on their culture and language, marry a white, and try to meld into the white race through miscegenation.</p>
<p>Though some would call it an assimilation success story, it is the Asian or Arab trying to become white who presents the greatest danger to the future of the white race.</p>

		<p>I am an AMREN suppporter, and I live in Southern California. I live near various Asian communities&hellip;mostly Chinese and Vietnamese. The Vietnamese are often refugees or offspring of refugees from the war. They lean toward conservatism and even U.S. patriotism. Children of Asian immigrants rarely speak or study their parent&rsquo;s language. Some know it vaguely to communiciate with elders, but usually have no interest in their native languages. Asian children tend to like their skateboards, MTV, video games, etc, and are typically studious and career-oriented as they grow older. I see virulent anti-communist feeling in the Vietnamese community of Westminster. I see many American flags and South Vietnamese flags. I remember, about ten years ago, a shopkeeper displayed the flag of communist vietnam. A mob of angry Vietnamese people gathered around his store and threw bricks threw his window. They threatened his life until the police came and saved him. There is a Vietnamese supermarket in this community, that sells various Asian foods (strange to me). This supermarket displays a large American eagle over the entrance, under which reads &#8220;God bless America&#8221;.  Imagine that, in any neighborhood??? Many Asians near me seem to not only embrace assimilation, but even patriotism. An Asian friend of mine once told me, &#8220;showing us a communist flag or symbol is like showing a Jewish person a swatstika. We remember the torture&#8221;. A white person walking through an Asian neighborhood (Chinese, Japanese or Vietnamese, Korean, and similar) is relatively safe. White liberals aren&rsquo;t really sure how to handle this situation. They see Asians as a victim group, but how do they handle Asians who hate communism, and embrace Christianity and patriotism? It&rsquo;s a quandry for liberals. I am against mass immigration of foreign cultures, but it&rsquo;s interesting to see a foreign community that doesn&rsquo;t brazenly hate the U.S. and brutally attack whites.</p>

		<p>The issue is large scale immigration. Any group, and this includes Whites, who move into another group in large numbers will not assimilate. Sure you will have some that will, but the larger the numbers the less they will. A few Chinese will assimilate, same for Mexicans but huge amounts will not as a whole, assimilate.</p>

		<p>The analogy between whites in Mexico is spot on and 100% correct. I am a white guy who lived in Thailand for about 8 years. I never learnt the language, never wanted to learn the language, never felt the need to learn the language. I loved Thailand and Thai people but never wanted to assimilate or be part of them, I spent much of my time in areas that catered to English speakers and rarely went into the seriously Thai areas. I got along great with Thai people and adopted their manners and customs only the the point of not giving offense - but not one inch further. To this day I can barely speak a word of Thai. The idea of assimilating into Thai society and culture, even when I toyed with the idea of staying there for good, seemed absurd to me. I simply had no desier to do so - not necessarily because I thought Thais were &#8220;inferior&#8221;, but because I simply did&rsquo;t care, that&rsquo;s not what I was there for, and it was just too much trouble and effort. </p>
<p>I moved to Thailand simply and only to take advantage of a lifestyle that the country had to offer me, incuding low cost of living, and I do not feel one bit guilty or immoral about it, nor should I, nor shoulod anyone who does something similar. I was always polite and kind to my Thai hosts and that is all they ever got - or wanted - from me.</p>
<p>And guess what! There are MILLIONS of Americans and Europeans who do likewise all over the globe, and now apparently some Chinese as well. None of them are bad people for doing this.</p>
<p>If Thailand had offered me free medical care, I would have jumped a it. Of course I would have taken it, and STIL not assimilated! Why should I?</p>
<p>If Canada sees fit to offer all sorts of benefits to people who have no intention of assimilating, why shouldn&rsquo;t they take those benefits? The fault lies with the Canadians, not the Chinese immigrants. But the real problem seems to lie in the idea that the Canadian government seems to half believe that eventually, assimilation will happen wether or not the immigrants intend it. Will it? It might for the children - in Thailand, tons of children of expats who never intended to settle down will now be more Thai than anything else. So too, I would not be surprised if the children of these Chinese immigrants don&rsquo;t end up more Canadian than Chinese, despite the intentions of the parents.  </p>

<p>The Indians didn&rsquo;t have ANY problems opposing the invasion of their territory.  CERTAINLY no moral qualms (the very idea is preposterous IMO, but white Uncle Toms and &#8220;whites&#8221; certainly preen over them).  So neither should we.</p>

		<p>This guy doesn&rsquo;t know his Canadian history (and as he admits, why should he?)</p>
<p>The early French who came here &#8220;went Native&#8221; more often than not, simply for survival purposes.  The Natives knew how to deal with northern winters.  They knew where the food and the sought-after fur-bearers were.  The French simply realized that they could not live like they did back home, and it was easier to be taught by the red man than to learn on their own from scratch.  </p>
<p>This went on for the first few centuries of Canadian colonization, which is why, long before the railroad, there were French-speaking Metis in Manitoba and the prairies beyond.</p>
<p>Many early settlers to Canada were poor, with no intention of returning to their home countries, because they had nothing to return to.  Like the ancestors of many Australians, some of these settlers weren&rsquo;t here voluntarily, either, and weren&rsquo;t _allowed_ to go back home.  These people knew they would have to make it or break it, to live and die right here once they came.</p>
<p>These were my ancestors.</p>
<p>These early English and French (and to an extent, the invited Ukranians), are the ones who built Canada.  Chinese and others who came after found an already-established nation-state.  The Chinese are the loudest at trying to claim credit for &#8220;helping build Canada&#8221;, but they were nothing but scab labour (hence the Head Tax, put in place to protect Canadian workers from wage-slashing foreign scabs.)  The Sikhs, same thing.  The only thing they can say they built is a temple in Golden, BC.  Oooooo.</p>

If minorities thrive in your homeland more than you do, then you have a problem, not them. No restrictions or expulsions of minorities can be justified without a fair amount of high ground. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s on the same level as anti-white violence in Africa, with predictable results.</p>

     As for the Asian foreigners doing so well, there are two primary reasons.  One, because they are selected from the best educated classes of their respective countries.  Unlike Mexico, which exports its dregs, the Asian countries are expecting a return on their human investment here.  Two, they are allowed to cheat.  The IRS does not bother to inspect the books of small Asian businesses.  Nobody enforces anti-discrimination laws against Chinese, who never hire Blacks.  They have set new standards in academic cheating, forcing extraordinary measures to be taken to ensure the integrity of testing.  They are not Americans, and they simply see no reason to abide by our rules, especially since nobody forces them to.  They are brought hereby our rulers to be a technocratic elite, hired to keep the lights on as the country slides into Third World status.  They will provide the brainpower that the Blacks and Mexicans can&rsquo;t.  </p>

<p>That would be a true statement, if all things were equal, which they are not. A newly arrived, non-white immigrant steps off the bus with advantages over natives whites, especially white, able-bodied, heterosexual, Christian males. Toss in the fact that it is virtually verboten for said males to even gather in the same room to discuss working together to further their interests, let alone actually do it.</p>
