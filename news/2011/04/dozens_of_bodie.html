			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adriana Gomex Licon, AOL News, April 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Fifty-nine bodies were found buried Wednesday in a series of pits in the northern Mexico state of Tamaulipas, near the site where suspected drug gang members massacred 72 migrants last summer, officials said.</p>
<p>Security forces investigating reports that a passenger bus had been hijacked in the area conducted a raid that netted 11 suspected kidnappers and freed five kidnap victims.</p>
<p>Then they made a grisly discovery  &mdash;  a total of eight pits, containing a total of 59 corpses. One of the pits held 43 dead.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The area is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border at Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mexican drug cartels have taken to recruiting migrants, common criminals and youths, Mexican authorities say.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the victims found Wednesday were migrants. Migrants frequently travel by bus in Mexico/</p>
<p>But drug gunmen also operate kidnapping rings, and erect roadblocks on highways in Tamaulipas and other northern states, where they hijack vehicles and rob and sometimes kill passengers.</p>
<p>San Fernando is on a major highway that leads to the U.S. border.</p>
<p>Drug gangs across Mexico also sometimes use mass graves to dispose of the bodies of executed rivals.</p>

		<p>FoxNews reported this story, saying there were 400 (four hundred) bodies found in the mass grave.</p>
<p>59 dead bodies found in Mexico, does not sound particularly newsworthy.<br>

<p>What type of sick mind includes that line in an article to cover up what is obviously going on.  There is no &#8220;recruitment&#8221; going on.  People are being rounded up and enslaved.  Many of them are being shipped here to the US.</p>
<p>Those dead bodies this article is trying to convince you are of drug dealers on the losing side of conflict among rival gangs?  Who are those people?  I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip;.those are the ones who resisted.  Or maybe the ones that just weren&rsquo;t suited for slavery.  Too old, too sick, not strong enough to work a drug field or not pretty enough to get a good price from an American non-white pervert looking for his package deal of a prostitute and crack after selling his foodstamps at the local bodega.</p>
<p>Not only is it an outrage that this is going on.  But it is an even bigger outrage how everyone knows what this is and this Adriana Gomex Licon dares to lie about it.</p>
<p>Which is the bigger evil, the people who do these things or the vast network covering it up so that they can get away with it.</p>
<p>Is this what it has come down to.  Mexican activism in the US to ensure the welfare money keeps flowing into the drug empires so that their own people can be made into slaves and subjected to heinous crimes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from many racial realists that Mexicans and blacks have a strong racial consciousness and that coupled with a lack of racial consciousness among whites is the source of racist victimization of whites.</p>
<p>But I have to tell you, I see no evidence that Mexicans or blacks care about each other in even the most basic sense.  There is no humanity, let alone any brotherhood among them.</p>
<p>Haiti and New Orleans post Katrina reveals what they are.  Dead slaves dumped in pits while a reporter of the same race tries to somehow blame the victims (hey&hellip;.they must be executed &#8220;rivals&#8221;).  That reveals what they are.  So does a lack of any demands that the US stop welfare money from flowing into the drug trade.</p>

		<p>Every time I see that an object I come across is &#8220;Made in Mexico&#8221; I have to wonder, &#8220;Is there any civilization left there at all?&#8221; </p>
<p>I realize the whole country is not like the town named in this story, but there&rsquo;s enough barbarity across the border that it makes you wonder. </p>
<p>Imagine if a mass slaughter like this occurred in this country. It would make the Jared Loughner story seem like an afterthought (especially if public officials&rsquo; heads were cut off like in some stories out of Mexico). It would be the biggest news story in this country for weeks, </p>
<p>In Mexico, it&rsquo;s just business as usual. And when Mexican immigrants in this country commit crimes, they have the nerve to say they were &#8220;corrupted&#8221; by American culture!</p>

<p>It is my understanding that certain cartels have such tight control over certain regions of Mexico that their power is virtually that of an established government.  They have so much power that they have de facto conscription (draft) power over young men.  I don&rsquo;t think they have to &#8220;recruit&#8221; much of anyone, because they can &#8220;convince&#8221; someone to join up pretty easily.</p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m not surprised by this increased mayhem and murder south of the Border. Recently, a young college girl of tender years was the only one who would run for mayor in a Mexican border town  &mdash;  everyone else was too scared to. Our government is more concerned with what&rsquo;s going on in Libya then on our own border. I predict the grisly massacres will move to the United States in the near future.</p>

		<p>I read different details between the lines than you folks, so call this a paranoid&rsquo;s insight-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Security forces investigating reports that a passenger bus had been hijacked in the area conducted a raid that netted 11 suspected kidnappers and freed five kidnap victims.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Someone with a radio tracking device was put on this traveling cattle truck, hoping to get caught and taken to the sight of defrocking, robbery and slaughter.  A crime that is never reported in a corrupt nation is one which can be repeated again and again and again.  Until you have proof.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
The area is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border at Brownsville, Texas.<br>
&hellip;<br>
It was unclear if the victims found Wednesday were migrants. Migrants frequently travel by bus in Mexico/<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Some kind of oblique messaging going on here.  A for-hire offer or a cough-up blackmail payment due perhaps.  The Federales are officialy pro-immigration if it takes their worst poverty victims off their hands.  The crime gangs don&rsquo;t care what happens or who pays them for what act.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want the lowest of the low in terms of Central American immigrants, pay us to make the problem disappear.  Here is our resume and our account number.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Mexican drug cartels have taken to recruiting migrants, common criminals and youths, Mexican authorities say.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t trust your own, an outsider is a good alternative.  They cannot speak or write Spanish.  You have their lives and possibly their wives along with whatever money they had saved up to make the journey north.</p>
<p>You can pay them next to nothing because their only alternative point of refuge is the Mexican Government who will likely beat and deport them, if they can understand what they are talking about.</p>
<p>And if they are outsiders they are likely not members of one of the other gangs.</p>
<p>This could be a sign of desperation.  Mafia families would never allow &#8216;business&rsquo; to become so public or desperate (read soldier losses) that they had to go outside their own to make up labor shortages.  A meeting of bosses would be arranged and a new apportionment of profits agreed to.</p>
<p>Which is the weakness of Mexican stupidity as klepto anarchism, even from/among their own.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
But drug gunmen also operate kidnapping rings, and erect roadblocks on highways in Tamaulipas and other northern states, where they hijack vehicles and rob and sometimes kill passengers.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Smart warriors (and criminals and revolutionaries) limit the footprint spread of their devastation to ensure that they do not make so many enemies that everyone allies against them like rabid dogs.</p>
<p>This can be true even if it is -other- DTOs that are doing the actual ravaging.</p>
<p>But if things get desperate, they will slaughter anyone and anything to stay alive and bus routes are easy because they are isolated and you cannot defend the whole line without becoming overt and all the &#8216;donators&rsquo; are conveniently packed together like sardines with no place to go and no local friends to offend.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Many of the protesters said the government offensive has stirred up the violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to end this war, because it is a senseless war that the government started,&#8221; said protester Alma Lilia Roura, 60, an art historian.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>Whoever is winning among the gangs or between the gangs and the Federales, the local civilians and their liberal elite sophist leadership are ready to throw in the towel.  Probably on cue to some socialist agenda.</p>
<p>If the white flag is taken up, en-masse, the government is finished and a merger with the DTOs will follow, after which, they will move north because profit comes from opportunity, not stability.</p>
<p>BUILD THE FENCE NOW!</p>

<p>You are probably thinking of Marisol Valles Garcia, a 20 year old woman who took over as Chief of Police of one of the municipalities of Chihuahua after no one else would dare to take the job.  Chihuahua shares a border with the US and Garcia&rsquo;s little slice of it is all border area&hellip;&hellip;and basically controlled by the drug lords.  </p>
<p>After being threatened with assassination, she abandoned her post, fled Mexico and is seeking asylum in the US.  This is not surprising as she doesn&rsquo;t have an actual police department under her.  Just a bunch of unarmed women.</p>
<p>One might want to ask why that is?  Why wouldn&rsquo;t Mexico station a few hundred battle hardened troops in such a dangerous and violent area.</p>
<p>They would, of course, if that area was under control of the Mexican government.  It&rsquo;s not.  Get it?</p>
