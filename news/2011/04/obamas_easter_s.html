			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jonathon M. Seidl, The Blaze, April 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The media stood and applauded yesterday when President Obama and his family went to church for Easter. Yesterday&rsquo;s visit to Shiloh Baptist Church in D.C. shows again that Obama really is a man of faith, the reports seem to suggest.</p>
<p>But while the media rushed to report on the first family&rsquo;s attendance of the predominately black congregation (and the family&rsquo;s outfits), what it failed to mention are the views held by the church&rsquo;s pastor. And while those views have not been delivered in the same fiery manner as Obama&rsquo;s former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, they sound eerily familiar.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During a speech last year at Eastern University, Smith rejected the idea that America is moving past race. In fact, he said racism is alive and rampant in America, especially on the conservative airways. Not only did he insinuate that Fox News hosts are racist, but he also said Rush Limbaugh is a new breed of KKK member:</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you know?  Barack Obama doesn&rsquo;t listen while he&rsquo;s in Church.  Even though he deliberately patronized Trinity UCC in Chicago and Rev. Wright precisely because he wanted to accumulate &#8220;street cred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the real Rush Limbaugh, that supposed &#8220;K-person,&#8221; said on his show today that his dream slate for Republican Presidential candidates are Allen West, Marco Rubio and Piyush (&#8220;Bobby&#8221;) Jindal, and also said good things about Herman Cain.  Oh great, two blacks, a a Hispanic and an Indian.  Not a real American among them.  With adversaries like that, Obama can sleep a little easier.</p>

		<p>Why is anyone surprized about this? This is who Obama is! What does he have to do, come into the oval office in a turban guarded by acouple of those bow tie clowns from the nation of islam? Did anyone really think that his election would bring an end to the constant howls of RACISIM! If anything, its gotten worse. When will White people wake up and realize that theres no pleasing these idiots. It&rsquo;ll NEVER happen, so stop trying!<br>
 Lets cut to the chase folks, I believe this President is a racist Islamist and is part of the Jihad. One of the main weapons of their &ldquo;Holy War&rdquo; is to lie about their faith and their beliefs and affiliations for &ldquo;The Cause&rdquo;.<br>
The sole purpose of alot of these &#8220;black churches&#8221; is to radicalize the black masses against this country and White people. Anytime I go into a black neighborhood I&rsquo;m amazed at the number of so called &#8220;Reverands&#8221; there are milling about, but very few acually preach the word of God. When was the last time anyone ever heard the &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Al or &#8220;Rev.&#8221; $harpton acually preach a real sermon?   </p>

		<p>The sooner whites (especially conservative whites) realize that most nonwhites and liberals mean &#8216;white&rsquo; and only white when they use the word &#8216;racist&rsquo;, the sooner most of us will ignore the accusations and not let the slur affect our careers and personal lives.  That&rsquo;s the most important thing of all</p>

		<p>I think we all would be really frightened if we could really read Obama&rsquo;s mind. &#8220;Birds of a feather flock together&#8221; - as they say. Surely he doesn&rsquo;t like white people, but to what extreme degree? Well, again, look at what his associates, pastors and friends are saying. It should scare even the most liberal whites.</p>

		<p># 1 - Why does Obama have to go to a black church?  Why not an asian, white or latino pastor?  Oh, he favors one race of christian over another.</p>
<p># 2 -  I have never heard a black preacher who had sound &#8216;book learnin&rsquo;.  Think of the ole timey bible preachers who studied for years and years and years, the greek manuscripts, the hebrew, the theologians of the past.  The black preacher is just a slick salesman selling his juju with &#8216;emotion&rsquo; and &#8216;feeling.&rsquo;  No deep adherance to christian scholastic tradition.  So they can say whatever they want.</p>
<p># 3 - Obama seems pretty secular and ambivalent about religion to me.  He only seems to have gotten &#8216;christian&rsquo; since he got into office back in the senate and now the president.  I doubt he was a &#8216;jesus-is-lord&rsquo; kinda guy in his 20s, 30s or 40s. </p>

		<p>Poster#2, James Crowe- you bring up an interesting point about your statistics in regards to kids born out of wedlock. I&rsquo;ve long felt that blacks were much more successful in society baxk in the &rsquo;60s. The model of the traditional family has decayed in the black community over the years. The &#8220;me first and me now&#8221; attitude has destroyed America&rsquo;s youth. This is seen no more clearly than in blacks. If any &#8220;leaders&#8221; in their community had any sense, they would embrace a similar title to this website. African American Renaissance. That&rsquo;s when blacks had a sense of pride and family values, which have long been replaced by glorifying gangsterism and mysogynism. </p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how the left belittles religion except for instances where it concerns non-whites?  It&rsquo;s as though the latter are children who must be humored.</p>

		<p>The media talking heads are debating today over whether or not Obama knew what this pastor was about, did his people vet this guy this guy before Obama attended his church and all the same irrelevant points they tossed around regarding Rev. Wright.  What they should be discussing is the fact that the majority of the Black community agree with Wright and Smith.  That is the elephant in the room conservative talk radio and Fox News need to address.</p>

		<p>Black clergymen need to understand that the civil rights movement is over. Their side won. Now they need to encourage blacks to live in accordance with Christian values. If they succeeded in that, what remains of &#8220;white racism&#8221; would disappear like the memory of a bad dream on a wonderful new day. </p>

		<p>I am not a fan of Rush Limbaugh. Nevertheless, one does not get places in politics by changing people&rsquo;s minds. One get&rsquo;s places by exploiting and directing sentiments that already exist. <br>
 <br>
Rush Limbaugh does not exploit hostility to Jews and Orientals. This is because there is little to exploit. This in turn is because the great majority of those people behave decently and perform adequately. </p>

		<p>Totally amazing. </p>
<p>A white president could NEVER attend a card game where someone said a bad thing about blacks.</p>
<p>This president got ELECTED, even though the reports and videos of his church&rsquo;s vile anti-white hatred were everywhere.</p>
<p>Now, he re-commits to it all.</p>
<p>Wow, is he arrogant. Wow, are white Americans stupid, cowed, and craven!</p>
<p>Of course, he&rsquo;s probably just attending church, because that&rsquo;s what a president still has to do on Easter and Christmas, etc. But his mind may well be elsewhere. My guess is he attends church because he has to, but he&rsquo;s &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real,&#8221; literally, by rubbing our faces in it, by going to openly racist, black nationalist churches. </p>
<p>Anyway, he knows the media still licks his boots, so he is in no danger&hellip;even that traitor McCain, won&rsquo;t call him out on anything that has clout.<br>
 <br>
This particular puppet president can do no wrong.</p>
<p>Still, unless the 2012 elections are TOTALLY rigged, I think Obama is going to be literally swept from office. (UGH, the Republicrats will probably beat him with a fake conservative LATINA who makes noises about being pro-life).</p>
<p>Wanna bet?</p>
