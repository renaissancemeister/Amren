			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Miriam Jordan, Wall Street Journal, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three McDonald&rsquo;s Corp. restaurant managers in Savannah, Ga., were charged Wednesday with selling identities stolen from U.S. citizens to prospective workers, a case that federal authorities say shows the risks employers are increasingly taking to mask the hiring of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Agents Wednesday arrested managers Oscar Lazo, 51 years old, a Peruvian national; Eva Ramos, 35, a U.S. citizen; and another unnamed manager, a Mexican citizen who was working under a stolen identity, at the restaurants. In addition to the managers, agents arrested nine immigrants at the restaurants and held two Mexican nationals, former employees of McDonald&rsquo;s in the area, at their homes.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t clear how the managers allegedly obtained the allegedly stolen identities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants, sometimes with the encouragement of their employers, are increasingly using the bona fide documents of legal residents or citizens of the U.S. to get hired.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson said that the Savannah case could be indicative of a new trend. As the federal government&rsquo;s &#8220;ability to investigate becomes better,&#8221; he said, enterprises that want to engage in illegal hiring are devising &#8220;more sophisticated methods&#8221; to avoid detection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The use of an electronic system that checks a person&rsquo;s work eligibility, called E-Verify, is now mandatory for employers in several states. And the system must also be used by companies that do business with the government. However, it cannot detect illegal hires using someone else&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If convicted on all counts, Mr. Lazo and Ms. Ramos face a maximum statutory penalty of more than 100 years in prison.</p>

		<p>IMHO, 99% of all successful identity theft could have never happened if the Federal government would enforce its own laws about Social Security numbers only being allowed as identification for Social Security purposes, either paying taxes or receiving benefits.  Because they don&rsquo;t, and everything and its cousin wants your SSN, stealing your SSN is the keystone to stealing your whole identity.</p>

		<p>Working in McDonalds for minimum wage plus 50 cents is about 10 times better than working in Mexico for average wages.That is why so many Mexicans work there, and why food there is so affordable, and one of the reasons why the obesity rate has reached 30% in the United States.</p>

		<p>No matter where &#8220;hispanics&#8221; work they sell fake/stolen I.D.&rsquo;s&hellip;. It was hispanic DMV employees who sold them driver&rsquo;s licenses, now fast food joints?  Boycott McDonalds! All they do is pander to blacks/hispanics and hire them anyway. I stopped going there 2 decades ago. It was getting bad then.</p>

		<p>The government should levy a multi-million dollar fine to get the message across to McDonald&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>The labor marketplace has to be governed by environmental limitations: if they can&rsquo;t find legal employees in the external environment, even by raising wages, then the businesses should fold.  </p>

		<p>One of the worst things the Hispanics bring to America is corruption.  Corruption will ruin a country.  Fight against it any way you can.  </p>
<p>After the Hispanics get through trashing the US they will move on to Canada, I suppose.  Of course by then Canada might already be trashed by the Muslims and Tamil Tigers and Somalis.  </p>

<p>The local cops told us that thieves breaking into homes here in S. California look for birth certificates/ID/SS cards FIRST, after that it&rsquo;s guns, cash, small electronics and jewelry, in that order.</p>

		<p>Many of you will one day be surprised to find your own identity is being used by an illegal.<br>
Five years ago I was pulled over for taking an illegal right on a red light.<br>
The cop told me someone was using my name in South Florida&hellip;someone wanted for several crimes.  There are so many illegal hispanics in South Florida, it is just unbelievble.<br>
First they run me out of my city of birth (Miami).<br>
Then they run me out of my state of birth. Now they are trashing my adopted home state of Colorado, and they got my name, my SSN, my identity.<br>
And immigration is good for us, HOW?</p>

		<p>In the Chicago area, you go to almost any Mc Donalds and the language spoken behind the counter is uniformly Spanish. NO whitey speaking English can possibly hold a job there any more, and the THIS EVEN IN ALL WHITE AREAS!</p>
<p>If these stolen ID are used by criminals and your good name is tarnished, those victims need to sue Mc Donalds big time for having established a climate to led to these ID crimes having been committed.</p>

		<p> Seems to me that major companies are jumping on the illegal labor hiring as fast as they can. We need to boycott anyone that hires illegals and make every effort to hire whites for jobs we need done.</p>

		<p>I just can&rsquo;t have compassion with people who are breaking our laws, getting benefits  &mdash;  over and at the expense  &mdash;  that Americans don&rsquo;t have, and wanting it all in their language.  Oh, that, and the fact they only look out for their own race while we are sued and jailed for doing the same.</p>

<p>I was born in 1943 and have my original Social Security card. It says right on the bottom of the card that it is not to be for ID.<br>
The fear was that it could morph into a government ID. </p>
<p>Well, here we are. The cards haven&rsquo;t said this for years and most people don&rsquo;t have a clue. I once mentioned this to an accountant and he said he didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about. He thought I was crazy.</p>
<p>As we all know, the government is very good at selective enforcement of its own laws.  </p>

		<p>I stopped eating in any restaurants of any kind decades ago because virtually all restaurant help here in S. California is illegal hispanic.</p>
<p>Some of the high end dinner houses still have White servers, but everyone in the kitchen is hispanic.</p>
<p>When friends ask me out to dinner, I just ask them to dinner at my place, they can bring steaks or wine or whatever.  Another place I boycott is 7-11s.</p>
<p>Every owner is a non White foreigner.  They got the money to buy the place from a Small Business Administration loan, loans which are denied to American White men.-</p>
<p>Boycott, boycott, boycott</p>

		<p>I wish the FBI would start investigating the numerous RNs, LVNs, physical therapists, pharmacist foreigners who are working with false credentials.</p>
<p>The administrators who hire them are completely aware that the credentials are fraudulent.  The administrators are also corrupt filipino, asian and hispanic foreigners who hire their relatives and friends and often provide them with false credentials.</p>
