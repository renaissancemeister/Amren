			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Social Contract, April 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As millions of Americans brace themselves to pay taxes on April 18th [instead of April 15th this year, owing to a local D.C. holiday] millions of illegal aliens get ready to celebrate a cash windfall of up to $5,750 from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), according to US Inc.</p>
<p>Why is this? Ed Rubenstein, president of ESR Research and a former director of research at the Hudson Institute, explains in his recently updated report entitled <cite>Defrauding the American Taxpayer  &mdash;  The Earned Income Tax Credit and Illegal Immigration,</cite> that illegal aliens are among the chief beneficiaries of the $62.5 billion income transfer scheme known as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).</p>
<p>In the report, Rubenstein reveals that the IRS knowingly allows illegal aliens to defraud taxpayers by getting cash EITC payments of up to $5,750 for a family of five. The IRS also refuses to implement recommendations from its own Inspector General&rsquo;s office that could stop massive EITC fraud that costs taxpayers as much as $13 billion a year.</p>
<p>Rubenstein also shows how Congress has changed a federal kick-back program intended to supplement the earnings of low income workers, into one that subsidizes parenthood and disproportionately benefits immigrant families as opposed to those of native workers.</p>
<p>Copies of this explosive seven-part report, <cite>Defrauding the American Taxpayer-The Earned Income Tax Credit and Illegal Immigration,</cite> are available at our website: www.thesocialcontract.com. <cite>The Social Contract</cite> is a quarterly journal published by US Inc., a Michigan non-profit organization.<br>

<p>I knew this a long time ago (the agency I worked for) and it made me so angry and I tried to tell people about it, but they were so apathetic! They just say, &#8220;Well what can we do about it since the government gives it all away&#8221;&hellip;No wonder this country is so far gone! We reward minorities and illegals AND legals at every turn.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know which infuriates me more: paying high taxes to support a large White-hating welfare population in California and the USGs illegal, expanding overseas wars or the EITC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a draw.</p>
<p>Every day this time of year I have many students, some without papers, come into my room to tell me of the windfall they or they family have received from EITC   &mdash;    $2,500, $5,000, $4,500. </p>
<p>Many of these families have no working adult in their midst and live entirely off of government services.</p>
<p>This as we teachers are being vilified nationally and our pay cut (my district in California has opened with 12 furlough days, larger class sizes and a percent of our salary for next year).</p>

<p>It used to be that to qualify for EITC, you had to:</p>
<p>(1)  Be at least 18 years old, </p>
<p>(2)  File as &#8220;Head of Household&#8221; only, i.e. you had to be a single parent,</p>
<p>(3)  Have one or more dependents all under the age of 19,</p>
<p>(4)  Be working earning a salary, wages, and/or tips,</p>
<p>(5)  Earn an amount of money that was modest, but not too high   &mdash;   The maximum EITC amounts would come to those whose jobs, prorated to hourly wages, were somewhere between a bit more than and almost twice the minimum wage</p>
<p>(6)  Be a citizen or legal alien,</p>
<p>(7)  You yourself as the adult collector of EITC could not be classified as a dependent on someone else&rsquo;s individual tax return</p>
<p>Plus there were more qualifying factors.  I&rsquo;m just reciting the ones I remember.</p>
<p>Bon, if you&rsquo;re right, then you&rsquo;re saying that illegal aliens under 18 who aren&rsquo;t working but with children are getting EITC.  Either the EITC rules have changed since I last remember (which is likely), or the IRS is ignoring all the EITC rules save having children, and that is very possible, because this article does state that the IRS doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about illegal aliens illegally getting EITC.  If they don&rsquo;t care about that rule, they probably don&rsquo;t care about the others.  I&rsquo;m waiting for the first news of a person without a dependent child getting EITC.</p>

		<p>I just took out a $5,000 loan to pay the taxes I owe for last year off a salary of just $31,000. Just enough to subsidize one of these. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving serious thought to going back to South Korea where Americans work tax free. After just one year there I had over $6,000 in savings. That was after an expensive $4,000 vacation. After 4 years in the U.S., I&rsquo;m $7,500 in the hole. I&rsquo;m through paying taxes to support non-whites at the expense of my quality of life. </p>

		<p>Ever wondered why there are TWO separate addresses to which you send you taxes.  One if you actually pay taxes and one if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s because the first one is gone over with a fine tooth comb, an army of forensic accountants and a goodly number of law enforcement.</p>
<p>The other address is simply rubber stamped and everything included assumed to be true.  Anything out of the ordinary is just ignored (most of these filers are actual retards, after all).</p>
<p>The net result is no security whatsoever should someone &#8220;file taxes&#8221; under 3 dozen assumed names and get the credit each time.</p>
<p>It was particularly obnoxious when they caught a number of prison inmates doing this.</p>
<p>Just one more example of the duel tiered justice system we live under.  Non-white&hellip;.rape, rob, murder and steal all you want.  We create a special world for you where there are almost never any reas consequences.</p>
<p>White?  Forget to sign your name on a tax document?  Pay most of your wealth and/or end up in hell.</p>

		<p>Oh it is even worse than this! There are a couple of other scams going on. One is that, according to this:<br>
<a href="https://preview.tinyurl.com/3ky3bft" rel="nofollow">https://preview.tinyurl.com/3ky3bft</a><br>
a single mom making $14,000 has more disposable income than some single mom making $60,000!  And, to make it worse, those numbers  do not include what is called (I am not making this up!) &#8220;Crazy Money&#8221;. This is at least $600 for each child in a family (and some of these families are substantial) who has a &#8220;disability&#8221;- like Educationally Handicapped or the like. So some of these families are getting some big dollars as SSI!</p>

		<p>@2 Anon,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
People should be OUTRAGED, but they won&rsquo;t be. Especially the White apathetic taxpayers.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s quite understandable.  Whites don&rsquo;t use violence because that&rsquo;s dangerous and destructive to both sides in an argument.  We evolved as a culture in an environment so harsh that it was far simpler to deny support and welfare as shunning.</p>
<p>If our government betrays us, it is shunned.</p>
<p>If alien ethnies whom we don&rsquo;t want to be associated with are given unfair leverage over us, we are likely -already- shunning them.</p>
<p>Simple evolutionary psychology from a time when Europe was covered with ice up to a mile thick and you played the social altruism game or you were in a world of hurt.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
I knew this a long time ago (the agency I worked for) and it made me so angry and I tried to tell people about it, but they were so apathetic! They just say, &ldquo;Well what can we do about it since the government gives it all away&rdquo;&hellip;No wonder this country is so far gone! We reward minorities and illegals AND legals at every turn.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is why we need to separate, again, from those in our society whose traitorous /sickness/ of &#8216;accomodation&rsquo; personality (also useful if it brings in outside gene traits between scattered tribes but ultimately dangerous now) puts them in a position of power where their only real skill is giving stuff away.</p>
<p>I bet, when most white people think &#8216;13 billion dollars!&rsquo; they think in terms of the _real wealth_ as permanency that that would buy.</p>
<p>Superior schooling for their kids away from the squallor of public education.</p>
<p>Paid off mortgages so that all earned moneys could be paid into savings for retirement and kids could have a real inheritance.</p>
<p>A chance to switch to renewable energies so that &#8216;the other bill&rsquo; that includes your electric utilities is at least a little smaller.</p>
<p>You give white people back the _franchised ownership_ in their society as the levels of money needed to improve it from the inside and you will see us turn back to what we have shunned.</p>
<p>And you will see everything from our technology levels to our crime and joblessness rates improve as well.</p>
<p>In any case, it is not apathy.  It is a rage so deep that we prefer disassociation to accomodation.</p>
<p>Why deal with a thief?</p>

<p>Sorry, I disagree. So Whites should just pander and give in, is what you are saying? So OUR violence will be dangerous and destructive to both sides?  Now it is all one-sided (their side) and just where has that gotten us?  Seems you are saying to follow the herd over the cliff as long as you are &#8220;peaceful&#8221; and non-confrontational, you will be okay? What about self defense as a race? Is that okay?  Face reality!</p>
<p>The world is a violent place (always has been for our people)and the race that does not protect itself from invasion (through violence, war, etc) is doomed to extinction. Look at our ancestors of yore!  We would never have been born if not for their warrior/racial attitudes.</p>

		<p>I agree, a lot of the EITC and &#8220;crazy checks&#8221; are just scams to get more taxpayer money.  We&rsquo;ll never know the extent of the SSI scams.  In some &#8220;communities&#8221; it&rsquo;s a way of life for people to try to get their kids diagnosed with some kind of mental disability to get a check.  It&rsquo;s a good living for them.  Since when is not bringing up your children to behave like humans a disability.  I know of someone who has tried to get crazy checks for all three of her illegitimate children.  I have heard that in the Bronx, NY it is easy to get SSI checks for mental disabilities and drug/alcohol addiction.  I have a feeling that if you&rsquo;ve got your own people in charge of your case you&rsquo;ve got a leg up. </p>
