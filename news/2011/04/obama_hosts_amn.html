		<p>He has completely given up on the white vote and is going full force to ensure the brown vote! Green cards for Democratic votes. Our politicians are selling out our future for political power today. Do they have any idea what will happen to American when they (Mexicans) become the majority in the US? One only has to look at the conditions in Mexico to see the furture of America. I weep for my great nation, lock and load friends, troubling times ahead.</p>

		<p>Not only amnesty for illegal Mexicans and other assorted third worlders, but debt amnesty for failed African &#8220;American&#8221; historically black college in Atlanta, a mecca of third world afrovoodooism.  Obama allows them to skip on millions of taxpayer dollars in effort to regain their accredidation.  </p>
<p>Debt amnesty for blacks- defeating White privilege through more fee stuff for &#8220;his people&#8221;:</p>

		<p>Three local candidates for the obama-holder &#8220;their people&#8221; afrovoodoo amnesty through the criminal justice system- </p>
<p> https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/marta-arrests-three-in-924351.html</p>
<p>if convicted (doubtful) they will be given time served and unsupervised community service.  Amnesty them back onto the streets where they can keep up the struggle against your White privilege. Long before then, this story will completely disappear from the news.  Atlanta is well known for never following up arrests during regular and horrendous black crime spree. </p>
<p>Gang of TWENTY afros beat two our our fellow Whiteys on MARTA train, and Atlanta cops only make THREE arrests! When Judge Marvin Arrington kicked the Whiteys out of his courtroom a few years ago and suffered no consequence, the message went out that any pursuit of afrovoodoo perps should be only in token fashion.</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia- come to the city that calls itself too busy to hate while is masters its fostering a hostile and dangerously anti-Whitey environment.  </p>
<p>Any Whiteys who raise their Whitey children in afrodom Atlanta should be charged with child abuse.<br>

		<p>The man&rsquo;s positions on everything were determined by the bankrollers for his campaign.</p>
<p>We can ONLY get past this by having candidate systems which fix a federal budget and debate cycle for everyone and make it absolutely illegal for PACSIGs to get their foot in the door.</p>
<p>Since that will _never happen_ in this nation, it more or less comes down to Separation or Annihilation.</p>
<p>And in this, Mestizos flooding certain areas may make sense.  Because the first time one of them decides to declare &#8216;A Socialist Republic Of New North Mexico!!&rsquo; (probably after they are put on a very short budgetary leash post-default in places like California) there will be an opportunity for us to secede as well.</p>
<p>The Globalists want America to fragment.  To destroy it&rsquo;s all-in-one power base as a world leader so that they can step in.  And frankly, it&rsquo;s too late to stop that.  Which means that we can choose how we lose 1/2-2/3rds of our country.</p>
<p>Or we can be forced to live in a mixed race nanny state run by corporate socialists from outside our borders.</p>
<p>The option to &#8216;save America&rsquo; (Save The Whales!) is done.</p>
<p>And this man and his skewed approach to leadership as an act of deliberate national sabotage should prove this.  Because is almost certainly going to ram Appeasement Amnesty through.  It is just about his only hope for getting reelected now.</p>

		<p>I read somewhere that when the 14th Amendment was passed Southern legislatures were barred by armed guards from entering the Capitol building, which technically was unconstitutional since not all reps could vote.  This is not different.</p>
<p>Oh, and if someone could clarify any wrongs in what I wrote or point towards some articles about it I would appreciate it.</p>
