			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauri B. Regan, American Thinker, April 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the average human being, it was not possible to watch the video of two black women beating the life out of a defenseless white woman at a McDonald&rsquo;s in Baltimore and not feel complete and total revulsion. Adding to the horror was the knowledge that the black employees  &mdash;  one who only half-heartedly attempted to intervene, one who was filming the barbarism, and perhaps others not seen on the video  &mdash;  did absolutely nothing to save the white woman from her assailants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But more importantly, I then thought about the fact that we have a black president who so far has remained silent about the crime. Barack Obama was vociferously outspoken when his black buddy Louis Gates was properly and justifiably arrested by white officers in Boston two years ago. However, when a white woman is brutally beaten to a pulp by two black women less than an hour from the White House, our POTUS has nothing to say on the subject.</p>
<p>And the reason that this is so offensive is two-fold: (i) Barack Hussein Obama was supposed to be our post-racial president bridging the racial divide and healing the country&rsquo;s wounds; and (ii) Michelle Obama has spent the better part of the past two and a half years as first lady dictating to America&rsquo;s youth what they should and should not be eating rather than helping them learn how they should and should not be acting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead of telling people what they should order if they enter a McDonald&rsquo;s, the first lady should be teaching people how to act when they enter a McDonald&rsquo;s or any other public place. This is not a racist suggestion  &mdash;  the suggestion is no different from Barack Obama telling young children that they can all fulfill their dreams since, as a minority, he was able to ascend to the highest office in the land.</p>
<p>Perhaps Michelle Obama has not watched the video clip of two black women beating the white woman to a pulp. If she has not, she should. And perhaps it will move her to stop talking about food and start talking about behavior, because with her fancy vacations, personal chef, elaborate parties, and other sundry benefits of the job comes responsibility.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In his famous &#8220;race speech&#8221; Obama stated:<blockquote>[R]ace is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care, or education, or the need to find good jobs for every American.</p>
<p>What we have already achieved gives us hope  &mdash;  the audacity to hope  &mdash;  for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.<br>
</blockquote>Well it is tomorrow and our absentee president is, well, absent. Healing the country&rsquo;s wounds is tough business. One cannot have the audacity to hope but then remain silent in the face of atrocities like that which occurred at a McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant this week.</p>
<p>Obama has not hesitated to interject himself into a multitude of domestic issues including the Louis Gates arrest (in which he opined, &#8220;what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there&rsquo;s a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately&#8221;), the Ground Zero Mosque controversy (in which he discussed &#8220;[o]ur capacity to show not merely tolerance, but respect to those who are different from us&#8221;), and the Wisconsin budget protests (in which he stated that Governor Walker&rsquo;s legislation was &#8220;an assault on unions&#8221;).</p>
<p>In Obama&rsquo;s world, African-Americans, Muslims, and unions are victims who deserve presidential support. There will be no prosecuting New Black Panthers who terrorize white voters, there will be a worldwide reach out to Islamic terrorists, and union thugs will be given carte blanche to bully members and non-members alike. But white transgender women are on their own.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. President, it is time to stop talking. Perhaps instead of going to George Washington University to give a campaign speech justifying your abysmal economic policies, you should visit inner city schools and teach kids respect for human life and common decency. Take on the responsibilities of office which include immediately denouncing this act of violence and begin to address the cause full steam ahead. Move past your own resentments and anger about the travails of poor black Americans since the beginning of time and take proactive steps to help them learn to value life  &mdash;  not government handouts and entitlements and certainly not violence.</p>
<p>{snip} But I am strongly advocating that they use their remaining time in office (God willing, only 19 more months) to the betterment of society. And what society needs desperately is a toning down of the anger, racism, and class warfare that the Obamas are fomenting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>We couldn&rsquo;t ask for better race reality news that what we&rsquo;ve been getting during the Obama regime.  How many thousands have fled to our side thanks to him?</p>
<p>Obvious prediction: we are headed for a Day of Racial Reckoning sometime before Nov. 2012, and it will be so revealing in its ugliness and horror, that the division between healthy Whites and our diseased Whites-in-name-only cousins will become unbridgeable and permanent. </p>
<p>There WILL BE a flash point event, a tipping point inflection, a singularity, a criticality, and nothing will ever be the same again in America after that. It will be a videotape of anti-White violence that makes the Baltimore Beatdown nothing but a playful romp.</p>
<p>Race Reality will become the new patriotism and national duty. We will hear respected politicians claim that America was perhaps a bit too hasty with Integration and Civil Rights, and that instead, we should have developed a negotiated opportunity for blacks to earn their full citizenship status. </p>
<p>The Kerner Report will be held up as a subversive and dangerous hate screed against Whites.  Everyone will agree that America was purposefully transformed into a hostile and dangerously anti-White environment.   Whites will hold mass boycotts of all institutions that foster diversity and help minorities.</p>
<p>In other words, justified prejudice, bias, racism and racialism will become so mainstreamed, that to argue against them will be outdated and suspect.  </p>
<p>We suspect that the nation-recovering, flash point video will involve vile black thugs and innocent White children.</p>
<p>Too bad Glenn Beck will be off the air, because he, and only he, would have shown it.  Tonight, he proved that his German genes can&rsquo;t be held back - he&rsquo;s more one of us than we yet admit.</p>
<p>Tonight, he replayed Holder&rsquo;s toxic &#8220;we are a nation of cowards,&#8221; then showed videos of blacks acting like wild, frenzied people in Burger King and McDonald&rsquo;s, especially the Baltimore Beatdown.  Then he said, regarding our willingness to complain about these telling signs, &#8220;People are becoming more and more courageous, EVEN when they are called a racist!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, has he been reading Racism Schmacism?</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/pG7Bs" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/pG7Bs</a></p>
<p>The anti-white liberal elite will go nuts over that comment.  Beck is successfully making progress at desensitizing us to the racism charge. SPLC-ADL-NAACP won&rsquo;t let that stand, so look for increasingly shrill anti-racist rhetoric, as well as a few more martyred scapegoats, all in rapid succession.</p>
<p>The Color of Change just cost Beck tens of millions of dollars by getting him kicked off his Fox slot, so look for him to take a few parting swipes the afro regime, all to our aid and comfort.</p>
<p>He also said, &#8220;We once had heroes. The question is, will America have them in the future?&#8221;  Well, yes, we will, but they are the ones whom you can&rsquo;t be seen with in public right now.</p>
<p>Then he showed the White girl having her post-beatdown seizure, and he said, &#8220;Will no one step in? Are we afraid? WE&rsquo;RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE AS A NATION IF WE DON&rsquo;T STOP THIS BEHAVIOR?&#8221;</p>
<p>Welcome to the AmRen Community, Mr. Beck.  We&rsquo;ve known that for a long time, and no, an intact nation will not survive, because after Brown v. Board, Little Rock, and the &#8220;ongoing&#8221; Civil Rights &#8220;struggle,&#8221; everyone has been indeed afraid to step in, for fear of being called a racist.  That fear is diminishing, thanks to the daily mounting evidence of the iron laws of nature.  We are Race Realists, therefore, we accept that the blacks define themselves by how they act, and nothing about them gives us any hope that their behavior will stop.  We&rsquo;ve never held out that delusive hope. They won&rsquo;t be happy until they are free to live as nature intended for them to live, and that is when they are fully emancipated from White Civilization, otherwise called our &#8220;nation&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Im surprised that he didnt say something once it became obvious that the victim was a transsexual- since a &#8220;sexual minority&#8221; trumps White race in the liberal hierarchy of victimhood. </p>

		<p> Excellent column, Ms. Regan! You point up exactly what is rotten at the heart of Obama&rsquo;s pious pronouncements on race: He applies them only one way. If a lawful arrest of Henry Louis Gates merited comment at a presidential press conference including the statement that the police acted &#8220;stupidly,&#8221; then why does not the beating of this young woman, in all likelihood for reasons of race, merit at least a written statement issued by the press office?</p>
<p> Does anyone really think that, if it had been two young White women who beat, kicked and stomped a young black women, Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have rushed over to Baltimore with bells on, preaching to the already converted about &#8220;hate&#8221; and the need to have a &#8220;dialogue on race&#8221;?</p>

		<p>A fair piece. Obama&rsquo;s ignoring of this incident is a sin of omission, but his administration is guilty of plenty of sins of commission against whites as well, including Attorney General Eric Holder&rsquo;s slur against whites and the refusal to prosecute the Black Panther party for a clear act of voter intimidation. If the races had been reversed and the prez were white, the MSM would be documenting and railing about his racism on a daily basis. Since he happens to be black, however, total silence.</p>

		<p>The black (I cannot say it) who beat the white transgender whatever did so because they never were whupped in a fight, that is because they ALWAYS chose their victims very carefully, they always started a fight with someone that that KNEW that they could defeat easily. Bullies NEVER attempt to fight someone that they believe has a chance to defeat them.</p>

<p>The predatory animal in the wild the same way. These crime experts have determined a long time ago that you can tell a lot about a criminal by just observing the types of persons that they victimize. Mostly the old, feeble, weak, young, sick, etc. Same as a predator in the wild. WILL NOT attack an adversary that can fight back even if only slightly so.</p>

		<p>I believe the black leadership is silent about black on white violence, because they want it to occur.  They see black assaaults, crime and misbehavior, as a kind of leverage <br>
to apply pressure to the white establishment to gain more positions and power for blacks in general.</p>
<p>You know, like, &#8220;if you don&rsquo;t give us what we want we&rsquo;re going to encourage more of the same and we might even cause a major riot or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s their strategy, it&rsquo;s working very well for them, because the white weenie elites are ready to do almost anything to prevent any kind of mass disobeience that will cause them to lose money or power, so they contnue to placate blacks any way necessary to keep the peace.</p>
<p>Whites will not be treated any better than they are by these miscreants until they fear that whites will cause serious upheaval themselves.  Modern day whites are content to sit and wait, so long as they still have bit of money and a measure of comfort, so they can be expected to shut up and sit down whenever they&rsquo;re beaten by blacks and ignored by the police.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take a lot to change that.  Something on the order of mass civil upheaval by non-whites against whites in order to get whites up off the couch and fighting mad.<br>

		<p>I watched this video in its entirety and the part near the end, where the white individual is on the floor having convulsions, is absolutely horrifying! It reminded me of the Rodney King beating video which was played ad naseum by the left-wing media. Except this clip is virtually absent from the airwaves, not supplemented with the race-baiting commentary of the know-it-all talking heads on the tube the way the King video was. </p>

		<p>Sorry, but when the author keeps referring to the victim as a &#8216;woman&rsquo; repeatedly even when it has now been established that it was a man, he lost credibility. The piece is dated April 26, so it was not in the immediate aftermath of the incident.</p>
<p>Then there is a difference between the two scenarios. The incident of the professor getting arrested was about the code of conduct of law enforcement with regards to blacks. The second was about the behavior of two immature teenage girls 14 and 17 who were probably threatened by a man entering their restroom and overreacted.</p>
<p>If the author wanted to point out the double standards, he could have certainly picked better examples than the McDonalds incident. I am sure there is no dearth of them.</p>

		<p>I am very saddened when I saw this video- it is just a daily occurance here in South Africa.  In `The Mail and Guardian` it is reported today that a policeman shot a woman 45 y old who crashed her car in a police vehicle outside a police station (we know is is white because she has an Afrikaans name and surname-the only way in SA to determine the race of the victim when whites are concerned-white on black violence (very scarce!) the newspapers will bellow out White man attack black victim&hellip;)  when a car guard asked the policeman why he did it-he got no answer-and for phoning the ambulance he said she is dying in any case! WEIRD!!! Cannot help to wonder if this is the way the song-`shoot the boer` is taking an official turn!</p>
<p>I always say -there are fantastic and wonderful black people in SA-but in the minority. <br>

		<p>The problem is not that the president did not talk about this crime.  The problem is that he DID talk about the first one.  Neither is any of his business.  He is the president of the United States.  He is not the police chief of Baltimore or Cambridge.</p>
<p>You are right that he is a hypocrite, and a very shallow-thinking hypocrite at that.  But the hypocrisy is not his alone.  I may be wrong, but I am almost sure that he offered his ignorant opinion about the Gates incident when a reporter posed a question in a news conference.  Has he been asked about the McDonald&rsquo;s attack?  I don&rsquo;t think he has, and I don&rsquo;t expect that he will.  This is just barely news, dogs bite man.  This would hardly be known outside Baltimore if the vic were not a transexual.</p>

		<p>Get real. </p>
<p>You know if Obama began commenting on black violence against whites it would be a 24/7/365 thing non-stop because the vicious terrorism against whites in this nation is covered up locally in every city and state in America. </p>
<p>Obama covers up his own racism as well as he can. </p>
<p>Trump is called a racist? </p>
<p>When Obama is turned out of office in 2012 can you imagine the violence that will ensue against whites even much worse than now? </p>
<p>It would be a good idea if websites like AMREN began to forewarn whites to be vigilant and arm themselves in advance because you know without a doubt its coming. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Welcome to the AmRen Community, Mr. Beck&#8221;</p>
<p>Very nice article/letter. I hope Beck even reads it. However, you&rsquo;re welcoming letter to &#8216;Mr. Beck&rsquo; and all those others on the fence, ends up being an advertisement Not to join &#8216;race realism&rsquo;. Is there a website or a cause that&rsquo;s against whites being victims of real and both institutional racism that&rsquo;s not So racist? Or even simply providing the white-half of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. Sort of the National Association/White United Students contribution to diversity. This is what real anti racists and race realists should be doing, helping put an end to anti-white hate and the sort-of one sided, blinder wearing public perception on these issues that we have, something that seems arguably (and wrongly) forced upon us. We&rsquo;ve had over 600,000 Americans die of AIDs, not once, not ever, have we learned the race of those who&rsquo;ve died. And I might add, we&rsquo;ve wilfully been told a misleading tale all this time, as far as they could possibly stretch the truth. Let&rsquo;s just say it, lie. The people who study race, as a profession (and those who do it cause it&rsquo;s the right-thing-to-do), somehow aren&rsquo;t able to study race.  </p>
<p>Racial activism is &#8216;racism&rsquo; and it takes a realist, I suppose, to acknowledge it. I&rsquo;m very surprise, however, a race realist, one even concerned with the white race, doesn&rsquo;t make the obvious point that it&rsquo;s almost 100 percent people of color and going-along whites who participate in racial activism &#8216;racism&rsquo;, and instead paints himself as the racist. </p>
<p>I suppose you can&rsquo;t blame people of color, it&rsquo;s racism itself and the racist system that&rsquo;s taught them. Was my statement intended as joke? You decide. </p>
<p>My questions really not so rhetorical, but, since there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any alternative, that I know of, AmRen is the only game in town. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here simply because I hate. Been victim of a hate crime, harassed, intimidated, slighted, discriminated against one too many times, I no longer care. Being called a &#8216;racist&rsquo; for associating with AmRen isn&rsquo;t too high a price to pay, for me. What about others? We could certainly use your help?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;For the average human being, it was not possible to watch the video of two black women beating the life out of a defenseless white woman at a McDonald&rsquo;s in Baltimore and not feel complete and total revulsion.&rdquo;  First, these people in Washington are not average human beings, they are the elitists; they feel themselves to be better than us (European Americans/Europeans).  And I doubt they felt the slightest bit of revulsion.<br>
   <br>
What we need to realize, and, most of us do, is that we Whites/Caucasians (European Americans/Europeans) are pretty much on our own.  As the years have come and gone, we have had our country taken from us by stealth by the individuals existing in Washington (beginning with the 1965 Immigration and Nationalization Act and proceeding forward).  Mr. and Mrs. Obama remain silent and mute as would Mr. and Mrs. Bush as would Mr. and Mrs Clinton, etcetera, etcetera, etc.  Most politicians are not going to denounce or &ldquo;touch&rdquo; this act, just as most politicians will not touch any act of aggression where the European American/European is the victim.               <br>

		<p>@#5: I agree with you about the blacks carefully picking their targets; they also usually gang up on the victim. It&rsquo;s rare in these videos to see evenly matched fighting. another characteristic behavior. </p>
<p>@#1: I hope you&rsquo;re right because if the present conditions go on for too long, the Whites will not be able to launch a counter-offensive. And BTW, I discovered Thomas Dixon about four years ago and find his writing to be uplifting and oh so current!! I encourage all Amreners to read Dixon; his books can be found on Amazon resellers.</p>

		<p>If Obama loses the 2012 election, there will be urban riots on a scale last seen in Detroit and Los Angeles back in the 1960s. The type of black on white violence seen in the McDonald&rsquo;s video beating and in many other recent videos, is nothing compared to what we will see shortly after Obama&rsquo;s concession speech. Many blacks believe even the craziest of conspiracy theories.  These folks, believe that AIDS and crack cocaine were created to kill blacks. They believe that certain soft drinks have chemicals to make blacks sterile and that George Bush seeded the clouds to cause hurricane Katrina and then blew up the dikes protecting the black section of New Orleans with explosives. If Obama loses the next election by a close margin, these folks will no doubt believe the election was stolen. Many white liberals, living in major urban areas across the country, will finally learn the true nature multiculturalism. The first element of self-defense is awareness. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The second was about the behavior of two immature teenage girls 14 and 17 who were probably threatened by a man entering their restroom and overreacted.</p>
<p>If the author wanted to point out the double standards, he could have certainly better examples than the McDonalds incident. I am sure there is no dearth of them.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Overreacted? That has to be the understatement of the week!<br>
Immature teenage girls? Blacks never reach maturity even at 50!<br>
The only maturity they reach is sexual; usually at about 8 or 9.</p>

		<p>Blacks and Whites should live apart.  Period.</p>
<p>We should figure out the cost differences in providing a differentiated society where luxury goods and an easy (free!) lifestyle were provided to them vs. the eternal and increasing costs of justifying their presence (AA as make work, dozens of entitlement programs etc.) in our parts of America and from that differential, designate a budget that excludes them, geographically, from our company.</p>
<p>Did we provide a guaranteed lifestyle of 20,000 dollars in guaranteed housing and food and entertainment, just to be rid of them, many would take the offer.  Because, deep down, they know that they cannot do better on their own.</p>
<p>The driving factor being the end of AFCD, S8, SSI and all other forms of social welfare.</p>
<p>Money to be distributed first of every month, to prevent abuse.  And mandatory sterilization after the second child.</p>
<p>It may seem like dhimmitude as blackmail but it is likely to be cheaper and certainly more efficient (for a nation bent on selling out it&rsquo;s last R&D; edge and competing with ever more technically proficient, educationally and genetically superior countries in the 21st century).</p>
<p>The thing of it is, we need to be able to also design a system which keeps the peace and sustains their infrastructure, separately (i.e. without risk of exposure) to ours.</p>
<p>I think this contempt of exclusion might finally break through their hardened shell of &#8216;self esteem&rsquo; and make them realize how little they are liked.  By anyone.</p>

		<p><i>It would be a good idea if websites like AMREN began to forewarn whites to be vigilant and arm themselves in advance because you know without a doubt i&rsquo;ts coming.</i></p>
<p>You yourself must warn everyone you care about.  Spread the Word.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t, who will?</p>
<p>Because I read this last night (when I should have long been in bed asleep)&hellip;.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Obama: We&rsquo;re Working on Gun Control &#8216;Under the Radar&rsquo;</b><br>
 <br>
<i>&#8216;I just want you to know that we are working on it,&rsquo; Barack Obama reportedly told Sarah Brady regarding gun control. &#8220;We have to go through a few processes, but under the radar.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Sarah Brady related how President Obama gave her his personal assurance that he and his administration were working hard on a gun-control agenda. Brady reported that Obama then told them about advancing the agenda &#8216;under the radar.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>I believe this will be FIRST on 0bama&rsquo;s agenda when he&rsquo;s elected to a second term.  Get your guns and ammunition before it&rsquo;s too late. Train everyone you can, especially your women.</p>
<p>Colonel Colt didn&rsquo;t call his revolvers &#8220;equalizers&#8221; for nothing!</p>
<p><i>If Obama loses the 2012 election, there will be urban riots on a scale last seen in Detroit and Los Angeles back in the 1960s.</i></p>
<p><i>Take food away from a lion or tiger or bear or pit bull or rottweiler and see what happens.</i></p>
<p>Yes.  Plan accordingly.</p>
<p><i>I am very saddened when I saw this video- it is just a daily occurance here in South Africa.</i></p>
<p>Take Special Heed to this warning!  It is our fate as well as we Whites become a minority lorded over by non-Whites.  Please don&rsquo;t be ridiculous and tell me otherwise, you have drunk the government&rsquo;s kool-aid in that case and deserve the fate that has already been planned for you.</p>
<p>For the rest of you:  Get busy before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>I agree. It definitely will happen. Let&rsquo;s hope that Whites will not vote for him based on their fear of just that. If Obama were a decent man, in his concession speech he would include a message to the Black community regarding their behavior.</p>
<p> Stock up on ammunition and make every shot count.</p>

		<p>Hate crimes signal intentionality.  And those girls beat that woman for being TRANS, not for being white.  Our society has purposefully elected not to protect trans folk and that is why these girls don&rsquo;t face a hate-crime enhancement in sentencing.</p>
<p>Hate crimes are not just about race.  They can also, depending on where you live, include gender (legally defined as male or female according gentials) or religion or sexual orientation.  RARE is the state that protects &#8220;gender identity.&#8221;  and gender identity is why this poor woman was beaten to the point of seizure.</p>
