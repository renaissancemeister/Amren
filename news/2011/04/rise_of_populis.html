<h1><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,druck-758883,00.html">Rise of Populist Parties Pushes Europe to the Right</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Manfred Ertel, Peter M체ller, Mathieu Von Rohr, Michael Sauga, Speigel, April 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Timo Soini, 48, is standing in front of &#8220;Hesburger,&#8221; a fast food restaurant in the western part of Helsinki. It is shortly before 10 a.m., and he is waiting patiently for the restaurant to finally open its doors. Soini, the chairman of the right-wing populist Perussuomalaiset, or &#8220;True Finns&#8221; party, has been giving interviews for almost three hours. There are more than 250 new text messages on his mobile phone. Now he&rsquo;s hungry.</p>
<p>It is the morning after an election that brought what the papers have called a &#8220;revolution&#8221; to Finland. Almost one in five voters voted for Soini&rsquo;s party on Sunday, April 17, and now it looks like it is about to become part of the new government. A political earthquake is happening in Helsinki, one that could have reverberations throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Until now, the small country in the far northeastern corner of the continent was seen as a model member of the European Union. It was known for its successful export-oriented companies, liberal social policies and the best-performing school students in the Western industrialized world. It is ironic that it is here in Finland  &mdash;  a part of Europe that always seemed eminently European  &mdash;  that a movement is now coming to power that inveighs against immigrants and abortions, considers Brussels to be the &#8220;heart of darkness&#8221; and rejects all financial assistance for what it calls &#8220;wasteful countries,&#8221; like Greece, Ireland and Portugal. &#8220;We were too soft on Europe,&#8221; says Soini, adding that Finland should not be made to &#8220;pay for the mistakes of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>The election result from Europe&rsquo;s far north has alarmed the political establishment in Brussels. If Soini&rsquo;s party becomes part of the new government, there will be more at stake than Helsinki&rsquo;s traditional pro-European stance. The entire program to rescue the euro could be in jeopardy, because it has to be approved unanimously by the entire European Union. That includes both the anticipated aid for Portugal, the additional billions for the euro bailout fund and the planned reform of the fund. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt calls the Finnish election results a &#8220;reason for concern,&#8221; while Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former head of Germany&rsquo;s pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) and former German foreign minister, warns: &#8220;The outcome of the elections is a warning sign.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gaining Ground Across the EU</b></p>
<p>As a wave of skepticism about Europe sweeps across the continent, the political elites in the continent&rsquo;s capitals are reacting precipitously and inconsistently. To neutralize the populist movements and score political points at home, European leaders are seeking conflict with one another, arguing about such issues as accepting North African refugees or participation in the Libya mission. Markus Ferber, a member of the European Parliament for Germany&rsquo;s conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), warns that solidarity among European countries is waning, a situation he calls &#8220;extremely dangerous.&#8221; </p>
<p>The successes of right-wing populists could indeed exacerbate the smoldering euro crisis. Tensions between the wealthy countries in the north, who are contributing most to the bailouts, and the ailing debtor nations in the periphery already threaten to destroy the monetary union. If a European version of the American Tea Party movement develops, it could very well become the kiss of death for the euro.</p>
<p>The risk is substantial, as euroskeptics gain ground across the EU. In Denmark, the xenophobic Danish People&rsquo;s Party has supported a center-right minority government for almost 10 years. In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Mark Rutte is dependent on the goodwill of right-wing populist politician Geert Wilders, who, with his tirades against Islam and the EU, captured 15.5 percent of the vote in the country&rsquo;s last parliamentary election. In Sweden, the nationalist, anti-European Sweden Democrats crossed the 4-percent threshold to gain seats in the parliament, the Riksdag, and in Italy Umberto Bossi&rsquo;s xenophobic Lega Nord, or Northern League, is even part of the government. Although the party is primarily active in the north of Italy, it is the third-strongest party on the national level.</p>
<p>Only in the core European countries of Germany and France has opposition to the EU long been restricted to marginal groups. In both Berlin and Paris, a strong commitment to Europe has traditionally been considered part of the national interest and was something that transcended party lines.</p>
<p><b>Appeal for Ordinary People</b></p>
<p>But that too could change, especially now that the True Finns have demonstrated in Helsinki how to achieve double-digit election results with nationalistic posturing. In Germany, the euroskeptics are trying to take over the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), and in France the nationalist right is eyeing the country&rsquo;s highest office.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen, daughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, is in the process of putting the fear of God into the country&rsquo;s traditional parties. She wants to shed the image of a racist, extreme party established by her father. As a politician, she appeals to middle-class and blue-collar workers, because she is young and wears jeans, and seems less aloof than the traditional elites that dominate politics in France.</p>
<p>Le Pen wants a strong social welfare state and fewer immigrants from Islamic countries, and she is adamantly against the European Union. She argues that France should withdraw from the euro and reintroduce the franc because the euro, as she says, is already on its way out. If Le Pen had her way, Europe would soon have trade barriers again and a &#8220;moderate protectionism&#8221; to secure jobs.</p>
<p>Her party&rsquo;s showing in regional elections last March speaks for itself. The National Front achieved 15 percent in the first round of voting, even though it was not even on the ballot in the entire country. President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s party, the UMP, only managed to capture two percentage points more than the National Front.</p>
<p>According to opinion polls, Le Pen could even beat Sarkozy in next year&rsquo;s presidential election, which would result in a runoff between her and the expected Socialist candidate, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. In addition to being an embarrassment for the French political establishment, it would be a warning sign for the EU, which is becoming more and more unpopular among its citizens.</p>
<p><b>German Movement Against Euro Rescue</b></p>
<p>Enthusiasm for the EU has also declined in Germany. An anti-Brussels movement called &#8220;Liberal Awakening&#8221; has developed within the FDP, once a strong advocate of European unity. Its leader is Frank Sch채ffler, a boyish-looking former insurance agent who is a member of the German parliament. &#8220;We see ourselves as a grassroots movement,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We are infiltrating the FDP from below.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was already criticism of the euro in Germany, mainly from the political right, before the European single currency replaced the deutschmark in citizens&rsquo; pocketbooks. But Sch채ffler wants nothing to do with that line of argument. His criticism of the euro and the government&rsquo;s crisis management stems from classic liberal convictions about the constitutional state and democracy. He wants the German parliament, the Bundestag, to be making decisions about government finances, and he cites the European treaties that forbid an EU member from taking on the debts of other countries.</p>
<p>But the first year of overcoming the euro crisis has produced precisely the opposite outcome, Sch채ffler complains. &#8220;We have pledged two-thirds of the federal government&rsquo;s tax revenues to cover the national debts of other countries  &mdash;  without the Bundestag being required to approve the issuance of loan guarantees and without a firm basis in the European treaties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sch채ffler was long viewed as a maverick that the party leadership could easily dismiss as a troublemaker. But now his support is growing. Traffic to his website has quadrupled recently, and gone are the days of his being marginalized in the Bundestag.</p>
<p><b>FDP Rebels Could Cause Problems for Merkel</b></p>
<p>Like Sch채ffler, fellow FDP member Wolfgang Gerhardt, a former party chairman who supports a unified Europe, has also come to believe that it is &#8220;simply outrageous that the German government&rsquo;s representatives in Brussels make commitments without so much as consulting the members of the German parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sch채ffler plans to make his move at an upcoming FDP convention in the northern city of Rostock. He and 11 other Bundestag members have drafted a motion that contradicts government policy in almost every respect. Sch채ffler and his fellow combatants are demanding that banks and other private-sector lenders be involved in the euro rescue program, and that member states that do not satisfy the monetary union&rsquo;s stability requirements be given the option to withdraw. Sch채ffler also wants the German government to pressure the European Central Bank to stop buying up the bonds of debt-stricken countries in the future. </p>
<p>Sch채ffler&rsquo;s foray could create problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel. If members of her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, join the FDP renegades, the CDU/CSU and the FDP (who together make up Merkel&rsquo;s coalition government) will lack the necessary majority in the Bundestag to approve the new euro crisis fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). One CDU member of parliament, the budget policy expert Klaus-Peter Willsch, has already joined the ranks of the FDP rebels.</p>
<p>Sch채ffler already feels strong enough to demand changes from FDP leaders. &#8220;It isn&rsquo;t enough just to replace the party leadership,&#8221; says Sch채ffler. &#8220;The FDP also has to score points in the cabinet with new appointments. If we want to implement liberal objectives in tax policy or in the euro rescue program, we have to appoint the finance minister.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Helping to Shape Policy</b></p>
<p>Although it is not very likely that anti-euro politicians like Sch채ffler or Le Pen will soon be shaping government policy in their countries, they have already changed the political climate in Europe.</p>
<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy, for example, is reacting to his political competition on the right when he pursues certain populist policies, such as deporting Roma to Romania or having a train carrying Tunisian refugees stopped at the Italian border.</p>
<p>The German chancellor has also proved to be open to views critical of the euro. Partly because of resistance from the FDP, Merkel had the European bailout funds amended several times, and additional corrections are in the works. To curb discontent within the coalition partners&rsquo; respective parliamentary groups, the German government wants to demand more of a say for national parliaments at the upcoming negotiations over the ESM.</p>
<p>From Helsinki to Rome to The Hague, the anti-Brussels parties can make the dubious claim of already helping shape policy on the continent today. Out of fear of right-wing populists, European leaders are behaving like right-wing populists themselves  &mdash;  and driving Europe further and further apart as a result.</p>
<p>Split over Europe </p>
<p>This could also happen in Helsinki, where the three parties that are trying to form a government have different positions when it comes to Europe. While Euro rebel Soini wants to change the conditions of aid for Portugal and the euro rescue fund, the leader of the conservative National Coalition Party, Jyrki Katainen, supports the European agreements. &#8220;The changes cannot be very significant,&#8221; says the designated prime minister. The aid package for Portugal, says Katainen, is in Finland&rsquo;s interest and is &#8220;essential&#8221; for economic stability. &#8220;The Finnish government&rsquo;s position must be to solve problems and not create new ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>What remains unclear, however, is the extent to which Katainen can rely on the Social Democrats, which, as the second-largest party, will also be part of the new government. Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, a Social Democrat, helped make Finland the model European country it is today.</p>
<p>His successor as party chairman, Jutta Urpilainen, has a different agenda, which could still become a serious threat to all of Europe. Urpilainen seems determined to take a leaf out of the right-wing populists&rsquo; book, especially following the recent election result. </p>
<p>When it comes to the conditions for the euro rescue, she says, the Social Democrats are &#8220;more closely aligned with the True Finns than with the conservatives.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Over time I&rsquo;ve developed the opinion that the European Union needs to go, their currencies reinstated and border controls put back in place.  It&rsquo;s really sad too because the euro is poised to take over as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency and the EU already has the largest economy in the world and will obviously topple an ailing US swimming in third world deluge.  It just isn&rsquo;t worth it.  I was astonished to learn that EU leaders not only seek to admit Turkey but also a long term goal to annex the Maghreb and other parts of the Middle East.  They have no intention of keeping the European Union &#8220;European&#8221; or Christian and this is just a few steps from one world government.</p>

		<p>After calling the U.S. racist, Europe decided to get their own minorities and show us how its done.  Good job Europe!  You invited so many you may lose a few countries, as we will lose a few states.</p>
<p>At least you may wake up before all of you are enslaved by a new wave of &#8220;barbary pirates&#8221;.</p>
<p>How do you Europeans feel about third worlders now?  Did you all hold hands and sing &#8220;Its A Small World&#8221; yet?</p>
<p>And for my favorite quote from my favorite philosopher:</p>

		<p>the political shift is long overdue, and there isn&rsquo;t a second to lose. </p>
<p>where are europeans supposed to run to once the continent has been overrun by muslims invaders?</p>
<p>people are waking up to the that we have nowhere to run to, and that means a fight for the SURVIVAL of europe and europeans. </p>
<p>either we reclaim europe, or europe dies, and is replaced by eurabia. </p>
<p>its that simple.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The ONLY strong currencies?  Not quite!  You could mention also the Swiss franc and the Swedish crown &hellip; two  healthy and very strong currencies that have kept aloof from all of this morass. Sweden and Switzerland wisely chose not to succumb to the Euro. </p>
<p>Otherwise, in the Euro-zone, people privately tell me  that &#8220;since we got  the Euro, everything seems to cost a little more.&#8221;  The Swiss and Swedes do not have that problem, as their currencies rise ever higher and stronger, against the falling dollar (and now the Euro).</p>
<p>But should it be any surprise that the US dollar and British pound are continually  sagging - and now the Euro too - when Britain, France, and the USA presume  to be the world&rsquo;s self-appointed gendarmes, policing the turbulent Third World, now getting involved in the quicksand  politics of Libya? Look at our enormous burden of debt!  Switzerland and Sweden do not do this, nor does China. They keep their money at home,  mind their business, and grow ever richer.</p>
<p>(PS: So now you&rsquo;re an expert on international economics too?)</p>

		<p>&#8220;How do you Europeans feel about third worlders now? Did you all hold hands and sing &ldquo;Its A Small World&rdquo; yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not really, I feel sick, the world is going to hell in a hand basket, and I don&rsquo;t see any serious change on the horizon, even though nationalist parties are growing. I believe freedom is the only thing that can save us, only under capitalism is true separation possible, and wealth generation optimal, the nationalists have got it wrong I think, the nation states are done for, but like a decapitated chicken they will run around chaotically for a little while before dying.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask for this, years ago it seemed like only a handful of us noticed any problems with immigration and duly pointed them out, and were subsequently branded as evil racists, a label that sticks to this day, more than a decade after high school, people still remember that I was that &#8220;Nazi guy&#8221;. But boy are people waking up now, not knowing what to do, and confused as hell over what to vote. I&rsquo;ve had my whole life to think and plan ahead, knowing as I did when I was a teenager that the immigration problem would only get bigger and would never go away. So I&rsquo;m fine, but there are thousands of people trapped in low paying jobs and public housing, and with a growing hostile muslim population this pressure cooker can get very dangerous in a very short time, all it takes is a spark. I&rsquo;m anticipating plenty of sparks this summer, and riots accompanied by the usual car torching. We already have a &#8220;rape epidemic&#8221;, and muggings are on the rise as well. Yup, we&rsquo;ve really painted ourselves into a corner, just wait for the news to come out this summer from France, Sweden, England and all the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;either we reclaim europe, or europe dies, and is replaced by eurabia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very true, but who are &#8220;we&#8221;. Nobody I know wants to fight, the people aren&rsquo;t even armed. We&rsquo;re inundated with muslim thugs, who are armed, and our &#8220;leaders&#8221; tell us to embrace them. Yeah, I think Eurabia is Europe&rsquo;s future, there is no way to avoid it. Read Mark Steyn&rsquo;s book, &#8220;America Alone&#8221;. In it, he documents how Europe is lost, and the only way out is by on of these choices.</p>
<p>1. Join Islam<br>
2. Destroy Islam<br>
3. Reform Islam</p>
<p>Nobody takes the first point seriously, but people in Europe are actually converting to Islam. I can&rsquo;t believe it as I write this, but I have actually met a fairly normal looking white guy, late twenties, who talked warmly about Islam and his experience converting to it. He was bonding with the Pakistanis and the Afghans, and talking about his trip to Mecca, scolding other white &#8220;infidels&#8221; for not knowing about &#8220;The Hag&#8221; (the main muslim pilgrimage). The nationalists are a brave but losing bunch, this problem cannot be solved except for a reformation of Islam, or deportation of all muslims, which will probably lead to slaughter and a full scale war, not gonna happen.</p>
<p>I think the best solution is to:</p>
<p>1. Adopt capitalism, make sure people are FREE and SAFE, then you get the coveted freedom of association and nobody has the right to tax anybody for anything, except what taxpayers voluntary agrees to. This comes with an &#8220;opt-out&#8221; option, all taxes should ultimately be voluntary.</p>
<p>2. Kill the regimes in Saudi-Arabia and Iran, eradicate Islams ideological base, both the Sunni and Shia, and show the world that we are the stronger culture, and our values are better than theirs. If we do that, then we have a fighting chance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think these things will happen. On the contrary, sadly, we&rsquo;ll probably be treated to another era of European fascism.</p>

		<p>Ironically, a United Europe would have had great leveraging advantages in terms of high tech and unified _anti-immigrant_ resistance.  Look at the Middle East and Maghreb (North Africa, east of Egypt).  The all DWARF Europe.  As do their populations.</p>
<p>If we go global in this race to idiocracy, it will take continental _nation states_ to stand against the rising tide of &#8220;But we want more room!&#8221; third world wonders in Africa, the ME/SWA and China.</p>
<p>Because whites have -finally- realized that total lack of population control is only one of a host of uncivilized behaviors that these &#8216;cultures&rsquo; will bring with them.</p>
<p>What we have yet to get across is that _aesthetically and genetically_ we are also &#8216;not interested&rsquo; in cohabitation and thus the economic consequences of inter/multi culturalism is that of cutting up the wealth pie into such small slices that there will be no reapportionment.  It will be gone, forever.</p>
<p>This should worry European elites no end because from the bottom comes the electoral vox populi to change the top.  At least &#8216;so democracy tells us&rsquo; (Turkey will have more seats on the EU council than any other EU state if brought into the union in 2025 etc.).</p>
<p>Racial awareness (and technological firepower) protects minorities who conserve their lands as their peoples and their popular votes.</p>

<p>Your post sounds like the typical neocon garbage that&rsquo;s peddled in the US, Europe is doomed and America will be left standing alone.  We have a minority population almost close to 40 percent and comparing it with Europe, theirs is only a fraction of that.  We will collapse long before Europe does. We&rsquo;re in the process right now of exiting history unless something drastic is done.  Dealing with muslims, we don&rsquo;t need to be bombing their countries, we just need to keep them out of ours.  It&rsquo;s that simple and yet islamic immigration continues at pace.  </p>

<p>They will still be stuck with millions of unassimiable nonwhite aliens who are breeding faster than the native population and living in the heart of Europe. Of course, the corporate shills will utilize this cheap labor to drive down wages and destroy the European middle class.  Your wrong, the nationalists have got it right.  </p>
<p>2. Kill the regimes in Saudi-Arabia and Iran, eradicate Islams ideological base, both the Sunni and Shia, and show the world that we are the stronger culture, and our values are better than theirs. If we do that, then we have a fighting chance.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t 2001 and the neocons are pass챕.  There is one undeniable truth about immigration that people should be able to see through the rhetoric.  It&rsquo;s being staged by European governments not the Islamic world.  They are coming in at the invitation of European leaders otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be there.  The only regime killing that needs to be done is in Paris, London and Brussels, not Riyadh or Tehran.</p>

		<p>13 Anonymous is right.  Immigration and white perfidy therein is 99% of the cause of radical Islamic terrorism in the Western world.  Not long after 9/11, we caught up with KSM and sent him to Gitmo.  He admitted, among other things, that he and AQ/Taliban wanted to commit acts of terrorism at the 2002 World Cup of Soccer in Japan (South Korea co-hosted it, but they were only interested in committing terrorism in Japan), but quickly backed off because, as the media quoted KSM as saying, &#8220;we couldn&rsquo;t get a ground network going in Japan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just why couldn&rsquo;t they?  Answer #1:  Japanese immigration policies.  Answer #2:  To the extent that the Japanese believe in &#8220;civil rights,&#8221; it is for the Japanese only   &mdash;   Nowhere in Japan will you find groups like the ADL and the SPLC lobbying against their own people for the sake of others.  Nobody in Japan is worried about &#8220;Islamophobia.&#8221;</p>
<p>See how easy that was?</p>
<p>As for the other 1% of the problem, problematic regimes and potentates need not be invaded or &#8220;reconstructed&#8221;   &mdash;   They can easily be contained and boxed in with proper force.  As far as nuclear proliferation, I contend that while the Ahmadinejads of the world are nuts, they&rsquo;re not so beyond reason that they don&rsquo;t grok mutually assured destruction.</p>

<p>I can see how you thought I was regurgitating old neocon talking points, but I&rsquo;m definitely NOT a neocon. I&rsquo;m a defender of capitalism, and an advocate of small government. I believe that ideologies come from some ideological beacon, and when this fails, whole cultures fail, like America is failing right now, and all the West is in decline. When I say &#8220;kill the regimes&#8221;, I mean exactly that, NOT nation building. We need to take out the beacons for radical Islam, Iran and Saudi-Arabia. I think we need to show the muslim world that such an ideology will lead to nothing but ruin, only then can we start hoping for change, right now they think they&rsquo;re &#8220;winning&#8221;(tm).</p>
<p>The biggest problem in Europe is that the muslims have a stronger sense of identity and common culture than us, whites are confused and scattered, and some converting to Islam. The US minorities have no such common bond except for fleecing the taxpayers, Islam is far stronger. I do not personally fear this 7th century death cult, but I do fear that their cultural beacon is brighter than ours (America), though not stronger.</p>
<p>If we remove the Islamist threat, then what? What to do with all the people that are already here? Well, the reason that they don&rsquo;t assimilate is because they are the stronger ideology, but if THAT changes, then I&rsquo;m sure they will start respecting us like America was respected in the past, and Britain before that. Taxpayers shouldn&rsquo;t be required to feed the whole country, provide jobs and opportunities and all that welfare state nonsense. Under capitalism there is no government welfare or handouts, only Justice. If nationalists want an all white town, no problem, just make a contract. Want a social safety net? No problem, just put a clause in all the property contracts for the town, exclude whoever you want, state in in plain English, it&rsquo;s not only legal, it&rsquo;s your RIGHT! Under capitalism, crime is virtually non-existent, at least after some time because capitalism promotes high-IQ people to perform, blossom and multiply. Now high-IQ people are spending all their time trying to hide money away from the tax authorities and rubbing shoulders with politicians in Washington and Brussels. Those politicians won&rsquo;t be there under capitalism, all politics will be local.</p>
<p>What we need is an ideological awakening, nationalism has failed and is dead, it&rsquo;s not viable, at least not going forward. Capitalism is the only way to achieve what you want if you&rsquo;re a nationalist, because otherwise you have to deal with all the millions of immigrants that are living among us right now, what&rsquo;s the nationalist answer to them?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the correlation between bombing the Middle East and ridding Europe of Muslims?  Is it because the European governments brought these people in for the purpose of changing public opinion on foreign policy? Nationalism is the past and it appears that by the direction in Europe, it is the future.  Otherwise, Europe becomes part of a faceless, unelected EU bureaucracy that is hell bent on one world government. Islam is a primitive, violent religion that few Europeans and especially women would consider converting to.  The problem with Europe is that it has become decadent.  What the continent needs is some good old fashioned Christian revival.  I believe in captitalism but I draw the line at importing millions of third world cheap slave workers to assault the poor and middle class, diminish wages all to increase the profits of the corporate fat cats. If that&rsquo;s what passes for capitalism nowadays it can go into the dustbin of history for all I care.   </p>

<p>Capitalism is a viable system, the mix between planned economy and capitalism we have today, a mongrel we know as &#8220;the welfare state&#8221;, is not. The mass immigration that we have today is not compatible with capitalism, but there will be some immigration of high-IQ workers and industrialists who want to live here and assimilate. Low-IQ people have little to contribute in such a society and many will forgo children to have a better life, the exact opposite of today. The problem with the nation state, or the welfare state for that matter, is that there is no rational guiding principle. I think that if people are peaceful and law abiding, they have a right to live where they want, but must respect other people&rsquo;s right to the same thing. Under capitalism people also have the right to control who can stay on their property, including businesses. This means that people can choose NOT to live with or hire muslims, or blacks, or Indians, or Chinese or whatever. Controlling a neighborhood is easily done by clauses in property contracts that regulate ethnicity, like in the old days. So the nation states are gone, and won&rsquo;t come back, but going forward we can save our civilization by going back to the roots of the United States of America. America should lead Europe, not the other way around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand the correlation between bombing the Middle East and ridding Europe of Muslims?&#8221;</p>
<p>Islam is taking over because people are giving in. Islam is aggressively winning the culture war, and we need to take it down a few notches, not just control immigration. The correlation between the invaders clout and their sense of strong ideological leadership cannot be understated IMO. I think we need to break Islam by destroying their ideological centers, Iran and Saudi-Arabia, now we&rsquo;re just egging them on with our constant stream of apologies and prostration. When the Islamic world realized that they could get away with anything, even besieging the US embassy in Tehran as well as issuing a death sentence over a British citizen, they knew that they were the stronger culture. Take out radical Islam, not by nation building, but by destroying the source, take out the regimes that protect anyone who preaches hate against the west, let them see what happens to those who oppose freedom. This can be done without a full scale war, just a few precision strikes. Don&rsquo;t put soldiers in harms way, every time they kill a westerner it&rsquo;s a small victory for them. Send in the drones, the ICBMs and the Raptors, dominate the region, but don&rsquo;t risk American lives, and don&rsquo;t build their nations for them. I don&rsquo;t think western civilization is ready for this, and that is why I think Europe will become Eurabia.</p>
<p>The US still have a fighting chance, the muslims do not have the foothold that they have in Europe, and you have a stronger sense of ideology, for instance Christianity is still strong in the US. For these, and many other reasons, the exceptional American culture will be more difficult to unseat. The US already have a host of other minorities entrenched in the system, over here there are nothing but muslims, they have the whole public scene to themselves, and our coward leaders are running their shoes off to accommodate them, losers.</p>

<p>I would think that would be obvious.  Deport! Deport! Deport!  End all immigrant welfare and birthright citizenship.  Create zoning laws and codes that make it difficult for muslims and other nonwhites to practice their religion or live off the taxpayers.  Jesus loves you billboards in the bannelous, sausage stands outside of mosques, The slightest infraction of the law, deport!  Car burnings, deport! Riots, deport! Jay walking, deport!

<p>What are you talking about?  The nation states aren&rsquo;t gone, the EU is a basketcase of conflicting national interests waiting to fall apart. Islam is not winning the culture war.  There is no culture war with the muslims.  They come into Europe and isolate themselves with their own culture while Europeans are walling themselves off from them.  Under the scenario you want to live under the multicult will still flourish with a capitalist globalist face on it.  You said that people have the right to live anywhere they want to as long as they assimilate (miscegenate) with the host population and observe their culture.  Your promoting the same old globalist garbage only your saying Whites will have the option of isolating themselves in pockets in an increasingly nonwhite Europe.  What happens when they grow in numbers and Europeans lose a lot of their political control, are they still going have the same freedoms and ability to control their destiny? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, maybe I&rsquo;m just not intelligent enough to see the connection between Islamic immigration and attacking Middle Eastern countries or maybe I do understand the points your making and want you to just come out and say it.</p>
<p>Bombing Middle Eastern countries will do nothing about the immigration problem in Europe and will set off continental wide riots of Muslims living in Europe.  How does it gid rid of Muslims in Europe, or is it not supposed to?  Europe is becoming Eurabia because European governments are allowing Arabians into Europe. Would you agree with that?</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;&hellip;.. this problem cannot be solved except for a reformation of Islam, or deportation of all muslims, which will probably lead to slaughter and a full scale war, not gonna happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if your saying we can&rsquo;t deport them, then how do we deal with them?  I&rsquo;m going to ask you again what is the point of bombing Saudi Arabia and Iran? If deporting Muslims leads to slaughter and full scale war, what do you think these Muslims in Europe will do when the Islamic world gets bombed?  The native population outnumbers these people by a very wide margin. Wouldn&rsquo;t the logical thing be to remove them from the population before their high fertility rates make them a sizeable threat?</p>
<p>&#8220;The mass immigration that we have today is not compatible with capitalism, but there will be some immigration of high-IQ workers and industrialists who want to live here and assimilate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Europeans are the smartest people in the world.  The Finns developed an excellent software operating system, German engineering is renowned worldwide and there&rsquo;s an atomic supercollider in Switzerland built with European ingenuity.  There are hundreds of other such examples of European intelligence.  How many high IQ people does a country need to function or do they have to come from the third world for it to count?   </p>
<p>&#8220;Capitalism is the only way to achieve what you want if you&rsquo;re a nationalist, because otherwise you have to deal with all the millions of immigrants that are living among us right now, what&rsquo;s the nationalist answer to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Giving people more freedom and lowering taxes so they can wall themselves off from immigrants is not exactly a solution now is it? People are either globalists or nationalists, which one are you?<br>

		<p>I think what NW European is saying is that he doesn&rsquo;t want Muslims permanently inhabiting white countries at all.  But in the happenstance of a Muslim terrorist attack or military attack, the white world must strike back in the home territory of the responsible parties, surgically, viciously and quickly, but definitely not with the mindset of invasion and reconstruction.  The reason that has to be done is, as the Romans once said, oderint dum metuant.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s necessary, fine.  But it is my contention that with Muslims not allowed in at all, or being deported like they should, it will be impossible for terrorism to happen.  Because Muslim countries and potentates and terrorist groups don&rsquo;t have the ability to launch distant strikes.  Having Muslim terrorist cells inside the victim country is a 100% necessary prerequisite for the kind of terrorism they can commit.  Sure, Pakistan (and maybe soon Iran) has/will have a nuke, but we have tens of thousands if not more.  If an AQ-type who overthrows the Pakistani government, or Ahmadinejad, launches on New York or London, they ruin New York or London.  They don&rsquo;t ruin Wichita, Fargo, Boise, Dallas, Atlanta.  Or Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham.  When we respond, their whole countries are gone.  Therefore, they might have nukes, but they won&rsquo;t launch them.</p>
<p>Also, one can have a nuke, but they&rsquo;re useless without an intercontinental launching mechanism.  The main reason Pakistan wanted to nuke up is because India did (and vice versa).  As long as a legit government has control in Pakistan, all they care about vis-a-vis their nuke is India.  And as far as Ahmadinejad, he might only want a nuke out of fear of the Americans invading Iran   &mdash;   He might have absolutely no intention of nuking London or New York, even if he could.</p>

		<p>This is a long post, but it&rsquo;s hard to say it in just a few words.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of a culture war here in Europe. It&rsquo;s a little different than the US immigration problem, we&rsquo;re being taken over by a hostile ideology, not swamped by mere immigration from the third world. Serious as that is, the closest analogy would be La Raza and their ambitions in the south west, but they look like old friends in comparison to the Islamists in Europe. Immigration is not the root cause, the loss of sense of common culture among the European people is, the populace is scattered and confused, the elites are grovelling and giving away the countries&rsquo; wealth to anyone and everyone. In the US, Christianity is strong in many places, and there is still a critical mass of people with a distinct culture of self reliance and individualism, and a love for what&rsquo;s good and decent. The US have the Tea Party, Europe has some marginalized nationalist parties, but it&rsquo;s a little too late. Muslims who come here want to live under Sharia, but they still emigrate from their Sharia run hell holes, only to make Europe the same. Immigrants to the US are still assimilating at a much higher rate than in Europe, that&rsquo;s because over here the host culture is weak and the immigrants are contemptuous of it.</p>
<p>As I see it, immigration is a moot point, the muslims are already here in their millions. Deportation is all but impossible, I think more likely that the muslim no-go zones in Europe will resemble Gaza more and more, and that they will grow and supplant everything European in the vicinity, churches are converted to mosques, pork is banned and laws are adapted to Sharia. Cities like Marseilles, Brussels, Malm철 are changing faster than ever before. Immigration is just a symptom of what&rsquo;s wrong with the culture, no policy is going to fix that deeper problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I begin my reasoning from this starting point, what to do with the muslim hordes, rather than immigration policy. I say, kill their ideology, and take away the welfare state. The reason I don&rsquo;t believe in deportation is that I don&rsquo;t think it will work. Some people have been here peacefully for decades, I don&rsquo;t support deporting innocent people. I support incarcerating criminals, and deporting them if possible, but not forcefully uprooting and deporting millions of people based on ethnicity or religion. Even if the nationalists gathered enough support to do this, it would only mean another era of European fascism instead of Islamo-fascism. Under capitalism the muslim population would be monitored, and radicals not yet jailed or deported would be constantly harassed and under strict surveillance. The problem would diminish over time, and eventually go away. I believe this is the only viable solution, and with the least calamity. All other &#8220;solutions&#8221; will be drenched in blood, we are already stained by the first trickle of Enoch Powell&rsquo;s &#8220;rivers of blood&#8221;, I just don&rsquo;t want to see that come to full fruition. Capitalism has the power to diffuse this powder keg, nationalism can only detonate it. I think most likely that the current situation will lead to bloodshed anyway, though I can&rsquo;t say exactly how, there are many different scenarios that are likely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, maybe I&rsquo;m just not intelligent enough to see the connection between Islamic immigration and attacking Middle Eastern countries or maybe I do understand the points your making and want you to just come out and say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopefully my arguments have become clearer, I&rsquo;m not attacking immigration policy but what I perceive as the greatest threat to Western Civilization since the enlightenment and the industrial revolution, the anti-enlightenment. I&rsquo;m neither a globalist or nationalist, unless everybody who is not a nationalist automatically becomes a globalist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an individualist, and to many nationalists that makes me unpalatable. I believe individuals are free to choose whatever values they like, race is not a factor. Rational productive people thrive under capitalism, crime is virtually non-existent, and there is total and uncompromising freedom of speech. Do you really want to forcefully people who are productive and peaceful, but not white, from the entire country? I think the blood-and-soil arguments are arbitrary and unreasonable, people have rights. Right now the native populations are losing rights at an unprecedented scale, we&rsquo;ve never had this encroachment on our freedom before, but taking away the rights of others is not a solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said that people have the right to live anywhere they want to as long as they assimilate (miscegenate) with the host population and observe their culture. Your promoting the same old globalist garbage only your saying Whites will have the option of isolating themselves in pockets in an increasingly nonwhite Europe&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think people have a right to breed with whomever they want? I don&rsquo;t promote miscegenation, but I wouldn&rsquo;t make laws to prevent it, people are free to choose, even if we don&rsquo;t like the choices they make. And Europe wouldn&rsquo;t become increasingly non-white if it wasn&rsquo;t for the decadent and irrational white populace, which is what I&rsquo;m attacking. They&rsquo;re digging their own graves, and the muslims are dancing on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens when they grow in numbers and Europeans lose a lot of their political control, are they still going have the same freedoms and ability to control their destiny?&#8221;</p>
<p>Capitalism isn&rsquo;t a system to control anyone&rsquo;s destiny, only to make nobody can control the destiny of others. If whites die out, it&rsquo;s our own fault, no policy or political system can change that. Capitalism, however, leaves you free to choose, and to thrive and multiply. No backward 7th century religion, or stone age tribe are going to take away our civilization under capitalism, we&rsquo;re too strong for that, only under the current system, and with The FED, the EU, The IMF, The UN and all such abominations, could we potentially loose our whole civilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many high IQ people does a country need to function or do they have to come from the third world for it to count?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not really for us to decide, I don&rsquo;t think the state should control the economy in any way. All such decisions should be done individually. &#8220;Do I want to hire an Indian, or should I go for this guy living right next to me, who has the right set of skills, but requires a higher salary?&#8221;. NOT a political question.</p>
<p>@21</p>
<p>I do not want Sharia-demanding, women-beating, anti-western, violent, chip-on-the-shoulder, welfare-receiving primitive low-IQ, Quran-quoting muslims anywhere near me, that&rsquo;s why I want to take away their reason for acting that way, bomb Mecca if necessary. The battle is ideological, crushing their ideological base will flush out the radicals, which can then be locked up or deported. The rest of the &#8220;peaceful&#8221; muslims can then be monitored and kept in check. Right now, they are just moving in like it&rsquo;s their new apartment, bombing radical mosques in the middle east will definitely have an effect.</p>

<p>Capitalism has served America well over the decades but there is an inherent flaw in the system that has gone unnoticed because the US and the West had robust native population growth until about 30 years ago.  Capitalism requires constant growth in population so that there are more consumers to buy more consumables which increases profits and creates jobs for an ever expanding population.  We have been living off the fumes of population momentum until now and now that the West has relatively stable population growth, corporations are using third world immigration as a way to keep the capitalist engine going at the expense of Western Civilization.  Unending growth has alot of consequences not the least is the fact that it is environmentally destructive and will result in the entire nation becoming a giant parking lot with no natural open areas and hundreds of millions of people crowded together and rationing of resources. Do you think capitalism at least needs to be modified and if not how are the problems of unending growth, race replacement and overpopulation solved? </p>

<p>You only selectively answered some questions and even with those you didn&rsquo;t answer them fully.  However, your vague writing should prove to anyone that there is no connection between forced government immigration policies and bomb, bomb, bomb the Middle East strategies.  Your a neoconservative globalist who wants immigration to continue apace so that these people can be exploited by cheap labor interests and assault the standard of living of the European middle class for the New World Order that seeks to make national borders obsolete under a global plantation.  You have no use for national boundaries and view people as nothing more than interchangeable consumers. There is no reason why old school capitalism can&rsquo;t thrive under a nationalist government and it has been for the all of the 20th century.  Under a nationalist government the only difference is the cheap labor pool is cut off and eliminates the source of Europe&rsquo;s woes.   </p>

		<p>I agree with others on here who say that muslim immigration is a government manufactured problem for some sinister reason. The population is being frightened and our government issues terror warnings on a continuous basis yet it seems to have no curtailing effect on our leaders&rsquo; enthusiasm for muslim immigration or any kind of immigration.  The only kind of rhetoric we hear is we must fight them over there (the Middle East) or we&rsquo;ll fight them on our own soil, which in itself reveals their intentions to never halt it.  We don&rsquo;t have to fight them anywhere we just need to remove them.  No wonder so many people believe that 911 was a conspiracy.   </p>

		<p> NW European is delsuional if he thinks that you can have huge numbers of Arabs, Pakistanis etc. in Europe and it will be okay if they are simply stripped of Islamist ideology.  </p>
<p>Look at the blacks in America:  They have been here for hundreds of years, they adopted the white man&rsquo;s religion, language and all superficial aspects of culture and they are still a much bigger problem than even your immigrants in Europe are.  </p>
<p>When you read people like NWE, you have to wonder where they get their information about the USA.  There is this bizarre idea among moderate right Europeans that America is some kind of perfect society that has already solved every problem that there own countries have.  </p>

<p>We are at war with radical Islam, and we need to win, agreed? This culture war is felt much stronger in Europe than the USA, which is inundated by ALL the third world, not just the Islamic. Capitalism is the only system that has the power to clean up our societies without a nazi-style ethnic cleansing, so in order to avoid that I advocate Capitalism with a strong emphasis on removing criminals from society, and in Islam&rsquo;s case, bombing their radical beacons, like Iran. I believe that without their Mojo to carry on and browbeat whites into accepting their presence and behavior, and being locked up and deported in large numbers will bring back both the peace and a healthy economy.</p>
<p>I mean, what is the problem, I&rsquo;m not suggesting we tolerate criminals, or any form of threat, only that we deal with it based on police intelligence, and not race, people still have free will. I know that most nationalists don&rsquo;t like this, but there are no rational arguments for having an all-white nation state, and only under capitalism is an all-white society possible. The nation state cannot be all white, only smaller communities within a state, and that state must be capitalist, if not you&rsquo;ll end up with fascism and possibly ethnic cleansing. When the state starts to manage the economy, different groups are pitted against each other, and that&rsquo;s when it all starts. Get the government out of the economy or watch it collapse. The type of multicultural lala-economy that we have now would not happen under capitalism, only a big government has the resources to bring all those millions of people in, private businesses would never get away with something like that, employing criminals doesn&rsquo;t make you money.</p>

<p>Well, I have news for you.  The culture war has all but obliterated American culture and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s muslims or other nonwhites, the result is the same.  Maybe you should visit the US and go to any major city and see what America has transformed into.  Your post is full of contradictions.  You say only capitalism can provide a White nation state but then you say you can&rsquo;t have a White nation state but only smaller communities within that state.  What passes for capitalism in a government won&rsquo;t deport immigrants or even illegals because they want that cheap labor. We aren&rsquo;t at war with Islam, certain elements in our government are.  Radical Islam largely disappears from the West when muslims no longer have contact with Western societies via immigration and the US keeps it&rsquo;s nose out of other people&rsquo;s business.      </p>

<p>I absolutely abhor what has happened in the US. I watch in disbelief and amazement as the west fades and takes it&rsquo;s place alongside the Greek city states and the Roman Empire in history, but the destruction of the greatest country EVER is just horrible. I used to live in the US and can only hope that the culture I grew up in will survive, which I think it will. The reason is the tea-party, nothing like that exists over here in Europe, and that is the big difference. Nationalists want to use the government to create a white society, but my argument is that one cannot do that, the reason being that it requires genocide and ethnic cleansing. I&rsquo;m advocating capitalism because it will allow white societies to exist, all you need is the freedom to put whatever you want into a contract, even racial clauses. Today this is just not possible. True separation is only possible (without aforementioned genocide) under capitalism.</p>
<p>BTW, I have seen more of the US than most Americans, both the real authentic America, and the watered down Euro-inspired (latte and ivory tower snobbery) big city America. I&rsquo;ve seen the crime-ridden inner cities, rode the greyhound with all the weirdos, and thought I was gonna die after I took the wrong exit on the highway in Miami. The country may be in a bad shape, but Europe is far worse because of Islam. Maybe you should visit Europe and see for yourself, the muslims are entrenched in every strata of the society and government save the royal family. They angrily demand new concessions every week, and our weak and pathetic leadership are only happy to oblige them.</p>
<p>But never mind who&rsquo;s got the worst immigrants, what is your solution? Deport them? In Europe the muslims will rise up in revolt if we try, and Europeans are not armed. What do we do, send in the army, all four platoons and the one working helicopter? My solution is one for peace and prosperity, even if it&rsquo;s not an all white nation state.</p>

<p>Read the comments, the solution is not as simple as deportation and restoration of the nation states.</p>
