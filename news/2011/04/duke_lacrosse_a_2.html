			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (London), April 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The woman who falsely accused three Duke University lacrosse players of raping her in 2006 has been charged with murder over the death of her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Crystal Mangum, 32, was indicted on Monday on a charge of first-degree murder and two counts of theft. She has been in jail since 3 April, when police charged her with assault in the stabbing of 46-year-old Reginald Daye. He died in hospital nearly two weeks later.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year she was convicted of starting a fire that nearly destroyed her home with her three children inside. She told officers she was arguing with her boyfriend at the time  &mdash;  not Daye  &mdash;  and burned his clothes, smashed his car windshield and threatened to stab him.</p>
<p>Friends said Mangum has never recovered from the stigma of the lacrosse case and has been involved in a string of questionable relationships in an attempt to provide stability for her three children.</p>
<p>Vincent Clark, a friend who co-authored Mangum&rsquo;s self-published memoir, said he hoped people would not rush to judge her. {snip}</p>

		<p>When will the blacks stop blaming whitey for their criminal behavior? Most likely NEVER. But it would be nice practice if the MSM would stop pouring gasoline on the fire of putting whitey to blame for all the shortcomings of their race. Reading the first article today regarding the influx of latin based gangs in the U S and the next article where Sharpton and Obama want to aid immigration reform, how much dumber can you be ?<br>
This should go a long way toward unelecting the present administration.</p>

		<p>Let me be the first to rush to judgement. The White Hetero-Sexist Patriarchal Oppressor System did it. It is only a matter of time until a righteous Afro-American studies professor discovers the truth; followed soon after by a wise Latina Feminist attorney proving it in court.</p>

<p><br>
If the parents of and lawyers for the Duke lacrosse players had only had the decency to let District Attorney Mike Nifong, the New York Times, Nancy Grace, the Duke administration, the infamous Duke 88 faculty members, the NC NAACP, and countless other foaming-at-the-mouth leftists railroad the racist white lacrosse players into long prison sentences, Crystal Magnum would be a much-celebated heroine of the Left today.</p>
<p>Instead she is suffering the stigma of being exposed as an outrageous liar and the perpetrator of an horrific hoax. Instead of being a heroine, she&rsquo;s facing murder charges.</p>
<p>I hope the parents of those young Duke students and their lawyers are happy at what they&rsquo;ve done to that poor girl.</p>

		<p>To the moron friend who asked that people not judge her. Yeah, a pathological liar, arsonist, child endangerer, and now accused killer should never be judged in the public eye. Especially a black one. Nobody knows the troubles I&rsquo;ve seen, and the liberal leaders don&rsquo;t seem to care. Maybe now we can finally be done with this ne&rsquo;er-do-well waste of a woman.</p>

		<p>I guess she can blame white people for her misfortune. How could they dare to fight Black Womens&rsquo; accusations and deprive her of the millions dollars, which her great grandparents earned on the plantations. Where is Jessie and Al, when she needs them the most? Maybe Obama will rush to the rescue and pardon her in 2013?<br>

		<p>Blacks never cease to amaze us.  If she had really wanted to provide stability for her children, she wouldn&rsquo;t have taken up with another black.  She would have chosen a nice Oriental or European with a mission to bring healing to the world through evangelical outreach to &#8220;the least of these&#8221;.  What does she have against bringing diversity into her home?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Jesse follow through with his offer of paying for her college education?  Why didn&rsquo;t the Duke 88 take her on as a community improvement project and let her come live with all of them on a rotating basis, or with the one who was willing to make the greatest &#8220;shared sacrifice&#8221; in the name of social and restorative justice.</p>
<p>Our failure as a community is that we don&rsquo;t yet know how to hold those accountable who support and protect criminal blacks. Anyone who came out in her favor should now be pressured into resigning from their jobs.   Until we learn how to do that, we will continue to fail and watch the lowest among us be promoted over us while we submerge under black rule and suffer the inevitable consequences.  We must spread the pain we feel to all those White liberals who &#8220;think and speak correctly about blacks, but then make enough money to live as far away from them as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any liberal White who doesn&rsquo;t live in the same kind of ghettos that breed Crystal Mangums and Lemarcus Davidsons should be immediately deported from Whiteness.</p>

		<p>You have GOT to be kidding me! Tell me Mr. Clark, do you feel sad for the three innocent men she tried so hard to destroy? Did you hope that people would not rush to judge them? Do you realise how difficult it must have been being THEM? You&rsquo;ll get no sympathy for her from THIS reader, and she will be judged exactly as she should be. As a liar and now a murderer. </p>

		<p>Chrystal Mangum (which I assume is a misspelling of Magnum) has never recovered from the &#8220;stigma&#8221; of her false claims of being raped?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?  Charles Manson claiming to have been stigmatized by the murders be supervised and personally committed? Bernie Madoff should sue his press agent for gross misrepresentation and allowing all the good he did to be ignored. </p>

		<p>Poor Crystal Gail Mangum &#8220;never recovered from the stigma&#8221; of the Duke lacrosse rape case?  Huh?  She&rsquo;s the person, more than anyone else, who created the stigma in the first place.  The woman was a sociopath in 2006; she&rsquo;s a sociopath today.  Hopefully, her next date will be with justice - as in life in prison.</p>

		<p>A recent report reminds us there are other shoes to drop in this case: </p>
<p>&#8220;A federal judge is allowing three former Duke lacrosse players falsely accused of rape to pursue a civil lawsuit against the prosecutor and police investigators who handled their case.</p>
<p>&#8220;U.S. District Judge James Beaty ruled Thursday that the players – Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans –  can pursue claims such as malicious prosecution, concealment of evidence and fabrication of false evidence against former Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong and a police investigator.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see that this British newspaper got it right from the first sentence unlike this one in which implies that there wasn&rsquo;t enough evidence to prove rape:</p>
<p><a href="/news/2011/04/former_stripper.html" rel="nofollow">/news/2011/04/former_stripper.php</a></p>
<p><i>&#8220;But the case fell apart because of a lack of evidence and Nifong was forced to resign after scathing criticism over his handling of it.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>&#8216;The case fell apart because of a lack of evidence&rsquo;? This is far different than saying the accusations were false.</p>

		<p>When you willfully and knowingly lie and try to hang a crime like rape around the necks of innocent men. When you know these actions will destroy their lives. YOU DON&rsquo;T DESERVE TO RECOVER FROM THE STIGMA!!! You deserve to be held in contempt the rest of your life. </p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip; Mangum has never recovered from the stigma of the lacrosse case and has been involved in a string of questionable relationships in an attempt to provide stability for her three children.&#8221;  But Mangum&rsquo;s stigma was totally of her making through discretionary acts.  She chose to lie about the rape, she chose to have children (three times!).  The stigma is the natural outcome of being of low moral character.  However the stigma issue is a canard, I suspect in her circles there was no stigma no matter how well earned.</p>
