<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police detained several members of a far-right vigilante group Friday after hundreds of frightened Roma women and children were bused out of a village where it was planning to train.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Red Cross said it evacuated 277 people from the village of Gyongyospata by bus to other parts of Hungary because the local Roma are concerned about potential confrontations with members of the Vedero, or Defense Force.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police detained Vedero commander Tamas Eszes on Friday afternoon, leading him away in handcuffs from the plot in the village where the training was planned.</p>
<p>Eszes, wearing in a red beret, heavy boots and camouflage gear with what appeared to be German military insignia, shouted to the other members of the group to continue with the training. Police, however, later also detained several others members of Vedero as they gathered in the village.</p>
<p>Several far-right vigilante groups, usually dressed in military-like uniforms, have been patrolling the village, and others in eastern Hungary that have large Roma populations, with the stated purpose of defending the non-Roma residents from &#8220;Gypsy crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farkas said that members of Vedero who went to the village last week to scout a location for their training camp had shouted violent threats at the Roma.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to intimidate the Roma here,&#8221; Farkas [Janos Farkas, chairman of the local gypsy council] said. &#8220;Their presence is extremely upsetting and will achieve nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Vedero leader Eszes said his group was not racist, had not taken part in anti-Roma village patrols and had no connection to any political party.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is unnecessary scaremongering and they want to put the &#8216;extremist&rsquo; tag on us,&#8221; Eszes said of the Roma evacuation. &#8220;We met earlier with Gypsy leaders and reassured them about our activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eszes said Vedero had recently purchased the 1.5-acre plot in Gyongyospata because of its low price and planned to hold training activities there every month from now on.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Eszes said his group wanted to improve the physical condition of Hungarian youths, blaming its decline partly on the elimination of the military draft, abolished by lawmakers in 2004.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hungary&rsquo;s youth are in bad physical shape, sitting in front of a computer all day,&#8221; Eszes said. &#8220;We are continuing the old Hungarian tradition of military-style training.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, Eszes said &#8220;Gypsy crime&#8221; was an &#8220;existing problem which can&rsquo;t be denied,&#8221; pointing to the high percentage of Roma among Hungary&rsquo;s prison population.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is not our problem,&#8221; Eszes said.</p>
<p>Eszes said that recent verbal confrontations in the village were started by the Roma, and that Vedero had called for police protection. &#8220;Why would three or four of us want to take on 70 Gypsies?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Vedero&rsquo;s website, which was blocked late Friday by the service provider, the training camp starting Friday was open to &#8220;all youths and adults who love their country and who are interested in learning military and self-defense basics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trainees are also encouraged to bring Airsoft weapons  &mdash;  realistic-looking pellet rifles and guns  &mdash;  and boxing gloves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Military disciplinary rules will be in effect on the campsite during the three days,&#8221; the advertisement says.</p>

<p>I periodically read news from Hungary.  The vicious crimes that the gypsies commit against the native Hungarians is atrocious.  They have no problem with raping and torturing old ladies.  This is in addition to the huge number of petty crimes they commit day in and day out.  They actually train their children to be thieves from the time they can walk.  It is a profession to them.  They refuse to integrate with the native population or obey the law.  If India won&rsquo;t take them back then ship them all off to Kosovo.  The US wrenched it away from the Serbs so I suppose at this point using it as a dumping ground for the gypsies wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.  Let the Muslims deal with them.<br>

<p>Someone should write that line down so we can remember to use it ourselves one day. This article talks about busing. Liberals instituted 20 years of forced busing in this country. A program like that should be started again. I don&rsquo;t think it will take 20 years. </p>

		<p>I have seen &#8220;Roma&#8221;   (Gypsies, I call them) in Spain, and begging and pickpocketing on the streets of Paris. Their behavior is a disgrace.  These are not civilized people,  They are wild creatures.  They are completely different from us.  They have lived in Europe for centuries now, but they are still not civilized nor Europeanized. </p>

<p>Oh, so if it looks German, it must be bad!</p>
<p>These gypsies left town on their own accord; they were not forced to leave, and sure they&rsquo;re intimidated; most criminals are when faced with people who take laws against thieves and con artists seriously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like here in the US, anything that smacks of nationalism or patriotism is suspect and &#8220;hateful&#8221;, and the foreigners get what they want.</p>

		<p>The Gypsies are are also known for kidnapping children, who are then raised to be thieves, beggars, etc.</p>
<p>Too bad they cannot all be deported back to India.</p>

		<p>They are absolutely right about the draft. The draft has some inherent problems 1. during an unpopular war you get a certain class of malcontents drafted for military service. 2. You tend to upset the public more because their sons and daughters are getting killed and didn&rsquo;t ask for this burden. 3. You could loose valuable genetic stock to military battles since these people may be better suited to be long term tax paying citizens. </p>
<p>However the draft has some inherent advantages as well and I believe these far outweigh the negatives. 1. drafted soldiers whether they are happy with their lot or not tend to benefit from the experience that is they grow physically and mentally. 2. The public in general are far more engaged in the behavior of their politicians and this cuts down on the legislative mischief that gets us into these foriegn escapades. 3. Being in the military has the added benefit of putting everybody on the same page making the divide and conquer strategies of out leaders that much harder to implement. Example: Gays and women in the military. 4. Being in the Army, would definitely raise the physical conditioning level of our young. 5. Weapons training ain&rsquo;t a bad idea. 5. Are we going to be depending upon United Nations soldiers to secure our peace? God I hope not. </p>

<p>Many years ago I lived in Spain and never saw a problem with the Gypsies. Hmmm, think it had something to do with the fact that Franco was in charge? <br>

DEAR GHW WE HAVE CREATURES LIKE THAT RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA BUT IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THEM NO MATTER HOW TRUE, THEIR HISTORY IS OF CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION YET THEY ARE A PROTECTED SPECIES IN AMERICA. SO THIS PROBLEM YOU HAVE OUTLINED IS WORLDWIDE.<br>
P.S.<br>
If you don&rsquo;t want to meet one and possibly be subjected to their animalistic behavior I would advise staying away from the Most Popular Fast Food Restaurants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite accurate for Americans to try to understand the Roma problem by merely comparing them to blacks.  From my own observation I&rsquo;d say the Roma are far more hated, far less assimilated &amp; more completely useless than blacks in the US. </p>
<p>I work with a few black folks who seem like decent people, but almost no one in central Europe could say that about a Roma.</p>

		<p>I let a Gypsy in Zagreb pick my pocket a long time ago.  The wallet was a small bomb using Semtex.  It would have been enough to take the arm completely off below the elbow for whomever opened the wallet.</p>
<p>It had no money in it.</p>

		<p>Quite a few &#8220;flaws&#8221; in this little news report.</p>
<p>First off, the gypsies were not evacuated, they went on a Easter trip, planned and financed by the Red Cross, and something that was planed before all this happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13170583" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13170583</a></p>
<p>What actually happened is that this village has been terrorized by gypsies for a very long time, and some Hungarian news channel did a report on it, interviewing the local population. What they said was that the problems were well-known but the authorities didn&rsquo;t dare to do anything about it, out of fear for being called racists and various other things.</p>
<p>This quite logically upset many Hungarians, and the defense force (Vedero) responded by putting some of their training there, but alot of other Hungarians, not affiliated with them or with any other organisation also joined up, many of them being relatives of people in the village.</p>
<p>But that which the authorities had feared, became true.</p>
<p>When someone started standing up to the gypsies, out came the racist-card and now the village is swarming with western journalists and various other &#8220;equality&#8221;-loving people.</p>

		<p>Gypsies must be repatriated to Indai/Pakistan.  They cannot be allowed to remain in Europe.  If something is not done, they be the majority of the population in several Eastern European countries by the end of the century.   </p>
