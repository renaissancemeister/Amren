<h1>Man Mangum Accused of Stabbing Dies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John McCann, Herald Sun, April 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The man Crystal Mangum is accused of stabbing has died, Durham Police Department Chief Jose Lopez Sr. said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mangum already was in jail under a $300,000 secured bond charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than likely, we will be upgrading the charge to murder,&#8221; Lopez said.</p>
<p>In 2006, Mangum, 32, falsely accused three Duke University lacrosse players of raping her. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In December, Mangum was in Durham County Superior Court for an arson trial. Jurors found her guilty of three counts of contributing to the abuse and neglect of minors, causing more than $200 in property damage to the car of the man who was Mangum&rsquo;s boyfriend and resisting a police officer. Those were misdemeanor charges. But jurors did not reach consensus on the major issue, the arson charge  &mdash;  a felony  &mdash;  so Superior Court Judge Abraham Jones declared a mistrial. Mangum was sentenced to time already served, 88 days. The Durham County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office decided not to pursue the case further.</p>

		<p>The jurors didnt reach a verdict on the arson charges. There must have been one or more black jurors,one of whom wouldnt vote for conviction.In San Francisco, jurors convicted Barry Balco on one charge of obstruction of justice,but deadlocked 11 to 1,for conviction, 3 times, on other more serious charges.There was one black juror that I am aware of. Wonder how she voted.</p>

		<p>2 Peejay:</p>
<p>I know that the jury found Bonds guilty of the one OOJ count but hung on the three perjury counts.  I have heard that one woman juror was the hangup.  I suspect a black woman, the one of whom you speak.</p>
<p>What is illogical about this verdict is that his lying to the previous grand jury (the one investigating Victor Conte and BALCO) was the basis of &#8220;obstructing justice.&#8221;  So this Bonds petit jury in essence stated paradoxically that Bonds obstructed justice by lying to the GJ but couldn&rsquo;t come to the conclusion that he actually lied to the GJ.  Either the U.S. Attorneys re-try the perjury charges or the presiding judge will have to nullify the OOJ conviction.</p>
<p>At first, I thought that a perjury conviction was necessary for Selig to delete Bonds from the record books, because a perjury conviction was &#8220;beyond a reasonable doubt&#8221; proof that Bonds roided.  But I think the OOJ conviction, because its bedrock was Bonds&rsquo;s lie that he didn&rsquo;t ever roid up, is good enough for that purpose.  I doubt Selig ever will do this, because he essentially enabled the steroid era in baseball, as he and his team owner buddies swam in cash from sheeple watching drug addicts whack baseballs over the fences.</p>

		<p>Too bad a man lost his life over this female before the law got something that will (maybe) lock her up for a few years, but on the other hand, if he was stupid enough to &#8220;date&#8221; her he probably wasn&rsquo;t really smart enough to improve the gene pool anyway.</p>

		<p>I remember being angry after it came out she had lied yet no charges were filed for a false police report.  In a sane country, one who makes up a rape charge should be thrown in jail for as long as the accused would have been if the accused had been found guilty.</p>
<p>On Bonds: Yes he took roids, but why are the Feds investigating this?  I dislike the man entirely but would have trouble convicting him of criminal behavior when he harmed no one.  </p>

So True, BUT WILL THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA COVER THIS? I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT WILL RATE MORE THAN ONE BLURB.<br>
May I be proven wrong. But I see no pigs flying yet.<br>
Remember Rodney King? His record is staggering. The media is too busy with that Zing running up their leg, to even remember the man they made rich.</p>

		<p>This is good potential fodder for any Republican candidates. Especially so, if another racist black jury denies justice and she ends up on the streets despite being caught literally red-handed. We can reasonably expect the latter. The former will demand more from the GOP than they have shown the nerve for since Willi Horton.</p>

		<p>I agree with Moi.  This &#8220;outcome&#8221; is about what so many figured would eventually happen back in those days when the Hoax business was in such full steam. Time dims memory, but wasn&rsquo;t there &#8220;The Angry Thirty&#8221; or some similar ridiculously named group of Duke &#8220;smart people&#8221; who made a lot of hay about white privilege, &#8220;racism&#8221;, etc. connected with this story?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure those super-leftists will hold to their positions even now.  &#8220;It was the stress from living in an oppressive white world that&rsquo;s to blame,&#8221;  etc., blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Of course almost all of them are Tim Wise-type trust fund white leftists who only know blacks through lefty institutions, not in real life.</p>

		<p> Have any Duke University College professors, who publically sided with Ms. Mangum, come forward to admit their mistake? Have Oprah, Jesse Jackson, or Al Sharpton apologized to the Duke Lacrosse Players? I&rsquo;m curious because I&rsquo;ve never heard of any accuser stepping forward to admit they were fooled by the Mangum hoax. </p>

		<p>#10 –There were 88 (88!) who signed the letter.  Here&rsquo;s the list of Duke professors who signed it with their field of expertise also listed: <br>

<p>BTW, I don&rsquo;t remember hearing of any outrage from those esteemed professors at Duke about this, nor do I recall hearing about this at all. Does anyone else? <br>

		<p>NC is becoming heavily Hispanic.  Combined with the large black population, that will put whites in the minority there in a generation. You would think the GOP establishment would care about this, but they seem determined to accelerate the process.  Once NC, SC, VA, GA, MS, LA, FL, AZ, NV, CO and TX go majority non-white, as they all will by mid century at the latest, conservative Republicans are done for.  Maybe that&rsquo;s what it will take for white to embrace nationalism.  </p>

		<p>I agree completely with Istvan.  Yes she was notorious and yes this further vindicates the lacrosse players but In the long run and big picture,  a black stripper stabbing some guy is non-news.  Dog bites man.</p>
<p>The REAL story is that NC has police chiefs named Jose Lopez.</p>
