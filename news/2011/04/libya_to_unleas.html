			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Squires, Telegraph (London), April 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The opening of immigration floodgates came as Italy announced that it would grant travel permits to more than 20,000 Tunisian refugees who have reached its southernmost islands in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Italian government said the temporary permits would grant the refugees freedom of movement within the visa-free Schengen area, but in reality most want to head to France.</p>
<p>Paris reacted angrily to the move, with Claude Gueant, the interior minister, saying the country would not tolerate &#8220;a wave of immigration&#8221; and warning that migrants without appropriate identity documents and sufficient funds would be prevented from entering.</p>
<p>The Schengen zone excludes Britain and Ireland, but migrants could attempt to enter the UK illegally from the Continent.</p>
<p>The Tunisians are among nearly 26,000 migrants who have managed to reach the tiny island of Lampedusa, Italy&rsquo;s southernmost territory, since January, when president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was toppled by a popular revolt.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Libya, Col. Muammar Gadaffi&rsquo;s regime is alleged to have been actively encouraging boatloads of migrants to leave the country&rsquo;s shores since March 22, when the first vessel sailed from Tajoura, a suburb of Tripoli.</p>
<p>Libyan armed forces and militias are reportedly turning a blind eye to the thousands of people, many of them sub-Saharan migrant workers who have lost their jobs, who assemble on beaches willing to pay several hundred pounds to be transported to Lampedusa.</p>
<p>The UN estimates that almost 450,000 foreigners have been uprooted by the fighting in Libya but only 218,000 have been able to return home.</p>
<p>Libya appears to be making good on threats issued at the start of the coalition&rsquo;s bombing campaign, when Moussa Ibrahim, the government spokesman, said the regime would no longer stop sub-Saharan and other refugees from trying to enter Europe by boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be illegal immigration. It is a very lucrative business and the government had taken action against it, but it cannot any more. Libyans are involved, we are not stopping it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Col. Gaddafi warned two years ago that he had the ability to turn Europe &#8220;black&#8221; unless the European Union agreed to pay his regime at least £4 billion a year to block the arrival of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Speaking during a three-day visit to Italy in Aug 2010, he warned: &#8220;Tomorrow Europe might no longer be European and even black as there are millions who want to come in.&#8221; He was accused by Italian MPs of holding Europe to ransom but repeated the threat at a summit last year.</p>
<p>At the time Libyan naval vessels were patrolling the coastline and blocking the departure of migrants, in collaboration with the Italians, but that accord has now collapsed as a result of the Libyan civil war.</p>
<p>Nearly 400 boats loaded with illegal immigrants have reached Italy since January.</p>
<p>Some do not make it  &mdash;  Italian authorities scoured the Mediterranean on Thursday in the hope of finding survivors from a boat that sank in rough seas and high winds on Wednesday, having left the Libyan coast two days earlier.</p>
<p>Around 50 people were recovered but another 250 were missing, feared drowned, amid reports that many bodies could be seen floating in the sea.<br>

		<p>Until now, I have been wholly opposed to any intervention in Libya&rsquo;s internal affairs, but now that he&rsquo;s threatened to invade the White world, let the cruise missiles fly.  Seize a chunk of Khadafy&rsquo;s territory to set up refugee camps and put all these invaders there, three hots and a cot and a place to squat.  Don&rsquo;t let their perpetual condition become ours.</p>

Why a &#8220;threat&#8221;?  Isn&rsquo;t this a generous act, to allow Europe to grow stronger, since &#8220;diversity is a strength&#8221;?</p>
<p>Or then again, Europe could simply conquer Libya, thus making Libya more diverse.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Libya to Unleash Wave of Migrants on Europe&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Italalian government doesn&rsquo;t return these people to Libya, they&rsquo;re going to suffer severe consequences for it.  Their economy is in shambles and the native resentment and anger at the blacks and others already there is at a high pitch.  </p>
<p>A few months ago the authorities in two towns had to move blacks to a protected location, because the townspeople were ready to take the law into their own hands with some vigilante justice, because of numerous and vicious black crimes.  The situation hasn&rsquo;t developed into violence yet, but Italian anger is still running high.  It won&rsquo;t take much for them to again take to the streets, especially with arrogant free loaders like this last bunch who feel as if Europe should welcome them with open arms.</p>
<p>Europe is further down the road to insolvency than the US.  Portugal is in dire straits; Spain is only temporarily at a lull; and Ireland and Greece are running out of the billions loaned to them to keep them afloat.  All of Europe, even Germany, is spending the last of the stimulus money injected into the various economies right now, so it will be right back to street protests before long.</p>
<p>While returning these last groups of free-loaders won&rsquo;t mean chaos in Europe will not occur, it will mean they will have fewer malcontents to deal with in the next year or two, which, at this crucial point, is VERY important.</p>

		<p>Mandatory birth control on mindless breeding and deportation on third world peoples are long overdue, here and in Europe.  But this will take guts which is hard to find in whites of today.  What will it take?  The Chinese have no problems protecting their borders even when the Westerns condemn them.  Will the Chinese have to step up and enforce mandatory birth control in the future on other third world peoples?  This planet does not have endless resources and space.  </p>

<p><br>
Let&rsquo;s remember that Libya was an Italian possession not that long ago&hellip; within my lifetime, in fact. So was Somalia!  </p>
<p>Europeans were foolish to have given up control of these barbarous places and set them loose to manage (mis-manage) their own affairs. None of these troubles would be happening today if Europeans were still in charge.</p>
<p>Giving independence to  these colonial possessions was a disaster. Now, the  colonies are giving the orders, and are colonizing the mother countries in reverse, destroying the civilization that Europe tried to bring them.</p>

		<p>Several years ago the European Nations became concerned about the negative effects of illegal immigrants and enlisted Libya to blockade its coast. Gaddafi used his military to cut off a major corridor for African immigrants in exchange for money and aid. The US even had an agreement to sell Gaddafi troop transport vehicles. Libya had seemingly become a nation that was being a partner in the international community. The revolution in Egypt was so fast and peaceful it was easy to know that revolution would spread in this region of dictators. Any thinking person knew that not all dictators would leave as easily as Mubarak in Egypt. Gaddafi responded to rebellion with his military and if the US and Europe had stayed out of it, the revolution would now be over. Gaddafi would still be in power and eager for more aid and money. Most likely he would have continued his blockade of immigrants as after publicly decrying his actions, Europe would quietly give him money. Now after US and NATO getting involved, illegal immigrants will flood out of Africa through Libya into Europe in greater and greater numbers. No matter who controls Libya the floodgates are open and will stay that way.</p>

		<p>Gaddafi has a more powerful weapon the the atom bomb, he has the population bomb and knows how to use it.  Silly Europeans are powerless to stop it as they open their borders with love and tolerance for all who wish to partake of their civilization.  Gaddafi may be a madman, but he is no fool.  Europe&rsquo;s leaders may not be madmen, but they are fools.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m proud that I was right from the start about Gadhafi and the true nature of the invasion. Islamic democracies to replace semi-secular dictatorships, weak borders to replace strong ones and Blacks &amp; Middle Easterner Muslims to replace European Christians, us. Long live brother Gadhafi! He was anti-Saud, anti-Muslim imperialist &amp; anti-al Qaeda just like Saddam.</p>

		<p>Ghadaffy Duck was saying this even before the airstrikes started.  These threats are what probably really provoked the airstrikes.  Europe already has enough Third-Worlders on welfare and burning cars in Paris every year at Christmas.  If he keeps running his stupid mouth, the Duck is going to get the ground war he doesn&rsquo;t want.  Libyan forces couldn&rsquo;t beat Chad a decade ago; do they think they can handle NATO?</p>

<p>Fair&rsquo;s fair. Why should Gaddafi continue policing the Mediterranean border if the Europeans are protecting the rebels? They&rsquo;ve declared war on him by taking sides.<br>
If Europeans are too lilly-livered to protect their own borders and need to outsource the dirty work to Libya, then they should&rsquo;ve stayed out of it.</p>

		<p>Gaddafi has my sympathies.  The multicultis in Paris, London, and DC are the ones at fault.  Now, they get a huge dose of diversity and cultural enrichment, just like they always say they need and want.  If I were Gaddafi, I would be running a ferry service to Lampedusa and providing each &#8220;immigrant&#8221; with a printed brochure on how to apply for benefits in France and the UK.</p>

		<p>Maybe the Western powers could &#8216;kill two birds with the one stone&rsquo; and hire Somali pirates to hunt down the refugee boats.<br>
It&rsquo;d give the pirates a focus and income away from kidnapping Western ships, you know &#8220;idle hands makes the Devil&rsquo;s plaything&#8221;. <br>
You&rsquo;d only have to move them over the other side of the Suez canal. The dirty work gets done, and the West&rsquo;s hands stay (relatively) clean.<br>
But seriousily.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a YT video of an Gaddafi interveiw that did the rounds not so long ago, on how Gaddafi views the whole asylum seeking &#8216;scam&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8216;How Libya Gaddafi treats asylum seekers&rsquo; <br>
(Oct 4, 2009)<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n3SuGEXxX8" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n3SuGEXxX8</a></p>
<p>@ 3:10 mins.<br>
Narrator says: Gaddafi never signed the UN convention on refugees.<br>
Gaddafi says: &#8220;As for political asylum, Africans have no problems with politics, none at all, that&rsquo;s one of the tricks and lies you hear&#8221;. &#8220;They say we&rsquo;re here for political asylum. Africans don&rsquo;t have this problem, these are people who live in the jungle, in the deserts&#8221;. &#8220;They know nothing of parties, elections or opposition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Western egalitarianism means we treat non Westerner&rsquo;s, better than they treat themselves.<br>
Where&rsquo;s the deterrent? And what is our tipping point?</p>

Also, all of the atrocities committed by the Iraqis were not committed against the Kuwaitis, they were, in the main, done against Indian, Philippino and other nationalities enslaved by the muslims!</p>

		<p>Europe was better off under socialist/Communist regimes from the mid 1960s on. I went to East Germany, talked with Ossies after reunification. East Germany and countries like Yugoslavia weren&rsquo;t as rich as say West Germany or the rich parts of the USA, but White Europeans lived OK and there were few if an problems with non White immigration. East Europeans did their own work - even in fast food restaurants.</p>
<p>Folks here at American Renaissance and in the American patriot, conservative movements need to get away from Libertarian ways of thinking and voting. If you make individual liberty your main focus, people will do whatever the want and not work for the common good of our White Indo European Country. Businesses will always be looking for ways to bring in cheaper non White labor and nothing will really be done about immigration, including this Camp of the Saints invasion.</p>

		<p>The NATO Mediterranean fleet could blockade the Libyan shoreline, but that would be an acknowledgment that illegal immigration can be halted using military muscle and tactics.</p>

		<p>So why is it that Europeans cannot declare an emergency EEZ around Lampedusa and any other effected islet and then use &#8216;national interests&rsquo; (fisheries disruption) or a disease threat or or or to bypass the 1950&rsquo;s Refugee Act (any national refugee problem shall not be ignored or turned back)?</p>
<p>For that matter, let&rsquo;s simply use the economic conditions of Europe and the U.S. to highlight the fact that race-X cannot come &#8216;because there are no jobs for you!&rsquo; as a precondition to revoking that treaty.  It&rsquo;s not racist to say that 90% of the worlds population cannot invade the 10% which work hard and control their breeding.  It&rsquo;s simple fiscal responsibility.</p>
<p>It would only take one gutsy country to start the stampede away from that absurd piece of white dispossession as parchmented proof of migratory population INSANITY and then the Italian Navy could take care of the matter.  Far more competently than the Libyans.</p>
<p>The alternative is dirty tricks.  There are chemical additives which, when put in gasoline, will fall out of solution after a given time and form deposits which thermally embrittle or caustically corrode metal.  Utterly wrecking cylinder bore linings and fuel injectors.</p>
<p>Or you can go the limpet route ala the Italian operation in Alexandria Harbor in WWII.  Something the size of a penlight could easily (soundlessly, if it&rsquo;s white phosphorous below the waterline) put a hole just sufficient to sink a boat at it&rsquo;s moorings.  Better to ride a pig than be overrun by welfare bandits.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t amazing how nobody talks about or thinks about such solutions to _hostile invasion_ (20,000 men = 1 division) so long as the race word is invoked to imply that we are picking on an inferior people when in fact not wanting to put such unskilled, brutish, criminals _on government charge_ is exactly why such &#8216;racism&rsquo; is a necessary economic truth?</p>

		<p>The problem is not market economics but the welfare/warfare state. Many immigrants to the US did not stay, as they could not make it on their own. This was a natural check and balance. By subsidizing poverty, the welfare state has turned a benefit into a liability. Social democratic states like Sweden worked for some time, but have staggered under the double blows of stagnation and now unassimilable immigration. For the US, the solution is simple - re-legalize recreational pharmaceuticals, abolish the welfare state, return immigration law to what is was before the 1965 changes, and the US can easily res-stabilize itself.</p>

		<p> <i>So why is it that Europeans cannot declare an emergency EEZ around Lampedusa and any other effected islet and then use &lsquo;national interests&rsquo; (fisheries disruption) or a disease threat or or or to bypass the 1950&rsquo;s Refugee Act (any national refugee problem shall not be ignored or turned back)?</i></p>
<p>************************<br>
These various Refugee Acts that now hamstring us  and are destroying ALL our nations, are the poisonous result of WW2, which is still haunting us.  If not for WW2, we would still have strong immigration controls and no Refugee Acts to undermine us as they are doing. That war (and WW1) was a disaster for white civilization, for white humanity.   We should never, never have gotten sucked into it!</p>
