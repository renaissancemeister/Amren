<h1>Superman Renounces U.S. Citizenship in &#8216;Action Comics&rsquo; #900</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>After recently undertaking a journey to walk  &mdash;  not fly  &mdash;  across the United States in the &#8220;Grounded&#8221; storyline and reconnect with the country and everyday Americans, Superman appears to be taking another step that could have major implications for his national identity: in Action Comics #900 .&nbsp;.&nbsp.;</p>
<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Superman announces that he is going to give up his U.S. citizenship. Despite very literally being an alien immigrant, Superman has long been seen as a patriotic symbol of &#8220;truth, justice, and the American way,&#8221; from his embrace of traditional American ideals to the iconic red and blue of his costume. {snip}</p>
<p>The key scene takes place in &#8220;The Incident,&#8221; a short story in Action Comics #900 written by David S. Goyer with art by Miguel Sepulveda. In it, Superman consults with the President&rsquo;s national security advisor, who is incensed that Superman appeared in Tehran to non-violently support the protesters demonstrating against the Iranian regime, no doubt an analogue for the recent real-life protests in the Middle East. However, since Superman is viewed as an American icon in the DC Universe as well as our own, the Iranian government has construed his actions as the will of the American President, and indeed, an act of war.</p>
<p>Superman replies that it was foolish to think that his actions would not reflect politically on the American government, and that he therefore plans to renounce his American citizenship at the United Nations the next day  &mdash;  and to continue working as a superhero from a more global than national perspective. {snip}</p>
<p>While this wouldn&rsquo;t be this first time a profoundly American comic book icon disassociated himself from his national identity  &mdash;  remember when Captain America became Nomad?  &mdash;  this could be a very significant turning point for Superman if its implications carry over into other storylines. Indeed, simply saying that &#8220;truth, justice and the American way [is] not enough anymore&#8221; is a pretty startling statement from the one man who has always represented those values the most.</p>
<p>{snip} Superman also says that he believes he has been thinking &#8220;too small,&#8221; that the world is &#8220;too connected&#8221; for him to limit himself with a purely national identity. As an alien born on another planet, after all, he &#8220;can&rsquo;t help but see the bigger picture.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Comic books have been political for at least fifty years, and probably a lot longer. X-Men was an allegory for the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Captain America and Wonder Woman fought Nazis. The Japanese used manga as propaganda during their conquest of Manchuria, depicting the Japanese as police officer dogs, and the Chinese as uncivilized pigs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not new, but if they can kill off Captain America, they can make Superman a New World Order stooge.</p>

		<p>I guess.  But how is Superman an American citizen at all?  He was not an anchor baby, being born on Krypton.  And what about Clark?  I suppose that Ma and Pa Kent adopted baby S as an abandoned child, so at least he is a citizen, albeit under false pretenses.  My suggestion would be to deport them both to Mexico, or some other Third World hell-hole so he/they can enjoy the real benefits of world citizenship, whatever that means.  </p>

		<p>Well, as the story goes, the little Kryptonite did enter into the U.S. illegally when his spacecraft landed. And Ma and Pa Kent did have the blind doctor fill out a false birth certificate. So there was a charade all along. And perhaps Superman did get amnesty under the Amnesty of 1984, but only if he filled out the right paperwork. Did he do so? Even for Superman [Clark Kent] we must follow the law letter and spirit, as I even do myself. And as for the Daily Planet, please, they to the &#8220;best of their knowledge&#8221; thought that Clark was eligible to work in the U.S., so there.</p>

		<p>If people are surprised by this, they shouldn&rsquo;t be. Virtually every form of media is very biased when it comes to these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Soon Super Man will be adopting African children and will start fighting racial discrimination! </p>

		<p>America is lost&hellip; not in the sense of being confused, but lost to the world as a nation.  It is now only a matter of time before we are condemned to authoritarian rule or break apart into smaller, poorer, and weaker nation-states.  In the meantime, as we &#8220;brown-out&#8221; and move away from White, Western Civilization, just what, in heaven&rsquo;s name, are we going to do with that pesky (White) Statue of Liberty?:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/322atu" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/322atu</a><br>

		<p>Comic books are just one area where Marxist oriented fools are working to influence public thought, of course, and everybody is already aware of how they control the media, Hollywood and other parts of society, so this is just more of the same.</p>
<p>History is rife with the carcasses of failed, controlled societies that have some hare-brained ideology behind them promoted by buffoons who think things will be different with themselves behind the scheme, and this current debacle will end in violence as have most of all the others.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a certainty.  The only question is what will be the accelerant that ignites the whole mess:  Will it be economic, racial or a catastrophe brought on by nature?</p>

		<p>Well, then lets see Marvel and DC comics stop using WHITES as &#8216;Heros&rsquo;, and have the comics become totally multicult, with no whites, see how good they sell. </p>
<p>-They killed Capt. America a few years ago. Too white I guess.</p>
<p>-Thor movie is about a BLACK &#8216;Norse&rsquo; super-hero, lets see how well that does.<br>
PC is getting worse and worse, and if we lose the Supreme court in a few years, we could loose freedom of speech. </p>
<p>-America is a Third World country right now, its just a matter of slow strangulation before total collapse.</p>

		<p>Superman is a refegee, the only survivor of Kyrpton. (Excpet for Supergirl, Krypto, ect.)I remember a issue in the 60&rsquo;s where congress passed a law making him a citizen. Can&rsquo;t remeber what issue. Clark Kent is still a US citizen.<br>
   I feel he is doing this as a protest against the corruption of the Barack Obama administration. At times I feel like giving up my citizenship to protest Obama. Besides Illegal immigrants are treated so much better in the USA nowadays.<br>
   I do not mind this storyline if Kal-El becomes like the guy in man without a country and regrets it. This will also give him a chance to show how currupt the UN and other nations are. Somehow I do not think that is how the story will go.</p>

		<p>Even if he ditches the American way, &#8220;Truth and Justice&#8221; will not go down well in Iran. Iran, like all Muslim countries, is strongly opposed to both Truth and Justice.</p>
<p>Of course, Superman doesn&rsquo;t need to &#8220;non-violently support the protesters demonstrating against the Iranian regime&#8221;. He could easily just walk in and fly away with every member of the Iranian regime and detain them somewhere in Antarctica. He can then declare himself president of Iran, and announce that Iran would now be following the ideology of Truth and Justice. But I&rsquo;m guessing Superman doesn&rsquo;t have the integrity for that.</p>

		<p>Is this really that surprising? They are turning our own creations and legends against us. Hannibal, Thor, Superman, Cleopatra and the list goes on and on. It truly is a case, in their minds, that White equals evil and bad and &#8220;people of colour&#8221; are good and wholesome.  </p>
<p>The truly interesting part of this comic is what Superman actually says. It cannot be &#8220;truth or justice&#8221; that is the problem. It has to be the American &#8220;WAY&#8221; that is now seen as racist and oppressive. The comic writers, like the &#8220;wonderful Messiah&#8221;, want to see themselves as &#8220;world citizens&#8221; and therefore Superman must now switch allegiance. </p>
<p>Never mind the fact that, in the comic, two American humans took him in and brought him up so that he could thrive. He now decides to turn his back on them, which is awfully similar to Barack Obama and turning his back on the White part of his genetic make up that gave him everything. </p>

Laugh all you want, but truth is truth.</p>
<p>We Could:</p>
<p>1. Deport SUPERMAN back to Krypton (but) it would cost hundreds of millions just to build the rocket, plus I think Krypton does not even exist any more.</p>
<p>2. Just accept the fact he was never really an American Citizen much like many people feel about our President and ignore our rules, laws and culture as we have done for him?</p>

		<p>This is a brilliant marketing ploy. Just look at all the attention this washed-up superhero is getting.</p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities here:</p>
<p>1. They&rsquo;re pulling some kind of &#8220;New Coke&#8221; stunt. Superman will talk about renouncing his American citizenship, working everyone into a lather, then he&rsquo;ll break down and proclaim tearfully that he can&rsquo;t abandon &#8220;the greatest country on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. Superman will go international, severing his ties with the Great Satan in order to reach into foreign markets that increasingly see the US as a bankrupt terrorist state that gropes little kids at airports.</p>
<p>In any case, who cares what Superman does? I always thought he was one of the most forgettable superheroes. Real men read the original Magnus Robot Fighter comics with art work by Russ Manning. Magnus could crush a solid steel insane robot with one judo chop. SQUEEEEE!</p>

		<p>Captain America was killed off because, with his symbolic costume and old-fashioned demeanor, he never made an effort to distance himself enough from the &#8216;bad ol&rsquo; days&rsquo; of &#8216;ignorant&rsquo; America.</p>
<p>Superman is likely being changed because he is too symbolic of an America that was a true unapologetic superpower (his name and can-do -anything ability), but now has to learn it&rsquo;s place in the NWO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised Spider-Man hasn&rsquo;t come out of the closet yet, or married a black woman.</p>

<p>Right, very dangerous and to be taken VERY SERIOUSLY! The Iranian will NOT understand that this is a fantasy, a cartoon, a comic, make believe. They will believe it IS FOR REAL and will take it without reservation as being serious! Take it to heart. We might laugh at it but they do not.

		<p>Lois Lane, if she had known the truth, would have help out Clark by marrying once she knew was not a despicable American white male, but an illegal alien, and not even a human being too boot!</p>
<p>As the comic evolved, Clark came out as Superman, and Lois did marry Clark. But all through the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Lois mooned over Superman and snubbed the dutiful Clark. This comic was so far ahead of its time.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m giving away a free story here. Clark is not a human being and, as noted, cannot be a U.S. citizen. Let&rsquo;s imagine a story where the U.S government decides to deport Clark, and Clark doesn&rsquo;t want to go. What would that lead to? Kryptonite bombs? Mass roundups based on rumors that Clark is disguising himself as an Arab/Mexican/African America/Russian or whatever? Maybe he will just pack himself back up into his spaceship and take off searching for another yellow star with a more compatible civilization, ending the greatest story ever told. Too bad his sister, Kara Zor-El, is dead. She could stay, of course.</p>

<p>He will be unable to provide a birth certificate until someone Very High up in Washington gives him a name and address in Central America.</p>
<p>He will then acknowledge he was at the birthing in Kenya but was sworn to secrecy. He will also admit to smoking grass with someone from his college days named (Barry).</p>
