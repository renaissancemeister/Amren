<h1>Teen Speaks About Near Fatal Firework Shooting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lauren Trager, Arkansas Matters, July 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hole ripped through his leg. That&rsquo;s what a young man is recovering from in the hospital tonight, after someone fired a firework at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still recovering from all the burns and the trauma and everything like that,&#8221; Taylor Williams said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s leg was ripped open by a firework, narrowly missing an artery.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said they pulled pieces of firework, like shrapnel out of my leg,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;So is there any doubt in your mind that they meant to do this to you guys?&#8221; asks the reporter. &#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Jordan Neumeier.</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s friends say what happened at this park in Maumelle on the fourth of July was intentional.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d just finished setting off fireworks of their own when they say someone in a group nearby took aim &hellip; a large artillery shell coming right at them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s mom is so thankful he&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could have hit in a different place and he wouldn&rsquo;t be here today and that would just &hellip; uh..shake you to your core,&#8221; said Charletta Williams.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Taylor, though, just wants justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want them to know how bad they hurt me and be punished for it,&#8221;</p>
<p>Police right now don&rsquo;t have many leads, only that a group of black males may have fired the shot.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>The only thing my father ever struck me for, or any of his kids,  was an incident of  &#8220;damned fooishness!&#8221; Defined in this case as having a bottle rocket duel locked in a garage while balanced atop a step ladder and returning fire at a black sheep older brother. <br>
 When the old man saw how close a spent missile had landed to the  open gas can he looked at both of us then walked over and cuffed me across the mouth. I was stunned. So was my brother. After Dad stormed out, my big brother  rushed down from his perch to look at my lip, then sagged against me in an act of supplication.<br>
  &#8220;Why didn`t you tell him it was all my doing?!?!&#8221;, he asked. I responded with more charity than the situation called for, &#8220;Hell man, He just hit a 13 year old boy in the mouth! What`ll think he`ll do to a 19 year old Sonar Tech?!?!&rsquo; </p>

<p>Yes, Tim, we have to wonder, when will the idiotic charade end? How long can these reports stay off the mainstream media&rsquo;s screens, or- how long can white Libtards live in ignorance or denial of these growing mob attacks?</p>
<p>It boggles the mind, but no whites know of these things, unless they scan the &#8216;net, to sites like this. </p>
<p>We MUST be nearly at the breaking point.<br>
Blacks just keep stepping it up and up (but then again, what average white knows, remembers or cares about the OUTRAGES committed by Raza revolutionaries on our streets&hellip;acts tantamount to WAR?<br>

		<p>Blacks face no deterrent. The crazy white liberals (e.g. the SPLC, MSNBC)are concerned exclusively with white transgressions. <br>
Those who are concerned with white safety and the quality of life are a small, powerless minority. Expect no relief!<br>

		<p>My main emotion about all this is disappointment. 30 years ago I thought that white prejudice was the big problem, but after all these years of bending over backwards, what we end up with is a black population intent on harming us whatever way they can. </p>

<p>There are no leads?  Well we know there are plenty of witnesses.  </p>
<p>If the media covers this story and if the police/city puts out award money, somebody will talk.  But as it is, the media wont say anything, nobody will put out award money, and blacks will continue in their racist no snitch policy.  That&rsquo;s reality.</p>

		<p>The media was too busy covering the Casey Anthony trial to mention this or other black mob attacks on innocent whites.  Just as they were too busy reporting on Anna Nicole Smith to waste their time on such an insignificant crime as 5 blacks carjacking, raping, torturing, then executing 2 innocent white college students in January, 2007.  Seems they ALWAYS find more important things to report than black-on-white crimes.</p>

		<p>#7   &mdash;   do ya think they&rsquo;d let Casey Anthony cover it up if a bunch of whites decided to fight back and shot all the blacks who tried to injure them (with some success?)  Fat chance.  It&rsquo;d be front page news everywhere, about white bigotry.  There would be no mention of the fact that blacks started it decades ago, and have pushed the white population so hard that we are getting to the point that we&rsquo;re NOT willing to put up with it any more&hellip;.</p>

<p>My relative lives in an apartment complex where an older black man told him that his friends were all buying guns lately.. My relative asked him where they are getting their guns. He said from gun shops. (they must not have criminal records)&hellip;.When asked why they are buying these guns, the black man said in a lowered voice, &hellip;war.  That was all he said. Wonder if the cops on the streets know about this. I bet they do know. The police will be no match for these mobs. Anarchy will prevail.</p>
<p>War with WHO? War against the Whites is what I figure. </p>
<p>Many of us older Whites do not have any guns and cannot even afford one, let alone protect ourselves, since we are surrounded by blacks and Mexicans. They outnumber us ten to one.  Even Whites with guns cannot defend themselves against MOBS of nonwhites who will storm their homes and neighborhoods by the thousands. They have all sorts of weapons that we only dream about. How is one or two guns going to stop these mobs from torching your home, or keep any of them from smashing out your windows and doing home invasions on a grand scale? The &#8220;elite&#8221; have made all this possible since they are the ones responsible for integrating our neighborhoods and cities with nonwhites to where we are like a tiny island with them surrounding us as our &#8220;neighbors&#8221;? So much for banding together. </p>
