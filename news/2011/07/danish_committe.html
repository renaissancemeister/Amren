<h1>Danish Committee Approves Government&rsquo;s Controversial Border Control Plans</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Washington Post, July 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Denmark on Friday approved a decision to re-establish permanent customs checkpoints at its borders, removing the last hurdle to a plan aimed at stopping crime and illegal immigration but which has been strongly criticized in Europe as violating visa-free travel rules.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Germany and the European Union say border checkpoints violate EU rules on unrestricted travel in the Schengen zone and regulations on free movement within the bloc. In Denmark, opponents say it is a sop to nationalists, business organizations fear it will harm Danish exports and locals envision long lines of cars waiting to cross borders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It has said the plan would not violate any rules and that it will work closely with the EU head office in Brussels. The EU is concerned that the plan will send out a wrong signal at a time when European nations are bickering over both borders and currency.</p>

<p>NYT:</p>
<p><i>Ten years ago, as Denmark joined the European Union&rsquo;s visa-free open travel zone, the outraged Danish People&rsquo;s Party bought a decommissioned border guardhouse, vowing that one day it would be in use again.  Back then, most Danes dismissed the move as a colorful publicity stunt by the newly formed right-wing party.  But last month, the Danish People&rsquo;s Party was doing a victory dance, offering to donate its picturesque brick guardhouse at the German border to the government. The party had achieved its goal: Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen had agreed to restore 24-hour customs control in exchange for support on a difficult budget package.</i></p>
<p>Then you win.</p>

<p>The EU government needs to get a clue. The bickering over borders and currency is exactly why Denmark devised its new immigration plan in the first place.  I&rsquo;m sure that the &#8220;signal&#8221; is quite right. Are they afraid that other European nations may awaken also?  </p>

		<p>As soon as I saw the word &#8220;controversial&#8221; in the headline, I knew it was going to be a good thing.  &#8220;Controversial,&#8221; in governmediaspeak, means &#8220;Us Media Lords don&rsquo;t like it!&#8221;<br>

		<p>If Denmark needs immigrant workers there are plenty of jobless people in Greece, Ireland and Spain right now.  How about the four million whites in South Africa.  They would jump at the chance of a new life in Denmark.</p>

		<p>open immigration can&rsquo;t coexist with a strong social safety net; if you&rsquo;re going to assure health care and a decent income to everyone, you can&rsquo;t make that offer global.<br>

The sooner European Social Democrats realize that, the better of a chance they will have to preserve European Social Democracy. <br>
 <br>
It would be nice if liberals in the United States would realize that too. </p>

		<p>Denmark let in too many losers: refugees from Somalia, villagers from far Eastern Anatolia, Pakistanis who had EU settlement rights due to their relationship with the UK. Unsophisticated, uneducated, and very very hard to assimilate. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lesson here for the US: let in those who will enhance our power, whose kids will be part of the middle class. Don&rsquo;t let in uneducated villagers, traumatized refugees. In other words, let in those who graduate with a PhD from our universities, let in those who are eager to serve in our military. Keep out the flood of villagers from Mexico; don&rsquo;t accept any more refugees. </p>

		<p>The new policy will be attacked using anti-hate principles. The same types of people who will be blocked at the border are already living in Denmark. Many have citizenship and Danish born children. To stop more from entering implies that the ones already in Denmark are a menace. So there are two classes of citizens; real Danes and easily assimilated non-Danes, and the undesirable types of Danes that need to be stopped from increasing. So far this method of attack has been effective in preventing many countries from controlling borders. We&rsquo;ll have to see if Denmark can get away with it. </p>

		<p>A strong sign that opposition to the European Union is rising in Europe.  If the EU tries to fight this, it will interesting to see how far the Danes will go to re-establish border security.</p>

		<p>The Danes will not budge on this, I live across the water so<br>
I often watch their newsprograms. Furthermore they managed like<br>
us and the Brits to keep our national currency which is good<br>
because I think the Euro is doomed, when the Germans get tired<br>
of supporting failing economies in various countries it will end.</p>

		<p>Hey Rudyard - will your PHD graduates from your universities (lots of Asians there) be able to wade in to mobs of rioting, raping Muslims, Blacks?</p>
<p>I suggest letting in lots of healthy, tough blue collar Whites - high school drop outs who know how to fight and actually enjoy a fight are a lot better when the $&*# goes down.</p>

		<p>Danmark is doing the right thing,finally. After all, the open border policy was meant to facilitate free movement for Real Europeans and not to give free passes to unwanted third world invaders.<br>
Europe for Europeans. Other EU Counties should do the same.</p>
