			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bennett, American Thinker, June 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The editor of a major newspaper has just admitted that he prints propaganda.  There is no other way to describe the decision of Chicago Tribune editor Gerould W. Kern, who refuses to report on the racial aspect of recent mob attacks in Chicago.</p>
<p>Kern explains his paper&rsquo;s &#8220;approach&#8221; to concealing the truth: &#8220;We do not reference race unless it is a fact that is central to telling the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>That explanation is absurd to the point of dangerousness.  How is anybody supposed to know what is central to a story unless the news reports on the basic facts?  If blacks attack non-blacks, and you want to tell a story about blacks attacking non-blacks, then you reference race.</p>
<p>Taking Kern&rsquo;s ideas at face value, we can see just how shockingly illogical they are.  If race isn&rsquo;t central to a story, then neither is age, gender, or the location of an attack.  As another Tribune writer pointed out, &#8220;[r]ace alone doesn&rsquo;t predict or explain behavior. Just because this mob was young and black hardly means that all young, black people in groups are a violent mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think that through with a few analogies.  Take gender: gender alone doesn&rsquo;t predict or explain behavior.  Just because a rapist is a male hardly means that all males are rapists.  Therefore, we shouldn&rsquo;t report on the gender of rapists.  Obviously, this is an absurd approach.  If we never reported the gender of rapists, we would have no idea what the nature of the crime was, who was being victimized, and whose culture needed to be changed to address the root causes.</p>
<p>Also, the location of a crime alone doesn&rsquo;t predict or explain behavior.  Just because a crime occurred in a park hardly means that everyone in the park will be victimized by crime.  Therefore, we shouldn&rsquo;t report on the location of crimes.  That approach is senseless as well.  If we never reported the location of crimes, we wouldn&rsquo;t understand the basic risks we face or what areas to focus crime prevention on.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What would you think about the following words if they were uttered by an editor, speaking about white attacks on blacks?  &#8220;We will be measured and responsible about introducing racial descriptions into the coverage unless they are clearly pertinent and warranted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of us would smell the disgusting stench of double standards.  We would revolt at the paternalistic elitism involved in social engineering through journalism.  We might even sense the danger of being lied to about a racist crime wave.</p>

		<p>&#8220;admitted that he prints propaganda&#8221; Nowhere is the tag line, &#8220;We beat the Soviet Union, now we are them!&#8221; more evident than in how the media operates. Someone just posted how the headlines should read, Teenage Euphemisms Attack White Shoppers.<br>
As for the Russian style of reporting, the best story I ever heard was how the U.S. trounced the U.S.S.R. in an athletic one on one match race. Next days Pravda headlines read, &#8220;Soviets finish second in close race, while U.S. comes in next to last&#8221;&hellip;<br>

		<p>Back in the 80`s I was still reading the Daily paper. In it they had a feature called &#8220;Police Blotter&#8221;, which decribed the overnight crimes and their location. So I got a map and bought some pins. In about ten days you had a real good idea of where the crime was and who lived in the neighborhood. In fact, after three weeks, I was on the verge of giving up tracking them because my map was too crowded to stick more pins in, where all the crime was. As my manager and I were pondering the successful failure of the situation a busboy walked in and said we should start to just put a red pin down for every ten White ones. He got promoted from bus tubs to bar ice bucket that very day.</p>

		<p>And you&rsquo;re telling me no one thought to ask him how a story involving 100% black mobs attacking white people doesn&rsquo;t have race as a central facet of the story?</p>
<p>I highly doubt that.</p>

		<p>I remember an amusing incident some years ago while I was driving to work and listening to KYW, Philadelphia&rsquo;s news station.</p>
<p>The item being reported was a murder in center city, in which the clothing of the attacker, his estimated height and weight, and sundry other facts were reported in considerable detail. His race, clearly the most relevant portion of the description, was omitted.  When I got to the office I called and got the station manager and rather forcibly called his attention to the omission.  </p>
<p>He seemed a bit embarrassed and promised to check into it.  Interestingly, when the segment aired during the next cycle the suspect was identified by race.</p>

		<p>The Police Chief of Milwaukee called the recent attack by &#8220;youths&#8221; to be barbaric.  And it was.  But did he call it racist?  No.  Nor did the Mayor.  They sought to suppress the racist mini-riot in Milwaukee the night of July 3.  Videos of looting of a BP gas station revealed the color of the &#8220;youths.&#8221;  But Black racist  violence is a forbidden phrase, though a dangerous reality, in liberal Americans cities. </p>

		<p>I keep forgetting to call during the day and cancel my subscription to the Tribune.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t report race in the case of black-on-White but do in the rare case of White-on-black, they don&rsquo;t report facts equitably, therefore they are biased and not a reputable source for news.</p>

		<p>The people want to know the weather, so the press gives them weather reports. They want to know traffic conditions, so the press prints traffic reports. They want to know if the large gangs terrorizing the beaches are black, and the media says they don&rsquo;t need to know that. Is there a better example of the &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; function the media has assumed?</p>

When you ask newspapers why they include sex, age, height, clothing (which can be quickly and easily changed), and not race, they won&rsquo;t give you an answer.</p>
<p>The typical answers is &#8216;we only include race when it&rsquo;s relevant to the piece such as a hate crime&rsquo; which doesn&rsquo;t answer the question of why those descriptions are included but not race. </p>
<p>Their reasons are absurd but they cling to their lies. What&rsquo;s just as bad is the number of people who defend the policy on newspaper websites; &#8220;Race doesn&rsquo;t matter, you racist!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just like the dog-biting analogy, &#8220;Black man commits robbery&#8221; isn&rsquo;t news.  &#8220;White man robs black&#8221; IS news.</p>
<p>Funny how real police begin a description with a gender and race &#8220;Suspect is a male Caucasian, about 30 years old&hellip;&#8221; but in journalism, criminals suddenly don&rsquo;t belong to a race anymore.</p>

		<p>Back when I attended the Art Institute of Chicago we would receive weekly e-mailed crime reports. This was in the center of downtown Chicago.</p>
<p>In every single report, every single one, the perpetrator was &#8220;black&#8221; with a hoodie, baggy jeans, mid-20&rsquo;s or so, et cetera. After a few months of this regular and dependable reportage all of the sudden the perpetrators were simply wearing hoodies, baggy jeans, mid-20&rsquo;s or so, et cetera. </p>
<p>It is obvious that some administrator was miffed about this since obviously race is a social construct. </p>
<p>I was puzzled about the administration&rsquo;s failure to protect the overwhelmingly white and out-of-state students who had no experience in the dangers of inner-city crime. Did they just want them to simply get mugged, raped and/or killed? Or did they want to protect the muggers, rapists and murderers from the horrible insult of &#8220;racism&#8221;? </p>
<p>I was amazed. Probably one of my first very profound race realist moments.</p>

		<p>On July 03, the BBC news channel that is often accessible via<br>
NPR outlets, carried a news item that illustrates what is of<br>
concern here.  It was a story that upon reflection seemed actually to omit what likely was truly newsworthy and to weave<br>
a manipulative and suggestive item from mere strands.  The story as made manifest was of a fellow in a seaboard state who had<br>
an extensive history of treatment for mental disorders managing nonetheless to get a Court to restore his rights to gun ownership and possession.  His local prosecuting attorney, a chap who appeared from the quality of his commentary never to have made Law Review in his schooling, gave forth some inane commentary suggesting it was simply ridiculous to let such a person have a gun in America.  What was cookie cut out of the <br>
relevant facts was first of all that across the varied spectrum of mental disorders are many categories of patients who demonstrably have a lower incidence of violence than does the general population.  The &#8220;news&#8221; item made no mention of any actual history of violence on the part of the fellow seeking restoration of gun rights.  It is not a wild conjecture that a person if identified in this sort of story might be a rather mild mannered guy with severe chronic neurosis who was born with, and has retained, some amount of  Bambi complex but lives in a demographic setting  of racial tension and high crime and much violence and a police response time average of as much as 8 or 9 minutes.  Anyone reading Jared Taylor&rsquo;s masterful THE COLOR OF CRIME would have a fundamental sense of what this story is probably really about and how the MSM  story omits about all the facts of life that would make the matter particularly revealing.  Sometimes I think the only profession that can relish the present state of decay in America is that of  the writers for popular  stand up comedians.    </p>

		<p>The media&rsquo;s non-reporting of suspects&rsquo; race, unless white, has resulted in a situation they surely didn&rsquo;t intend  &mdash;  the assumption by the reader that a suspect of unnamed race is black.  Fifty years ago, when the U.S. was well over 80% white, news agencies would note the race of a non-white suspect.  Otherwise, readers would rightly assume he was white.  Of course,  we now have a situation where a majority of crimes ARE  committed by blacks.  Will it ever dawn on the liberal media that readers and listeners are assuming blackness because of this?  <br>
Fortunately, most Americans have long understood that black areas are unsafe.  The new problem is blacks ranging out into white neighborhoods.  In the past, the police would have beaten and even shot such intruders and possibly would have even gone down into the ghettoes to make the message clear.  Now, police leaders talk and act as if they don&rsquo;t know how to react.  Someone can quickly lose his job and entire career if he utters the &#8220;wrong&#8221; word.  Mayors, both black and white, want the black vote and pressure police directors not to anger the ghettoes.  <br>
Whites simply must act for themselves.  Most importantly, we need to see that the President and his racist AG are out of office in 2013.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see what happens by writing a letter to the editor that complains of their &#8220;ageist&#8221; and &#8220;sexist&#8221; reporting, which cast a bad name on all teens and all men, who are not all criminals.</p>

		<p>So what&rsquo;s the agenda, in 2013, if BRA does not go quietly unto that good night?  I&rsquo;m sure there will have to be some response plan as &#8216;united front&rsquo; to the possibility of major black riots and serial hate crimes against whites in areas where it seems that &#8216;racism&rsquo; is responsible for Obama&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>Indeed, I would think that talking about it as though it was -expected- (reelect OR &#8216;you&rsquo;re racist! and we won&rsquo;t be responsible for whatever happens next!&rsquo;) might push that perceived agenda.</p>
<p>Now who knows, maybe poor blacks who commit a lot of crime will be satisfied with four years of &#8216;happy times&rsquo; submarining American society almost untouchably.</p>
<p>But if they are not&hellip;  What then?  It starts to smell like there is in-being an intentionally prosecuted plan to raise racial tensions simply to justify whatever crackdown comes after the &#8216;necessary tragedy&rsquo; reveals a hidden truth.</p>
<p>One of the easiest things to do (now mandatory after Patriot Act II) is to implement biometric ID and RFID via drivers license and state ID cards.  If you want to stop individual perpetrators, one of the best ways of doing so is making them justify their every move in proximity to a given crime.  Everytime you go through a major gateway to a store or government building or transport node.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just for the criminals, right?  And yet it would apply to all of us.</p>
<p>Do not be too happy with this state of &#8216;realization&rsquo; as to how dangerous blacks can be.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be starting to leak out around the edges if it wasn&rsquo;t deliberately intended to be revealed as such.</p>
