<h1>Fans Blame Racism for Lack of Black Managers in England</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, July 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than half the respondents to an online poll of 1,000 soccer fans including current and former players believe racism is the reason for the lack of black managers in English soccer.</p>
<p>The poll was designed and conducted by Ellis Cashmore and Jamie Cleland from Staffordshire University and their conclusions published in the journal &#8220;Ethnic and Racial Studies&#8221; (https://bit.ly/blackmanagers).</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of black and minority ethnic managers in English professional soccer has been stable for nearly 10 years,&#8221; Cashmore and Cleland wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are usually between two and four (out of a possible 92). Yet black players regularly make up more than a quarter of professional club squad.</p>
<p>&#8220;The findings indicate 56 percent of respondents believe racism operates at the executive levels of football, i.e. the boardroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;While some accuse club owners of directors of deliberate discrimination, most suspect a form of unwitting or institutional racism in which assumptions about black people&rsquo;s capacities are not analysed and challenged and continue to circulate.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The authors said soccer had turned into an entertainment industry in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were a circus, black players would be part of its main attraction: like lions perhaps, but rarely lion tamers and never ringmasters,&#8221; they concluded.</p>

		<p>The very same sport in the very same country is disproportionately black in terms of its players, and from what I have seen, the younger in age range you go, the blacker the sport is.  I read a Daily Mail article, accidentally clicking it on my phone when I wanted to read something else, but it was about an Under-21 soccer competition between England and another country   &mdash;   The &#8220;English&#8221; team was almost all black.</p>
<p>Pray tell how can a sport be so &#8220;non-racist&#8221; when it comes to its players and so &#8220;racist&#8221; when it comes to its coaches, simultaneously?</p>
<p>Too, what real difference do soccer coaches make at the professional level?  I would imagine that professional men in their 20s and 30s know the fundamentals, while younger players do benefit from such coaching.  I don&rsquo;t imagine being a professional soccer coach is a very difficult job, at least from an athletic standpoint.  Maybe from a PR standpoint, especially if your team has a lot of blacks, and you have to answer media quizzing about your most recent player arrests.</p>

		<p>Its absolute bilge to cite racism as the reason for the paucity of black managers.There are barely any white englishmen employed in a managerial capacity,and the bulk of the Premier League clubs are owned by foreigners,yet this is not deemed a cause for concern. Many black players,including Viv Anderson,Leroy Rosenior,and Chris Hughton have flourished at management level,and skin colour has proven no barrier to the many black former players now employed as media pundits.The predictable invocation of &#8220;racism&#8221; to explain away a simple lack of interest is reminiscent of the twisted logic used to explain why black people rarely use national parks.  </p>

		<p>Just because a player is good as a player, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that he will be a good manager.<br>
Team owners sign black players because they think they  will help their team win games.<br>
In the same way, if a team owner thinks that a black manager will help their team win, they will hire him.<br>
I know that if I had invested millions of dollars in a team I would hire the best man for the job. Black or white.<br>
Anyway, how many black managers are there in English soccer ?</p>

		<p>Blacks are not 25% of the English population.  Why do they constitute 25% of the professional squads?  Why are white players underrepresented?  Why not investigate the anti-white racism that prevents whites from achieving their proportion on the squad?  If the answer to that question has to do with ability, perhaps that is also the answer to the question of why so few Blacks manage the British clubs.  </p>

		<p>And if they were the &#8220;lion tamers&#8221; and the &#8220;ring masters,&#8221; they&rsquo;d be complaining that they were only a little more than a quarter of the &#8220;lions.&#8221;</p>
<p>And how does the current situation impact the football industry in England? Do the few teams with black managers perform better? Worse? If they do either, is it because they&rsquo;re black? </p>
<p>I doubt the fans will boycott in protest. Knowing what I know about English football fans, I doubt that most really care.  </p>

		<p>English soccer fans are just as bad as American sports fans when it comes to their infatuation with black athletes. I saw thousands of them on HBO last weekend rooting for a black &#8216;Englishman&rsquo; against a white Ukrainian. By contrast, I didn&rsquo;t see any black Klitschko fans anywhere.</p>

		<p>While the media apologizes, in certain neighborhoods in England they celebrate the fact there are no whites, and act to keep their neighborhoods this way. In England.</p>

		<p>The lack of Black managers in English soccer is not racism. Blacks make up only 2% of England&rsquo;s population.</p>

		<p>English football clubs quite often sack their managers after just a few months, due to lack of results.  Its a hard, stressful job, your always under immense pressure to get results.  You&rsquo;re hounded by the press, vilified by your fans, and insulted in the street.  Blacks are generally allegic to any job that puts a bit of pressure on them, so will avoid it like the plague.  No its not down to &#8220;racism&#8221; that there are few black managers in English football.  They just can&rsquo;t be doing with the hassle, man, and don&rsquo;t want to do it.  Simples.  </p>

		<p>Whites had better grow a spine, soon.  When blacks comprise a population of some 2.7 billion by 2060 (NPI video, YouTube), second only to India with 3.2, the overwhelming -crush- of humanity will be such that mass migratory population shifts will drive societies together and any perceived weakness in defending one&rsquo;s own privileges will see the more &#8216;vigorous&rsquo; immigrant populations surge into positions of power that they might not otherwise be skilled enough to own.</p>
<p>The end of Apartheid Africa is the key example here but others, like Zimbabwe, exist.</p>
<p>When England is 20% black, and 40% Asian, it will likely be too late to start rearguing meritocritous standards because the 85 IQs will want what they&rsquo;ve always had.  And they will have the numbers to make refusing them, &#8216;out of fairness&rsquo;, a very difficult proposition.</p>
