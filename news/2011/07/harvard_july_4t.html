<h1>Harvard: July 4th Parades Are Right-Wing</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Bedard, U.S. News, June 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} A new Harvard University study finds that July 4th parades energize only Republicans, turn kids into Republicans, and help to boost the GOP turnout of adults on Election Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth of July celebrations in the United States shape the nation&rsquo;s political landscape by forming beliefs and increasing participation, primarily in favor of the Republican Party,&#8221; said the report from Harvard. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The three key findings of those attending July 4th celebrations:</p>
<p>•	When done before the age of 18, it increases the likelihood of a youth identifying as a Republican by at least 2 percent.</p>
<p>•	It raises the likelihood that parade watchers will vote for a Republican candidate by 4 percent.</p>
<p>•	It boosts the likelihood a reveler will vote by about 1 percent and increases the chances they&rsquo;ll make a political contribution by 3 percent.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the impact isn&rsquo;t fleeting. &#8220;Surprisingly, the estimates show that the impact on political preferences is permanent, with no evidence of the effects depreciating as individuals become older,&#8221; said the Harvard report.</p>
<p>Finally, the report suggests that if people are looking for a super-patriotic July 4th, though should head to Republican towns. &#8220;Republican adults celebrate Fourth of July more intensively in the first place.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Conduct a little experiment.  Drive down ten white streets and then ten black streets.  Count how many flags you see out for the Fourth of July in the white neighborhood versus in the black one.</p>
<p>It seems that not only are patriotism and pride in America considerd passe among young and left-leaning people, but it&rsquo;s considered downright evil and immoral among blacks and Hispanics</p>

		<p> In my American History class, a period is set aside for announcements and the Pledge (and moment of silence). Those who were conservative (and/or Christian) said it with much more gusto than those who I knew were liberal. Every so often, at the end I would say &#8220;I guess we know who the Republicans are!&#8221; Others would stand repectfully though with varying degrees of indifference. <br>
 I am not surprised at the study. <br>
 I teach a traditional view of history with all the White heroes included. In my &#8220;White, bright and polite&#8221; classes it seems to be appreciated. <br>
 Now I have to work at hints of race realism the best I can.</p>

		<p>Sadly I didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to attend Harvard or any other institution of higher learning. I became a Republican all on my own. Now that I am on in years I don&rsquo;t feel I missed out all that much after reading some of the &#8220;news&#8221; and watching our controlled MSM spewing their agenda daily on the readers. Since they conveniently overlook all the black on white crime and only report what makes the others look like &#8220;victims&#8221; I have all but given up on this form of education. Color me Republican !!</p>

		<p>I realize that newser Bedard doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between cause and correlation, but I assume that Harvard social researchers do. Roughly, what corelation means is that certain events are usually occur together, not that one causes the other. It seems reasonable that people who attend patriotic events are patriotic. It was not stated that not attending the events would not make them less patriotic. And I doubt if this would be the case.</p>
<p>What interests me is that why these flag wavers who love traditional America vote for Republican candidates in a general election. The Republicans are as opposed to the America they love as much as the Dems, and are doing as much to destroy it.</p>

		<p>I got disgusted with American politics a few years back and stopped flying the flag at my house. What you notice though is how negatively some of our new residents view the flag. Exhibit &lsquo;A&rsquo; is an educated Central American immigrant complaining to another new immigrant, this one from Sweden. The Central American&rsquo;s complaint is that the Swede had hung a large American flag in the gymnasium that she manages. The Swedish immigrant apologizes to the Central American immigrant and agrees to take down the flag at her gym.</p>
<p>So now I have a new flag. Happy Fourth of July. Enjoy the parade.</p>

		<p>This finding helps to explain why a key Democratic Party power base, the public school system, makes encourages its captive clientele to shed whatever patriotic sentiments they may have absorbed from their parents.</p>
<p>In the words of then nation&rsquo;s premiere education historian Diane Ravitch:  </p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;we&rsquo;ve gone from one extreme to the other. Instead of a simplistic patriotism, we have in our public schools an adversarial culture, a treatment of American history that emphasizes the nation&rsquo;s warts and failings and diminishes its genuine accomplishments. In English classes, there is no literary canon, there is no tradition within which students can situate new authors and new works. Groups like the National Council of the Social Studies periodically express hostility to history as a field of study, worrying that it is by nature conservative, even jingoistic&hellip;.Such an influential organization as the National Council of Teachers of English rejects the idea of a reading list that might recommend certain novels or poems over others, this apparently being an act of literary tyranny from which our teachers and students should be protected.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m not affiliated with either of the parties, I will go Harvard one better. If a person is introduced to our history, it is completely radical. The world had never seen such people before and has never seen the like since as we are. If you&rsquo;re on this site and you believe in our Race and refuse to buy into this new &#8220;culture that&rsquo;s being pushed, most likely, you are an American/Radical as well. </p>
<p>In the end, we&rsquo;ll win out. That&rsquo;s why are enemies are always close to hysteria. They know they&rsquo;re up against excellence, true Americans.</p>
<p>Happy 4th of July and keep the faith.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s their point?  Do they cautiously avoid celebrating the 4th of July, and does that make them feel superior?  What rubbish.  Since when is celebrating a nation&rsquo;s birth wrong for citizens of that nation?  Or is this another sign that it&rsquo;s time to carve us up into new nations, so that the Harvard crowd will have something to celebrate, too?</p>

This Harvard study makes it sound as if Independence Day (July 4th is just a day of the week) celebrations need to be curtailed because they inspire patriotism and encourage people to vote Republican.</p>
<p>Could it be that Republicans experience a uniquely American sense of pride on Independence Day and see it as a common American cultural tradition in which they wish to partake?  </p>
<p>Is this the first step in trying to re-brand Independence Day as a uniquely partisan Republican holiday which needs to be banned? </p>
<p>Actually, as I stated, referring to Independence Day as the 4th of July is in step with redefining and eliminating our cultural history.<br>

		<p>That the relatively homogeneous Republican party be more likely to celebrate the Fourth of July than Democrats, a party increasingly composed of ethnic groups who have either no great connection to the USA and its founding stock or principles or are overtly hostile to the US, should come as no surprise.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why they&rsquo;re so concerned. The 4th of July seems to have turned into &#8216;they&rsquo; holiday where I live. Blacks love to get together and party on the 4th. Certain holidays they seem to have latched onto and made it to suit themselves in one way or the other.  It&rsquo;s not really a patriotic display on their part; it&rsquo;s more like they think it gives them a huge excuse to do whatever they want. </p>

		<p>I recently saw a video of a presentation at Colonial Williamsburg.  Actors dressed in period costume recited the Declaration of Independence, then the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sang a song.  Then the actors, the choir, and the tourists all sang &#8220;Yankee Doodle.&#8221;  It looked like a very nice event.  As I was watching, I noticed that, with the exception of one black actor hired by Colonial Williamsburg, everybody in the video was white.  Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s mainly whites who care about patriotism, American history, the Founding Fathers, Independence Day, etc.  What&rsquo;s going to happen to places like Colonial Williamsburg when whites are a minority?  Will such places be paved over and turned into mini-malls with dollar stores, check-cashing establishments, and fast-food joints? </p>

		<p>I remember I thought patriotism was passe and lame in high school and maybe my first year of college. I thought I was above nationalism like a typically smug liberal. Now I look at this country and find very little to be nationalistic about, other than our rich history. A history filled with real men who did what was best for themselves and their neighbors. Now there is almost nothing to celebrate. An affirmative action president, a media that restricts free thought, and a widening gap between the rich and poor. I wish we had more patriots in the top 1%, this country would not be where it is now.</p>

		<p>I remember a time (not too far back, either) when Democrats were the most patriotic people you could find in America. </p>
<p>They represented the unions and the interests of the American working class. You would know a Democrat because he would drive an American-made pick-up truck with an American flag sticker slapped to the back, next to his union-affiliated sticker. You would see them buying lots of fireworks on the days before the Fourth of July, whole families preparing meals, revelry in the cul-de-sacs and pure, old-fashioned fun! </p>
<p>The Democratic Party turned on it&rsquo;s base of white working-class voters and betrayed them in the 60s and 70s. It went from a party of the middle-class American worker to a party of welfare-dependent blacks and the social workers/educators/liberal do-gooders who were their social engineers. </p>
<p>When that happened, the unions turned on the white working-class too. </p>
<p>Now, the white working class trust neither the Democrats, nor the unions. The Republican Party claims to value the white working class, but it is - at its heart - a corporatist party that cares about Corporate America and the Corporate International Elite. The Republican Party makes noises to the white working class every so often, only so it can keep their loyalty, but the Republican Party is just as anti-white as the new Democratic Party is (think of all of the &#8220;diversity&#8221; garbage they spew), and worse, the Republicans also hate the working class. </p>

		<p>Here in SoCA, in Hispanic neighborhoods you see the Mexican flag, not the American flag, and they celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  On the 4th of July they shoot guns into the air and the falling bullets kill innocent people.  So much for patriotism in the barrio!!  Of course the blacks shoot off their guns too, with no flags in sight - but there are bedsheets on the windows.  None of these people are smart enough to figure out that what goes up must come down&hellip;</p>

<p>I was thinking&hellip; how about some more research, along the lines of Harvard University&rsquo;s affect on students, and whether it pushes them left or right. That might be too much research, though. And be politically motivated. But goodness knows television sells a leftist agenda. Make that magazines, newspapers, movies and music too.  </p>

		<p>This Harvard &#8220;Professor&#8221; is only attacking the 4th of July because it&rsquo;s cultural roots are White. His anti-Independence Day sentiments are a thinly veiled expression of his anti-White sentiments.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see Mexicans insinuating that Cinco de Mayo is a subversive, racist holiday that&rsquo;s woefully out of step w/ the modern progressive zeitgeist, do you? - Answer: No&hellip; Never. Not even once.</p>
<p>Then ask that &#8220;Professor&#8221; what only a couple of hours per day of the omnipresent mainstream &#8220;progressive&#8221; media inculcates into the minds of the American viewing public (especially those under 18) and you&rsquo;ll get, at best, &#8220;Ummmm&#8221;s and &#8220;Aww&#8221;s; at worst you&rsquo;ll be called an &#8220;anti-semite&#8221; or a &#8220;racist&#8221; and possibly have your livelihood threatened.<br>

		<p>Now the liberals feel threatened by July 4th parades. How totally pathetic is that? I wonder how much this so called &#8220;STUDY&#8221; cost the American tax-payer?  Maybe Harvard University will simply raise their tuition to pay for it all. Looks like the Democrats are totally paranoid and panicked by the 2012 election.     </p>

		<p>At no time in its history has the Republican party ever championed the rights of white people.</p>
<p>Let me say that again, for those of you who are a little slow.  Although the Democratic party is currently in the grips of communists who want to kill all whites, at no time in its history has the Republican party EVER fought against that agenda.  Today, they won&rsquo;t even speak of it because they know that would be demanded of them.  Instead, they &#8220;imply&#8221; it by being the other party.  Problem is, their behavior never, and never has, matched that implication.</p>
<p>In the past, it was the DEMOCRATIC party that was the party of the K, Jim Crow, and the Confederacy, when you go back far enough.</p>
<p>Who is to blame that they gave that up?  Look in the mirror if you stupidly vote republican.  Republicans hammered at them in the name of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; until they found a weakness (corruption in the K) and then used it to smash the party to pieces. My point is the Republicans have always been anti-white.</p>
<p>The best that can be said about the Republicans is they believe (and this has been decreasing rapidly over the years) in white values.  However, they want non-whites to hold those values while white people die.</p>
<p>We are two generations past any reasonable political solution to white genocide.  In a few weeks, open race war will be a reality.  Blacks and Mexicans are already targeting white neighborhoods for random mob violence.  Only a matter of time before they go from a few hundred tearing up a store and killing only a couple of whites (oh yeah, the media is forgetting to mention all the whites that have been killed this summer) to an army of several thousand trying to burn a town or two to the ground.</p>
<p>You will fight.  Make no mistake.  No one will fight for you.  No cops will show up.  Certainly, no military will show.</p>
<p>This summer seems to me very much a test run for organized violence they plan to bring to us.  What do they want?  As crazy as it sounds they want a black run dictatorship like what&rsquo;s in Zimbabwe and they think they can use violence to bring it about.  They are completely delusional.  But what are YOU going to do if they do this and Obama claims that, in order to restore &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in this country he needs to &#8220;temporarily&#8221; suspend elections and become a dictator.</p>
<p>Not going to happen?  Every single thing he&rsquo;s done since elected points towards his trying to do this very thing.  Glenn Beck might be a stooge, but he&rsquo;s done a good job documenting this very thing when no one else has bothered to notice.  Obama has installed a vestigial second government loyal only to him and the crazier ideals of the left.  At a signal, they could take over.  Why are they there?</p>
<p>You better be ready.  Ready means you better own guns.  You better not live near concentrations of non-whites.  You better have a reasonable stock of gasoline, food and water to handle a temporary suspension of services.  Think Katrina.  If Katrina were to happen where you live, would you have enough stuff to wait it out a few weeks.  Could you repel a group of 3 or 4 men trying to kick down your door?  Do you live in a place like New Orleans?</p>
<p>If your situation is like what happened to the whites in New Orleans who went to the Superdome to be caged in with thousands who wanted to rape, rob and murder them, you have about a year to fix that.  After that&hellip;.</p>

		<p>There is something quite ominous about the fact that anti-Americanism and anti-patriotism (for the US) is so prevalent on college campuses and has been so for over 30 years.   What&rsquo;s worse, is that the most elite schools are the ones who treat love of country (for the US) as more of a joke than any other academic environment.  </p>
<p>This is important because of who runs our country from virtually the top down to the lowest levels of management in both the public and private bureaucracies?&hellip; College graduates.  Who runs banks and corporations?&hellip;  Who runs the branches of government?&hellip; Who is on corporate boards?&hellip;  Usually college graduates, and, more often than not, elite university college graduates, people who spent their entire youth in environments that considered love of the US to be a fool&rsquo;s errand, people who think that many Americans are &#8220;bitter clingers&#8221; and &#8220;teabaggers&#8221; or merely helpless and useless other than for votes.   And many mid-level government bureaucrats are college graduates who had to be steeped in their own version of &#8220;The US is a evil country&#8221; mindset in order to get where they are professionally.   Even people who reject such things consciously often fall into the behavior unconsciously.</p>
<p>Now think about this in terms of a leadership situation in the US when some high ranking executive or government big shot must make a decision that would benefit them personally but screw over thousands if not millions of Americans?&hellip;  Wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard a decision for them if they had been taught a long time ago that the US isn&rsquo;t a good place and most of the people in it are bad people&hellip; &#8220;low sloping forehead people from the middle regions&#8221; as a NYT columnist recently put it on the Bill Mahar Show.    Not only do they probably not feel that pad when they make decisions that hurt Americans, they might even feel good about it.  </p>
<p>This is the big difference between the US now and the US 50 years ago.   Fifty years ago, I suspect that most of our leaders were still patriots.  Now, I think most of the leaders in the US, both public and private, have been trained their entire lives to not be patriots.  In fact, I think they&rsquo;ve been trained most, if not all of their lives, to not consider a US citizen any more important than any other citizen.  Some, even think US citizens, especially white ones are things to be reviled and hated, even if they feel so often on an unconscious level.   It does leak out though when you listen to some of the statements the power elite make from time to time.  it definitely leaks out when you see the laws and policies they make in action.   </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Republican adults celebrate Fourth of July more intensively in the first place.&rdquo;<br>
..should read,&#8221;Whites celebrate Fourth of July more intensively than any other minority in the first place.&#8221;..Related History&hellip;..During the War of 1812,the British ranks included approximately three hundred armed American blacks, who were used in combat against American forces.  Some of these blacks helped the British burn the White House in 1814 (Roediger,p.44)&hellip;No wonder that Frederic Douglas would declare to a White audience on Independence Day, nine years before the Civil War, &#8220;This Fourth of July is yours,not mine.&#8221;  The British aristocracy&rsquo;s penchant for arming blacks and Indians for combat against White Americans has largely been forgotten today,even though it was one of the factors which led the colonists to go to war against King George, and was cited as such in the Declaration of Independence.  The patriot&rsquo;s outrage at Indian atrocities and anger at Dunmore&rsquo;s manumission of black was summarized by Jefferson in one of the least quoted passages of the Declaration: &#8220;He(King George)has excited domestic insurrections amongst us (Dunmore&rsquo;s proclamation freeing Blacks in American jurisdiction), and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.&#8221; Happy July Fourth!!!!</p>

		<p>#20 Anonymous sums it up quite well as regards the state of our major political parties.  <br>
Nonetheless, I believe it&rsquo;s important that we vote for politicians who are credibly anti-illegal-immigration, even if we have to choose the lesser of two evils.  If we can put together a viable third party, that&rsquo;s great, but we have to be careful about splitting conservative votes and putting Obama in for a second term.  If our country falls to the control of third-worlders, the U.S.A. is as good as done.  That&rsquo;s obviously what leftist Dems want if they&rsquo;re against patriotism.  <br>
I&rsquo;m sure many of AmRen commenters have read White Identity, but if you haven&rsquo;t, do so, by all means!  If you in any way underestimated the danger of non-white immigrants, you&rsquo;ll be set straight after reading Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s enlightening book.  </p>

		<p>That was gracious of the left to finally confirm that it no longer identifies with America or as Americans. We knew this already, but still, it&rsquo;s nice that they&rsquo;re being honest about something for a change. I seem to remember standard op for leftists/proggies was to deny accusations they lacked nationalism/patriotism.  Which says how much further they&rsquo;ve strayed since, that they can admit such things now and not even bat an eye. </p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re not celebrating the Fourth of July, are they mourning it instead?  Stewing in their &#8220;Goddamn that America&#8221; broth while the rest of us are watching fireworks?</p>

		<p>Commie radio station KPFA here in Berkeley has begun its annual 4th of July hate-fest against the genocidal United States, beginning with an impassioned excoriation of the 4th of July by Frederick Douglass..some American Indian is on at the moment saying that the local indian shell mounds are our Stonehenge and should be preserved. The best the local indians could leave us was their garbage dumps, which we should preserve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in favor of preserving one or two, just because the indians who inhabited this bountiful area of easy living were apparently a pleasant bunch with a happy lifestyle, and it would be nice to have some tangible memory of them. But let&rsquo;s not get all puffed up about it&hellip;.for better or worse, they have little to do with us. There&rsquo;s no way we can really even know much about their culture&hellip;as I recall Malcolm Margolin&rsquo;s &#8220;The Ohlone Way,&#8221; it&rsquo;s mostly reasonable speculation. Which is a shame from the perspective of history and anthropology and probably psychology, but that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>Happy 4th of July! But I&rsquo;m afraid I feel more like mourning, considering the present state of the Union.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;ve read the Harvard Study you will note that the authors might well be foreigners. The authors were Andreas Madestam† and David Yanagizawa-Drott. Good American sounding names are they not?</p>
<p>Harvard is, has, and (maybe it always has been) an academy for cultural Marxists (in my time we would have called them communists and simply been done with it). Take for example the CNN commentator Fareed Zacharia who is a Muslim from India and received a BA from Yale and a PHD from Harvard. He is currently calling for a revision of the US Constitution to reflect the current trends in left wing multicultural values. Of course we all know what that really means. </p>

		<p> It seems like the controlled media is trying to turn our traditional Independence Day into Third World &#8220;Immigration&#8221; Day. Most news reports make a sacred ritual out of the swearing in of new citizens on the Fourth. Liberty or our founders&rsquo; fight for freedom is totally ignored; instead, we must celebrate diversity through immigration. Most of these televised citizenship ceremonies show a huge mass of brown, black and yellow faces, with barely a white among them. </p>

		<p>The Republicans are responsible for the Civil Rights Act. They LOVE MLK. They LOVE desegregation. They LOVE the 1965 Immigration Act. They love ALL different races in our country and think it is great. Just ask any &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show host what they think of what I mentioned above. They will trip all over themselves explaining how it was the Republicans that were all responsible for all this diversity being shoved down our throats and they think it is a &#8220;good&#8221; thing. Real morons, they are.</p>
<p>That is why I will never vote for a Republican again and I have never voted Democrat and never will. I will vote for a WHITE Party if we are ever allowed that freedom to even have one. So, I guess my vote will never happen.</p>
