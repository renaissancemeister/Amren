<h1>Documents Confirm Obama Administration&rsquo;s &#8216;Catch and Release&rsquo; Immigration Policy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Hollingsworth, Washington Examiner, July 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Well, what do you know. Obama administration officials at the Department of Homeland Security deliberately misled Congress when they denied using &#8220;selective enforcement&#8221; to deport convicted criminals in the U.S. illegally. Their much-criticized &#8220;catch and release&#8221; policy was confirmed by documents obtained by Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>The documents &#8220;show that the Obama administration is implementing &#8216;stealth amnesty&rsquo; which is an end-run around the rule of law and Congress,&#8221; said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton.</p>
<p>Contrary to administration claims that convicted criminals were being deported just as fast as DHS got them, the released documents show that local immigration officials were in fact being given what Judicial Watch describes as &#8220;wide latitude&#8221; to dismiss federal immigration charges  &mdash;  even against criminals convicted of violent crimes such as sexual assault, solicitation of murder, kidnapping, aggravated assault, drug possession and assaulting a police officer.</p>
<p>They were then released back into the same American communities they violated, where they were free to prey on new victims. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another example: ICE officials in Pennsylvania advised police to release three illegal immigrants charged with speeding, driving without a license, insurance or registration under false identification. </p>
<p>This is strikingly similar to ICE&rsquo;s refusal to deport Carlos Martinelly-Montano, who was subsequently charged with killing one nun and critically injuring two others last August in Prince William County in a drunk driving accident. Martinelly-Montano was allowed to remain in the U.S. despite two previous DUI convictions.</p>

		<p>Catch and release?  I can grok the release part, but it seems to me they&rsquo;re not even bothering to &#8220;catch&#8221; them.</p>

		<p>A frightened population is a malleable one.<br>
All sorts of rules/restrictions can be imposed on a malleable population. It is of course better to disarm them first. Watch for new and improved laws on that subject.</p>

		<p>Amnesty by fiat!Obama is courting the Hispanic vote for the 2012 election. You only have to look at his declining poll ratings to understand why he is trying to offset them by pandering to the leaders of the Mexican amnesty groups.   A case in point, Obama just gave Cecilia Munoz, La Raza&rsquo;s former senior vice president, a cushy hack job as director of &#8220;International Affairs.&#8221;   Obama understands that Latino voters are very personally engaged and watching carefully what is happening with the immigration policies because they know people who will be impacted by said policies. </p>

<p>I agree, I&rsquo;m surprised out how well American Police catch black criminals. I often wonder how long it can go on before it gets to the point where. There&rsquo;s simply not enough good white police left to catch all these third-world criminals</p>

		<p>The documents &ldquo;show that the Obama administration is implementing &lsquo;stealth amnesty&rsquo; which is an end-run around the rule of law and Congress,&rdquo; said Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton.</p>
<p>This is actually quite a humorous statement&hellip;.especially coming from Judicial Watch.  That group exists, specifically to document the fact that there IS NO RULE OF LAW in the United States.  And hasn&rsquo;t been for some time now.  We have laws.  But the laws are all but ignored by an unelected, unaccountable oligarchy of &#8220;judges&#8221; and bureaucrats.  Increasingly, our &#8220;president&#8221; rules as a dictator.  He certainly kills innocent people in pointless wars, like a dictator&hellip;.and laughs in the face of anyone who points out he has no legal right to take us into such wars.</p>
<p>Amnesty by executive order is only the latest, tiny piece of our immigration &#8220;laws&#8221; being used as toilet paper.</p>
<p>The United States is a third world, communist, banana republic, wrapped around the rotting remains of a first world democracy.  The real question is if that democracy is willing to go to war, to throw off that parasitic entity.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, the REAL question is how that democracy will react when that parasitic entity declares war on us, as it starts to collapse&hellip;.as it has become clear will happen this year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real meaning of those mob attacks by blacks on whites.  Literally, they believe that the time to take over is now.  They plan this upcoming &#8220;election&#8221; to be the transition of Obama from president to dictator for life.  And they plan to use violence to make it happen.</p>
<p>How will whites react.  Best case scenario.  Civil war followed by virulent white nationalist takeover and ethnic cleansing of non-whites from the continental US.  Worst case scenario&hellip;.acceptance, zimbabwe/south african style (shameful) followed by genocide against us.  Most likely scenario.  A soviet style breakup of the US followed by balkanization&hellip;.the result of which determined by the resulting ethnostate&rsquo;s willingness to procreate and self-determine.  In other words, a second chance for whites to assert a healthy racial identity and retake our lands in a future generation&hellip;..if we take it.</p>

		<p>I find this story anti-climatic. Don&rsquo;t Americans realize that this strategy has been used by the past, oh, I&rsquo;d say five administrations. </p>
