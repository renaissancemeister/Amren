		<p>The big problem with the entire argument is that white SUPREMACY is the highest form of good in the world and a goal every white person should strive for.  It literally IS civilization itself&hellip;.no other race having contributed meaningfully to the creation of the modern world in any way.  Most of what we call morality is nothing more than white culture made the law of the land, throughout the world&hellip;..almost 100% of the time displacing heinous evil non-whites were engaged in before white supremacy forced them to stop.</p>
<p>At the heart of white genocide is the giving up of white supremacy.  Multi-culturalism is nothing less than the institutionalized tolerance of evil.  Any white man who denies white supremacy has done nothing less than bow down and accept that tolerance of evil.</p>
<p>On some level, all the people&rsquo;s of the world understand this and yearn for white supremacy.  White supremacy, in real world terms means freedom, plenty, justice and security for all races.  The opposite is also true.  Wherever white supremacy flags, that part of the world becomes a very dark place indeed.</p>
<p>White people need to figure this out.  Need to get comfortable wielding the iron rod of justice once more.  This stuff of the more bitter elements of white nationalism wanting to isolate and wash their hands of the rest of the world (in which they expect almost all non-whites to eventually die off without whites feeding them) is just not realistic.  As for those white nationalists who cravenly avoid the label of racist&hellip;.all I can say is you have far more to fear in this world than a few nasty words hurled your way.</p>

		<p>I would rather subsist in segregated austerity than rut in multicultural opulence.  Is it &#8220;racist&#8221; to venerate the history of one&rsquo;s ancestors for two millennia?  No, it is an act of homage and has nothing to do with supremacy or IQ.  If a bigger brain were journey&rsquo;s end, Anthony &#8220;I did not have sex with that modem&#8221; Weiner would sit atop creation&rsquo;s summit.  It takes more than smarts.  In the last presidential election campaign, one &#8220;journalist&#8221; asked candidate Obama, &#8220;When did you learn to love?&#8221;  (Editor, this is a fact.  I am not making it up.)  Is it wrong for us to love our own again?</p>

		<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say or how you say it, but as long as you are saying that Whites have no legitimate communal, ethnic, or racial interests of self-awareness and self-preservation, you will be on the winning team and be given another humanitarian award, check included.</p>
<p>You are allowed and encouraged to force them to think of themselves as an oppressor who marginalized the angels of lightness and wisdom from the fens of Afrique, and when they act as a group, they can only be atoning for the sins of segregation by holding themselves accountable to the beloved community of color for their unearned White privileges.</p>
<p>There is a panic soon to set in.  Whites will begin to wake up to the consequences of being a minority who is hated by everybody else and is told to hate themselves.</p>
<p>Our first goal should be to make plans for throwing the liberal White elites over the barricades to the joys of their diversity pets.  Now White privilege for those who betray us!<br>

		<p>Dean Malick is a Pakistani &#8220;American&#8221; married to another Pakistatni &#8220;American&#8221;. They have started a Pakistani &#8220;American&#8221; geneline. And this Pakistani &#8220;American&#8221; demands that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide within the borders of America because it would make millions of post-1965 non-whites very happy. The Pakistani Malik argues that it is highly  un-American of Native Born White Americans to resist race-replacement at the hands of post-1965  high fertility non-whites-such as Pakistanis. Dean Malick is declaring a race war against  Native Born White Americans. No one should have any doubt about this-including Charles Bloch and Peter Brimelow.</p>
<p>Once you engage the Pakistatni invader Dean Malik(Mughal-Persian name), you accept race-replacement as a valid debating point. We reject race-replacement of our people at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites such as Dean Malik. There will be no debate about race-replacement.</p>
<p>Since the Pakistani Malick views growing Native Born White American  resistance to race-replacement as unpatriotic and therefore treasonous, and since Native Born White American resistance to race-replacement is going to grow exponentially in the near future, one can conclude that the Pakistani Malik does not recognize millions of Native Born White Americans as Americans.</p>
<p>I do not recognize the Pakistani Dean Malik, his Pakistani wife and Pakistani geneline as Americans.</p>
<p>One last point. There are 0 reasons for Native Born White Americans to accept race-replacement&hellip;and the Pakistatani Malik knows this. So what he is doing is attempting to make a proposition nation-constitutional mandated case for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority.  But behind this abstract proposition nation-constitutional divine edict for race-repacement is a highly racialized Pakistani nationalist agenda. When Native Born White Americans are replaced across &#8220;America&#8221;, Pakistani &#8220;Americans,.Hindu &#8220;Americans&#8221;, Korean &#8220;Americans,Chinese &#8220;Americans&#8221; and Sihk &#8220;Americans&#8221; will make certain that Native Born White American race-replacement is a permanent state of affairs in the new &#8220;America&#8221;&hellip;and there will be no pretense about the real motives for doing this&hellip;it will justified for highly racialized reasons.</p>

		<p>The basis of America&rsquo;s historic Exceptionalism has been a population consisting largely of Talented and Virtuous people of common European descent, living together with abundant land, food, energy, and other natural resources.  The idea of self-governance contained in our Founding Documents is a consequence of these things.</p>
<p>The basis of Mexico&rsquo;s political system is the land and people of Mexico. The basis of the Pakistani political system is the land and people of Pakistan. The basis of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s political system is sub-Saharan Africa. The day is coming where we will have to choose between American Exceptionalism and this self-serving disingenuous idealism being sold to us by this Malik guy from Pakistan.</p>

		<p>Dean Maliks confusion can be cleared up in a fast and simple fashion. Namely by purchasing Mr. Malik a plane ticket to<br>
 South America. There are two English White majority<br>
countries in the Western Hemisphere. There are 22 Latin<br>
American countries whose population is non European, non English,<br>
non White.<br>
Mr. Malik can notice that almost all the non European non white<br>
countries function about the same. The same corruption, chaos,<br>
torpor, hopelessness. In fact Mr. Malik is invited to notice that<br>
the degree of success in any of these countries is directly proportional to the percentage of whites that live in each.<br>
Taking Argentina as an example we can point out to Mr. Malik that in the 1940s Argentia was the 5th most prosperous country in the world.<br>
Today it is #41. What happened? Juan Peron destroyed the Italian/German/English ruling class via a populist movement.<br>
Whites leave&hellip;country declines. Mr. Malik can then notice that Chile retains its European heritage and is successful..but <br>
Bolivia,Peru and Eduador are largely Indio, and hopless failures despite enormous resources. Costa Rica has a European ruling class with modest prosperity while Nicaraqua, Guatemala, and Honduras are failures&hellip;DIRECTLY IN PROPORTION to the white-no white ratio of the country. <br>
Real change comes when we go from South America to North America.<br>
Here we have two largely white countries, USA and Canada that are economic successes..in direct proportion to the degree each has retained<br>
its white European population base and heritage.<br>
SO THE QUESTION IS..WHAT IS THIS &#8220;AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM&#8221; MALIK IS PROUD OF?  I invite him to tell us how that exceptionalism<br>
is not the the result of WHITE RULE..exactly as  is the case in<br>
Argentina, Chile, and Costa Rica. And once he has defined that <br>
&#8220;exceptionalism&#8221; as non racial in basis..how is the USA going to escape the fate of Venezuela, Cuba, South Africa or Zimbabwe.</p>

		<p>I can see why most people with modern sensitivities see the defence of race as a low and reprehensible cause. <br>
We took for granted the positive effects of our own homogenous grouping prior to 1965, which is roughly the year when most Western nations &lsquo;coincidentally&rsquo; instigated broad sweeping immigration reforms.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;..&rdquo;God made the ocean, but the Dutch made Holland. (Quote by - Dutch proverb)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now <b>if you&rsquo;re White, choosing the alternative to being &lsquo;racial aware&rsquo; is equally reprehensive</b> and akin to voluntarily embracing genocide.</p>
<p>I see my White nationalistic feelings as having a similar functionality as a safety valve or fuse. <br>
When the demographic ratios were 90/10 (White/non white) I think there was no doubt less reason for alarm, now that it&rsquo;s 65/35 &ldquo;danger Will Robertson danger&rdquo;!! <br>
You just have to plot the points on the graph between then and now to see the negative gradient from a White POV and the direction we&rsquo;re heading towards.</p>
<p>To me those who defend multiculturalism were either outside the original ethno culture in the first place or who&rsquo;re still living in an idealistic (failed) vision from the past.<br>
As now &lsquo;the horse has already bolted from the stable&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re nearly fifty years into this experiment, and we have enough data now to be able to make a determination on whether this Omni-culture has worked or has failed.</p>
<p>And as with the melting pot plan, who really are the supremacists and the so called &ldquo;haters&rdquo;, as when advocating White+non white parings:<br>
-you&rsquo;re either saying that you &lsquo;hate&rsquo; Whites in wanting to see our uniquely &lsquo;superior&rsquo; qualities (and group identity) diluted.<br>
-or that you &lsquo;hate&rsquo; non whites inherently negative tendencies (such as Asians are too much collective conformists and followers, as are Africans too egoistical and hardwired for instant gratification) which can only be tempered by an influx of &lsquo;superior&rsquo; White genes.  </p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t we all just be left alone with our inherent inferiorities left intact!!<br>

<p>I read some time ago from an anti-genocide organization (which is monitoring the coming genocide against South African whites), that using government or quasi-government force to do just that, deny a given group of people their rights to organize in a communal sense of self-awareness and self-preservation, is an early stage of genocide.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. I had no idea that Malik was a Pakistani. The very fact that this man is Pakistani completely<br>
invalidates his argument. He is looking out for one thing..himself and his Pakistani culture. The only way he can do this is to redefine America..to suit his power grab. Let no one fool himself.<br>
Mr. Malik is the very reason why MultiCulturalism really means<br>
white genocide.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know Dean&rsquo;s background but I can guess from his picture. So let me cut through the baloney and lay it on the line. Dean Malik opposes white nationalism because he&rsquo;s not white. It has nothing to do with history or reality or anything else. It simply suits his interests to oppose white nationalism and this is his way of doing it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll take a blood and soil state over exceptionalism any day.  One is real and enduring, the other a fantasy.  The exceptionalism trope has become a red flag for me, as it has been used to drive the idea that America can&rsquo;t/shouldn&rsquo;t stake any claim to be rooted in an ethnic identity.</p>

American Renaissance should not be considered a White Nationalist website.<br>
American Renaissance is an educational and scientific news and comment forum designed to educate whites about the subject of race and raise awareness of non-white crimes against whites while influencing our race to appreciate ourselves in order to prevent interacial relationships which would lead to race mixing.<br>
White Nationalists promote constitutional laws as well as the importance of the homogenity of race for whites.<br>
Similarly, White Nationalists should not be clumped togeather with National Socialists as Nazi groups are leftist leaning and fall in line with Communists, Socialists, and Fascists of past and present day Europe.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not enamored of the term &#8220;white nationalist&#8221;, as it often is used to describe the Jew hating, Hitler loving marginal people you can find at some of those other web sites.  But unfortunately there is no positive term for advocates for the white race.  If Jared Taylor were any other race he&rsquo;d be called a civil rights leader.  Needless to say, the Founding Fathers were all white nationalists by today&rsquo;s standards.  They thought they were creating a country for white people like themselves, and their posterity.  </p>

		<p>I have a theory: when the Senator from Arizona was shot, the MSM associated her assailant with American Renaissance. Obviously, numerous inquisitive minds searched out the site to find out all the fuss. Hence, after reading articles and responses they realized people here weren&rsquo;t a bunch of wacked-out un-educated hillbillies. It was a moment of truth. I rarely comment because (as my late father used to say)never duel with an unarmed man. And I am that unarmed man, ie lacking in education and slow to absorb information. But I shall continue to read and enjoy. Keep up the good works.<br>

		<p>Allow me to congratulate &#8220;Jupiter&#8221; on one incredibly outstanding posted comment.  </p>
<p>This Dean Malik Pakistani fellow is not unusual in his opinion about forcing whites to accept race replacement and dispossession inside their own native homelands.  Fareed Zakaria wrote an article recently (http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/03/could-america-go-the-way-of-greece/#comment-61071) where he was also spouting that same sort of propositional nation bull manure.   </p>
<p>Whenever I see this kind of garbage, I think to myself:  What gall, what an obnoxious, self-serving, egotistical, conceited, arrogant JERK.   And, I always wonder - where did these non-European aliens ever get the idea that the United States of America wasn&rsquo;t owned by anybody and there isn&rsquo;t the name of White European people on the deed to this nation?    </p>
<p>These people seem to view North America like one big, global &#8216;Homestead Act&rsquo; for the refuse of the Third World.  Well, it&rsquo;s up to Whites in this nation to put an attitude adjustment on these kinds of obnoxious real estate thieves.<br>

The neos, Francis observed, like &#8220;America&#8221; precisely and mostly because of the wonderful things it has done for third-world immigrants such as themselves or their parents.

<p>Thanks for the compliment.</p>
<p>For the past four years on AR and other websites,  I have been making on simple point over and over again and it is this:if Native Born White American racial interests do not completly define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221; to the complete exclusion of the racial interests of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites, it will be impossible to reverse race-replacement. Another point I  have been making over and over again is this:when you toss in the environmental-ecological dimension to the race-replacement issue, the evolving situation for Native Born White Americans is far worse than anybody realizes. If millions of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites are not expelled out of America over time, there will be massive ecological collapse in &#8220;America&#8221;. And with this ecological collapse, what&rsquo;s left of the Native Born White American population will collapse also&hellip;it will be lights out for White America&hellip;forever. Just take a look at the front page of this past Sundays NYT. There is a catastrophic drought in Texas,Arizona and Georgia..three states with exploding post-1965 nonwhite populations. Lakes,creeks and streams are drying up in these states.</p>
<p>So there is obviously a whole lot on the line for Native Born White Americans. And I just wish vdare.com would just state the obvious about the Pakastani Malik:he is declaring a genocidal race war against the Native Born White American Majority.</p>
<p>Racial separatism ultimately means tolerating a very large high-fertility post-1965 nonwhite population within the borders of America. Anyone who thinks that Native Born White Americans are long term viable under this arrangement is being very naive..that&rsquo;s all there is to it. This is why I identify myself as a Native Born White American Patriot. And when you think about it, this bascically what a White Nationalist really is. </p>
<p>With 100 percent certainty, the Pakistani Malik, his Pakistani wife, his Pakistani geneline, and his fellow Pakistani &#8220;Americans,&#8221; harbor very malignant intentions towards the Native Born White American Majority. And this is exactly what Native Born White American Racial Patriots should be saying in public.</p>

		<p>Dean Malik isn&rsquo;t white, and his comments and opinions are coming from the perspective of an expatriate Pakistani-Iranian living extra-territorially in the West.</p>
<p>His self-serving agenda is to shape the definition of &#8216;American&rsquo; to include him and his offspring.</p>

		<p>Since about 1955 the United States of America has been on an anti White rampage.  Our children were and still are attacked every day by blacks bussed in by court order.  Our women are raped as the state schools require every child to read &#8220;To kill a Mockingbird&#8221;, a propaganda piece that claims that White women are such sluts they will drag a virile wonderful black man off the street to copulate.</p>
<p>Our media, government and universities are on an anti White campaign comparable to Martin Luther&rsquo;s campaign against Catholics, Stalin&rsquo;s campaign against kulaks and anyone who got in his way, and Hitler&rsquo;s campaign against Jews.</p>
<p>The campaign is:</p>
<p>(1) Hooliganism or allowing the blacks to attack and murder Whites without punishment as Hitler sent mobs against Jews before he was even elected.</p>
<p>(2) Denial of government jobs an example is the fact that from 1533 to 1832 the English government forbade the employment of Catholics in government jobs and contracting.  Communists and fascists follow the same program, only party members can work for government.</p>
<p>(3) Blaming the vilified group for all the wrongs and problems of the world.  Hitler blamed Jews for every problem in Europe.  Castro and the Russians blame &#8220;subversive elements&#8221; I.E non communists for 70 years of economic failure.</p>
<p>(4) Universities, schools, religious organizations and all media spewing hatred of the vilified group.  In America currently it is Whites.</p>
<p>(5) Sooner or later the vilification of the scapegoat group (Whites) turns to finding solutions to the problem of these evil subversives.</p>
<p>Sometime during this century our government will start exterminating us.  Take a look at TSA.  I travel a lot and I have never, never seen a White TSA worker.  Usually the ACLU, ADL and other radical anti White organizations are madly filing lawsuits and carrying on a propaganda campaign against TSA type law enforcement.</p>
<p>Now that law enforcement has become just another no Whites need apply government job, they are ready to exterminate us. </p>
<p>So why should Whites be patriotic?</p>

		<p>I totally agree that White nationalism is not American patriotism.  </p>
<p>Because of affirmative action banning me from employment, black on White crime and the hatred directed at me and mine by the government, universities and media, I feel about America about the same way the 19th century Irish immigrants felt about the English occupiers, the same way the Florida Cubans feel about Castro, the same way Jews feel about Hitler, the same way any dispossessed people feel about those who have dispossessed them</p>
<p>America is the enemy of Whites. America is well into a program to exterminate us. Why should Whites be patriotic?<br>

		<p>&#8220;Malik [email him] makes several arguments trying to prove that &ldquo;white nationalists&rdquo; are not American patriots.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am a proud White nationalist and definitely not an American patriot.  I feel about America about the same way 1930&rsquo;s Ukranian kulaks felt about Stalin and his troops.</p>
<p>I read freerepublic.com often.  It posts American Thinker pieces daily.  Mawkish, sentimental 3rd grade level nonsense.  It&rsquo;s hard to get through an American Thinker piece without gagging on the sacharine patriotism.</p>

		<p>Thanks for clearing up his ethnicity.  I always thought Malik was an Arab name common in Egypt.  I knew as soon as i saw his name that he was not a real American.</p>
<p>American Thinker is one of those controlled opposition groups like Tea Party, Fox news etc. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Anonymous - post 25&#8221;  I agree completely with you sir! American patriotism is nothing I&rsquo;m terribly concerned with. America has made itself an ENEMY to my people - it is hostile, by official policy, stance, and attitude to the White race, and thus, is nothing I am interested in aligning myself with. And even in an unofficial capacity, our society is anti-White as well - business, entertainment, media&hellip;all nakedly anti-White, and much of the population are just fine with this!</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t something that just popped-up in the Obama, Clinton or even Kennedy years - this country has been sliding into the globalist morass for decades and decades!  </p>
<p>Being patriotic toward a nation that is actively agitating against you is foolish! And pining away for an America that died several generations ago is equally unproductive, if not delusional. </p>
<p>All of this, of course, a Dean Malik cannot understand. Sadly, many Whites who should know better don&rsquo;t really understand it either. </p>

<p>So true, Margaret.  I did not put out the American Flag this July 4th. The first time that I didn&rsquo;t have the &#8220;want to&#8221;. I do not feel patriotic at all any longer since this country has come to bash Whites and invited in millions of nonwhites to silence us even more. The &#8220;conservative&#8221; talking heads keep saying &#8220;we are the patriots&#8221; and I often wondered WHY they keep pushing it in today&rsquo;s America. Don&rsquo;t they have eyes or ears? Or are they just scared little sheep who jump at their master&rsquo;s command?</p>
<p>America was only America when it was WHITE. It no longer is,(at least REAL Whites) so it is not MY America.  </p>

		<p>Margaret, did Martin Luther ever kill a single Catholic or call for their demise? I think you give a very bad comparison by including him with the likes of Stalin and Hitler.</p>

<p>This is a true enough statement, but it appears to me that Miss Margaret is deficient in her knowledge of the topic of The Frankfurt School of Cultural Marxism and who it&rsquo;s founders and originators were, and what their openly stated objectives were with regards to waging a full scale cultural war on the White Western European majorities in America and around the world in every other historic European nation.  </p>
<p>Here is a hint:   The Frankfurt School was originally started in pre-Nazi Germany and when Hitler came to power, these subversives quickly skedaddled to America, and set up shop, I think, at Columbia University and what they had planned to do to Germany, they have done to America.  Additional research on The Frankfurt School is up to you.</p>
<p>Plus, you are 100 percent correct in your predictions that, eventually, these anti-white subversives do have plans to begin the final phase of their objectives and begin to physically exterminate White European people.     Just this morning, the National Policy Institute mailing list sent out an article which elaborated on the current ATF gun-runner scandal which bore the following title:  &#8220;Bombshell: AFT may have been trafficking guns to Central America as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>This appears to me to be a possible effort to provide semi or fully automatic, state of the art weapons to millions of potential Hispanic/mestizo radical revolutionaries and could possibly be in attempt to equip a Che Guevara worshiping Communist revolutionary army - which might have some very sinister plans, regarding ethnic cleansing  Whites out of the Southwest portions of the USA.   Sound preposterous?   Too hard to believe?  Well, well.  </p>
<p>Do all regular AR readers remember this famous quote and the video that featured this guy&rsquo;s ravings from a few years ago?</p>
<p>&#8216;We must exterminate white people&#8221; &mdash; Dr Kamau Kambon</p>
<p>Similar proclamations have been made by a number of the more radical and provocative Hispanics who are involved in the LA Raza and Reconquista of Azlan factions, and Jared Taylor has even cited these quotes in some of his radio interviews. </p>
<p>The main point being, for Margaret&rsquo;s benefit - is that the founders of The Frankfurt School and the primary promotors of anti-White Cultural Marxism have direct alliances with these radical black and hispanic groups and that&rsquo;s where our greatest threat will be coming from.</p>

<p>I will add that this push for diversity and nonwhite immigrants happened about the SAME time in all ONCE White nations. What is so hard for Whites to figure all this out anyway? Especially all the neocon talk show hosts! Can&rsquo;t tell me that they haven&rsquo;t noticed this. So the question is, why don&rsquo;t they talk about it and inform their White listeners? I can only guess. They know who pays to put them on the air.</p>

<p>Good point. That was a strange comment.  Actually, historically speaking, Martin Luther, a dissenter, a heretic, and founder of a tiny minority religion, was in far greater danger from the Catholic Church than the Catholics were from him. He was surrounded by hostile powers of Catholic Europe, and he was the one who would have been burned.</p>
<p>I have to wonder if this is the same splendid, knowledgeable, canny &#8220;Margaret&#8221; who used to post here several years ago? It does not sound at all like the same person.</p>
<p>Luke also hit a bullseye with his observations on the Frankfurt School. The original &#8220;Margaret&#8221; was savvy enough to know the distinction; she would have known better without having to be told.</p>
<p>Btw, after leaving Germany, the Frankfurt School was recomposed in New York City largely at the New School for Social Research. Its ideology, originally &#8220;German&#8221; (or <i>from  </i>Germany), has had an &#8220;American&#8221; impetus ever since. New York City became the new base, with Hollywood as an extension.</p>
