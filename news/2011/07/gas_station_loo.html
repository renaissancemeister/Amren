<h1>Gas Station Looted Near Humboldt/North Before Mob Attacks Group in Reservoir Park</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jermont Terry and Jay Sorgi, WTMJ Newsradio, July 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of friends hanging out at Reservoir Park in Milwaukee were attacked and robbed around midnight on July 4th, minutes after the looting of a gas station near the corner of North Humboldt and East North Avenues.</p>
<p>The victims have black eyes, staples in their heads and bruises throughout their body. </p>
<p>The victims said a group of nearly 50 teenagers came running down North Avenue early Monday morning. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But minutes before a group of teens looted the BP gas station a block away at Humboldt and North.</p>
<p>The surveillance video showed boys and girls snatching chips, beverages and entire display cases before running out of the store.</p>
<p>The victims believe those same teens attacked them. </p>
<p>&#8220;They were beating up dudes and girls they were kicking my sister they kicked her head they punched me and it was guys and girls,&#8221; explained a sobbing victim. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some residents said this same group of teenagers have been running around the Riverwest neighborhood for weeks. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want anyone to be badly hurt or killed because these kids have a problem,&#8221; said the resident. </p>
<p>Milwaukee Police have not connected the two incidents. </p>
<p>But a spokesperson said on Monday they are aware of two armed robberies near the park around midnight on July 4th.</p>

		<p>Of course none of this behavior is due to anti-white, hatefilled rhetoric by the likes of those in the black community is it?  </p>
<p>Or by the likes of the leftist commentators in the media and the entertainment industry who excuse this kind of behavior?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting worse, and it is occuring throughout the nation.</p>

		<p>They can replay this story in any city with a concentration of blacks, for any summer outdoors event, and it would fit.  From the &#8220;mob of teens&#8221;, to the stealing of junk food, to the knocking to the ground and repeated kicking, the pattern holds true everywhere.</p>
<p>Which story will be the Great Awakening for white consumers of mainstream media?<br>

<p>[quote]</p>
<p>Very sorry to hear about these terrible flash mob attacks in Milwaukee. We have had many similar attacks by Black teen thugs here in Chicago.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t judge all Black African Americans by the terrible actions of these teen punks/thugs, but also please be aware that these groups are doing these attacks all over America and basically getting away with their crimes.</p>
<p>The Mainstream Media cover up these attacks and put out all kinds of spins, denials that Black criminals are targeting innocent Whites for their crimes. If the situation was reversed - White mobs targeting Blacks for group beatings, the media would be covering the situation 24/7 and Eric Holder, the Fed Civil Rights army charging everyone with Hate Crimes.</p>
<p>Please turn off your TV sets and ignore the New York Times and the rest of the Mainstream Media - they lie about crime and race.</p>
<p>Here are some excellent internet source for fair coverage of racial criminal realities.</p>

		<p>Another case of black teens &#8220;disrespecting&#8221; others.</p>
<p>I wonder:  it must always start with two or three especially bad seeds, who get the other weak-willed black teens to join in.  In a white crowd, the others would have enough morality to dissuade the original troublemakers.</p>

		<p>I wonder how long it will be until the reporting of these black mobs just stops?  The police will tell you that you didn&rsquo;t see what you just saw and no mention of it will be made in the local media. I can&rsquo;t believe it hasn&rsquo;t happened already.  This seems the only logical way to approach black crime, just pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist.   </p>

It&rsquo;s funny&hellip;has anyone else noticed the media will often trot out a concerned BLACK police rep or a concerned BLACK media rep to comment on or report these types of attacks.  It&rsquo;s just a clever way to take some of the racial &#8220;sting&#8221; out of the story.</p>
<p>Another thing that is funny&hellip;white victims always act surprised and dance around the issue of race.  If they were interviewing BLACK victims of this type of attack by WHITES, there is no way the black victims would be so restrained in their commentary.</p>

		<p>How long, do we suppose, can the American media pretend not to notice that virtually 100%(there may be an occasional Hispanic, after all)of these mobs of &#8220;youths&#8221; are black? If all these stories involved, say, Japanese youths, can anyone imagine that this fact would remain un-reported by the media? The lengths the mainstream(and essentially all)media will go to cover for black misbehavior and malfeasance is truly breathtaking! They will gleefully endager us all, rather than fully report what is obvious to all with eyes and ears!!</p>

Didn&rsquo;t you and your friends rob small stores in giant packs and beat random people who happened to be of a different race than you.  Move along.</p>

<p>As an analogy, for the first twenty-something years of her life, she thought all bears were like Yogi; fun-loving, humorous, and harmlessly looking to pilfer a pic-a-nic basket once-in-awhile.  But then she had a real bear encounter, resulting in some cognitive dissonance and awareness of the real world.</p>

		<p>&hellip;because these kids have a problem.  Indeed.  Seriously, why should they stop?  What have they to fear? I&rsquo;m about 100 pages into WHITE IDENTITY and am as tired as anyone of it.  Ever notice that no matter what, the lawyers never lose?<br>
White people are the ones who fear because we know the lawyers are salivating to make front page examples of us for defending ourselves against &#8220;teens&#8221;.  I moved from a high crime area to an almost non-existant crime area.  That&rsquo;s because no blacks live here-period.  There&rsquo;s a race war going on but most whites don&rsquo;t know it.  Watch yourselves out there folks. </p>

		<p> As an old fashioned Southerner, I get &ldquo;riled up&rdquo; over attacks on defenseless women. Maybe, this is a legacy of ante-bellum chivalry, or if some modernists prefer, &#8220;sexism&#8221; down South. In any case, &#8220;Jennifer&#8221;, the beaten and terrified, Asian? woman presented a truly pitiful and sympathetic picture on the video clip. It&rsquo;s strange that the blacks interviewed in the segment seem to brush off the attacking &#8220;youths&#8221; as: this is what happens without parental supervision  &mdash;  robbery and the senseless beating of innocent bystanders?  Other blacks claimed the &#8220;youths&rsquo; were from outside the area. The black community has to recognize that they have a problem with disproportionate crime before any improvement in this situation can be made. It&rsquo;s true that we all sit at the same table, but some aren&rsquo;t minding their manners.</p>

Police close boardwalk after fights break out<br>
By Joe Hyer | Wednesday, Jul 6, 2011 | Updated 6:47 AM </p>
<p>Things are returning to normal Tuesday afternoon in Seaside Heights, just hours after after police closed the popular boardwalk following a rash of violence.</p>
<p>The Asbury Park Press reports that fights began on the boardwalk as early as 10:30 p.m. on Monday, after the community&rsquo;s firework display wrapped up around 9:20.</p>
<p>Seaside Heights Detective Steve Korman told the newspaper that Police Chief Thomas Boyd assessed the scene as the violence increased throughout the night, and by 1 a.m., he closed the boardwalk for the safety of visitors.</p>
<p>In total, 62 people (59 adults, three juveniles) were arrested in Seaside Heights, according to the Asbury Park Press. Of those arrested, 39 were arrested on disorderly persons charges and seven were charged with interfering with the official duty of a law enforcement officer, among other charges.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Please don&rsquo;t judge all Black African Americans by the terrible actions of these teen punks/thugs, but also please be aware that these groups are doing these attacks all over America and basically getting away with their crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes this is the prominent rebuttal and line of thinking that people on the left use. &#8220;Well not every X does it, so just base on individualism in every case.&#8221; This open mind is, as to what I believe what makes people take into account many possibilities (intelligence), yet it is very dangerous.</p>
<p>The need to incorporate the exception and the anomaly in every case is prominent of the Left. In fact the exception or anomaly disproves any stereotype/rule/existence as being concrete and true&hellip;under this line of thinking. It is rationalized that stereotyping being inconsistent and fail to encompass reality. In fact it does, but our stratification of thinking leads us to believe that.</p>
<p>When applied to other examples outside of race, exceptions doesn&rsquo;t seem to necessarily disprove the rule. </p>
<p>Sexes (unless Feminist mode of thinking which would further prove my point): Men are more likely to be taller than women.  Women are are more likely to be less violent then men. Men are more likely to be stronger physically then women. Women are more likely to be more emotional then men. Thus societies (with little to no Feminist roots) build upon these notions (implementing stereotypes and discrimination). </p>
<p>Animals: Sharks are likely eat people. Ergo don&rsquo;t swim with sharks (again implementing based on stereotypes and discrimination). Cows are stupid. Don&rsquo;t allow them to be alone near water.</p>
<p>The left: Racist are intolerant bigots (stereotype and discrimination). Lets implement laws (encompassing all peoples and not basing on each individual) of hate speech (implementing based upon prejudice). Christian fundamentalist hate gays. People advocating for gun rights are violent. And so forth. </p>
<p>The point is, it is a tool that imbued in our brain for survival.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the stratification of consciousness of the particular individual and how their mind diverges on topics rather actual mode of thinking&hellip;unless others like me who understand what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

		<p>This is why we had Jim Crow laws in the South. Having lived around this race since about 1625, about 400 YEARS, the Southern man learned how this race behaves.</p>
<p>The Northerners didn&rsquo;t have 400 years of experience. Freed slaves were only passing through to Canada since in many Northern States blacks were NOT even permitted to reside. Of course you had 3 Northern Slave state on the Union side (within which Lincoln DID NOT FREE the slaves in his bogus Emancipation Proclamation&hellip;Maryland, Delaware and Minnesota, I believe). So Blacks leaving the South sure didn&rsquo;t want to stop there. Canada was the goal.</p>
<p>Anyway, this will never end until we have segregation again. A white America MUST come about where race is the deciding factor in being a citizen. WHITES ONLY was for safety for all.</p>

<p>After watching the video with the female victim I do not think she thought it was cute, I honestly think she may be a bit mentally challenged. Her facial expressions and speech just did not seem to be that of a normal adult.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Mainstream media&rsquo; is no longer in sync with normal society. Have you seen MSNBC&rsquo;s latest tagline, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39310817/" rel="nofollow">MSNBC Lean Forward</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE23NuY5T44" rel="nofollow">Rachel Maddow Leans Forward</a></p>
<p>Lean forward is a leftist slogan. You will not get objective news from them, you will get their own personal opinion on the news.</p>

I was happy to see this comment on the original site:</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<p>Very sorry to hear about these terrible flash mob attacks in Milwaukee. We have had many similar attacks by Black teen thugs here in Chicago.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t judge all Black African Americans by the terrible actions of these teen punks/thugs, but also please be aware that these groups are doing these attacks all over America and basically getting away with their crimes.</p>
<p>The Mainstream Media cover up these attacks and put out all kinds of spins, denials that Black criminals are targeting innocent Whites for their crimes. If the situation was reversed - White mobs targeting Blacks for group beatings, the media would be covering the situation 24/7 and Eric Holder, the Fed Civil Rights army charging everyone with Hate Crimes.</p>
<p>Please turn off your TV sets and ignore the New York Times and the rest of the Mainstream Media - they lie about crime and race.</p>
<p>Here are some excellent internet source for fair coverage of racial criminal realities.</p>
<p>vdare.com<br>
amren.com<br>
occidentaldissent.com</p>
<p>[end quote]</p>
<p><br>
These stories are drawing people to AmRen, where they will see similar stories.</p>
<p>Jack responds:</p>
<p>I posted this comment. My advice is to respond in similar ways on the comment sections of on-line local newspapers. Try to include something positive about not judging all Black people in a negative way on the basis of the terrible actions of some criminals, but then state the truth about racial realities regarding crime and the fact that the mainstream media censors Black on White violence and then try to include a link to Amren or something else on our side like Vdare.com </p>
<p>We need to do the hard work and not just complain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Canada really appreciated southern escaped slaves being dumped on them. One more innocent victim of the greed and shortsightedness of slaveowners. Btw, Minnesota was never a slave state. Did you mean Missouri? As for the border states, which you inaccurately call &#8220;northern slave states&#8221;, Lincoln didn&rsquo;t include them in the emancipation proclamation out of political expediency and strategic neccessity. Why drive three more states into the Confederacy? As for you wise old southerners knowing about blacks unlike us dumb northerners, well you guys had slavery which brought this race here to America, so you were able to learn how this race behaves. But you guys caused all our problems in the first place. IF I WERE A SOUTHERNER, rather then taking a smug, &#8216;told you so&rsquo; attitude, I would feel deeply ashamed and saddened that my people were responsible for all this misery to ALL whites in the first place.</p>

<p>  I can see no point in re-fighting the Civil War. Our current situation is so serious that whites will either rise or fall together. Black slavery was a horrible mistake and a curse on our nation, but the majority of Southerners did not own slaves. History is a nightmare from which we can&rsquo;t wake up. Spreading dissention and conflict in our ranks helps our numerous liberal enemies.</p>

<p>And we can ask if this is related to other obvious signs of the disintegration of civilization: open frontiers with millions of third worlders pouring across them; the domination of inner cities by criminal gangs;  the crumbling infrastructure in America; the dispossession of whites in the USA and Europe; the general sell-out by ruling elites of their own citizens; etc.</p>
<p>Will future generations look at American/Western Civ in this era the way we look at the Roman world in AD 476 ? </p>

I wonder how bad it will have to get before municipalities like NYC and Chicago allow common citizens to arm themselves and shoot back.<br>
________________<br>
they will never allow it, the only option (and the one they obviously want us to take) is to become law-breakers with illegal guns, to fight the thug-gangs. Yes they will immediately pounce on a story of a White shooting up the next &#8220;flash&#8221; mob when it attacks, and they will not mention the race of the flashmobbers until this happens. martyrdom awaits.</p>

		<p>To Sardonicus: (I am #33:)</p>
<p>Most southerners were not slaveowners. But most slaveowners were southerners.</p>
<p>In any case I am a northerner who just doesn&rsquo;t like a southerner telling me &#8220;I don&rsquo;t get it&#8221; about blacks. Especially when I DO &#8220;get it&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221; was a problem imposed on me by the south.</p>
<p>If I caused a problem, I would try to repair the damage, not make fun of other people who suffer from the damage but didn&rsquo;t cause it. If I break a window in somebody&rsquo;s house, what should I do? Fix it or make fun of the people inside for having rain on their carpet? </p>

		<p>I lived in the ghetto in Baltimore and you could always expect to get jumped by blacks for being white and I was.  The difference here is they are expanding their turf, they know there is no room for them in jail, juveniles just get citations anyway plus to them its a badge of honor to have a record, plus in jail it is a huge party and free everything for them and they hang out with their homies so to them there really is no down side.</p>

<p>Where do you think the heart of the organized opposition to the civil rights movement was based?  Did George Wallace &#8220;make fun of other people who suffered from the damage&#8221; when he campaigned hard north of the MDL and won states like Michigan and won whole swarths of urban working and middle class whites in Boston and Milwaukee and other similar cities?</p>
