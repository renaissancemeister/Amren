			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), July 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of Britain&rsquo;s most exclusive hotels has been accused of throwing out a visitor  &mdash;  for being white and English.</p>
<p>Claridge&rsquo;s in Mayfair, central London, has been a favourite venue for the rich and famous and is often referred to as &#8216;an extension of Buckingham Palace&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But socialite and writer Taki Theodoracopulos has accused the establishment of favouring rich Arabs who spend frivolously over British aristocrats.</p>
<p>Theodoracopulos said that he was with a group of friends at the hotel&rsquo;s bar when he was asked to leave because the staff &#8216;were hoping for Gulf people&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8216;We were neither drunk nor obstreperous but we were refused a table although the place was less than one third full,&rsquo; Theodoracopulos wrote in his Spectator magazine High Life column.</p>
<p>Theodoracopulos said that he had dined nearby with his group of friends, including the Marquess of Worcester and his brother Lord John Somerset.</p>
<p>The 74-year-old Greek-born writer said that he wanted a table but was asked to leave.</p>
<p>Theodoracopulos, who has homes in London, New York and Switzerland, is demanding an apology and calling for a boycott of the venue.</p>
<p>&#8216;Harry Worcester had the brilliant idea to go to Claridge&rsquo;s bar for a drink,&rsquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8216;After politely suggesting that the management should give us one, the maitre d&rsquo; came over and asked us to leave.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lord Worcester protested, as did his brother Lord John Somerset. I was at the bar and unaware we were being given the heave-ho. Once I caught on, it was too late. My party was out the door.</p>
<p>&#8216;So here&rsquo;s what I think happened and why I am outraged. We were speaking English, we were white and we had not demanded myriad bottles of champagne.</p>
<p>&#8216;The staff were obviously hoping for Gulf people, whose moolah (slang for money) derives from the theft of their countries&rsquo; resources.</p>
<p>&#8216;The idea that four English-speaking European gents with four ladies in tow are asked to leave Claridge&rsquo;s is as outrageous as it&rsquo;s foul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hotel has denied any knowledge of the incident and rejects the idea that they prefer wealthy Arabs as guests.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have checked. There is no record of such an incident. I think he is being deliberately provocative and mischievous,&rsquo; a spokesman told the Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>But Theodoracopulos said he stands by his story is &#8216;still very upset by what happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hotel was founded in in 1812 as Mivart&rsquo;s Hotel in a conventional London terraced house. It grew steadily over the years and expanded into neighbouring houses.</p>
<p>Claridge&rsquo;s flourished after the First World War due to demand from aristocrats who no longer maintained a London house.</p>
<p>Well-known guests include Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn,  Alfred Hitchcock, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, U2 and Mariah Carey.</p>
<p>Typical rooms at the five star hotel around Â£400 per night. Claridge&rsquo;s is owned by Maybourne Hotel Group, which also has two other five-star luxury hotels in London, The Berkeley and The Connaught.</p>

		<p>According to the Wikipedia, the Maybourne Hotel Group&rsquo;s largest shareholder Derek Quinlan owes 600 000 000 pounds, so he may be getting desperate but a guy named Taki Theodor&hellip;whatever would not have to stand up for Whites rights in the UK if the Native Brits weren&rsquo;t oblivious &amp; indifferent to losing their country.</p>

		<p>I am actually quite sceptical of this story. He says,</p>
<p>&#8220;&lsquo;After politely suggesting that the management should give us one, the maitre d&rsquo; came over and asked us to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why would you &#8220;suggest&#8221; to the management to give you a drink, in a bar, and not simply ask the bar staff? Was it out of legal licencing hours? Is it a private bar for hotel guests or by advanced booking only? There is something odd here.</p>

These men are high minded and deserved the boot.</p>
<p>For the dough they&rsquo;re worth, and let&rsquo;s be realistic, they could have rented London&rsquo;s Hooters and hosted the Union Jack Club.</p>
<p>Making an example out of these men doesnt take the employees and the Clairidge off the hook either.</p>
<p>The whole situation points to the state of money and people who have nothing better to do with it then to find a bad guy to point their fingers.</p>
<p>The whole world needs to come togeather and say enough is enough.<br>
The world is tired big oil and their bankers in the Persian Gulf and the trail of oil, weapons, and drugs, that follow them.</p>

		<p>How do you spell lunacy?  C-l-a-r-i-d-g-e  Taki should never give this outfit another dime - ever!  Ditto to any white who reads this article.</p>
<p>Forget about boycotting the place.  Avoid the place, even if they do grovel.<br>

		<p>This happened at Claridge&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Taki is an entertaining writer - do a short search for *Taki&rsquo;s blog* - but this story smells of very dead fish.</p>
<p>The hotel in question is one of the most prestigious in the U.K., open to all who can afford to eat, drink and stay there; in my opinion, a hotel with an international reputation simply wouldn&rsquo;t behave like this.</p>

		<p>Far as I&rsquo;m concerned the hotel can discriminate as it sees fit.  I&rsquo;d publicize their policy.    <br>
I&rsquo;d give my business to a place where I&rsquo;m welcome.    <br>
The&#8221;authorities&#8221; will not be able to rationally justify/explain allowing this discimination but not that discrimination.  <br>
But no doubt they&rsquo;ll tie themselves in knots trying. </p>

		<p>Why would he lie? Things like this happen all the time (take it from me). Usually the would be patrons just leave, luckily Taki can write. I have seen this kind of thing before  &mdash;  pushing around folks that are polite and won&rsquo;t resist in such establishments here in the US. Why don&rsquo;t some of you show some support? Why should anyone come to your defense next time you have similar trouble being out on the town?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Taki&rsquo;s story is accurate or not, but we should be especially cautious of such stories.  All the MSM needs is one or two such discredited tales - and they&rsquo;ll blow them all out of proportion and imply that, just as those were fake, so too are the others.</p>
<p>There is no lack of verified and accurate instances of anti-white discrimination and violence.  Let&rsquo;s focus on those and treat the others with caution.</p>

<p>Muslim Arabs, even the women, behave completely different while abroad. that is well known, and documented.  Remember the 9/11 terrorists frequented strip bars while they were preparing.  They indulged in every Western Vice.  The scope of Arab/Muslim hypocrisy is enormous.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t be so skeptical (yes, that&rsquo;s how to spell it).</p>
