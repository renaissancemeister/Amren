<h1><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/125027704.html">Flynn Calls Looting, Beatings in Riverwest Barbaric</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Meg Jones, Journal Sentinel (Milwaukie), July 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shaina Perry remembers the punch to her face, blood streaming from a cut over her eye, her backpack with her asthma inhaler, debit card and cellphone stolen, and then the laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just said &#8216;Oh, white girl bleeds a lot,&rsquo; &#8221; said Perry, 22, who was attacked at Kilbourn Reservoir Park over the Fourth of July weekend.</p>
<p>Though Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn noted Tuesday that crime is colorblind, he called the Sunday night looting of a convenience store near the park and beatings of a group of people who had gone to the park disturbing, outrageous and barbaric.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not going to let any group of individuals terrorize or bully any of our neighborhoods,&#8221; Flynn said.</p>
<p>Perry was among several who were injured by a mob they said beat and robbed them and threw full beer bottles while making racial taunts. The injured people were white; the attackers were African-American, witnesses said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At some point the group of friends and the group of youths intersected; those interviewed said the attack appeared to be unprovoked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw people dancing and I figured they were just having a good time,&#8221; said Riverwest resident Jessica Bublitz, 28.</p>
<p>Minutes later Bublitz saw a male friend hit in the temple and fall down. Her fiancé told her to run to safety. James Zajackowski, 28, said things suddenly turned chaotic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within 30 seconds to a minute, bottles were flying and people started getting punched. I was in shock. I thought, &#8216;Really? Is this really happening?&rsquo; I was on the ground, people were trying to get into my pockets, I could feel their hands but I held on to my cellphone and my wallet,&#8221; said Zajackowski, a census worker.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Andy Lange, 29, a social worker who has lived in Riverwest for 10 years, said one of his friends was hit in the head with a bottle and needed staples to close the wound. Lange said he was struck in the face and didn&rsquo;t even see who hit him.</p>
<p>Perry needed three stitches to close a cut above her eye. She said she saw a friend getting kicked and when she walked up to ask what was happening, a man punched her in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard laughing as they were beating everybody up. They were eating chips like it was a picnic,&#8221; said Perry, a restaurant cashier. &#8220;All I remember is seeing bright lights (after the punch), then my backpack was gone and blood was spurting out of my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of the 11 people who told the Journal Sentinel they were attacked or witnessed the attacks on their friends said that police did not take their complaints seriously. They each said police responded to the scene quickly and tended to the injured, but officers did not take statements from them and told them to leave the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ve got 20-plus people giving eyewitness accounts. I&rsquo;m very surprised that they said it wasn&rsquo;t a mob,&#8221; said Mowrer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;About 20 of us stayed to give statements and make sure everyone was accounted for. The police wouldn&rsquo;t listen to us, they wouldn&rsquo;t take our names or statements. They told us to leave. It was completely infuriating,&#8221; Bublitz said.</p>

<p>Which means, &#8220;don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions, unless you are jumping to the conclusion that &#8216;it has nothing to do with race&rsquo; &#8220;.</p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t see themselves as a group of individuals when they are acting in unison to attack vulnerable and defenseless Whites, so why should we feel obligated to see them as individuals?</p>
<p>Do these &#8220;individuals&#8221; ever say how homesick they are for Africa? </p>

<p>Flynn is a hypocrite.  Did Flynn also instruct his &#8220;so called&#8221; police officers not to take witness reports and in fact not to make any reports on this obvious racial attack?.</p>

		<p><i>The injured people were white; the attackers were African-American, witnesses said.</i></p>
<p>The fact that the reporter feels compelled to use a clunky seven-syllable euphemism instead of &#8220;black&#8221;, while we don&rsquo;t get the same privilege, reinforces our being second-class citizens.</p>
<p>For the record, I am in favor of using &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; rather than silly PC euphemisms of any kind.</p>

		<p>I have to be in the area in three weeks. I looked up the demographics and was surprised to find that Milwaukee was 40% Black. So I looked up Madison and found it was 7% Black AND 40 miles closer to my destination. So I guess I know where my base of operations will be. It made me wish that Vegas had the odds right there on the green felt so you could make an informed bet&hellip; </p>

		<p>Wonder if these young urban whites will double down on typical liberal talking points like the &#8220;Onion girl?&#8221;  Honestly I hope this type of thing wakes people up, one at a time if need be.  </p>
<p>I have to say that I&rsquo;m getting pretty embarrassed that white people, even in a group, aren&rsquo;t fighting back against these blacks mobs.  If your going to take it, you might as well give it.    </p>

		<p>The police and mayor were involved in a cover-up of a group of Blacks robbing and beating whites after the holiday fireworks.  This occurred in a very liberal, diverse neighborhood.  Now there is a pr effort to get parents to turn in their &#8220;children&#8221; who may have been involved in the racist attacks.  Of course, nothing will happen to those who are apprehended.  For once I added a comment to the Journal Sentinel on line, stating this incident was a good argument for the recently passed concealed-carry law in Wisconsin.  Many of those commenting made it clear it was a racist mob attack.  Now I note all the comments have been removed.  In Milwaukee our Mayor and Police Chief want us to pretend we live in a city without hate-whitey racists, without young Black criminals, without crime.  Liberal Milwaukee drifts down the direction of Detroit.</p>

		<p>It is ever more clear now that this was a race attack, but it should not be surprising since here in Milwaukee the anti white sentiment is never very far under the facade of multi culti smiling.<br>
If the summer passes without more of these attacks I will be very surprised.</p>

		<p>Imagine if a group of white youths viciously attacked blacks at random and racially taunted them. Jesse and Al would be in town demanding &#8220;justice&#8221; faster than a speeding bullet. CNN would do a one hour special on these atrocious &#8216;hate crimes.&rsquo; This would be a huge news item throughout the MSM. The SPLC&rsquo;s Mark Potok would be providing commentry on all the main networks. Headlines in the major newspapers would describe how these terrible &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; have &#8220;spareked outrage&#8221; and generated &#8220;fear&#8221; in the African-American community.</p>

		<p>The police in the Milwaukee area are also afraid of running afoul of the race hustlers, so white victims can expect little to be done to those who attack them.</p>
<p>You now find these &#8216;youffs&rsquo; all over the midwest, northeast and even northwest.  It is increasingly difficult to find refuge from them.  In my home town of 30,000, in the upper midwest, ten years ago there were no &#8216;africans&rsquo;   &mdash;  - now I see them every day in random places all over town and even in the back roads.  I don&rsquo;t know where I can go to live that american dream anymore.</p>

		<p>I went to this years Fourth of July Fireworks and had a wonderful time mostly because most of the people were white. I kind of wallowed in all the whiteness. I soaked it all in. It was beautiful, the kids were running around having a blast. This is how it was meant to be, I thought. White people with other white people. Diversity be damned. Then as I was leaving i seen a few black and hispanic families and I said to myself, man, if this was reversed and the majority were black or hispanic they would be beating up the white people. </p>

		<p>The police chief is a political stooge. He&rsquo;s already weathered a sex scandal - I&rsquo;m surprised he&rsquo;s still in office. His job is to lie about crime statistics (I live near Milwaukee).</p>
<p>And what is this supposed to mean:</p>
<p>&#8220;Though Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn noted Tuesday that crime is colorblind, he called the Sunday night looting of a convenience store near the park and beatings of a group of people who had gone to the park disturbing, outrageous and barbaric.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I can hardly wait to see the comments in Eugene Kane&rsquo;s column.  Probably dismiss this to the fact that boys will be boys, or better yet, they were just getting rid of some of their hostilities that were brought on by the fact that their great great grandfathers were slaves. Need I remind all of you African-Americans that your great great grandfathers were sold into slavery by your OWN RACE! Also, whites were also slaves.  Can we get reparations from YOU!    </p>

		<p>Now I see why my comments and those of others were deleted by the Milw. Jour. Sent.  Here are a few comments by Police Chief Flynn from the on line Milw. newspaper:</p>
<p>Flynn has called a community meeting to talk to residents in the Riverwest neighborhood at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday about the events of July 3.<br>
He said it was important to challenge commentary in some blogs and reader comments on news stories that emphasize the race of the victims and suspects.<br>
&#8220;We can&rsquo;t allow this activity to divide this community because ultimately it&rsquo;s this community standing together that will identify these individuals and ultimately bring them to justice.&#8221;<br>
   So the broblem is not the Black racist barbarians, but those who comment about the Black racist barbarians.  &mdash;    &mdash;  -HM</p>

		<p>A couple of things to take note of:  Always research the demographics of an area before relocating, travel, or even passing through.  I make City Data and Wikipedia my friend in researching the number of blacks in any given area.  That said, you will see that there is still a large amount of area in the USA that is almost entirely white.  New England, the Appalachians, most of the midwest-minus the urban areas, the Pacific Northwest, Montana, Idaho.  All are great areas and mostly free of criminal blacks. As a rule, I don&rsquo;t hang out for long in areas that have more than 10% black. The odds of harassment, crime increase exponentially.</p>

<p>You may be able to argue that it may not be targeting Caucasians specifically but you cannot argue that actual committing of the crime is &#8220;colorblind.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another attack.  They&rsquo;re getting so frequent now it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with all of them.</p>
<p>The only thing I know for sure is that the press and authorities are going to continue with their obfuscations, identifying the perps as &#8220;teens&#8221; or &#8220;youths,&#8221; without admitting that they&rsquo;re black and that we have a black problem, not a crime problem.</p>
<p>The newspaper forums are hopping mad with white complainants, except for those papers that are so far into left field they can&rsquo;t see home plate.</p>

		<p>A real part of this story is that if it were not for this site and, say, the Drudge Report, we would not be aware of this and other violent outbreaks. Where are the reports in our local papers and TV news? This type of behavior is not going to happen in jurisdictions where law abiding people are carrying firearms.</p>

<i>&#8220;The police wouldn&rsquo;t listen to us, they wouldn&rsquo;t take our names or statements.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Something similar happened to me a few years back.</p>
<p>I was on the bus going to work. The bus was at it&rsquo;s first stop waiting to leave on time. A group of blacks, sitting in the back of the bus (naturally), had a beef with the driver for leaving on time and not waiting for their friend. (Really, how long did they think it was appropriate to wait for a guy who may not even show up. Were people on the bus expected to miss their connections just to wait for one guy? Being self-centered, blacks rarely consider how their behavior impacts others nor do they care.)</p>
<p>The driver left at the designated time and the blacks in back of he bus started screaming at the driver. &#8220;FU MF!&#8221; Since they were behind me, I grabbed a note pad and wrote down their taunts, name-calling, and threats.</p>
<p>The driver got on the phone to report the incident.</p>
<p>When the police arrived, the black guys got off the bus and nonchalantly waked away.</p>
<p>The bus driver and I were telling the police what happened while the police stood with their backs to the black men who were leaving. I was reciting their comments and both the driver and I were pointing to the black guys walking away.</p>
<p>The police never turned around to look at the black men let alone stop them and question them.</p>
<p>The officers listened to us and told the driver that he could file a complaint if he wanted.</p>
<p>It was at that moment I realized that the police weren&rsquo;t going to do anything.<br>

		<p>If there were one, ONE single White elected official in this countrty that gave a tinker&rsquo;s damn about his people and would demand an end to this racially-motivated, black lawlessness and violence, it would be nice! But alas, that is not to be. Not ONE of the vile cowards will get in front of a camera, or in front of his colleagues and sterly CONDEMN this anti-White bigotry and mayhem. </p>
<p>And when we are FORCED to take our protection into our own hands, it will be those same spineless swine who condemn such &#8220;violence&#8221; and insist no one &#8220;rush to judgement&#8221; and all the familiar plattitudes! </p>
<p>There is a WAR being waged upon our people - are we going to do anything about it, or just whine on the internet until each and everyone of us is a victim of these marauding primitives?</p>

<p>This dereliction of duty doesn&rsquo;t occur just when blacks attack whites. It occurs for almost all crime  &mdash;  I had 12 guns stolen from my basement last month, and the police made no effort to recover them, even though I told the police who had taken the guns (it was a white guy). They didn&rsquo;t make the effort because they had too much other stuff to do (mostly chasing black guys).</p>
<p>To fix this we need to hire many more police officers and build many more prisons. In other words, we need to pay much higher taxes. I think I&rsquo;m willing, but I would bet that most of my fellow citizens are not. </p>

		<p>The police chief is a coward. Added to that most cops like the status-quo and can&rsquo;t bring themselves to question authority no matter how corrupt it is. As long as they are told not to charge blacks with hate crimes they won&rsquo;t. Most white cops only have loyalty to other cops not white civilians.</p>

		<p>Where is the deterrent? Whites have little defense since they won&rsquo;t unite like the primitives do. The crazy white liberal will never condemn black barbarism. The bozos on MSNBC or in the SPLC are focused exclusively white misdeeds, like mis-spellings or minor gaffes. No other race has to contend with the equivalent of the crazy white liberal. Can you imagine a black Chris Matthews? Of course it&rsquo;s preposterous. Blacks do not tolerate such treachery. It seems hopeless to me. The white liberal is your enemy!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incredible the degree of scripted and codified denial is practiced by government and media across the board on these all black mob attacks.   They simply refuse to call them what they are.   </p>
<p>Racist black mobs are called &#8220;flash mobs.&#8221;   Originally &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; where people who broke out into spontaneous song and dance in public locales at a pre-arranged time.</p>
<p>Many on one beatings of many blacks on a lone non-black are called &#8220;fights&#8221;.     They&rsquo;re not fights.  They&rsquo;re brutal, cowardly, aggravated assaults.</p>
<p>This is exactly how socialist societies work.  The truth is not what happens but what the state wants to say happened.   The state (and its lackeys in the supposedly private media) are on board with ramming the equality mythology down everyones throats.   We&rsquo;re all equally smart and equally in control.   The fact that blacks demonstrate themselves on average to be less civil and more violent must be hidden at all cost because it violates the edicts coming out of central planning. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend that non-blacks start taking responsibility for their own personal security because the government is fully prepared to let you get chased down and beaten to death by a mob of black psychopaths and then claim you had a &#8220;fight&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I had been waiting for a lot of reporting of black violence and crime over the 4th of July because of all the Memorial Day incidents. One of my favorite TV shows of the year is the PBS &#8220;A Capitol 4th&#8221;. Every year several hundred thousand overwhelmingly white Americans gather in DC for this patriotic show. Of course the cameras have to find the blacks attending and show them as often as possible. The media in the USA always tries very hard to portray blacks positively. Yet blacks always rise to the occasion and show what they truly are in the end. My best wishes for a speedy recovery for the victims of this viscious Black Mob.</p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m amazed that the white victims caught up in these Black mobs are in utter disbelief of the danger they were in and infact are lucky to be alive.I have known since first grade that the very second Blacks have an advantage either in numbers or lack of police presence this is what happens. These stupid whites have no clue to the extent of the savagery they narrowly escaped.</p>

<p>click link for whole thing</p>
<p>my comments on the excerpts</p>
<p>1) &#8216;another isolated incident&rsquo; - isn&rsquo;t it always</p>
<p>2) &#8216;Poverty is no excuse for bad behavior.&rsquo; glad to hear it but be careful when going off PC MC script; next thing you know you will be tagged racist by SPLC</p>
<p>3) &#8216;Programs to keep them occupied can help&rsquo; - bring back Midnight Basketball, yeah</p>
<p>4) &#8216;So can summer jobs&rsquo; - let&rsquo;s see your editorial for strong border control, employee verification and deportation and reducing legal immigration</p>
<p>5) &#8216;But we&rsquo;d agree with Flynn, who said crime is colorblind.&rsquo;- that&rsquo;s more like it. SPLC defers action</p>
<p>6) &#8216;Flynn also downplayed the notion that police tried to minimize the severity of the incidents. Flynn said that initially police weren&rsquo;t fully informed of the details.&rsquo;  - that&rsquo;ll happen when cops don&rsquo;t want to take any details from the victims/witnesses</p>
<p>7) &#8220;barbaric&#8221; - on thin ice there, watch it</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/8lm1V" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/8lm1V</a></p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s mob-like activity was similar to another isolated incident earlier this year at Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa. In the January incident, officials had to shut down the mall after groups of unruly youths began looting and fighting.</p>
<p>Poverty is no excuse for bad behavior. There are a number of single parents who overcome long odds to raise children who respect the law and other people. Strong parenting and positive role models help kids make good decisions. Programs to keep them occupied can help. So can summer jobs, because they provide a paycheck and instill a sense of responsibility. Responsible kids don&rsquo;t usually get caught up in such attacks.</p>
<p>Some witnesses and residents questioned whether race played a role in the looting and beatings. Witnesses say the attacks were unprovoked and that the victims were white and the attackers were African-American. But we&rsquo;d agree with Flynn, who said crime is colorblind. Flynn also downplayed the notion that police tried to minimize the severity of the incidents. Flynn said that initially police weren&rsquo;t fully informed of the details.</p>
<p>OK, so now that Flynn has the information - complete with a video - we would like to see his department work with the community to prevent future incidents such as this one, which the chief so accurately called &#8220;barbaric,&#8221; &#8220;disturbing&#8221; and &#8220;outrageous.&#8221;</p>

<p>July 3rd assault victims air criticisms of police at Riverwest meeting</p>
<p>Victims aim criticism at Chief Flynn&rsquo;s police force</p>
<p>Jeremy Ross FOX6 Reporter</p>
<p>9:27 p.m. CDT, July 6, 2011<br>
WITI-TV, MILWAUKEE &mdash; </p>
<p>The victims of the July 3rd attacks speak out at a public meeting in the Riverwest community. The victims were critical of police saying officers made them feel like it was their fault for getting attacked.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn acknowledged during some of the robberies racial slurs were uttered, but quickly added the victims spanned at least four ethnic groups. During the July 6th public meeting he talked about some of the progress in the case, but one group wanted to talk about the police department.</p>
<p>The only part of July 3rd crime spree caught on camera was the looting of a BP gas station on Humboldt and North, other crimes followed the looting. Chief Flynn says, &#8220;We had a lot of people terrorized we had people robbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say there were at least six armed robberies with at least eleven victims, most around the same time as the looting.</p>
<p>Some residents sat in the Riverwest meeting with emotional scars, others with more obvious signs of trauma. One victim who didn&rsquo;t want to talk to us, showed us her injuries following her assault.</p>
<p>Jessica said, &#8220;Some of us heard glass break we look up to see the mob converging.&#8221; Jessica spoke for the victims of the July 3rd attacks. &#8220;Many of the group did not see the people until they had already been taken by surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>She described a group of 30 friends leaving a barbeque to watch the fireworks at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Kilbourn Reservoir Park. Chaos followed and in the meeting Jessica accused police of not helping enough. &#8220;We feel as if the proper measures were not taken and the victims were made to feel at fault, because we were at the wrong place at the wrong time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Flynn says, &#8220;It certiainly is unacceptable to treat victims witn uncaring behavior or like they don&rsquo;t count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessica said, &#8220;19 people had stayed at the top of the hill to find stolen possessions, find friends and to give statements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flynn responded, &#8220;We&rsquo;re not likely to take 19 separate statements about a single crime given our other obligations at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Flynn said the department will look into the complaints. &#8220;If there is a general sense that this district is undeserving then we need to know more about it &#8220;</p>

		<p>Amazing how the colored people can be so vicious. This is not out of the norm though. Advice: Stay away from them and don&rsquo;t be near their activities. Don&rsquo;t rent to them, live near them; only interact with them when necessary.</p>
<p>They are the only race of people like this. </p>
<p>Oh, remember that the government is going to run interference for them as always. They are afraid of Blacks and their intimidation techniques. </p>

		<p>It is not a hate crime because the victims were white.  Holder is not investigating hate crimes against white people because whites have no rights Holder will acknowledge.  sounds insane but that is policy folks.  It should be obvious to anyone that white folk have become professional victims in effect.  Everyone is so afraid of being called racist they will do anything to avoid that name being applied to them.  At some point the white folk will find their baackbone and at that point the world will tremble.</p>

		<p>There is something afoot; some concerted move to target whites in USA SA and other(Eng, Belgium).  Here in South Africa the white food producing farmers are brutally maimed then killed and robbed of `something`. Also in suburban areas,the murders and house invasions are perpetrated by black men. It is quite revealing to read news from US and SA-very similar. Here in SA the teen flash mob is not vogue BUT teens do take part in robberies,farm and home invasions murdering and maiming.  THE MSM will never say a BLACK man killed or robbed so and so BUT if it is a white person then the MSM will accentuate that it is a WHITE person and the motive is racism.  I m not a conspiracy luny but why is the MSM world wide so racist and bias yet owned by the lily whites?  Weird beyond weird. We have a youngster Julius Malema who positions himself to be SA`s first true Marxist Leader-who would sing songs like `kill the boer, shoot the farmer` in public!  He has been taken to court but his followers(himself) sung it-as recently as 3 weeks ago at their conference.  NO international MSM picked up on it and NO outcry-even BONO said that it is justified?&hellip;</p>
<p>Yesterday on NEWS24 Business a survey of SA businesses said that 50% experienced contact crime in their businesses!  THAT IS HIGH!!  Most of these owners want to immigrate and take their businesses with them.</p>
<p>According to NationMaster SA is number one in gun vionence and murder in the world-&hellip;.and the colour of the hands pulling the trigger, thrusting the knife is&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Fill in-</p>

		<p>The permanent solution to all this?</p>
<p>Simple.  Ethno-states.   Exclusive, whites-only, defined and firmly established territory to be inhabited by whites only.<br>
Reminder:  Inventors and promoters of Cultural Marxism will not be welcome in this new white homeland.</p>
<p>There is no other realistic way to deal with this minority violence being directed at whites, people.   </p>
<p>The longer we wait, the longer we procrastinate in making this critical and justified survival decision, the worse this violence against us will get.   Does any white individual think that once we become a minority, and these non-whites achieve supreme numerical power over us (and our paychecks), that they will allow their white cash cow and white tax slaves to leave and set up our own homeland?  </p>
<p>The time to act is now, not later.</p>

&#8220;I have to say that I&rsquo;m getting pretty embarrassed that white people, even in a group, aren&rsquo;t fighting back against these blacks mobs. If your going to take it, you might as well give it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those have been my thoughts, Eric, everytime one of these incidents occur, but after reflecting on it I concluded that most black on white attacks occur by several&hellip;or an entire mob&hellip;.of blacks who pounce on whites who are alone or fewer in number.</p>
<p>Many of us here consider ourselves quite capable of self-defense, but nobody can stand up to a gang or mob and often the best these victims can do is try to protect themselves from being killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Whites are also at a disadvantage in mindset.  By that I mean most whites are in laid back mode and don&rsquo;t carry a chip on their shoulders, because white hate preachers don&rsquo;t dominate the airwaves and neighborhoods, telling them that the reason they can&rsquo;t get ahead in life is the fault of blacks.  </p>
<p>Blacks hear that about whites every day from one black criminal or another and the radical leftist media, to the point that it all has been eagerly accepted as a fact by 99% of them.  Blacks are continuously in a rage about whites.  These same black talking heads and the media support and encourage those feelings.</p>
<p>And the average black himself, with his arrogance, believes he is superior and is more than eager to believe his inability to pass tests or learn data is the fault of someone other than himself. </p>
<p>Add to that black feelings of jealousy, because they aren&rsquo;t doing as well.  Blacks fight and attack other non-whites for this same reason, especially Hispanics and Asians. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming more and more apparent to see that this black on white problem is beginning to create a backlash among whites, in spite of all the mind conditioning tactics to keep them intimidated and quiet.  It&rsquo;s leading up to something that will be extremely serious, because there&rsquo;s no end in sight to this current situation.  It&rsquo;s probably too late to change things.</p>

		<p>THE most important statement in all of this is:</p>
<p><i>Most said that police did not take their complaints seriously.</i></p>
<p>Got THAT? </p>
<p>The police don&rsquo;t give a ***** about your White life.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think blacks don&rsquo;t know this!!  They now have the message, loud and clear, that it is Open Season on Whites.  They can attack, rob, beat and maim us with impunity and the police won&rsquo;t do a thing about it.</p>
<p>The blacks are only doing what the government allows them to do.  If the government felt White lives were worthy of protection, these mobs would be shut down in one day, met with deadly police or military force and all Whites waned and advised to arm themselves against black attack   &mdash;   with black crime statistics repeated endlessly by the media.</p>
<p>So WHO will protect you and come to your aid against vicious black mobs that target you because of your White skin??  What will you do when they come onto your street and onto your property and scream &#8220;We need to kill ALL White people!!&#8221; at you and your children as they did recently in Peoria? </p>
<p>Has anyone in the government called for an investigation into these black hate crimes against Whites?  Anyone in the media?  Anyone in the justice department come out and said these attacks and racial threats &#8220;will not be tolerated?&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you have an idea now as to what the government, media, academia and justice dept. think about your worthless White life??  </p>
<p>THIS is what we Whites are up against in the NWO as we lose our homelands and why I keep writing on here that we Whites are facing GENOCIDE at the hands of our own government! See, we are not so different from the Whites in SA who are being genocided by their own &#8220;elected officials&#8221;  <i>and there&rsquo;s nothing they can do about it </i> as their guns are being confiscated.</p>
<p>Here is a list from a financial site that has switched from doling out fiscal advice to warning about the coming collapse of the economy and attendant mayhem:</p>
<p>1.  Stash some cash: Keep at least $1,000 in small denominations around the house or other secure location. Small bills are preferable. (don&rsquo;t think precious metals will become worthless, at no time in history has gold been worth nothing)</p>
<p>2.  Stash some silver:   You need to obtain a stash of one-ounce silver rounds or pre-1965 dimes, quarters, or half dollars from a reputable bullion dealer. </p>
<p>3. Stash some food: </p>
<p>4.  Install an alarm system in your home: Home break ins and home invasions are on the rise. An alarm system will encourage thieves to look elsewhere for their next score.</p>
<p>5. Get a gun for home defense: if your state has a concealed carry law, get a permit. </p>
<p>6.  Load up on Ammunition:  The Obama Administration has taken steps to limit the public&rsquo;s access to ammunition. There have been shortages as more and more people are stocking up. I suggest you even consider obtaining an ammo reload kit.</p>
<p>7. Establish an emergency escape plan: This can also save your life if you decide to stay home and ride it all out. </p>
<p>Spread the Word and tell everyone you know   &mdash;   ALL Whites should be well informed as to what we&rsquo;re facing as the Rule of Law breaks down and no longer applies to White lives.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t fight back because we only bring out more hate and hostility when we dare resist &#8220;they justified beating of some of our racist unearned white privilege out of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blacks feel justified in beating Whiteys.  But if Whiteys resist, that means we actually resist social justice, which justifies a worse beating or murder.</p>
<p>Until Whiteys travel in packs as big as the blacks do, which we shouldn&rsquo;t because it would just invite immediate gunfire into our group, we shouldn&rsquo;t fight back.   </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the DOJ, NAACP, SPLC, ADl, ACLU, etc, to pay for the legal case against us and supply the best lawyers in the land to prove we committed a hate crime by striking a black.</p>
<p>Folks, we need to start thinking like an oppressed, marginalized, and vulnerable minority.  Blacks learned how to avoid lynching by not getting into trouble.  </p>
<p>We need to avoid beating by not being in any area where blacks congregate.  Face it, we are submerged.</p>
<p>The difference?  We won&rsquo;t have a cavalry coming to our rescue.   Who defended the blacks? Whiteys.  Who will defend you? Nobody.</p>
<p>Just sink and accept what has been done to you.  Despair is resistance. Just accept that you are a member of a race that committed suicide, and you&rsquo;re misery was planned and carried out by your own kind.</p>
<p>Angry? Then find ways to force Whitey elites to suffer.   Put them into the news stories for failure to speak out in defense of their own people.  If they have power, use it against them by showing everybody who supports them that they support a race traitor.   </p>
<p>As black violence gets worse, some Whiteys will lose tolerance for Whiteys who allow it to happen.  This creates opportunities for a hereditary chieftain to arise. But we must connect black violence to Whitey failures of leadership.<br>

<p>July 3rd assault victims air criticisms of police at Riverwest meeting</p>
<p>Victims aim criticism at Chief Flynn&rsquo;s police force</p>
<p>Jeremy Ross FOX6 Reporter</p>
<p>9:27 p.m. CDT, July 6, 2011<br>
WITI-TV, MILWAUKEE &mdash; </p>
<p>The victims of the July 3rd attacks speak out at a public meeting in the Riverwest community. The victims were critical of police saying officers made them feel like it was their fault for getting attacked.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn acknowledged during some of the robberies racial slurs were uttered, but quickly added the victims spanned at least four ethnic groups. During the July 6th public meeting he talked about some of the progress in the case, but one group wanted to talk about the police department.</p>
<p>The only part of July 3rd crime spree caught on camera was the looting of a BP gas station on Humboldt and North, other crimes followed the looting. Chief Flynn says, &ldquo;We had a lot of people terrorized we had people robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police say there were at least six armed robberies with at least eleven victims, most around the same time as the looting.</p>
<p>Some residents sat in the Riverwest meeting with emotional scars, others with more obvious signs of trauma. One victim who didn&rsquo;t want to talk to us, showed us her injuries following her assault.</p>
<p>Jessica said, &ldquo;Some of us heard glass break we look up to see the mob converging.&rdquo; Jessica spoke for the victims of the July 3rd attacks. &ldquo;Many of the group did not see the people until they had already been taken by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She described a group of 30 friends leaving a barbeque to watch the fireworks at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Kilbourn Reservoir Park. Chaos followed and in the meeting Jessica accused police of not helping enough. &ldquo;We feel as if the proper measures were not taken and the victims were made to feel at fault, because we were at the wrong place at the wrong time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Flynn says, &ldquo;It certiainly is unacceptable to treat victims witn uncaring behavior or like they don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica said, &ldquo;19 people had stayed at the top of the hill to find stolen possessions, find friends and to give statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flynn responded, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not likely to take 19 separate statements about a single crime given our other obligations at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief Flynn said the department will look into the complaints. &ldquo;If there is a general sense that this district is undeserving then we need to know more about it &ldquo;</p>

By Patrik Jonsson, Staff writer / September 13, 2010<br>
 <br>
The much-studied links between poverty and crime rates – which helped give rise to many Great Society programs – have not materialized so far in the Great Recession. Even with 15 percent of Americans now officially poor, both violent crime and property crime continued to drop in the United States in 2009, the FBI reported Monday&hellip;<br>
 <br>
The report marks the third straight year of falling crime rates – a period that roughly overlaps with the recession.<br>
 <br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/UxiMg" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/UxiMg</a><br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  - </p>
<p>I have not been able to find information about the crime rate during 2010 and 2011. I suspect the crime rate has continued to decline. <br>
 <br>
Crime is a serious problem, and not one to be solved by social reform and social welfare spending. That was tried during the 1960s. It failed. The crime rate has declined since 1980 largely because the prison population has tripled. <br>
 <br>
We should not become hysterical and adopt radical policies. We should continue to do what we have been doing: increase the severity and likelihood of punishment. <br>
 <br>
American Renaissance performs a valuable service by propagating information about crime, and especially black crime. Nevertheless, things are getting better. Fewer criminals are planning their next crime. More are cooling their heels in prison. </p>

		<p>I live in Milwaukee myself and i grew up on the northside, in a mainly black area. it was racist enough where we had some people spray-paint &#8220;i hate white people&#8221; outside of our house and where I was punched in the face from behind while I was walking home one night. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t fall from the punch and the coward ran away and didn&rsquo;t come back, although I waited for him. </p>
<p>This is a conflict for me  &mdash;   I have black friends who would not dream of doing this sort of stuff, yet i see some entitled little ghetto brats get away with this and honestly it makes me want to hurt somebody, though not at random. Something needs to change and it won&rsquo;t be through saying &#8220;hey, let&rsquo;s sit down and talk to this out,&#8221; because the reasonable black people who would like to sit down and talk are not the ones out doing this stuff.<br>
 <br>
I don&rsquo;t understand why none of these guys punched back. It makes my blood boil and frankly I worry if i&rsquo;m going to be able to keep my cool or not. </p>

		<p>Yes, this infuriated me.  I grew up in Milwaukee and was actually on that side of town when all this crap happened.  This does not surprise me one bit.  There are so many news stories that happen like this here in Milwaukee that never make the news.  The white people here are like the Jews that stayed in Nazi Germany, not believing what other Jews were saying.  WAKE UP WHITE PEOPLE! SMELL THE COFFEE AND DO SOMETHING FOR REAL &#8220;CHANGE&#8221;.</p>

		<p>What exactly does Chief Flynn mean by sensationalizing this story?  Could it be that the very mention of blacks earns the accusation.  I notice that he never mentioned the word blacks even though it was exclusively black carnage on others.  His officers had been following this large group of people who had multiple intergroup fights for some time.  Ordinarily they will break up any group that they don&rsquo;t want around with the flimsiest of reasons, but they don&rsquo;t break up this group that has been repetedly menacing that night.  Political fears of a weak and pathetic police chief.  You don&rsquo;t break up a group like this?  What?!!!.  He said that officers took information from victims, when multiple victims said they did not.  There were no reports that they took info from anyone.  He talked about fights, but I didn&rsquo;t hear him say assault.  Why do the words imcompetence and malfeasance come to mind?  This guy seems to regard honesty as a vice.</p>

		<p>Somewhere here on AmRen is an article by a teacher who taught for a long time in a majority black school and wrote about his experiences with the trials and disappointments of attempting to educate blacks who look perennially upon white education and culture as though it was an insult to their own.</p>
<p>In it, he specifically mentions the ability of black young men to become violent with each other at the drop of a hat _over nothing_.  How they can be seemingly happy go lucky and laid back with their friends one moment and absolutely ruthless, beating each other with full force punches, kicks and takedowns, the next.  And absolutely no lead-up to indicate why.</p>
<p>And then &#8216;the switch goes back to off&rsquo; and they are as completely innocent of seeming intent as they ever were of motive.</p>
<p>Point Being: because blacks are physically very adept with major edges in heavy, fast-twitch muscle density and reaction times (from having that massive testosterone edge); there is a spatial danger zone around a white or group of whites which they cannot be allowed into without assuming the worst and taking the initiative away as a proven readiness to hit first.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t have to mean violence but it does imply a solid &#8216;defensive shutout&rsquo; stance so that any black which thinks there is an exploitable weakness of intimidation factor or laziness, is quickly convinced otherwise.  Where blacks come together, this shutout effect needs to be even harder and further away, focussed on the whole group.</p>
<p>I believe it was Livingston of Stanley and Livingston fame who eventually coined the descriptive analogy: half devil, half child.  And the _absolute_ need to never be in a position where you were subordinate or at risk to any black person&rsquo;s ability to flip that switch from resting to full go-mode.</p>
<p>Because they would, just to see if they could.  And you would never survive your weakness.</p>
<p>This from a man who dedicated his life to trying to bring Western Culture to the wilds of Africa.  And ended up very frustrated and Awakened by his failures.</p>

He had aspirations of becoming a hip hop musician and was loved by his family and friends.&#8221; Then it will become clear he was killed over a drug deal or some gang related activity and the detectives will chime in with &#8220;I don&rsquo;t agree with his lifestyle but he didn&rsquo;t deserve to die like this, we&rsquo;re gonna catch this guy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking from the blue collar perspective that I was raised in I can honestly say that myself and everyone I grew up with has had to rise to the occasion more than once and are more than able to do so effectively but we live our lives with self control and the fact that we really want to be peaceful more than at odds with our environment.<br>
Blacks tend to have less self control and an insolent, apathetic outlook towards other living things besides themselves personally and no matter how much testosterone they have flooding their systems how many times do you hear of an individual black attacking anyone without a weapon of some kind? They do these things in packs so that they have each other egging themselves on for confidence.<br>
I think our fuse is fine, we just have the edge of reason and the brains to combat this on a different level, and with all of this new information crawling the internet it won&rsquo;t be long before we have a suitable answer.</p>

		<p>I absolutely agree with &#8220;The Max&#8221; (comment #30)<br>

<p>I would like to add a piece to ponder on a bit further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resignation leads to apathy.<br>
 Apathy leads to inertia.<br>
 Inertia leads to indifference.<br>
 Indifference paralyzes the instinct<br>
 for self-defense, that is, <br>
 the instinct to fight back.&#8221;<br>
