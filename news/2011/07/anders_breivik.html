<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/jul/24/norway-anders-behring-breivik-beliefs">Anders Breivik Is Not Christian but Anti-Islam</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Brown, Guardian (London), July 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who shot dead more than 90 young socialists at their summer camp on Friday after mounting a huge bomb attack on the centre of Oslo, has been described as a fundamentalist Christian. Yet he published enough of his thoughts on the internet to make it clear that even in his saner moments his ideology had nothing to do with Christianity but was based on an atavistic horror of Muslims and a loathing of &#8220;Marxists&#8221;, by which he meant anyone to the left of Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>Two huge conspiracy theories form the gearboxes of his writing. The first is that Islam threatens the survival of Europe through what he calls &#8220;demographic Jihad&#8221;. Through a combination of uncontrolled immigration and uncontrolled breeding, the Muslims, who cannot live at peace with their neighbours, are conquering Europe.</p>
<p>But these ideas, however crazy, are part of a widespread paranoid ideology that links the European and American far right and even elements of mainstream conservatism in Britain.</p>
<p>In an argument on the rightwing Norwegian site Dokument.no, Breivik wrote: &#8220;Show me a country where Muslims have lived at peace with non-Muslims without waging Jihad against the Kaffir (dhimmitude, systematic slaughter, or demographic warfare)? Can you please give me ONE single example where Muslims have been successfully assimilated? How many thousands of Europeans must die, how many hundreds of thousands of European women must be raped, millions robbed and bullied before you realise that multiculturalism and Islam cannot work?&#8221;</p>
<p>He obsessively posted statistics showing the growth of Muslim populations in Lebanon, Kosovo, Kashmir and even Turkey over the centuries in order to demonstrate the same process was under way in Oslo right now, as well as in other European cities.</p>
<p>The second is the idea that the elite have sold out to &#8220;Marxism&#8221;, which controls the universities, the mainstream media, and almost all the political parties, and is bent on the destruction of western civilisation. &#8220;Europe lost the cold war as early as 1950, at the moment when we allowed Marxists/anti-nationalists to operate freely, without keeping them out of jobs where they could seize power and influence, especially teaching in schools and universities,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>These two grand conspiracies are linked by the &#8220;Eurabia&#8221; conspiracy theory, which holds that EU bureaucrats have struck a secret deal to hand over Europe to Islam in exchange for oil.</p>
<p>Such extreme ideas are distributed among far-right blogs in Europe and America. The American anti-Muslim agitator Robert Spencer was namechecked when Breivik listed his intellectual influences on Dokument.no, along with a pseudonymous Norwegian who calls himself Fjordman and the equally pseudonymous Bat Ye&rsquo;or, who invented the Eurabia conspiracy. Spencer, along with his sidekick, Pamela Geller, was responsible for the campaign against the so-called &#8220;Ground Zero Mosque&#8221;. He has also been invited to speak in Sweden by the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrat party.</p>
<p>Fjordman, who may be several people writing under a pseudonym, is at least one Norwegian Islamophobe who has for years been predicting civil war between Muslims and their neighbours. He is sufficiently paranoid that he refused to meet Breivik, according to these papers, but their ideas overlap so much that Fjordman was briefly and wrongly suspected of being the gunman. He has also written for the Brussels Journal, a fanatically anti-EU blog where Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, was on the masthead for a while.</p>
<p>Obviously these people cannot be held responsible for the use to which their ideas were put. No matter how deranged a killer&rsquo;s ideas, he still needs a deranged personality to put them into action. But anyone tempted to take them seriously should consider what were almost Breivik&rsquo;s last words on Document.no: &#8220;For the last three years I have been working full time on a cultural conservative work which will help to develop and market these political ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>That &#8220;cultural conservative work&#8221; was the PDF he mailed out as he set off on his murder spree.</p>

What slanted writing, calling an absolutely legitimate fear &#8220;crazy&#8221; and &#8220;paranoid&#8221;.  I assume that Andrew Brown has no such fear - so perhaps we should call him an &#8220;ostrich&#8221;, with his head in the sand.</p>

		<p>Personally, I believe this guy&rsquo;s actions were a false flag attack.</p>
<p>First, a genuine white nationalist will never, ever kill a fellow white.  If he is maniacally against multiculturalism, he will fire on those that represent it (either the people that benefit from the policy or the policymakers (to me, the latter are the only ones that should be viewed as representatives)).  This guy attacked children so the &#8220;official&#8221; storyline contradicts itself.</p>
<p>Second, the DHS recently put out a video that shows middle class, white Americans to be the next wave of terrorists.  We are being targeted out in the open because whites are the only group, by and large, who see what&rsquo;s going on and are attempting to stop it.</p>
<p>Expect more of this type of attack in the future, even here in the U.S.!  My only suggestion to the average white American who isn&rsquo;t already awake is open your eyes!!!<br>

		<p>Anyone that goes on a killing spree of White people, especially children,  regardless of ideology or motive can&rsquo;t be called pro-White or pro-Western. It is anti-White act on it&rsquo;s face. </p>
<p>I see this as an act of an anti-White fascist. </p>
<p>Why is it that that a few meaningless internet posting is what determines his &#8220;ideology&#8221; rather than his actions. Is there really any security on the Internet. I really think it takes more than Internet postings to determine an individual&rsquo;s true motivations. All of the &#8220;mass killings&#8221; that I can think of here in the US where the motives are known involved things or activities outside of Internet posting. </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we allow the persons most prominent actions carry the greatest weight in determining his motives and associated ideologies? Because of our failing to do this Blacks here in the US get away with horrendous hate crimes against white people all the time. Why, because they didn&rsquo;t use some magical words while killing someone. Look at the interracial crime rates in the US the hatred that blacks have for White people is clear but because they did say some magical words at the time is not a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;. </p>
<p>Forget the fact that they are killing Whites in record numbers, we &#8220;need&#8221; certain words to be said or Internet posting to determine motivation. What does it say about us when we can&rsquo;t let the actions speak for themselves??  </p>

		<p>After absorbing a good deal of information about him (BTW, even though his name is plainly listed here, I won&rsquo;t ever state his name in a public forum, for the same reason I will never state the Nutbar of Tucson&rsquo;s name in a public forum, because they were both publicity seekers), I was trying to rack my brain trying to figure out who he would be if you translated his views word for word iota for iota onto the American body politic.</p>

		<p>Get set for more like this.  Anders Breivik is a great example of a Christian Conservative who was not willing to act diplomatically or persevere in using reason, even demonstrations, a tool the Left has used for decades to influence public opinion, and instead acted out a preemptive fantasy that no sane person can support.</p>
<p>I have written many time before on Amren posting blogs that all we can do is act defensively.  In any case, going so far to the right as to become like what you deplore is not going gain one recruit to the cause of white race preservation or race realism.  In fact, it may scare some away.  This man was so deeply into Medieval Christian imagery that I can only imagine a victory for him also would mean wiping out every person who is not ready to pledge allegiance to Jesus Christ and his religion, in its most onerous interpretation.</p>
<p>We must use our heads, be prepared, and if we want to be more than a very small faction of any population, ready to embrace a more philosophical view of what it means to be white.</p>
<p>This man reminds me of the old Eagles song, &#8220;Take it Easy.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s an apropo line, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy.&#8221;  Anders became so myopic that he envisioned himself as a hero, making the first move in a civil war that very few are ready to take part in.</p>
<p>Whether Anders&rsquo; actions will  cause the discussion of Islam in Europe to be enlarged to encompass the concerns of indigenous Europeans is doubtful.  Events like this are too easily demonized by the very system it seeks to expose as the oppressor.  Anders&rsquo; calculations were not only distorted and poorly aimed, his idea that this will help white Europe is a tragic miscalculation.</p>

<p>And having written my previous post, this is a statement that the author that Andrew Brown lets slip.  Anyone who looks at the history of the spread of Islam and its mechanism would have to come to similar conclusions that Anders made.  It is possible to see the cause for alarm without endorsing his personal method of dealing with it.</p>
<p>We are indeed in troubled times.</p>

		<p>I tend to agree with this poster below on this same subject from Friday. I don&rsquo;t trust ANY government/media&rsquo;s version and I am leery of fake documents being put forth. Our enemy will do ANYTHING to silence WHITE conservatives/Christians the world over and we all know it will be through deceit and downright lies.<br>

<p>Well, if the MSM lost their &ldquo;great white defendent&rdquo; Straus-Kahn, then they&rsquo;ve rediscovered him in this guy</p>
<p>olewhitelady</p>
<p>Staus-Kahn was not a &ldquo;great white defendant (sic)&rdquo;. If he were, he would not be walking free.</p>
<p>I read on an NBC website that the attacker described himself on a Facebook page, as &lsquo;Single&rsquo;, &lsquo;Christian&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Conservative&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You need to check the links provided by #33 Anon, the Facebook page is very suspicious:</p>
<p>Our PDF printout from the Facebook profile was done Jul 23 01:39 GMT, and the profile was deleted soon afterwards by Facebook, so how was a detained Anders Behring Breivik able to change it?&hellip;My money is on DHS asking Facebook for a favor</p>
<p>1: Why is there a version of Anders Behring Breivik&rsquo;s Facebook profile not showing Christian / Conservative? Even Google&rsquo;s cache of the Facebook profile retrieved on Jul 22, 2011 23:52:36 GMT supports this factor.</p>
<p>2: How was Christian / Conservative added prior to the profile being removed from Facebook? If our PDF was printed out/saved at Jul 23 01:39 GMT, and the profile was deleted soon afterwards by Facebook, how was a detained Anders Behring Breivik able to change it?</p>
<p>3: Which then needs to be asked, Who had access to in changing the Profile before it was removed?</p>
<p>The media is already spouting off the &ldquo;official&rdquo; not-to-be-questioned version of this incident. The entire massacre was thought up and &ldquo;executed&rdquo; by a lone wolf, right-wing, blond-haired, blue-eyed, Christian Conservative.</p>
<p>But&hellip;if he were motivated by right-wing ethnic nationalism, why would he target young people of his own ethnic/racial group? No one views killing of young people as legitimate, they are never appropriate targets despite it being a camp for Labor party youth.</p>
<p>As #31 flyingtiger states above: Keep an open mind on this one.<br>
And ask: Cui Bono?</p>

		<p>The media is neglecting to give Breivik any credit by way of substantiating his accusation of a Marxist grip on power.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Labour Party has ruled Norway like a one party state for most of the last century.  They have deep ties to international socialism and a history of attempted mergers with communists.</p>
<p>This is no &#8216;conspiracy theory&rsquo;, but a fact. Their youth wing was an incubator for future Labour party members and leaders, to carry on Labour policies well into this century.</p>

		<p>Anders Breveik is indeed not a Christian, but not in the way Andrew Brown is saying.  There is nothing in the New Testament about exclusivity for any national or racial group and Jesus supposedly (Paul really) ordered the conversion of the &#8220;entire world.&#8221;  What Anders is doing is what all Conservative Christians typically do; They pervert the overlaid Christianity on a deeper and natural culture of survival of the tribe and people when being invaded by strangers.  The governments in the West have said that this invasion is legal and that indigenous whites must be welcoming and have worked to harness Christian values in calling on the tolerance of that faith because ultimately, they cannot fathom a heaven filled only with white people.  And that is the trick.</p>
<p>Write you government, demonstrate, speak and reason the case.  Blowing up buildings, killing people, and slaughtering children will NEVER gain one step.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what planet you are living on Andrew Brown, but these ideas you call crazy are taking place even as we speak, and for you to deny it makes YOU look, well, a little loony yourself.</p>
<p>What this man has done is beyond horrible and tragic, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. However, if people like you would just be honest, you know what he says is 100% true.</p>
<p>The tragic irony is that this man resorted to the same level of senseless violence that the Muslims he claims to hate are famous for, against his own people it appears. That&rsquo;s the real tragedy here.</p>

		<p>Regarding the muslim demographic explosion and their general hatred toward non-muslims, the author of this piece says:</p>
<p>&#8220;But these ideas, however crazy&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>The ideas aren&rsquo;t crazy. They are true, and they are being made reality right now. However, the ideas have been expressed by that madman, and so now any time a sane person points out the need to stop the third world from flooding Europe, that person will be connected with the shooter and any debate will end immediately.</p>
<p><br>
Is it a coincidence that this happens as parts of Europe are reconsidering giving muslims the red carpet? It&rsquo;s almost as though this whole thing is a setup and that guy&rsquo;s ideology was faked. Could he be a deep cover muslim or leftist?<br>

		<p>What Brevik did is unforgivable.  A huge atrocity.</p>
<p>Why he did it is perfectly understandable, I even agree with him on muslims and immigration.  There aren&rsquo;t many nordic types and it wouldn&rsquo;t take much of an influx of 3rd worlders to eradicate them, genetically speaking.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t his views, it&rsquo;s that he thought he could advance them on a wider stage by killing children.  Disgusting.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even more disgusting is how the far-left is using this as an attempt to gain even more support for their &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; that caused this to happen in the first place.  They keep shouting those of us who have no interest in their warped social engineering down as &#8216;nazis&rsquo; and &#8216;racists,&rsquo; without realizing that this is exactly what drove Brevik to do what he did in the first place.</p>
<p>When you ban rational discussion, you leave determined men like this with only one recourse.  Which all the world just saw the results of. </p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that in this particular article, the person writing fails to actually refute Brevik&rsquo;s &#8220;paranoid ideology&#8221; of muslim demographics in Europe.  You would think that something so &#8216;crazy&rsquo; and &#8216;silly&rsquo; would be amazingly easy to refute, would you not?</p>

You have given the LEFT just one more piece of ammo to use against us. How could you shoot these kids who were begging for their lives?

<p>I knew they would shift the blame onto U.S. conservatives somehow.</p>
<p>&#8220;huge conspiracy theories&hellip;that Islam threatens the survival of Europe&#8221;</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories?  Like the ones where reptiles control the world from underground caves?  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that statistical facts and proof in history do not create conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Tell that to the ghost of Charles Martel.  Actually, anyone that ever lived throughout time before the 1960&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such extreme ideas are distributed among far-right blogs in Europe and America&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently looking at statistics and having an elementary knowledge of European history can make you have extreme thoughts.  In fact, you need neither, you just need to be around them and see how they act and what they say.  They make no attempt to hide their intentions.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the European race is doomed through a mental defect, since it seems to be universal.  And don&rsquo;t say that the majority do not think that way, it is irrelevant if they do not have a voice and use it (another flaw of whites that is unknown to all others).</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamophobe who has for years been predicting civil war between Muslims and their neighbours&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes it is crazy to think that what has happened every time in the past under similar circumstances will happen again in the present and future.  It also will make you extreme, a conspiracy theorist, intolerant, racist (even though islam is a religion), and apparently a republican.</p>
<p>Civil war is inevitable.  I just hope it happens sooner rather than later.  The longer we wait the worse our chances are of winning.</p>

		<p>I have a strange feeling that something is not right about this case.</p>
<p> We all know there is a big movement to shut down any White racialist sites and speech. We also know that anti-immigrant feelings are growing in all once White nations (for a very good and legitimate reason).We hear constantly about all the anti-semitism growing in Europe and America and it makes me wonder about the &#8220;descriptions and ideology&#8221; they give to this guy. Of course they say he was anti-semitic, anti-immigration so this gives them more ammunition to curtail all us &#8220;haters&#8221; (Whites, that is) any free speech or communication with each other, as it will be deemed racist and hate.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget what the DHS put out not long ago about us WHITES who are more likely to be the terrorists.  Seems very convenient for this to happen soon after and by a &#8220;White&#8221; guy at that&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Here is an excerpt from a children&rsquo;s book that I read on Occidental Dissent today. I read the book to my daughters when they were young, but I never realized that it was more than a story for children until this afternoon.</p>
<p><br>
Darzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more than one idea at a time in his head; and just because he knew that Nagaina&rsquo;s children were born in eggs like his own, he didn&rsquo;t think at first that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible bird, and she knew that cobra&rsquo;s eggs meant young cobras later on; so she flew off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some ways.<br>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t kid yourself about the Christian angle. I&rsquo;ve been waiting a long time to hear a Christian leader say the religion is true and special compared to Islam. Readers should observe for this. It becomes obvious very quickly that Christian leaders can&rsquo;t say it. Hmmmm. We in the west have a long history of famous predictions by atheists about the end of religion in Europe; Marx, Nietzsche, Russell, and recently Hitchens and Dawkins. So we actually could be witnessing the extinction of Christianity in Europe. Of course it looks different than we had expected. The lessons of history are not obvious. So we need a name for this coyness by Christian leaders. Then we can all talk about it among ourselves as a problem issue for white people. Christian coyness?</p>

		<p>Two huge conspiracy theories form the gearboxes of his writing. The first is that Islam threatens the survival of Europe through what he calls &ldquo;demographic Jihad&rdquo;. Through a combination of uncontrolled immigration and uncontrolled breeding, the Muslims, who cannot live at peace with their neighbours, are conquering Europe.</p>

<p>Of course the actions of this man are very wrong.  It is no doubt brought about by total frustration with the political leadership, the media and the voting public.  There appears to not be a democratic alternative where those with evil public policy will be removed by vote. </p>
<p>My assessment is that he is trying to remove some political leaders and those in the youth movement that are in favor or immigration and islam.  Indiscriminate killing of innocent people cannot be justified as a means to an end.</p>
<p>In my opinion the responsibility for the deaths is with the political leadership of Norway that has for many years now embraced an immigration policy that ultimately brings an end to Norway as we once knew it.</p>
<p>This act of killing is senseless as is the act of bringing untold millions of third worlders into Norway.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the immigration problem is so far advanced that the host will likely become extinct.  The leadership necessary to make corrections does not appear to be moving up and the electorate vote necessary to support removal of the third worlders is also an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>This massacre is a huge trajedy in Norweigan history, but it will be very small when the final result of the immigration of third worlders is complete.</p>
<p>If this event does not wake up the Norweigan public, nothing will.</p>

		<p>What he did was horrific beyond words, however, he is correct about the ruling elite of his country forcing an alien, non integrating, LESSER people on the native population. Muslims, by their very definition, have no place in a modern, humanist, democratic society. I disagree his actions will further the lie of multiculturalism, on the contrary,( thanks to that wonderful white western invention, the internet) it has made regular folks wonder about the agenda being pushed on them by their elected officials. Islam does not work in a European context, Muslims do not integrate, this has been proved time and time again.</p>

		<p>The attacks in Norway seem strange, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they turned out to be another false flag attack. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that one man managed to kill over 90 people by himself, and even more surprising that he wasn&rsquo;t killed in the process. And there were the earlier reports that a Muslim group took credit for the attacks. </p>
<p>What the attacks in Norway have produced is a white, homegrown terrorist. Before the attacks, one of the main criticisms against much of the anti-terror efforts was that they were directed towards people who were unlikely to be terrorists. This case will be used to promote the idea that anybody can be a terrorist, and to keep taking away peoples&rsquo; rights. It will also be used to promote the idea that people with politically-incorrect views are potential terrorists.</p>

Stupid, irrational, and violent actions like Breivik&rsquo;s will offend the average law-abiding white citizen, and turn them against sensible nationalism and any rational restrictions on immigration.

But there&rsquo;s this neat little thing in Norway (and the United States) called the political process.  Frustrating as it can be most of the time, and as difficult a haul as it is for those of us who hold viewpoints outside the overton window (the sociological concept, not the Glenn Beck book), it is a way to change things without killing people.</p>

Anders is crazy and wrong. However, he is right that Islam is a scourge and a demographic warfare against the rest of humanity.<br>
In the same Norway barely a week before Anders finally snapped, a 15 year old Muslim immibrant raped a 20 year old Norwegian girl in broad daylight ON THE STEPS OF THE BUILDING OF PARLIAMENT. This is the typical muslim demonstration of domination and conquest of native populations. Raping her on the steps of the parliament is a symbolic act of contempt for the host by the parasitic jihadist muslim. Nothing happened to the rapist. Not only that, a group of security operatives nearby watched and even filmed the whole thing without lifting a finger to defend one of their own females against an alien rapist. Such a system need to be broken down and radically destroyed. Anders was right in that. His method  though appropriately radical, was wrong.<br>

<p>Read his published manifesto. </p>
<p>The shooter published a 1,510 page manifesto entitled, &ldquo;2083: A European Declaration of Independence&#8221; in which he listed the EDL several times. He attacked the Norwegian ruling party which had just signed a document on Monday July 18, 2011, that legitimised the Palestinian nation by the recognition of a Palestinian ambassador. The children or youth branch of that Norwegian ruling party had held up banners demanding Palestinian national recognition and a boycott of Israel. He shot them.</p>
<p>Police initially believed he acted alone but did not rule out the possibility of an accomplice. During interrogation, he claimed that there were two cells of extremists who had aided him. Probably one who bombed the building, and another cutting off transporation to the island.<br>

		<p>I think the main issue with regard to Breivik has been completely ignored up to this point.  One that has the most serious repercussions for whites, not in its argument but in its implications.</p>
<p>I think the point was expressed best in a comment made by none other than Yggdrasil on Occidental Dissent.  White people are deeply conflicted about the morality of this event while Yggdrasil cuts through that anxiety and rhetoric to get to the real heart of the matter.  One which no government, no white nationalist and certainly, no liberal would be wise to ignore.  Breivik has caused a fundamental change in the war against whites.</p>

<p>Is this the very first time that a gathering of leftists in a Western Nation, post 1960, has been made to pay the ultimate price for their anti democratic multicultural impositions?</p>
<p>If so, then I suspect that the pictures of dead young adults will have a rather powerful deterrent effect on parents who might otherwise encourage their kids to be leftists?</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a more powerful and socially compelling deterrent than to inject the sort of horrific risk that these pictures implant into the minds of multiculturally inclined parents .</p>
<p>Viewed without emotion, this incident implies a multi-layered level of calculation that I find quite remarkable – an example not to be emulated to be sure – but remarkable nonetheless.</p>
<p>Thus far, Islamic terrorism has been confined to sub-way commuters in Spain, Street car commuters in Britain, and primarily, office workers in Manhattan – all nobodies that the elites could, quite frankly, care less about losing.</p>
<p>All that the Islamic terror attacks carried out on average working stiffs accomplished was to generate broad popular support for the war on terror and the vast increase in budgets for the security state. In short, their targeting was terrible as they never terrorized the elites responsible for their grievances.</p>
<p>This attack was entirely different, as it appears designed to inject an element of extreme risk into volunteering to join the ranks of the multicultural political elite.</p>
<p>Further, the soft sort of totalitarianism of the Frankfurt School variety that is spreading throughout the West is carefully designed to avoid pushing its victims over the edged to the kind of violent reaction that occurred in Norway.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism was supposed to be something you could impose on the proles without any cost!</p>
<p>This attack seems to be a rather remarkable demonstration that the velvet glove totalitarianism that we all live under has failed in its primary mission to keep the elites safe from harm. What are they going to do? Have platoons of guards armed with automatic rifles patrolling the campus of Harvard to protect the future elites from the townies?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a bit obvious?</p>
<p>After Norway hasn&rsquo;t the task of obliterating the White race become a bit more &ldquo;messy&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The analogies of Hunter and others to the killings commanded by Bush and Western butchers are apt, but miss the point. This job had the kind of purposefulness that one would expect from a state planned attack, not an attack prompted by the rage of some lone nutter.</p>
<p>It hit the aspiring elites were it hurts, in their training camp for future leaders, and it hit the proud, self righteous multi-culti parents where it hurts as well.</p>
<p>It revealed the soft underbelly of the multicultural regime for all to see.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I feel sad for the parents and relatives of these dead young adults. After all most were lured into a wildly risky scheme of Quisling oppression of their fellow countrymen thinking that the enterprise was riskless and profitable.</p>
<p>But putting on the cap of an intelligence analyst, I see a picture of profound significance and meaning, one sure to be a major turning point.<br>

		<p>Diversity is a strength. </p>
<p>Most of the time that phrase is just a euphemism spouted by a mendacious liberal seeking to shield themselves from scrutiny; most often from a tenured humanities or social sciences professor or politician.</p>
<p>However, I DO think there are ways that there is some truth to this. </p>
<p>Many of the world&rsquo;s worst conflicts involve groups that are alike, not groups that are radically different. </p>
<p>Take the Pakistanis and the Indians: one culture, two countries. The &#8216;differences&rsquo; between these groups is a purely artificial religious difference.  </p>
<p>Or take the conflict in Northern Ireland: the two sides are so close as to be even genetically indistinguishable. </p>
<p>Or take last weekend&rsquo;s massacre. The perpetrator did not seek out people who are different than himself, but rather those who are most alike. </p>
<p>The first murder, the bible teaches us, didn&rsquo;t occur between strangers, but when one brother killed another for the favor of a common God. </p>
<p>This is why, ultimately, equality itself may be dangerous   &mdash;   and may perhaps explain why movements that seek equality sink into bloodshed. </p>
<p>If we make ourselves too much alike, the differences that keep us from being close rivals disappear, and the result is violence. </p>
<p>Okay, my thinking on this is not fully formed here, but I believe Jared Taylor deserves a thoughtful and searching answer to his question: how, exactly, is diversity a strength. </p>
<p>I strongly suspect that in some ways diversity really can be a strength, but chiefly be in ways that will deeply disturb those who spout the phrase most often. </p>

What I don&rsquo;t understand is how someone who is against the Islamification of the west would decide to target a group of largely white, native-born children; even if they were liberals, pro-Palestinian, and inclusive of non-whites. I don&rsquo;t understand how anyone could believe this would inspire average people to join your cause. </p>
<p>It was first reported that Breivik said he did this on his own. Next it was reported that he told his lawyer that &ldquo;he was part of an anti-Islam network that had two cells in Norway and several more abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was also reported that &ldquo;Mr Lippestad also said that his client had used &#8220;some kind of drugs&#8221; before the crime.&rdquo; </p>
<p>(Berserkers:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker</a> )</p>
<p>BBC Report: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3lstwaa" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3lstwaa</a></p>
<p>Which is it?</p>
<p>If he did conspire with people abroad, who were they and what was their objective? To start an anti-Islam campaign throughout Europe by killing children (as Mr. Breivik claimed was his objective) or to trick someone with a weak mind and supplying him with drugs to carry out their plan to discredit any and all right-wing, nationalist groups? </p>
<p>Normally I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist. However, both McVeigh and Breivik seemed to carry out actions that were at odds with their stated goals (to call attention to a tyrannical government in the case of McVeigh and to inspire an anti-Islamic crusade in Europe as in the case of Breivik).</p>
<p>Targeting children, even liberal children, is not going to win you widespread support. Only a madman (or a patsy) could reason in such a way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll ever uncover the truth behind this crime since there is much conflicting information and disinformation being disseminated.<br>

<p>Will his strategic strike work? Probably not since the Left controls the Media and the Media is adept at spinning things anyway they want. And let&rsquo;s face it - you don&rsquo;t need much spin on this one. But he has gotten people talking, his writings are available, he&rsquo;s going to talk in court - and his statistics and conclusions are correct. He will open a few minds. Remember, most people are already against us and unless they think freely, they always will be. Weak, unformed, and uninformed minds are just waiting for the Media Wolf to think for them. </p>
<p>Check out his slide show if you don&rsquo;t feel like wading thru the book. On one slide he says it&rsquo;s already too late to stop the invasion democratically. I fear he is correct about this as well.</p>

<p>Ironically, you followed that up by mentioning that other curious character.  For the sake of this discussion, I&rsquo;m going to assume that the official story re OKC is true, even though I really don&rsquo;t, I think OKC was a Ramzi Yousef job, and Clinton covered up that evidence because he wanted to broker a Middle East peace agreement to get himself a Nobel Peace Prize.  But drawing on that assumption, if you want to believe the curious character bombed the Murrah Bldg. as revenge for Waco &amp; Ruby Ridge, then from a functional standpoint, it was stupid because Murrah, like any other Federal building in any city with an appreciable black population, was host to mostly black bureaucrats.  They&rsquo;re problematic enough for other reasons, but black affirmative action paper pusher bureaucrats and building janitors didn&rsquo;t gas the children of the Branch Davidian complex nor assassinate Randy Weaver&rsquo;s wife, kids and dog in cold blood.</p>

		<p>People are saying that this man is not WN because he killed whites.  But liberal marxist whites are the main threat to whites.  Yes I know, the irony.  The people he killed are the future of the Labour Party in Norway.  I think he was trying to take the &#8220;head&#8221; off the monster.  Still it is a tragedy as he himself is the product of a liberal family!  Many of those kids could have seen the &#8220;light&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Anyone ever give it a thought that Breivik killed alot of White people at the labor camp so no one could claim he was a &#8220;racist&#8221;..i mean many White people,both on the left,middle and right of things will go to great lenghths to prove they arent racist..even being supportive of policys that commit genocide on their own race..Breivik from what i have been able to ascertain from reading many articles is pro-gay,anti-racist,atheist,..hardly what you would label someone being on the extreme right..yeh,he probably targeted all those White people  for execution to assauge his guilt-ridden conscience that he wasnt doing this atrocious,evil act against humankind because he was a racist but because he disliked a certain religion..i have read where he claimed he had many &#8220;muslim friends&#8221; and whom he still respected.This crazy madman syndrome is what can happen when Whites have lost their White Identity.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Brevik did is unforgivable. A huge atrocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far about 40,000 white people - which includes the nearly 4,000 Afrikaner farmers - have been randomly and motivelessly slain and brutally slaughtered by black &#8220;criminals&#8221; since black majority rule &#8220;freedom&#8221; came to South Africa in 1994.</p>
<p>Would you consider that an unforgiveable atrocity?</p>
<p>People in the west are barely aware that this daily slaughter goes on<br>
Were it not for blogs like Amren even fewer people would know.</p>
<p>For those that are not up to speed with the British media The Guardian is probably the most left wing liberal daily mainstream broadsheet newspaper published. It also probably has the smallest circulation. This article is the classic example of the left wielding a disproportionate influence over the minds of the public.</p>

<p>Your assertion is nonsense.  I am NOT a Freemason, but I studied it for many years and accumulated many of its official texts, including some rare 19th century manuals and even regalia.  I found the history involved fascinating.  I also helped a certain author in Southern Europe produce the first book on FM in a certain nation, where FM had long been banned by the RCC, largely because FM was founded by resistors of The Inquisition and were largely Protestants.  During my decade long study I did meet both Catholic and Jewish Masons (In America).  San Francisco has a lodge that is full of Chinese members, but I don&rsquo;t know what religion they tend to follow as individuals.  In that case, I thought that FM there had been co-opted into a Chinese community service organization.  Do I need to mention that most of the Founding Fathers including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin were Freemasons? Do I need to mention that much of our Constitution is based on Masonic protocols?</p>
<p>FM is officially opened to one of any faith, as long as they believe in God in the paternal sense.  You must be a citizen in good standing with no criminal record or socially disgraceful reputation.  It is not a religion, but a fraternity that you might call a &#8220;congress of religions&#8221; aimed at finding the positive elements in religious spirituality for building an improving the individual.  IN reality, it most often attracts moderate Protestants.  FM might be rightly accused of inadvertently practicing &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; but that&rsquo;s about it.  </p>
<p>The problem people like you have with FM is simply that once accepted in as Entered Apprentices, Fundamentalist Christians are instructed to tolerate other outlooks, something they cannot do as fundamentalists.  They lose if they object, so they next go about attempting to expose FM as a kind of anti-American conspiracy theory, or even a link to the long thoroughly debunked fraud known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Accepting these ridiculous propositions as factual requires the suspension of logic, Ignoring established history and ready counter examples, and a highly selective reading of controversial events of for example; an Italian FM lodge that was taken over by the Mafia and used to make deals with The Vatican in money laundering and criminal activities.  The infamous &#8220;Illuminatti&#8221; conspiracy theory only has a link to FM in that Adam Weishaupt was first a German FM who was actually expelled for interpreting and acting as a Mason by forming a separate, violent cell bent of revolution in Germany in 1776.  Many purveyors of trash novels used this plot for fiction writing in the 19th century, which is also where The Protocols got their start, by a Christian author in Switzerland.  Since there is no central government in FM, it is possible for any lodge anywhere to become more identified with local politics than act in unison with say, The Grand Lodge in London.  Members are on their honor to adhere to certain humanitarian and basic religious principals and the main work is aimed at making the individual a better citizen in the society they live in - PERIOD.  </p>
<p>At the end of WW2, between 1940 and 1965, there were more Freemasons in America than any other or all other fraternal organizations put together.  It is the oldest, and the historically richest in history and achievements.  Membership in FM has been on the wane in the past few decades and FM has been more lenient in accepting a wider selection of philosophies that can still be interpreted as basically holding a belief in a Supreme Being.  This upsets Christian Fundamentalist applicants and novices who expected to find a secret Christian society to act out some sort of religious fantasy or another.</p>
<p>People who hope to distract others into a personal delusion using easily challenged and debunked arguments is WASTING OUR PRECIOUS TIME.  The actions of this man have set back the real concerns of whites of European descent everywhere, we don&rsquo;t need more divisive nonsense to wade through.  The more we distract ourselves with such nonsense, the less likely a real solution that can help whites will be found or formed.  Going off on tangents against a well known, public service oriented, patriotic organization like FM, with activities comparable and far beyond those of the Boy and Girl Scouts of America, such as the well known, Shriner&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Burn Centers and hospitals.  I have a cousin who is an active FM and a Catholic.  His lodge has been sewing cooling packs for our troops since the problem of heat in Iraq became known. </p>
<p>Anders Breviek used Templar and FM symbols and imagery, but I would bet my next pay check that he is not a member of any FM lodge.  It is actually people who are too fundamentalist Christian to accept FM that tend to be the most violently disposed in proferring solutions.  One interesting read for scholars on these questions is &#8220;The Holy Reich.&#8221;  Christianity has historically been used as a political and martial instrument in Europe and the world, by Popes,Kings,Queens,PMs, and Presidents - as well as fascist dictators.  One must reject most of the known history of the West to deny that.</p>
<p>Breviek was angered that &#8220;atheist&#8221; Marxism was taking over Europe and allowing its Islamization.  That is a well known theme, and while perhaps true, it proves that he was acting out of Christian political concerns, not influenced or as an agent of some imagined militant arm of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t kid yourself about the Christian angle. I&rsquo;ve been waiting a long time to hear a Christian leader say the religion is true and special compared to Islam. Readers should observe for this. It becomes obvious very quickly that Christian leaders can&rsquo;t say it. Hmmmm. We in the west have a long history of famous predictions by atheists about the end of religion in Europe; Marx, Nietzsche, Russell, and recently Hitchens and Dawkins. So we actually could be witnessing the extinction of Christianity in Europe. Of course it looks different than we had expected. The lessons of history are not obvious. So we need a name for this coyness by Christian leaders. Then we can all talk about it among ourselves as a problem issue for white people. Christian coyness?&#8221;</p>
<p>I am one white realist who believes that Christianity gets in the way of white survival.  And I mean Christianity in ANY of its manifestations.  First, Christianity has always been meant to be universal, shared with the world and include the entire world.  Next, the reason is that the amount of logic and common sense that is required to actually believe the Biblical myths (or any religious myth) has to be creating chronic mental health issues.  (Some studies have demonstrated how this works for all &#8220;true believers&#8221;).  The Western mind, with its wonderful tendency toward rational logic and common sense, must endure a sort of schizophrenia to go on for centuries advancing while holding onto such extremes of superstition.  </p>
<p>The hope of the philosopher atheist is not for a liberal-Marxist style outcome, unless they are also a Marxist, (but couldn&rsquo;t be if they were a serious philosopher).  Rather the hope is for a more subtle development for the Western mind in general.  I think that this sort of capacity for more subtle thought is exactly what is needed in finding the path for white survival.  Philosophy such as this is well within the Western Tradtion, going back to Greece, Rome, and throughout European and Western history.  THE PROBLEM is that just when the West was freeing itself from the backward shackles of the church and constrictive thinking in the general population, non-Western, principally Islam (but others too, although in a far less vindictive way), invaded to assert itself in the resultant relaxation of religious fervor that had so long tormented Europe and drove so many Europeans to seek somewhere else to live a better life.</p>
<p>Of course, the big controlling factor in this is the hugely tragic events of the two twentieth century European civil wars.  This is how I have come to view them.  Yes, they spread to the rest of the world, but largely due to European colonial influences and involvements.  The huge drop in European populations due to both those wars left a large manpower shortage.  The rebuilding of Europe required outside labor.  This was the beginning of the process that led to the existential threat to Europe now.  </p>
<p>It seems that in the 20th century and even now, the battle in Europe is between communism and fascism.  Democracy is only an embossing form with this competition underlying.  Having lived as a private citizen in Central Europe, I feel that I had a chance to identify and really notice this problem as more acute than in North America or Australia, for example. </p>
<p>The need to rally the indigenous European population to awaken to itself and its right and need to survive is great.  Some naturally think that Christianity is the cultural rallying point, because they are only superficially informed.  Others think that reviving fanatical Nazism is the way.  Both IMHO are wrong, and tragically so.  Just look at it this way, how does the accepted tome of psychological analysis go?; &#8220;Repeating failed processes hoping for a different outcome is the definition of insanity.&#8221;  And what good does it do to openly push all the buttons that we KNOW will draw a predictable response?  That is what Breviek has done.</p>
<p>I just hope that the West, Europeans in particular still have enough time to discover themselves and demand their recognition and right to their survival and lands.</p>

&#8220;Anders is crazy and wrong. However, he is right that Islam is a scourge and a demographic warfare against the rest of humanity.<br>
In the same Norway barely a week before Anders finally snapped, a 15 year old Muslim immibrant raped a 20 year old Norwegian girl in broad daylight ON THE STEPS OF THE BUILDING OF PARLIAMENT. This is the typical muslim demonstration of domination and conquest of native populations. Raping her on the steps of the parliament is a symbolic act of contempt for the host by the parasitic jihadist muslim. Nothing happened to the rapist. Not only that, a group of security operatives nearby watched and even filmed the whole thing without lifting a finger to defend one of their own females against an alien rapist. Such a system need to be broken down and radically destroyed. Anders was right in that. His method though appropriately radical, was wrong.<br>
Here is the link: <a href="http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2011/07/rape-on-steps-of-parliament.html" rel="nofollow">http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2011/07/rape-on-steps-of-parliament.html&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I read the articles and read some of the comments.  It is unclear whether this 15 year old was her date or not.  Neither she nor her family has made a comment on the incident.  While outrageous and not an excuse for this, even if it is &#8220;merely&#8221; a date rape, the complexities on the comments there go toward the type of society that Feminism and Western society has produced to allow such an outrage to occur, even if both people were full consenting participants.</p>

<p>Hello, hello, for how long and in what extraterrestrial cave have you all been sleeping..?  Even a site as mild mannered as Amren, which carefully screens and zaps a large proportion of our carefully-conposed posts (at least it does mine), is regarded as a &#8220;hate&#8221; site and therefore is banned access to from many public computers.</p>
<p>I dont know if Breiviks extreme tactics will work for us - in the short run I suspect not - but in the medium term who knows?  Aside from too many heavily romanticised images of crusaders on white chargers, his video was extremely well made and given the publicity this has generated could well open a lot of minds. We dont seem to be winning on any other front, so why not change the battlefield and the rules of warfare?  I´m not condoning his actions but just thinking aloud. </p>
<p>As the brilliant Pat Condell always signs off his videos (tongue in cheek)&hellip;. Peace..!   </p>

		<p>51 Whiteplight:  If it wasn&rsquo;t for mass immigration of non-whites and non-Christians onto our lands, I would push hard for atheism along your lines. Instead, I have become a cultural Christian. Partly because of the competition with Islam. Partly because there is not enough time to direct whites away from Christianity. So I will go to some lengths to stand beside white Christians and I expect them to come half way to accept me. If they would stop bringing in African refugees and adopting black babies that would be great. I would sing Praise the Lord to that.</p>
<p>I recall something Pat Buchanan said. Philosphers can be atheists but ordinary folks can&rsquo;t. I have a missionary hobby where I go out to meet whites; bars, lunch counters, bus stops, cigarette areas (I don&rsquo;t smoke but I bring a coffee), cafes, etc. If you frequent a place quite often you&rsquo;ll eventually become acquainted with people. Those that go on the internet, watch TV news, read newspapers and are upset about immigration and crime are good candidates to introduce to our white movement. So far I&rsquo;m up to 116 people. I have copies of AR handy in my car or briefcase. Anyway, to be blunt, these people are not philosophers. It has been a real eye-opener for me getting inside the minds of our people. I don&rsquo;t expect them to become rationalists easily.</p>
<p>Which leads me to talking about fascism. You mentioned communism, fascism and democracy. I am of the belief that all forms of government are fascist. Political debate is about different kinds of fascism. By fascism I don&rsquo;t mean concentration camps, brutal police and intimidation. Fascism can be peaceful. To me it means government manages the population as groups, controls our thinking like the subconscious, controls our culture and religion. This control involves power relationships so there is competition that goes well beyond congress. I strongly encourage whites to do what they can to increase our power. </p>
