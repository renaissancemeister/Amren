<h1>India Offers Prizes to Sterilisation Volunteers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, July 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A district in northern India is offering prizes including television sets, food processors and even a Tata Nano car for people who agree to undergo sterilisation, a doctor told AFP on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to promote sterilisation,&#8221; Pratap Singh Dutter, the deputy chief medical officer of Jhunjhunu district in the north Indian state of Rajasthan, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone who gets sterilised between today and 30 September will be entered into a lottery to win prizes.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt we were falling behind on our sterilisation targets of 21,000 per year, so the district collector came up with this idea. We hope at least 6,000 people will come forward in the next three months to get sterilised,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to census data released in March this year, India&rsquo;s already billion-plus population is set to grow further in the next few decades and become the world&rsquo;s biggest by 2030, surpassing China&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The country has a total fertility rate  &mdash;  the number of children borne on average per woman  &mdash;  of 2.588, according to 2010 figures issued by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past, Indian officials have floated stranger incentives and theories on the best ways to slow down the country&rsquo;s birth rate.</p>
<p>Two years ago Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad suggested that late-night television would act as an effective form of birth control, by lulling people to sleep so they would not produce any children.</p>

		<p>There was an article not too long ago on American Renaissance about the UN&rsquo;s population projections for 2100. Little Nigeria is set to have over 700 million people by the end of this century, which is over half the population of USA right now. The Third World in general doesn&rsquo;t fare much better. Sterilizations for Third World countries are therefore not a bad thing.</p>

		<p>This is sensible and humane.  They have more than enough people and really could do with a drastic population drop.  This is much better than either abortion or infantcide.  The real question is how to keep the sexes in balance.</p>

		<p>I wonder if this is a sign that the top 5% of India, intelligence wise, finally figured out that the bottom 10% popping out 20 kids apiece was a terrible terrible thing?</p>
<p>One can only hope.  Though it won&rsquo;t be an easy task to say the least.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Rushton&rsquo;s comment at an Amren conference about a few people trying to pull a log that 80 others were sitting on.  Not fun at all.</p>

		<p>I would say that every country should offer free sterilization with a hefty cash payment after the second child is born.  In addition, no one may claim any welfare of any kind without agreeing to being sterilized first.</p>

Mike:</p>
<p>Why should that top 5% care?  They&rsquo;ve decamped for England and the US and other White-created countries to race-replace us and steal what we have created.</p>
<p>Would YOU want to live in the civilization that the Indians created for themselves?</p>

<p>Is this such a strange idea?  It sure worked with white people.</p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;d like to make sterilization a requirement for anyone who seeks welfare benefits for a total of more than four years.  Also, welfare benefits for a mother with two or more children should be the same as welfare benefits for a mother with one child.  It is long past time we halted our dysgenic policies.</p>

		<p>Offer $1,000 to any 18 year-old who will be sterilized (also pay the cost of the procedure, of course). Who will be the takers? Those who want something NOW, over having something much later; those who don&rsquo;t embrace the middle class ethos of home, family, and job. Seems to me like exactly the right kind of people would be taking the money&hellip;<br>

The District in North India has come up with a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>In the future, the government should also get involved and promote sterilization as a promise of a better future without stigma.</p>
<p>Sometimes sterilization is just as important as birth.<br>

		<p>I see with sadness that some posters are taking this news at face value. Let us not be fooled by pseudosolutions marketed to the West by cunning Indians.  Offering the prize? To enter into a lottery? How pathetic! I do not remember China coming up with such nonsense like late night tv - what a load of bull. Strict laws enforced by harsh punishment, thats what worked for China and will work for India.  Chinese leaders knew well that breeding is an aggressive biological drive hence aggressive mechanical counter-force is needed to stop it not some nonsense like lottery games or tv watching.  After all we all can see the results in China. And we will see in a few decades how Indians solved their breeding frenzy with their &#8220;ingenious&#8221; solutions.</p>
<p>Let me have my little guess. In a few decades they will have hit 2 bil.,exported 0.2 bil.of their own all round the world ( in other third world countries included!),devoured one third of the worlds natural resources and made the naive West feel completely guilty for Indias &#8220;low CO2 emissions per capita&#8221;.</p>
<p>India keeps coming up with such propaganda only to soothe the West.  Western leaders see well the white elephant on the stage of global problems, and believe me behind the scenes they insist  on India to curb its population but there is no genuine will in Indians to solve their population problem, they prefer to export it.  Deep down the cunning Indians know demography is power!  And in a globalized world demography is a global power!</p>

		<p>  While China has stabilized its population growth, India has not. I believe that Sanjay Gandhi tried a program of sterilization but failed due to both corruption and incompetence. However, Gandhi did recognize the problem and I believe that he was on the right track. India desperately needs to get a handle on its population growth or its only export will be people, Ala Camp of the Saints.</p>

<p>No need to wait a few decades, this experiment is already completed. Back in the &rsquo;60s the Indian government used to give away transistor radios (big novelty then) with sterilizations. We see the effects today. None.</p>
<p>A &#8220;chance to win&#8221; a TV is not going to cut it either.</p>

		<p>This is in effect a form of class warfare whose social-psychology effects are not long-term known.</p>
<p>The poor treat population growth as a kind of megaphone by which the upper classes -must- notice them.  Or be at risk of facing the mob-rule ethos of a Revolutionary France.</p>
<p>As others have said, there is also a significant risk to having gender imbalance (especially critical in India where so many woman are murdered in favor of sons) because you can also be looking at mass disaffection (zero work ethic) and criminality resulting from the loss of the most basic of &#8216;privileges&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On the flip side, are the middle and upper class women who want no part of gestation, birth or rearing, so unless you add massive cash lotteries, egg auctions and other &#8216;Only pale people need apply&hellip;&rsquo; (literally, the opening paragraph for many online and print Indian dating/marital services) incentives, you could easily end up flushing your high-IQ middle class right out of society as well.</p>
<p>Eugenics may be positive or negative and still &#8216;good, overall&rsquo;.  But it has to _conserve_ genetic as well as social value to be effective.  </p>
