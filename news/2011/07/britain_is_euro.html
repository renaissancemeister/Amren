<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More immigrants settle permanently in Britain than any other country in Europe, a study revealed yesterday.</p>
<p>The latest figures showed that 397,900 foreigners decided to live here in 2009  &mdash;  second in the world only to the U.S.</p>
<p>The figure marked a rise of 14 per cent from the previous year. It was the largest increase in the developed world, at a time when most countries saw dramatic falls in the number of permanent settlers.</p>
<p>The study, from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said the increase was largely down to family members coming to stay with those already in Britain, and the large number of foreign students living here.</p>
<p>The study comes just over a week after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said a generation of Britons would be condemned to a life on benefits unless immigration rules were tightened.</p>
<p>He said back-to-work schemes would fail without strict controls on incomers, and called on firms to employ British-born people rather than rely on migrant labour. Business leaders responded to his plea by saying British workers had a poor work ethic compared with those from abroad.</p>
<p>The OECD report, Trends in International Migration, appears to back up the business leaders&rsquo; view. It found Britain is one of the few countries where migrant workers are less likely to end up unemployed than locals. </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the think-tank MigrationWatch UK, said last night the figures proved Labour had made Britain a soft touch for immigration.</p>
<p>&#8216;Labour&rsquo;s loss of control of immigration . . . has left us with a situation where our population is growing at the fastest rate for 50 years,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;The pressure on housing, health and education can only be intensified at a time when Labour left no money to deal with the extra demand.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The OECD report shows Britain is one of the only countries where the level of permanent migration increased in the years after the credit crunch. </p>
<p>The number of permanent migrants here is exceeded only by the U.S., where 1.1million people settled permanently  &mdash;  up 2 per cent on the previous year.</p>
<p>France had only 178,700 new settlers  &mdash;  down 7 per cent  &mdash;  and Germany 197,500, down 13 per cent. In Ireland, the total fell by 42 per cent to 38,900.</p>
<p>The number of people settling in Britain has risen by more than 50 per cent since 2003.</p>
<p>The report by the OECD, which represents developed nations, said: &#8216;Most countries saw declines in permanent migration in 2009, almost half showing falls of 10 per cent or more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It said Britain actually saw a fall of more than a quarter in the number of people coming for work, but the total of permanent settlers went up because those who had moved here on temporary visas opted to stay, &#8216;especially but not exclusively international students&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It added: &#8216;This, along with increases in family migration and in movements for other reasons, more than offset what would have otherwise been a demand-induced decline.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Last night Mr Duncan Smith said: &#8216;This report confirms that even during the recession, jobs in the UK were going to migrant workers while other countries saw a decline in migrant labour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I would too, if I knew my future worth was being undermined by immigration policies designed to keep me on par with the Third World.</p>
<p>I would be tempted to enact my own Cloward Piven plan.  Not cooperating with a system stacked against me makes logical and moral sense.</p>

		<p>I truly think that (former) Great Britain has become a lost cause with the point of no returned being already surpassed. The so-called conservative Party had promised to curb immigration, but almost 500,000 immigrants settled into Britain last year, most of them non-white. That is almost one percent of the total population, per year!  Actually the Brits have a sane party they could elect (the BNP), which stands up for their survival, but the mere fear of thinking that they might have done a thing considered racist stymies them into electing a seemingly better alternative that turns out to be even worse. Instead, whites in Britain prefer the path of the least resistance - emigrating into white countries that still have a lower share of non-whites, but without realizing that this process exacerbates the takeover of the United Kingdom by hostile non-whites.</p>

<p>Of course they do when compared to poor third-worlders who&rsquo;ll take ANY wage and not complain! The British expect to be treated better than that in their own country and by their own countrymen! Obviously their work ethic was good enough to make Great Britain a first-world country that attracted all these foreigners in the first place!</p>

		<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anywhere in the article pointing out the liberal give away programs in England for the muslims (which is mostly what the &#8216;immigrants&rsquo; are) They are NOT coming for jobs any more than the allies landed on the Normandy beaches looking for jobs or a &#8220;better life&#8221; They are coming for the freebies and to turn the Emerald Isles into the same sort of desert they left. Goats and sheep with their grazing manner will destroy the fertility of England as they have done anywhere there are muslims.</p>

		<p>The madness of the Labour Party&rsquo;s &#8216;open door&rsquo; immigration policy exposed.<br/>
 The fact is that Britain has only a sixth of the USA&rsquo;s population, and an even tinier proportion of the USA&rsquo;s land mass, so the real extent of Labour&rsquo;s lunacy is even more pronounced.</p>

		<p>Britain has been already sold out by Labour for future votes. The amazingly foolish country is such a sucker land for exploiting immigrants that one wonders how the native Brits could have been so stupidly suicidal out of fear of being called &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>
<p>I hope Americans aren&rsquo;t as similarly stupid but we have our share of sell-out politicians &amp; suicidal bleeding hearts.</p>

		<p>The financial rewards for politicians in Britain to promote the demographic and cultural destruction of their own country must be great. One could expect this of democratically elected politicians but it appears as if the Windsors are doing nothing to oppose it either.</p>

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The Windsors [Battenbergs] are sitting on a tottering throne. All European royalty got a great scare after WW One, witnessing the fate of their Russian relatives, the Romanov&rsquo;s, and being helpless to do anything about it, fearing the same thing might happen to them.  Since then, they have all been been totally preoccupied with looking out for themselves and their own necks, and have all been stripped of any power except as ceremonial figureheads. They have no power to do anything meaningful. They hardly dare open their mouths (except to recite speeches that are written for them). One wrong step or wrong word, and they would be replaced or dethroned tomorrow. They know this. Look at what happened to Elizabeth&rsquo;s uncle Edward when he shook hands with the wrong person.  Surely Elizabeth remembers, and she knows better than to get involved with controversial politics or politicians.  Now, royalty is strictly non-controversial and non-political. They are allowed to continue to exist so long as they behave.</p>
