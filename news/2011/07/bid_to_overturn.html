<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New requirements for immigrants to speak basic English before joining their spouse in the UK were deemed racist last night.</p>
<p>It is claimed the language test discriminates against British-Indian families and their traditions, and breaches their human rights.</p>
<p>The Home Office now requires such people to speak a minimum level of English.</p>
<p>But three couples are challenging the rule, introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May in November.</p>
<p>They claim it contravenes their rights to a family life, their right to marry and constitutes discrimination. One case is that of British citizen Rashida Chapti, 54, and husband Vali Chapti, 57, who wants to join her in the UK.</p>
<p>They have been married for 37 years and have six children together. Mr Chapti is an Indian national and does not speak, read or write English.</p>
<p>Mrs Chapti has reportedly been travelling between India and Leicester for around 15 years but has now applied for her husband to join her.</p>
<p>The immigration rules require Mr Chapti to show a basic knowledge of English before he can be given permission to stay. At the High Court in Birmingham yesterday, Manjit Gill QC, for the couple, said the requirement was a breach of their human rights.</p>
<p>It contravened several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The rule is particularly striking in that it prevents mere residence even though one of the parties is fully entitled to live in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Home Secretary Theresa May said last year: &#8220;It is a privilege to come to the UK and that is why I am committed to raising the bar for migrants.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Considering that English is one of India&rsquo;s national languages, and the only common langauage, this is pretty sad.</p>
<p>Britian gave India its independence.  India quit the Commonwaelth.  Then the UK turns around and lets them move to tiny Great Britain.  Send the whole lot home!</p>

It&rsquo;s sad, but what more can be said? This is the natural result of granting nonwhites from the Commonwealth the right to come the the UK. If you have a right to come, why should language be a barrier?</p>

<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no law which says they must immigrate.</p>
<p><i>Home Secretary Theresa May said last year: &ldquo;It is a privilege to come to the UK and that is why I am committed to raising the bar for migrants.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>There you go, baby! Did you ever think we&rsquo;d see the day when the politicians were going our way? I&rsquo;m telling you, those politicians know which way the wind is blowing. The momentum is on OUR side now.</p>
<p>I must admit, those who said nothing would change until the wheels came off the trolley were right. This wouldn&rsquo;t be happening if the economy was still hot. No one wants a bad economy but it&rsquo;s helping our cause at home and abroad.</p>

		<p>This strikes me as ironic considering that East Indians consistently win or place high in the National Spelling Bee every year.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapti sounds like he emphatically has no interest in learning English and is content using his wife as an interpreter when necessary.  How can a law discriminate against someone who simply doesn&rsquo;t want to follow the rules?</p>

<p>fred:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see that at all, given the latest ruling.  I see the forces against us as winning, not us; they are indeed more powerful than we are and are gaining strength against us.  Soon we will be numerically outnumbered in England and elsewhere (picture South Africa). </p>
<p>What will it take?  When government sanctioned killing of whites starts maybe then people will start to revolt against the upside down English police state in which they&rsquo;re forced to live.  But then, the government has disarmed the people so when the time for white ethnic cleansing begins (and it WILL happen), whites will be not only subjected to government pogroms but have not means to defend themselves.</p>
<p>I envision the scenario the Ukrainians faced against the Soviets in the &rsquo;30s:  mass starvation and killings.</p>

		<p>I agree with #5. Not only would the airfare between England and India be better spent on English lessons, but they could also buy a good number of English books and tapes for far less than what they must be spending on lawyers fighting this case.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree.  The last thing we need are more cheap labor Indians who know English so that more industries from the white world can be outsourced to Bangalore.  I rue the day the first English speaking white man set foot on the Indian subcontinent.  </p>

		<p>This is what Britain deserves for its unproved attack on Germany. </p>
<p>Remember that POLAND invaded GERMANY at the end of World War 1. </p>
<p>And it took Hitler to stop the invasion of Poland. Then Britain attack &#8220;Racist&#8221; Germany.</p>
<p>This is what you get, Britain for attacking &#8220;Racists&#8221; people.</p>

		<p>From their names I make out that they are muslims. That said a lot of the muslims in India refuse to speak the &#8220;national language&#8221; Hindi, among the urban Indians there may be more English speakers than Hindi! Rashida whatever she does must be quite educated and well placed to afford all the trips to and fro from India, I&rsquo;m sure she is not a char-woman. I see this more as stubborn arrogance Vali&rsquo;s part. The British should stick with their laws. FYI more Indian nationals than English were killed in WW II, Indians and so many others were citizens of the commonwealth and the British were expecting to get India and others back into their folds, thus the slack laws about immmigration, can&rsquo;t ignore ulterior motives and history?</p>

<p>Of course. Not too many people know history except for the PC brand.  That includes what they tell us about World War 11. As some have said, I believe Patton was one of them, we fought on the wrong side.</p>
