<h1>US Arrests 2,000 in Anti-Drug Sting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Google News, July 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>US authorities have arrested nearly 2,000 people on narcotics charges in a 20-month sting targeting Mexico&rsquo;s La Familia Michoacana drug cartel, the US Justice Department said Thursday.</p>
<p>The ongoing multi-agency takedown saw 1,985 people arrested, along with the seizure of about $62 million in US dollars, and more than 12 tons of drugs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Through their violent drug trafficking activities, including their hallmark of supplying most of the methamphetamine imported into the United States, La Familia is responsible for recklessly and violently destroying countless lives on both sides of the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the drugs which were rounded up were 2,773 pounds (1,258 kilograms) of methamphetamine, 6,000 pounds (2,722 kilograms) of cocaine, 1,005 pounds (456 kilograms) of heroin, 14,818 pounds (6,721 kilograms) of marijuana and $3.8 million in other assets.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 300 federal, state, local and foreign law enforcement agencies participated in the operation.</p>

		<p>End the bogus &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;. Stop making the cartels rich. And the DEA too. Its budget has increased 4000% since the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; began. Time to end the nonsense and let people decide for themselves what they are going to smoke, snort or ingest into their own bodies.</p>

		<p>We only ever hear about the marijuana coming into our nation from Mexico.</p>
<p>I get such heartbreaking pictures in my mind when I think of all of the White Americans who have succumbed to the enslavement of meth. However, I always thought that the stuff was cooked here in the states. This news is most disturbing. </p>
<p>Thanks, A.R., for the story about the the twenty-five mexican men rushing the lone deputy at a traffic stop. Many were illegal. Who knows how many? One can&rsquo;t get any info in our upside-down world. I saw a picture of the scoundrels on another sight: they were wearing bandanas on their faces and rushing the cop. It looked surreal and absolutely third-world. </p>
<p>What is the damned goal of keeping the border open? Very powerful people WANT our people hooked on poison? Very powerful people WANT our sheriff deptuies to be punked by illegal criminals?  </p>

		<p>Charles Murray once pointed out that there is a problem in legalizing drugs when you have a welfare system in place. You end up subsidizing drug users.</p>
<p>But then they already get free room and board in jail.</p>

		<p>La Familia used to be part of the Gulf Cartel, as did The Zetas, but they broke off and pursued their own ambitions.</p>
<p>The Zetas also broke off from the Gulf Cartel, and looks to me to be increasing in size and influence.  The group initially acted as the muscle for the Gulf Cartel.  The members allegedly came from the Mexican military and were trained by US Special forces.</p>
<p>The Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels are still the two biggest drug gangs, but there&rsquo;s been so much splintering off it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with unless a person follows the gangs closely.</p>
<p>It is the Tijuana and Juarez cartels that are mostly involved in the killings along the border now, though not exclusively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute mess.  There&rsquo;s so much money to be made in illegal drugs people and groups are popping up everywhere to get a piece of the pie, and the existing gangs earn so much money they keep moving into the US more and more every year, spreading their wealth around to buy influence and political cooperation.<br/>

		<p>Just legalize all drugs tax them and the problem is eliminated plus with all the revenue you can abolish the IRS and many other taxes. </p>

		<p>Remember how strongly the government opposed gambling until they decided they needed more revenue, then lotteries and casinos were o.k.?</p>
<p>Well, the economy across the nation is in worse shape now than when they legalized gambling, so I&rsquo;m wondering if legalizing drugs will be next.</p>
<p>They might as well.  The war on drugs is a complete and total failure, but, worse, it&rsquo;s causing the growth of a criminal element in Mexico which has reached the financial and military power of a nation state.</p>
<p>I saw where the Zetas are threatening to take over the Mexican government a couple of days ago.  I doubt they could do it by themselves, but if all the gangs called a truce and united, I&rsquo;m pretty sure their combined financial and military power would exceed that of the government.  In other words it&rsquo;s a very real possibility.</p>

		<p>Reply to Michael C. Scott:</p>
<p>They ARE working. They are working for the cartels, distributing drugs. And probably making an awful lot of tax-free money too.</p>

		<p>The War on Drugs is working about as well as prohibition did. All it has accomplished is wasting billions of dollars,putting millions in jail and financing an army of Mexican killers. </p>
<p>Legalize pot, let doctors write maintenance prescriptions for addicts and spend the billions doing something constructive.</p>
