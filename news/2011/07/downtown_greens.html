<h1>Downtown Greensboro &#8220;Flash Mob Beatings&#8221; Investigated by Police</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>DigTriad (Greensboro), July 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the term &#8220;flash mob.&#8221; It&rsquo;s when groups of people use social media to pick a place to meet up and often sing a song or do a dance. Usually, those gatherings are fun.</p>
<p>But, some are turning violent. It&rsquo;s happening all over the nation in places like Chicago, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Now, it&rsquo;s happening right here in the Triad.</p>
<p>Greensboro police say mobs of violent teens are meeting up on the weekends and wreaking havoc downtown. Police say it&rsquo;s getting worse each weekend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the teenagers came up from behind and just punched me in the back and kicked me and knocked me to the floor. Then, he just continued to kick me, punch me, step on me. People were screaming,&#8221; Mitchel Sommers, executive director of the Community Theatre of Greensboro said.</p>
<p>The swarm came from nowhere and the beating lasted seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within a minute, I&rsquo;d say, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds &hellip; I&rsquo;m not being dramatic &hellip; hundreds of young people &hellip; just came descending upon this area,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There were so many young people. I would say all the way from across Elm Street all the way to the park. You couldn&rsquo;t even get out of the swarm of young people.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Every weekend in July, Greensboro police have battled large, flash-mob beatings and vandalism</p>
<p><br/>
{snip}</p>
<p>Texts, Tweets and Facebook posts tell teens when to be at the park. Then, the violence begins.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greensboro Police will be out early Friday and Saturday evening with four to six extra officers, trying to stop these violent flash mobs before they get started.</p>

		<p>This is too good. We love it. We hope it never ends.</p>
<p>Greensboro is completely obsessed with becoming a Civil Rights pilgrimage site, with the Woolworth renovation where black children can go sit at the same lunch counter where black activists forced themselves upon the workers and patrons.</p>
<p>Let Greensboro suffer. Anybody who embraces Civil Rights and Diversity deserves nothing but contempt from us and a full frontal assault from the Diversity Curse.    Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a better place.   Whites in N.C. are all liberal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The swarm came from nowhere and the beating lasted seconds.&#8221;  Sounds like Margaret Mitchell in Gone With the Wind telling about &#8220;swarms of blacks&#8221; in Atlanta.    Highly prejudiced, highly accurate.  <br/>

		<p>Another &#8220;ageist&#8221; article that identifies &#8220;teens&#8221; and &#8220;young people&#8221;.  How dare they, since not all young people are violent?  How does it add any relevant information to the story?</p>
<p>As you all have figured out, the above paragraph is sarcasm, used to make the case that they should mention race as well.  When they don&rsquo;t, as they didn&rsquo;t here, we will assume it was a mob of blacks, because what else could it be?</p>

		<p>No effective solution can be found to solve any problem unless the problem is first clearly defined. Victims Euphemistically calling roving bands of usually taxpayer supported &#8220;Blacks&#8221;, &#8220;youth&#8221;, &#8220;teenagers&#8221; or &#8220;young people, only whets the appetites of those Thugs to do even more of, what to them, comes naturally.  As usual, when rumor and word of mouth causes the stories such as this to get out, the &#8220;news&#8221; sanctimoniously points the finger at the politicized cops. </p>
<p>The American people grant certain rights and privileges to a supposedly &#8220;free press&#8221; for the purpose of keeping the public informed. Because of this privileged status, it is not its place to spoon feed the public information the cops are willing to reveal. Rather, it is the duty of the press to DEMAND the cops provide that information, and then to transmit that information to the public. </p>

		<p>Two things that make me MAD.</p>
<p>1.  Almost always they make sure at least one black reporter is involved in the story to make it seem as if &#8216;not all blacks are bad.&rsquo;  I know that; I don&rsquo;t need such a blatant visual cue.</p>
<p>2.  They almost always show white kids when they throw kids in the stories of these flash mob and beat downs.  In this report here, notice it&rsquo;s a pair of white kid&rsquo;s hands typing on the computer when they mention that &#8216;teens&rsquo; are using the computer to organize these things.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these things make you mad too?</p>

<p>When you hear about a WHITE flash mob, it&rsquo;s likely to be singing, dancing, pillow fights, and fun. When you hear about a BLACK flash mob, it&rsquo;s likely to involve stealing and violence.</p>
<p>&#8216;All these young (BLACK) people have nothing better to do but to head downtown and beat up a 58 year old (WHITE) guy minding his own business&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s clearer.<br/>

		<p>The upper-ranking officers who withheld information regarding the race of the offenders should be fired.  </p>
<p>While most reasonably aware people would assume that the attackers were black, the public certainly has a right to as much information as possible regarding the attackers, including their racial composition.</p>
<p>Of course nowadays, failure to mention the race of felons is an omission code for black.  There perhaps are, however, still people out there who don&rsquo;t know this.</p>

		<p>How many people want to bet that we&rsquo;re going to see these &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; all around the country on Election Day 2012?  I wouldn&rsquo;t at all be surprised to find that these incidents, which seem to be growing exponentially both in frequency and geographically, are orchestrated ultimately to intimidate white people from voting - I think Obama and his &#8220;crew&#8221; are desperate to depress white turn-out next year &#8220;by any means necessary.&#8221;  Remember the Philadelphia voter intimidation case by the so-called &#8220;Black Panthers&#8221;? </p>

		<p> Arm certain selected police S.W.A.T. teams with Uzi submachine guns. Dispatch them pronto when reports are received of such shenanigans. Have them fire one burst over the heads of the crowd, and warn them to disperse. If they don&rsquo;t, fire a burst into the crowd. Once this happens a time or two, the &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; will be gone with a   &mdash;   well, a &#8220;flash.&#8221; Problem solved.</p>
<p> By the way, did I miss it, or was there no mention of race in this story? No doubt the &#8220;youffs&#8221; are all the colors of our glorious rainbow of diversity.</p>

		<p>After my orginal post I clicked on the orginal article and was disgusted by what I saw. They have a picture of two WHITE males riding bikes, beside a story about &#8220;youth&#8221; flash mob beatings. WHY is that do you think? We all KNOW here, and so does the majority of the white population, so these people ain&rsquo;t fooling nobody. Still, what a low down thing to do! </p>

		<p>&#8220;Young people, young people, young people, teenagers, violent teens&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, it sure is a good thing the warnings are finally coming out! <br/>
Now, fairly warned of the danger of flash mobs, which started as unannounced performances of song and dance and are now apparently &#8220;turning violent&#8221;, we can make a quick escape if a group of those terrifying &#8220;young people&#8221; show signs of danger, like suddenly beginning to sing the Hallelujah chorus. <br/>
Now you know: if you see or hear sudden song and dance, escape immediately, before the &#8220;mob&#8221; of &#8220;youths&#8221; turns violent. </p>
<p>I feel safer already, knowing that authorities are publicly committed to dealing seriously with these threatening teens. Almost makes me want to shout out and jump for joy -  What&rsquo;s that officer? No, wait! Don&rsquo;t taser me, bro! I was just -  Aaarrrghh!!</p>

Sharpton and I applaud the good citizens of Greensboro for their continuing search for equality and justice.  Let us continue to make those sacrifices necessary in this great and ongoing struggle against white privilege.&#8221; </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s called &#8220;Winning The Ghetto Lottery.&#8221; While most of these attackers know they won&rsquo;t be identified/caught, they also know that if they are shot by a cop, citizen, storeowner, etc., (anyone with deep pockets) they have a big lawsuit coming. The only real way for police to do it is like down in Brazil: start making people disappear. </p>

		<p>Who thought it would be otherwise? For 40 years every class, book, television program, and film indoctrinates that Whites have help black people down. No one bothers with statistics. No one cares about context. No one harbors any fears this all might end very badly. One day, and not too distant, these folks will find out what real racism is&hellip;and it will be sad for everyone involved.</p>

		<p>Can any American not conclude that the teens are blacks?  Who else hits white men in the back?  And unprovoked as well.  </p>
<p>The media continues to lose credibility.  It demeans the intelligence of its viewers in deference to being sensitive to blacks.  As a public safety issue, the details of the perpetrators must be known.  As a service in the fight against criminal behavior the nature of the perpetrators must be known.  Shameful shallow thinking on the part of the press.  Cowards at best, duplicitous at worst.</p>
<p>And that the police failed to report the preps details is perhaps criminal in itself.  Especially if they didn&rsquo;t put it in the police blotter.  If it were white-on-black unprovoked mass assault it would be international news.  But black-on-white mass assault is buried.  It doesn&rsquo;t fit the local political belief structure nor the main stream media&rsquo;s ideals of utopia.  Cognitive dissonance. PC solution   &mdash;   ignore, under-report and lie.</p>

		<p>I lost count of how many times the first victim interviewed used the phrase &#8220;young people&#8221; to describe the attackers. No racial component at all, of course. That&rsquo;s only when whites beat up a black.</p>
<p>The first victim is still absolutely clueless. He wants to figure out a way to keep this from happening again (without acknowledging the racial component, of course). </p>
<p>The news report mentioned the huge hordes of rioters converging on the park. Still no mention of race. I guess nobody noticed it. </p>
<p>Then the kicker: The police hushed the whole incident up. I guess the public should be kept in the dark that their parks are now unsafe. </p>
<p>What an insane country we live in! The whole country is &#8220;racist&#8221; and yet whites are falling all over themselves to avoid noticing the racial component of anti-white racial attacks.</p>

		<p>What is particularly frightening about these incidents, even despite the fact they were unreported, is the national character of these attacks.  If one was traveling with a family that included children, where is it safe to go?  I am particularly interested in historical places.  How long before it is entirely too dangerous to make a journey across America? Don&rsquo;t bring the family to Philly to see the Liberty Bell or the Old Meeting House, don&rsquo;t come to the nation&rsquo;s capital and all of it&rsquo;s special places and museums, don&rsquo;t go through any city of any size, day or night.  Where and when will this stop?  Of course I know that answer, we all do that come here to Amren, but still it never stops hurting me, in my own country, I must fear my countrymen.</p>

		<p>In reply to the post below.  Yes it makes me very mad.  That was really the last straw that made me seek out sites like this.  I knew I couldn&rsquo;t be alone.  The media is literally twisting facts.  </p>

Two things that make me MAD.</p>
<p>1. Almost always they make sure at least one black reporter is involved in the story to make it seem as if &lsquo;not all blacks are bad.&rsquo; I know that; I don&rsquo;t need such a blatant visual cue.</p>
<p>2. They almost always show white kids when they throw kids in the stories of these flash mob and beat downs. In this report here, notice it&rsquo;s a pair of white kid&rsquo;s hands typing on the computer when they mention that &lsquo;teens&rsquo; are using the computer to organize these things.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t these things make you mad too?<br/>

		<p>For those commenters who targeted highly placed police for not mentioning the race of the mobbers:  It&rsquo;s obviously true that some do not state that these criminals are black.  But it is the function of a free press to ferret out details and publish them!  Even if a police chief emphatically stated that a flash mob was all black, the print and TV media would censor the fact!  Worse, they dig up stock footage of white teens, white hands, white faces, or white whatever to accompany the stories!  Is there even a single recorded instance of a white or even white/other flash mob that invaded a store and committed mass shoplifting?  Moreover, the MSM always calls such assaults &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; when some are likely bunches of neighborhood criminals grabbing their girlfriends and taking public transport to malls to accost whitey and his enterprises.  </p>

&#8220;How many people want to bet that we&rsquo;re going to see these &ldquo;flash mobs&rdquo; all around the country on Election Day 2012? I wouldn&rsquo;t at all be surprised to find that these incidents, which seem to be growing exponentially both in frequency and geographically, are orchestrated ultimately to intimidate white people from voting - I think Obama and his &ldquo;crew&rdquo; are desperate to depress white turn-out next year &ldquo;by any means necessary.&rdquo; Remember the Philadelphia voter intimidation case by the so-called &ldquo;Black Panthers&rdquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right! Everyone seems to forget that one of those &#8220;Panthers&#8221; ( an insult to the noble felines) stood on a corner on Philly&rsquo;s South Street exhorting fellow Mau Mau to &#8220;kill the crackers and kill their little babies&#8221;.  <br/>

<p>Cops can be seen simply observing while this POS does his thing.  Can you imagine the unlikely scenario of a White guy calling in public for the killing of the dreaded &#8220;N words&#8221; and their children? How can White policemen sit there and listen to that monstrous rhetoric?   </p>
<p>What ever happened to the charges of &#8220;Inciting to Riot&#8221; &amp; &#8221; Making Terroristic threats&#8221;?<br/>
I suppose these laws apply only to Whites.<br/>
What a HELLISH. SURREAL, OBSCENE nightmare this society has become. <br/>

		<p>To me it seems as it (blacks) are actually at WAR with whites.</p>
<p>Not just a game but a real WAR that will continue to increase in brutality and numbers until (if ever) whites start defending themselves in ways that are legal. Every American has a right to use Extreme Force to defend themselves or their family.</p>

I wonder what the White liberals would say to all of this? I&rsquo;m guessing they would think to themselves &#8220;Poor kids&hellip;..we need to find them a positive outlet for their frustration over society&rsquo;s unjusts bestowed upon them&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>Black reporters are also used to intimidate White witnesses so that they don&rsquo;t say anything negative about blacks.</p>
<p>Check out this video and see how CBS blurs out the head of the black who has just stolen a &#8220;sail foam&#8221; from a White woman. Of course, race is never mentioned in the story either.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  When would be victims start carrying pepper spray, small clubs or other weapons these flash mobs will soon disappear.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t work for two reasons:  </p>
<p>There are too many of &#8220;them.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Within a minute, I&rsquo;d say, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds … I&rsquo;m not being dramatic … hundreds of young people … just came descending upon this area,&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t even get out of the swarm of young people.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Second reason:   blacks, in a state of &#8216;excited delirium&rsquo;, are impervious to pepper spray.</p>
<p>Race riots are spreading across the country, all the way to the West Coast.  This happened yesterday:</p>
<p><i>An overcrowded theater and an invitation to a block party ended with an out-of-control crowd swarming Hollywood Boulevard outside a film premiere, leading to a clash with police in riot gear and closure of the famous street.</i></p>
<p><i>Some people threw bottles, vandalized cars and several hundred refused orders to disperse after they were forced to leave Grauman&rsquo;s Chinese Theatre for a screening of a documentary about an electronic music festival Wednesday night, authorities said.</i></p>

		<p>And to help things along, the MSM just published a study that shows that blacks (and Hispanics) are far poorer than the average black.  The comment I heard made during the initial report Monday on CNN was to the effect that &#8220;some targeted adjustments might be needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>OF course it&rsquo;s a prelude to a new push for targeted taxing, but it&rsquo;s almost as if they are encouraging violence against whites.  Are liberal reporters so removed from these flash mob stories that they don&rsquo;t realize that they might be encouraging it?</p>

		<p>Speaking of media bias against Whites</p>
<p>That article about Maxine Waters and the NAACP comference came from the WAVEpapers.  The WAVE group covers black issues.  It has a lot of community papers in the black suburbs of Los Angeles such as Compton, Carson etc.</p>
<p>I started reading the WAVE papers during and after the Rodney King riots.  I found that the WAVE papers had much, much less biased against Whites coverage than the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times was totally on the side of the black rioters.  I read its articles.  What the Times did fits the legal definition of inciting to riot.</p>
<p>The black owned, black advocacy WAVE papers were far more balanced that the LA Times.</p>
<p>The WAVE reporters wrote that Stanley Sheinbaum, a communist married to one of Jack Warner&rsquo;s daughters, President of the Los Angeles commission at the time, stood behind the police officers guarding the entrance to police headquarters.</p>
<p>According to the WAVE article, Sheinbaum stood behind the out numbered officers repeating again and again, &#8221; I am watching and taking names. If you shoot or harm any demonstrators you will lose your job and pension and will be sued until you die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later Sheinbaum was driven in a police convoy to his palace in Brentwood.  His palace is located on a winding street in the hills.  Rioters would never bother to go up in those hills because there are so many stores and businesses in the Brentwood shopping district to loot.</p>
<p>Typical anti White liberal.  A professor of marxist economics manages to marry the Warner Bros movie fortune and uses that money to destroy Whites.  Between Sheinbaum on the police commission and the federal court consent decree, the LAPD has been destroyed.  </p>
<p><br/>
I love seeing the people of Los Angeles reading their Spanish, Russian, Farsi, Armenian language papers</p>
<p>I love seeing the Filipinos reading their English language Filipino community papers.  The LA Times hates White Americans and worships immigrants.  But the only people who read the Times are a few liberal White Americans who are all in the 60-90 age range.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see the Times fold.  They do own LA Opinion a Spanish language newspaper.  The Indian hispanic immigrants can&rsquo;t read Spanish.  Most of the hispanic immigrants are Indians who can&rsquo;t read Spanish.  Even LA Opinion is losing circulation.</p>

		<p>40 years ago a big San Francisco  Sears store closed down because mobs of hispanic kids invaded, stole and trashed the place.  They had to hire security guards to escort employees to their cars.  For those who didn&rsquo;t have cars there was a shuttle bus to a safer area to wait for the bus.</p>
<p>The Sears closed down because of loses and fear of lawsuits by employees who were assaulted in the mob attacks.</p>
<p>Then the local MALDEF ranted and raved and filed a lawsuit claiming that Sears closed because of racism and discrimination.</p>
<p>That huge store was vacant for several years because of course no business wanted to move to a location that had been closed down because of mob shoplifting.  Finally a state of California government agency took over the building.</p>
<p>As soon as MALDEF, MECHA and LARAZA were formed they adopted the very same tactics and strategy of the black organizations.  Why?</p>
<p>Because the hispanic organizations were created by the very same Ford Foundation funded and Saul Alinsky trained liberals that created the black organizations.  Whether black, hispanic, female, asian, environmentalists virtually all of these advocacy groups are created, funded and directed by wealthy American elites with the object of destroying White America.</p>
<p>Being a historian, I&rsquo;d say that their goal is about 60 percent achieved.</p>

When have Republicans ever done anything truly conservative?  Reagan didn&rsquo;t secure the border- he gave amnesty to 3 million Mexicans.  Bush was more damaging than Clinton.   </p>

		<p>oldwhitelady,</p>
<p>That transportation question is really a good one.  How are they gathering so quickly?  In order for it to be a &#8220;flash mob&#8221;, they must be able to gather together very quickly.  There probably is mass transportation available other wise they would be driving their cars around looking for parking spaces in crowded cities, or they would have walked for blocks or they would have rode their bikes for blocks.  It seems that there definitely has to be a mass transportation angle to this to make it work.  </p>
<p>Maybe the cities can look into this and stop any mass transit train that is suddenly full of &#8220;yoots&#8221;.  How are they getting back to wherever they came from?   Same way.  Maybe they can be rounded up as they exit at the train station.</p>

<p>Ok.  So I will ask you:  How would you classify the 50% of NCers that vote Republican?  Do you classify them as Liberals?  If not, then what are they?  I sure would like to know.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside&hellip;one of my best friends is a member of the Greensboro city police department.  I called him up after reading this article to get the downlow.  To my chagrin, he had not even heard that flash mobs have been going on in Greensboro at all!! I can draw my own conclusions as to how that might be possible.</p>
