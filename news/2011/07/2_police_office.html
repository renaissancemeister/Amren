<h1>2 Police Officers Injured in Melee Outside Sodo Nightclubs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Seattle Times, July 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Seattle police officers suffered minor injuries early Monday while trying to break up a melee outside two nightclubs in the city&rsquo;s Sodo District.</p>
<p>Dozens of fights broke out among a crowd of about 1,500 people, and some in the crowd were armed with guns, Seattle police said.</p>
<p>As closing time neared, around 2 a.m., patrons headed out of the two clubs in the 2900 block of First Avenue South into the street.</p>
<p>Police reported that &#8220;dozens of large-scale fights&#8221; had broken out on First Avenue South and Occidental Avenue with other people flooding to the scene of the fights, according to police spokeswoman Renee Witt.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An event posting on Facebook indicates the event at Republiq late Sunday night was called &#8220;Jamal Crawford&rsquo;s All Black Party w/Special Guests,&#8221; and that it was the NBA draft party for Isaiah Thomas, former University of Washington point guard recently drafted by the Sacramento Kings. {snip}</p>
<p>A status update from Sunday night on what appeared to be the club&rsquo;s Facebook page said: &#8220;The amount of people at Republiq tonight is incomprehensible. We promise you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Witt, the Seattle police spokeswoman, said it wasn&rsquo;t clear whether the incident signals that Sodo is becoming more like Belltown and Pioneer Square in terms of trouble when nightclubs close at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere you get a large number of people and you mix in alcohol and music and that kind of thing, you&rsquo;re bound to have some problems,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I went to Shamrock Fest in the DC area for 5 years in a row. It is a St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day party that is about 90% white with a few Asians and Hispanics thrown in. Remarkably enough, there is lots of drinking and music and yet no rapes, robberies and murders. </p>

		<p>Does anyone know what&rsquo;s going on with all this violence?  Is it on the rise or are is it just being reported more frequently do to the internet.  I&rsquo;m not sure if we are seeing in uptick in these incidents or just all the blogs, tweets and facebook content is making us aware of what is going on.</p>

		<p>True, I left Seattle in 2006, but while living in Belltown and partying in Pioneer Square, I never saw a mob of 1500 creaing havoc! The famed Crocodile Cafe, of Grunge and Indie fame is there, along with various other clubs and Sub Pop records, but it must have changed tremendously if they have mobs there now like the one described in this article about South Seattle. Course those two areas are mostly white and hipster.</p>

<p>I can think of many examples to the contrary.</p>
<p><i>An event posting on Facebook indicates the event at Republiq late Sunday night was called &ldquo;Jamal Crawford&rsquo;s All Black Party w/Special Guests,&rdquo; and that it was the NBA draft party for Isaiah Thomas, former University of Washington point guard recently drafted by the Sacramento Kings.</i></p>
<p>NBA players are locked out thanks to collective bargaining negotiations.  They ought not be celebrating anything.  Besides, I thought we weren&rsquo;t supposed to mention race, because it was irrelevant   &mdash;   Messrs. Crawford and Thomas could have just as well been Seventh Day Adventists waiting on a cold front.</p>

<p>I worked at rock concerts for 14 years.  There was not even one fight in all that time.  When rap came to the fore, the fighting started.  Need I mention the color of those &#8220;people.&#8221;</p>

		<p>No Sir.  Any time you get the RIGHT sort of people together and mix in alcohol and rap music and that sort of thing, you get these breakdowns in law and order.  BLACK PEOPLE.  That&rsquo;s the key ingredient.  And we, the rest of America, are getting damn sick and tired of it.</p>

		<p> At least the Seattle Times couldn&rsquo;t avoid letting the cat out of the bag this time, as the melee erupted after an officially &#8220;All-Black Party.&#8221; Bet the editor was sorely tempted to delete that fact from the story, so everyone would imagine all those violent people were blond, blue-eyed Swedes   &mdash;   or maybe some of those wild, crazy Amish.</p>
<p> But I notice the names of the two perps arrested for beating up the hot dog vendor and smashing his wagon were not revealed. Can you say &#8220;Antwan,&#8221; or maybe &#8220;D&rsquo;Quanto&#8221; or something along those lines?</p>

		<p>Anywhere you get a large number of people and mix in alcohol and music - AND THE PEOPLE ARE ALL BLACK OR HISPANIC - there is going to be serious trouble, guaranteed.  If it&rsquo;s black, somebody gets shot.  If it&rsquo;s Hispanic, somebody gets stabbed.  I&rsquo;ve been around long enough to know.</p>

There was in &#8216;incident&rsquo; involving urban males at a rap concert early Sunday morning in Niagara Falls, New York (AKA: urban nightmare). It wasn&rsquo;t reported by the Buffalo News until Thursday. </p>
<p>Even with extra precautions, it was all inevitable:</p>

		<p>This is a bit off topic but I wanted you all to see this and hopefully react to it with an email to Direct TV. The link is below. I don&rsquo;t know if any of you have seen the latest commercial with the thuggish Black boxer and his equally thuggish little bastard of a kid who at the end of the commercial punches and elderly White butler in the stomach; knocking him to the floor. The gentleman must be desperate for any work to subject himself to such degradation.<br>
I decided that it&rsquo;s time for White people to take some action. This is the customer service part of the website which permits you to send an email. <br>
Please all of you deluge them with negative responses. We can no longer just watch our own elimination.</p>

<p>In Seattle, SoDo (So[uth]Do[wntown]) and Pioneer Square was where grunge broke out back in the &rsquo;90s. It attracted a lot of young whites to the area. That scene faded and now Pioneer Square is contested ground between whites (mostly tourists) and blacks coming into downtown from the black neighborhoods to the south. </p>
<p>The first wake up call was when a young white man was beaten to death by a black mob on Mardi Gras in 1991, see <a href="http://goo.gl/XLH02" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/XLH02</a></p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t be alarmed by all the melee. It&rsquo;s simply Blacks responding to the warm weather. When you&rsquo;re forced to keep the jungle instinct suppressed for 6 or 7 months, and it suddenly finds an outlet, this is the end result. Now you know why Africa is such a backwards dump. </p>

Well I have attended countless Quartet, Symphonic and operatic events, where folks get really stewed at the bar . And not once in almost 45 years have I witnessed a fight or altercation of any sort. The worst words ever thrown being, &#8220;I wanted that parking spot you devil you !&#8221;<br>

		<p>Where I live, a city of 250,000 on the South coast of England, we get millions of visitors every year coming to &#8220;party&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s a student and &#8220;party&#8221; town.  Sure, theres the usual late night drunken brawling, which is bad enough, but to be expected when you get thousands of young people out in a small area, drinking until the early hours.  One thing that is VERY rare is gun crime though.  Until&hellip;a bar started an &#8220;R &#8216;n&rsquo; B&#8221; night.  Within two weeks,it was closed down, having been the site of at least two gun incidents and several stabbings. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you the ethnic breakdown of the clientele. Something else I saw the other day made my heart sink.  A Caribbean Takeaway has opened.  I&rsquo;m wondering how long it will be before that&rsquo;s closed down, due to shooting and stabbing incidents. All it will take will be someone to &#8220;diss&#8221; someone&rsquo;s Jerk Chicken, and out come the guns and knifes. It&rsquo;s opposite the fire station, maybe the firemen can come out and turn the hoses on them.  </p>

		<p>Having a mere handful of blacks present can be like a tiger in a sheep herd.  I live near a small WV city with a population of about 40,000 with 3-4% black.  Whenever nightclub violence occurs there, it&rsquo;s nearly always blacks  &mdash;  from the local university or from out-of-town.  About the only bars that can stay open are those playing country music or catering to redneck biker types.  </p>

		<p>NASCAR, which blacks love to hate and make fun of (listen to idiot african commedians/hate all whitey antics), collects approximately 100 to 150,000 thousand per weekend.  Yes, their is drinking and fever pitched fan cheering, but wait, why don&rsquo;t people die from stabbing and shootings, howcome cops aren&rsquo;t injured every weekend? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s white people, a different standard from the crux. Based on african statistics every weekend would be a new bloodletting.  Could it be the water, or the soul?</p>

<p><br>
 Because of a distant family connection, I had an occasion to attend a &#8220;Mob&#8221; wedding in South Philadelphia several years ago where there was lots of booze and music. There wasn&rsquo;t one incident of violence. There was an unspoken code of honor and decorum that was observed even by these people whom the DOJ has spent so many years trying to eradicate but has done little or nothing to eradicate the Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Mara Salvatrucha 13 and the many other Black and Hispanic gangs.<br>
Street thugs have taken control of a large part of our country and I find it hard to believe that there is nothing they can do to put and end to it. I only pray that our politicians get a good taste of the evil that they&rsquo;ve wrought on us. </p>
<p>Imagine our POTUS requesting a reprieve for a raping, murdering Mexican who yelled VIVA MEXICO before dying.<br>
If this guy is reelected in 2012 it will just embolden the Mau Mau even more and if he loses, that&rsquo;ll be another reason for them to increase the violence. It&rsquo;s coming either way and we&rsquo;d better be prepared to strike back but we need to send BHO back to his million dollar mansion in Chicago.</p>
<p>Did ANYONE EVER imagine that we would find ourselves in this situation and all because we didn&rsquo;t care enough?<br>
Just as an aside, I wonder when Glenn Beck is going to curtail his constant posthumous butt kissing of MLK, one of the biggest enemies the US ever had.<br>

<p>A small number of blacks can effectively ethnically cleanse a much larger number of whites because whites know that the govt considers blacks to be objects of worship.If they (whites) react in an appropriate manner to black misbehavior they will be subject to all sorts of legal sanctions and media demonization. </p>
<p>Under the current regime, the only way to bring black crime and incivility under control is to import Hispanic gangbangers. That&rsquo;s how the crime rate was brought down in  LA. Not endorsing it, just stating the facts in the contemporary USSA. </p>

		<p>@2 Mr. Freeman,</p>
<p>I have also noticed a bit of an upswing in honest reporting.  I honestly think that blacks are about to be scapegoated as a &#8216;catalyst for change&rsquo; that went fizzle-pop.  And that when the moment comes, it will be as an excuse for repression against all the rest of us as well.  Starting with the enmasse shut down of &#8216;provocative websites&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I also have to wonder at the kind of mentality that would seek out pre-mob psychologies as &#8216;the energy of the crowd&rsquo; among some 1,500 people.</p>
<p>You show up at a riot and nobody gives you much sympathy for the black eye and tear gas hack in the back of the paddy wagon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think blacks have been rejected for so long that they now seek to mimic us in their own cloistering of rebellion; seeking a &#8216;blacks only&rsquo; environment which devolves to trouble because (as Chris Rock says) &#8220;There be blacks and there be bleeeeeps and the ones always got to be ruinin&rsquo; the other&rsquo;s good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are their own worst enemy and it comes out the most in large gatherings where &#8216;keepin&rsquo; it real&rsquo; leads to a rapid loss of civility.</p>

		<p>You have that right &#8220;oldwhitelady.&#8221; </p>
<p>The latest mob attack has taken place in Dublin, Ireland. </p>
<p>http://goo.gl/W4ClV</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A MOB went on a wave of random race violence on Temple Bar, which left five Dubliners with horrific injuries.</p>
<p>One man   &mdash;   a Dublin DJ   &mdash;   was almost killed in the attack as he suffered serious head injuries when he was set upon by the gang.</p>
<p>The level of violence has shocked gardai and the many witnesses to the race hate orgy   &mdash;   believed to be the first of its kind in the city.</p>
<p>One member of the African gang was arrested today in pre-dawn raids by detectives across the capital.</p>
<p>Five Dubliners, all aged in their 20s, were left with horrific injuries in the October 2010 attacks, which have only come to light now.</p>
<p>Shocked</p>
<p>The gang   &mdash;   all aged in their late teens   &mdash;   savagely attacked six Irish people in the Temple Bar area of the capital in the early hours of October 10 last.</p>
<p>The gang, who are heavily involved in other street robberies and beatings, are all expected to appear in court.</p>
<p>Sources say that even seasoned detectives were left &#8220;horrified and shocked&#8221; by the extreme level of violence used in the attacks which occurred in the Eustace Street and Curved Street areas of Temple Bar at around 3.30am on the date in question.</p>
<p>A senior source explained: &#8220;We believe that what happened on the night was motivated by racism   &mdash;   that is racism against white people.</p></blockquote><br>

Absolutely right. The Metropolitan Opera is fine until the audience has a flute of champagne at the first intermission. After that, it all goes to hell in a handbasket. </p>

		<p>@Mister Freeman: &#8220;Does anyone know what&rsquo;s going on with all this violence?&#8221;</p>
<p>New &#8220;non-mentality&#8221; of black power brought on by Obama&rsquo;s presidency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to get worse and all this is aimed at the White establishment.</p>
<p>I witnessed this in Oakland, Ca. when the blacks where caught up in the Black Panther Party. Got really ugly for many years. </p>
<p>Now, with Obama encouraging all non-whites this era will not end.</p>
<p>Young Whites in the future will not stand a chance in this country.</p>

<p>As a European-American I find your latest commercial extremely offensive.  Considering all the attacks on innocent White Americans being perpetrated by gangs (flash mobs) of thuggish Black teenagers, to portray a thuggish Black boxer surrounded by his peeps and an obsequious elderly White butler being punched in the stomach by an equally thuggish and obnoxious kid is outrageous . I personally will never consider doing business with a company that preaches racial hate. If the races in the commercial were reversed your Ad would never have hit the screen.  I and all whom I can influence will never abide this double standard which unfortunately for the future of this country has become &#8220;THE STANDARD&#8221;. I will never do business with your racist enterprise.</p>

		<p>Even Chris Rock admits that this happens where ever blacks congregate at an entertainment venue. He was very realistic and used words that we are not allowed to post.  You can see the monologue on youtube. It&rsquo;s kind of humorous, but also horrifying. </p>

		<p>I recently attended a nightclass at a university in Los Angeles. I am in my 30&rsquo;s and the other students were of varied ages. The person sitting next to me was a teenager from Germany. He was a soft-spoken, bookish type. Some would say he was a &#8220;nerd&#8221;. He was a also a hard-working, nice person with impeccable English. He approached me one night and asked me for a ride to downtown. I warned him that this is dangerous at night, especially for a white person. He told me that he wanted to attend a gangsta-rap concert. I was mortified. I tried to explain to him how dangerous that was, but he could not conceptualize what I was trying to explain. Needless to say, I politely refused to drive him to that concert. Enough weak, naive German tourists are murdered by blacks. I can&rsquo;t understand why they refuse to see reality, and why gangsta rap is so popular in that country.</p>

<p>Because they have NOT seen it yet (as we have had to do the hard way).  And you PREVENTED  him from seeing it!  He probably  considers you a typical American racist.</p>
<p>You should have given him the ride.</p>

		<p>@ 41 I agree! </p>
<p>giving the kid a ride would have been a wonderful life lesson! assuming, that is, he made it out of the jungle alive. it makes me think of when i was a kid &amp; my mother told me that if she ever caught me smoking she&rsquo;d sit me down &amp; make me smoke the entire pack. sure that concert seemed great in theory, but once mein herr got to see  dangerous, disgusting reality live, armed &amp; in living color he&rsquo;d learn to like metal or really crappy techno like a smart german.</p>
