<h1>Ice Cream Truck Driver Shot and Killed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Bennish, Dayton Daily News, July 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police are looking for a young black man in Tuesday evening&rsquo;s fatal shooting of a well-known ice cream truck driver on Midway Avenue.</p>
<p>Carl Banks, 60, was shot moments after he sold ice cream to kids outside the Whitmore Arms Apartments in the 4600 block of Midway around 6:15 p.m., according to police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sgt. Dan Mauch, head of the homicide unit, said detectives theorize that Banks  &mdash;  with his truck, something of a fixture on west Dayton streets  &mdash;  was the target of a robbery attempt gone bad.</p>
<p>Witnesses told police they heard two or three shots and saw slightly built young man, possibly as young as 15, wearing red pants with a sweater pulled over his face, fleeing the scene.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes through the neighborhood every day,&#8221; said Pattrice Ingram, who lives in the Residence Park neighborhood. &#8220;He was a nice guy, pretty much a fixture around here.&#8221;</p>

Reading this jolted long buried memories of my mother, sister and I running to meet &#8220;the ice cream man&#8221; on those long, hot southern Louisiana summer days back in the 60&rsquo;s. Our ice cream man was also an elderly, kindly White man but he had a large truck that also made milk shakes, sundaes, banana splits etc. - a Dairy Queen on wheels. He knew everybody by name and knew what they liked and would usually have my favorite double chocolate milk shake going before I ever reached the truck. Nobody would&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of robbing/killing him.<br/>
Sadly, that kindly old man and that America are gone and I don&rsquo;t see how we can ever get it back. The kids of today don&rsquo;t know what they missed do they.</p>

		<p>Several years ago in Philadelphia  a young father of two who was an Iranian immigrant to the US was shot to death in N. Phila. by a band of Black &#8216;Youfs&#8221;. This man was a commissioned officer Major or Colonel) in the Iranian army during the war with Iraq. He wanted to escape the rule of the Ayatollahs so he came to America. He took a job as an ice cream truck driver ( Mr. Softee/ Good Humor) and was approached by the &#8220;youfs&#8221;. The final scene of this incident was the man lying in the street with fatal bullet wounds. A crowd of Mau Mau had gathered around him.</p>
<p>In a jocular manner they began opining as to the reason for the attack. One of the onlookers suggested that &#8221; Maybe he dint put enough sprinkles on da cone&#8221;. This suggestion resulted in an outburst of mirth on the part of the crowd.</p>

		<p>I still hear the ice cream man go by with his truck jingling out the repetitious tune.  Today the truck drives faster than it used to, probably because of stories like the above, and the drivers are primarily Mexican.  But, they are trying to make a living by doing honest work.  That&rsquo;s a lot more than I can say for those ghetto blacks who just shoot innocent people and steal what they want.  After reading that black men die younger on the streets, though, I wonder if we shouldn&rsquo;t just leave &#8216;em out there and hope for addiction to do its work quickly - but allow the rest of us to carry a concealed weapon&hellip;.</p>

I don&rsquo;t get it, we killed maybe a million Vietnamese in their own country, and regarding their private affairs&hellip;.for what?<br/>
But, the scene you described seems perfectly fit to include an AF-15 swooping down on the murderers laughing over the innocent dead man, and unleashing 10,000 pounds of napalm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whitmore Arms&#8221; Apartments? In my experience, anything with the word &#8220;arms&#8221; used in the name of an apartment complex is generally a section 8 housing project, for blacks and hispanics. Nothing good ever happens in such places. My fellow whites should stay away from such places as if your life depends on it, because it most likely does&hellip;. </p>

I can still hear in my head &#8216;Greensleeves&rsquo; and/or &#8216;Home On The Range&rsquo; blaring out of the loudspeaker on top of the van like it was yesterday. The thought of a young thug killing the Mr Whippie man for the probably pretty-average amount of cash in his till is completely incomprehensible to me, even now.<br/>

<p>Well&hellip;. maybe we didn&rsquo;t.  Where do you get the estimate? </p>
<p>Maybe we (Americans and British) also killed a million German civilians at Dresden in FDR&rsquo;s and Churchill&rsquo;s unnecessary war.  Or does your compassion only extend to third world types?<br/>
 <br/>
It&rsquo;s not clear from your comment, but it seems you are linking the F-15 to the Vietnam war.  The first fighter squadron of f-15s entered active service around 1976. This was after the Democrats had already stabbed our South Vietnamese allies in the back by pulling their aid and support and forcing them to battle the vicious North Vietnamese with no resources.         </p>

		<p>Ah, another neo-Nazi idiot invading Amren territory. Reminds me of the blacks who invade good White neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Those poor woe-is-me people at Dresden (BTW, far less than &#8220;a million&#8221; were killed there) were cheering when it was London that the bombs were falling upon. They danced in the streets when Warsaw and Paris and Rotterdam and Oslo were ravaged by an army of race traitors, white men killing white men, women, and children. And THEY started the war when they attacked Poland, a nation of fellow Whites. The Allies simply ended the war. The blood of millions of Whites is on the Nazis&rsquo; hands.</p>
<p>Between a black who wants to kill me for being White and a neo-Nazi who wants to kill me for being a non-&#8220;Aryan&#8221; White, I think the black is the lesser of the two threats. He at least can be calmed with BET, and his lower IQ makes him less dangerous.</p>
<p>God bless Winston Churchill, a great White patriot. As for FDR, he was a socialist, so no words of praise for him. (Although you neo-Nazi liars will try to pretend that I like him. You people always try that stuff, I&rsquo;ve argued with your type before).</p>

<p>The bombing at Dresden was wholly unjustified. The war was almost over and Churchill himself knew it was needless. He was afraid he would be considered a war criminal for it and tried to distance himself from it. </p>

		<p>To call someone a Neo-Nazi simply because he disagrees with fighting traditional European wars of empire and dominance is idiotic. Europeans made Hitler, he was their problem.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that today in light so much &#8220;counter-history&#8221; about the great white civil war, people still defend the two rouges, FDR and Winston Churchill.  </p>
<p>Of course FDR was enabled by the <i>&#8220;Greatest Naive Generation&#8221;</i> who elected him four times and who made him an undeserving legend in the US. At least the Brits kicked Churchill out of office.   </p>
<p>When Hitler came to power he aimed to restore the original German borders and neutralize the punishment of Versailles, and to bring his country out of the great depression.  He was on the way to succeed at both.  </p>
<p>Britain, France and Germany had always vied for dominance of Europe. This was the essential element of WWII; Britain and France feared and wanted to eliminate a revitalized and threatening competitor, Germany. </p>
<p>Churchill was always out for blood. Not his of course but that of somebody else. Yeah, yeah&hellip;he was in the Boer war but nobody really knows what he did due to his lies and exaggerations.    As <i>First Lord of the Admiralty</i>, he played a role in dragging a reluctant US into the first world war through various schemes and skullduggery. </p>
<p>Contrary to all rules of war, the allies in WWI blockaded Germany of food and non war material. Although the German army wasn&rsquo;t defeated, the civilian population was starving thus Versailles became necessary.  This is a primary reason Hitler struck east, to secure farmland, vowing never to be starved out again.  Another reason too was to knock the Russians out of the war before they could be aided by Britain. <br/>
 <br/>
Dresden was off limits to allied air much of the war due to the city&rsquo;s historical nature and lack of military significance.  At the time of the firebombing the war was practically over and the city was filled with thousands of people fleeing the advancing Red army.  </p>
<p>There is no accurate count of civilians killed because of the transient nature of the city&rsquo;s population at the time. To flippantly say a million Vietnamese were killed by the US has far less a basis than that number applied to Dresden. Hitler estimated 200,000. Other credible sources place it at 500,000 plus.    </p>
<p>By this juncture of the war, the Germans had moved much of their production to the countryside and into caves. Dresden was pure vengeance by the RAF with the USAF in tow. For this Churchill should have been charged as a war criminal. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m amazed at white people who shed rivers of tears for third worlders but scoff at any mention of white people murder by the RAF. </p>
<p>Vietnam war made necessary because of the mess the world was left in by Churchill, FDR and Truman.  Stalin emerged from WWII as a serious threat to Europe and other parts of the world; Cuba, Latin America, and Asia.  The US could not afford to get surrounded or allow the Soviets to gain warm water ports in the Pacific anywhere,(Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam?). </p>
<p>Had the US stayed out of WWII, Hitler and Stalin would have likely bashed themselves to death with their powerful armies, in pure European tradition. Korea and Vietnam would be just unknown places on the world map. </p>

<p>Had the US stayed about of WW2, we would be speaking German, you and most of us would never have been born, and those who did live here would be subject to regular purges by leaders like Hitler, undergoing dementia attacks due to being hooked on speed, like Hitler was.  The West would have enjoyed a Pax Germania that would look like Caligula&rsquo;s and Nero&rsquo;s reign combined.  Of course, they would have had to reckon with their allies, the Japanese.</p>
<p>I think all this historical supposition is ridiculous.  All these fascist pet theories of politics and history.  The main lesson is that whites waging civil wars is an idea that is NEW.  That people war, regardless of race is a fact of history.  Only a better and more thorough sense of white realism in the here and now will prevent more in the future.  But this will fail as long as historical revisions are the trade of white activists who spend more time vilifying whites (and Joos, the case being that scapegoating is unproductive) than attending to the present, unique situation.</p>
<p>Reading junk like some of these posts here fill me with hopelessness where the white race is concerned.</p>

		<p>Thank you Contrarian for writing one of THE most sane, informative posts I have ever read on this site.</p>
<p><i>Had the US stayed about of WW2, we would be speaking German, you and most of us would never have been born, and those who did live here would be subject to regular purges by leaders like Hitler</i></p>
<p>This is simply not true.</p>
<p>How was Germany possibly going to INVADE, SUBJUGATE and OCCUPY the population of the industrial US, approximately 130 million people?  How, pray tell were they going to do that, especially pull off an OCCUPATION??  They had neither the resources nor manpower for such an operation, considering that they were battling the Soviets on one side, the Eastern Front, and Britain on the other.  Germany was a pipsqueak, doomed from the very beginning (and the German generals knew it).</p>
<p>Germany with 66 million was outnumbered three to one by a British population of 46 million and the Soviet Union&rsquo;s 166 million.  Plus, Russia had the most powerful weapon of all:  The Russian winter. Germany could not match the weapon production of the Russians (who moved their factories out of German bombing range) while German industrial cities were being bombed  continually by huge four-engine British Lancasters.</p>
<p>As for Dresden: British Historian H.H. Liddell Hart writes in <i>History of the Second World War:</i></p>
<p><i>By February 1945, Germany was only a few weeks away from total defeat. Dresden produced mainly soap, china and cameras. Its value as a military target was dismissed by Allied strategists&hellip; the capital of Saxony (Dresden) had been considered so famous a cultural monument and so futile a military target that even the Commander in Chief of Bombing Command, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, had given it hardly a thought…</i></p>
<p><i>What Dresden did have was people. Hundreds of thousands of German refugees fleeing the Red Army had stopped in Dresden. Soviet soldiers were raping virtually all German women over the age of 10 (in another Allied atrocity). Winston Churchill wanted to strike at the German people one last time, mass murdering as many civilians as possible before the war ended.</i></p>
<p><i>Bomber Harris (Air Marshall A.T. Arthur Harris) ordered British air crews to hit the German city of Dresden.  Harris told the crews to ignore the factories and rail center and bomb residential areas.</i></p>
<p>One British pilot reported: <i>On 13th February 1945, I was a navigator on one of the Lancaster bombers which devastated Dresden. I well remember the briefing by our Group Captain. We were told that the Red Army was thrusting towards Dresden and that the town would be crowded with refugees and that the center of the town would be full of women and children. Our aiming point would be the market place.</i> </p>
<p><i>The British planes burned the entire city and its people. The body count put Dresden in the same league as Hiroshima and Nagasaki which the US hit with atomic bombs.  The fires could be seen for 120 miles.</i></p>
<p>After the war, H. H. Liddell Hart wrote:  <i>The British objective was not only to win but to exterminate, to kill Germans; London could have ended the was months early by bombing military targets, but British officials traded this opportunity away to continue bombing German families.</i></p>
<p>Superb Essay:  <i>I Cried Tears for Dresden<i>  http://www.christusrex.org/www1/war/dresden3.html</i></i></p>
<p>And here:  <i>The Allied Atrocity of Dresden</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started on the socialist and war monger FDR who promised the American people that he would &#8220;never send our boys to fight on foreign soil&#8221;  while prodding the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor so he could get into the European War!  He then framed, scapegoated and blamed the attack, which he engineered,  on Admirals Kimmel and Short!!  </p>
<p>Congress in 1999, declared Kimmel was not responsible for what had happened at Pearl Harbor  admiral.  Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), one of the sponsors of the resolution, called Kimmel and Short &#8220;the two final victims of Pearl Harbor.&#8221; </p>

		<p>There used to be a sign hanging in the airport at Savannah Georgia advertising the 8th Air Force Museum, It read, for the most part, &#8220;Had the mighty 8th not done its job, you would be speaking German.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somebody pointed out how ridiculous that was and the sign disappeared. It&rsquo;s like saying had Napoleon conquered all of Europe we would be speaking French.  </p>
<p>Germany, at its peak couldn&rsquo;t even invade old England across the channel.  Hitler had no navy except submarines. Yeah sure, I can see now the Africa Corps rolling through Kansas.  </p>
<p>Get real folks. </p>
