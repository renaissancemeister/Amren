			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sam Roberts, New York Times, July 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New York City edged a baby step closer to racial equilibrium in the last decade, according to census results released this month. Compared with the 1990s, the numbers of Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers grew more slowly; blacks recorded their first population loss since the Civil War; and non-Hispanic whites, who registered their smallest population loss in decades, also logged the biggest gains of any group among young children.</p>
<p>As a result, according to the 2010 census, the city was 33 percent non-Hispanic white, 29 percent Hispanic, 23 percent black and 13 percent Asian. In 2000, the city&rsquo;s makeup was 35 percent non-Hispanic white, 27 percent Hispanic, 25 percent black and 10 percent Asian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s clear that New York continues to draw white young adults and increasingly those with children to its gentrifying neighborhoods,&#8221; said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. &#8220;These white gains among the city&rsquo;s younger ranks along with its continued draw of immigrant minorities suggests that New York&rsquo;s long-term race-ethnic balance will not change appreciably.</p>

<p>With a bump in the Asian population NYC would be almost perfect, and the dream will have been fulfilled. Wonder what percentage of the white population finds safety attending NY public schools? Since the Utopia has been achieved, surely the public schools must have 30% of their desks filled up with white children? If not, is this proof the evil racism still exists in NYC and hasn&rsquo;t quite been confronted everywhere? If so, surely this is an opportunity for more good work fighting racism to be done&hellip; will this good work continue, or is a never ending process?</p>

<p>Thanks for the awesome link, but it&rsquo;s impossible to describe just how outdated it is for Colorado Springs now, a few short years later. In fact, regarding the &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; population (Mestizo), it was desperately wrong THEN. Way off.</p>
<p>It listed white 83%, Black 4%, Hispanic 9%</p>
<p>Today, if you use your eyes, and ignore official stats, you see it&rsquo;s Mestizo at about 20%, and if that wasn&rsquo;t heartbreaking and alarming enough, just this very summer, the blacks are FLOODING in. It started like a rivulet a few years ago, and now the worst offender-type of blacks are slunking about in virtually every part of the city, even places where they could not possibly live. </p>
<p>Official stats are just way off, and it&rsquo;s in the direction of painting a rosier picture.</p>
<p>Soon I shall leave this place; the Mestizos were more than enough, but the blacks make it&hellip;.a burgeoning hell on earth, ugly and dangerous at every turn.</p>

		<p>ATBOTL is correct. I spend enough time in NYC and can assure everyone that who and what these figures are considering &#8220;White&#8221; is, for the most part, a long way from what most race-realists would consider white by any stretch of the genetic immagination. While one may see a surprising number of Whites in(certain areas of)the city, the majority are tourists and commuters.  </p>

_______________________</p>
<p>Yes, in NYC  (unlike much of the West &amp; Midwest)&#8221;Hispanic&#8221; does not mean mestizo. It means mulatto.</p>
<p>First they were Puerto Ricans. Later, after about 1980, they were Dominicans. Since then, Dominicans have poured in and have overrun vast swaths of the city. They are darker than Puerto Ricans, but lighter than Haitians. Very few could pass as &#8220;white&#8221;.  They are very aggressive.  Call them Hispanic or whatever you want, but they are mulattoes,  just a variety of brown or black.</p>

<p>Except that there are exclusive neighborhoods for Koreans, Nigerians, Dominicans, Brazilians. Exclusively black neighborhoods, exclusively Asian Neighborhoods, all Hispanic areas. That&rsquo;s not &#8216;segregation&rsquo; but something to be proud of and celebrate and something to expand. It&rsquo;s just a coincidence they all immigrate or later move to the same place. No whites employed there? Diversity has come at last and certainly not something to &#8216;investigate&rsquo;. </p>
<p>There are no &#8216;white neighborhoods&rsquo;, certainly none for the middle or lower class. That&rsquo;s a preferred area to &#8216;integrate&rsquo;. Much preferred. There are no white neighborhoods with the exception of wealthy areas desperate to include &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re talking about NYC here and nowhere else. </p>

<p>Those &#8220;Guido type Italians&#8221; as you call them have been in NYC for decades in areas such as Howard Beach, Bensonhurst, parts of the Bronx and Staten Island. Even during their era of &#8220;the mob&#8221; they weren&rsquo;t running around the city shooting at random, raping and assaulting non-Italo-Americans. They are the same types that were found in other east coast cities; Boston, Baltimore, Trenton, Jersey City, <br>
and in Philadelphia especially South Philly which was quite a safe place during those days because those &#8221; guidos&#8221; kept things under control. In Atlantic City&rsquo;s &#8220;Ducktown&#8221;section that was the home of some of the noted mobsters, Georgia and Mississippi avenues were two of the safest places in the City at any time of the day. That has all changed with the rise of the Mau Mau. <br>

		<p>ATBOTL:&#8221;Remember that most &ldquo;white&rdquo; people in NYC are Jewish, Arab, some other type of Middle Eastern, Albanian, immigrants from Eastern Europe who are ghettoized, &ldquo;guido&rdquo; type Italians or gay.&#8221;</p>
<p>You mean like all those &#8220;guidos&#8221; from NY who fought in WWII, or in WWI, many fresh off the boat and back across the Atlantic into war to honor their new country by being willing to commit to it fully? Maybe the ones that came back and went to work and kept their neighborhoods clean, quiet and safe, pretty much like&hellip;white people? Or how about those Slavs, who did the same thing? Yeah, we can&rsquo;t have &#8216;those&rsquo; people going around calling themselves white, can we?</p>
<p>I assume you are a nordicist or at least have absorbed its ideas, so I&rsquo;ll address your post as such. You do White people in the United States no service by alienating entire groups of them right in the middle of the biggest single battle world-wide for White survival. I will not argue things such as non-white admixture in Italians or any other group. That&rsquo;s been argued here and elsewhere and the info is out there.  </p>
<p>I will also not argue European history and its extensive interconnectedness, including those Med (dirt+water) people. I will only say this, just to get it off my chest and meaning NO offense to those people of Northern European descent to whom I am grateful for having founded this country: We of Mediterranean descent don&rsquo;t need your permission to be White. In fact, it was WE, Greeks, Romans (and we did it again in the Renaissance) who defined what it is to BE White. And Northerners picked that ball up and ran with it. You can be justifiably proud of your achievements, but not at the expense of belittling those with whom you share real genetic and cultural ties. A little respect for your elders, please. Especially now.</p>
<p>Now you did mention White America specifically and there I will agree with you. When the Founders spoke of posterity it was clear what they meant. They didn&rsquo;t even include Germans in that as far as I know. It is only right that a nation define who its members should be and the United States is an English-founded nation. Your argument is correct. Except you should have made it in the 1880&rsquo;s, and many of you did. If things were different and Southern/Eastern Europeans were kept out at the time then I myself would believe that a just and natural outcome. But it did not happen that way and those that did get in for the most part held up their part of the bargain and respected their new nation. And now we&rsquo;re all in the fight of our lives and need all the help we can get.</p>
<p>When you talk of guidos you are talking about a debasement of all the culture. If I were cruel I might mention that the worst race-mixing offenders always seem to be blonde, blue-eyed Nordics like Heidi Klum. So lets not cherry pick defects amongst one another. The Mafia/Guido image is not the majority of Italians and that Danish model, I forget her name (&#8220;Black men have extra flavor&#8221;) is not the norm among White women. If I were you, ATBOTL, I would worry less about the number of Italians/Poles etc. (who are and always were a small percentage of the population) and concentrate on the real problem at hand.  </p>

		<p>Thank you Cid 13 and Mike 14. <br>
ATBOTL, if you were living in NY during the 70s, 80s, etc, you would know that it was us Italians that gave all the other &#8220;whites&#8221; a fighting chance against the blacks in the public  schools, etc. <br>
We NEVER backed down unlike all the other &#8220;whites&#8221; in the schools. Blacks were afraid of us and knew not to pass through our neighborhoods. I saw it first hand and lived it first hand&hellip;and carried it out first hand. <br>
I could tell you a hundred true stories of how badly blacks feared us and how we always stood up for one another. Too bad the same can&rsquo;t be said for our &#8220;white&#8221; brothers. <br>
So, you can go and thank the other &#8220;whites&#8221; and librals for allowing blacks to intrude, thereby changing the dynamics of &#8220;white&#8221; neighborhoods and schools. <br>
If only people knew how much Italians did in terms of opposing blacks and keeping them at bay. If you read every racial attack on blacks, the name of the offender ended with a vowel!!!<br>
Just remember, us &#8220;guidos&#8221; were what was stopping the blacks from kicking the *hit out of ever passive white person in the school and taking over. Remember that&hellip;</p>

<p>The effects of exporting poverty outside of New York City via Section 8 vouchers are finally showing up in the census. The ugly truth about cleaning up New York was that they were exporting criminal populations to surrounding areas far outside of the five buroughs, not just getting rid of the attractions drawing perverts to Times Square. Just ask the folks in White Plains if they are as thrilled with a safer NYC as the DWL yuppies that now live there are.   </p>

<p>Actually, if you look at the map provided by poster #9, you can see that there are huge swaths of white, working-class neighborhoods left in NYC.  Be sure to compare the racial map to the household income map, and you will see that there are still many neighborhoods that are both white and poor/middle class.</p>
<p>To those who would say that Italians, Slavs, etc. are not white, remember that they clearly are white, even if they do not perfectly fit the traditional American ideal of a white person being Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.  These people have long formed the vast majority of our major cities, especially ones like New York, and put up a better battle against the Civil Rights movement than any other group except rural Southern WASPS.  Any patriotic American should show them a good degree of respect and acceptence.<br>
