<h1>Civil Rights Survey: 3,000 US High Schools Don&rsquo;t Have Math Beyond Algebra I</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stacy Teicher Khadaroo, Christian Science Monitor, June 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To better diagnose achievement gaps and help education leaders tailor solutions, federal civil rights officials on Thursday released an expanded, searchable set of information  &mdash;  drawn from schools in more than 7,000 districts and representing at least three-quarters of American students.</p>
<p>The survey&rsquo;s data show, as never before, the education inequities that hold various groups of students back.</p>
<p>For example, in 3,000 high schools, math classes don&rsquo;t go higher than Algebra I, and in 7,300 schools, students had no access to calculus. Schools serving mostly African-American students are twice as likely to have inexperienced teachers as are schools serving mostly whites in the same district.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The data can show inequities between nearby districts, as well as inequities within districts.</p>
<p>In Boston, for instance, where nearly 80 percent of students are black or Hispanic, 13 percent of teachers are in their first or second year of teaching. In the nearby suburb of Wellesley, Mass., where 81 percent of students are white, 4 percent of teachers are new to the field.</p>
<p>About 1 out of 5 white students in Boston is enrolled in at least one Advanced Placement (college-level) course, compared with 1 out of 12 for both African-Americans and Hispanics. Wellesley has racial disparities as well. There, nearly 1 out of 4 white students are in AP. For Hispanics, it&rsquo;s 1 out of 6. Black students are 4 percent of the Wellesley district, but not a single black student is in an AP class, according to 2009 data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Part 2 of the new data set will be released this fall and will include information on AP test results, teacher absenteeism, and incidents of harassment and bullying. The data will also shed more light on which students are disciplined in various ways, and how much schools use restraint and seclusion  &mdash;  issues that have raised civil rights concerns in recent years.</p>

		<p>Course title inflation   &mdash;   Remember the phrase.  It means that the actual work being done in a class is far lower than the formal title of the course.  And it&rsquo;s a big problem in black and Hispanic schools.</p>
<p>Even if these schools have courses higher than Algebra I, I doubt much of any Geometry, College Algebra (Algebra II) or Trigonometry is being done in that class.  Oprah even devoted part of one her shows about it, she showed a young black woman enrolled in &#8220;Trig&#8221; in the CPS school, and took her to Trig class at an almost all white collar county school, and she was lost.  Oprah dug deep (!), and found out that her CPS &#8220;Trig&#8221; class was basically Algebra I.</p>
<p>But even if you discount course title inflation, that many black and Hispanic schools don&rsquo;t have courses beyond Algebra I isn&rsquo;t surprising, because most people (even most white people) hit their &#8220;math wall&#8221; after Algebra I.  You either grok math or you don&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>I would guess that the majority of high school students would not be capable of anything beyond algebra to begin with. Even if they do go to college most degrees do not require math other than what is required for that particular degree and there are usually several classes that would fulfil that requirement. With most college degrees being &#8220;fluff&#8221; I would also guess that most of these math classes are &#8220;theory&#8221; with very little actual problem solving. Also considering that most kids (including a percentage of whites and asians) are NOT college material schools would do better teaching kids to add, subtract, multiply, divide and balance a checkbook rather than factor quadradic equations. </p>

		<p>One of the bad things our present school system does is inculcate a contempt for learning in most of its students.  Hence, studying is &#8220;acting white,&#8221; in black parlance.  I read with horror what minority majority, especially black, public schools are like.  Why are we paying for this?</p>

		<p>Please do not worry.</p>
<p>Black&rsquo;s SAT scores are not counted for admissions, for it they were none would get into college.  Only white students will get rejected for not knowing mathematics beyond Algebra I.  When I was in high school most of us had Algebra II, geometry, solid geometry, trigonometry, physics and chemistry. Many high school students use to take calculus and linear geometry.  Most of you do not even know what I am writing about.</p>
<p>Studies show that only 15 percent blacks are ready for college even though over 85 percent are admitted.   </p>

		<p>Algebra in high school? I had algebra in 6th grade in Kansas (don&rsquo;t remember much, but that&rsquo;s my fault) I bet that any student in any grade of school now can tell us all about MLK and that would be about ALL they could tell us about. There are of course, exceptional students, but there are no exceptional public schools now though I had the good fortune to attend them pre 1965 you know.</p>

		<p>We took Algebra I in junior high, not high school!!!  Then we HAD to take Geometry if we wanted to get into a college.  Those who liked math went on to trigonometry and the calculus.  I survived geometry and took a &#8220;survey&#8221; course in beginning trig and probability theory.  The vast majority of kids today could not handle the types of courses we had in junior high and high school 40 or 50 years ago.  They don&rsquo;t have the background, knowledge or preparation for it.  I flat believe the kids of today are, for the most part, inferior to their compatriots of the past.  Somewhere on the Internet there is a copy of the exam to pass the 8th grade in the 1800s; today, kids with a B.A. degree could not pass that exam.  Standards have fallen, fallen, fallen; the older I get, the more I suspect the Brits were right in having CLASSES of people, or levels of society.  People are NOT equal in ability, and America is killing herself trying to make blacks and Hispanics equal to Asians and whites.</p>

		<p>The subtext of this article is that we should worry that blacks are receiving lower quality education than whites. But ask DeShondra if she really wants a white-level trig class  &mdash;  you can bet that she doesn&rsquo;t. And her mom is unlikely to know much about math and unlikely to push her to take challenging math courses. So if they don&rsquo;t care, why should we?</p>
<p>I care that my kids get the rigorous math course. But in a school district that adopts a one-size-fits-all policy, and that selects a size to fit the 40% of students who are African-American, my kids are not likely to get that course. </p>
<p>All of us should support voucher initiatives: it would allow us to get our kids out of schools geared toward &#8220;educating&#8221; students who simply don&rsquo;t want to be educated.</p>

		<p>Algebra has virtually no purpose in practical life, even for very intelligent people in highly productive endeavors. </p>
<p>I have an IQ of 130, but I had to take tutoring 3 nights a week in college to get an A in my one required quantitative and qualitative reasoning course&hellip;I realized in my Junior year that I&rsquo;d need 16 straight A grades (my last four semesters, to get a GPA of 3.4.</p>
<p>(I had blown one semester of statistics with a lousy C- grade, and got one other C, that time in my third semester of German). Other than that my entire (undergraduate) career was all A and B grades.  </p>
<p>And I went to the University of Colorado (Colorado Springs) when it was much smaller, and was an EXCELLENT school, academically.  No fluff. Small classes. Great access to professors, no socialist agendas rammed down our throats, even if most professors were basically socialists. </p>
<p>Now it is just a diversity circus, totally worthless, and costs four times as much as when I got a degree that was held in higher esteem than the toilet paper they pass out today, for good reason.</p>
<p>But I wore out about ten volunteer tutors, and aced each section of that one damn class&hellip;hardest thing I did in four years, got the A, and just barely missed graduating with a 3.5, but I achieved my goal of a high 3.4.</p>
<p>Got to graduate school, too.</p>
<p>I suck at all maths. </p>
<p>I have never ONCE been compelled to use anything more than a calculator in all my professional life.</p>
<p>For those who will be engineers, they need maths. They will obtain these by going to all white schools, or getting tutored whilst being homeschooled. Public schools in even Colorado Springs are now officially welfare pens for the Latin American and other-third world invaders. Now schools openly advertise in multiple languages that FREE LUNCHES WILL BE PROVIDED ALL SUMMER LONG FOR EVERYONE 18 ANY YOUNGER. </p>
<p>For the dregs in public schools, the flotsam and jetsam of the third world, who the hell cares? We&rsquo;ll be either wiping their arses, or running from them to more pastoral, all white environs. All those people need is a bottle of Colt 45.<br/>

		<p>As usual, the problem is allagendly everything and anything BUT the black students themselves! </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;students had no access to calculus.&#8221; Oh yes, that&rsquo;s clearly an issue - becasue students who cannot read beyond the third-grade level or complete basic mathematics courses at more than the 20th percentile, are ever so likely to excel at calculus!! </p>

		<p>Standards truly have dropped. Back when I was going through grade school 25 years ago, the highest math class in Middle School was Algebra, but High School level math went through Calculus.</p>
<p>Interesting how they automatically chalk up the problem with black performance to white teachers. Always blame whitey whenever blacks can&rsquo;t make the cut. But lets examine their evidence. </p>
<p>Is there in truth much difference between a second year and a third year teacher (new vs. veteran according to the survey)? Or for that matter, is there any reason to believe a first year teacher won&rsquo;t work as hard with the students? If anything, the newer teachers work the hardest and are still fresh with the PC ideology from college dancing around in their heads; the older teachers are more disillusioned having seen how the real world plays out first hand, and more pessimistic about black students.</p>
<p>Also, is there much difference to the student body collectively in a given school for 4% new vs. 13% new teachers? Seems like a very small portion in either case. The vast majority of students will still be getting experienced teachers- Certainly this nonsense could not explain so many blacks failing at Algebra while whites are taking Calculus.</p>

<p>Unless it&rsquo;s a high school explicitly dedicated to college prep or gifted students or preparation for engineering careers or something like that, I don&rsquo;t see the need to require math higher than Algebra I.  Most white people won&rsquo;t use anything more complicated than simple algebra in their day to day adult lives, in fact, a majority of white people hit their math wall after Alg I.  Are we to condemn them to a life of having a scarlett letter &#8220;D&#8221; for &#8220;Dropout&#8221; branded on their foreheads just because they&rsquo;re average white people?  Meanwhile, if you&rsquo;re not exceptionally good at math, you might as well be bad at it, because there are only a small coterie of professions where being very good at math but not exceptional can get you by, one of which I happen to be in.  While I do think the ability to grok math is an important proxy for one&rsquo;s g-factor, therefore his or her ability to absorb other complicated material in other topics, I think that any person, especially any white person, who can understand high school algebra is well qualified to do a majority of jobs in this country.</p>
<p>Like I said, everybody has a &#8220;math wall,&#8221; I hit mine at my first differential equations course.  Luckily I passed it, had the sense enough not to go any further, and that was enough math to fulfill my accounting requirements, even though complicated math is only necessary while performing audits   &mdash;   Most of the time, even CPAs (I&rsquo;m not one yet, I need a few more years of work experience in accounting/auditing to be able to sit for the CPA) only use arithmetic.</p>

		<p>No math beyond Algebra I.  Really funny.  </p>
<p>Anybody who couldn&rsquo;t pass basic advanced mathematics has no business in school to begin with and should consider a trade or janitorial work.</p>
<p>Let me guess why this policy was instituted.  Could it be that this is just one more dumbed down policy because blacks can&rsquo;t do the work?  Oh, heaven forbid.</p>
<p>What is even funnier is that it is black who are protesting the policy, apparently deluded that blacks could compete.  Probably what they had in mind was pushing blacks through whether or not they could do the work, then be able say X number of blacks completed Algebra II&hellip;or whatever.</p>
<p>There are no good statistics about blacks that aren&rsquo;t a pack of lies. </p>

		<p>In my old school district, an &#8220;average&#8221; student had pre-algebra in 8th grade, Algebra I in 9th, Geometry in 10th, Algebra II in 11th, and so on.</p>
<p>I was in &#8220;honors&#8221; math, which basically means you&rsquo;re a year ahead, so I had pre-algebra in 7th grade.</p>
<p>I do not remember seeing any blacks in my honors math classes.  For the most part they were in basic math.</p>

I have talked to several high school mathematics teachers, one of whom posts here, who have told me that many teenagers, and most blacks, cannot learn anything beyond Algebra I. It does not matter how the subjects are taught.<br/>
 <br/>
The reason predominately black public schools have difficulty attracting and keeping experienced teachers is because most of these schools are dangerous places where little learning can take place because juvenile delinquents violently interfere with their own education and the education of those who are trying to learn.<br/>
 <br/>
Most public school teachers who are assigned to predominately black schools, and who do not give up on teaching, transfer to white and Asian schools as soon as they are able to.  <br/>

		<p>Some of the requirements for degrees are a little on the insane side. Admission for most pharmacy schools requires Calc II, some of them even require Analytical Math (which means you suffer through Algebra I, Trigonometry, Calculus I-II-III, Statistics [an actual useful course], and then Analytical Math.  I was lucky in that the school I went to had a combined course for Algebra &amp; Trigonometry, and a combined course for Statistics &amp; Analytical Math. However, a lot of pharmacy schools wouldn&rsquo;t accept those combined classes, so it did limit where I went. </p>
<p>The failure rate for Calculus I at college is around 50% the first time through. I struggled getting through Calculus the first time, and got a C. My high school didn&rsquo;t cover it, but they did cover Trigonometry. I ended up retaking Calculus I to get a better grade. I don&rsquo;t know how much difference there is black/white on that as there were not a lot of blacks taking Calculus. The 50% ratio seemed to hold true for the few blacks that were in my Calc I class as well as for the white students. Blacks were largely absent from Calculus II, III, Analytical Math, and Statistics. The handful of black students that started out on the engineering path usually decided on a different course after suffering through Algebra, Precalculus, or Calc I. The other big washout classes for the engineers were Engineering Physics I &amp; II, and General Chemistry I &amp; II (which are far more difficult courses than organic chemistry I &amp; II in my experience!) </p>
<p>Other than a little bit of Algebra, a few formulas from Trigonometry, and a handful of concepts from Statistics I haven&rsquo;t had cause to use the higher math that was required. I certainly don&rsquo;t use it doing community pharmacy. </p>
<p>A lot of kids would be better served by skipping the last 2 years of high school entirely, and just going on to a community college. Most of the &#8220;college level&#8221; courses in high school wont transfer for anything meaningful anyway. They might help you with a business degree, but no medical school I know of will accept them.  So save the time, and skip the last two years, and *maybe* you can get the high school to pay for it to boot. </p>

		<p>The reason the experienced teachers go to the white schools is that they are experienced. They have taught at the black ones and will quit teaching before going back there again. The reason it is all new and relatively inexperienced teachers at black schools is that they have not as yet learned never to teach at a black school.</p>

<p>Let me say that I do not intend this as an insult and at the risk of starting some online keyboard warrior rivalry; you have an IQ of 130, but had a hard time getting an A in qualitative and quantative reasoning? If I&rsquo;m not mistaken IQ tests are supposed to measure the ability to reason and think critically. You also say you&rsquo;re not good at any math. If it is one thing I&rsquo;ve experience consistently, it is that bright people are good at most things they do, and great on what they focus on. Could it be that in your case the IQ test measures more than there actually is? An IQ test like any good test has high test validity, but not perfect validity. </p>
<p>The Moral of the story: The reason for your success, at least as it stands out from your post, does not seem to be superior aptitude, but an excellent work ethic. I commend you on that. If more people followed your ethic, our brightest educational sophists could stop looking for the ever mysterious achievement gap.</p>
<p>BTW, I totally agree that math beyond arithmetic and basic algebra is practically useless in everyday life. Unless you&rsquo;re daily life involves STEM. </p>

		<p>I tried to teach 8th grade pre-algebra to lower-class white students.  The major part of the course is solving one and two step equations.  It requires that the students understand how negative numbers work and how to complete all operations with fractions.</p>
<p>Many of the students did not know their multiplication tables, did not understand how to subtract negative numbers from negative numbers, or how to do any operations on fractions.  </p>
<p>They would not take notes (this sucks), work problems in class(this is boring), complete homework(it bites), and most of them did poorly on exams.  They would literally fall out of their seats laughing during class for no reason, and would cuss me out at a the drop of a hat.  I am no longer teaching algebra, and I am so afraid for the future of this country I have trouble sleeping at night.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t the schools want the new, vibrant teachers in their school districts? The ones who have experienced the intense curriculum of most updated colleges classes? It is merely a race issues; the Blacks use this as discrimination, to further their little thoughts that they are somehow being discriminated towards. It is all a somewhat vicious cycle  &mdash;  because the blacks are poor, they have no insurance; because the blacks are poor, they have no food or nourishment for their kids; because the blacks are poor, they get sub-par education. It is all a game of dominoes  &mdash;  a game that&rsquo;s currency of money. It is logical that a school that charges tuition will have better teacher. Not only do they make more money, but their syllabus&rsquo; do not have to conform to that of others; they can teach what they want, how they want. Everything falls back onto the money trail  &mdash;  the rich run the country, because of their education an wealth. I am not saying that this is the prime logic for running the country, but as things are right now, it is the best we have.</p>

		<p>With math, racial differences become glaringly obvious very quickly.</p>
<p>Most NAMs flame out long before they hit Algebra I as the vast majority cannot master fractions or decimals or grasp positive vs. negative numbers, let alone the changing nature of a variable in an algebraic expression.</p>
<p>Algebra is racist, you see, only unfolding its secrets and allowing understanding to those with IQs several standard deviations above 85-90, which excludes blacks and hispanics, leaving them floundering helplessly in the wake of a polynomial or quadratic equation.</p>
<p>Algebra traditionally was not taught until the 9th grade because the old &#8220;racist&#8221; educational system (the one that tracked students by ability level)  felt that most students were not cognitively ready to understand the abstractions of algebra until high school.  Algebra has now been pushed down to the 7th grade (sometimes 8th) with dismal results except for those non-NAMs able to comprehend it.</p>
<p><i>In 2007, after the large increase in the number of California eighth graders taking Algebra I,  they lagged behind the national average by ten points.</i></p>
<p>The real problem is government-enforced dogma that claims all students are equal in every way.</p>

		<p>I agree with &#8220;Keyboard Warrior&#8221;  &mdash;  if you truly have an IQ of 130, that puts you in the upper 3% of the entire population, and Algebra shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a challenge to you.  I went to a private high school where the entrance exam was an IQ test, and you had to score at least 130 to go to the school.  Not surprisingly, there were only 15 people in my graduating class  &mdash;  and I don&rsquo;t recall anyone struggling with Calculus, let alone any of the other mathematics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with the average Black IQ being around 85, basic Algebra would, in fact, be an insurmountable challenge for them.  A White student with an IQ of only 85 would be put in special education classes, and no one would ever expect them to take Algebra, let alone pass it.  </p>
<p>While the Black student with an 85 IQ is told he can be anything he wants to be, including President, the White student with an 85 IQ will probably find himself in an assisted living situation and work at Wal-Mart gathering shopping carts in the parking lot.  This hypocrisy accomplishes nothing but to create hostility in the majority of Blacks who fail to live up to these hopelessly unrealistic expectations.</p>

		<p>I have a co-worker who taught part time at one of these colleges that is slightly above a diploma mill. This &#8220;college&#8221; has a large number of minorities and most of the students would be hard pressed to make it through Ivy Tech (Indiana&rsquo;s Community College System). This man taught a few sessions of PRE-ALGEBRA (this is for a college, no less). The reactions were similar to those of Ex-WV teacher. Most of his students were over 25; many had at least 2 or 3 kids paid for by welfare. Simply put, most of these students had no business being in college or probably even high school. At the time, the man was between jobs and needed a somewhat reliable although modest stream of income. White males are expendable, until you run out of them and your city looks like Detroit. </p>
<p>As an aside, I&rsquo;m not great at math and hit the wall with Calculus. </p>

		<p><i>It is logical that a school that charges tuition will have better teacher. Not only do they make more money, but their syllabus&rsquo; do not have to conform to that of others; they can teach what they want, how they want.</i></p>
<p>Except in rare instances, private school teachers make far less money, at least $10 –15,000 less at a minimum, than their public school counterparts.</p>
<p>According to the National Center for Educational Statistics:</p>
<p><i>In 2007–08, the average annual base salary of regular full-time public school teachers ($49,600) was higher than the average annual base salary of regular full-time private school teachers ($36,300).</i></p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/ABxrA" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/ABxrA</a></p>
<p>Many public school teachers start out in private schools until they finish their teaching credentials.</p>
<p><i>Private schools are known to hire non-certified teachers. While some private schools require teachers to be certified, many do not.</i></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if fingerprints and a background check are mandated as they are for public school teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers are attracted to private schools because any parent that pays tuition has an immediate vested interest in his/her child&rsquo;s education.  Private schools also have the option of expelling disruptive and/or unruly students; public schools are mandated by law to accept any student (one former private, now public, school teacher told me they&rsquo;d wait until the non-refundable tuition check was cashed before kicking the miscreant out  &mdash;   straight to a public school).</p>
<p>And, private school teachers certainly cannot teach &#8220;what and how they want&#8221;; they too must follow guidelines set by the school which itself is driven by the demands of parents who are paying the school&rsquo;s light bills and salaries. </p>
<p>Parents enroll their children in private schools precisely to ensure that they receive a good, solid educational background   &mdash;   something the public schools generally no longer do.</p>

		<p>There is so much to say here.  My, my, my&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;The survey&rsquo;s data show, as never before, the education inequities that hold various groups of students back.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -Look at the phraseology. The implication is that &#8220;someone&#8221; is &#8220;holding them back.&#8221;  This is the liberal way of looking at life.  There is always an anonymous &#8220;somebody&#8221; to blame for minority failure, even in places with few or even no white people, such as Detroit, DC, LA or Atlanta.</p>
<p>Who, one would ask, is &#8220;holding &#8216;them&rsquo; back?&#8221;  Is it the evil, racist teachers?  They don&rsquo;t decide which courses are offered.  Admins do.  Most teachers these days fall all over themselves for diversity and passing DeQuan and Shaquanda no matter the subterfuge.  I have seen this for many years now and am no longer phased by what I see.  </p>
<p>So are the admins evil and racist?  They are pretty much on board with the multi-culti, social justice, diversity thing.  They also take their marching orders from school boards, which have a lot of &#8216;community organizers&rsquo; on them.  So who is &#8220;holding&#8221; them back?</p>
<p>Well, when you offer advanced classes in high school, there has to be someone qualified to take them and at least half or more need to pass.  But blacks and latinos don&rsquo;t do well in those advanced classes, so then charges of racism and &#8220;somebody holding them back&#8221; get flung around.  </p>
<p>Maybe we also are told that the students need a teacher &#8220;who looks like them&#8221; before they can succeed.  Well, those are hard to find, especially in advanced subjects.  So the minority-heavy districts drop those courses in schools where it&rsquo;s a miracle just to graduate a third of the little scholars.  Now the districts are called racists because they don&rsquo;t have the classes!  </p>
<p>So then they offer the classes again, and then massage the grades and data and pass students who have not earned it.  (Ever wonder how so many schools in urban areas, charters included, suddenly are doing so much &#8216;better?&rsquo;  Everyone is happy until the students flop out of college as unprepared.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re currently at: who is to blame for college student failure?  The Colleges or the High Schools. Many college professors, and I know quite a few, admit that they pass students even though they don&rsquo;t deserve it because if they hold the students to standards, then the profs are called racists, unfair, out-of-touch, ineffective, etc and get fired. </p>
<p>We high school teachers who are getting burdened by our job security being dependent on Dequan and Pablo have been doing this for several years now.  What can we do?  Gangbangers and hoochies don&rsquo;t come to school to learn, but to have a good time and get free food. </p>
<p>If I see a student who has a genuine interest in the subject, or who has potential or at least good manners, I&rsquo;ll bend over backwards to give them real substance and feedback.  But my latin kings, crips, ddp (dominicans don&rsquo;t play) and bloods students - well, let&rsquo;s just say I give &#8216;em all &#8216;C&rsquo;s&rsquo; regardless of what they do (and they are satisfied with that grade) so I won&rsquo;t get &#8216;popped&rsquo; after work or find my tires slashed.  And the insanity continues.  Try teaching in a majority minority school sometime.  You will leave heartbroken for the America that once was.</p>

		<p>I am only 39 and grew up in a &#8220;well to do&#8221; suburb of Seattle Washington. When I was in the 7th and 8th grade, we had Algebra 1 and by the time we got to highschool Calculus was offered. Almost all of the kids in my school were white and I can remember that most kids in my school made it past Algebra 1 before even reaching highschool, and there were 2000 kids in my school. </p>
<p>I am actually shocked at this article because it truly outlines how sad our education system has become. </p>
<p>It is truly childish and totally surprising to me that the author of this article hints that it is some sort of White conspriracy to keep Blacks stupid by not giving them more than Algebra 1 &hellip;. AND THIS WOMAN WRITES FOR THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR ???? </p>

		<p>I once  met a black lesbian teacher from a mostly black community, on her way to the South Pacific. She taught in a high school in a mostly black city next to my fomerly mostly white home town. She was leaving the United States to escape other blacks. In the high school where she worked, she had to constantly worry about being assaulted and/or raped by students. She deliberately befriended football players so that they would protect her from student predators. On her way to class, they would cover her, as if she were in a war zone. It freaked her out so badly, she left the country.  She told me this. I did not make this up. She was on her way to New Zealand. She advised me, &#8220;if you ever make it there, go to the South Island. The North Island can be just as dangerous as the U.S., because of the violent, racist Polynesians.&#8221; I have a feeling that black students, other than a small handful, will not be learning calculus. A liberal black lesbian reported this to me&hellip;not David Duke, not Jared Taylor. This is reality, this is your country&rsquo;s future. </p>

<p>High school math was Algebra II, trigonometry and four semesters of calculus.</p>
<p>In high school, I also had two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, two semesters of computer programming, three semesters of chemistry, and six semesters of German.</p>
<p>Of course, this was in south Boulder, Colorado, back in the days when the focus was on excellence in education, rather than diversity.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

Well, I&rsquo;m Anon#8.</p>
<p>Sounds funny, I guess, but you might take into account that some people have great aptitude in certain aspects of intellect, and (seemingly) glaring deficits in others, at least relatively speaking. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be one of those. </p>
<p>BTW, the WISC-R (the gold standard of it&rsquo;s time), was what I took, more than once. I administered many of these and other tests in my  psychology undergraduate research assistanceship ; in memory and intelligence testing. </p>
<p> I was mediocre in statistics, but excelled in biopsychology, neuropsychology, and even very rigorous courses in the history of psychology. (Theory, theory, theory). I developed a keen interest in psychopharmacology, neurotransmission &amp; brain anatomy, and this stemmed out into a great knowledge of general anatomy and physical medicine. But numbers. Numbers bad. Numbers hard.</p>
<p>(As a graduate student I took on the mother of all bull, History). OK, Philosophy is much worse, but, still&hellip;</p>
<p> Anyway, you may know that the WISC, in it&rsquo;s various incarnations, has had separate indices for fluid intelligence, verbal skills, quantitative skills, scatter indices, etc. </p>
<p>If my quantitative skills rivaled my verbal skills, my score would look more like 145, or one standard deviation higher. If my verbal skills roughly mirrored my quantitative, I&rsquo;d have scored one or TWO standard deviations lower, thereby coming in at 115 or 100. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim that the WISC is perfect, but it does offer a fair representation of my cognitive and creative abilities. </p>
<p>Simple memory is also a vital part of intelligence testing. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much you see, if you can&rsquo;t store, organize and retrieve it in a timely fashion.  Also, there is a visual component to math and abstract subjects akin to math. I can be shaky there. I think getting hit in the head too many times in football might account for that.</p>
<p>Another thing, 130 isn&rsquo;t so high. In 1987, the average score for a college graduate in the USA was 115.  Today, I know it&rsquo;s lower, because the pool of students is poorer, and the standards are lower, appallingly so.<br/>

<p>Sorry to say but I had those problems in kindergarten.  Yes, KINDERGARTEN.  No this was not at a school for the gifted.  The problems were written as &#8220;2 + [] = 3&#8221;, with a little square box [] used instead of the algebraic X.  (Or a cute little triangle, or a circle.)  When we reached Algebra 1 (eighth grade), we learned to formally &#8220;solve&#8221; those problems by a strict procedure (adding identical negatives to each side:  -2 + 2 + X = -2 + 3, leading to 0 + X = 1).  This procedure  &mdash;  not the mere fact that we could find X  &mdash;  was what made it Algebra rather than Kindergarten. </p>
<p>So, California teachers can do kindergarten math.  How nice.  <br/>

ANON #8 here, again.<br/>
Are you a troll? (Seriously).<br/>
Did you read my post?<br/>
History can be a lot of bull ( I ought to  know,  I have a M.A. in American History), because it is administered by professors who are mostly leftists, bent on leftist revision. Students do well by pleasing their professors, and professors obtain tenure by pleasing their superiors. Get it? <br/>
And philosophy. This isn&rsquo;t ancient Greece, pal. Most philosophy in Universities today, or  even two decades ago, is pure mental masturbation.  It&rsquo;s intellect put to waste. It is about as useful as  the atonal music of the early 20th century was. Sure, those composers were educated, and they tried to make something new (not wanting to do a second- rate tap dance in the footsteps of Beethoven and Mozart), but their experiment failed. Nice try, good effort, but it sucks. <br/>
Moral: the great philosophy you refer to has little to do with what I criticized. Sheesh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I meant. You might have figured that out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what your point is, and you&rsquo;ve badly misinterpreted mine. My point was that the WISC (look it up, for God&rsquo;s sake), which I studied and worked with for quite some time, smart guy, has multiple indices. It is complicated, and not perfect. It is however, a decent estimation of general intelligence. Through it&rsquo;s use, we have TRIED to remove or reduce confounding variables, but it is a challenge.<br/>
I scored a 130, and if that gets your panties all bunched up, well, too bad. I don&rsquo;t care what my IQ, according to the WISC is. Never did. I don&rsquo;t care that there are many who score higher (many in an absolute, not relative sense). </p>
<p>Did you see that I stated that the AVERAGE IQ for a college graduate in 1987 was 115? 130 is not so impressive. <br/>

		<p>&ldquo;Most philosophy in Universities today…&rdquo;<br/>
-Most philosophy taught at most reputable universities (even junior colleges) is: Pythagoras, Descartes, Leibniz, Newton, A. Whitehead, B. Russell, Kant, Hobbes, Hume, JS Mill, ect.; real objective matter. True some &ldquo;colleges&rdquo; and &ldquo;Universities&rdquo; teach gender, feminism, and queer studies as philosophy. I don&rsquo;t think anything else need be said about that. </p>
<p>-IMHO, the most worthwhile philosophy has been during the last 500 years or so: Kant, analytic philosophy, modern symbolic logic, ect., not ancient greek philosophy. Of course modern philosophy built on previous philosophy, just like math or any other discipline builds upon the past.</p>
<p>-The creation or study of Principia Mathematica is : &ldquo; pure mental masturbation. It&rsquo;s intellect put to waste. It is about as useful as the atonal music of the early 20th century was.&rdquo;?<br/>
Please explain…</p>
<p>&ldquo;History can be a lot of bull..&rdquo; is not the same as:  &ldquo;the mother of all bull, History.&rdquo; <br/>
-Seems your backtracking.</p>
<p>-I agree that politicized history can be a lot of bull, but history itself is not. You make blanket statements and don&rsquo;t qualify them until later. I think you do this because you&rsquo;re backtracking. From the onset one needs to define their terms clearly and precisely. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you are trying to argue when you clearly agree with me. I wrote in regard to the WISC and IQ tests in general: &ldquo;..high validity does not equal perfect validity.&rdquo;<br/>
You wrote back: &ldquo;…the WISC… It is complicated, and not perfect. It is however, a decent estimation of general intelligence. Through it&rsquo;s use, we have TRIED to remove or reduce confounding variables, but it is a challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-You basically reiterated my concise statement in a longer fashion. You agree with me, it is not a perfect test.<br/>
………………………………………<br/>
My Point:</p>
<p>I think your ego was hurt, b/c I pointed out that given the evidence provide by your self-reported intellectual ability, you probably are an instance of false high reading. It was not my intention to insult or demean you; I made that clear from the outset.</p>
<p>It is clear it matters to you what your IQ score is. When something matters to people, they share it. You shared your score. It must matter to you. You&rsquo;ve shared it many times, repeatedly.</p>
<p>In my experience, most truly talented people, be it intellectually or otherwise, are really humble about it. I suspect those that protest too much under the guise of credentialism. &lsquo;I have this and that degree from this and that college&rsquo;. A beautiful woman doesn&rsquo;t have to tell me or show me how many pageants she&rsquo;s won or how many men are after her to demonstrate her beauty, her beauty speaks and attracts on its own accord. Someone doesn&rsquo;t have to threaten or intimidate to show he can fight, his confidence, and lack of fear or ability to overcome fear in face of adversity does.</p>
<p>Lastly, you know you&rsquo;re losing or lost an argument when you resort to ad hominems (personal attacks/insults): &ldquo;Are you a troll? (Seriously). Did you read my post? &ldquo;, &ldquo;You might have figured that out.&rdquo;, &ldquo;look it up, for God&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;, and my favorite: &ldquo;I scored a 130, and if that gets your panties all bunched up, well, too bad.&rdquo; That last one made me chuckle sir. The things one says behind a computer screen, over the phone, inside their moving car to passing vehicles, ect. Anonymity and distance emboldens the weak. It was entertaining conversing with you.</p>

<p>(1) Higher mathematics IS visual.  So is much of calculus (or at least, is easier and makes more sense if one associates what one is doing with pictures).  If you can picture what partial differentials really mean, you&rsquo;re in much better shape for working with the Wave Equation, Heat Propagation, etc. (mechanical engineers and aero-astros on this site are probably well aware of this).  <br/>
    At MIT, those math majors who thought that math was all linear logic and clever algebraic tricks would &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in their first course in Analysis (sort of like baby topology), because they were hit by sudden surprise with the need to think in pictures.  That was the point where they either changed majors, or limped through the rest of the math program to get wimpy management jobs.  <br/>
    Andrew Wiles&rsquo;s proof of Fermat&rsquo;s  &mdash;  possibly the greatest 20th-century math achievement  &mdash;  took &gt;200 pages of algebraic topology.  The road to the proof began with translating the problem into one about properties of curves.  Every effort to solve this problem by means of algebraic tricks and deductive logic has failed:  google (Fermat crackpots) for embarrassing examples.  <br/>
    (I&rsquo;m convinced that future college math majors, especially at top schools, should be given some admissions exam designed particularly for them, over and beyond SAT I and II, that tests for precisely the abovementioned visual skills.  If they do poorly, they&rsquo;d be told to go to Podunk U. and/or stay away from mathematical studies.)  </p>
<p>(2)  Philosophy != mathematics as for type of abstraction.  Philosophy IS much more logical (though not purely &#8220;deductive&#8221;).  But, visualization is still useful (Utilitarians make use of economists&rsquo; utility functions and cost curves, e.g., the graphs you saw in Econ 101).  </p>
<p>(3)  &gt;This isn&rsquo;t ancient Greece, pal. Most philosophy in Universities today, or even two decades ago, is pure mental masturbation.<br/>
     &gt; Most philosophy taught at most reputable universities&hellip;is:  Pythagoras, Descartes, Leibniz, Newton,&hellip;JS Mill&hellip;.<br/>
     Not sure how it is now in 2010, but from the 1960&rsquo;s-90&rsquo;s, the emphasis was on &#8220;linguosophy&#8221; (word games with definitions and grammar).  The worst-case people taught that there was no &#8220;real&#8221; reality, only symbolic mush.  I suspect that things are improving and today it really is more Descartes, Newton, JS Mill.<br/>
     Even if you hate Ayn Rand, if you have any interest in these issues, do read her essays  &mdash;  she cuts through a lot of the nonsense wonderfully.  (How to get these Rand arguments taught in the schools/colleges is another issue, and another battle.)</p>
<p>(4)  THANK YOU #36:<br/>
     &gt;  It [modern philosophy] is about as useful as the atonal music of the early 20th century was.  Sure, those composers were educated, and they tried to make something new (not wanting to do a second-rate tap dance in the footsteps of Beethoven and Mozart) but their experiment failed.  Nice try, good effort, but it sucks. </p>
<p>    This is EXACTLY what I was always convinced was what lay behind the &#8220;noise&#8221; (do note:  fear of accidental plagiarism is another, somewhat legitimate issue here:  if you&rsquo;re writing random tones, your randomness won&rsquo;t line up with anyone else&rsquo;s notes).  <br/>
    But today, there is hope for first-rate flamenco in the footsteps of Beethoven and Mozart.  I&rsquo;m on the fringes of the modern-classical composer community and can see things are improving (20th c. == &#8220;backward&#8221;, even!)  </p>
