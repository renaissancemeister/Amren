	<p>Meddling eurocrats are demanding that Britain welcomes more immigrants to help the EU&rsquo;s struggling economy, it emerged yesterday.</p>
<p>European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom says immigration and visa-free travel are essential to boost economic fortunes.</p>
<p>The Swedish politician has urged member states to welcome more immigrants to help deal with skills shortages, an ageing population and a declining workforce.</p>
<p>Further immigration will boost the economies of EU countries and benefit their residents, she went on. Ms Malmstrom&rsquo;s comments come after Denmark brought in tougher border controls in response to growing immigration from North Africa.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;The Commission has been in close contact with the Danish authorities during the past weeks to ensure that its plans would not endanger free movement and would fully respect EU legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms Malmstrom added that she welcomed &#8220;the clear commitment of the Danish authorities&#8221; to act in line with EU rules, including the Schengen Agreement  &mdash;  the deal under which most EU nations abolished their internal borders.</p>
<p>&#8220;The full respect of EU rules giving EU citizens and businessesthe right to move freely will be ensured through continued monitoring and dialogue with Denmark,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Although Denmark has brought in tougher border controls, at the same time it remains one of the more accessible EU countries for immigrants with the right skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>Through its Green Card programme, non-EU migrants can obtain an extendable three-year visa that will allow them to work there.</p>

Absolutely insane. Yes, they need to flood what&rsquo;s left of Europe with Africans and Muslims to help the economy as Africa and Pakistan etc.. have booming economies loaded with skilled workers.  I have a better solution. Reject the failed, insane ideology of multiculturalism while providing incentives for young Europeans to have children.  Raising the white birthrate is the most important issue in Europe&rsquo;s history.  There is no skills shortage in places like Sweden or the UK, that entire issue is a lie.  </p>

<p>The EU is on the verge of disintegration and defaults in every country but Germany, yet they want to pay for more immigrants?</p>
<p>These multicult geeks are trying a smoke and mirrors approach to continue their rainbow utopia.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they know they&rsquo;re very near total collapse or are they just stupid?</p>

<p>On the one hand, they say &#8216;the world is overpopulated and it is irresponsible to bring more hungry mouths into it&rsquo;; while from the other side of their lying mouths they say &#8216;we need more immigrants to deal with an ageing population and a declining workforce&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Irreconcilable viewpoints -unless you add in the keywords left out of the Newspeak dictionary, (you know, like the one they leave in lower case in all those articles that capatalize &#8216;black&rsquo; anytime it is anything but a shirt color) then their message becomes all too clear. Even UN resolutions decree that every person has a homeland -with the unspoken addendum that Europeans do not count as people.</p>
<p>It is off topic, but speaking of the hypocritical UN; The UN has decreed that rape is a tool of genocide and a war crime; why -with circa 30,000 white women in this country raped by a minority every year (that averages to what, almost 100 every day) is there no attention being paid to what has become the most blatant genocide in the western hemisphere? Instead we get articles scarcely concealing their triumph as they crow about that blessed day when we become a minority in this country -less than a century after they coldly and deliberately set the course to Make us into one. There is no other real explaination for the immigration or welfare laws in this country (and Europe) aside from cold, deliberate genocide. In 1900 we were estimated to be nearly 30% of the global population and are already down to what, 8-12% depending on your sources?</p>
<p>BTW; can one of you tell me how you guys italicize words in your posts? I dislike improperly capitalizing for the purpose of emphasis.</p>

		<p>I vaguely remember reading about a former Canadian prime minister (it may have been Mulroney or Chretien) who finally owned up to why he flooded the country with immigrants. Quebec was pushing for independence and they almost had enough votes. But increasing immigration allowed them to maintain the edge over the independence vote. I wish I could find a link to that article.</p>
<p>Anyway, the EU has always been against the will of the people. And I&rsquo;ve wondered if they weren&rsquo;t similarly pushing immigration to destroy national identity and undermine the Euroskeptic vote.</p>

		<p>The financiers are grasping at the final straw - immigration- to postpone the inevitable devaluation of an over-inflated world economy.</p>
<p>It may hide the crisis in the short term, but it will also make the scope of future misery even greater.</p>

		<p>These agreements on immigration are organized at Elite levels by glad handing Political, Business, U.N. and other Elites, just like the way the Propaganda for promoting it is similarly organized. I always try to point out that these immigration Policies are only aimed at White European Countries, and White Settler Countries.</p>

		<p>Ms. Malmström is a known immigration extremist. She is unelected to her position and is a representation of the closed minds of the insular group that consists mainly of journalists and politicians. She&rsquo;s a neoliberal who does not believe in borders or nation states.</p>
<p>Sadly, she&rsquo;s the norm in Sweden and Sweden is, perhaps together with Norway, the two most extreme pro-immigration nations in Europe.</p>
<p>That she is the &#8216;gift&rsquo; to EU from my nation is a national embarrasment.</p>

		<p>Both Sweden and the UK turn my stomach. If you go to Malmström&rsquo;s Facebook page, it is full of her comments about the need for Europe to bring in as many North Africans as possible, and her comments are &#8220;liked&#8221; mostly by people from Norway and Sweden.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what they want, I hope they get it, and all the horror that comes with it. They are hell-bent on self-destruction.</p>

		<p>Ah yes. Of course it&rsquo;s a Scandinavian politician who wants to push this. Must tke more immigrants. If the bleeding hearts of the Western world could finf a way to engineer explosives, detonate at land schisms throughout the 3rd world, and tow the separate land to the North and/or West with all of the third worlders on the island, they would do it. And claim that it would save $. EU stands for Egalitarians Unlimited. This group is disgusting in every sense.</p>

<p>RE: the article<br>
 The EU is joke and completely unsustainable. The Med countries and Ireland should reclaim their sovereignty and use their location to make money off the manufacturing economies of the north - vice,tourism,gambling,tax shelters, all of it. The Nords still need somewhere to tan and swim w/o fear of hypothermia [sarc]. But really, they have prime real estate and simply lack the cultural will to create a productive non-progressive society.<br>
The EU promoting even more immigration is just sick. End it all for the love of God.</p>

		<p>What sorts of valuable skills do North Africans have to offer?  Brothel managing, drug importation, I can&rsquo;t think of much beyond that. And as for sub-Saharans, again, what is the skill set there?  Even the East Indian and certainly the Pakastani skill set is a myth.</p>
<p>What has prevented European countries from using their funds to promote and assist Europeans in having larger families?  The only thing I can think of is that the Socialist vision prevents it. That vision is one of a world utopia where everyone is equal because racial, ethnic, and cultural differences have been destroyed.  This requires the force of legislation and laws with enforcement, along with as many reminders as possible regarding the accepted vision of the evil white nationalist, who thinks he deserves a country of his own, free of all these manipulations and lies.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very doubtful now that the EU has any sort of long-term future.<br>
The Euro currency has been exposed for the corrupt, deceitful and pauperizing racket that it is, and it is only the fact that so much poltical capital (and therefore political humiliation - polticiansa can satnd many things but being humiliated is not one of them -) is invested in it is keeping the disaster story on the road.<br>
  That said the EU itself is a zone of a mass unemployment - this simply cannot be denied.I&rsquo;m sure that the 40% of young Spaniards who are unemployed would love to have first pickings on those job opportunities.</p>

		<p>There was a time when many European nations adopted a strategy of colonization for the sake of a national profit.  Those days are over.  If we can&rsquo;t go to them, let them come to us is the new business model.  Commerce needs only two things from a peron: labor and consumption - immigrants provide both of these. The color of one&rsquo;s skin, the language they speak, or the god they wish to worship doesn&rsquo;t register in the capitalist&rsquo;s appetite for an ever increasing pool of consumers and producers. </p>
<p>In this sense, corporate greed will naturally adopt a stance of multi-culturalism as it brings them more and more customers. So what if our schools are over-crowded and our cities are turning to slums - corporate profits are brimming.  It&rsquo;s the American way<br>
We as individuals need either to adopt this system, and make a profit from it, or rebel against it by creating a new model.  Just clucking about how much we hate &#8220;the other&#8221; will not solve much.  </p>

		<p> If welcoming mass immigration is so beneficial to the host country, then why has not the likes of Japan, Mexico, most of Latin America (and others who cling to homogeneous societies) embraced the concept of prosperity through mass third-world immigration? Are these countries not interested in the touted financial and societal benefits of massive third-world immigration flooding their homelands? </p>
<p>If the premise were true (massive third-world immigration is beneficial to the host country- or is that just white countries?) then there must a persuasive answer to the question as to why every country does not embrace this theory. If there is a persuasive answer, I have yet to hear it&hellip;.<br>
