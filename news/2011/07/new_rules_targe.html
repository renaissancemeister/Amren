<h1>New Rules Target Racy Vietnamese Cafes in Calif</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, Yahoo! News, July 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At Cafe Miss Cutie, the windows are tinted but not pitch black. The waitresses are wearing negligees but not naked. And patrons are being urged to smoke outside.</p>
<p>The dimly lit coffeehouse in the heart of Orange County&rsquo;s Little Saigon hopes to get a passing grade when police start enforcing a host of new rules to crack down on illegal gambling and nudity at some cafes starting as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>Officers plan to make rounds of the 37 Vietnamese cafes in the suburban city of Garden Grove to ensure they don&rsquo;t have arcade games that have been rigged to let patrons bet on blackjack and roulette, and that scantily clad waitresses leave something to the imagination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Orange County is home to the biggest Vietnamese immigrant community in the country, with sizable enclaves in Garden Grove and surrounding cities.</p>

		<p>I lived in Los Angeles in the 1970s when it was 87% white.<br>
The industries were McDonnel Douglas aircraft, Lockheed<br>
Aircraft, Northrop Grumman Aircraft, TRW Space systems,<br>
Hughes Helicopter, IBM etc Now Los Angeles is 40% white<br>
There are 2000 hispanic gangs, unemployment is 30%, there<br>
are 3 million illegals and the sources or employment<br>
are strip malls, strip joints, burger stands, taco stands etc.<br>
And lets not forget that especially &#8220;vibrant&#8221; culture of the<br>
Vietnamese..nail parlors and poker arcades. </p>

		<p>Thank god! Somebody is finally going to protect us from small, semi-nude women. Great job of prioritizing, fellas. A lot of police departments would have squandered their man hours on things like fighting violent crime and other petty concerns. </p>

		<p>Had America not sent troops to Vietnam, there would probably be only a very small Vietnamese community here now. Just one more consequence of the Vietnam war, without question, the dumbest, stupidest, most insane war America ever got involved in.</p>

<p>Do we also get to have a &#8220;Little Ia Drang valley&#8221; a &#8220;Little A Shau valley&#8221; &#8220;Little Iron Triangle&#8221; maybe? Personally, I have nothing but respect for the Vietnamese I fought, tough people yet still friendly when we weren&rsquo;t killing each other. I have NO respect for black gangs, Illegal aliens or muslims of ANY SORT.</p>

<p>Until the &#8220;new, improved&#8221; wars in the Middle East!!</p>
<p>We had a flood of Vietnamese immigrants after the &#8220;war&#8221; in Vietnam.  Will we have a flood of immigrants from Iraq (and Afghanistan and Pakistan and..(fill in any/all Third World countries where the US has &#8220;interests&#8221;))?</p>
<p>If you answered yes, move to the front of&hellip;.</p>
<p>According to Refugee Resettlement Watch:  </p>
<p>The leading refugee source countries for the U.S. program in recent years are, in order of admission numbers, <b>Iraq</b>, Burma, Bhutan, Iran and Somalia.</p>
<p>So, there you have it!!  Iraq leads in number of &#8220;refugees&#8221; settled into your neighborhoods in the US   &mdash;   AND make room for more refugees in need of US government protection, lots more!!</p>
<p>Dateline:  June, 2011:</p>
<p><i>The Refugee Protection Act of 2011. Introduced last week by Senator Leahy (Soviet-VT) and Representative Lofgren (Soviet-CA-16), this legislation would ensure that the United States continues the deeply-rooted tradition of protecting refugees, asylum seekers, children and other vulnerable newcomers.</i></p>
<p>You can be sure refugees from the Middle East and other third world countries will not be settled anywhere near Sen. Leahy or Rep. Lofgren&rsquo;s neighborhoods. </p>
<p>Yeah, the USG bends over backwards to protect, &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; foreign refugees by re-settling them into White US homelands, but won&rsquo;t lift a finger to protect Native Born White American lives from rampaging black mobs that specifically target Whites for assault.</p>
<p>Because to the USG, you are nothing more than a worthless Kulak, your life not worth protecting.  Sorry to keep repeating this endlessly but every White MUST be made aware of what the USG is doing to them, is planning for them, their children and grandchildren.  We are being race-replaced, folks, by a government that positively despises us.</p>
<p><i>Welfare use is staggering among refugees. As some Americans are pushed off of time-limited welfare programs many refugees are going on to life-time cash assistance programs&hellip;The rate of usage of SSI is at least 5 times higher than the rate of usage for SSI among the native-born population.</i></p>
<p>Could this be the SSI that is stolen by the USG from YOUR paycheck every month as part of a &#8220;retirement&#8221; plan you&rsquo;ve been promised? The same SSI that is going to support White-hating foreigners who never put a dime into the US SSI Ponzi scheme?</p>
<p>Yes and yes.</p>
<p>Bon<br>

<p>What did you gain from fighting them? Had we stayed out of it, 58,000 Americans wouldn&rsquo;t have died and 2,000,000 Asians might not be here.</p>

<p>Weapons training, ambush training, sneaky recon techniques, ruthless conduct, NO PRISONERS and I also learned how treacherous our own damned government can be. ALL of these learned things will be put to use in the coming race and religious war against the blacks and muslims. I respected the Viets because they did NOT give up and they WON! We Whites are in general, surrendering to the blacks, muslims and ILLEGAL ALIENS and our black run government at all levels. Our own damned government is the greatest enemy the White race in America has&hellip;next is muslims!</p>
