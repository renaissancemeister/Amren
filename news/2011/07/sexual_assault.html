<h1>Sexual Assault Survivor Tells Her Story, to Give Others Courage</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Linda Stein, The Reporter Online, July 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Beatrice Culbertson did not expect to be sexually assaulted on Feb. 12, 2010, by two teenage boys she thought were her friends.</p>
<p>It was a snow day so school was closed and when one of the boys sent her a text message to hang out together, she agreed.</p>
<p>They were supposed to pick up another girl and go to a park. Instead, Beatrice, now 16, found herself in the back seat of car parked in a Lansdale alley  &mdash;  where both boys raped her.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, a judge sentenced Tyreece DeKwan Lewis, 17, and Robert Marquis Lee, 19, who pleaded guilty to sexual assault, to one to two years in prison.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beatrice said she found herself taunted and ostracized by other North Penn students who had once been her friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be friends with everybody,&#8221; Beatrice said during an interview at her Hatfield home. &#8220;I was on the cheerleading squad. Everything changed. People are embarrassed to be friends with me. People who were my friends jumped on the &#8216;I hate Beatrice&rsquo; bandwagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although a handful of friends have remained steadfast, other students posted obscene, insulting and threatening comments on Facebook, including on a Facebook page called Free Rob and Ty.</p>
<p>When Beatrice tried to return to ninth-grade classes at Pennfield Middle School, &#8220;I had a death threat the first day,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Some students wore &#8220;Free Rob and Ty&#8221; shirts to my middle school, she said.</p>
<p>Beatrice&rsquo;s sister, Schyler, who is one year older, was also harassed by other students. Both girls ended up staying home for homebound schooling this past year and both need to make up gym credits.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The family met with North Penn officials several times and the administrators promised to put a plan in place to help Beatrice and Schyler return to high school in the fall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The first day, a security guard walked Beatrice to her classes and the next day a guidance counselor went with her. But after that she was on her own.</p>
<p>Lee, who was free on bail, was permitted to go to the high school. Beatrice encountered him several times in the hallways. The district offered to send her, not the defendant, to Northbridge, the alternative school, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a phone death threat, saying, &#8216;I am going to kill you,&rsquo;&#8221; said Tina Culbertson. &#8220;That&rsquo;s when I pulled them out of school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be happy, outgoing and funny,&#8221; Beatrice said in a statement that she read to the judge. &#8220;Now I hang my head when (in) public, just because I did the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said that she was &#8220;betrayed by two boys I thought were my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This happens here in the Detroit area all the time. </p>
<p>These white girls think blacks are like they ones they see on TV and they get gang raped by the dozen each year. </p>
<p>They just found one dead (Kendra Wolfe, 19) a vacant house in Detroit earlier this month. </p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/O1BtR" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/O1BtR</a></p>
<p>Even when they give a black guy a coaching job, he can&rsquo;t resist raping a 16 year old white girl.</p>
<p>Black Detroit cop sexually assaults white woman.  <a href="https://goo.gl/OLhYx" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/OLhYx</a></p>
<p>You probably thought I was exaggerating.  I could post several dozen stories like that.  </p>
<p>It is a weekly event here! Every time I see a white girl walking down the street with a group of black boys I wonder where her father is and how he plans to care for her mulatto baby. </p>
<p>But hey, the black men are not the bad ones for raping the silly white girls.  I am the bad one for noticing.  </p>

		<p>My parents, God bless them, absolutely prohibited me or either of my sisters from having anything to do with blacks, and we fully agreed with them on that.  One time, three Junior High acquaintances of my sister, after they graduated from Jr High, came a calling, one was white, one Latino, and one black. What happened next resembled a scene from All In The Family. I wonder what kind of parents she had? Must have been White Liberals. A white female that attractive is an electromagnet for predatory black rapists. She shouldn&rsquo;t even be in the same school as them.</p>

		<p>I love the editor&rsquo;s note at the end. That Tyreece and Robert Lee are black. I never would have been able to tell that Tyreece was black. The other guy could have been White, but there are rapists in all shades. And USUALLY  crime discriminates. Or the perpetrators are mostly the same race. And according to most crime reports, the overwhelming majority of inter-racial rapes are black perp-white vic. That is a truth that the MSM doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to know. But it is what it is. I don&rsquo;t like it any more than you do. But according to the Chicago Tribune, race should never matter in crime. Because who would really want to know what the assailant looks like, right? I&rsquo;m by no means defending police as there are a lot of rogue cops out there. But they have a hard enough time solving crime as it is, but now we&rsquo;re going to throw another wrench in your plans. No profiling allowed.</p>

		<p>This girl obviously did not know the FBI Rape Stats.</p>
<p>It would be interesting for people in mixed high schools to post these statistics on bulletin boards in the halls and watch the drama unfold.  Better do it on the sly though, because something tells me that the truth will not be a defense against the racist charges.  When the FBI Stats are taken down, as they surely will be, furtively put them up again.  You could save a naive brainwashed young girl from the most damaging experiences of this young lady.  Too bad somebody can&rsquo;t figure a  way to make the FBI stats go viral.</p>

<p>So she gets a text from a black thug to &#8220;hang out&#8221; and she goes for it? Sorry, no sympathy from me on this one. If shes &#8220;hanging out&#8221; with black thugs, she is obviously not one of us. What do you bet that shes another one of those that shout us down as &#8220;racists&#8221;!  And I&rsquo;d be surprised if she learned a thing with this incident. Look her up in 5 yrs. and she&rsquo;ll probably be a &#8220;babby-momma&#8221;.</p>
<p>*Instead, Beatrice, now 16, found herself in the back seat of a car-</p>
<p>How do you just &#8220;find&#8221; yourself in the back seat with two black thugs dear, how exactly does that work? </p>

		<p>Okay, this is absolutely and totally un-PC (by which, I mean it is TRUE):</p>
<p>If you are a White girl or woman you have NO Black male friends. NONE. They do not see you as a friend and never will. They see you only as a potential conquest, willing or otherwise. Do not delude yourself.  Not ever.</p>
<p>Of course, most of us already here know this fact. Make sure and tell all the women in your life so that they know it as well. Especially tell it to the youngsters. Break out the facts. Bring up the statistics. Show them this story (or the innumerable others). But show them. The last thing you want in life is to remember the time you didn&rsquo;t speak for fear of seeming a &#8220;racist&#8221; while you visit an acquaintance or relative in the hospital&hellip;or the morgue.</p>

<p>Snow closed the school but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to keep them from meeting each other and hanging out?   Obviously this isn&rsquo;t relevant to the topic, and it by no means excuses the blacks&rsquo; criminal behavior.  But school districts are way too willing to call snow days.  I think it might have something to do with bus and transportation insurance and legal concerns.</p>

		<p>I feel very sorry for this girl and place most of the blame on her parent(s) for not teaching her to avoid black men at all costs. My now deceased grandparents raised me and told me that if I ever brought a black man home that I would not be welcome there again. This also pertained to &#8220;friendships&#8221; like this unfortunate one. If I were her parents I would remove her from the school and file a lawsuit for failure to protect her from the thugs that raped her. I am sure the school is trying to prevent a showdown with Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson or the NBPP so they allowed the accused rapists to remain in school and offered the girl a slot in an &#8220;alternative school&#8221; </p>

		<p>One to two years for forcible rape?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to be the most lenient sentence ever.</p>
<p>The Judge must have been a radical liberal or black.</p>
<p>I wonder if the prosecutor was in on it also.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a law suit here, but I doubt that this confused girl will pursue it.  In fact, I seriously doubt she&rsquo;s learned her lesson.</p>

<p>I think white men should also heed that message, especially young white men.  I&rsquo;ve seen and read too many horror stories about &#8220;friendships&#8221; between young white men and young black men that turn out badly for the young white man.  It involves the white slowly absorbing ghetto culture and winding up in prison, or the &#8220;homies&#8221; of the black beating the white up or worse for one reason or another, usually pure racial hate.</p>

		<p>How about ostricizing the women who &#8220;befriend&#8221; these sorts?  I beg to differ with some of the other commentators, but the sleazy behavior that stokes the imagination of these vicious intruders is perpetrated by many, many white women these days.  I have come to the conclusion based on observation that great numbers of white women are no friend, but rather foe to white men.</p>

		<p>This wasn&rsquo;t handled in the right way. She goes through the humiliation of court appearances, the perps are sent in for a laughably low sentence, and the students in her school attack her as if she were a narc, not a victim of a violent crime. </p>
<p>The state claims a monopoly on violence; in return, it promises to exercise justice impartially. Here the state failed, utterly. It would be understandable if citizens reasserted their prerogative to obtain justice  &mdash;  it would be only just if the creeps who threatened this girl should feel sorry that they were so bold. </p>

		<p>I just don&rsquo;t get it. I am one of those &#8220;mentally ill&#8221; whites that with very few exceptions, has never felt the least closeness to non-whites..blacks in particular. A lot of the Asian and P.I. kids I grew up with understood my distance-most of them had vehemently racist parents (Asians are THE most racial of peoples, IMO). We hung out at school and that was the extent of our social contact. But the black kids always wanted more from you, trust, time, whatever. And if it wasn&rsquo;t forthcoming, resentment or anger was almost assured. </p>
<p>  As I got older and entered the working world, things didn&rsquo;t change much. Blacks asking you personal information, wanting to socialize during work hours and afterwards, asking favors, etc.,etc. I could always finesse my way around these constant demands. But I am resentful for the time and effort and mental stress of it all.  </p>
<p>   All other races despise us-some more than others, but they all do. There will always be situations in a mixed group that will have whitey, and usually whitey only..walking on eggs. And I simpy refuse to live that way. It makes more sense to make a life around my own people. A people that for the most part cannot come to terms with my politics.</p>
<p>  Like the song goes&hellip;&#8221; it&rsquo;s no easy road &#8220;.</p>

		<p>Remember,  the schools pound into students the notion that blacks are noble victims of White racism, portrayed as brave, intelligent, strong and beyond reproach.  Obviously no one told this young girl of the ever present danger blacks pose to Whites   &mdash;   or they did and she brushed it off due to educational and media brainwashing.</p>
<p>But what struck me most was this:</p>
<p>A poor, naive girl is raped and <i>students posted obscene, insulting and threatening comments on Facebook, including on a Facebook page called Free Rob and Ty.</i></p>
<p><i>When Beatrice tried to return to ninth-grade classes at Pennfield Middle School, &#8216;I had a death threat the first day,&rsquo; she said&hellip;Some students wore &#8216;Free Rob and Ty&rsquo; shirts to my middle school, she said.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Rob and Ty&#8221; are <b> convicted rapists!</b>  Why was this allowed on school grounds?  Where were the parents of the other students?  As a parent,  I would have been JUSTIFIABLY OUTRAGED if this had occurred on my daughter&rsquo;s (or son&rsquo;s) middle school campus.  John &amp; Ken would receive the first call from me!!</p>
<p>The level of amorality of the students, the judicial system and school officials is absolutely breathtaking and profound.  The rapists were allowed BACK in the school and were treated as &#8220;victims&#8221; by other students while the victim received death threats?  School administrators had <i> a security guard walk Beatrice to her classes and the next day a guidance counselor&hellip; after that she was on her own</i> while the rapists were treated as heroes by their fellow students?</p>
<p>Imagine 50 years ago ANYONE deigning to side with rapists over victims.  Our culture, or what&rsquo;s left of it, has been debased and degraded beyond belief and beyond repair.  </p>
<p>It is worse than I thought.</p>
<p>And, it is sick, sick, sick!! When rapists have all the rights and their victims, instead of the redress they deserve, receive death threats, taunts and harassment.</p>

She also knows she can not go out alone with 2 teenage boys of any race&hellip;.really.<br>

		<p>This is one of the most tragic things about the &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter&#8221; myth that predominates these days. So many white girls don&rsquo;t realize how dangerous blacks can be. The fact that she got into a car with black men shows just how overly trusting she was of them, and the brainwashing in the public schools was probably responsible for this. There&rsquo;s also the fact that one of the rapists was still allowed to go to school even after being arrested for rape, and the overwhelming support he received from the other students shows what kind of a social climate exists there. The publuc schools are no longer usuable. Private schools and home schools are the only options, especially if the public school contains more than a handful of blacks.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s a young, white girl to think?</p>
<p>For fifty years, public schools have indoctrinated our her with the politically correct dogma of equality.  They have twisted history to the point that she believes MLK is the greatest American of all time.  Thomas Jefferson - who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>For the past thirty years, the media has pushed race mixing to the extreme.  Take a look at any commercial on TV that shows a group of people.  It will be a mixed race group where the whites and blacks are all hugged up, laughing and having a good time.  TV shows that cast blacks as the smartest, most popular person in the room and all the white girls adore him.  Disney has become the world&rsquo;s worst show for white children with regards to race, imho.</p>
<p>Finally, the white girl observes her dad who spends the weekend idolizing the black athlete.  His favorite tv sitcom shows a black and white hopping in bed and he never says anything about it.  His boss is probably an affirmative action black and dad never complains.  He has never spoke to her about race and boys.</p>
<p>Then, one day, a couple of black classmates invite her to hang out, and she agrees because there is no little voice in the back of her head to tell her this is a bad idea.  She has lost her moral compass.</p>
<p>&hellip; and the blacks get a white trophy to put on the shelf with that basketball trophy.</p>

		<p>In reality, blacks are known for rape. That is what they do. What is interesting is that whites are not known for rape. The FBI even says this. Blacks rape 100 white girls a day, and this is according to the FBI. However, the FBI doesn&rsquo;t even have statistics for white rape because it is so rare. Anybody that says that whites rape just as much as blacks do is a liar. There is no proof of this. Here is a very good example of why whites are to separate themselves from blacks and other races. Hispanics are also known for rape. We love blacks so much, and they hate us. This girl needs to stay a way from them and get her self a white boy friend. She needs to keep her heritage and her blood line safe. Never to be with blacks and hispanics again. Because if she does, this will probably happen again. Blacks are animals, they have no moral conscience. These blacks that raped her should have been killed. This is what the Bible says.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting a big whiff of loose behaviour from this girl, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s learned her lesson at all, more likely she will end up dating more blacks and marrying one.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It was a snow day so school was closed and when one of the boys sent her a text message to hang out together, she agreed.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an adolescent female, hanging out with 2 guys is dangerous regardless of color.  White guys also take advantage sexually, just not as reliably as blacks or browns. It&rsquo;s like playing russian roulette with more, or fewer, bullets in the gun. </p>
<p>Guys assume that a girl hanging out &amp; flirting probably wants it, and the other students probably see it that way also.  They probably don&rsquo;t see it as rape; her hanging out with them was implied consent.  It&rsquo;s brutal but that&rsquo;s the way the world is.  Do parents not impress this on girls anymore?  </p>

		<p>Years ago rape was a capitol crime was it not?  Then we got soft.  Now its treated like a hand shake.  Wimpy attitudes replaced righteous indignation.  If we do not stand up for our women we are doomed to die out as a race.  I have noticed that the young girls with black men often looked lost and uncertain of what to do.  They don&rsquo;t know how to get away from the black dudes.  The girls realize that it is wrong but are pressured by society.  I recall seeing a blonde woman with a black dude locally and I knew he would kill her by his actions towards her.  He did.  Like a cult religion sometimes getting away from the blacks takes intervention on the part of friends.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Rob and Ty&rdquo; are convicted rapists! Why was this allowed on school grounds? Where were the parents of the other students? As a parent, I would have been JUSTIFIABLY OUTRAGED if this had occurred on my daughter&rsquo;s (or son&rsquo;s) middle school campus. John &amp; Ken would receive the first call from me!! Bon</p>
<p>Yes, interesting isn&rsquo;t it. The two alleged white rapists (Finnerty, and Seligman) from the Duke Lacrosse Team were ostracized and publicly condemned by many &#8220;concerned&#8221; liberals and radical feminists in the campus community; while these two convicted black rapists appeared to have had a fan club among Beatrice&rsquo;s fellow students. I have to assume that most of the rapists&rsquo; friends and supporters at Pennfield Middle School were black, of course, I could be wrong about that.</p>

		<p>She thought the boys were her friends. Well, and why wouldn&rsquo;t she? She has been told every day of her life that blacks and other non-whites were all the same, and equal to, if not better than whites. Not only that, but this garbage has been taught in schools and in media and in society for 40 years, so her mother and her father probably had the same message drummed into them from infancy too. They are probably scared witless of being called &#8220;racists&#8221; and are busy telling her that her rapists were just &#8220;bad boys&#8221; not because of their race, but because of individuality. In all likelihood, they probably don&rsquo;t know any better themselves. It&rsquo;s not just the very young we have to teach, but two full generations now, going on a third&hellip;</p>

		<p>I grew up during the transition time when the federal government mandated integration was in full swing.  I remember well how our schools changed when blacks appeared and it wasn&rsquo;t good.  Too bad this girl&rsquo;s parents didn&rsquo;t feel the need to educate her about that.  It may have saved her from this trauma.</p>
<p>I have 3 children who are now grown, but when they were young, I told them the &#8220;facts of life&#8221; regarding blacks and their behavior.  When my kids entered middle and high school, they used to tell me what a racist I am.  This is because the schools were busy teaching them about slavery, white &#8220;mistreatment&#8221; of blacks, black history, MLK, and how innovative and creative blacks are (laughing).</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and each of my kids has had life experiences with blacks that reinforced what I taught them.  I am so glad they finally came around to my point of view.  Now, if we can just get the rest of the empty headed politically correct to crack, we may save this country yet!</p>

<p>Young white females are socially insecure (well most all young females are, human or non-human) and they tend to be trusting and pleasing, most of all they tend to GO ALONG when confronted and do what seems &#8220;polite&#8221; so as not to make others uncomfortable.</p>
<p>By attacking this young woman you expect her to think like you do! They do NOT think like you do which is why historically society protects them! Men protect them! Their fathers protect them! They are protected so they cannot end up in such bad situations! </p>
<p>Oh but wait instead of PROTECTING them we can just blame them? Because suddenly they are expected to act DIFFERENTLY and the rules about &#8220;protect young females&#8221; no longer apply? Okay then&hellip;.guess the rules about protecting the elderly and children don&rsquo;t apply either!</p>

		<p>I think we should all be careful when we judge misguided white women. Lord knows there are MANY of them, but heck, there are as many misguided men. I should know, I was once one of them.</p>
<p>Its hard to run the gauntlet of the public school system without some indoctrination taking place. In my case, I always knew something was fishy about what I was taught. Why is only Western civilization bad? compared to what? But I just became angry and frustrated at not learning opposing points of view.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present, I have explored conservatism, and miraculously stumbled onto sites like this. Thankfully I am still young and I&rsquo;m less frustrated about the misguidance in University. But what now? Now that you are racially aware, you still live in a society that is not. In fact being awake, you learn that dark forces are plotting your destruction.</p>
<p>To those who are quick to condemn this young woman, I am well aware of your frustrations. But this is a numbers game, and our team is far too small. To those we can influence and recruit I say, &#8220;glad to finally have you on-board, welcome to the team&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Seeing as thought the bulk of the school is overwhelmingly white, I believe poster 5 hit the nail on the head. That this female just happens to &#8220;find&#8221; herself in the backseat with multiple black males would be laughable if it weren&rsquo;t so sad. No, I am not buying that. </p>
<p>I state unequivocally that I have no insight (nor does anyone else other than the people who were in that car) in this specific case. However I have seen scenarios like this before in my life. </p>
<p>In my own personal opinion, from my own experiences in life. My guess would be that the young white girl had a crush on one of the black boys. Probably the one who asked her to meet him. She jumped at the chance to hook up with him when he contacted her. (Don&rsquo;t be naive people, when I was a 14 or 15 year old kid, and I would contact a female friend who was about the same age, we both knew there might very well be some touching and kissing) She went to the car with him under the impression that the two of them were gonna have &#8220;hang out&#8221;. When she realized there was another male there she probably froze up. All the while they were doing whatever it was they were doing to her. </p>
<p>Being born and raised in Chicago, I have been familiar with white females who adapt black mannerism and body language my whole life. This young girl displays a tone of voice that sounds very similar. </p>

		<p>I have to add this little observation from yesterday, when I was out and about.</p>
<p>I had business at an office near a school where the kids were being herded to a playground; by a black male.  And I mean it was majority white.  But as I passively watched the parade, wouldn&rsquo;t you know, the prettiest little blonde white girl of them all, was boxed in by three black boys.  She was walking along, trying to just get to where she was going.  The boys were walking along passively too, but their look was not entirely of innocence. These kids were no older than eight!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize how young white girls begin to get worked on.  My wife had to deal with them in Jr High, but elementary school?</p>

		<p><i>She was with a race of people known for rape and other transgressions against society, what did she expect?</i></p>
<p>How did she know that at fourteen? How was she supposed to know that at 14?  How many average adults realize the dangers of blacks?</p>
<p>I do not believe high black-on-White crime and rapes are widespread knowledge   &mdash;   especially given that the media refuse to report black rape and other criminal acts against Whites or refuse to name the races if the perp is black and the victim White.  This is not in dispute; there is a lot of evidence on the Internet, especially here on AmRen.</p>
<p>Did the schools teach her about the dangers of blacks?  <b>NO</b></p>
<p>Did the media (TV, magazines or movies) warn her of the danger black men pose to young White females?  <b>NO</b></p>
<p>How about anyone in her family?  Did any of her relatives advise her to steep clear of blacks?  apparently <b>NOT</b></p>
<p>So, just where on earth was she, at fourteen, supposed to know about black &#8220;transgressions&#8221; against society or that blacks are &#8220;know for raping White females?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was a <b>fourteen</b> year old girl, the product of a school system and media that brainwash young Whites into believing that blacks are peaceful, hardworking and honest   &mdash;   and it is Whites who are criminals, rapists and villains.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this young girl had to learn the hard way that blacks are dangerous and never to be trusted!  For God&rsquo;s Sake, look at what is happening to her!! Are the other students rallying to her defense or to help her?  Are school administrators helping her?  The community?  The justice department?  The rapists were allowed back in the same school!  <i>With no outcry from anyone.</i></p>
<p><b>They are all on the side of the rapists!!</b></p>
<p>Are you beginning to understand the brainwashing process the evil media and schools are subjecting people to, relentlessly?  To the point where the victim is being vilified and the rapists portrayed as heroes! You can be sure if the races were reversed, this story would have been blasted nationwide by the media 24/7, marches would have been organized, demands for harsh punishment for the rapists.  See Jena 6 or the Duke non-rape case for reference..</p>
<p>Did you know that <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> is required reading in 9th grade (at least it is in California)?  This along with an entire curricula of White crimes against noble blacks. Turn on the TV for more examples of White perfidy/black nobility.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wrote above, quoting #6:  </p>
<p>As Anon #6 beautifully writes: <i>Make sure and tell all the women in your life so that they know it as well. Especially tell it to the youngsters. Break out the facts. Bring up the statistics. Show them this story (or the innumerable others). But show them. The last thing you want in life is to remember the time you didn&rsquo;t speak for fear of seeming a &lsquo;racist&rsquo; while you visit an acquaintance or relative in the hospital&hellip;or the morgue.</i></p>
<p>And I added:</p>
<p>Hear, Hear #6!!</p>
<p>Or, succinctly, Spread the Word and Tell Everyone You Know!</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t&hellip;who will??</p>
<p>You can be sure the schools, media and government won&rsquo;t!!</p>
<p> Whites are not safe around blacks anywhere at any time!! Trust them not! <br>
You will meet a lot of resistance at first, probably called a racist, but be persistent and keep at it   &mdash;   you may well save their lives!  It is the job of parents to protect their young against assault, rape and attack   &mdash;   now do it!</p>

		<p>I agree with Sonya at #35. I have a few young nieces and grew up with sisters. Teenage girls are VERY social conscious and when alone are easily intimidated and coerced. Im sure the boys knew full well what was up and if the girl refused them they would be harassed at school and probably ostracized.<br>
 Its like a perfect storm against them. They are indoctrinated at school, they are pressured by thier already indoctrinated parents, all media portrays blacks as pure as rainwater, wrongs done by blacks are censored and ingored altogether, any recognition of black chaos smacked down as racist. In order to keep fully safe you must be an outcast in your school, a fate worse than death for a 15 yr old.<br>
 As most have said here at one time or another, the only remedy is self-segregation. <br>
 Another answer is to toughen up our sons. I teach my nephews to fight, be tough and ignore pain. Weakness is what blacks look for. NEVER BE WEAK!!</p>

		<p>White nationalists/separatists need to unite and organize. We&rsquo;re growing in numbers exponentially, but we are still quite fragmented. If we organize we can become a powerful force in this country and in the world.  We need to start doling out real justice to black and hispanic thugs that attack whites (execution of course). Right now, they are winning the race war, but we can change that very quickly if we organize.  We need to ferociously attack back, and don&rsquo;t stop until we&rsquo;ve destroyed every criminal thug. We need to make them live in fear. It can be done. Think positive, fight and always know we will win. We are on the side of decency and civilzation. They are on the side of violence, racism and child rape. They will lose, they must lose.</p>
<p>Throughout  modern history, the evil side has always lost  or faded away. It may take some years of fighting, but death and hatred never triumph. Nazi Germany murdered millions of innocent people. Their regime died. The Soviet Union murdered even more innocent people. That regime died as well. These regimes were run by intelligent, powerful men with strong, advanced armies. They still lost. We are fighting men with very low IQ&rsquo;s that have the mentality of children. We could take our country back in less than a year. We are we letting these people torture and humiliate us? Little white girls being raped by blacks fills me with a horrible rage. In my life time, I want to see this completely eradicated. It can be done. </p>
