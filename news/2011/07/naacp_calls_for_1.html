			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Stephanie Condon, CBS News, July 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NAACP on Tuesday passed what it called a &#8220;historic&#8221; resolution calling for an end to the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The resolution comes as world leaders are taking a hard look at the 40-year &#8220;war,&#8221; and also as new data shows widened racial disparities within the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today the NAACP has taken a major step towards equity, justice and effective law enforcement,&#8221; NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement Monday. The resolution was approved by delegates at the annual NAACP convention in Los Angeles. &#8220;These flawed drug policies that have been mostly enforced in African American communities must be stopped and replaced with evidenced-based practices that address the root causes of drug use and abuse in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP noted that African Americans are 13 times more likely to go to jail for the same drug-related offense than their white counterparts. The resolution endorses the expansion of rehabilitation and treatment programs as an alternative to sending drug offenders to prison. It also endorses the expansion of methadone clinics and other proven treatment protocols.</p>
<p>Robert Rooks, director of the NAACP Criminal Justice Program, said in a statement that the war on drugs has created &#8220;a system of racial disparities that rivals Jim Crow policies of the 1960&rsquo;s.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a recent spate of hysteria by those invoking &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221;.  It smells like desperation to me, as the transparency of their non-arguments becomes evident to more and more people.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they instead tell other blacks not to take or sell drugs, so that Whitey will have no power over them?</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The NAACP noted that African Americans are 13 times more likely to go to jail for the same drug-related offense than their white counterparts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt in my mind that statement is false. Not only false, but brazenly false. It&rsquo;s a shame reporters don&rsquo;t question the NAACP&rsquo;s statistics. For example, if white David is pulled over for a traffic violation, is cooperative with law enforcement and the officer finds nominal amounts of drugs, he will probably get parole if it is his first offence. Black Rufus, however, caught after a long car chase, a long foot pursuit, and is found to have $5k worth of drugs, $9k in cash, and a loaded pistol, guess what, he&rsquo;s going to jail. In addition, Rufus probably had a mile long rap sheet, no license, no registration, and no insurance.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that this is the type of comparison the NAACP considers fair, and this type of comparison would be the only way their statement could come close to being true. Remember, figures don&rsquo;t lie, but liars figure. <br>

		<p>Libertarians have a good case for discontinuing the War on Drugs.  It cost too much but more importantly the War infringes on the freedom of people, especially with government snooping practices.  <br>
<p><br>
With White people who take drugs the taking of drugs is its own punishment, but Blacks are a different matter.<br>
<p><br>
The War on Drugs has a positive side since it puts Blacks into prison before they rob, rape, and kill White people.  The Drug War is a type of Jim Crow Law that is needed in America.</p></p></p>

		<p>If the war on drugs is ended  &mdash;  either by police ignoring the crime or by government decriminalizing or legalizing it  &mdash;  black drug dealers will lose most of their revenues because prices will plummet, and more black men will be out of &#8220;work&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve often wondered whether politicians are reluctant to call for decriminalization because of the financial impact on the black community.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve worked with several black people who were against abolition of the drug laws.  They insisted that drug use would then increase and would not even consider my argument that anyone who wants drugs can easily obtain them (especially in the black community).  <br>
Too many blacks always want the white man to do something about all their problems, but they always complain about the solutions.  I think the government should just form a great big plantation system and invite blacks to indenture themselves.</p>

		<p>The NAACP is saying the right thing for the wrong reason. The &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; should be ended. Not because of issues of race, but because it is a fatally flawed piece of social engineering, just as the &#8220;war on alcohol&#8221; (prohibition) was.</p>

I&rsquo;m all for doing away with the War on Drugs and letting blacks out of jail IF BLACKS agree to stay in their communities.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it. When it comes to blacks, it&rsquo;s always a lose-lose game.</p>
<p>The reason crack possession was given extra weight is because blacks in black communities demanded someone do something about the epidemic of crack users and &#8216;crack babies&rsquo; (remember those?). So the government did; stiffer sentences for crack possession.</p>
<p>You could legalize drugs today and five years from today, blacks would be screaming that legalizing drugs was a conspiracy by racist white folk to make blacks addicted to drugs.</p>
<p>Since these people will never take responsibility for their own actions, it&rsquo;s pointless trying to help them.</p>

<p>Notice the NAACP uses the weasel words &#8220;same drug related offense.&#8221;  That doesn&rsquo;t literally mean the same crime.  Another factor to explain the disparity is one that an AR regular advanced a few months ago, that drug crimes are victimless crimes (legally speaking), in that there is no victim who can be intimidated from testifying or doesn&rsquo;t want to &#8220;snitch.&#8221;  A prosecutor will often deal a slew of charges, including ones with human victims, down to one of the drug crimes, because the human victims are too scared or don&rsquo;t want to snitch.  The deal is that the prison bid is on the long end or the maximum for the particular drug crime(s), with the knowledge of everyone involved that the defendant is getting a long bid for a &#8220;piddley&#8221; crime because he did a lot more.</p>

		<p>Have you noticed lately how the NAACP is acting as if they&rsquo;re an elected branch of the government that has the authority to pass laws? I don&rsquo;t seem to remember going to the polls to give them those powers. Their &#8220;resolutions&#8221; are as worthless as their &#8220;diplomas&#8221; in my opinion!</p>
<p>In a sane world they would be told that they, and their &#8220;historic&#8221; resolution are irrelevant, and that as a black supremacist hate group they will be investigated and shut down.   </p>

		<p>End the war on drugs.  (I do not take drugs and despise them.)  But make sure that, with all cheerfulness and spouting of &#8216;social justice&rsquo; platitudes, we make it clear that anyone selling drugs or gangbanging OUTSIDE of the black/latino community will be sentenced harshly.  </p>

		<p> Portland, Oregon legalized marijuana. It&rsquo;s awful. The city is full of homeless zombies who smoke dope all day. They crowd the sidewalks and trams, making the city a disgusting place to be. Amsterdam, Holland allows marijuana smoking. The &#8220;coffee houses&#8221; are often violent crime scenes. They tend to attract criminal behavior and foreign gangs who deal harder drugs. Massachusetts legalized marijuana. Teenagers smoke it while driving cars, verbally taunting police. This system is a failure in many places.</p>
<p>Legalization of marijuana and other drugs causes lawlessness. The war on drugs should be escalated. Execute the drug dealers and send the drug addicts to hard labor. That would solve the problem. That is law in Singapore. They execute about 10 people per year for drug trafficking. That number is almost nothing compared to the deaths caused by drugs and cartel wars in our country. That is the solution, and the most humane solution. </p>

		<p>I still can&rsquo;t get over Maxine Waters calling the NAACP &#8216;non-partisan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I agree with #5: NAACP has got it right for the wrong reasons.  The war on drugs has been as successful as the war alcohol was.  Legislating morality always fails.</p>
<p>From a cost-benefit standpoint, I fail to see how the war in any way justifies its cost.  More prisoners to feed, more law enforcement to pay.  Ever notice how law enforcement always strenuously opposes legalization?  For them, this war is job security.  Come to think of it, it&rsquo;s job security for criminals too.</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;</p>

		<p>Demanding the decriminalization of drugs is one of the few sensible things the NAACP has done in its awful history.</p>
<p>Even so, they just have to play the race card by making the false claim that blacks are 13X more likely to get jail time for the same offense as whites.</p>
<p>They left out that the blacks in question get more jail time because they usually have more prior arrests than their white counterparts.</p>

		<p>This is probably the only time I agree with the NAACP about anything.  Ultimately the war on drugs is just another way to make whites pay for blacks&rsquo; lives, by paying for their incarceration and trying to save them from themselves.  Why bother?  If blacks want to destroy themselves with poisons, why should I waste my money trying to prevent that from happening?  I don&rsquo;t get it.  And why should I waste my money giving them free room and board (prison)?  Why not just let them fry their minds and die on the streets if that&rsquo;s what they want to do.</p>

		<p>Legalizing drugs would be fine if we were still a white nation. But with blacks, lots of hardcore criminals get put away due to drug violations. Stop the war on drugs and these type of blacks are out on the street committing more crimes.</p>
<p>Now if libertarians would also support more gun rights and laws protecting people who shoot and kill criminals then I would be all for it.</p>
<p>But, as we know, whites who shoot black criminals are often put away from longer than the black criminals.</p>

		<p>After 26 years being clean and sober, I see that it&rsquo;s pointless to try and prevent ANYONE from drinking and using.  The people who stop are the ones who WANT to stop, not the ones who NEED to stop.  Ergo, I say &#8220;back off&#8221; - let the ghetto blacks kill themselves off with drugs and booze without impediment.  Instead, focus on preventing the supply from entering our borders by cracking down on every single person entering this country from Mexico.  That isn&rsquo;t the only place drugs come from, but it&rsquo;s a big portion of the drug trade.  Cut it at the source, and let the users do themselves in and save us the trouble.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with #5. The war on drugs does need to be ended. It doesn&rsquo;t work and fills up the jails with non violent criminals. Save the jails for violent crimes. Jails don&rsquo;t reform people, but they do often turn the non violent into the violent.</p>

NAACP calls for end to &#8220;War on Murder, Theft, Rape, and Assault&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP on Tuesday passed what it called a &#8220;historic&#8221; resolution calling for an end to the war on crime. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today the NAACP has taken a major step towards reducing the incarceration of our brothers, sisters, mothers, baby daddies, and who knows who else,&#8221; NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement Monday. </p>
<p>The resolution was approved by delegates at the annual NAACP convention and &#8220;23rd Annual Soul Rally For The Community To End Violence and Stuff&#8221; in Charlotte.</p>
<p>&#8220;These flawed laws against murders, robberies, drive-bys, beatings, and rapes that have been mostly enforced in African American communities must be stopped,&#8221; noted Jealous.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be replaced with reparation payments and free Sunday breakfasts and cars and other things that address the root causes of African-Americans not getting their share.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP noted that African Americans are 73 times more likely to go to jail for violent crimes than their white counterparts even though African Americans commit 73 times more violent crimes than whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;The math speaks for itself,&#8221; said Jealous, holding a pocket calculator and showing how the word &#8220;ho&#8221; can be made to appear by punching in several numbers.  </p>
<p>The resolution endorses the expansion of pardons and the arrest of &#8220;racist police officers&#8221; as an alternative to arresting blacks who are found commtting felonies. </p>
<p>It also endorses the expansion of methadone clinics with a free home delivery program and extends unemplyment insurance to 19,000 weeks.</p>
<p>Robert Rooks, director of the NAACP Criminal Justice Program, said in a statement from prison that the war on crime has created &#8220;a system of racial disparities that rivals Jim Crow, whoever he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the NAACP&rsquo;s board of directors ratifies the resolution in October, the organization will celebrate for 3 weeks in Las Vegas. The NAACP approved its resolution on the same day new Census data showed that the &#8220;wealth gaps&#8221; between whites and blacks are worse than when slavery existed. </p>

		<p>Is this thought to far out in the field to even consider?</p>
<p>What if we offered to send criminal drug users to a beautiful island for a few monthes where food, shelter and most importantly drugs were offered free of charge on a buffet basis?</p>
<p>Most would never make it back due to an overdose, some would choose to stay longer but for a lot less money and manpower these people would be off our streets.<br>
No need to rob or kill to get the drugs they want !</p>

		<p>Number 10 is dead wrong. I have never done illegal drugs but individuals have every right to. Read Dr. Thomas Szasz&rsquo;s Our Right To Drugs. The failed 100 year old drug war is a war on the individual and is Communism. To call for an escalation of this insanity is mind boggling stupidity that exceeds the morons who brought alcohol prohibition. Singapore is a Socialist Police State,<br>
if Number 10 wants to move there I will help with his plane fair.<br>
Death penalty for anything but murder is barbaric.<br>
This is the first I&rsquo;ve ever totally agreed with the NAACP. <br>
You can have more than one enemy and you racialists who are statists are our enemy too. </p>

		<p>The war on drugs has been and will continue to be a total failure. Now that drugs are part of the social landscape (since the sixties) there is no more chance to put the toothpaste back in the bottle than there was for prohibition to work in the 20&rsquo;s. Whites need to keep their eyes on the ball, period. No Conservative programs of morality. They divide and distract us.</p>

		<p>The war on drugs has been a failure, but&hellip; within a month of legalization Je$$e Jack$on and Al $harpton will be shrieking to the press that callous whites &#8220;just don&rsquo;t care&#8221; that black neighborhoods are rapidly filling up with drug-addicted zombies.  &#8220;Somefin gots ta be done!&#8221; they will say.  &#8220;Dey be murdering our baby daddies and stuff wif poison!&#8221;</p>
<p>As an aside, the nation&rsquo;s loudest voices calling for the end of the drug war - so that people can poison themselves without police interference - are often also the loudest voices demanding that the taxpayers foot the medical bills for the junkies and the drug-addicted and drug-addled offspring they inevitably produce.</p>
<p>Ken (29) has a good idea about the island &#8220;addict camp&#8221;, but which island would we use?  Midway is a national wildlife refuge for sea birds, and Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals is likewise, but Wake, while still used by the armed forces has some potential.  Johnston Atoll is a very good possibility, because military activity there has ceased.  Palmyra Atoll would also be perfect.  We&rsquo;d have to put all the female addicts on Norplant before flying them out.</p>
