<h1>Ala. Churches Lead Opposition to Immigration Law</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Reeves, Google News, July 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For some believers and church leaders, opposing Alabama&rsquo;s toughest-in-the-nation law against illegal immigration is a chance for Bible Belt redemption.</p>
<p>During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and &rsquo;60s, many state churches didn&rsquo;t join the fight to end Jim Crow laws and racial segregation. Some cross-burning Ku Klux Klan members took off their hoods and sat in the pews with everyone else on Sunday mornings, and relatively few white congregations actively opposed segregation. Some black churches were hesitant to get involved for fear of white backlash.</p>
<p>Now that Alabama has passed what&rsquo;s widely considered the nation&rsquo;s most restrictive state law against illegal immigration, mainstream churches, faith-based organizations and individual members are leading opposition to the act. Some see their involvement as a way to avoid repeating mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what happened in the &rsquo;60s may be a stimulus for the action that you have seen many of the churches taking on this,&#8221; said Chriss H. Doss, an attorney and ordained Southern Baptist minister.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 56, the Rev. Al Garrett is old enough to recall some faith communities sitting on the sidelines during the civil rights movement. Garrett, who helped organize a prayer rally that drew a few hundred people Sunday night in Huntsville, said the difference now is uplifting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve thanked God that I&rsquo;ve been here to see the way people of faith are taking a stand on this,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After a prayer for wisdom, members of the Birmingham City Council recently passed a unanimous resolution calling for the repeal of the law. That same day, ministers and lay people gathered to discuss opposition to the law in the same church where, more than 50 years ago, white segregationists gathered to form a group to oppose white and black children going to school together.</p>
<p>Urged to come to a rally and candlelight march sponsored by churches and faith-based groups, a diverse crowd estimated around 2,000 marched quietly through downtown streets on a recent Saturday night near where police dogs snapped at black demonstrators two generations ago.</p>

		<p>If they want to minister to Mexicans and those from points south, then by all means go to Mexico and points south and minister to them there.  This just reinforces the foresight and wisdom of Southerners from James Monroe to Jefferson Davis that freeing slaves had to go hand in hand with colonization, that is, getting them out of the U.S.  Not having done so is probably the single worse public policy mistake in U.S. history.</p>

<p>Oh no, those evil white people forgot to be on God&rsquo;s side and oppose segregation?  Maybe, just maybe, God doesn&rsquo;t care about segregation.  Maybe, just maybe, and this is an even crazier idea, segregation and immigration are civil issues that should be discussed and decided outside the realm of faith and spirituality, aka &#8220;render unto Caesar.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Hey, it isn&rsquo;t just the churches in AL - the Roman Catholic churches all over the US are dead set against sending the illegals home, and they make no bones about it.  Of course, since most Mexicans are Catholic, if they stay it means more sheep in the fold and eventually more donations!  Looks to me like the Baptists are just following along in the mighty shadow of the RC Church.</p>

		<p>Missionaries and other religious do- gooders have brought much of the suffering upon the white world. <br/>
What more can be said of them, save that they seek to work out their internal struggles by acting like demigods. They are instead fools, and fools are dangerous.</p>

		<p>A urgent message for all whites in Alabama - as well as whites in all other states:  If the church you attend has a preacher who is preaching AGAINST the enforcement of our immigration laws, or if that church and it&rsquo;s preachers are pushing for Amnesty and all of the associated trappings, such as unlimited family &#8216;reunification&rsquo; for those illegal aliens who will be the recipients of such an Amnesty - also known as &#8216;chain immigration&rsquo; - then that church and that preacher are advocating for White European Genocide and the death and destruction of White, Western Civilization.</p>
<p>They are your mortal enemies, my fellow white nationalists and racial realists.   Abandon that church and make sure you tell the preacher why you left.    </p>
<p>As a parting &#8216;gift&rsquo;, give them a copy of the 1947/1948 Convention on the Crime and Punishment for Genocide and make sure you take a yellow highlighter and highlight Articles 2, 3 and 4.    And, then cordially say goodbye and that you look forward to seeing them at their genocide trial.</p>
<p>Tip:  Start &#8216;home churching&rsquo;, and refuse to participate in, or be members of, any church who preaches for white genocide.    And, this most CERTAINLY includes cutting off any and all<br/>
financial contributions to these churches, because if you do not do so, you are helping to subsidize the genocide of your race.</p>
<p>Its time to play hardball, people. We cannot afford to lose this battle, understand?</p>

		<p>Why Not? What cost is there to the church? They being them over and raise their membership and donation roles and other Americans pay twice the taxes because of it.</p>
<p>I was brought up a Christian and still feel I am one but I have no desire to belong to ANY church, they are little more than money making businesses today.</p>
<p>There was a time when the govt. did not pay for the poor and needy &#8220;the church did&#8221; but today all the church does is educate them as to how to rip off the system. Amen.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still amazed at the people who think we should overlook our laws and welcome millions of people here who are a drain on our social and natural resources, who commit many crimes aside from breaking and entering, take American jobs, who overcrowd our school and prisons, who take up space in medical facilities, who have made us a bilingual country&hellip;the list goes on and on, and with all that, we are forced to pay for the benefits they reap.<br/>
Why would anyone want people who&rsquo;ve laughed at our laws?</p>

		<p>These actions by Church Leaders are a clear violation of Biblical passage Romans 13!  Christians are supposed to obey the government, not work to hinder it!</p>
<p>Stories like this one, and believe me I have read many over the years, are partly what motivated me to return to my own ethnic German/ Norwegian religion of Odinism!    </p>

		<p>Many of the Christian Churches of this day and age are politically correct social gatherings that thrive on money.  Very seldom does one hear scripture from the King James Bible.  Most of these institutions have their own version of the Bible with all types of interpretation.     </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think what happened in the &rsquo;60s may be a stimulus for the action that you have seen many of the churches taking on this,&rdquo; said Chriss H. Doss, an attorney and ordained Southern Baptist minister.  And so?  We, as European Americans/Europeans, are having our countries taken away from us and now these worldly oriented and money wanting houses of worship preach and sermonize against us.  There is a great deal of difference in Christianity and these politically correct organizations.           <br/>

		<p>This is something that ought  to be considered   &mdash;   but will not   &mdash;   by those who blame mass illegal immigration on &#8220;The Jews.&#8221; If the organized Christian churches are opening the floodgates (and in some cases, individual churchgoers are  actively adopting third world children), then no one religion can be blamed for the ensuing flood. </p>
<p>By the way, are these same churches opposed to affirmative action, forced busing, speech codes, and the rest of the liberal social engineering experiment  &mdash;  all of which violate civil rights? </p>
<p>And if they are so in favor of civil rights, are they also going to oppose gun control, asset forfeiture, the TSA searches at the airports, etc? Or are the only civil rights to be defended those of illegal aliens. </p>

		<p> Black Africans were forced to American shores through the slave trade.  Illegal aliens CHOOSE to be here and have violated our immigration laws with impugnity!  Why these delusional denominations cannot see the difference is beyond me!  Perhaps they are just in it to fill pews and the offering plate with money? They are traitors to America.</p>

		<p>Reading such articles makes me physically ill.  Stupid idiots think that sit down suicide is holy.  They want the white race to sit and do nothing while the country is literally taken from them.  Allowing unlimited illegal immigration is suicide for the white race.  Not racism it is fact.  Such fools are doomed to be the victims of history and want to be a whole chapter in Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs.  </p>

		<p>Fr. Seraphim Rose (an American) who was a convert to Russian Orthodoxy, once noted that, &#8220;&hellip;In the End, ALL the Churches will serve Antichrist.&#8221;</p>
<p>After reading this column, the utter cluelessness of some of these &#8216;churches&rsquo; appalls me. From a nation that once held up the Biblical injunctions against miscegenation, to a church that now (heretically) thinks, &#8216;mixing it up&rsquo; is the next best thing to the Rapture, clearly, Fr. Seraphim was correct.</p>
<p>I, for one, preach and teach, that Whites and Blacks are not to interbreed, per the Mosaic law. Not only that, but I state that the South was CORRECT fundamentally in going to war over this ONE Fact. And that the Obamanation is just that&hellip;. before YHWH God.</p>

		<p>These churches want these illegal aliens here because they believe that they and their offspring will become members of these churches and contribute to the collection plate.</p>
<p>However, I think it will eventually backfire. I don&rsquo;t believe that most of these anchor babies and illegal alien adults will suddenly become religious and start attending church regularly. Once they live in America long enough they will not have much interest in religious activities.</p>
<p>The ministers are morally wrong for supporting illegals. The illegals broke American laws and therefore are guilty, not innocent of these acts. </p>
<p>In the end this seems to be about the money.</p>

		<p>This article makes it seem that all churches in Alabama are opposing the new immigration law which is not true. Chris Doss is a civil rights lawyer who helped destroy Birmingham and the city council in Birmingham is a joke. This is not a legimate artice and does not reflect the true feelings of most Alabama citizens.</p>

		<p>I sometimes wonder how long it will be before white Americans get over the so called guilt complex they have over that segregation battle of the sixties. If any of them could ever say that our country is better off now than it was then they need a good psychiatrist. I&rsquo;ve had more than one young Hispanic tell me that they&rsquo;re taking over any way regardless of what we think. Please note all the Hispanic nationalist movements that all have socialist roots. These people much like blacks have no intent of sharing the benefits of this government with anyone, they want the whole pie. These people are not our friends they are our mortal enemies. The current president of our foundering republic spoke today at a La Raza convention. These are dark times indeed when a mans enemies are members of his own household (race), backed by opportunist politicians who don&rsquo;t care one iota about<br/>
the future of this republic. </p>
