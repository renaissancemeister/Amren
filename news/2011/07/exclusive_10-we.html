			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Philly, July 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ten weeks pregnant, Lindsay O&rsquo;Brien says she never thought twice about racing out of her Market Frankford El Train car at the 63rd St. Station last Wednesday when an alleged thief tried to steal her purse.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Eyewitness News, the 28-year-old expectant mom from Delaware County says she chased Vaughn Matthews, a career criminal with a dozen arrests going back 19 years, down a stairwell, but when she tried to get her bag from him, he lashed out, breaking her wrist and punching her in the stomach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when O&rsquo;Brien says she drew on her 3.5 years of kick-box training, leveling a kick at the suspect&rsquo;s shin, shattering it in two places.</p>
<p>Officers say they found Matthews, screaming in pain, lying on the street.</p>

		<p>In many ways, I say good for her. However, the fact that she got close enough for him to punch her in the stomach, potentially injuring her and/or her unborn child, or causing a miscarriage, all over material possessions, even her purse, is foolhardy. She should have realized that an African felon would not be deterred by the fact that she is an expectant mother, if he could even tell at ten weeks. In fact, he would have probably considered it his lucky day, having gotten a &#8220;twofer&#8221; so to speak. <br>
What white people have to realize is that everything that we consider normal, decent and civilized is completely absent in these thugs. While we have a culture of letting women and children, pregnant mothers, elderly and ill persons out of danger first or having first chance at food or medical care, African thugs in every corner of the globe (remember the Haiti earthquake?) think nothing of shoving ahead of the rest, every man for himself, and devil take the hindmost. </p>

		<p>If I were Lindsay, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone public with that story.  Some prosecutor could find something to charge her with.  That is an awful lot of force just to recover stolen property.  Use of force is usually only justified where someone&rsquo;s life is in danger or a crime is taking place in one&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t O.J. Simpson go to prison for using force to take back property he claimed was his?</p>

I&rsquo;m glad it turned out the women was not seriously hurt and the baby Okay. She defeated the robber, got her property back and is now a hero.</p>
<p>But let me ask: If she wasn&rsquo;t a pregnant white women, but instead, was a white man who fought, breaking the robbers leg, would things of turned out the same way for him, as it did for the her? just by asking the question, you know I have my doubts.</p>

		<p>This Matthews guy is never going to hear the end of it in prison.  He&rsquo;ll be a laughing stock even after he gets out.  As for Mrs. O&rsquo;Brien, I hope she watches her back from now on and I hope she, and her family, remain safe.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad the crook got disabled and that he suffered injuries.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very dubious about this claim.  I have martial arts training and I seriously doubt a hard kick to the shin would &#8220;shatter it in two places,&#8221; unless the perp was an adult and the victim a kid.</p>

		<p>On a lighter note - when I was growing up(back in the 70&rsquo;s) it was commonly joked that if one was in a confrontation with a Black, there was no use hitting them in the head as it would have no effect&hellip;one had to aim for the shin as the weakest point and attack! I&rsquo;ll be damned - they were right all along!!</p>

		<p>It is not just a predator/prey world out there. There is another player in that game, &#8220;dangerous prey.&#8221; The key to being a successful predator is accurate prey-selection. Mathews failed that exam. Lindsay O&rsquo;Brien did herself proud, although a coup de grace bullet between the driving lights would have &#8216;splained it to the perp even more completely. Please note, shins are an excellent point of attack on blacks, as their bones there are thin, break easily&hellip;and painfully. Never waste your time striking a black in the head-area, it is like punching a coconut. Learn to be dangerous prey. </p>

<p>I think you&rsquo;re trying to be funny.  Instead you should be applauding her.  How often do we hear of a White woman who has her purse stolen, not just getting it back, but breaking the Black man&rsquo;s leg in the process.  Thirty-thousand+ White women getting raped every year by Black men.  Many thousands more getting attacked, robbed, and murdered and you&rsquo;re comparing her with O. J. Simpson???</p>

<p>Well, in BRA, you know run by Obummer and his clown attorney general, with his &#8220;People,&#8221; and all, it would not surprise me. We can&rsquo;t have white &hellip;GASP, WOMEN! shattering vicious black thugs&rsquo; legs, now can we? (Oh, it fills me with glee to think of it&hellip;I&rsquo;d LOVE to see and HEAR the whole thing&hellip;snap, crackle, POP.)</p>
<p> And big mister black would-be baby killer, crying for his mamma on the ground&hellip;priceless. </p>
<p>But back to sober reality&hellip;I think if charges are brought against MRS. HERO, it will only be as a front, to appease the DOJ, and their racist jackboot thugs.<br>
The local DA may have to go through those motions&hellip;ironically, it will cost them their job, as the public (whites, that is), will protest right into the DAs office, and have them recalled.</p>
<p>But the big pimp (Eric Holder) don&rsquo;t care, now do he? He gotta&rsquo; be keepin&rsquo; it real, and exacting revenge, whenever he can&hellip;oh, by the way, if he doesn&rsquo;t get fired just before Odumbo&rsquo;s failed re- election bid, we&rsquo;re about one year away from bidding the idiot (all idiot, no savant) Holder farewell. Guess he&rsquo;ll start up a black panthers chapter afterward.</p>

		<p>Just another good excuse for a flash mob, seeking retributive justice for the misdeeds of a white devil using excessive force against a poor downtrodden black male, who probably had aspirations for being a civil rights activist and who tried to get his share of reparations a little earlier than the rest. All in a days work for the vibrantly diverse Philly.</p>

		<p>She was surprised that a black, middle aged, purse snatcher was a career criminal?  What did she think, he was a Wall Street banker down on his luck and needed the money to feed his wife and kids?</p>

		<p>I guess there is a silver lining to an otherwise destructive women&rsquo;s liberation movement. Thank God that white women are still given the green light to defend themselves and their property because white men were castrated years ago. If that was a white man breaking up that criminal I have a feeling it would not get any airtime and the police would have to investigate finding out if too much force was used on the attacker. White men need to get their manhood back and help women like this when they are being attacked. </p>

As a woman I love what this 28 year old woman did  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  hormones increase during pregnancy giving us women strength and perseverance that we don&rsquo;t have when not pregnant. </p>

		<p>Minutes after this story hit the CBS News site in Philly, a black priestess tried to trash this heroine&rsquo;s reputation. </p>
<p>However, a White liberal woman, who wrote that Lindsay shouldn&rsquo;t have fought back, managed to post before her. It&rsquo;s about time we stop cowering in fear.</p>

		<p>I noticed a lot of white nationalist types have picked up on this story as a mark of pride.  I&rsquo;m not so sure that is a good thing.</p>
<p>It is debatable as to the desirability of women who embody female qualities exclusively.  Some men find the fey, &#8220;helpless&#8221; female to be the most desired type of women.  Few to zero, normal men find the absolute lack of female qualities in a woman to be desirable.  Some men find it highly desirable for a feminine woman to have a dash of male traits.  In other words, if I draw my gun to protect my family, my wife draws her to defend our child also.</p>
<p>But what is not debatable is the absolute necessity for men to be men and cultivate male traits.  Something our society has been slipping on for almost two generations.</p>
<p>It may be a good thing that a pregnant white woman is a match for a black who stupidly choose to molest her.  It is most definitely NOT a good thing that five or more white men did not leap to her defense and permanently cripple and maim him.</p>
<p>Women should not have to defend themselves.  At least not alone.  That they do, is a deep sign of some serious sickness in our society.  Where was this woman&rsquo;s husband or boyfriend.  Her brothers, father, or sons?</p>
<p>That is shameful.</p>

		<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m a black person, and I found this site to be very interesting. The only thing that I don&rsquo;t care for is when you lump all blacks into one stereotype; heres why.</p>
<p> I used to say of myself that if I was white I&rsquo;d be racist to black people, since they always fight, go to jail, and kill. Even as a young kid I noticed this, when I saw a crime committed by blacks on the news, I shook my head, and said, &ldquo;of course it would be the blacks.&rdquo; <br>
I&rsquo;m not nearly as critical of black people now as I once was, but a big part of that has to deal with looking at myself. I was blessed with good parents, who brought me up and taught me things like grammar, morals, not to blame others, and the value of hard work; apparently to many blacks this is being &ldquo;white&rdquo;. I know some blacks would probably call me &ldquo;white&rdquo;. But what I learned when I got older was that it wasn&rsquo;t that acting &ldquo;white&rdquo; was better than acting &ldquo;black&rdquo; because one was white and one was black, it was really because one was getting an education, another wasn&rsquo;t, in the simplest terms. Any white can drop out of high school, get some people pregnant, and commit crimes. A black man can go to college, get married, and make lots of money. I know you all know that, but my point is this; black folk need to &ldquo;act white&rdquo;. They need good education, and learn not to blame everything on &ldquo;the man.&rdquo; If they could be brought up well maybe we wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about them killing and stealing.  <br>
	As I said before, I was brought up well, went to a church of only white people, live in a predominantly white neighborhood, and haven&rsquo;t committed a crime, nor do I want to. I believe that upbringing makes a huge difference. </p>
<p>This was sort of rushed, so it may not be perfect. I&rsquo;d like to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>and to the first anonymous commenter, I heard of a white woman that tried to cut open a pregnant woman&rsquo;s stomach.  </p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re right about the fact that punching to the head is like punching a coconut, I was drawn into some fights in my younger days, and a straight on punch to the skull can hurt your hand as much as it hurts the recipient. Punch to the face instead, if you have to defend yourself.</p>
<p>One of the best beginner moves taught in some martial arts self-defense classes that is easy for anyone to do, is to make eye contact with the person when you&rsquo;re with in a few feet to distract them, and maintain eye contact while kicking them hard in the knee. Then leave. </p>

		<p>Love Her!! Prior to this incident, this girl has probably never hurt anyone in her life. A glimpse at this maggot&rsquo;s record shows nothing but robbery, violence and weapons possession. Seems to me, the true criminals are the ones who allowed this thing to ever walk the streets after it was proven he is nothing but a predator and a threat to society. <br>
He will return to prison over this. As a corrections officer I assure you that the specifics of this incident will leak out to the staff and other prisoners. He won&rsquo;t be able to walk across the yard without constant reminders of getting stomped by a little white girl. Unlikely to be embraced and protected by other black groups, he be a loner. This will provide an opportunity for others (young white kids) to victimize him. He&rsquo;ll probably have a pretty nice limp to go along with all of it so he&rsquo;ll be easy to pick out. Prison can be fun!<br>

		<p>This sets a bad example. Women should not resort to fist or even foot fighting with thugs. If they have to work outside the home,they should carry a double barrel coach gun around if they are in charge of money. She should have emptied both barells into his body. 32 00 buck shots meeting his brain would turn his fro into goo and we would not have to feed him for the next 90 days he will get from a liberal Obama appointee. maybe he will get Jose Baez to represent him.<br>

		<p>@19 - My heart bleeds for you.  Your problem, and the problem with the black community as a whole, is not one of a &#8220;few bad apples spoiling the bunch.&#8221;  Rather, it is a problem of a &#8220;few good apples spoiled by the bunch.&#8221;  You are a minority within a minority.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t brought up to be a racial realist or a &#8216;bigot.&rsquo;  I learned that stuff all on my own.  For every black person I encounter who is like you, I meet 20 or more others who are overwhelmingly disagreeable and unabashedly racist themselves.  My so-called &#8216;bigoted&rsquo; views are, in essence, defensive.  As a white male, I feel like I am under attack.  I think that the evidence, viewed objectively, demonstrates that I and my kind are, in fact, under attack.</p>
<p>While my opinion may not be in line with the rest of the visitors to this site, I actually believe that we&rsquo;re all being played against each other.  As it pertains to black people, I believe that government programs like welfare and affirmative action are designed to perpetuate slavery and loyalty to the left wing.  I don&rsquo;t understand why they can&rsquo;t see the implicit message: black people cannot do things without the help of the government.  If black people woke up and saw things as they are, I believe that racial strife could potentially disappear and the nonsense would end.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish that the world and this country were not as they are.  But things are not changing for the better, and my naive hopes for &#8216;healing&rsquo; disappeared long ago.  You are lumped in with the rest of the bad apples just as I am lumped in with the rest of the white folks.  Regrettably, that&rsquo;s just how it is.  In my affairs, everyone gets a fair shake.  Though I am more guarded when I encounter black folks, I do consider them &#8216;innocent until proven guilty.&rsquo;  In other words, if I were to meet you, I&rsquo;d treat you well unless you proved yourself to be another of the bad apples.  I may even count you among my friends.  Rare, but a possibility.  I think they call that &#8216;hopeful cynicism.&rsquo;  </p>

		<p>To anonymous black person, congratulations on being a black white person. Your solution to the black problem would be to force them to get married and act white and go to all white churches. So we would have to spread them out all over the country so that they acount for .01% of the population of each community. Basically segregate blacks from other blacks so that they don&rsquo;t imitate their negative behavior and emulate whites.</p>

		<p>After reading this story I would suggest you try a different line of work. Maybe McDonalds?<br>
You are not cut out for the profession you have chosen.</p>
<p>Now my next question is:<br>
What was really in that purse, I think she hadsome special goodies in there myself?</p>

<p>The sad truth is the majority of people of African decent take far more from the government than they give and are more likely to commit crime than any other race. Of course, there are exceptions. I am also a &#8220;person of color&#8221; (from India) who admires and respects whites. I wish I was white. <br>
I want to start a club for people of color who are pro-white. I want to be an honorary white. I wish I was white. Whites are beautiful, brave, and brilliant.</p>

<p>I thought the same thing when I heard he got life BUT the truth of the matter was after the punk was down the pharmacist went and got a second gun and shot the punk 5 more times in the chest.<br>
This is not self defense, it is rage at that point.<br>
Never forget if you must shoot someone for your own protection it should always be as they teach our Brave Seals, bang, bang.</p>

<p>I have know a number of great Blacks, who were honest, had the &#8220;Protestant work ethic&#8221;, etc.  There are it seems, unfortunately, quite a number of Blacks who lack these qualities.  I think it is partly due to broken families and absent fathers.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to live in a society where a woman can not walk the streets alone.  Yet that is more and more what we are devolving too.</p>
<p>A number of years back I saw an interview with abn Afghani man about what he hoped the overthrow of the Taliban would accomplish.  He hoped that with a sane government:</p>
<p>1) He would be able to support his family as a truck driver (his occupation);<br>
2) That his children would be able to attend school; and<br>
3) That his wife would be able to go to market ON HER OWN!</p>
<p>What that poor man hoped for we are throwing away by allowing OUR country to be run and over run by our social and evolutionary inferiors.<br>

		<p>Thank you guys for the positive feedback. There arent many &#8220;oreos&#8221; out there like me. When I see a colored person I assume he must act black and am surprised when he doesn&rsquo;t. I feel for whites who are mistreated by other blacks. <br>

<p>The world has changed since the days of chivalry.  Everyone should be prepared to defend him or HERself with deadly force from ruthless non-whites who think nothing of raping/assaulting/killing our beautiful women and children.</p>
<p>All women should be made aware of the danger they face in the NWO especially from violent blacks and browns   &mdash;   male AND female.  Women should be armed and ready at all times because the threat of violence is ever present and getting worse as the economy continues to deteriorate.  Get a gun.  Learn to use it.  Practice until handling it becomes second nature to the point where if you need to use it, you won&rsquo;t have to think twice about how it works.</p>
<p>It may save your life and if we arm ourselves, maybe blow away a few of our black/brown attackers, they&rsquo;ll get a strong message that we aren&rsquo;t helpless and find something else to prey on besides whites.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know me, but take it on good authority. In a life death or any serious encounter act to neutralize. Don&rsquo;t target the &#8220;face&#8221;. Target key zones: temples, top of head, bridge of nose; all around neck and throat, nape, eyes, chin and jaw line. This should give one a general idea of what I mean by key zones and to find other key zones on the agressor. Of course make height adjustments as necessary. Nothing mysterious, or secret martial techniques, just simple science of physiology.</p>

<p>When I was a youngster living in segregated Richmond, Va., an unknown black coming into our neighborhood would have been odd, and they would have been watched. As a consequence of that and other factors, there was no black on white crime.</p>
<p>Today, if you and other nice blacks are my neighbors in my mostly white neighborhood here in Berkeley, Ca., you provide cover for other blacks to wander in who are not so nice.</p>
<p>If you can figure out some way to separate ones like you from the others, and maintain that separation (I don&rsquo;t believe it can be done), I might have no objection to your living among us.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I&rsquo;d prefer you not have access to our womenfolk, since we are already decreasing in numbers.</p>
<p>Sorry, forget it.</p>

Don&rsquo;t be getting your hopes up re. &#8220;failed&#8221; reelection bid. These people will pull a rabbit out of the hat at some point. There will be an occurrence that will suddenly swing the vacillating voters over to Obama. <br>
Don&rsquo;t sell Obama&rsquo;s puppeteers short.<br>
We need a candidate who is as race conscious about White people as are Obama and his handlers about Blacks and he&rsquo;ll have to show his colors during the campaign.</p>

		<p>Lindsay O&rsquo;Brien is very lucky that all he wanted was her purse and not to rape her as well. It seems she was in a deserted area, and if he were fueled by hormones as well as greed, she might not have been so lucky as to have suffered only a broken wrist.</p>
