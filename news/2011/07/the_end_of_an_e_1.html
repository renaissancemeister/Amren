			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Freeman, Telegraph (London), June 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Driving through land his family have tended for half a century, Colin Cloete stops to inspect a harvested tobacco field, rows of green stumps sprouting from a terracotta soil.</p>
<p>As a seasoned professional farmer, he knows the field needs to be reploughed before pests infest the weedy growths left behind. As a tired political campaigner, however, he knows it is no longer worth his while.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be replanting these fields now, but I don&rsquo;t know who is going to benefit from the next harvest,&#8221; he says, shaking his head. &#8220;I will probably do it anyway, but I do wonder whether it&rsquo;s worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After an 11-year struggle in which their ranks have been murdered, beaten, jailed and bankrupted, the last of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s white farmers are finally facing defeat in their efforts to resist President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s land-grab programme.</p>
<p>Despite the introduction of a power-sharing government two years ago, state-backed farm seizures have continued, and earlier this month, Mr Cloete lost a final appeal at Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Supreme Court to keep his one remaining property.</p>
<p>Next Monday, he will appear before a local magistrate to answer a charge of trespass, for which the only way to avoid jail will be to pack up and start looking for a new house in Harare, an hour&rsquo;s drive away.</p>
<p>With his departure will also go the hopes of some 300 other white farmers  &mdash;  all that remains of a community that was once 4,000 strong  &mdash;  for whom similar legal challenges had offered some last chance of protection, or at least a stay of execution.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will probably give me about 24 hours to get off my land, as they will say I have dragged things out through the appeal process already,&#8221; sighed Mr Cloete, whose fields supply British American Tobacco, makers of Dunhill&rsquo;s and Benson and Hedges.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest, I don&rsquo;t really fancy the idea of moving to Harare, and the idea of giving up farming is heart-rending. If I was going to serve a couple of years in jail and then get the farm back, it might be worth it, but that&rsquo;s not how it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>A former head of the Commercial Farmers&rsquo; Union, Mr Cloete has spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal bills fighting the land reform programme, which put Zimbabwe on the path to economic ruin a decade ago when black squatters were first encouraged to &#8220;invade&#8221; white-owned farms.</p>
<p>Purportedly to redress the injustices of white colonial rule, its effect has been largely to create a new landlord class: the pick of white-owned land has gone to Zanu-PF cronies, leaving an agricultural sector that was once the pride of Africa in the hands of people with no experience of farming.</p>
<p>Hopes that Morgan Tsvangirai&rsquo;s MDC might use their presence in government to halt the programme have proved premature, with the party fearing that vocal support for farmers could allow Mr Mugabe to portray them as the stooges of British rule.</p>
<p>However, the prospect that the MDC might still curb the programme should they win the next elections has encouraged Zanu-PF supporters to continue to grab the remaining white-owned farms while there is still a chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan knows that the land issue is too sensitive to broach because everything is tied in with the liberation struggle,&#8221; said Mr Cloete, who lives on the farm with his wife Charmian, 57. &#8220;But do hope that at some point, we will get a new government and there will be a change of stance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Cloete&rsquo;s central claim to the Supreme Court was simple: he argued that as had bought the farm after independence in 1980, it could hardly have been considered the booty of a white colonial overlord, and therefore should be exempt from land-grab laws.</p>
<p>That the judges rejected it, though, came as no great surprise to him or his Harare-based lawyer, David Drury.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe&rsquo;s courts are dominated by Zanu-PF judges who are often beneficiaries of land-grabs themselves, says Mr Drury, while the few judges who find in favour of white claimants often end up losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Drury, though, says the intention was not to triumph against odds that were always stacked against them, but to stage what he calls a &#8220;show trial&#8221;  &mdash;  a record of events that some post-Mugabe government may use to help rectify matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a chance to provide a record of the injustice, in the hope that some sort of sanity will eventually be restored to cloud cuckoo land,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the first to support genuine land reform, and to support people who have been marginalised to become productive. But handing land to people on the basis of party connections is completely illogical.&#8221;</p>
<p>In similar fashion, the Zimbabwean government has also chosen to ignore what should have been a legally binding 2008 ruling by a tribunal of the 15-nation Southern African Development Community, made in response to a petition by 77 white farmers, that the land reform programme was inherently racist as it operated purely on the grounds of colour.</p>
<p>Legal challenges by a few other white farmers are due to be heard by the Supreme Court in July  &mdash;  with some claiming, for example, that they hold their land as a company rather than an individual  &mdash;  but the way every other case has so far been struck down means lawyers are already advising them to prepare to leave.</p>
<p>Even farmers who thought they were on solid legal ground have had no protection.</p>
<p>South African Dirk Visagie, another Chegutu farmer, has suffered constant harassment from farm invaders intent on grabbing his land, despite it supposedly being protected under a bilateral investment agreement between Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p>
<p>Mr Cloete, whose parents first came to Chegutu in 1955 and still live nearby, is in many ways typical of the white farmer&rsquo;s dwindling breed.</p>
<p>He wears the standard attire of khaki shorts and bush shirt, follows cricket keenly, and contrary to Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s narrative of white farmers as uncaring feudalists, shows a country squire&rsquo;s concern for the welfare of his black farm workers.</p>
<p>His mother, he says, built the 700-pupil local school, his father sat on the local council, and whenever his black neighbours need helping out  &mdash;  be it a fellow farmer borrowing a tractor, or the local police borrowing fuel for their cars  &mdash;  it is his door on which they knock.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a perception that we had an elitist, privileged lifestyle, and just took advantage of our workers,&#8221; he admits.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yes, I agree that there are some difficult farmers about  &mdash;  I learned that while dealing with them as head of the CFU. But there is never any talk about the schools we built, the clinics we built. We have never tried to live in isolation from the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has already handed over another farm he owns to a group of black settlers who turned up in 2006, since when, he says, he has done his best to be neighbourly.</p>
<p>He helps prepare the land for cultivation and offers advice when they need it, although driving through his estate, it is clear that some of what is now in black hands is being used for little more than subsistence agriculture.</p>
<p>Such goodwill, however, counts for little when groups of club-wielding &#8220;war veterans&#8221;  &mdash;  ostensibly men who fought in Zimbabwe&rsquo;s war for independence, but in practice often just hired thugs  &mdash;  turn up to demand a farmer&rsquo;s departure, as they last did with Mr Cloete in late 2009.</p>
<p>The men, who he suspects were sent by Colonel Norman Kapanga, the retired policeman who has claimed his second, 450-acre farm, wielded clubs and lit a fire in his front garden, although they eventually left without further confrontation.</p>
<p>What stung more, though, were the &#8220;Go back to Britain&#8221; slogans they shouted  &mdash;  meaningless to a man who is in fact of French Huguenot stock, has only ever held a Zimbabwean passport, and has nowhere else to go even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Infuriatingly, the view that he has no longer a citizen of his own country is shared by the black prosecutor who will oversee his trespass case next week, who has described him in previous court appearances as merely a &#8220;visitor&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never viewed myself as anything other than Zimbabwean, and that is what hurts me most,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not being looked at as citizens of this country, yet my father was born here before Robert Mugabe. What future do we have when you are fighting people of that mentality?&#8221;</p>

		<p>High IQ = integrity, persistence, loyalty, hard working, intelligent as shown by Colin Cloete.  But his main fault, denial of a hopeless situation.  He is lucky, his is still alive, and not disable by a beating(s), etc.  The blacks do not care if they live in a hell hole. Most of them are hopeless.</p>

IAN SMITH DIES: BBC NEWS (2 min, 21 sec. video summary)<br/>
&ldquo;Ian Smith dies aged 88,&rdquo; November 20, 2007<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2e2wftc" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2e2wftc</a></p>
<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p>BBC: &ldquo;Ian Smith believed Africans could never run their own countries. He went to his grave convinced he was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 1960s, Ian Smith, as Rhodesia&rsquo;s prime minister, defied the winds of change bringing independence and black rule to Britain&rsquo;s colonies. White Rhodesians wanted independence from Britain but without handing power to the black majority. This was unacceptable in Britain. Harold Wilson&rsquo;s Labour government was plunged into its first real crisis …Talks went nowhere. Ian Smith rebelled and in November, 1965, he made his unilateral Declaration of Independence … The British [eventually] dismissed Smith and his cabinet, but the [now] illegal regime carried on and didn&rsquo;t seem to care much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SMITH: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in black majority rule EVER in Rhodesia, not in a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BBC: &ldquo;It was black-armed opposition which eventually forced change … Robert Mugabe emerged as the new leader. But now, 27 years after independence, President Mugabe has reduced Zimbabwe to ruin, its agricultural riches destroyed, food in desperately short supply, with hyper-inflation running out of control and any and all political opposition met by violence and repression. Ian Smith felt vindicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SMITH: &ldquo;Standard of education and health and housing for our black people of any other country in the African continent. That was what Rhodesians did, and I wonder if we shouldn&rsquo;t be given credit for doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BBC: &ldquo;But the world did not tolerate Ian Smith&rsquo;s rebellion to prevent black majority rule. He lived his life out of step with the times…&rdquo; </p>
<p>Out of some 6,000 large white-owned commercial farms in 2000, less than 300 remain, with half of those facing eviction orders, 80 seized in the year since a unity government was brokered between Zanu-PF and the Movement for Democratic Change. That indicates very little has actually changed, even with MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai installed as prime minister.</p>
<p>Notice the local &ldquo;starving&rdquo; population, the population living on 2 dollars a day, the population that depends completely on the outside help of an international group made up mostly of white people - do nothing to stop the attacks on white farmers that have left their country in ruins. Amazing, isn&rsquo;t it? Everyone knows there is a direct correlation between the prosperity of that country and the number of white owned farms yet the local population which could rise up in revolt does nothing - because they&rsquo;d rather be starving and poor on their own than be normal and have to thank white people - that is how deep their racism runs.</p>
<p>This is what you get when idiot white liberals and leftist media clowns push an agenda which suddenly shifts power to blacks for no good reason.</p>
<p>Seriously, Zimbabwe is so far gone it&rsquo;s never coming back no matter who is in charge. The reason the nation is starving is obvious - the low IQ masses attacked and destroyed the white farmers for basically being white and productive without stopping to think what exactly would happen if the farms shut down. In ten years, according to the article, 95% of the country&rsquo;s white farms disappeared.</p>
<p>For black Africa as a whole, and not just Zimbabwe, the party will really be over when the last whites leave (before they are killed) and the international aid dries up thanks to the worldwide recession. Mass starvation in third-world African countries filled with violent, impulsive populations having an average IQ of 70 is not a recipe for progress.</p>
<p>This story has been played out again and again and again over the decades, even over the centuries. How much more proof of a dangerous genetic difference does any sane person need? The forced mixing of Africans into civilized white cultures that incredibly encourage and pay for this &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; is the true threat to the planet. Until whites summon the courage to face this reality - and take the necessary action - we are doomed.</p>
<p>IMF and World Bank are just fronts for Elite investment groups (like the one which threw some weight to maintain a presence via that German farm) and they are holding things together for just one reason: when things get really bad, probably starting with a white massacre and then running down through the ranks of the society as a whole, they can go in _with troops and guns_.</p>
<p>And lay waste before starting over.</p>
<p>There is a vanishing small number of wealth generation opportunities in the West. Collapsing countries represent one of them as these so-called multinationals get to effectively create a nation from nothing with ZERO oversight because THEY ARE &lsquo;the UN&rsquo;. Imagine what that must be like: roads, power, water, medical, housing. Anything that can make money.</p>
<p>And these groups operate so far behind the line of reported news that the only way you ever catch them is in the manner by which their nationalist mercenary forces are criticized for their &lsquo;brutality&rsquo; in occupying &lsquo;innocent&rsquo; lands. Just like Iraq.</p>
<p>And just like Iraq, if you **don&rsquo;t** go in with intent to recreate a corporate order (which is why the whites have to go, permanently, so that there is no record of prior ownership) that supercedes the nominal sponsoring State/s; someone else will (French ELFI oil production rights in the Majnoon fields for instance).</p>
<p>If Rhodesia wants an out, they need to start by acknowledging that their drouts are not just going to &lsquo;go away in time&rsquo; and so will require a long and very expensive desalinization/pumping system to be set up in eastern neighboring Mozambique with the water brought inland at least 250nm and held in large reservoirs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to take some serious money and that&rsquo;s going to mean China if not the West. China is exactly the kind of country which would cut in line on the Mugabe &lsquo;wait for death&rsquo; scenario, dealing with Mugabe as the sole despot in charge and then nominating his successor rather than allow hundreds of &lsquo;like minds&rsquo; begin a genocidal campaign to test each other&rsquo;s strengths.</p>
<p>As will otherwise arise in the aftermath of the Zanu-PF.</p>
<p>In trade for a continuing payout to X to basically do whatever he wanted with, the Chinese would expect &lsquo;enclave&rsquo; hegemony over entire regions of the country and would drive out and exclude those areas from African participation, which they know better than to trust. They might even bring the white farmers back, though it would be as managers not be as owners.</p>
<p>And the West would say nothing, as they already do about many of China&rsquo;s African holdings, because it is embarrassing to be beaten at your own game of robber baron capitalism (I&rsquo;m convinced that overweaning &lsquo;human rights&rsquo; politics is about 90% of the reason why America&rsquo;s elites are actually sabotaging this country as well…).</p>
<p>This is the reality of Zimbabwe right now. A land waiting for an excuse to be overrun so that companies that owe allegiance to no one can &lsquo;save&rsquo; it. For themselves.</p>
<p>Humanitarian, no?</p>

		<p>If it where up to me I would grant asylum to these white farmers and give them land in the US to farm. Then never and I mean NEVER provide any aid to Africa. They want the farms fine, use them to feed your own people, but farms don&rsquo;t just magically produce crops, somehow I don&rsquo;t think they know that. This is typical the world over, replace whites with blacks on farms and businesses and they just sit there expecting things to run by themself with no work while they collect all the rewards. The more I hear about Africa the more I hate Bob Geldof, U2 and any other liberal in pop culture who tried to brain-wash me in the 80&rsquo;s!</p>

		<p> Race is EVERYTHING to Blacks, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the whole nation starves, millions die and they&rsquo;re reduced to begging, as long as they get Whites out.<br/>
 Take this is a lesson, America.</p>
<p> Those farmers should have seen the signs from the start and quit while the going was still good. Even my boss at work said that when the violent evictions began, those farmers should have burned their crops, their machinery, their homes, then walked away, instead of just waiting for the violence to come to them.</p>

		<p>What I am amazed at is that this man Colin still doesnt realize <br/>
what he is up against.  He has spent thousands in legal courts?<br/>
He hopes to do a jail sentence and then return? He thinks things<br/>
will get better with a different set of blacks? <br/>
What part of &#8220;race&#8221; doesnt he understand yet? The issue here<br/>
isnt laws, or regimes, or appeasement, or misunderstanding.<br/>
ITS GENETICS. Blacks are coded to function in this way. </p>
<p>When their nature is curbed by some outside force  they<br/>
behave differently. But notice that that force has to be relentless, constant policing, constant jailing, constant<br/>
surveillance. Once white mans laws are gone..the real brutality<br/>
begins. </p>

<p>I live in the ghetto in Brookly and I always see blacks wearing pins and t-shirts praising Zimbabwe and Mugabe. Blacks would kill a white farmer even if they knew it would lead to 10,000 blacks starving to death. </p>
<p>Members of the ANC in South Africa openly talk of following his model of land reform despite the fact that Zimbabewe has lost like a third of its population to starvation and mass exodus following the land &#8220;reform&#8221; in Zimbabwe.</p>

It&rsquo;s just a matter of money to the white one- world elite. To take a drop of pressure off in AFREAKA, they&rsquo;ll dump the blacks on US!<br/>
Then, piecemeal, or en masse, white soldiers will go into africa, and spill their blood to secure economic interests for said one world whites. Really sick, isn&rsquo;t it?<br/>
But that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been doing for a century. <br/>

<p>No, American White people, European White people, Australian White people, you&rsquo;ll not do anything.  You&rsquo;ll do the same as these White people.  Look here!  Read!  See what awaits you and yours.  Me?  I&rsquo;m old.  I won&rsquo;t see it happen.  I&rsquo;m glad I won&rsquo;t see it happen.<br/>

		<p>@ #6 Fred:  It&rsquo;s not leftism.  Nobody knows better than your average Southern African farmer the nature of African peasants. They have no illusions of equality, and neither do the Africans, who regard the White boss as their father. The farmers generally play their feudal role, and it works to the benefit of all involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all over for Africa now. The silver lining is that most of the people who will starve will be the ones who asked for this. That and the fact that many of those farms were growing tobacco - no loss anyway.</p>

		<p>Very few people realize that this desperate scrabble for land, not only in Rhodesia but in most of Africa has one major driving factor, the absolute explosion of the African population. Possibly because this is also the period that white rule left Africa, from 1950 to 2000 the population of Africa quadrupled. To put it into context, had the same happened in the US the population of America would now be 600 million. What is happening in Rhodesia is also happening unofficially in South Africa but there too the population is exploding and it can only get worse.</p>
<p>Places like Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia also have civil unrest but these countries are front and centre with the begging bowl  pushing the white guilt to the limit, the starving children parade is out in full force and aid is flowing into the countries like water. The end result of this generosity is breathtaking. Here are the figures - in millions - of the respective populations between 2000 and 2011. Kenya 30-41. Uganda 23-34. Ethiopia 65-90. Now compare that to Rhodesia where the whole world knows this mess is nothing but black misrule and is very reluctant to loose the purse strings. 2000 Population 12.6 million. 2011 Population 12 million. And that despite the fact that the #1 country in the world for population growth - 4.3% is none other than Zimbabwe. Of course it is at the bottom of the list when it comes to life expectancy, Afghanistan is still lower but not by much.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should be grateful to Mugabe, he is showing the world what black misrule is capable of and if the point is hammered home often enough it might just sink in a bit. He has managed to create the one and only country in Africa where its population growth fall below the UN projections, the one and only country where a future good government would be able to feed all of its population. This will never happen in Uganda where its 2050 population is expected to be 103 million or Ethiopia with 170 million. Kenya has already fallen off the radar, it started off slightly higher than Uganda, had the same growth but for some reason they projected a 2050 population of 43 million which they will reach in 2013/4. Assuming the same growth as Uganda it will be about 120 million in 2050.</p>
<p>The problem is not so much that feeding these billion will be an incredible strain on the resources of the productive members of the civilized world. As is only too evident today the problem is that having made their own countries unlivable these ravaging hordes will - as many have already done - invade ours . It has been seen in the West that once they arrive our superior health and welfare systems will bring their life expectancy to our levels. Then the population boom will take off in high gear.<br/>

		<p>The Chinese will pay off the corrupt party officials to create there own plantations.  They will fence them in and make there own security arrangements.  They will continue to allow the guilty Western White do gooders feed the natives, as why should they spend the effort when they have gullible White liberals to do it for them.  However with the decline of the West, it will soon no longer be acceptable to feed other nations first when we ourselves start to starve.  When that time comes we will see an internal African genocide that will make Rwanda and the holocaust seem minor in comparison. </p>

&#8220;Mass starvation in third-world African countries filled with violent, impulsive populations having an average IQ of 70 is not a recipe for progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is perhaps mother nature at work? Due to a variety of circumstances, the population will tank, most the Africans either dying or moving away, the numbers of folks left in what used to be Rhodesia at a more acceptable level, the land eventually recovering over the many centuries, again a habitable place so unlike what it is now.<br/>

		<p>For the past week, we, in the UK, have been bombarded by continuous appeals to give money to help this years horde of starving Africans. The aid agencies say they need money to buy food locally with which to feed the natives. If all they need is money and food is available to buy, then Africans should simply give out the food to their starving brothers and sisters.  African leaders are totally silent about starving Africans and I doubt if any has even met one or visited a refugee camp. Blatter (FIFA) being investigated for fraud and vote rigging in international soccer circles, met with Mugabe last week and exchanged hugs and shared several jokes. Vote rigging and corruption is not new to either of them but Mugabe says nothing at all publicly about starving African kids with flies crawling around their eyes and mouths although such images are shown hourly on UK TV news programmes. Africa starves but throws out the only farmers capable of feeding them. There are &#8216;civil&rsquo; wars everywhere, no doubt funded by misappropriated aid money. There is no need to build a fence around Africa, it is surrounded mostly by sea and desert. True the Chinese are exploiting Africa and do not &#8216;get involved in local politics&rsquo; which means they simply ignore petty corruption and deal only with the top African leaders. Eventually the mineral mines and ivory will be exhausted but the Africans will have no need to expel the Chinese as they will simply have left long before the shiggy hits the fan. White farmers should leave Zimbabwe and leave a trail of unserviced equipment and irrigation systems. Anyway, these will decay rapidly under the African system of maintenance so harm done in the long term. There are plenty of women to walk miles to the nearest polluted stream to carry water in buckets on their heads as they have done for years. The men don&rsquo;t do this as they consider carrying water to be woman&rsquo;s work, along with everything else that needs doing. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to borrow some of Skip&rsquo;s psychic abilities, and predict that black African whining about Chinese occupation will be virtually or literally zero.  The reason is is that they know their whining will get them nowhere, because the Chinese aren&rsquo;t some gullible egalitarian white people.  In fact, as the Chinese become more oppressive in their occupation, the black African complaining <i>about whites</i> will grow louder.  They&rsquo;ll find some way to blame Chinese cruelty on whites, and the Chinese overlords will be more than happy to hear that, and in fact, will probably push that snow ball down the mountain, because it distracts from them, and because the white world is their economic rival.</p>

		<p>The simple truth is that black Africans have no history of creation or invention, excepting squalor and destruction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never had a written language, never built anything but the thatched hut, never advanced beyond the spear in weapons technology.  Their main &#8220;achievement&#8221; is their universal penchant for destruction, which they&rsquo;ve demonstrated every place on earth where they&rsquo;re found in significant numbers.</p>
<p>The Founders never in their wildest fantasies ever dreamed that blacks would be granted citizenship and equal rights with whites.  Even Abe Lincoln had no illusions about their ability to live among us peaceably and productively. He intended to relocate them either back to Africa or to the Caribbean and Central America, the latter initiative being met with threats of armed conflict by the outraged inhabitants of these areas. </p>

THE NON STARVING ETHIOPIANS sold about $40million food the the UN to feed THE STARVING ETHIOPIANS. Even better than that, the NON STARVING PAKISTANIS are listed as the UN&rsquo;s BIGGEST suppliers of food, over $200 a year for the last few years. According to their latest report, drought, floods, earthquakes and famines plus of course the obligatory wars have increased their needs blah blah blah blah, they need $550 million for the STARVING PAKISTANIS for this year. </p>

		<p>I was in Rhodesia (briefly) when it was still a country. The place functioned, this despite sanctions and a guerrilla war. </p>
<p>But then again, it was run by Whites, with an able assist from blacks who believed that working alongside Whites would be the best thing possible. Alas, the Western world was not happy until the Whites were pushed out, and a black African marxist regime was installed, and the reasonable blacks pushed aside (or massacred). And  we see the inevitable result: the usual starvation, human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing which goes hand in glove with marxism and African majority rule. </p>
<p>Yet it seems that Western elites do not draw the obvious lesson:  that it has been their own insane policies which have led to this debacle. What is even more incredible is that those polices are being continued today in the form of dumping more Western aid into Africa, into opening up Europe to mass third world migration, in the surrender of power to the multicult. The whole thing takes on the form of a demented children&rsquo;s crusade, with Bono providing the theme music. </p>
<p>Looks like we are headed for another Dark Ages. </p>

<p>The original Dark Ages were termed that because until recently, not enough was known about them and the drawn out period of the collapse of Roman centralism had yet to be replaced with strong local rule that cooperated with a less superstitious Church than earlier.  It had adjusted to the idea that the world was not ending immediately.</p>
<p>The Dark Ages you refer two will be a real one in more ways than one.  The evolutionary cycle will have to start over, once the world human population resets at a far lower level than it is now.  The decline will not be simply through miscegenation, but civil and municipal breakdown, pandemics of disease, unprecedented civil violence everywhere, and power struggles among the ambitious as the whole event unfolds.  Once the bottom is reached, which would be when there are few enough people for sustaining local, cooperative communities again, the climb out of Darkness may be longer, due to the lack of natural resources that had previously assisted the earlier rise.  The future may be nothing more than the subsistence society, vulnerable to fear, superstition, and all the things that accompanies the tenuous life.</p>
