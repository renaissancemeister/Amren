			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martin Evans, Telegraph (London), July 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The 29-year-old British Bangladeshi indicated that she felt no sympathy for the three teenagers, who died in a bus crash in the early hours of Tuesday morning, because they were middle class.</p>
<p>Describing their travels as a &#8220;gap yaar&#8221;, Miss Abdullah even said she smiled when she heard the news because two of the young men killed had double barrelled names.</p>
<p>Her comments immediately sparked widespread revulsion on the social networking site, with hundreds of people describing her as &#8220;sick&#8221; and &#8220;disgusting&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bruno Melling-Firth, Conrad Quashie and Max Boomgaarden-Cook, died instantly when the coach they were travelling in to the north of Thailand was involved in a collision with another bus.</p>
<p>Mr Boomgaarden-Cook&rsquo;s father, described his agony at the loss of his son, saying: &#8220;I did not know human bodies could produce so many tears. It is such intense pain that it will never go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just hours after the news of the tragedy was reported, Miss Abdullah, who recently published a controversial book about paedophilia, took to her Twitter page to mock their deaths.</p>
<p>She wrote: &#8220;Is it really awful that I don&rsquo;t feel sympathy for anyone killed on a gap yaar? That&rsquo;s awful, right? Yes, I&rsquo;m a terrible person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moments later she wrote: &#8220;I actually smiled when I saw that they had double-barrelled surnames. Sociopathic?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was forced to post an apology an hour later after other Twitter users flooded her page with comments condemning her.</p>
<p>One wrote: &#8220;You really are the sickest person I have come across in a long time, I hope you get no work for the rest of your miserable life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another wrote: &#8220;You are not sorry; you were just caught out. If you were sorry you wouldn&rsquo;t have Tweeted TWICE on the subject. You are vile.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Miss Abdullah said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m very sorry about my thoughtless comments on Twitter this morning. I know how it feels to lose a loved one and can understand why people felt sickened by what I said. I apologise to everyone I offended, in particular the families involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Abdullah was born in Tower Hamlets in east London and was educated at Queen Mary University.</p>
<p>She has published two controversial novels, Life Love and Assimilation and Child&rsquo;s Play, which drew condemnation from her native British Bangladeshi community.</p>
<p>She also contributes regularly to The Guardian.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the newspaper said: &#8220;Kia Abdullah is an occasional freelance contributor to the Guardian&rsquo;s Comment is Free website.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has never been on contract, is not on the staff of the Guardian and has not written for any part of the Guardian since May 2010. The Guardian is not responsible for what occasional contributors write on Twitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet, out geovenments are at this very moment are not only importing millions of similar foreigners into our homelands, but forcing us to pay for their upkeep.  What will life be like for your children, when these people are the vast majority in England or the USA or Canada, and when they control the governemnt, police, courts, social services and everything else?  Will your grandchildren get a fair shake from people who &#8220;smile&#8221; when they read about the deaths of our children?  Time is running out!  </p>

Does anyone doubt, for a moment that if a  white person was overjoyed at the &#8216;death of surnames i can&rsquo;t pronounce&rsquo; they would be up before the kommisars on &#8216;hate thought&rsquo; charges.</p>
<p>Will she still work at the Guardian, yep. Will she face any charges (and for the record i don&rsquo;t think she should, but i object tohow they are asymmetrically applied)? No.</p>
<p>and finally, why was she let into the UK in the first place?</p>

<p>Gap year- a year of traveling between college and a career or high school and career. </p>
<p>Companies in the UK are flexible about allowing new hires a year off to travel.</p>
<p>Double barreled - Ambrose Evans-Pritchard would be an example - unlike the US, where it reflects baby boomer feminism (I am NOT taking my partner&rsquo;s last name) in the UK its usually an ode to a powerful or worthy surname of the maternal line</p>

		<p>A gap year is when middle class brits go traveling around the world (usually to volunteer at some third world NGO) for a year in between high school and college. It&rsquo;s funny she would insult them because the type of people who take gap years are pretty much the readership of the Guardian.</p>

		<p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>Double barrelled names are seen as more upper-middle class here and a gap year is a year out between finishing high school and starting university which may involve travelling or even just working up money for university! </p>
<p>However I don&rsquo;t believe the boys families having enough money to pay for their travelling or that two of the boys had double barrelled names is the reason their deaths brought a &#8220;smile&#8221; to her disgusting face&hellip; </p>
<p>I suspect if 3 upper class minority boys died in a similar way she would have had nothing to write but condolences.</p>

		<p>The use of &#8220;gap yaar&#8221; is a reference to the popular british pastime of taking a year travelling abroad before commencing university. Due to the costs involved the people involved usually rely on financial support from wealthy parents. These tourists do have a reputation for drunken behaviour whilst abroad, enter &#8220;gap yah&#8221; into youtube to see a parody from last year.</p>
<p>Double-barrelled names are typically from the wealthy classes in the UK.</p>

		<p>A &#8220;gap year&#8221; is a year spent in travel by a young person after leaving school but before university. A &#8220;double-barrelled name&#8221; is a hyphenated name, as in the two quoted, viz., Melling-Firth and Boomgaarden-Cook. Both signify membership in the at least the middle class (in the British sense - i.e., above the working class). Kia Abdullah&rsquo;s comment probably reflects the old-fashioned class antagonism long cultivated by the British left as much as, or more than, it does an ethnic antipathy.</p>
<p>Traditionally a family adopted a double-barrelled name when a man married an heraldic heiress, i.e., a daughter of an armiger who had no son to carry on his family name. Thus, when plain Mr. X marries Miss Y, the only daughter of Squire Y, he may change his name by deed poll to X-Y and carry the heiress&rsquo;s arms in an escutcheon of pretense on his own. The children will have the surname X-Y and will bear quarterly the arms of X first and fourth, and the arms of Y second and third. These in turn descend, with suitable marks of cadency, to their offspring. If the lady should be the heiress to a peerage or baronetcy that can descend through a female, her eldest son will inherit it as well as the quartered arms. There are also more complicated ways in which a double-barrelled name may originate, as in the example of the family of the dukes of Roxburghe, named Innes-Ker.</p>
<p>A great many  modern double-barrelled names are merely middle-class combinations of the husband&rsquo;s surname and his wife&rsquo;s without any of these underlying reasons, aping a practice that originated amongst the nobility and gentry as outlined. To identify a &#8220;real&#8221; aristocratic double-barrelled name, and to distinguish it from these latter-day imitations, requires either a personal acquaintance with the families&rsquo; genealogy, or use of a reference like Debrett or Burke&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Gap year&rsquo; is either the year after they have left secondary school or the year after they finish university to pursue interests which are not academic.  More often than not they travel to somewhere exotic.</p>
<p>Double-barrelled names tend to be found in people from an upper-middle class or upper class background.  I am certain her motivation was classed-based and it is inextricably linked to the fact that it is very much a white, British, indigenous phenomenon.  </p>
<p>This woman is part of the metropolitan, multi-cultural, liberal elite that are in the process of destroying my country. But she will never be British, certainly not English, and her hatred of all things British shines through in every utterance that spews from her mouth.<br>

		<p>When she says &#8216;gap yaar&rsquo; she is talking about the &#8216;gap year&rsquo; (the &#8216;yaar&rsquo; is supposed to sound like a posh person saying &#8216;year&rsquo;) that many young people in Britain take nowadays between finishing their A levels at 18, and starting university. The most common goal is to spend a year travelling abroad. The reason she mentions double-barrelled names is that in this country they are synonymous with wealthy, middle-class types who have been to expensive private/public schools.</p>
<p>I suppose her defence against accusations of racism is that she was being &#8216;classist&rsquo; rather than racist. However, laws brought in by the Labour party some years ago mean that an incident should be defined as a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; if the victim themselves, or crucially, anyone from the victim&rsquo;s community, feels that it was a racial/homophobic incident. So in theory, seeing as I am white and English, and the victims were white and English, I should be able to insist that this crime is treated as a hate crime. However, in practice, as I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine, such laws were never intended be used to our benefit, nor will they be.</p>

		<p>Re the &#8220;double barreled&#8221; names:  A fair number of country music singers, especially pre-2000, used their full names in both their professional lives and their real lives.  Such as John Michael Montgomery, Lee Roy Parnell, David Lee Murphy.  The reason is the same, because their middle names was an allusion to the mother&rsquo;s side of the family somehow, and their parents inculcated them with all three names to keep the other side of the family happy.  Definitely the British &#8220;double barreling&#8221; tradition translated to the American South.</p>

<p>Yes! That&rsquo;s the association I make with hyphenated names. But, I knew from context that that couldn&rsquo;t possibly be Abdullah&rsquo;s problem with them.</p>

		<p>Hello all, the other posters did a great job of explaining things like &#8220;doubled-barreled surnames&#8221; and &#8220;gap yaar&#8221;. Just a minor point - &#8220;yaar&#8221; means &#8220;friend?dude?&#8221; also in Urdu/Hindu - not sure if there was a pun of some type intended when used like this.</p>
<p>I met two British young men traveling around NZ/AUS/SE Asia on their gap year when I was in Asia/Aus traveling/diving. They were friendly, well bred, intelligent and a credit to their people.</p>
<p>International travel of this type can lead to a greater understanding of non-Western cultures and well as a greater appreciation of our own Western inheritance.</p>
<p>Condolences to the families and the UK.</p>

		<p>Apparently, in her moral blindness Ms. Abdullah found it hysterically funny that these boys killed instantly in a tragic bus accident (in a third-world country no less) had hyphenated last names which signified they were white and upper-middle class.</p>
<p>If white people in a Muslim country twittered a similar statement about young Muslim men with obviously Muslim names who were killed in a tragic accident, these white people would most likely be sentenced to death under a fatwa issued by a Muslim iman for insulting pious Muslims, especially if the trip had been to Mecca (is this really any different than a &#8220;gap&#8221; year?).</p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t advocate that white people descend to such depths of hatefulness, we are far too lenient.</p>
