			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>PGA Links, July 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As golf&rsquo;s leading organization, The PGA of America is an industry leader in increasing the diversity of the game and business of golf. With more than 2,000 women and professionals of color and a strategic and tactical plan to grow future diversity, The PGA is making the game more inclusive and accessible than ever before.</p>
<p>The PGA&rsquo;s focus on diversity is evident by the inclusion of specific goals for growing the participation and employment of women and minorities in the game in its strategic and annual business plans. Providing input to The PGA is a Diversity Committee which is accountable to the PGA Board of Directors. Representatives include PGA Professionals, and industry business leaders. The committee provides counsel on diversifying The PGA membership, suppliers and other business opportunities.</p>
<p>The PGA of America&rsquo;s diversity strategy begins with the premise that in order to grow public participation among women and people of color, The PGA, its business partners and its Member Professionals must reflect the same diversity as the public they serve. Currently 14.5% of Caucasians, 13.7% of Asian Americans, 7% of African Americans, 6% of women and 5.4% of Latinos play the game. Specific programs operated by The PGA of America, as well as, alliances with other leading golf organizations including The First Tee, the Executive Women&rsquo;s Golf Association and the LPGA, are designed to address this lower participation rate among women and minorities.</p>
<p>The PGA exercises sound practices to ensure that all individuals receive fair treatment in their desire to become affiliated with the Association and the business of golf. We encourage diversity as it leads to new opportunities to help fulfill the mission of The PGA of America.</p>

		<p>Ever since Tiger&rsquo;s &#8220;leg injury&#8221; (wasn&rsquo;t it his face that his White wife smashed with a club?), golf has become increasingly safer and more pleasant to watch on TV.</p>
<p>And kudos to the White women who saved us from seeing either or both of those hideous blacks in another Wimbledon final.</p>

		<p>The premise of the third paragraph is preposterous.  If true, I would expect to see the National Basketball Association seeking to encourage more non-black players to play basketball, so that the percentage of non-blacks who play will equal the percentage of blacks who play.<br/>

<p>This is why immigration policy should be decided at arm&rsquo;s length from economic interests.  </p>

		<p>Why is it that successful organizations built by the ingenuity, hard work and skill of whites, always eventually thinks that adding a bunch of nonwhites will make the organization better?  When was the last time a bunch of whites demanded to be included into some successful black enterprise?  It is amazing, in the larger context of race consciousness, as Jared Taylor demonstrates in his new book, that whites refuse to consiously look after their own group interests while all others do so strenuously and without apology.  I&rsquo;ve personally had it with all the cowardice of whites.  My children will inherit nothing but a miscegenated mess by the time they reach their twenties.  Diversity is not a strength   &mdash;   it is a bane.</p>

		<p>I live in Johns Creek, Georgia, the site of the 2011 PGA Championship, and I can personally attest that the PGA is in full diversity mode. </p>
<p><br/>
Along my 25 mile commute to Atlanta I see no less than three billboards promoting the event. Aside from the PGA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden Child&rsquo; Tiger, all of the billboards seem to promote non-White players, specifically those of Asian descent. </p>

		<p>Who are these people kidding? This must be for public consumption because even the PGA can&rsquo;t be that ignorant.</p>
<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m missing something. Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t see the fine folks leaving their Section 8 housing at 6AM with their clubs and spiked shoes so they can tee off at 7.</p>
<p>Maybe the PGA stands for &#8220;Prison Golf Association.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here you have people who can barely afford a basketball - and you&rsquo;re promoting an expensive game of patience - with iron clubs no less - to this same group?</p>
<p>This is baloney and they know it. </p>

<p>Not true. If you have special programs and quotas for non-whites then you are not offering fair treatment to whites.</p>

		<p><i><b>must</b> reflect the same diversity</i></p>
<p>Or else&hellip;</p>
<p>Will the LPGA be forced to accept men?<br/>
Will the B(lack)PGA (when it&rsquo;s created) be forced to accept Whites?<br/>
Will the G(ay)PGA (when it&rsquo;s created) be forced to accept straights?</p>
<p>No - of course not.</p>
<p><i>professionals of color</i></p>
<p>This is sooooo old already.</p>
<p>Colored (Insert some phrase here) is so &#8216;racist&rsquo;, but (Insert some phrase here) of color is so tragically hip. That is, until the Left comes up with a new, &#8216;acceptable&rsquo; phrase and then (Insert some phrase here) of color will become &#8216;racist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>50 years of this nonsense already, with a lifespan of eternity - or until there is no more America - whichever comes LAST.</p>

		<p>If you wanna see a lack of diversity, one should watch the CURLING competitions or perhaps BOWLING! maybe even pool/billiards championships&hellip;totaly White..though I had no idea WTH curling was till I watched it a few minutes on TV once, thought they were sliding a clothes iron down a bowling lane and WTH are the two guys doing running down the lane with brooms ahead of the iron? Still though, it IS an all white &#8220;sport&#8221;?</p>

They lost their cash cow Tiger Woods who drew in all the non-whites who never cared about golf.</p>
<p>If they can keep the minority viewers interested, they can rake in the sponsorhip and advertising money.</p>

		<p>Well, as usual, when something is mostly white, there has to be special programs at work to undo that. I&rsquo;ve really noticed this mostly in the LPGA. I don&rsquo;t get into college sports, so I could be mistaken. </p>

		<p>Diversity is a code word for ethnic cleansing.  It&rsquo;s a code word for genocide.  </p>
<p>The genocidists knew they had to find a nice sounsing word for what they&rsquo;re doing so people would accept it.  What they&rsquo;re doing is committing genocide against white people.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for the day that the country club my parents belong to will be forced to admit non-whites with discounted rates and free golf clubs, because of their White privilege. On a side note my parents came from nery meager beginnings and through hard work and sacrifice they have done very well for themselves, white privilege indeed.</p>

		<p>Check out membership and green fees for your local golf courses. It will be obvious that only the rich and upper middle economic levels can easily afford to play golf. Any black golfers will be Oreos, who pose no hardship on other golfers</p>
<p>Note that the leading golf organization is not handing out thousands of diversity memberships for local country clubs to da boyz in da hood &amp; their debbies. That would be too much (ie real) diversity for the county clubbers.</p>

<p>Oh, I agree!! And what a faker!  I almost got into a fistfight with my neighbor when I predicted he would never be the same after the exposure of his secret, depraved, duplicitous life.  Pay up Dude!</p>
<p> And, from reports I read on the Internet, Tiger was NO gentleman on the fairway   &mdash;   often throwing clubs and cursing when things didn&rsquo;t quite go his way, even in the presence of children   &mdash;     as the cameras cut away so as not to &#8220;ruin&#8221; his &#8220;wholesome&#8221; reputation, LoL. Well, it all came out in the wash eventually as these things usually do.</p>
<p>Watching the new upstart, Rory McIlroy, has been a joy!  He may look like a high school kid but he is AMAZING.  </p>
<p>Yes, let there be light in the PGA again.</p>
