			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross, San Francisco Chronicle, July 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ex-convicts may soon become a &#8220;protected class&#8221; in San Francisco  &mdash;  joining African Americans, Latinos, gays, transgender people, pregnant women and the disabled.</p>
<p>A proposal being circulated at City Hall would make it illegal for landlords and employers to discriminate against applicants solely because they were &#8220;previously incarcerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sex offenders and perpetrators of some violent crimes would not be covered.</p>
<p>It would also be illegal to ask anyone about their criminal past on an initial job or housing application.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ex-cons already are a protected class when it comes to applying for a city job or seeking to live in housing run by the San Francisco Housing Authority.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Trust me - I recognize the concern,&#8221; said District Attorney and former Police Chief George Gasc√≥n, who backs the plan. &#8220;But if we want to reduce the likelihood of people going back to prison, then we have to provide them with an opportunity to reintegrate themselves.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Gascon is the current DA and the former Chief, and he&rsquo;s babbling on about &#8220;an opportunity to reintegrate themselves.&#8221;  He should be first to realize that you have to make life on the outside as tough as possible for released ex-cons, as a deterrent against future crime.</p>

		<p>A huge amount of San Francisco rental property is owned by Asians.  Lost of luck eforcing this law.  Asians won&rsquo;t rent to a black congressman or physician let alone a black on probation.</p>
<p>I have never seen a rental application that asked about criminal records.  Is this common?</p>
<p>It is good for the thousands of White attorneys infesting San Francisco though.  The can sue the landlord for not renting to a black criminal.  Then when the landlord is forced to rent to black criminals they can sue on behalf of the tenants who are raped, murdered and robbed by their fellow black tenants.</p>
<p>As totally stupid as the White male gays who are a highly visible part of the Anti White movement are all those White men who go to law school for only one reason: because of affirmative action laws they can&rsquo;t get any kind of job from engineer to dishwasher.</p>
<p>But as soon as that bar card is in their hands they start suing Whites on behalf of blacks and other minorities.</p>

		<p>San Francisco had a program such as this many decades ago.They hired drivers for the Municipal Railway bus system DIRECTLY out of San Quentin Prision!  Black Muni drivers have a well known reputation for being extremely rude to passengers, usually white ones. One SF Muni driver, was sent to prison for life for killing a 12 year old black male in Richmond. He had previously threatened to get a gun and shoot someone who had broken down in the street and blocked his path, he did this  WHILE ON DUTY.  Another one would not let a female hispanic passenger stay on the bus, she was trying to seek safety from a black who then raped and beat her severely. No action was taken against the driver.</p>

		<p>Why haven&rsquo;t SF, Boston, Austin, Minneapolis, Ann Arbor, Portland, and all these other liberal cities figured out that they&rsquo;re driving families out of their cities with these loony policies.  I know many urban professionals in these cities who moved to the suburbs as soon as they had kids   &mdash;   and not out of squalid neighborhoods either.  They knew they couldn&rsquo;t raise their children in a sea of group homes, halfway houses, and immigrant sanctuaries.  This ordinance is only going to attract felons to San Francisco and scatter them throughout the city.  It is going to alienate more people with children or planning to have children and drive them out of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Planners and policymakers in the suburbs know this.  They know that the urban exodus is not entirely due to race.  White people don&rsquo;t want to live with marginal, low-class white people any more than they want to live with blacks.  </p>

		<p>I used to enjoy the show that the African American BART bus drivers<br>
(Dublin to Hayward) put on.  The usual driver had a voice like Eddie &#8220;Rochester&#8221; Anderson and made no secret of his dislike of whites. I don&rsquo;t think he much liked blacks or anyone else for that matter&hellip;  When people would ask him if there was an emergency for his fast driving, he&rsquo;d shoot back &#8220;Yeah, its an emergency dat I keeps mah job.&#8221;  He had a fairly large Afro &amp; simply put his BART cap on top.  </p>

		<p>S.F. is an anti-matter universe. In SF, Up is Down, Left is Right, and, as Homer Simpson once said, &#8220;Hot snow falls up and hamburgers eat people.&#8221;  I know, I used to live there. Of course ex-cons are the new protected class. Is there any wonder why Califoria is broke? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Would not let her stay on the bus&#8221;-Peejay in Frisco<br>
 I had a similar experience years ago. I got on an in bound bus rather than wait for the outbound thinking it would turn around for the outbound route after reaching downtown. I was wrong and worse not paying attention. When I realized my mistake it was at the end of the route about 15 miles from where I needed to be, and most of that distance in a baaad neighborhood. So I refused to get off. The driver threatened to call the transit police. I said, &#8220;Good!! I know how to get home from jail!&#8221; He called his supervisor who said that I could ride back to the bus depot, which was a long walk but one I knew. Funny thing I always remember. The driver was a jerk trying to put me off in an area where we BOTH knew it would be dangerous for me, but on the ride back to the depot, he was practically chatty with me&hellip;</p>

		<p>The common excuse is the released convicts have served their debt to society.  Legally true, but as a practical matter the recidivism rate is very high,  &mdash;   over 70% that they will be rearrested.  BTW, the rearrest rate for murders, buglars and illegal gun and drug sales is far, far higher than that of rapists (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism).</p>
<p>Being a convict is an excellent screen for the likelihood of future illegal activity. So why force employers, or city citizens, to endure this known statistical likelihood of bad behavior?  Jobs for the needy convicts I am sure.  But why not give those jobs to needy non-convicts with better behavior records?  There is a 70% chance the ex-con are rearrested, and a near 0% chance the non-cons are arrested.  Another classic example of &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; where bad behavior and bad choices are rewarded with extraordinary previledges by the government.</p>

		<p>Notice how more &#8220;victims&#8221; and protected classes have been added to the anti-discrimination laws of 1964?  I applaud the Asians for not caving in to race hustlers and having to rent to black criminals.  If only whites had the same gumpton like we used to&hellip;</p>

		<p>Tim McHugh: Hurrah for you!  You put him in his place.  I forgot to mention that 2 days ago, I got on an SF bus, and after I put in the fare, I briefly glanced up to the driver, a very obese, not at all attractive black female, and I got the worst sinister, evil, nasty look from her that I have experienced in over a decade.</p>

		<p>Muni transit is not the only city agency that recruits out of prison.  </p>
<p>Virtually all the black male civilian employees of the San Francisco Sheriff&rsquo;s department served time in state prison.  Some are not even from California.  There is an entire crew of do nothing fools working for the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department who were recruited straight out of some Michigan prison.</p>
<p>At one time the &#8220;executive director&#8221; of civilian employees was Mike Marcum who served 7 years at Quentin for murder.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a landlord.  Rental applications don&rsquo;t ask questions about criminal convictions.  Most criminals have the lowest credit ratings possible.  Most of their incomes are too low to qualify for any kind of housing in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The landlords have no way of knowing if Garoshaque Jackson is a felon or a civil servant.  So how can they be found discriminatory if the application does not ask about a criminal history? </p>
<p>This is just another feel good cause for the lunatic left, like the  anti circumcision law proposed for the entire state of California.</p>
<p>For instance, a few years ago the looney left came up with a medical care for all program.  They just felt so good and saintly and superior when the program passed.  Every homeless and indigent person in the county got a card for free medical card.</p>
<p>BUT!!!! The card could only be used in the existing county hospital and existing county and city free clinics.</p>
<p>It did nothing to expand medical care for the indigent.  Just a different plastic card to use free facilities that have been around since San Francisco was a Mexican colony.</p>
<p>But the looney left had something to do for a while and something else to feel superior about.</p>
<p>What does a tiny 12 by 10 bachelor unit with a half size fridge and microwave cost in San Francisco these days?  $2,000 per month?</p>

		<p>&#8220;According to The City&rsquo;s Human Rights Commission, San Francisco has the highest recidivism rate of any big city in California, almost 80 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m shocked, shocked I tell you.  With all the love and adoration San Francisco lavishes on criminals, particularly black criminals I can&rsquo;t believe they continue in their criminal ways.</p>
<p>What have we White lunatic lefties done wrong that our unfortunate black brothers commit more and more crimes.  We must do more to help them.</p>
