			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Levine and Jennifer Griffin, Fox News, July 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. military serviceman has been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to attack Fort Hood nearly two years after a deadly shooting rampage at the base, Fox News has learned exclusively.</p>
<p>Pvt. Naser Jason Abdo, an AWOL soldier from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was arrested by the Killeen Police Department near Fort Hood and remains in custody there.</p>
<p>Abdo, 21, was found with weapons, explosives and jihadist materials at the time of his arrest, a senior Army source confirms to Fox News. He was arrested at around 2 p.m. Wednesday after someone called authorities to report a suspicious individual. </p>
<p>Eric Vasys, a spokesman with the FBI&rsquo;s San Antonio Office, said authorities found firearms and bomb making components inside Abdo&rsquo;s motel room. Sources also say Abdo was attempting to make a purchase at Guns Galore in Killeen, the same ammunition store where Major Nidal Hasan purchased weapons that were allegedly used to gun down 13 people and wound 30 others on Nov. 5, 2009.</p>
<p>Sources said Abdo had enough materials to make two bombs, including 18 pounds of sugar and six pounds of smokeless gunpowder  &mdash;  a possible trigger for an explosive. A pressure cooker was also found.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was all ready to go,&#8221; one law enforcement source said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bob Jenkins, a Fort Campbell spokesman, told Fox News that Abdo was also being investigated for child pornography found on his government computer.</p>
<p>Abdo went AWOL on July 4. On the eve of his first deployment to Afghanistan  &mdash;  after only one year in the Army  &mdash;  Abdo applied for conscientious objector status. It was denied by his superiors at Ft. Campbell but later overturned by the Assistant Deputy Secretary of the Army review board.</p>

		<p><i>Abdo applied for conscientious objector status.</i></p>
<p>There is no draft anymore, therefore there should be no provision for conscientious objector status.</p>
<p>This caper was bust wide open when the gun dealer reported Abdo&rsquo;s suspicious behavior.  Ironic, considering we&rsquo;re in the middle of the Fast &amp; Furious scandal.  You can bet that Obama, the left and the ATF will continue their jihad against legitimate firearms dealers, in spite of this dealer doing the right thing.  But that&rsquo;s part of the essence of doing the right thing   &mdash;   Doing it when you know there won&rsquo;t be a reward.</p>

<p>Well, then, that wraps things up, doesn&rsquo;t it?  There were <i>guns</i> involved, so it had to be the guns&rsquo; fault.  Private Naser Jason Abdo was just a victim of those guns&rsquo; hypnotic spell, that&rsquo;s all.  And anyone who draws any other conclusions is a Racist.</p>

		<p>Police departments throughout this country know that gun dealers are great sources of information which they could use to stop crime. One example I know of, the dealers told the cops that some guy bought twelve pistol holsters and no pistols. The police looked into the matter and found out the guy was a gun smuggler. Your community has examples of this.<br>
    Chicago has no gun shops, thanks to Richard Daley and the Irish mob. The local police has no dealers who could give them tips. That could explain why crime is so high. </p>

		<p>Muslims often find recreation in gluttony which includes blood letting as part of their death cult religion.<br>
Watch as a fully grown and domesticated camel is brought into a public square in the mid east and slaughtered for the crowds enjoyment. <br>
You will never view a Muslim in the same way again.<br>
The graphic footage can be found at an offbeat website called mental zero.</p>

		<p>That guy in the photo is white or heavily mixed with Euro. I think it&rsquo;s the ideology of Islam that makes them violent, not the genes. I don&rsquo;t hear about Christian or unreligious Mid-easterners blowing stuff up. </p>
<p>On the other hand a case could be made that only a low-IQ person or culture would maintain the nasty bits of their religion for centuries on end. You don&rsquo;t see Jews stoning adulterers or Sabbath-breakers like they&rsquo;re commanded to in the Old Testament.</p>

		<p>Is Naser Jason Abdo really his name? If he wanted to find a kooky religion he should have given Scientology a try.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to report Americans who are recent Islamic converts to Homeland Security, instead of wheelchair-bound diaper wearing Christian grannies. Be on the lookout for women with Muslim headgear. If you spot one call 1-800-222-TIPS.</p>

		<p>Well we&rsquo;ve permitted with sworn enemies of the United States to infiltrate our armed services quite easily . Why is no one reacting to these things? Why aren&rsquo;t we demanding answers instead of worrying about wether there&rsquo;ll be an NFL season this year? If you grant conscientious objector status to a soldier then what&rsquo;s the point of him being in the military? How can you let Muslims enlist in the military when it&rsquo;s obvious that the enemy  de jour or de siecle is Islam?  Isn&rsquo;t it apparent that they have no loyalty to anything save for their diabolical ideology disguised as a religion.<br>
Are these officials total cretins or are they clever devils?<br>
Hey you out there!!!!! This is the last great hope. If we lose this country there IS NO OTHER PLACE TO GO!!!<br>
Get off your butts and do something if not for &#8221; God&rsquo;s sake&#8221; then for your own.</p>

		<p>How many MORE Muslims are in our military?  I say keep close tabs on EVERY ONE of them, and at the slightest hint that anything is amiss, throw them in the brig or its equivalent.  No soldier should be allowed to cop a CO for being unwilling to fight other Muslims; they signed up for the military to fight enemies, and if they aren&rsquo;t willing to do that they need to be court-martialed and gotten rid of ASAP.  Before they injure and kill any more Americans.</p>

		<p>I understand that his father is Muslim and that his mother is Christian.  He grew up as a Christian and never had any real contact with Islam until he was around 17.  His interest in kiddie porn is evidence that he is very immature.  I think the best thing is for the Army to put him out and let him try to get his very confused life in order.</p>

		<p>This guy looks like your regular run-of-the-mill American White guy. It goes to show that Islam is insidious in all its nature. It&rsquo;s a pseudo-religion full of contradictions, and its most devote are the most hypocritical. Based on that assessment, I&rsquo;m surprised that the Senate &amp; House in Washington don&rsquo;t have as many converts. The double talk about not raising taxes from the GOP is flat out betrayal to the Middle class. </p>
<p>The Middle class should be admired by the elites because we act as a buffer between rioting poor (a high percentage urban minorities) &amp; gated-community dwelling fat cats on in Beverly Hills. But there&rsquo;s alot more people in the former than in the latter. And one day, the Africanization will be complete. Swarm your armed target and approach. He&rsquo;ll run out of ammo eventually. Sure the poor will have many casualties, but the ultimate prize will be in their hands because of the shear endless number of lower-income breeders there are. That is one time where I will be rooting for the minorities against the traitorous White elite class.</p>
