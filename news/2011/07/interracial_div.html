			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Razib Khan, Discover Magazine, March 6, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It has been known for years that interracial marriages have higher than expected divorce rates. But I did not know that the rates varied quite a bit contingent on the combination of race &amp; sex. Gori Girl has a post up, Interracial Divorce in the U.S.  &mdash;  Statistics and How Much They Matter:</p>
<blockquote>- Marriages that do not cross a race barrier, but do have different ethnicities (i.e. white/Hispanic white) have a rate of divorce just a little higher than white/white marriages.
<p>- Interracial marriages that have one white person and one person of another race mostly only show higher divorce rates when the white spouse is a female (i.e. white guy + other race girl don&rsquo;t show particularly high divorce rates compared to same-race couples).</p>
<p>- Black husband/white wife marriages are twice as likely to divorce as white/white marriages, and Asian husband/white wife marriages are about 60% more likely to divorce as white/white marriages. {snip}</p>
<p>- White husband/black wife were nearly 50% less likely to divorce than white/white couples, and white husband/Asian wife couples had pretty much the same divorce rate as white/white couples</p>
<p>- Compared to Hispanic/Hispanic couples, Hispanic white/white couples showed a higher likelihood of divorce (not surprising). Likewise, Asian/white couples were more likely to divorce than Asian/Asian couples. However, black/white couples only show a higher rate of divorce compared to black/black couples if the white person in the relationship is a woman.</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The higher divorce rates for white female/non-white male dyads somewhat surprised me, but perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have been. There seems a robust body of social science that white women in the United States are particularly race conscious. I stumbled onto a paper which emphasized this point, and its subtle nuances, recently. I didn&rsquo;t blog it because the sex difference in racial mating preference is such a robust finding that it doesn&rsquo;t seem noteworthy (though perhaps racialist message boards should focus a bit more on male rather than female &#8220;race traitors,&#8221; as it is the XY who are more open to sullying the purity of the volk). In any case, the paper is Gendered racial exclusion among white internet daters. Here&rsquo;s the figure which stood out to me:</p>
<p>The big finding is this: among white women who stated a racial preference on Yahoo Personals, 73%, 64% of these selected that they wished to date white men only. In contrast, among white men who stated a racial preference, 60%, only 29% of these stated that they would like to date white women only. In other words: men who expressed racial preferences were excluding particular types of women, while women who expressed racial preferences were doing so to include only men of their own race. This seems to comport with previous work which suggests that once you control for perceived physical attractiveness men do not discriminate much in dating, while women continue to discriminate even if they assess out-group males to be physically attractive (e.g., one would conclude from this that the white male aversion to dating black women has to do with assessments of physical appearance, as much of the discriminatory effect disappears once you control for assessed attractiveness). This makes some sense, men generally weight physical appearance higher than women in the calculus which determines their preferences.</p>

		<p>There is a fashionable conspiracy theory among black extremists and obsessives, especially black men, that white women are &#8220;bait&#8221; that the &#8220;white po-leece&#8221; plant in order to nab black men into jail.  Their &#8220;evidence&#8221; is that in their experience, almost every black man who has a relationship with a white woman winds up getting arrested. </p>
<p>First off, that would probably happen without the interracial relationship.  But if the arrest is a result of the relationship, my theory is that black men are more violent, domestically and otherwise, than white men, and white women are more sensitive to domestic violence, more likely to interpret such an act as an incident worthy of police attention, than black women, who interpret those particular ways of black men as a mere fact of life.  Ergo, put the two together, and the cops will almost inevitably be called.</p>

<p>Black woman (bottom of the barrel) get a (huge) step up the status ladder and a middle class life-style, white (closeted homosexual) man gets a wife - a wife, who might put up with a little more than other races&rsquo; women, who provides cover to help people from wondering if he is a homosexual.</p>

		<p>A few points:</p>
<p>Why are the people on the original article site calling preferences &#8220;discrimination&#8221;? Many people have standards, many people realize they&rsquo;ve made a mistake later on (apparently, White women the most) &amp; some don&rsquo;t learn at all. And if a man/woman isn&rsquo;t attracted to someone, that&rsquo;s not a point of dispute; you are or aren&rsquo;t. Simple as that. </p>
<p>Why are women &amp; (genuine) feminism always blamed for everything that is wrong with the world? Men have ruled &amp; oppressed for most of history. Contemporary bad social/personal behaviour comes from both sides, but men&rsquo;s laziness, lack of ambition etc cannot be blamed on women&rsquo;s relatively new rights to vote, be educated, work, be thought of as more than a servant to her husband &amp; children etc.</p>
<p>Is the White-Asian thing a result of some White men&rsquo;s inability/unwillingness to interact on an equal level with a woman, so he goes for a perceived meek woman, or is it the result of genuine attraction?</p>
<p>Why have African women always pushed it in my face that all men secretly yearn for them but hide it because they&rsquo;re afraid? Why do they always insult others to boost their egos? And why can they not understand that the ones amongst them the media deems attractive are so because they are mixed with White, Middle Eastern, Latino etc? </p>
<p>Are non-African men really not generally attracted to African women? Because they all like to point out to me the numerous examples in the media &amp; throughout history of other men having children with them &amp; hiding it, plus there&rsquo;s the Somalian &amp; Brazilian populations&hellip;</p>

		<p>While it disgusts me to see Whites having offspring with nonWhites, I must say that the Darwinism here is one of natural selection.  Ninety-nine of of a hundred times when I see a White with a nonWhite I say to myself that the Whites &#8220;family tree is more horizontal than vertical.&#8221;  These White interlopers are not smart enough to call themselves &#8220;White&#8221; by my standards.  Any &#8220;White&#8221; person that would inject their family tree with a cocoa bean is not going to realize until it is to late that the lineage passed to them has effectively reversed course.  I have seen parents of mulatto children, and the blank stares they will now go through life with all too often.  At this point, I just shake my head in amazement.</p>
<p>I figure they are more of a lineage of stupidity, and more than likely, criminality.  Even law-breaking idiots are able to breed.      </p>

		<p>&#8220;Black husband/white wife marriages are twice as likely to divorce as white/white marriages.&#8221;</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>An attractive 41-year-old white woman recently volunteered to me that after growing up poor in a sheltered rural southern community, she went to one of those large consolidated public high schools built in the 70s and 80s to promote integration.  </p>
<p>Blacks there &#8220;hit on her.&#8221; Her father having recently passed away, she had little guidance. She got involved with one and married him. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know any better.&#8221;</p>
<p>When that marriage failed after one mixed-race child, there was a second marriage (to a man of what race I don&rsquo;t know) which also failed. Bottom line: &#8220;My life has been hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether one is pushed in harm&rsquo;s way (in this case by the government) or whether one willingly puts oneself in harm&rsquo;s way, the damage is the same, and it is irreparable.<br>

		<p>Nothing surprising here. Concentrating solely on black/White couples here. Take a black man/white woman couple and a White man/black woman couple. Which male is more likely to beat and otherwise abuse his spouse?? Which woman is thusly more likely to want out of the relationship? When you take in other factors, like which male is more likely to have and keep employment, which male is more likely to stray, which male more likely to expose his spouse to an std, which male is more likely to do drugs, etc, etc, it is no surprise that White women are more likely to want out of such a relationship.</p>

		<p>This article is, not surprisingly, full of mistakes.  For one, Hispanics DO comprise a different race from whites because a significant degree of their heritage is Native American.  (How ignorant could this writer be?!)  For another, there are a lot fewer white man/black woman marriages than the other combos, so of course there will be fewer divorces among them.  And, if white American women are so averse to interracial marriage  &mdash;  compared to other nationalities, presumably  &mdash;  then why is it so common to see them with black men (especially compared to white men with black women)?  I guess it could be because they&rsquo;re not actually married, in many instances, to the black men  &mdash;  who tend not to marry anybody.</p>

		<p>The answer to why white women are less likely to date outside is obvious from the other information reported in the article. </p>
<p>The higher divorce rates for white female/non-white male dyads means that white women who date and/or marry non-white men have a significantly greater chance of ending up divorced, single mothers. That means they also have a significantly greater chance of ending up POOR and ALONE with a bunch of mixed kids. A smart white women won&rsquo;t date outside if she can help it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not so much that women are more race conscious than men   &mdash;   otherwise you would see more women in racialist movements; they&rsquo;re just pickier in general. Women are not just more selective about a prospective mate&rsquo;s race, but about his income, height, &#8220;personality&#8221; (whatever that means), and a slew of other things that men find rather trivial. Of course, there is an obvious evolutionary explanation. In a state of nature, men have very little opportunity cost in mating. They can impregnate a random woman belonging to an outgroup and then impregnate a high status woman of their ingroup literally an hour later. Because women can only give birth once every nine months, however, they have to be more selective in their choice of mate. Also, there has always been a greater stigma against outbreeding for women than for men. When a man impregnated a foreign woman, it was a net genetic gain for the man, with no loss to the community. However, when a woman was impregnated by a foreigner, it meant that the community would be stuck raising a kid with half foreign genes and that the woman would have to wait another nine months before she could bear a child by a male of the community.</p>

		<p>Reply to poster #3</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe ALL male behaviour can be explained  because of feminism. We all are aware of the man-boy syndrome afflicting western civilization&hellip;.BUT how can feminism and the social revolution not be relevant in explaining  modern man&rsquo;s behaviour. I believe men&rsquo;s behaviour is reactionary to women&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>A few points:<br>
1) Men require a woman not to have too many sex partners pre-marriage. This is not sexist, it&rsquo;s biological. A promiscuous women is more likely to cheat and get bored with her marriage. Combined with the modern gyno-centric justice system, a fleet-of-foot woman is a BAD investment. Many white women rack double-digit stat sheets by their mid-20&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>2)Men and women are/and have never been equal. Women have strengths/men have strengths. When a woman is given a sports scholarship equal to that of a man THAT is inequality. Many white-feminist women seek a relationship based on &#8220;equality&#8221; a fictitious concept that will never exist. </p>
<p>3)Feminism since the 60&rsquo;s has been an attack on all things Western. White women have been the spearhead of the movement. Therefore many men have equated &#8220;self-empowered&#8221; blah blah blah, rhetoric from women as anti-white. </p>
<p>4) Men behave in ways to get laid. Feminism has given rise to the &#8220;metrosexual phenomena&#8221;-a movement were men beautify themselves to attract women. This behaviour might help a man pick-up a 20 something in College, but viewed socially, it&rsquo;s disastrous for a culture. Women are the gatekeepers of reproduction and men will adapt behaviours in order  to breach those gates to fulfill their biological obligations.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, and a million more, white feminist woman have positioned themselves as incompatible for relationships. Therefore many men opt for women from other cultures that understand the importance of family structure. These women are often less promiscuous and consequently make better marriage options. <br>

		<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s just men of color who are divorced more often, but examining that too closely might be a kind of &#8216;insensitivity&rsquo;. Then again this information too would be used to prove men of color are the real victims. </p>

		<p>Just last week in a trendy, upscale restaurant here in Pheonix I saw a White male/Black female with two biracial boys who looked to be about 10 and 8 years old. They were obviously the couple&rsquo;s children. Both the man and woman were very attractive. The man was in tip top shape and looked as if he had been an athlete in college or was very health consciuos. The children had on trendy looking clothes and ewere obviously very well taken care of.</p>
<p><br>

They were an attracitve couple and have two boys.  Both the man and woman are professionals.</p>

<p>As a gay Black man who sporadically posts on this website, I can tell you firsthand that there are MANY White men who are married to White women who are closeted gay men. While I do not make it a habit to sleep with or have affairs with married men, (in fact I have always found out after the fact)and I quickly have broken off any sort of sexual relationship with the person after I am aware of their marital circumstances, I can tell you firsthand this has happended to me more than a few times. I would argue that your post is misguided. </p>

		<p>Another way to view this article is that humans are naturally, universally selective.  In relationships, in marriage, who they associate with, who they vote for.  This is called discrimination, and every one does it.  Further proof, in the bedroom and voting booth, both places of privacy all races and ethnic groups prefer their own.  Not exclusively, but statistically.  Similarly the one group that is statistically most likely to consider other groups in the voting booth is whites.</p>

<p><b>What would be the advantage in marrying a black woman over telling your parents you are gay?  One they can eventually get over, the other they are stuck with nappy-headed grandkids.  In the last 30 or 40 years I can see no advantage in marrying black to cover for being gay.  And in fact I can see it as being a disadvantage: one is born homosexual (for what ever reason) but you pick your spouse in our society.</b></p>

You need to read Bruce Bower&rsquo;s book &#8220;A Place At The Table.&#8221; In his book he discusses the cousleing that he provides to so many suburban fathers (overwhelmingly White and married to White women) who are fathers and husbands. Some have struggled mightily with thier demons and finally admit to their spouses about their double lives. He was one of those men himself.</p>
<p><br>
I think part of the problem is that older White culture harshly denounced homosexuality almost to the point of homophobic paranoia. Whereas, our contemporary culture (especially White culture ) encourages and in some cases, almost embraces, this sort of activity. Thus, many White men are confused and stressed out as to how to respond to the conflicting signals they receive.</p>
<p>It must be a tormenting state of affairs to be confronted with.</p>

It&rsquo;s not so much that women are more race conscious than men  &mdash;  otherwise you would see more women in racialist movements; they&rsquo;re just pickier in general. Women are not just more selective about a prospective mate&rsquo;s race, but about his income, height, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; (whatever that means), and a slew of other things that men find rather trivial. Of course, there is an obvious evolutionary explanation. In a state of nature, men have very little opportunity cost in mating. They can impregnate a random woman belonging to an outgroup and then impregnate a high status woman of their ingroup literally an hour later. Because women can only give birth once every nine months, however, they have to be more selective in their choice of mate. Also, there has always been a greater stigma against outbreeding for women than for men. When a man impregnated a foreign woman, it was a net genetic gain for the man, with no loss to the community. However, when a woman was impregnated by a foreigner, it meant that the community would be stuck raising a kid with half foreign genes and that the woman would have to wait another nine months before she could bear a child by a male of the community.</p>

<p>I was in the military from 2000-2005 and I can tell you firsthand that there was a lot of interracial dating and in some cases, marriages, (including White male/Black female relationships) that happended during my tenure.</p>
<p>I can safely say that the vast majority, if not all, of these White men were heterosexual. I currently work as an administrator at a college in the northeast. There are two White men that I know who are married to Black women. There is nothing &#8220;homosexual &#8221; about them.</p>
<p><br>
I want to make it clear that I am against any sort of miscegenation as I am sure is the case with most AMRENERS; however, I do not think it serves us any good to resort to outlandish, almost laughable, easily dismissive assumptions just because we do not approve of something. </p>
<p>It is this sort of behavior that leaves us open to ridicule thst will do us more harm than good in the long run.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Why are the people on the original article site calling preferences &#8220;discrimination&#8221;? Many people have standards, many people realize they&rsquo;ve made a mistake later on (apparently, White women the most) &amp; some don&rsquo;t learn at all. And if a man/woman isn&rsquo;t attracted to someone, that&rsquo;s not a point of dispute; you are or aren&rsquo;t. Simple as that. &#8220;</p>
<p>The quick answer? Egalitarian Consumerism   &mdash;   Most people want to be fashionable and well liked. Over the last 30 - 60 years we have embraced debt-based consumer capitalism and incorporated wrong-headed ideas like &#8220;extreme equality&#8221; as a moral judgment in and of itself, regardless of a subject&rsquo;s aptitude, capacity, potential, etc. In other words, we treat dumb people like they&rsquo;re not dumb and smart people as if they&rsquo;re lucky mediocrities. Thus, the lowest common denominator reigns through a sociological natural selection of sorts.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present and now the majority (or a critical mass) of people, in order to stay fashionable and well liked, have a culturally ingrained need to *not* discriminate at all, lest they themselves be rightly discriminated against for supporting such a corrosive and paradoxical cultural establishment to begin with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horribly intractable state of affairs, but I think we&rsquo;ve turned a corner now w/ the worlds first truly free and representative press (the Internet &amp; social media). Mediocrity can no longer be instituted by centralized, controlled media and manufactured ideas like it once was. Baseless accusations of &#8220;Heresy!&#8221; in all of their forms (&#8216;racism&rsquo;, &#8216;bias&rsquo;, &#8216;anti-semetism&rsquo;, &#8216;discriminatory&rsquo;, etc) are now, rightly, being confronted in favor of more granular and clear-headed appraisals. The tide is slowly turning; and as the Baby Boomers retire and Gen X/Y enters, that pace is ever quickening.</p>
<p>As the least perceptive among us and other late-adopters transition from the all-but-dead medium of TV to the Internet, (and the mass opinion-forming social media that it necessitates), a self-organizing critical mass of opinion will emerge. One that will be woefully out-of-step w/ the prevailing establishment-imposed ideal (see: Arab Spring). That&rsquo;s when things will really start to change quite rapidly.</p>
<p>So I would encourage people to respectfully confront some of these people on more mainstream blogs and websites. Start letting the most fashionable among us know that it&rsquo;s time to start questioning what is actually &#8220;fashionable&#8221; in the 21st century and what ideas or &#8216;memes&rsquo; are longer going to elicit uncritical praise from one&rsquo;s peers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to shout. There&rsquo;s no need to accuse or lambaste, etc. They just need to know that the intellectual resistance they&rsquo;re meeting is genuine and not just a verbal attack from a single &#8216;misguided person&rsquo; whom they may quickly write-off as an aberration or exception.</p>
<p>Sorry to to hijack the thread, but these sorts of ideas bear repeating. For those of us who are &#8216;awake&rsquo;, let&rsquo;s do our best to jostle the fashionable herd into the 21st century *at the troughs themselves* (mainstream comment sections, etc), not the echo chamber of the choir.</p>

		<p>White women divorce their Black husbands because the Black male is of low stature and he also is a philanderer.<br>
<p><br>
Females are drawn to males because of high status and ability to provide.<br>
<p><br>
The Mainstream Media and the state school systems bestowed on the black male a false look of high status.  The MSM and state schools also instill in White a guilt feeling towards Blacks that White females often atone for by giving themselves to Blacks.<br>
<p><br>
No organized pro-White group opposes this false picture of Black males.  Thus foolish White women find them attractive and the very foolish White female marry them<br>
<p><br>
But reality sets in and they find the Black husband quit inadequate, plus the Black male is a notorious philander which means that he is investing his resources on other females.<br>
<p><br>
If schools and the MSM returned to more sensible times and told the truth about Black males the divorce rate would drop because the marriage rate would drop.<br>

<p>&#8220;A few points:&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you mean, &#8220;A few questions?&#8221;  You sound like a fairly simple female, full of stereoptypical feminist jargon and ignorance of the imbalances that 40 years of Feminist politics and results from things they pushed like AA and Protected Groups, that even the MSM is reporting lately.  Better for you to read up on the subject than write a book here for you.  Try reading some Tammy Bruce books such as &#8220;The New Thought Police,&#8221; or another woman, former feminist who wrote, &#8220;The War on Boys.&#8221;  Men never called for white women&rsquo;s extermination (NOW did) nor did white men ever advertise their abandonment of their opposite sex for their own gain as a sexual political group.</p>
<p>&hellip;..&#8221; And if a man/woman isn&rsquo;t attracted to someone, that&rsquo;s not a point of dispute; you are or aren&rsquo;t. Simple as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not that simple.  Huge efforts are being made to influence people on who they ought to choose.  I am surprised at this report and will need more corroborating reports.  But it does fit into the recent story that many companies are going back to hiring white men because they can&rsquo;t afford the AA and Protected groups experiment any longer.  After 40+ years of social engineering aimed at destroying white males as an identifiable group, they are making a comeback due to the reality of hard times and bottom line austerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are women &amp; (genuine) feminism always blamed for everything that is wrong with the world? Men have ruled &amp; oppressed for most of history.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is your stereotype.  Why do you buy that men have &#8220;ruled and oppressed for most of history?&#8221;  Because some feminists told you so?  Perhaps a little more life experience or education will teach you about real history.  Women used to need men, but modern life made them seem less necessary.  But when the chips were down at the Superdome in New Orleans during the Katrina crisis, the Australian women trapped there took protection behind their men,who fended off blacks who were trying to grab them and pull them out for certain purposes.  You represent a spoiled, elitist, and tragically distorted interpretation of society and your place in it.  That is why you are asking so many questions here.</p>
<p>The MSM just reported that less women in the US are running for office than ever, way down from the peak of female candidacy in 1994, or so.  One WOMAN simply said that women don&rsquo;t really like the hustle and fighting that goes with politics.  Yeah I know, they really just want the nice, secure, government jobs with great benefits, which is where they have taken over in force, thanks to the leg up of AA and Protected Groups legislations that NOW pushed.  And speaking of oppression and suppression, NOW actually proclaimed in the late 1980s that having white children was evil.</p>

As to whether white men really are attracted to black women because they&rsquo;ve obviously created vast mulatto populations:<br>
Of course, when there aren&rsquo;t enough white women around, white men have sex with whatever women are.  And, until recently in Western civilization, most white women did not provide casual sex.  A number of American white men went down to the ghetto, where they often didn&rsquo;t even have to pay for it.  Black women were glad to have the status of a light-skinned child.<br>

		<p>If white women marry outside their race, then divorce, this doesn&rsquo;t prove a higher rate of race consciousness.  A race conscious woman wouldn&rsquo;t miscegenate in the first place.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the data does seem to sugest that the mere presence of a white woman in a marriage increses the likelihood of divorce, regardless of the male spouse&rsquo;s race.  And they wonder why white men are driven to Asian women.</p>

		<p><b>@ #11 Myopic Governance</b>:</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I think there are many double standards in you post, the very same ones that caused some American women to react the way they have (I&rsquo;m not American, btw).</p>
<p>Men&rsquo;s behaviour depend on women&rsquo;s behaviour? EXACTLY&hellip;that&rsquo;s something people need to think about. One can&rsquo;t take all &amp; give nothing.</p>
<p>1. BOTH sexes are likely to cheat more when promiscuous, not just women. You can&rsquo;t have double standards. ANd it&rsquo;s not just WHite women (or Black women) who are likely to have multiple partners. </p>
<p>Is it acceptable to males to whore themselves out &amp; return to the chruch 10 yrs later as damaged goods with the expectation of finding innocent virgins to which they demand total submission &amp; devotion? </p>
<p>2. Men &amp; women ARE equal. Stop this ridiculous &amp; childish nonsense espoused by so many men that equal is the same as identical. Original feminist doctrine never said anything about being &#8220;identical: &amp; most women KNOW this. The crazy ones who rant on about eliminating gender references are mostly ignored by women &amp; hardly anyone listens to what they say. They&rsquo;re merely exploited in order to distract the masses &amp; cause societal chaos.</p>
<p>Recognizing complementarity between men &amp; women means not being offended when they don&rsquo;t wish to devote their lives worshipping a man, &amp; males giving their females some care &amp; respect.</p>
<p>I agree with you that those incidents of letting males compete with females in sport is beyond ludicrous, but those aren&rsquo;t the norm, just exploitation PR. </p>
<p>3. If you feel that feminism was manipulated to make the white male look bad, all you need to do is show women what happens to Muslim women, &amp; they&rsquo;ll know that they have it pretty good.<br>
You don&rsquo;t even need to look beyond your own doorstep, as Muslims (& Blacks, including Black Muslims, an awful combination) are responsible for the rape epidemic in Europe. [They don&rsquo;t document the crimes in their own nations, so it looks like Muslim nations are rape-free.]</p>
<p>Again, feminism gave men a chance to make better husbands &amp; fathers by forging deeper bonds with their children &amp; partners. I find it a little suspicious when I hear all these American men complaining about how they&rsquo;re so perfect &amp; their women are so awful. It goes both ways. You can&rsquo;t take &amp; demand and expect to give nothing in return.</p>
<p>I know that some American women have inexcusably bad attitudes to men, but to categorize all educated, working women as &#8220;feminist&#8221;, assuming this is used as an insult, is biased.</p>

<p>I am not a supporter of the so-called &#8220;radical feminist&#8221; theory, though so many are quick to assume that because I didn&rsquo;t pour scorn on the notion of women (not just White women) not devoting their entire lives to men.</p>
<p>I assume that Asian women, coming from a particular culture &amp; in the case of Thai women, probably an alternative option of sex tourism, they are contented to be in an arrangement that provides them with a better standard of living, so are happy to cater to a possibly weaker male ego.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having higher standards for a relationship. What works for some won&rsquo;t work for others. </p>
<p>And what I want to know is if the supposed horrific behaviour of American women is an exaggeration. I was not necessarily defending them, just trying to be fair.<br>

		<p>As a White woman I cannot understand why any White woman would date outside her race, especially Black or Mexican.</p>
<p>Blacks and Mexicans have VERY strong racial historical grievances against Whites. Why would a White woman date a man who would bring up slavery or the Mexican/American War? Maybe <br>
she has already been programmed to accept feeling guilty and shamed.<br>
 <br>
The couple of times in my life when I simply had a conversation with a Black or Hispanic they would, at the oddest times in the oddest ways, bring up race. I believe many of them want to date  and/or marry White women because they then have a chance of controlling her through guilt and shame.</p>

		<p>Razib usually has some interesting insights, but he&rsquo;s a bit off on some of his conclusions. The fact that white women are more likely to divorce minority husbands (and let&rsquo;s be frank about this, the vast majority of these will be black or hispanic men) is not a reflection of white women being &#8216;prejudiced&rsquo;. If they were interested in maintaining racial purity of the &#8216;volk&rsquo; as he put it, they never would&rsquo;ve dated or certainly not married the minority in the first place. It is a reflection of the fact that undesirable spousal behaviors such as abuse,cheating, crime, poor father to the children, poor provider, etc. are higher among NAMs than among white men. Point the finger at the NAM men, not white women.</p>

<p>Good post - to the point.</p>
<p>But  might I add one item you left out.  Blacks usually use racism as a means for gaining access.  In the 1960s, blacks in my high school would yell, &#8220;That&rsquo;s prejudiced!&#8221; in class at anything, any act to counter their aggressiveness.

Several months in the New York Times there was a front page story about a White male/ Black female in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, both came from upper income families, who met one another at the University of Mississippi and ended up marrying one another. They were an attracitve couple and have two boys. Both the man and woman are professionals.</p>
<p>Mind you, Mississippi, the deep south. I had to do a double take. at the article. </p>

		<p>Answer to Number 3&rsquo;s question why do White men go for Asian women.</p>
<p>For the same reason one sees so many White women black male couples.  Asian women pursue White men  as ardently as black men pursue White women although for different reasons. People respond to an ardent pursuit.</p>
<p>I attend a university that is half Asian.  Here is what I have observed and what Asian girls tell me.</p>
<p>First and foremost green cards.</p>
<p>Second Height and skin color.  </p>
<p>Asians are very prejudiced against short height and dark skin.  Being short means your parents and ancestors were poor people who could not afford enough food.  So the children and grandchildren show the effects of poverty and low status.  Like wearing a badge that says I and all my ancestors are and were poor.</p>
<p>Dark skin in Asia means your are a poor peasant, worker or fisherman.  American asians like to dye their hair brown or auborn.  But in the old days dark brown hair meant one was a poor laboror whose hair got bleached from slaving away in the sun all day.  Asian women often dye their dark brown hair dead black because of this.</p>
<p>The Asian girls want tall light skinned babies.  I have never seen a mixed White Asian couple with the man being short and dark skinned.  The men are always Northern European looking.<br>
Asian families want the boys to marry Asian girls.  They don&rsquo;t care so much about the girls.  They sure are proud of the White looking tall grandchildren though.  Many Asian families encourage green card marriages.</p>
<p>Third &#8220;Idon&rsquo;t want to marry anyone like my Father&#8221; Despite the fact that Asian women have careers and fulltime jobs the same as other women, Asian fathers and husbands rule the roost.  They are patriarchs whose word is law. This conflicts with the anti male propaganda girls are force fed in American schools.  It is a typical immigrant culture conflict as well.</p>
<p>The Asian girls see Asian young men as someone who will not be a tyrannical husband like their Fathers.</p>
<p>Asian girls really chase tall, fair skinned White men.  I see it all the time. If Asian girls call up men and White girls keep turning him down, the men will end up with the girls who want him. </p>
<p>They seem to be happy long lasting couples. There are a lot of mixed Asian Causasian students at my school.  They all seem to be happy with their families, happier than a lot of the asian students are with their asian families.</p>
<p>Asians stick together and give each other jobs, rent apartments ahd help each other.  Many a White man who is accustommed to the White American dog eat dog way of life is pleasantly surprised with the way the his wife&rsquo;s  Asian tribal and family networks help with jobs, housing, loans, major purchases, baby sitting and other things.</p>

		<p># 35 wrote &#8220;And speaking of oppression and suppression, NOW actually proclaimed in the late 1980s that having white children was evil.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was NOW that pushed a federal Judge to issue orders that goverment agencies that still have written exams classify the White women who score highest on the exams to be classified as White male profile for purposes of discrimination.</p>
<p>NOW and other feminists have lately been inserting articles in Women&rsquo;s magazines that it is wrong to tell your pretty daughter that she is pretty.  It is also wrong to dress your pretty daughter attractively.  Hair must be cut butch short.</p>
<p>No one ever told me I was pretty.  But when I was about 12 I looked in the mirror and noted that I looked enough like Elizabeth Taylor to be her daughter.  So I knew I was more than pretty.</p>
<p>I agree with #35 that feminazis are just one more communist front group funded by the elites with the purpose of destroying western civilization.</p>
<p>The most hypocritical thing about the feminazis is their alliance with black and hispanic men.  Black and hispanic men commit most of the rapes in this country.  Feminazis claim to be against rape.  How can a group allied with most of the rapists be against rape?</p>
<p>The feminazis anti rape crusade was directed at the White male police and district attorneys who arrested and convicted the black rapists.  But as soon as the feminazis discovered that most of the rapists were their black and hispanic allies the anti rape crusade was called off.</p>
<p>One thing a feminazi will never admit.  Virtually all their so called gains are because of goverment threats and pressure and outright orders to employers. More in the style of Lenin firing all the pre revolution employees and ordering evey employer to hire only members of the communist party.  Feminazis would not have their jobs had not some Judge or EEOC type goverment agency ordered the employer to hire less qualified females.</p>
<p>By the way Ms # 3 feminazi, I will spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair because of malpractice by 22 female Drs over a period of 6 years.  I fell and fractured my knee and hip.  For 6 years I asked 22 female Drs, most non White immigrants for a simple xray.  They all refused on the grounds that I must have sciatica or pulled back muscles.  By the time one of those rare species, a White male Dr xrayed me on my request, both hipbones and one knee bone and most of one thigh bone had just rotted away.</p>
<p>I will never, never use a female or minority Dr again.  I am active in my local senior center and my large city senior organizations.  I spread the word about female Drs. It seems to be sticking. I am young to be so disabled. I have 25 years to devote to spreading the word about the dangers of using a female dr.  I am telling my tale all over the place.  People need to be informed about the dangers of using affirmative action female MDs.  Or as I call them, morons pretending to be doctors.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why is it always writers with names like Razib Khan who are obsessed with white mating habits?&#8221;</p>
<p>A better question would be why do media outlets have to recruit from overseas to find the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; element capable of writing for their paper? Are they just there to take up jobs Americans don&rsquo;t want to do? </p>
<p>Is this discrimination against people of color born in America? Wouldn&rsquo;t the same organizations ordinarily be the first ones to investigate claims of discrimination against people of color? Are these papers not written in the first place, or geared toward appeasing persons of color who already live here? Or is it a matter of ethics? It&rsquo;s Ok to exclude Americans of color if a certain amount of whites are displace in the process or if or X amount of color is thrown into the boiler? Or is it Ok to discriminate against people of color, those in your own neighborhoods and town, if you give enough hiring preference to other persons of color? And these persons of color will then be likely to hire other persons of color? Because, they all know of each others special disadvantage and oppression, and not because, well, whatever it was ignorant right-wing folk might have thought this special, discerning, hiring pattern and &#8216;giving back&rsquo; activity was about? Should there be more questions asked? Perhaps this magazine would know about that. </p>

<p>&#8220;This article is, not surprisingly, full of mistakes. For one, Hispanics DO comprise a different race from whites because a significant degree of their heritage is Native American. (How ignorant could this writer be?!)&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer is actually correct, and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; are not a race,  Amerindian IS a race, of course, but many millions of hispanics have no Amerind ancestry (such as, for example, the entire population of Spain).</p>
<p>Think about it: if Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias, the reigning King of Spain from the House of Bourbon, were to move to the USA for whatever reason, he would be given a privileged status not for being royalty but for being of a &#8220;marginalized&#8221;, &#8220;underprivileged&#8221;, and &#8220;socially disadvantaged&#8221; &#8220;minority group&#8221;. If he were forced to abdicate and came as a refugee, the privileges open to King Juan would be even greater. </p>
<p>I have known a small number of actual white hispanics, and have even dated some of these White Latinas at points past. They are no less white than any other group of whites in America, even if they are not &#8220;Whites&#8221; in distinctly ethnic-American sense. One was even a ginger! They are certainly couldn&rsquo;t be considered less white than the many Irish-,Italian-,or Polish-Americans that abound in my area (after a century-plus, many descending from the waves of migration pre-1924 are still quite unassimilated, in an awkward middle ground where they are neither exactly like any of the existing European peoples, nor indistinguishable from the Americans in Flyoverland. The &#8220;melting pot&#8221; is a small-capacity implement indeed).</p>
<p>A better way to look at Hispanics than as a single (and non-biological!) &#8220;race&#8221; is by the way the Hispanics themselves understand it-by blood purity. As it stands, there are white Hispanics (Spaniards and assimilated other Europeans in countries like Argentina) and non-white ones (Amerinds from homelands conquered by the Spanish Empire, mestizos of mixed Amerind and Caucasoid ancestry, mulattos of mixed black/Caucasoid[and Amerind?] ancestry, and occasionally other odd cases like the all-Japanese former President of Peru, Alberto Fujimori).</p>
<p>Of course, probably 97% of the people in the US who are in the privileged &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; class are of the brown, non-white group. </p>
<p>Not only is &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; not a race, or even much of anything other than arbitrary designation of privilege granted by the tyrannical US government and political class, who became fed up with the Wasps/White Anglophones (i.e., Americans proper), and have chosen to &#8220;elect a new people&#8221; consisting of many colored minorities. All the term really implies is some connection to some place where the Spanish language was/is the primary administrative language. Many &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; who have invaded this country from Mexico can&rsquo;t even speak SPANISH but can only use their Amerind./Mixtec/Myan/Aztec/whatever tongues!<br>

<p>I appreciate your response.</p>
<p>I stand corrected, it sounds like you are an &#8220;equality feminist&#8221;, similar to Christina Hoff Sommers, whom I have nothing but respect for.</p>
<p>I agree with you that women and men are complementary, but we always have been complementary, history has simply been distorted regarding white history. Why, in a French history class I read the literary works of a noble woman, written in the 18th century, a time most men were illiterate. I know you will appreciate my point by saying, can we name a single muslim country were women are freely writing romantically-themed plays? In the 21st century?</p>
<p>I disagree however with your claim that I possess double standards. The sexual habits of men and women are different from an evolutionary standpoint. Men desire youth-and-beauty, women-seek resource providers. Which makes perfect sense, but feminism (every branch) has complained about &#8220;labels&#8221;-slut, whore, stud etc- and wished to &#8220;deconstruct&#8221; these words until they are rendered meaningless. You may be aware of the recent &#8220;slut walks&#8221; which illustrate this ridiculousness. The truth is that Sean Connery can attract women, but an Oprah Winfrey repels men. A high status male can seduce any number of young women, but the status of a woman is almost meaningless when it comes to attracting a mate. I used Oprah as an example, because she&rsquo;s a dog-faced billionaire, and the first part is repellant to men, despite the second part.</p>

		<p> White and White Hispanic have a slighter higher rate than White/White marriage. The difference maybe too small to come up with a reason. You many find the same small difference between many other combination of White ethnic groups or between Asian and Asian Hispanic marriage.</p>
<p>Black husband/White wife. This higher divorce rate than other marriages may due mainly to economics as money is often the main reason many marriages fall apart and Black males tend to lose their jobs at an higher rate than White males. </p>
<p>Asian husband/White wife. The divorce rate is 60 percent greater than white/white marriage according to the article but less than<br>
Black husband/White wife marriage. The higher income of the Asian male  may be the reason the rate is not as high as the Black husband/White wife rate. But assuming that the Asian male in these marriage were more likely to be raised abroad, cultural difference may be factor as he may view his American wife as too &#8216;liberated&rsquo;.</p>
<p>White husband/Black wife. The divorce rate is lower than White/White marriage. These marriage maybe between couples who are more educated than the other types of marriage. Many professional Afro-American women complain of not finding suitable Black males to marry. These professional women may value marriage more than others as it is difficult for them to find compatable Black males. I believe that the higher rate of educated Black women in comparison to Black males resulted in White males in these relationship having more choices. And these<br>
Afro-American females work harder to keep the marriage.</p>
<p><br>
Asian /white couples more likely to divorce than Asian/<br>
Asian couples . Since just one person is needed for a divorce, culture may be a factor as Asians  probably are more likely to fight to save their marriage as they may take into consideration strongly how their parents would a fail marriage . </p>
<p> Hispanic white/ white couples showed an higher rate of divorce than Hispanic/Hispanic. As stated culture is a factor (some <br>
culture frowns upon divorce more than others, it may be because<br>
of religion eg. being a catholic) . The economic arrangement is<br>
also a factor such as  whether both partners are employed and can independently survive economically if there is a split or one partner is economically dependent on the other for financial support. </p>

<p>This is not  the case and most white women dont date men of any race  because they fear that they would be viewed as racist.<br>
There are black males who pursue white females,and there are white females who pursue black males. There are people of different races who interact with each other at work, gym,<br>
 college, etc., and they  like the person regardless of race.<br>
This may lead to a relationship. <br>
It may be good for the ego to say that white women date black men because of the fear of being called a racist but it is not true. </p>

<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>No one can force anyone to date them if the person in question refuses to do so. The fact is that there are people (of all races and both genders)who willingly engage in interracial relationships whether it be a friendship, sexual relationship, athletic relationship etc&hellip;</p>
<p>As anonymous stated while it may be psychologically expedient to argue that people resort to interracial relationships due to fear of being called racist, the reality is otherwise.</p>

		<p>One reason why Asian American women fall for white men is that the most favorable images of men seen in the media are white. Asian men are often seen as the enemy in war movies or are seen as weak, working as servants such as Hop Sing in Bonanza. Also Asian women do not see Asian men as attractive. I know when I was growing up, the best looking men were we saw were white or black but none were Asian.</p>

Nothing surprising here. Concentrating solely on black/White couples here. Take a black man/white woman couple and a White man/black woman couple. Which male is more likely to beat and otherwise abuse his spouse?? Which woman is thusly more likely to want out of the relationship? When you take in other factors, like which male is more likely to have and keep employment, which male is more likely to stray, which male more likely to expose his spouse to an std, which male is more likely to do drugs, etc, etc, it is no surprise that White women are more likely to want out of such a relationship.</p>

<p>Statistics prove that White men, especially upper income White men are much more likely to cheat on their spouses than men of color. Moreover, I have a physician friend who informed me that the group of peopel that he treats with STD&rsquo;s are White men between the ages of 25 and 50. In fact, he told me that he could survive alone in treating STD&#8221;s from men of this demographic as well as how often these men get vasectomies so that they can fool around on their wives. </p>

<p>White men are portrayed in the media   &mdash;   TV ads and TV shows   &mdash;   as stupid, spineless, helpless wimps in need of saving by intelligent blacks; blacks are inevitably brilliant doctors or scientists, presidents, strong leaders, offering up advice and wisdom to stupid whites.

<p>You made me laugh. Are you serious? You&rsquo;ve got your facts totally wrong. Go to the CDC website. Blacks (men &amp; women) have the higher rate of STDs, much higher than White men, especially in that age group you mentioned. That&rsquo;s been an indisputable fact for quite some time now. One doc&rsquo;s opinion/experience does not necessarily reflect the reality. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common knowledge that an estimated almost half of the Black female population in the US are infected with STDs. The study came out recently. Black men don&rsquo;t fare much better.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that anyone would actually proclaim that Black men have a lower STD rate than White men. That&rsquo;s priceless.</p>

<p>So, once more, once again:</p>
<p>The CDC reports:</p>
<p>Gonorrhea: <i>Of all the cases of gonorrhea reported to the CDC in 2005, 68% occurred in African Americans. It is 18 times more prevalent among African Americans than whites</i></p>
<p>Chlamydia: <i>An estimated 41.6% of all chlamydial infection cases reported in 2005 occurred among African Americans. The rate ratio shows the disease striking African Americans eight times more often than whites.</i></p>
<p>HIV/AIDS:. <i>Blacks account for almost half (46%) of people living with a diagnosis of HIV infection in the 37 states and 5 US dependent areas with long-term, confidential, name-based HIV reporting&hellip;compared with members of other races and ethnicities blacks continue to account for a higher proportion of cases at all stages of HIV &mdash; from new infections to deaths.</i></p>
<p>Primary and secondary syphilis: <i>Of the primary and secondary (i.e., recently acquired) syphilis cases reported in 2005, roughly 41% occurred among African Americans.</i></p>
<p>Cervical Cancer:  <i>A fact that seems to be unknown by many men and women is that HPV has been detected in 90% to 100% of all cervical cancer cases.<br>
White:  7.9 per 100,000 women  Black:  10.1 per 100,000 women.</i></p>
<p>Source, CDC data base:  <a href="http://goo.gl/btpEM" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/btpEM</a></p>
<p>http://goo.gl/EtvDO</p>
<p>The CDC tries to explain away the black/White STD infection rate disparity by blaming poverty, no access to health care, lack of education   &mdash;   anything BUT black promiscuity and/or refusal to use condoms.</p>
<p>I will keep repeating racial STD FACTS until it becomes common knowledge everywhere; please post them wherever and whenever you can so I don&rsquo;t have to keep cutting and pasting this SAME post to clear up the SAME misinformation.</p>
