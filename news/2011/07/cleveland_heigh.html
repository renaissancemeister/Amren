<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>This city, known for its liberalism, tolerance and racial diversity, finds itself in the thick of a social dilemma: How do you crack down on trouble-making groups of teenagers  &mdash;  mostly black  &mdash;  without violating civil rights or appearing to be racist?</p>
<p>In the wake of disruptions at the Coventry Street Fair on Sunday by hundreds of the teens, the city kicked into emergency mode, adopting a draconian curfew Wednesday. The new law, which took effect Thursday, prohibits anyone under 18 to be in the Coventry Village or Cedar-Lee commercial areas after 6 p.m. unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new curfew provides a few exceptions, such as for a minor running an errand for a parent or working in the commercial districts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s street fair, held between 12:30 p.m. and 6 p.m., attracted thousands of people from all over Greater Cleveland. About 5 p.m., large groups of the teens rushed through the crowd, pushing people over and sparking fights.</p>
<p>The upheaval spilled into nearby upper-middle-class, mostly white neighborhoods. Neighbors said they witnessed large groups of young black men walking in the middle of quiet, tree-lined side streets shouting profanities and racial epithets.</p>
<p>Someone tossed an empty liquor bottle on the sidewalk at the home of Paula Coakley on East Overlook Road. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Hey, you dropped something,&#8221; said Coakley. &#8220;But they just laughed and kept walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down on the corner of East Overlook and Washington Boulevard, a group of about 25 teens gathered to egg on two kids squaring off for a fistfight. Homeowner Joy Roller called the police and yelled at the gang to keep moving. She said she was met with shouts of profanity.</p>
<p>Roller said the police told her, &#8220;We know, it&rsquo;s going on all over the city now.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite wide support for the new curfew, some people are bothered by what they view as an undercurrent of racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police Chief Jeffrey Robertson, acknowledging the street fair melees were triggered by young blacks, said the city&rsquo;s response would have been the same if the brawlers had been white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The county prosecutor&rsquo;s office said Michael Madison of Cleveland Heights, along with his wife and two friends, were leaving Anatolia Cafe when Madison was jumped by a black teenager who was backed by other teens. The teenager, a juvenile, called to his friends, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madison suffered broken facial bones and had to get stitches. The teenager has been charged with felonious assault and aggravated robbery, according to a spokesman for the prosecutor&rsquo;s office. The teen is scheduled for a court appearance this month.</p>

		<p>Gee, isn&rsquo;t this profiling teens?  Why not a curfew for everybody?  Equality and non-discrimination demands that no one group is at a disadvantage to another.  </p>

		<p>Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights are two bordering communities that pioneered the &#8220;managed&#8221; integration movement in the 60&rsquo;s. Now most of the libs have left, and those that have stayed send their children to private schools, inspite of extremely high property taxes. Both communities remind me of Baltimore, in that they have a mix of moderately priced homes and very high end homes. Both of these cities struggle to control the mess that blacks have caused, with predictable results. They just can&rsquo;t bring themselves to admit they were wrong, at least not publicly. I&rsquo;m sure many will admit they wrong privately, however.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible, because &#8220;liberalism, tolerance and diversity,&#8221; beget &#8220;trouble making groups of mostly black teenagers.&#8221;  Actions have consequences.</p>
<p><i>In the wake of disruptions at the Coventry Street Fair on Sunday by hundreds of the teens, the city kicked into emergency mode, adopting a draconian curfew Wednesday. The new law, which took effect Thursday, prohibits anyone under 18 to be in the Coventry Village or Cedar-Lee commercial areas after 6 p.m. unless accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.</i></p>
<p>This reads to me like Cleveland Heights wants to become one of those rumored &#8220;sundown towns.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have said it before both here and on my own soapbox, and stories like these only drive home the point.  Left unfettered and left to their own devices, anyone who has governing responsibility over blacks, be they white racialists, white liberals, other blacks (even other blacks that made a career out of opposing segregation), or anyone for that matter, will, subconsciously, salami-slicing style, one by one, bit by bit, piece by piece, institute or re-institute something eerily similar to Jim Crow or segregation apartheid.  Obviously thanks to the Federal government, we&rsquo;re not left unfettered and to our own devices in that regard.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They complain no one cares about them or is doing anything but when something is done, they scream &#8216;racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a waste of time trying to help blacks so don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t.<br>

Better questions might be: why did whites in states with large black populations pass Jim Crow laws? Was it irrational color prejudice? </p>

<p>The days of the Left are counting. </p>
<p>With the Left&rsquo;s failure to solve the issue (more concerned with the target of minorities then actual safety), the rise of the Right will be inevitable. Bringing herald to a new era where stuff like this won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It will be humorous to see the Left baffled as to why the Right will soon dominate.</p>

		<p>These mob attacks mostly happen in White neighborhoods now. I live about a half hour fron Cleveland Heights. It once was an affluent White and Asian area. Now over the last 15 years, it&rsquo;s been taken over by &#8220;less fortunate&#8221; minorities. Now I have gone over to that area (not at night of course), for some excellent Chinese dining. But this was a powder keg waiting to happen. </p>

		<p>in an old history book on Rome published in the 1880s I recall seeing a picture of battle with swords and spears and under it the legend that the Romans called in the army to handle rebellious youth.  Few such youths survived to become adults.  Punishment was direct and to the sword point.  Perhaps we could learn from the Romans</p>

		<p>As bad as this may sound, I hope these flashmob attacks continue and in a big way. This may just prove to be the catalyst that awakens America and brings on the inevitability. Black rage is being unleashed and the apologists are clamoring for excuses but finding out that talk is cheap. Protect your loved ones.<br>

		<p>I can hardly wait to see how a curfew on all people based on age is construed as racist.  More black people are under 18?  Or more curfew violators are black?</p>
<p>I fondly recall the blatantly racist curfew in my home town growing up in South Africa. There was a curfew siren at 9pm, and all blacks had to be off the streets, or back in their segregated townships.  It was great. Kids could walk in perfect safety anywhere in the (White) city. Good old days.</p>

<p>Cleveland&rsquo;s curfew starts at 6pm. But&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
<i>Sunday&rsquo;s street fair, held between 12:30 p.m. and 6 p.m., attracted thousands of people from all over Greater Cleveland. About 5 p.m., large groups of the teens rushed through the crowd, pushing people over and sparking fights.</i></p>
<p><br>
Then clearly the curfew is not only needed, but should start EARLIER. Like noon. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve commented before how, as a young school kid in Lawton, OK. we could play &#8220;Kick the Can&#8221; at any hour we wished or that our parents (plural) would allow us to stay out and none of my friends were EVER robbed, raped, murdered, kidnapped or arrested! Anyone know how Lawton is now? From other commenters on my comment, I know that other White cities of the 50s were the same.</p>

<p>Automatic gunfire. Be sure to clean each and every round as you clip it to clean it of fingerprints. In the heat of the moment one cannot take time to police up the brass.</p>

		<p>it is only PC-ok to target the &#8220;majority&#8221; for derision and hatred. unless you are in south africa, where it is ok to hate the &#8220;minority&#8221; because the &#8220;majority&#8221; is black. Whites have not had &#8220;White privilege&#8221; for a very long time. (though now, the term is used to refer to Whites natural cognitive superiority, while maintaining the lie of &#8220;equality&#8221;).<br>

		<p>Maybe if these kids parents actually watched and monitored what their teens are doing it wouldn&rsquo;t have come to this! This same thing is happening in other areas too and it is not a racial issue!  It is the last resort to try and bring peace and safety to those who are running businesses in the area and the shoppers as well. I would not go there if there were large numbers of kids crowding the sidewalks looking for trouble! Especially after hearing about shootings, and people getting jumped and robbed in Cleveland!</p>
<p>Imposing curfews in areas being over run by out of control teens is nothing new and it&rsquo;s not a racism issue. The only reason it would be viewed as race issue by some is because the majority of the kids who are causing the problems are of a particular race! That doesn&rsquo;t make the law racist, but it does show that if it&rsquo;s one particular race of people causing the problems then of course it will also reflect in those who are charged and fined!</p>
<p>Because those are the ones who will be affected by the new curfew&hellip;.you know&hellip;the ones causing the problems! If they are out after curfew regardless of skin color they will be ticketed. I am so sick of everything being twisted and manipulated into a race issue! It&rsquo;s actually kind of funny if you really think about it. The new ticketing rules for those who jump onto public transportation in Cleveland without paying was said to be a racist issue, when the truth is that it&rsquo;s mostly one particular race who are abusing the system and not paying! If you want to take the stance of George and ACLU or whoever then you might as well say that since it&rsquo;s mostly one particular race breaking the laws then those people themselves are racist because they think they should get away with committing crimes because of their race! Just like they say that due to the high numbers of Blacks convicted and jailed etc..that the police are racist and profiling Blacks&hellip;..did it NOT occur to old George that the reason more blacks are in jail is because in that city more of them are committing crimes and getting caught?  Duh?</p>
<p>If parents did what they are supposed to be doing&hellip;.monitoring their offspring&hellip;.then there would NOT be a need for a curfew! But as it stands many parents let their kids run the streets and don&rsquo;t care what they are out doing as long as they are out of the parents hair. There is a curfew now at some weekend out door concert near Akron somewhere too, for the same problem&hellip;.out of control teens causing problems. So NO it&rsquo;s not about race but about teens causing problems, if it turns out that it&rsquo;s mostly a certain race getting ticketed then it&rsquo;s obvious that it&rsquo;s due to that race causing problems!</p>
