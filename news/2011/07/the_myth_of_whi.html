<h1><a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2011/07/the_myth_of_white_privilege.html">The Myth of White Privilege</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Selwyn Duke, American Thinker, July 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, it isn&rsquo;t really true that we Caucasians get together in a big conference hall somewhere and, rubbing our hands together with devilish glee, conspire as to how we&rsquo;re gonna get ourselves some&rsquo;a that there white privilege.  Yet you wouldn&rsquo;t know it listening to egghead academics, media mouths, and uncivil rights agitators.</p>
<p>Put &#8220;white privilege&#8221; into a search engine and no small number of results will be for &#8220;.edu&#8221; URLs, which means that our mental institutions of higher learning are busy teaching &#8220;critical race theory&#8221; and ideas such as &#8220;Whites are taught not to recognize white privilege&#8221; and that, as this University of Dayton site informs, white persons have a &#8220;special freedom or immunity from some [liabilities or burdens] to which non-white persons are subject[.]&#8221;  There is also something called &#8220;The White Privilege Conference&#8221; and a website devoted to it (I actually had to log on to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t a spoof site, but truth is stranger  &mdash;  and stupider  &mdash;  than fiction).  And American Thinker recently wrote about an event called &#8220;Erasing White Privilege,&#8221; during which whites sat around in a room confessing their collective oppressor sins while &#8220;people of color&#8221; discharged rage, &#8220;yelling at them&#8221; and &#8220;preaching.&#8221;  Ain&rsquo;t Obama&rsquo;s post-racial America grand?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>White privilege is a myth.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the facts.  Because of the fashionable discrimination known as affirmative action, whites (males especially) are often untouchables in the job market. {snip} Then there is the Dayton, OH police department, which recently discarded its recruit exam and the scores of 748 people who passed it because not doing so would have resulted in too many whites being hired.</p>
<p>And there is social discrimination as well.  While black comedians can use derogatory terms for whites such as &#8220;cracker,&#8221; white comedians who use corresponding anti-black racial epithets risk career destruction.  A racial slur isn&rsquo;t even necessary for a white person to incur the thought police&rsquo;s wrath. {snip}<br>
	<br>
There is also a trove of government programs designed to aid minorities  &mdash;  such as those geared toward minority-owned businesses  &mdash;  but no corresponding help for whites.  And, as whistleblowers recently revealed, our Department of Justice has long been ignoring voting-rights cases when the victims have been white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And what about blacks&rsquo; dominance in mainstream sports?  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be ridiculous to talk about &#8220;black athletic privilege&#8221;?</p>
<p>Group-specific success isn&rsquo;t just an American phenomenon, either. {snip}</p>
<p>So while we could prattle on about Chinese privilege in Malaysia or those privileged Japanese boys from Brazil, it would be wiser to accept a simple truth: There is simply no evidence that all groups can succeed equally in every endeavor.</p>
<p>And this brings us to the real prejudice at work here.  Whether it&rsquo;s Jewish Nobel Prize-winners, blacks in the athletic arena, or something else, we generally give credit where it is due.</p>
<p>Except when the relatively successful group is white people.</p>
<p>Then they are guilty  &mdash;  of discrimination, oppression, and victimization  &mdash;  and will never be proven innocent.  Their success just must have come at the expense of others, no matter what the facts say.</p>

		<p>A fine encapsulation of the &#8220;white privilege&#8221; ideology as translated into public school textbooks is this vivid description of the &#8220;bias and sensitivity&#8221; guidelines of one of the three textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill by renowned education historian Diane Ravitch:</p>
<p>&#8220;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &#8216;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &#8216;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&#8221;  (The Language Police, p. 44) </p>
<p>McGraw-Hill and the two other giant textbook publishers know how to sell textbooks to state schools systems.  No use putting a multi-million dollar sale to a large state in jeopardy by saying something nice about dead white males. It&rsquo;s not worth risking the wrath of some racial greivance group who might complain and kill the sale.<br>

		<p>As long as the white race continues to wimp out we get this kind of crap such as white privilege comments.  They continue to attack whites but the white folk seem to be professional victims at best.  Whites civilized the world and brought peace and health to cannibal tribes that died early of disease.  People of color still practice cannibalism in some areas.  Hawaii had cannibalism well past 1900.  Africa and some South pacific areas still have this problem.  We should have left them alone. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of all the whites flaunting their privilege. How dare they! They walk around so high and mighty thinking.. hmmm I&rsquo;ve still got it! </p>
<p>Well brothers its time for change. We need MORE affirmative action in fact if ANY black applies for a job they MUST be hired over all whites. And more farming reparations money. There are hundreds of millions of poor black farmers in America who need help and were discriminated against. Why just here in Manhattan we have over 500,000 farmers who need the money. We need at least another 500 billion dollars just to get started. </p>
<p>And in school its very important to cut every program for gifted children. All money must be spent so that no child is ever left behind. To do anything else reeks of white privilege. </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, the white population worldwide is reported to be between 9-12%, down from 30% in the early 1900s, yet our specialness continues to foment a privilege that other racial groups sense as a disadvantage to them.  </p>
<p>We are obviously a magical people!  And it seems that just as albinos are abused and killed for their magical properties in Africa, non-whites covet and seek to transfer that magical privilege to themselves by cannibalizing whites.  Africans run to Europe to have magic sex with Europeans.  In many places, they try to look more like us or otherwise join up by taking a white partner.  But all that seems to happen as our numbers dwindle is that our magic is increased and the call for taking the magic grows stronger.</p>
<p>My former paragraph may seem silly, but people are basically primitive, that is my point.  Superstition, envy, and laziness are prominent, primitive characteristics.  And Social Marxism makes good use of these and other base characteristics.</p>

<p>Just want to point out that being a &#8220;professional victim&#8221; means that they make money from victimhood as a rule.  This does not fit the rest of your comment, or the situation of whites.  It DOES fit the situation of some other groups, however. </p>

		<p>Thank God my parents saw fit to send me to a private church school (Protestant) where the students were all white, and the teachers saw fit to teach us that although God loves everyone, he didn&rsquo;t make us all the same. They made sure in little ways, without ever coming right out and saying so, that all of us knew that race-mixing was wrong. Dating (never mind marrying or having a child with) a non-white was right up there on the list of seven deadly sins, right along with premarital sex (they never did quite keep some of us from indulging in that particular sin!) and murder. These values were enforced and reinforced between home and school and church. </p>

		<p>I went down to the old White Privilege store again, just to check things out.  Yep, still boarded up.  It&rsquo;s been closed for many years now.  You can&rsquo;t order any white privilege online, either.  So, I&rsquo;m stumped. I just don&rsquo;t know where to get some white privilege, because it sure doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere that I can find.</p>

		<p>What I find REALLY disturbing is that this point of view (that white success MUST be the result of whites oppressing others, and those others of course must be &#8220;people of color&#8221; ) - is being embraced and taught by none other than the Roman Catholic Church.  It is also being espoused by the United Methodists and the Congregationalists.  I have a friend who has 4 adult kids.  One is married to a very successful entrepreneur, and my friend STILL calls all businesspeople thieves and bloodsuckers.  She won&rsquo;t listen to the fact that it&rsquo;s the businesspeople who provide others with jobs.  Nope, she believes what her Union Democrat father, and now the Church - teaches:  that successful whites have gotten their success by oppressing others, period end of report.  We don&rsquo;t have much of a friendship any more because I really don&rsquo;t want to have to hear that kind of talk.</p>

		<p>Our European ancestors were heroic. They played the game as it has been played since the first life forms appeared on Earth  &mdash;  you take, or you get taken from. They excelled at this game: they took the entire world. I feel enormous pride when I think of this. Of course, I feel sympathy for the losers too  &mdash;  the Native Americans, the enslaved Africans  &mdash;  but that doesn&rsquo;t change the basic fact: our ancestors were heroic. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white and I made somewhere in the low 40&rsquo;s last year, my modest home is about 1/3 paid off, I drive a ten year old compact, and I&rsquo;ve worked at jobs where I had to be on my absolute best behavior because some AA idiot was looking for any excuse to let go a white guy&hellip;..if someone could direct me to this &#8220;white privilege&#8221; that I have, I would be more than grateful.</p>
