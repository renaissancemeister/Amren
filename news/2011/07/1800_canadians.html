			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard J. Brennan, The Star, July 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney confirmed Wednesday that as many as 1,800 new Canadians could be stripped of their citizenship because they were obtained fraudulently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the process of notifying them that we will be revoking their citizenship because Canadian citizenship is not for sale,&#8221; Kenney told the Economic Club of Canada.</p>
<p>Kenney said some of the individuals are believed to have used &#8220;unscrupulous&#8221; immigration consultants who submitted fraudulent applications on behalf of people who did not meet the qualifications for citizenship.</p>
<p>The 1,800 were identified following a three-year investigation by the RCMP, other police forces and Citizenship and Immigration Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, we are not done with our investigation&#8221; Kenney said, noting that many of the accused live outside the country.</p>
<p>They can challenge the decision in Federal Court. If not, Cabinet will move to revoke their citizenship.</p>
<p>Citizenship revocation is relatively uncommon in Canada with only 63 people being stripped of their citizenship since 1977, Kenney said.</p>
<p>Most were for reasons related to residence fraud, criminality and false identity, or concealing their involvement in war crimes.</p>
<p>Speaking in Vancouver on Tuesday, Kenney said Ottawa is trying to discourage immigration fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who simply touch down and try to get a Canadian passport as a &hellip; passport of convenience, who don&rsquo;t pay our taxes but who do consume our social benefits, I think that&rsquo;s dishonourable,&#8221; he told reporters after delivering a speech to the Vancouver Board of Trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many ways that we are combating immigration fraud and abuse of our generosity, whether it is from [bogus] asylum claimants, crooked immigration consultants, people smugglers [or] people who are abusing our citizenship program,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kenney also announced that Canada will soon be introducing multi-year visas for low-risk visitors from around the world that will last 10 years.</p>

<p>Excellent point! But expelling just 1,800 of these fraudsters is just scraping the top of the barrel. Thousands and thousands more third worlders need to be thrown out of Canada.</p>

		<p>Well done Kenney!</p>
<p>Not before time !</p>
<p>Whenever there are outbreaks of fighting in Lebanon, hundreds - or thousands or even tens of thousands - of Lebanese who have managed to obtain Canadian citizenship, legitimately or otherwise, howl and squeal at the top of their voices to be &#8220;rescued&#8221; from their country of ethno-cultural origin at the expense of the hapless Canadian taxpayer.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Canada has long been regarded as a soft touch among Third Worlders, just like Australia and the Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>PLEASE PLEASE<br>
Check out the Mark Steyn site and the astounding story of La Famille Khadr.</p>
<p>A MINOR EXTRA POINT:  Anyone who can mumble ten words of French is welcomed with open arms by the government of Quebec; some - not all - Quebecois harbor so deeply and malevolent visceral hatred of Anglo-Canada that they would gladly admit any number of Francophone or semi-Francophone* Third Worlders just to spite Ottawa and Toronto.</p>
<p>* Try talking to a Haitian in normal French to see what I mean by the term semi-Francophone.</p>

<p>I am an Anglo-Canadian. Growing up we used to make fun of Quebecois and play into the rivalry, but not anymore. Now I love my Quebecois brothers. We have had our beef in the past but now our interests are alined &mdash; we are all Westerners, as we have been for millienia. As an Anglo-Canadian I am 1000 times closer to a Quebecois in terms of blood, history and culture than I am to so many others to whom we have granted the title &#8220;Canadian&#8221;. </p>
<p>I love Quebecois. Quebecois are my brothers. And we all need to stand up together to preserve our Civilization and resist the invasion.<br>

		<p>I wonder how many of these individual are American citizens.  Many American hop the border in search of more reasonable health care oppurtunities and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they were taking advantage of the Canadian healthcare system.</p>

<p> I live in Canada&hellip;ever trying talking to a Quebecois in normal French?  With the possible exception of the Haitians you mentioned Quebecois speak the worst French in the world.  I work with Rwandans and Moroccans and Senegalese and I can assure you they all speak better French than the Quebecois. A product of the French colonial schools I guess. I love my Quebec brothers but most third-world Francophones speak real French while in Quebec they speak what can only be called Quebecois.  When my dad (ethnically German) moved to Canada from France his boat stopped in Montreal and he did not know what the hell they were staying so he stayed on until Toronto.  As is typical of a well-educated European my dad is fluent in several languages.  He went to University Sorbonne in Paris. In France they assume he is a native-born Frenchman but in Montreal he could not understand the people.</p>
<p> I hate the mass immigration to Quebec but they usually speak French better than the locals.<br>
