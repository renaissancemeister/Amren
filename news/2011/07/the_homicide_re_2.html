		<p>I wonder how many of those 394 &#8220;white&#8221; murderers were actually Latino/Mestizo?  And the 3,452 total seems rather low for a 4 1/2 year period, probably because these numbers do not include &#8220;gang-related fatalities.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Census data claims blacks up up 8.7% of the population yet they comprise 32% of the murder victims? Hispanics aren&rsquo;t nearly so bad, 47% (probably more than that) of the population with 51% of the murder victims.</p>

		<p>Black homicide seems unsurprising given the experiences in other cities, but what&rsquo;s with the Latinos?  They weren&rsquo;t subjected to American slavery and centuries of humiliation.  Yet the rates are very high.  Maybe its income related, but poor whites and asians have low homicide rates.  Why the disparity?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you are being sarcastic, but poverty and crime are more often than not correlation rather than cause and effect.  And Black Americans living today were not subjected to slavery and centuries of humiliation.  In fact, their quality of life and opportunity are far superior to many other tribes around the world that demonstrate far greater restraint and respect for the rule of law.  </p>

If you want to see the level of minority crime in this country, try this game I call, &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221;.</p>
<p>Go to google and type, &#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; &#8220;Police Departmetn&#8221; &#8220;Name_of_City&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, try this search and see what you get:</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; &#8220;Police Department&#8221; Camden</p>
<p>and this one,</p>
<p>&#8220;Most Wanted&#8221; &#8220;Police Department&#8221; Buffalo New York</p>

The closer one is in number of generations to the paleolithic era the closer one is to an environment where men had to kill in order to live. Hispanics are a hybrid race composed of Caucasians and American Indians. Agriculture and urban living exert different population pressures than hunting and gathering. </p>

The whites in Los Angeles seem non-existent.<br>
According to the Nationalist Times, the last million whites relocated out of Southern California in 2000 for WA, OR, NV, AZ, and CO.<br>
They should be ashamed.</p>

		<p>#4 Anonymous - So the fact that some blacks&rsquo; ancestors were slaves 150 years ago is justification for their high murder rates? I&rsquo;ll be sure to pass that along to Channon&rsquo;s and Christopher&rsquo;s families. &#8220;Centuries of humiliation&#8221;? No one lives for centuries, no individual can be subjected to centuries of humiliation. Blacks NOW are given more privileges and handouts than any other group, at the expense of said other groups, especially Whites. </p>
<p>Frankly, ignorance has gotten so dominant that any discussion or even mention of slavery should always be prefaced with two facts:</p>
<p>1. Blacks were NOT the only ones who were ever enslaved.<br>
2. Whites were NOT the only ones who ever enslaved people.</p>
<p>People like you are not &#8220;part of the problem.&#8221; You ARE the problem.</p>

The evidence already exists. Studies in Iowa, Sweden, and Denmark have indicated that identical twins are more likely to be similar in criminal behavior than fraternal twins. These studies have also indicated a stronger correlation in adopted children between felony convictions among the biological parents and the biological children than between the adopted children and their adoptive parents.  <br>

     In the Soviet Union in 1959 scientists captured wild rats and divided them into two colonies. Rats in one colony were bred for tameness. Rats in the other colony were bred for ferocity. Currently the rats in the tame colony would make excellent pets. They love to be held and petted. The rats in the other colony hiss at the approach of a human. They violently resist being held. The environments for these rats are identical. The fact that tameness and ferocity can be influenced genetically has obvious implications for criminology. <br>

		<p>Real Latinos and Hispanics are of the European white caucasoid race not the red yellow mongoloid Asian race. </p>
<p>Why not start labeling races by their race only as archelogists have always labeled them with caucasoid mongoloid and negoid.</p>

		<p>How many times have we heard that LA is a conglomeration of every race on earth?  How much do you want to bet that every race but Blacks and Hispanics and Northern Asians was counted as White.  Some Turk goes nuts and kills 10 people - &#8220;White murders 10&#8221; in statistics.</p>

		<p>Something else which might be examined: how many of the blacks who commit these crimes had ancestors who were never enslaved? Say, they had come here as immigrants? Could one assume that immigrants from, say, Somalia, have the same murder rates as whites? </p>

		<p>Unwanted minorities will have their little turf wars to set up spheres of influence and they will go head to head, not with the richest but the poorest and least well represented amongst whom they fall naturally as a function of residential tax codes and the like.</p>
<p>Thus they magnify the effects of both their own innate violence and take a hit from any associated, high violence, population groups.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that &#8216;they all look the same to us&rsquo; is NOT a factor for these people.  A first generation Guatemalan will be looked down on as an invasive threat by a third generation Mexican, even if both are still technically illegals.</p>
<p>Make no mistake people: California is now Mexican Territory and Reconquista has nothing to do with equal opportunity or &#8216;the strengths of diversity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The poor will make niche`s for themselves and their own by feeding off of and then displacing those indigenous populations they feel they can compete with.  All the while eating out the roots of the support system by which the White Middle/Upper Classes feel secure until, rootless, the entire megalith topples.</p>

<p>They use cars to drive into &#8220;rich&#8221; areas   &mdash;   they know very well where the best loot is, and it ain&rsquo;t in poor communities.  That&rsquo;s why so many homes in California&rsquo;s &#8220;rich&#8221; areas have security systems, guard dogs, cameras and security fencing and so many new developments are built with safety in mind, as in behind 24 manned gates with 24 hour safety patrols.  </p>
<p>Many of California&rsquo;s &#8220;rich&#8221; hire dirt-poor gardeners and housekeepers, have gate codes and house keys and that&rsquo;s why many burglaries, residential robberies and home invasions have been tied back to these low paid, nonwhite employees.</p>
