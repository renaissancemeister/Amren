<h1><a href="https://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/21/hindu-diners-sue-indian-restaurant-for-selling-meat-samosas/">Hindu Diners Sue Indian Restaurant for Selling Meat Samosas</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Moni Basu and Chelsea Bailey, CNN Belief Blog, July 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A small tray of vegetable samosas costs $35 at the Mughal Express restaurant. But one particular tray, sold to strict Hindu vegetarians, might end up costing the Edison, New Jersey, restaurant a whole lot more.</p>
<p>The Hindu customers said the restaurant served them meat samosas, harming them emotionally and spirituality. {snip}</p>
<p>Two summers ago, Durgesh Gupta and Sharad Agrawal walked into the popular Mughal Express on Oak Tree Road, in the heart of Edison&rsquo;s Indian community, and ordered samosas. They were strict vegetarians, they said in making sure there was no meat in their order of the traditional Indian snack.</p>
<p>Gupta said a restaurant employee assured them that it did not make meat samosas, according to court documents. A half-hour later, the two men picked up a tray labeled &#8220;VEG samosas.&#8221;</p>
<p>But after Gupta and his group of 16 people began eating the triangular deep-fried pastries, they grew concerned they were eating meat. When they went to return the uneaten samosas, the restaurant said it had made a mistake, court documents showed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What the 16 Hindus want is compensation for a trip to the Hindu holy town of Haridwar, India, where the Ganges begins its downward flow to the ocean. There, they want to take dips in the river and, by Hindu belief, cleanse their souls of sin.</p>
<p>And they want the restaurant to pay for it all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2002, McDonald&rsquo;s Corp. paid $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian and other groups in order to settle a lawsuit against the company for failing to disclose that beef flavoring was used in French fries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pradip Kothari, president of the Indo-American Cultural Society in Edison, suggested the diners could easily go to a temple to cleanse their souls.</p>
<p>Indian-Americans have much to be grateful for in America, he said, and the lawsuit takes advantage of a U.S. judicial system that has afforded them individual protections.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He did not know the diners, he said, but they should be ashamed for bringing a bad name not just to Hindus but to the Indian-American community.</p>

		<p>As stupid as this lawsuit is - why can&rsquo;t they FedEx some Ganges water from India and they can cleanse their souls in Edison?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take these Hindus long to game the system. Maybe if they go back they can stay - then they cleanse themselves whenever a dinner doesn&rsquo;t measure up.</p>
<p>By the way, I had some tasteless pineapples at Applebees. Perhaps I should sue for a trip to Honolulu to cleanse my palate. </p>

		<p>Hindus have no business being in America. The founders of American intended America to be a Christian nation. If we keep on allowing our corrupt government to import more Hindus, pretty soon, it will be crime in the USA to eat beef or kill a cow like it is in India. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to live in Hindu India. I want to live in Christian America where we eat beef!</p>

		<p>Indians are aware of white people&rsquo;s gullibility.  </p>
<p>Guru&rsquo;s, Gypsys and Fakirs have been peddling Eastern mystical snakeoil to whites for centuries.  They&rsquo;ll take as much from us as we allow them to.</p>

		<p>This was big news in NJ last week.  Heathens complaining how they wouldn&rsquo;t go to &#8220;heaven&#8221; if they didn&rsquo;t get a free vacation to their homeland.  How swimming in a disease and dead-body filled river would cleanse anything let alone their souls I will never understand.  I am tired of kowtowing to bizarre cults that have no business even being allowed here.<br>

		<p>In this case I side with the diners (although the legal recompense I have no opinion on). That is, Mughal Express should not be selling something labeled as vegetarian with meat products in it. Especially to Indians as many Hindus and other Indian religious people (there is some religion, I forget the name, most have last name Shah, that won&rsquo;t even eat potatoes because there are live organisms living on them) have a religious reason for being vegetarian. <br>
That said this is no &#8220;Diversity&#8221; issue. Edison,NJ has become overwhelmingly Indian and the restaurant sounds like it is owned and run by if not Indians, &#8220;subcontinent&#8221; people. And that may be the real lesson here-Diversity is a difficult road to follow under the best of circumstances.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Cleanse&#8221;?  really? The soul is about the only thing you are gonna cleanse in the river Ganges, that river is the worlds biggest open sewer, contaminated with feces,residuals from open air cremations, etc, etc. you are more likely to get Giardia and a host of other parasites and bacterium than get you soul cleansed of sins. Priceless.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Religious freedom&#8221; needs to be re-defined, for the sake of common sense &amp; logic, things that seem to be little understood by those who follow these irrational ideologies.</p>
<p>Or else&hellip;very soon we might be hearing in a court that it was a Muslim&rsquo;s &#8220;religious right&#8221; to stone or beat his wife/daughter for daring to disobey him &amp; think for herself. </p>
<p>Presumably, they stopped eating when they discovered it was meat. An apology was sufficient, imo, because no physical harm was done &amp; it was a genuine mistake. &#8220;Spiritual harm&#8221; is something that cannot be proved &amp; is subjective, so should not have any weight when considering legal complaints. Unless, of course, there is a precedent for meat causing psychological harm&hellip;</p>

<p>At that price they better be good samosas.  Seriously though, I agree that some kind of compensation is due  &mdash;  basic contract.  That being said, a pilgrimage is excessive.</p>

<p>All that this restaurant owes these buffoonish whiners is a $35 refund and an apology for getting their order wrong. </p>
<p>And if these ultra-religious Hindoostani complainants were actually assimilable to the American way of life, that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;d be asking for. </p>
<p>When blacks try to pull some grievance-based get-rich-quick scheme like this, we call it &#8220;The Ghetto Lottery.&#8221; What then to call this new brand of scamming from the subcontinent? &#8220;The Slumdog Lottery&#8221;?</p>

If you ask for vegetarian for any reason and they serve you meat  you have a right to compensation. But not a free trip to India. Refund the value of the meal, and a few dollars extra ought to be good enough.</p>

<p>  You would think that the Hindi would insist that the Holy River Ganges/Ganga be made unpolluted and crystal clear, rather than the smelly, open sewer it has become. Is that really respecting its holy status? However, no one ever said that religious had to make sense.  </p>

		<p>Hindu Indians did everything possible to get rid of white people from India. Now, it seems Hindus want to invade the nations of the white race via immigration. As a white man, could I immigrate to India? NO, but Hindus can immigrate to my country. There is something wrong with this scenario. We whites are being taken advantage of by Hindus.</p>

<p>The poster named &#8220;Sureesh&#8221;   &mdash;   who is usually chomping at the bit to remind us troglodyte Americans how much smarter and harder-working Indians like him are compared to stupid, lazy caucasians like us   &mdash;   is strangely silent on this issue. </p>
<p>Might this be because when people demand transcontinental vacations worth thousands of dollars to compensate for a bungled $35 plate of pastries, well, it doesn&rsquo;t make those people sound too intelligent, now does it? </p>
<p>No doubt I&rsquo;m just one of those stupid lazy white people, but claiming that you need to &#8220;cleanse&#8221; yourself in one of the world&rsquo;s filthiest bodies of water also doesn&rsquo;t sound too intelligent to me. </p>

		<p>I never said all Indians were perfect but if you look at the statistics, Indians do pretty darn well in the U.S. in terms of both obeying the law and paying taxes. If you look at the grand scheme of things, I bet you there are FAR fewer Indians per capita who pursue frivolous lawsuits than whites per capita. This is an isolated incident.</p>
<p>Besides, when it comes down to it, we are non violent and productive and that&rsquo;s what matters. You have nothing to fear from us. In fact, a white school teacher, in the posting about the achievement gap,even said she prefers teaching Indian kids to white kids because Indian kids are well behaved and smart and make her job easier. </p>

		<p>Uh, Sureesh&hellip;.no word on the track record of Indians for ruining businesses in the US, or their penchant for fake degrees, or their reputation for shady &amp; dishonest business practices&hellip;?</p>
<p>And why do Indians always, like some Africans, insist on using exceptions &amp; insulting entire races in order to boast of their achievements &amp; make themselves feel better?</p>
<p>Yes, Indians are specifically taught &amp; trained that their better than EVERYONE, so make the effort to excel. They&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t the only ones. And remember, many Anglo-Americans have equal talent, they&rsquo;re just possibly discriminated against (by the very same policies that portray Indians in such a awesome fashion &amp; give them such exaggerated exposure) &amp; they&rsquo;re targeted by the elite to fail because the destruction of America is currently a priority.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think solitary examples prove that Indians are somehow coveted by indigenous Americans because they think their own kids are useless. You seriously think they think so little of their own?</p>
<p>And btw, Persians are another minority group that has done well in the US. As are Japanese&hellip;</p>
<p>And can Anglo Americans or Europeans in general move to India to show their population how intelligent &amp; creative they are? I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be able to improve the life of the majority of poverty-struck Indians more so than their own gov&rsquo;t has. </p>
<p>Oh, but you might call that &#8220;colonisation&#8221;, wouldn&rsquo;t you? </p>
<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m not saying that Indians aren&rsquo;t smart, but why don&rsquo;t they stay in their own nation &amp; lend their intelligence to assist their own people? Why do you feel the need to establish it in nations that aren&rsquo;t yours, &amp; weren&rsquo;t developed by you? </p>
<p>Western nations aren&rsquo;t under any obligation to promote any talent besides their own. </p>

		<p>If Sureesh thinks Hindus are so great, why do Hindus keep on immigrating to White nations? Why can&rsquo;t Hindus make India great? Hindu India is a third-world country that continues to send millions of Hindus to white nations like Great Britain and America.</p>
<p>Without the white man and his willingness to allow foreigners into his nations, Hindus would be forced to live in their own corrupt third-world nation called India.</p>
