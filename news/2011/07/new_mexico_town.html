<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The scandal-plagued, tiny New Mexico border town of Columbus is dissolving its police department and asking the county sheriff to protect its citizens.</p>
<p>{snip} The Luna County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office will now take over patrolling the town.</p>
<p>The town has been upended since federal authorities arrested Police Chief Angelo Vega, Mayor Eddie Espinoza, Village Trustee Blas Gutierrez and nine other residents for conspiring to smuggle hundreds of guns to drug cartels over the border in March. All of the accused have pleaded not guilty, and their trial is expected in October, according to the Las Cruces Sun News. (You can read the indictment <a href="/Documents/ColumbusIndictments.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The Associated Press presciently reported in May of 2009 that a law enforcement &#8220;vacuum&#8221; had made the town attractive to drug smugglers who moved over the border to settle down in Columbus. The &#8220;four-man police force in Columbus has turned over seven times in three years because of scandal or apathy,&#8221; the AP reported, adding that more residents of the formerly modest town were driving flashy cars and buying fancy homes. Vega, who had then just nabbed the police chief job, told the AP that no illegal activity would be tolerated. &#8220;This is a new day for Columbus,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Me-hico is blaming the USA and the Gringos for all of the guns going into Me-hico.This incident points to the fact that most of those guns are being sent there by members of La Raza,the Master Race of Me-hico.</p>

		<p>America should end the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; which has been a colossal failure for everyone but the DEA. Its budget has increased 4000% in the past forty years. That&rsquo;s right - 4000%.</p>

		<p>In Latin America our governments always are looking for a scapegoat to blame for the chronic violence of our people, to avoid the hard true, that our countries are overwhelmed by criminals and that the civil society not only is incapable of stopping them but also some times protect them.</p>
<p>In our countries the tolerance towards criminals is a way for the elites (mostly leftists) to keep the countries in control, they started in the independence wars.</p>
