			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS (Minnesota), July 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police say a man robbed a Minneapolis bank with the hopes of being caught.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A bank employee said the robber, Hassan Muse Farah, had walked through the front entrance and gave one of the tellers a threatening hand written note.</p>
<p>The teller gave him money from the register. Then Farah, 20, walked over to a chair in the business lobby and sat down to wait until police arrived and he was arrested.</p>
<p>Police said Farah waived his Miranda rights, admitted to robbing the bank, and has been charged with second degree aggravated robbery.</p>
<p>They say he robbed the bank and waited for them to arrive just so he could be sent to prison or deported.</p>

		<p>As an old Africa hand you get quite adept at identifying the various tribes, this on is from the horn, most likely Somali.<br>
I guess he wants to join the revolution and does not have plane fare back home. Silly kid, all he has to do is go to the mosque, they&rsquo;ve got a ticket waiting for him.</p>

		<p>Not the brightest bulb in the pack is he? Did he ever think that if he did get away, he would have money to do his thing without having the police help him do it. Why didn`t he try to succeed rather than just just wait for the downfall? Kind of reminds me of those LA shootout robbers. You have a car, a machine gun and a bullet proof vest&hellip; Yet you just stand there and trade fire with half a city instead of trying to break thru their cordon to freedom. I just don`t get it&hellip;</p>

		<p>just as we have laws where new mothers can drop off their newborn infants at any firehouse or hospital with out consequences, we should have a program where any blak person can walk into any aitport in america, surrender their passport, and get free passage to any african country they chose. these poor victims should not be forced into committing crimes just to go back to their homeland</p>

		<p>Damn, Hassan, you didn&rsquo;t have to do that. There are plenty of Americans who are more than willing to chip in to buy Africans a one-way ticket home.</p>

		<p>This is a sad testament to the state of our country; illegals are fleeing from America to Africa, for God&rsquo;s sake! </p>

		<p>Yup, Somali. Yup, not the brightest bulb (they were without an alphabet little more than a hundred years ago).</p>
<p>And yup. Our version of &#8216;Minne-diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Please, DO SEND THEM BACK. Let them REBUILD SOMALIA in glorious splendor, after the lessons LSS has taught them.</p>
<p>Let them be a &#8216;blessing&rsquo;&hellip;. to SOMEBODY ELSE!</p>

<p>One gets the impression you would just love them more if they were smart robbers. You are part of the problem Tim. Crime is crime and bad is bad irrespective of if it is done smartly or otherwise. The key here is morality first. Attitude  not aptitude. </p>

<p>It was even more recent, 1972!!! Somali has had an alphabet for less than 40 years!  And they expect them to &#8220;assimilate&#8221;?</p>
