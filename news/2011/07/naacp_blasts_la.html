			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Andersen, Wall Street Journal, July 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a press release issued this morning, the NAACP condemned 24-hour cable news channel CNN for its recently announced prime time news lineup, calling the lack of diversity in its collection of news anchors a &#8220;glaring omission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The NAACP is deeply concerned with the lack of African American journalists in prime time news, both on cable and national news shows,&#8221; NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous said in the statement. &#8220;We have come to expect this from the likes of Fox News, but not other networks. While we understand that news is now a 24-hour cycle, most Americans get their news from the morning and evening prime time broadcasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new CNN news lineup, which was announced yesterday, features John King, Anderson Cooper, Erin Burnett and Piers Morgan.</p>

		<p>Why are they complaining? A line up like that will make even BET an attractive alternative for most viewers.  It&rsquo;s a ratings gift.</p>
<p><br>
CNN failed to come out with a counter punch: &#8220;We deplore the NAACP&rsquo;s refusal to tell us which of our White anchors they want fired for racial reasons, or to recommend a replacement.  Until then, we can&rsquo;t even understand why they are drawing any attention to themselves.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The new CNN (prime time) lineup, which was announced yesterday, features John King, Anderson Cooper, Erin Burnett and Piers Morgan.&#8221;<br>
And the rest of the time CNN features people like Fredrica Whitfield and that Afro-centric liberal Don Lemon who can&rsquo;t stop doing segments about blacks when he&rsquo;s on the air. That network lacks whites most of the time, not blacks. </p>

		<p>Twelve-point-five percent. African Americans are just 12.5% of the population. So, what&rsquo;s the problem? Does Benjamin Todd Jealous wants the proportion of blacks on TV news to correspond to their share of the nation&rsquo;s criminal population?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to come full circle on quotas. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s do it. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give each slice of the population jobs in every profession in exact proportion to their representation in the broader population. </p>
<p>You want African Americans in TV news? Fine, 12.5%   &mdash;   no more, no less   &mdash;   is just fine with me. </p>
<p>Would you be willing to accept the same proportion in local, state, and federal government agencies? It would mean an awful lot of pink slips. </p>

		<p>CNN? Did I read that right? I used to call it the Communist News Network, now I call it the Colored News Network. All those specials on our poor people of oolor, that mulatto that talks about (colored) education and how to raise test scores and fix the public schools. Haiti and how they still haven&rsquo;t recovered from the earthquake, blah, blah, blah. on and on and on.  </p>

		<p>The trouble is that white people are pretty much the only people who watch news shows.  Any blacks or latinos who watch it are activists looking for some hint of &#8216;racism&rsquo; that they can protest about and profit from.</p>
<p>I personally will not watch a news show with a black anchor.  Not because I&rsquo;m &#8216;inherently&rsquo; racist, but because I need someone who looks like me to help me understand the news.  Isn&rsquo;t that what black education reformers say that black students need, because those who look like them can reach the students better?  Well, it goes in other areas of life also.</p>
<p>The local CBS affiliate newstalk radio station had a black news reader about ten months ago.  When I heard him for the first time, because I listen to a lot of talk radio, it was so jarring that I had to turn the station to another newstalk show.  The deep african tones in his voice didn&rsquo;t sound like someone I would trust.  He was gone after about three weeks.  The station, in this liberal city, learned its lesson.  </p>
<p>CNN and other networks, even though they are mostly liberal, also know this truth.  The most they can get away with are Asian or latina females (not males.)  Because white men don&rsquo;t feel threatened by them and may like to look at them.</p>

Same thing goes on in the military, also disgusting and the military meticulously covers up black male on White woman rapes.</p>

		<p>As SF Paul has implied, only in the modern world (&#8220;giant open air insane asylum&#8221; as anon 10 put it), do we have MSM editors across the board breaking their necks to remove black people as the subject of news stories, while the NAACP is supposedly expending the same amount of energy to get blacks put in front of the news.<br>
We really are living in strange &#8220;opposite world&#8221; times, it&rsquo;s no wonder that so many people are on antidepressants these days.</p>

		<p>CNN is a money-making business.  If a black primetime lineup would make more money, they&rsquo;d have one in a NY minute.  Eliot Spitzer was recently fired, and CNN had every opportunity to hire a black and didn&rsquo;t.  The only time blacks appear as anchors are in throwaway slots in midmorning and on weekends.  <br>
The NAACP has become like a bunch of field slaves grumbling about massa while they pick cotton.  Massa knows they&rsquo;re griping and doesn&rsquo;t care.  <br>
GreatNorthWoods #9  &mdash;  I don&rsquo;t mean to sound picky, but please don&rsquo;t give American blacks any edge in their percentages.  Guilty Liberal #5 is correct; they&rsquo;re around 12.5%, not 14%.  Surveys have shown some people believe they comprise anywhere from 30% to 50%.  Yet their population percentage has not grown even one full point since the Civil War!  <br>

<p>I particularly liked this revealing line:<br>

		<p>Its been almost 15 years since I stopped watching TV, and the #1 reason I quit and refuse to go back - is the anti-white, relentless white guilt brainwashing, and  the not so subtle, vitriolic torrent of hatred for Whites that literally gushes out of every program on every network.  </p>
<p>Combine that with the massive numbers of blacks and other non-whites that are being shoved in our faces - and most of these minorities are cast in roles such as Pulitzer Prize winning brain surgeons, Nuclear Scientists, Electrical Engineers, Astronauts and assorted other occupations that are totally unrealistic for a demographic group of people who&rsquo;s average IQ is between 85-87 - and its pretty obvious that these anti-white media owners are deliberately trying to miss-characterize blacks in particular, as part of their diabolically evil white genocide scheme to get our white daughters to breed with them, because - according to what their TV tells them, blacks are just like whites except for a different paint job.   </p>
<p>Advice to all white nationalists and white racial realists:  Kill your TV and DO NOT allow one of these brainwashing devices anywhere near your children.   Unless you want a mulatto grandchild to appear in your future, and look forward to celebrating the death of your genetic lineage.<br>

		<p>I recently saw some shows on the Disney Channel (which is for kids).  I was at a person&rsquo;s house and the various kids there were watching it.  I don&rsquo;t have cable (by choice) so it&rsquo;s been awhile since I really saw much TV.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, this channel was dripping with so much diversity and mixed race relationships that it was unreal.  Can I repeat that last word again?  </p>
<p>Besides pushing dating to the tween set in a way I never imagined any network would, every show had multiple mixed race romantic couples and deep friendships.  Even more than that, nearly every show had a black kid as the lead character or as one or more of the main leads.</p>
<p>I felt like I was watching BET TV!</p>
<p>This one show called Ant Farm, about a gifted and talented 12 year old black girl who is being promoted to high school because she&rsquo;s so smart - omg it was a trip of unreality!  In the segment I saw, she was singing and playing guitar for a crowd of mostly white teenagers who were cheering and admiring her as if she were a top 40 diva.</p>
<p>Just to mention it, there&rsquo;s a new commercial for the Gerber College Savings plan.  It has four white women sitting with a married black couple and assorted kids all around.  It looks like a typical suburban housewife, playdate get-together.  </p>
<p>The white woman wonders aloud how she is going to pay for college for her little girl.  Well, cue the black couple, who proceed to explain how they researched and settled on the Gerber plan for their daughter&rsquo;s college.  The stupified white woman take turns asking questions that betray both how ignorant they are and how amazed they are by the intelligence of the black couple.  I&rsquo;ve also noticed a lot of pharamacy commercials with Indian and Asian pharmacists in the lead.  Blacks as doctors in commercials is a given.</p>
<p>TV presents life as if it were a black world, and that whites are clueless and in need of the wisdom of blacks and other non-whites to survive.  White men, of course, are presented as the most helpless of all.</p>

<p>Actually in real life there was a young Black girl who was granted permission to the University of Connceticut. It was on NBC Nightly News last week. She speaks three langauges, plays the flute, has wickedly high SAT scores and was impreesive on virtually every level.</p>
<p>Occasionally, these type of situations do occur, no matter how rare.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve watched CNN before, and every program seems to have at least one black somewhere in the show.  They usually aren&rsquo;t anchors, but they often have a black weatherman or commentator or whatever.  Blacks only make up 12% of our population so I think they are fairly represented on CNN.</p>
<p>To #22 (Anonymous) - I find myself watching the Disney Channel alot with my sister.  And I agree, every main character seems to have a black as his/her best friend.  Although I will admit there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much mixed-race dating on the Disney Channel.  Black characters usually go for other blacks and whites usually go for other whites.</p>
