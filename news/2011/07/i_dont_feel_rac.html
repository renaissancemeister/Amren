			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), July 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the average cost of a four-year bachelor&rsquo;s degree exceeding $100,000 in the U.S., college scholarships are in high demand.</p>
<p>So when Marcus Carter presented a $500 grant to Brendan Baird on Thursday to help him offset the cost, he couldn&rsquo;t understand the controversy.</p>
<p>Carter, an African-American, is the vice-president of the Former Majority Association for Equality  &mdash;  a group that awards scholarships solely to white men.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of whites enrolled in college doubles the sum of all minorities. </p>
<p>But Carter, 27, says critics fail to understand awarding scholarships to anyone, regardless of their race or ethnicity, is beneficial to everyone.</p>
<p>He told WFAA.com: &#8216;I can&rsquo;t really say I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from, being only 27-years-old, I don&rsquo;t feel racially oppressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Just because you don&rsquo;t benefit directly doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t beneficial,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army veteran said he joined the organisation while serving in Iraq with FMAFE founder Colby Bohannan.</p>
<p>Bohannan explained he was motivated to start the college fund after feeling ostracised by other racially-exclusive grants offered to non-whites.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It just got really frustrating when every other scholarship you happen to find online you need not apply to based on your ethnicity or gender.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bohannan told the website the nine-member board of directors includes a Hispanic man and two women. All nine members work on a volunteer basis.</p>
<p>He said FMAFE, which was granted 501(c)3 status this month, has received $18,000 in donations.</p>
<p>Baird&rsquo;s is one of five grants the FMAFE is handing out across the U.S., after narrowing down the winners from 180 applicants.</p>
<p>Other scholarships will be awarded to college students in Long Beach, California; Columbus, Ohio and Miami Beach, Florida over the next week.</p>
<p>Baird said he was thankful for the financial help.</p>
<p>&#8216;If somebody else wants to go give it to the Martians of Outer Space, that&rsquo;s okay,&rsquo; he told WFAA.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&rsquo;t have any qualms with that. If these guys have decided they want to do it here and see that as an important cause, I&rsquo;m more than willing to say &#8220;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll take it&#8221; because they speak the biggest colour, which is green,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Carter echoed his sentiment, and is satisfied in his role offering financial aide to anyone in need.</p>
<p>&#8216;I go to sleep knowing that I am doing something good for society. I&rsquo;m being a productive member of society in my own heart,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Offering scholarships to specific racial and ethnic groups, including whites, is nothing new.</p>
<p>There are categories for African-Americans, asians, hispanics and for numerous other special interests on websites such as scholarships.com and fastweb.com.</p>

<p><br>
It&rsquo;s not? Care to cite precedent of even ONE scholarship available to whites only? Because I certainly can&rsquo;t remember hearing of any such thing ever before. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even convinced a whites-only scholarship would be deemed legal. <br>

		<p>A terrific thing to do, hope it catches on. This story reminds me of a news item from about fifteen years ago. A white heiress had died and in her will was a clause stating that her wealth should be used for a white only college fund. The law firm that handled the money in her name decided that her last wish was &#8221; socially irresponsible&#8221; and handed the money over to the local state government for an ethnics only college fund instead.</p>

		<p>I say, &#8220;Bravo&#8221;, to Mr. Carter.  As someone who is half black, it is very clear to me that if anyone is being &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against or is a victim  &mdash;  -with no recourse  &mdash;  -of &#8220;racism&#8221;, in this day and age, it is clearly (and dare I say it), almost exclusively, Whites.  </p>
<p>It is rather a nuisance that, almost without exception, when the term &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;racism&#8221; is used in conversation or court of law, it is tacitly assumed that the purveyor is always White; the &#8220;victim&#8221;, always a non-white.  Similarly, with respect to the Doctrine of Diversity, the objective is clearly:  Fewer Whites at any cost; more non-Whites, at whatever the cost.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest:  it is the White race, generally speaking, which has freely given the entire world technology, advanced communication, improved living conditions, improved healthcare, and altruism for other races and cultures.  This is something that is simply NOT found to any extensive degree among Blacks, Asians, or Hispanics, taken collectively.</p>
<p>If anything is unfortunate about this article, it is that this is so uncommon, that it is newsworthy.  Considering all the advantages and privileges Whites have freely given to everyone else  &mdash;  -and frequently, to their own detriment at that  &mdash;    &mdash;  why shouldn&rsquo;t someone Black freely give to an organization that will benefit Whites, exclusively???  </p>
<p>To those non-whites of whatever stripe who still imagine that they are oppressed, I say:  Get over it.  You&rsquo;re whining about nothing.  Take responsiblity for yourself.  No one owes you anything.  </p>

		<p>Oh, Black Man - save me! As if I needed you to lend a helping hand! This may be totally &#8220;off the wall&#8221; but I couldn&rsquo;t help sharing this &#8220;thing&#8221; from my friend:<br>
I was listening to Rush Limbaugh today (for as long as I could stand it) and I came up with this thought - &#8220;Do people love to hate you or do they hate to love you?&#8221; There is a big difference. I have lost my faith in many of the &#8220;conservative&#8221; commentators; <br>
Sean Hannity: Apart from his annoying habit of using the word &#8220;NOW&#8221; as much as a teenage girl uses the word &#8220;LIKE&#8221;, I recall listening to his radio program a few years ago when Mark Somers (Food Network - Unwrapped, producer of many programs) called in and Sean just went off on him in a very disgusting way. Ever since then I have viewed him as a stuck up little tight wad that couldn&rsquo;t fight his way out of a paper bag. <br>
Glen Beck: He&rsquo;s a crying, whiny, &#8220;let me preach to you&#8221; even though I don&rsquo;t know a damn thing about Theology&#8221; talking head! He showed his true colors way back when Anna Nicole Smith died. I will never forget it - I told my wife to sit and watch him one day. I told her this guy knows what he is talking about. He then goes on to talk about how much of a &#8220;slut&#8221; Anna Nicole Smith was. She may have been - but that turned her off and she left the room! I agreed with her. Why step on a dead woman and call her a slut?<br>
Rush Limbaugh: This guy strokes himself so much you have to wear a raincoat when you listen to his show! It&rsquo;s disgusting and annoying! I could give example after example - but I&rsquo;m not going to give him the credit!<br>
Do I think these guys are on the right side of history? Yes! Do I think these guys have a finger on the pulse of what&rsquo;s going on in our society? Yes! <br>
The problem is this; the messenger is an &#8220;A&#8221; Hole and no matter how you spice it - the product coming out of an &#8220;A&#8221; Hole will always taste like crap!<br>
My point; there are people out there who you disagree with but you still think they are a &#8220;decent person!&#8221; Therefore - you &#8220;Hate to Love Them.&#8221;<br>
People like Limbaugh, Hannity, and Beck are so despised by the left that they &#8220;Love to Hate Them!&#8221;<br>
We will never win over the left; they will never be convinced that they are so wrong! However, we can at least take the high road and reveal our arguments in a civil and constructive way!<br>

		<p>I have to tell you, I&rsquo;m not an angry guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen and experienced black criminality and violent, naked,  anti-White race hatred from them my whole life.  It was simply part and parcel of my life experience.  We stayed out of black areas way back when because even as kids we knew that if you ventured into a black neighborhood at the wrong time, more than likely you would be set upon, robbed, and beaten by a roving or random pack of black cowards.</p>
<p>A flash mob, if you will.  Maybe there were no cell phones and the numbers were fewer, but a flash mob is what they were even back then.</p>
<p>It seems, though, that the sheer volume and frequency of these savage attacks is at an all time high.  Every time I read or hear of one my rage grows.</p>
<p>The frequency has become so great that it is making headway into the consciousness of White people who do not think normally think in &#8220;White&#8221; terms. But among Whites who have lived and worked with black people, their rage grows, too. Of that I am certain.</p>
<p>If it reaches middle American Whites in that way, that will be a good thing.  I think, though, that before that happens some Whites somewhere, sometime soon will either respond violently with weapons or worse become a flash mob themselves.  I sure hope not.</p>
<p>You know what would happen then.  </p>

		<p>In the memory of my late grandmother I wanted to donate X$, preferably in the form of a scholarship. Incidentally around that time, a few months ago, I came across this org and I thought it&rsquo;s not  a bad idea. I donated a part of the money I allocated for donation to this group. I even wrote them a letter asking why isn&rsquo;t the criteria 100% White as opposed to current 25%, as the purpose of their existence won&rsquo;t be well served.</p>
<p>As expected I never got a response for my specific question about the eligibility criteria. I am South-Asian btw. I don&rsquo;t think all non-whites dislike whites or wish them bad, among non-black/brown populations from the Americas especially. At the same time I don&rsquo;t have a true picture in terms of statistics so I won&rsquo;t make any assumptions. </p>
<p>I also believe Whites should be a majority in their countries. Then again the only things constant is &#8216;change&rsquo; and countries do change over time, not necessarily in ways we like always !</p>

		<p>I believe a child is a good example.</p>
<p>When a child realizes that he/she can get away with certain things she or she acts out more and starts to show their own true nature without fear of retaliation. Under a strict parent this doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>That is why under a racist government Africans never had as high of crime or out of wedlock, etc.</p>
<p>Consequence and fear of retaliation isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. One reason I believe Caucasians can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t do certain things is because they can&rsquo;t get away with it. The same is not for other groups. Laws keep people in check. When people start turning a blind eye to certain groups out of the fear of racism that is when real problems start to arise.</p>
<p>As Africans realize that they can get away with it (thanks to Leftist) without fear of retaliation the trend will continue and probably get worse.</p>

		<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to see more and more minorities coming to the aid of white people before the total collapse of the U.S. takes place. A small number of them are starting to realize that they&rsquo;re killing the goose that laid the golden egg. They know what a hell-hole the U.S. will become if the white man is displaced. They&rsquo;ve seen what happened to Zimbabwe and what&rsquo;s happening in South Africa and are having second thoughts about ridding the world of whites. It&rsquo;ll be too little too late as Americas and Europe&rsquo;s fate is sealed. Collapse is inevitable. Out of the ashes will come an invigorated white race with one goal in mind, regaining our lost living space.</p>

		<p>Sureesh,</p>
<p>I can hear your craving to be White. With all due respect, I&rsquo;ll have to say seem to lack self-confidence &amp; have an aggrandized perception of yourself and the group you represent. From your name, my guess is you are likely to be a South-Indian. From my own observations, large masses of Indians seem to have a very servile attitude, lack confidence,are prone to fraud/cheating in one form or another, especially the Shudra and Dalit castes from southern India.</p>
<p>You are the Indian version of fantasized Whites who would either try to act or want to be  though they aren&rsquo;t. I have also seen you pit yourself against blacks claiming you and your ilk to be &#8216;victims because of being smart&rsquo; and what not. Nothing could be farther from truth. Indians are weak, that&rsquo;s what makes you a victim. While Indians don&rsquo;t behave like Blacks lot of Indians do have Black blood in them. Everyone knows the average intelligence of Indians so the &#8216;smart&rsquo; part really doesn&rsquo;t fly unless you meant &#8216;smarter than Blacks&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I am an Indian, btw.</p>

		<p>Well said X Man. As an Indian I can attest to the fact that India is a land of extremes, where you find the smartest &amp; dumbest people on Earth. Also, I was almost taken aback by some Indian posters here on Amren such as Sureesh &amp; Rjp who seem to grovel &amp; needlessly praise their affinity towards the white majority. One must be proud of their own race &amp; ethnicity. Yes, we have our good &amp; bad points just as whites &amp; other races do. Instead of trying to pass off as white, Sureesh should be proud of his Indian ethnicity &amp; work towards being a better citizen. True nationalism is NOT about debasing others but promoting one&rsquo;s self interest. Personally, I have no problems with any race. I just despise criminals, trouble makers &amp; parasites - race, gender, ethnicity, caste, nationality, creed - No Bar! </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised there are so many Indians on this forum. Doesn&rsquo;t it bother you guys that this forum, like the WN movement in general, is devoted to either kicking you out of the country or starting a new country without you-specifically to get away from you and anyone who &#8220;looks&#8221; like you?</p>
<p>BTW-In my experience, only liberals can&rsquo;t tell the difference between skin color and race. Race realists are the most educated about race.</p>

		<p>To Poster #16:</p>
<p>1. As an American (Indian American) I have the freewill to comment on any article &amp; on any forum, so long as I follow the forum guidelines. In a free &amp; democratic society - we call that freedom of expression &amp; association which btw, many white Americans do when they comment on Indian forums. Besides, Amren does allow non whites to comment.</p>
<p>2. I could honestly care less about this supposed agenda to &#8220;kick&#8221; non white ethnics out of the United States, because it is something not rooted in reality. It is essentially tantamount to stating that Elvis - King of Rock n Roll will crack out a new album live on stage (unplugged) in 2012. When I can confidently know that such a thought is simply preposterour, simply because &#8220;The King&#8221; is long dead!</p>

		<p>Asian Indians only make up 1 percent of the U.S. population but we are a brainy and conservative bunch. We are intrigued by Blacks and Liberals using the &#8220;color excuse&#8221; to explain  Black crime and underachievement because a lot of us have dark skin and are highly successful in America. Unlike East Asians (Chinese, Japanese), many dark skinned Indians get mistaken for Black upon glance. Thus proving it&rsquo;s not skin color holding Blacks back.</p>

<p>So, is it because only WN&rsquo;s seem to talk about black dysfunction? <br>
Or, do you fear that the average American can&rsquo;t tell the difference between blacks and Indians, so: as perception of blacks go, so goes the reputation of Indians! (I don&rsquo;t find this to be the case at all) And this forum is your way of keeping your finger on the pulse of white racial attitudes.</p>

<p>Why do you think somebody should be &#8216;worried&rsquo; about commenting on this forum ? Do you want us to go on a guilt or shame trip ? Sorry to disappoint you. That won&rsquo;t happen. Does it turnoff people ? Sure it does, once a threshold is reached.</p>
<p>You know I have always wondered, when I think about whiners, that if you don&rsquo;t like something don&rsquo;t do it. To put this in the context, if you don&rsquo;t want non-whites in your countries or even in your forums, close the door ! That simple, isn&rsquo;t it ?</p>
<p>I have always said the same to Indians who whine[d] about White rule or Muslim rule in India - if you didn&rsquo;t want it you shouldn&rsquo;t have had it! Again, that simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to say this again though, Whites&rsquo; disgust of non-whites is simply unparalleled in history. Every group likes to live with their own largely but no other group hates those who aren&rsquo;t like them like Whites do. All this while penetrating deep into the other group&rsquo;s lands. Today the same fate befalls them and they cry foul, funny.</p>
<p>Just be reminded that India was one of the few places in the ancient world which took Jews in and didn&rsquo;t persecute them like the &#8216;civilized&rsquo; west did. Whites couldn&rsquo;t live with a variant of their own kind!</p>
