He has also heralded himself as a champion of the poor.</p><p>As part of his plans to redistribute wealth, Malema has been calling on the ANC to nationalise the mines and introduce land expropriation without compensation.</p><p>The furore over his new house has prompted a number of opposition parties to ask the South African Revenue Services to investigate how he could afford his luxury home and cars and if he was paying tax.</p><p>At a press conference he called in Johannesburg on Wednesday, Malema denied building an expensive house and owning a Mercedes Benz C63, insisting instead he was poor.</p><p>When asked to explain how he could be poor when he had such possessions, he replied: &#8220;Because my definition of rich is those who own the means of production, I do not own . . . &#8221;</p><p>He added: &#8220;That house you always make noise about in Sandton is owned by Absa [bank]&#8220;.</p><p>When pressed further about his extravagant lifestyle, he refused to elaborate, saying his personal affairs, salary and business interests were &#8220;none of anybody&rsquo;s business&#8221; because he was not a public representative.</p><p>&#8220;A house costing R16-million [€1.62 million] to construct only exists in the imaginations of right- wing, narrow-minded and obsessed white people, who always think Africans cannot and should not build houses of their own.&#8221;</p><p>When asked how he justified his lavish lifestyle to those he claimed to represent, he said his supporters did not care about his wealth. &#8220;Our people don&rsquo;t care about our money. What they care about is political consciousness, the will to liberate them . . . Our people want the political will and the ability to act and that is what we are doing.&#8221;</p><p>He added: &#8220;One of the things I have learned in my short life in politics is the ability to live in the conditions of capitalism while fighting it and defeating it. I don&rsquo;t exploit people.&#8221;</p><p>Malema boasted that he was the only ANC leader who could go into any informal settlement in the country, an outburst that observers say is a swipe at South African president Jacob Zuma.</p><p>He has always had a difficult relationship with the South African media. In yesterday&rsquo;s daily Times newspaper, an editorial called him the true face of a 21st- century post-apartheid revolutionary.</p><p>&#8220;In post-apartheid South Africa, revolutionaries have transformed themselves. Now they use the language of liberation, and lyrics from struggle songs, to mask an acquisitive nature that revels in conspicuous consumption,&#8221; the paper said.</p><!-- #bbinclude "footer.incl" -->
