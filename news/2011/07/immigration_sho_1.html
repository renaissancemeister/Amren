<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lord Glasman, the leading policy adviser to the Labour leader, said the country should &#8220;draw the line&#8221; on immigration and even renegotiate EU rules that allow free movement for migrant workers.</p>
<p>He told The Daily Telegraph that Britain is &#8220;not an outpost of the UN&#8221; and the needs of the British people must be put first.</p>
<p>The comments are the most drastic yet for any of the major political parties and would effectively end immigration in to the UK.</p>
<p>However, the Labour party was last night quick to distance itself from the suggestions, insisting Lord Glasman&rsquo;s views were &#8220;his own&#8221;.</p>
<p>Immigration has been thrust back on to the political agenda by both Labour and the Conservatives.</p>
<p>David Cameron, the Prime Minister, has pledged to reduce net migration flows to the &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; and his Government has imposed an annual cap on non-EU workers.</p>
<p>In a speech earlier this month Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said mass immigration poses the biggest threat to the Coalition&rsquo;s attempts to get millions of people off benefits as foreign workers take low paid jobs.</p>
<p>And in September, Mr Miliband said the last Labour government &#8220;made mistakes&#8221; over immigration.</p>
<p>The last administration oversaw one of the largest immigration flows in the country&rsquo;s history and more than three million migrants were added to the population during its 13 years in power.</p>
<p>Lord Glasman believes the time has now come for a dramatic change where migrants would only be allowed in to the UK on a case-by-case basis and if their specific skills are needed.</p>
<p>In an interview with this newspaper, he said: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to reinterrogate our relationship with the EU on the movement of labour.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU has gone from being a sort of pig farm subsidised bloc to the free movement of labour and capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Britain is not an outpost of the UN. We have to put the people in this country first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if that meant stopping immigration virtually completely for a period, he said: &#8220;Yes. I would add that we should be more generous and friendly in receiving those [few] who are needed. To be more generous, we have to draw the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is almost certain Mr Miliband would never adopt such a drastic policy.</p>
<p>A senior Labour source said: &#8220;Maurice Glasman is a friend and colleague. His views are his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ed Miliband has made clear that the previous Labour Government made mistakes on immigration but we will set out our views clearly and after careful thought some time in the future.</p>
<p>However, the source added: &#8220;We cannot turn our backs on the free movement of labour across Europe, especially as more than one million Britons work abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview, Lord Glasman also said Gordon Brown displayed &#8220;a mix of high moralism and low cynicism&#8221;, while Tony Blair &#8220;had a slightly demented view of modernisation&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said New Labour was &#8220;almost Maoist&#8221; in its approach to modernisation.</p>
<p>He said David Miliband could have won the Labour party&rsquo;s leadership if he had agreed a partnership with the unions.</p>
<p>And he compares the Jewish settler movement to that of Islamic jihadist supremacists.</p>
<p>The full version of this interview will be published in the forthcoming issue of Fabian Review.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And in September, Mr Miliband said the last Labour government &#8216;made mistakes&rsquo; over immigration.  The last administration oversaw one of the largest immigration flows in the country&rsquo;s history and more than three million migrants were added to the population during its 13 years in power.&#8221;</p>
<p>=======</p>
<p>&#8220;Made mistakes&#8221; is an understatement. Below are the opening paragraphs from &#8220;Labour let in migrants &#8216;to engineer multicultural UK&rsquo;&#8221; Daily Mail, 24th October 2009:</p>
<p>&#8220;Huge increases in immigration over the past decade were a deliberate attempt to engineer a more multicultural Britain, a former Government adviser said yesterday. </p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew Neather, a speechwriter who worked in Downing Street for Tony Blair and in the Home Office for Jack Straw and David Blunkett, said Labour&rsquo;s relaxation of controls was a plan to &#8216;open up the UK to mass migration&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8220;As well as bringing in hundreds of thousands to plug labour market gaps, there was also a &#8216;driving political purpose&rsquo; behind immigration policy, he claimed. </p>
<p>&#8220;Ministers hoped to change the country radically and &#8216;rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity&rsquo;. But Mr Neather said senior Labour figures were reluctant to discuss the policy, fearing it would alienate its &#8216;core working-class vote&rsquo;.&#8221; </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m not sure when Labour switched from being a party representing the interests of majority white British working people to being representatives of corporate globalism and anti-patriotic multiculturalism. In any case, it seems like Lord Glasman was trying to once again make that historic connection of &#8220;Old&#8221; Labour: representing the indigenous working class. The fact that Glasman was so easily smacked down indicates &#8220;New Labour&#8221; has no intentions of changing.</p>
