<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Despite frequent media reports and city planners&rsquo; hopes to the contrary, &#8220;white flight&#8221; is stronger than ever, data from last year&rsquo;s census show.</p>
<p>The 2000 census showing an explosion of 25-34 year-olds living in inner cities was cited by urban planners and demographers as evidence that American youth were reversing their parents&rsquo; movements and were moving back to the city. But the newer data shows that this trend has now reversed itself: this generation, now ten years older, has moved back to the suburbs to settle down.</p>
<p>In the last ten years, this group&rsquo;s presence grew 12% in the suburbs and shrunk by 22.7% in &#8220;historic core cities,&#8221; like New York and San Francisco, <a href="https://blogs.forbes.com/joelkotkin/2011/07/20/why-americas-young-and-restless-will-abandon-cities-for-suburbs/">according to Joel Kotkin</a> at Forbes.</p>

		<p>  They&rsquo;ll be disappointed.  The black swarm will follow them out there, and the Mexicans are already there.</p>
<p>HUD planners will monitor neighborhoods for offensive increases in Whiteness, and that&rsquo;s where they will flood with housing vouchers for blacks.</p>
<p>Face it, ever since the 1940&rsquo;s, White Humanity has been on a long road toward genocide.  Step by step, everything is getting worse for us.  Soon, even Internet freedom will come to an end, because the unmentionable tribe will force the govt. to agree that Free Speech shouldn&rsquo;t mean hate speech.  <br>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t these &#8220;hopeful&#8221; city planners try to live in &#8220;historic core cities&#8221; with young, school age children and a young wife? Let&rsquo;s see how they like getting mugged on their own doorstep; getting punched out on the street by gangs of punks playing a depraved game; being called profane, hateful and unprovoked names in public just for being white; having their wives harassed, fondled and raped on the street and in their homes, and their kids beat up at school.  They&rsquo;d be taking &#8220;flight,&#8221; too. But don&rsquo;t worry about them - they&rsquo;d never practice what they preach. </p>

		<p>This is an obvious riddle.  The wave of young college grads about a half generation ago that were just fine living in an urban loft when they were young and single got married and had children, and then looked up and all of a sudden discovered their precious urban areas have crummy black and Hispanic public schools.  Feet don&rsquo;t fail me now.</p>
<p>And behind them, the college grads of today don&rsquo;t have access to the good jobs their analogues of a half generation ago did.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau thought St. Louis City would have its first decade over decade population growth in a long time.  In spite of the yuppies and the lofts and the rehabbing of old brick houses (most of that happened to be in neighborhoods that had not yet fallen to the blacks), the city&rsquo;s population declined again.</p>

		<p>From what I read, it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly dangerous for whites to live, work, or even shop in cities that have a significant number of blacks.  Desegregation opened the way for them to move about unimpeded in the white world, and they have become bolder with each passing year.  If they can&rsquo;t find enough whites to victimize in their own spheres, they travel into white areas to attack.  <br>
Cities are turning into hardcore ghettoes, but with lawless blacks ranging out into the suburbs, they aren&rsquo;t being contained as they once were.  Houses abandoned due to failed mortgages are being used to house Section-8 recipients, bringing ghetto blacks right into decent neighborhoods.  Do-gooder groups are importing uncivilized foreign blacks like Somalis into previously white towns.  Rural areas are about the only places left that are even theoretically safe from blacks, and you can&rsquo;t let your guard down even there.  Take, for instance, the Iowa Congressman who had a black walk right through his front door and attack the family.</p>

		<p>The fact that it is more dangerous than ever in our inner cities has a lot to do with this latest migration. Younger whites are coming to the same realization their parents did, back in the sixties and seventies. Why, place your family in a situation where they can be beaten, raped or murdered simply because of the color of their skin? The cities are slowly dying and will continue to decline as productive whites abandon them.  </p>

		<p>I read the article. They are not leaving the cities because of Blacks, they are moving to the suburbs because many of them are finally have families and they see the suburbs as giving them the opportunity to have more room, better schools and other factors that are more conducive to raising families. </p>
<p>Makes sense to me.</p>

		<p>The fact is that many of the &#8220;suburbs&#8221; are only 25-35 minutes away from the city. So, in essence, they are not really moving all that far away. In fact, if they live near public transporation,(amtrak),they can get to the cities in 10-15 minutes. </p>

		<p>Here in Detroit, blacks are leaving the city and moving to the burbs.  Most of Detroit is in ruin, burned out houses and commercial buildings everywhere.  You see, there is nowhere else for them to go.  They HAVE to go to the suburbs.  I wonder if this has something to do with the trend.</p>
<p>If you have kids, you either have to be wealthy enough to send them to private schools, or move to the burbs.  You can&rsquo;t send your kids to Detroit Public Schools unless you have hopes of them going to prison instead of college. <br>

		<p>Downtown Indianapolis is nice; the city has spent several billion over the past 20 - 30 years to make it attractive. Recently, the IMPD did the city a great service by acting like the National Guard to keep the city from being destroyed by flash mobs (posing as revelers at the Black Expo). However, once you go more than a 1 to 1.5 miles from monument circle in almost any direction, you are in &#8220;da hood&#8221;. Most of your stores like Wal-Mart, Super Target, Meijer, etc. are located outside of I-465. There are grocery stores near downtown, but they tend to be older and more run down. For anyone who even thinks of buying an 1930&rsquo;s English Tudor home; he knows up front that he will be writing checks to a private school for at least 12 years. </p>
<p>Unless you can buy your way out of IPS (Indianapolis Public Schools), your kids will be stuck in a system that is one of the lowest performers in the state. All the bloviating from a realtor about the quality and rarity of a house will not compensate your child from getting his face kicked in by 5 overgrown gang bangers in 7th grade at PS. #666. Contrast this with some of the suburban schools. In a number of the high schools that are just outside of Marion County; if your child is in the honors type programs, he/she will have a curriculum that is as stringent as the best private schools in the area. All of the public, Catholic, Lutheran, and most of the secular private schools take the ISTEP test annually. While it is not perfect, it gives you a pretty good idea of the general intelligence of your child&rsquo;s potential classmates. To be fair, there are really white areas of Indiana where the scores are abysmal and the people are not far off the mark from the movie &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221;. Housing costs reflect this. </p>
<p>Housing costs here in the Indianapolis area are some of the lowest among major metropolitan areas in the US. There are no mountains, major rivers, lakes or oceans, and rather friendly building laws. We do have a glut of useless &#8220;vinyl village&#8221; homes. The public transportation system here is atrocious, but that is by design. </p>
<p>The people in the 25-34 range may have grown up in decent situations, but when it comes to protecting their cubs, Momma and Papa Bear generally have bat brains enough to override any PC thoughts.  </p>

<p>Remember what the Episcopalians in New Orleans said after Katrina?</p>
<p>The fact that some Whites had their own resources to use in escaping the floods, while the &#8220;suffering, under served, and vulnerable&#8221; beloved communities of color couldn&rsquo;t escape, was proof of Racism.</p>
<p>In other words, if you are White and have something that blacks don&rsquo;t have, you are a Racist.   &#8220;Resources&#8221; are unearned White privileges that you haven&rsquo;t shared equitably. (Even if you had shared, you&rsquo;d still be Racist for ever having them in the first place, because you sole the unpaid labor from Africans when you were getting your stuff.  Even if you give it all away, you are still a Racist because you are still White and once had the stuff that was supposed to belong to the blacks.)</p>
<p>Same with White flight.  Resources are needed to flee, and since you have the resources, you are a Racist.</p>
<p>We all know what fate awaits Racists&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
But we should embrace the trend.  Many of the Whites who would flee are not explicitly doing so because of race. They still work for businesses, schools, and governments where they must &#8220;embrace diversity&#8221; to keep their jobs. Most of them actually believe the mandate and want to help minorities, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t cost them their jobs.</p>
<p>We should encourage the punishment of White flight, because most of the Whiteys who would get punished are not WN or RR.</p>
<p>Whites who have resources of unearned White privilege, and don&rsquo;t explicitly want to defend themselves AS MEMBERS OF A TARGETED AND VICTIMIZED WHITE HUMANITY, can have it all stolen from them for all we care.</p>
<p>We are sick and tired of Whiteys who think individually when our suffering is collective.  Whiteys must come together and think communally.  On day, we will, but it will be too late.  What role will we have for the late joiners?  Will they expect us to fight for them?  What took them so long to catch up?  Can we trust them?</p>

		<p>I have a small independent real estate brokerage and it&rsquo;s lots of fun.  I especially love to do the open houses on weekends and on occasion, an unruly black family comes in to look around and eat the free cookies with the free cokes. The kids, as always go through the owner&rsquo;s things and somehow they leave with bulging pockets but that&rsquo;s not the point of this post.  The owners let me set up in the kitchen or dining area so I always take off a picture or two and put up a few Confederate battle paintings that show the stars &amp; bars in a most prominent way.  These have the effect of horse apples in a swimming pool.  Besides, the pictures are of local battles which are historical events.  Too bad for them if it acts like repellent.  I&rsquo;ve been having this fun for 15 years and it&rsquo;s a hoot to see the expressions and hear the complaining.  Legal&hellip;yes!</p>

		<p>I think Madison Grant is bang on. Its one thing to live in the city when you are a fit and single twenty-something. But when you move along a few years in life, get married, and above all, have some children, its a very different story. My own brother had a lovely house in Scarborough (Toronto). But after his wife had twins he had to move far out to the eastern suburbs (Whitby-Oshawa). My nephews would have had to have gone to a school about 90% black-Jamaican and Pakistani.  </p>

<p>Back in the mid 1970&rsquo;s my dad, a developer, didn&rsquo;t want his latest housing project (nice middle class) to go to hell with the influx of Cubans and Blacks in South Florida. His way was exactly like yours.</p>
<p>He named every street after a well known confederate General. Stonewall Jackson Blvd, Lee Blvd, etc. (I have altered the names a bit so as to not make it really easy to find this housing development. </p>
<p>It worked. Not a single black ever drove around. Just about EVERY white understood and  had a big smile on their face when my dad showed them around.</p>
<p>Also, put the name &#8220;DIXIE&#8221; in any business you own. Like: DIXIE BAR-B-QUE. You will never, ever have to worry about a gaggle of yapping black families. Plus, blacks never tip and are a restaurant,s worst nightmare.</p>
<p>One of the best bars around is Dixie&rsquo;s. BIG HUGE BATTLE FLAG behind the bar&hellip;&hellip;no blacks, ever. Not even a Mexican or white cuban. Love it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nothing clears the mind of the foolishness of diversity than experiencing diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the old joke that a conservative is a liberal who&rsquo;s been mugged by reality is mostly false.  They&rsquo;d have to be able to recognize reality, or at least bring themselves to acknowledge it, and liberals are incapable of doing one or the other of those things, mostly the second one as their living and schooling arraignments proves.  They just drag their poisonous message to a new area without changing at all.  </p>

I have a small independent real estate brokerage and it&rsquo;s lots of fun. I especially love to do the open houses on weekends and on occasion, an unruly black family comes in to look around and eat the free cookies with the free cokes. The kids, as always go through the owner&rsquo;s things and somehow they leave with bulging pockets but that&rsquo;s not the point of this post. The owners let me set up in the kitchen or dining area so I always take off a picture or two and put up a few Confederate battle paintings that show the stars &amp; bars in a most prominent way. These have the effect of horse apples in a swimming pool. Besides, the pictures are of local battles which are historical events. Too bad for them if it acts like repellent. I&rsquo;ve been having this fun for 15 years and it&rsquo;s a hoot to see the expressions and hear the complaining. Legal&hellip;yes!</p>

The fact that it is more dangerous than ever in our inner cities has a lot to do with this latest migration. Younger whites are coming to the same realization their parents did, back in the sixties and seventies. Why, place your family in a situation where they can be beaten, raped or murdered simply because of the color of their skin? The cities are slowly dying and will continue to decline as productive whites abandon them</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Then how can you explain the growing number of White profesionals who are saturating cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, Seattle and New York? </p>

		<p>In Memphis, it is very rare for anybody but most ardent DWL/SWPL types who choose to move revived urban neighborhoods. I am glad that they go so far out of their way to be in close proximity to black populations so they can have direct daily experiences with them.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;The fact that some Whites had their own resources to use in escaping the floods, while the &ldquo;suffering, under served, and vulnerable&rdquo; beloved communities of color couldn&rsquo;t escape, was proof of Racism&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually evidence from the Katrina morgue i.e. dead bodies showed that whites in the area were more likely to be killed by hurricane Katrina. whites were something like 50% of those in the areas hardest/mainly hit by Katrina but around 60% of the bodies recovered. Not sure the exact numbers. Google &#8216;katrina morgue&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;HUD planners will monitor neighborhoods for offensive increases in Whiteness, and that&rsquo;s where they will flood with housing vouchers for blacks&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet every group and color in america have their own completely insular neighborhoods (of which they and the press will celebrate [and the government help to bring about]) including Tanzanians just a week after getting off the boat. Completely segregated and growing (and celebrating), house, school and job&hellip; because only whites can be, and are, racists.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true.  Take a few examples:  Washington, DC logged 474 homicides in 1990.  In 2010, there were 131 homicides in the city (and it has been steadily decreasing&hellip;only 61 this year and we&rsquo;re more than halfway through).  In New York City in 1990, there were an astounding 2,245 murders.  Last year, there were 516.  In 1993, Baltimore had 353 murders.  Last year, just 224.  In Chicago, there were 943 murders in 1992.  Last year, 435.</p>
<p>It is my belief that these decreases are due to better policing methods, as opposed to less deliquent behavior from blacks.</p>

<p>Whites are moving to areas with fewer Blacks because of the problems Black people cause. The force generated by &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is obviously one of repulsion rather than attraction. Places with more Blacks will generally repel Whites more strongly than areas with fewer Blacks.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t discount improvements in medical technology, plus the advent of cellphones, etc, in lowering the homicide rate. Of course this simply swells the attempted homicide rate. You need to combine BOTH to get a true gauge of violent crime.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the HUD voucher issue. The amount of money for any kind of social engineering is about to hit rock bottom.</p>
<p>The whole economy is shrinking and is do for another 15-30% trim no matter what happens.  Throughout American history its proven to be very difficult to get more than 20% of GDP in taxes </p>
<p>This is typically called Hauser&rsquo;s Law BTW</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/DWSW6" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/DWSW6</a></p>
<p>Since essentially 100% of the budget is being used for the military, everything else being payroll taxes for social security and the rest.</p>

<p>This means that even a 50% DoD cut won&rsquo;t touch the deficit and sooner or later the game will end. </p>
<p>As for the doom of white people, well not so fast. There are more White people alive on planet Earth now than ever before in history and while we are socially weak and outnumbered, that is changing. People are becoming more aware and of all of us keep up our work, do our best to be strong, proud and most important smart, there is a good change our race will make. </p>

		<p>I live in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s 80 percent minority and 20 percent white but there is NO crime and the average household income is about 200K a year. No- it&rsquo;s not middle class Blacks- there are NO blacks in our neighborhood- it&rsquo;s Indian and Chinese and other Asian immigrants. The ONLY complaint from whites is that the local schools are too academic and their white kids can&rsquo;t keep up with the smart, studious Asian kids.</p>

<p>You really think that&rsquo;s the only complaint whites in &#8220;your&#8221; neighbourhood have? How about being swamped by Asian immigrants like you, for which they never asked or wanted? How about cultural and social isolation? How about feeling like aliens in their own country and community because of people like you? I ask you again, if Indians are so great and wonderful, how come they/you flee your country at the first opportunity and invite yourselves to white, western nations? </p>

		<p>NYC was in a horrible fix in the late 80&rsquo;s. The largely Jewish power structure decided to re-segregate the city. They did this swimmingly. The Media, politicians and Wall Street all came on board.  Blacks were largely moved out, to the extent that Harlem is today 40% white.  Puerto Ricans were also out migrated. With the media&rsquo;s complicity this was largely non reported.  You can travel the length of Manhattan today and not find a contiguous black neighborhood. This is how it is done. This is how it was done.</p>
