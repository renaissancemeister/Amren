			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adm. James A. Lyons, Washington Times, July 12, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Today, the mind-numbing disease of political correctness has so infected the American military leadership that it is a threat in itself. The political correctness mentality was the principal reason why Fort Hood&rsquo;s alleged murderer, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was not cashiered out of the Army after a shocking June 2007 PowerPoint presentation he gave as part of his psychiatric residency program. In that presentation, he reportedly warned his Army colleagues and supervisor at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of &#8220;adverse events&#8221; that would occur if the Army did not accept the precepts of Islamic Shariah law and grant Muslims serving in the Army conscientious objector status.</p>
<p>He went on to describe what he meant by adverse events, citing previous cases of Muslims murdering their fellow soldiers, spying against the United States, deserting their units and refusing to deploy. None of his fellow doctors or his supervisor reported his remarks, most likely out of fear of being labeled a bigot or racist, which in today&rsquo;s military could end one&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>Now it seems the Army has embraced Maj. Hasan&rsquo;s position in an incredible decision made last month by the secretary of the Army to grant conscientious objector status to Pfc. Naser Abdo. He is a 21-year-old soldier, a member of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., who refused to deploy to Afghanistan, claiming that Shariah law prevented him from killing other Muslims.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By acceding to the dictates of Shariah, the Army has tacitly endorsed an absurd position that in effect sanctions Muslim service members to kill non-Muslims but forbids them to kill Muslims. Further, it is an unbelievable basis on which to classify them as conscientious objectors.</p>
<p>When Pfc. Abdo enlisted, he stated he initially believed that he could be a soldier and a Muslim at the same time. What changed his vision? He stated that his understanding of Islam &#8220;changed&#8221; as he went through training ahead of a planned deployment to Afghanistan. He worried whether going to war was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>By granting conscientious objector status to Pfc. Abdo, the Army is tacitly accepting a key tenet of the Islamic doctrine of jihad, as embraced by al Qaeda and other terrorists groups, which states that any incursion by non-Muslims into the Islamic lands makes it the duty for all Muslims to fight the &#8220;occupiers.&#8221; This view is shared by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has challenged American efforts in Afghanistan as &#8220;unwelcome outsiders,&#8221; in effect, occupiers.</p>
<p>The U.S. military is the finest in the world. It represents the best of America. We have many Muslims serving honorably in the U.S. military and their service should not be tainted by Pfc. Abdo&rsquo;s conscientious objector designation. His discharge from the Army is currently on hold because he has been charged with possession of child pornography. That should not be surprising: Shariah sanctions marriage of girls 9 years old and younger, in effect, legalized pedophilia.</p>

		<p>I guess it&rsquo;s okay for Christians to kill Christians with no problem in American wars, Revolutionary, 1812, Civil (apparently some Southern Jews killed some Northern Jews and  vice versa in battle), Spanish American, WW1, WW2&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;then again, one of the main reasons the First Crusade was so successful the Moslems and their various sects hated each other and killed each other more than they did the Christians.</p>

		<p>The US government should just say that by collaborating with the Americans and allowing themselves to be subdued by the infidel, Afghans and Iraqis have proven that they are not true Muslims. So he can still fight them with a clear conscience. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>Moslems are killing Moslems all around the world with rifles, bombs, and land mines.  What if Christians said they do not want to kill Christians; only wanted to kill Moslems or non-Christians?  Send that Moslem to the prison at Ft. Levenworth for mutiny.   Has our government surrendered to our enemies, we haven&rsquo;t surrendered. </p>

		<p>Given that so many of the trouble spots in the world are Muslim nations requiring US vigilence and occasional intervention, Muslims simply should be excluded from US military service.</p>

<p>Those now serving and those in training and those awaiting induction should be dismissed or turned away as required.</p>

		<p>As has been expressed here many times (and it has crystalized my thoughts on the subject to read these comments), I would NOT take up arms against a white foe.<br>
I will NOT slay my brethren, however distant. We may be about 10% of the world&rsquo;s population now, down from a guesstimate of 50% a hundred years ago. To me, a drop of white blood, and the DNA it contains, is the treasure of the world, the only vehicle which can carry man out of these times into any bright future. </p>
<p>I can at least understand why a Muslim would not take up arms against one of his clan. (And they, being more inbred, are much more a clan).</p>
<p>Be that as it may:</p>
<p>I care not a whit for a shariah- preaching Muslim&rsquo;s views, but they are his own, and I don&rsquo;t want to hear him. Or see him. He should be somewhere near the birthplace of his abhorrent views.<br>
Get all such people on a boat out of here.</p>

		<p>Abdo is not a traitor or conscientious objector. Why? Because he is not an American. No muslim country, or for that matter any non White country, would allow an alien, both in body and soul, among them. Abdo&rsquo;s presence in this country and our army is just one of the many ludicrous manifestations of White marxist nilhilism.</p>
<p>Let Abdo go back to his hovel of origin and marry a nine year old. The real traitors are the White marxists in the government. They are the ones who should be prosecuted and punished.</p>

		<p>It seems there are lots of things they could do for the military that would not require them to shoot at other moslems. They could go out and carry wounded soldiers off the field, they could disarm bombs. Lots of stuff like that. Don&rsquo;t even need to give them a weapon. If they get killed, there are always those 72 virgins waiting for them.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here. The Washington Times is a fiercely anti-Islamic newspaper, and the anti-Islamic angle of this story is fragrant! </p>
<p>This story isn&rsquo;t about the Army accepting Sharia Law - it is really about the US Army protecting its politically-correct rear-end, and worming out of admitting that they were probably terrified of sending this Muslim into a combat-zone, and having to explain still another attack or meltdown by one of their own, killing his fellow soldiers, etc.  </p>
<p>Our government - military and all - has backed itself into a curious corner. At once they preach all this &#8220;tolerance&#8221; and Islam-firendly twaddle day and night&hellip;even as they wage war with no less than THREE Muslim nations in one capacity or another. And it is no secret(at least not to anyone who knows them personally)that American military personnel are not exactly possessed of positve opinions of Muslims - and that&rsquo;s being gentle. Quite a conundrum, is it not?    </p>

		<p>Israel is like 1/5 Arab but doesn&rsquo;t use Arab citizens in the military. It is just obvious plain common sense. Their religion DEMANDS that they fight the infidels and not in a metaphorical sense either. It would be like recruiting open communists in the 1950s, it makes no sense.</p>

		<p>We are facing a full 3rd Jihad in Europe - with the full assistance of our treasonous political elite. So I have a lot more experience with this cult than most Yanks.</p>
<p>Firstly, do not underestimate Islam. It has already taken over 54 nations.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the Muslim ideology, there exists just two Nations - The Dar al Islamia and the Dar al Harb. Literally, the Nation of Islam and the Nation of War.</p>
<p>This soldier, trained and fed by the Nation of War (in this case the USA) actually only purports to belong to the USA. In fact, in his own ideology, he belongs devoutly to the Nation of Islam, as his actions demonstrate.</p>
<p>Consequently, every single Muslim is a 5th columnist and is guilty of High Treason, for the simple explanation that they belong and give first loyalty to the Nation of Islam and the Islamic imperative to change this part of the Nation of War (USA) into the Nation of Islam via the steady implementation of Sharia Law as opposed to the US Constitution.</p>

		<p>Poster number 5 preaches wisdom.  We should not take up arms against members of our race (European Americans/Europeans/Nordics).  We should not fight against our own people.  We have been cuddled and hoodwinked and deceived into fighting our own for too many years.  </p>
<p>Let Pfc. Naser Abdo take his people and his Shariah law and go to his own country.  He does not belong, nor will he ever belong, within any Western/Occidental established country.  Western/Occidental lands were founded and instituted for White people only; no one else.  Why would the Founding Fathers (European Americans/Europeans/Nordics) of America and Europe and other Western established lands build a home (establish a country) for this guy and his religion?  Where is Charles (&ldquo;the Hammer&rdquo;) Martel when we need him?            </p>

		<p>This is a scam.  This guy wanted all the benefits of a military career UNTIL he was about to be sent to a war zone.  Then his conscience started bothering him.  In all probability, the &#8220;war against the Muslims&#8221; was already in full swing when he enlisted.  The military should screen people more carefully before allowing enlistment, and it goes without saying that the USA should NOT be letting millions of Muslims who are rooting for the other team to settle in the USA.</p>

		<p>Does anyone else see hypocrisy in wanting to send Muslims back to where they came from (100% agree) and then still support militarilly invading their countries? <br>
If, *hypothetically*, we could empty Europe and America of every last Muslim, but the flipside was that we couldn&rsquo;t invade Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, etc. Would you take that deal?</p>

		<p>One can be a good Muslim and a bad American, or a bad Muslim and a good American, but one cannot be a good Muslim and a good American. To be a &#8220;good&#8221; (devout, loyal to the faith) Muslim, one must renounce all loyalty to America or any other non-Muslim nation, and pledge loyalty to Allah and Allah alone. The concepts of Separation of Church and State and Render Unto Caesar are White, Western concepts which do not exist in the Islamic world. These are all excellent reasons why Muslims should neither be allowed in the military nor allowed to immigrate to our country. Both are privileges, not rights.</p>
<p>All the liberal, neo-con, and self-proclaimed &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslim talking heads who claim that one can be both a loyal Muslim and a loyal American are lying. Those who are loyal to Islam in their hearts, no matter how moderate or patriotic they claim to be, will always side with Islam whenever it and America come into conflict. Those with the misfortune to have been born Muslim, but who are truly loyal to America in their hearts, should renounce their faith openly, for they have already renounced it in their hearts.</p>

		<p>I agree that there is never anything beautiful or glorious about whites killing other whites. </p>
<p>One of the worst offenders in this category was a little corporal, a white man, who 72 years ago launched an invasion of a nation of fellow whites, without provocation and without cause, sending his dive-bombers and his tanks to kill white men, women, and children. Let those of us who are pro-white pragmatists distance ourselves from the fools who continue to revere that foolish man.</p>

		<p>If we are delving into history, then, as pro-White pragmatists, we cannot stop with one &ldquo;little corporal&rdquo;.  Let us look at the individuals that established silly alliances leading to WWI.  And, let us look at a leader that put items in place to initiate a civil war to keep the Union together.  And, let us revisit another little corporal that inflicted tremendous destruction and loss of life throughout Europe.  White fighting and killing White is an old story: The history of &ldquo;us&rdquo; fighting &ldquo;us&rdquo; seems to proceed on and on and on.  It must pragmatically cease or we will become extinct.  And on the road to extinction, what our antagonists inflict upon us and ours may be compared to Hades on earth.  Our enemies cunningly play upon this hostility of White against White.  Pfc. Naser Abdo living in our country of America proves that we have clearly let our guard down.  Most of the soldiers being killed and suffering in Iraq and Afghanistan are of our race.  And, let us, also, not forget a swaggering little lieutenant (Mr. Bush) that finished the war to which his father started.<br>
               <br>
I will agree WWII was utterly devastating to our White race but so was the Bolshevik revolution.  However, if life is a learning experience to process (which it is as I believe), then as pragmatists, we should move away from becoming involved in any conflict concerning our own.  And moving closer to the present, within all components and facets of life, if any mental or physical action is not for the complete betterment of our race (European American/European [that of Western/Occidental culture and ethnicity]) we should ardently refuse and emphatically reject said action.               <br>

		<p>Pfc. Naser Abdo. He is a 21-year-old soldier, a member of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., who refused to deploy to Afghanistan, claiming that Shariah law prevented him from killing other Muslims.</p>
<p> This is absurd. Armies are required to kill the enemy. It is a regrettable but eternal part of warfare. Some draftees, who claimed to be conscientious objectors during World War I and II, were imprisoned for refusing to fire on enemy soldiers. Why should Mr. Abdo, a volunteer not a draftee, be excused? Muslims have been fighting and killing each other in the Middle East since the death of the Prophet. It is happening right now in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. </p>

If war is about fighting, and quite possibly killing the enemy, then that sort of political correctness has no place in military life. </p>
<p>If an American Muslim will not fight the enemies of America, he should be tried and sentenced, to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>Can we afford to have a case of &#8220;sudden jihad&#8221;, among officers aboard a submarine capable of launching missiles with nuclaer warheads, for instance?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about religion; this isn&rsquo;t only about oil or the state of Israel: we are going to have a war of civilisations! And I hope the US Army quickly realizes what it has to do!</p>

When someone attacks America, I am American first, American second, American third. When someone attacks Islam, I am Muslim first, Muslim second, Muslim third. When someone attacks my family, I am a Babul first, a Babul second, and a Babul third. </p>
<p>I would bet that you have similar, apparently contradictory, loyalties. But that&rsquo;s how we all are in a free society. </p>

		<p>&#8220;One can be a good Muslim and a bad American, or a bad Muslim and a good American&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a &#8220;good muslim&#8221; They are all terrorists waiting for the right chance. Some people call a Python a &#8220;pet&#8221; until it swallows their 2 year old daughter, such is the muslim, they cannot be trusted, they are invaders and hostile by nature and their Quran to anything not muslim. Muslims in all their forms (to include stOOpid black American converts) should be run out of America and the mosques totally destroyed. I am in the muddled east and know what I am talking about. Sort of like being in Detroit soldiers from Detroit here tell me (White soldiers BTW)having that damed muzzin (call to prayer) blasting all over the city now. DON&rsquo;T TRUST MUSLIMS! your life and liberties depend on that simple statement.</p>

		<p>@Babul,</p>
<p>Your position is ambiguous as is, I suspect, your professed loyalty to the USA.  Whose side will you be on if or when America next &#8220;attacks a Muslim country&#8221; in response to the next Muslim-led atrocity against America? Because for sure this is going to happen and this time there will be many more than 3000 victims.</p>
<p>The &#8220;free society&#8221; you blithely speak of has never, nor can ever exist, under Islam, so I am sure you are a first and foremost a Muslim and therefore an unreliable citizen if not a traitor in waiting.  Please demonstrate your &#8220;loyalty&#8221; by either apostasing NOW or say GOODBYE, because ISLAM is the weakest link in western civilisation..!!   </p>

		<p>Babul, what happens when Muslims attack America? What happens when America fights back?</p>
<p>Muslims and those with similar foreign loyalties can never be a part of Western civilisation for this simple reason. The tenets of Christianity or indeed general humanistic morals will not run counter to the principles underpinning our society, because the two developed in tandem. </p>
<p>Cruel alien creeds which put themselves above the founding principles of, and by extension the rights guaranteed by, Western societies, which then seek the protection of those rights can never be countenanced- this is the &#8220;Goedel statement&#8221; of a liberal democracy- we cannot allow, in Western society, the propagation of culture and genetics that would lead to the dismantlement of Western society. Hard though it sounds, you have no place among us.</p>
