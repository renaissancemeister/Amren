<h1>High School Student Alleges Racial Bias in Valedictorian Choice</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzi Parker, Reuters, July 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A black high school valedictorian says in a federal lawsuit that her school discriminated against her when they made her share the stage with a white &#8220;co-valedictorian&#8221; who had a lower grade point average.</p>
<p>School officials told Kymberly Wimberly, 18, that it was because the other student had more class credits, according to the lawsuit. School officials have said publicly that the valedictorians are chosen based on both grades and difficulty of course work.</p>
<p>Wimberly, who said she was the first black valedictorian in more than 20 years at the tiny high school, believes it was racial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A day after learning that she would be the valedictorian of the 2011 graduating class at McGehee Secondary School, she was told that she would have to share the honor with a white, female student.</p>
<p>Both students gave valedictory speeches at the May 13th graduation.</p>
<p>{snip} The lawsuit is asking for $75,000 in damages.</p>
<p>The superintendent is black. The principal is white. The lawsuit states the school board is primarily white.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wimberly said she graduated with a 4.0 grade point average and took honors and advanced placement classes. She briefly left school during the fall semester of junior year after giving birth to her daughter, missing three weeks of class.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The white student had a lower GPA but more credits. But Wimberly said credits only come into play when two students tie with the same GPA.</p>

		<p>From the school handbook:</p>
<p>The determination of class rank will be: <br>
$ Students will be ranked by grade point averages. <br>
$ Grades from all four years of an accredited high school will be used; including Algebra I taken in the 8th grade. <br>
$ The final senior ranking will be figured at the end of the school year. <br>
$ If two or more students take the same or equivalent course work and receive the same grades <br>
 of &ldquo;A&rdquo;, a student with a greater number of courses will not be penalized.  </p>
<p>The last point applies and so the two were tied for 1st place. Liberals everywhere are howling about this one. Even this cases of obvious racism turn out to be completely non racist, yet these liberals think racism is everywhere.</p>

		<p>There might be more to this story than the media are letting on.  Whenever I form my opinions about these matters, I always have to keep this in mind, because even I have fallen sucker for media narratives about certain blacks and their &#8220;intelligence&#8221; (i.e. Kobe Bryant).  </p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re not lying, then I can agree this news is an injustice.  What is also an injustice is the recent trend of using criteria other than straight up GPA to determine the class valedictorian, because GPA alone has a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; on certain minorities.  For every one like Miss Wimberly, there are probably 100 white people who should have been their class valedictorian but weren&rsquo;t because their school wanted to give a black or Hispanic some measure of &#8220;self-esteem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Oh the horror! She had to share with a White girl! It never ceases to amaze me how much blacks hate Whites. It is their all consuming passion. So Kymberly Wimberly left school for three months of maternity leave in her senior year. How typical. </p>

		<p>Sheesh, give me a break here. 75,000 in damages for what pray tell? Did she not get to be valedictorian too and give her speech? Why, yes she did. I wonder if it ever occurred to her that if it was racial, they wouldn&rsquo;t have given her the honor to begin with.</p>
<p>No, the only person here with a race issue is YOU Kymberly. Having to share the limelight with a WHITE girl clearly upsets you.</p>
<p>But, I suppose any way you can get money to help raise that baby you had at age 17 will do. Great role model for your fellow classmates by the way.</p>

		<p>This happened all the time when I was in school. The White kids took AP and College courses, getting B&rsquo;s. The Black kids took remedial alphabet learning and got A&rsquo;s. Then they got ranked as &#8220;top of the class&#8221;. Sure.</p>

		<p>From the article, &#8220;She received a &#8220;B&#8221; in English that semester, but pulled her grade up to an &#8220;A&#8221; by spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how  grades work at this school but to get a 4.0 don&rsquo;t you need perfect straight As? How can you get a &#8220;B&#8221; (a 3.0) and then still have a perfect GPA? If you got a B in one semester than wouldn&rsquo;t your GPA be like 3.95 or something?</p>
<p>It seems perhaps this Valedictorian got her grades boosted through threats and harassment perhaps? I am guessing she protested that she couldn&rsquo;t get As because she had to raise her daughter and theatened the school until they just raised her grades.</p>

		<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a white kid as valedictorian at my kid&rsquo;s school in over 20 years. It is always either an Indian kid or an East Asian kid- yet I don&rsquo;t see the whites complaining and demanding affirmative action. They just accept the fact that Asian kids study harder. I have to admire whites for being so humble and accepting of it. I am thinking of starting an affirmative action program at my kid&rsquo;s high school so white have a shot at the valedictorian for class of 2012. It&rsquo;s NOT FAIR that Asians outachieve them.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s nothing.  When I graduated high school there were so many of us with perfect 4.0s (all white girls) that I shared the stage with 6 other valedictorians.  Nothing to be proud about, really, with the state of modern education.</p>

<p>Geesh Sureesh! Would you lay off? You&rsquo;re not being productive or helpful coming here to berate the poor, dumb White kids. Why rub salt in the wound?</p>
<p>  Why don&rsquo;t you start a program for the Whites to emulate the Indians, then perhaps they can close the gap? Maybe it&rsquo;s the superior Indian culture&hellip;.they say that 1/3 of the desperately poor people of the world are in India where they earn $1.23 a day. Should we burn dead bodies on the banks of the Sacramento and then push the ashes into the river (along with sewage and industrial waste)? Should we open up Rat Temples like Karni Mata to feed rats while people starve (I understand the white rats are especially sacred)? Should the dress code include tight as a drum turbans and red dots?</p>
<p>  Why don&rsquo;t you live in India? As I remember you were eager to get the Whites out of the subcontinent. I think you&rsquo;d be a lot happier there.<br>

		<p>I would think black Kymberly is the racist.  Would she have levied a suit had the other co-valedictorian been another black under the same circumstances?  If she couldn&rsquo;t have claimed racism, what would she have said?  Nothing.  <br>
We have taught and allowed an entitled class to make up their own subjective standards, even when objective standards exist and are in writing.  <br>
Bets on whether this bright light makes it to med school?  Another racist disappointment is in her future.  Couldn&rsquo;t possibly be her not being competitive.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to know how this brain-child arrived at $75,000 for damages? She was valedictorian  &mdash;  she just had to share it. Does valedictorian now pay money, and she had to split it? This is total nonsense is a frivolous lawsuit, and if an attorney filed it he should be disbarred.</p>

		<p>Sometimes the minority/victim is right. Could be the way a stopped clock is right once a day. Could be, despite themselves, they really are the one who is the victim. Since it&rsquo;s so very rare, and only one aspect of their life (which is surely an aberration), we should let the victim in these cases suffer and offer them no help and pay them no mind. </p>

		<p>Imagine the naivete of a young black girl, thinking she might be given the distinction of being regarded top in her class simply for having the highest grades. Now imagine the heartbreak for a young white girl, having to temper her pride with humiliation, knowing she was surpassed academically by this same black girl. To think that she was bested by someone of lesser genetic ability, who did so in spite of taking time off to have a child, must be agonizing. Its clear who the real victim is here: the pride of the proud white community.</p>

		<p>This has nothing to do with her not liking white or there is no evidence of it. She just wanted to the share the spotlight by herself . and who wouldn&rsquo;t  in an area where other groups most often get the top price. Would a white  sprinter be happy to tie for first with a black sprinter in the 100 meter race in the Olympic?</p>

When some Indian &#8220;engineer&#8221; comes up with an original idea then get back to us.  You voted on the question already.  You voted that Whites had a superior society than Indians; you traveled here.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, if she doesn&rsquo;t make it to med school, you can be sure that &#8220;racism&#8221; will be to blame.  Institutional white racism, ingrained racism, historical racism, the legacy of slavery, the lingering memory of Jim Crow &hellip; whatever.  Racism  (thus automatically white people) will be the culprit that will keep  this brilliant young scholar from achieving her true potential.</p>
<p>There will be more calls for &#8220;fighting racism&#8221;, more social programs, more tax money (yours), more groveling apologies.   Pay up, Whitey!  You bearers of White Privilege  will never finish paying for all the harm you have done to this sterling young woman&hellip; and to her child, and to her grandchildren, ad infinitum.</p>

		<p>I happened to catch on one the cable news shows that the difference in GPA was some very tiny number, something like 0.02. And no, I don&rsquo;t think you can have a straight 4.0 if you get a B (3.0)in a class. You&rsquo;ll be very close, but it won&rsquo;t be a 4.0.</p>

		<p>The article doesnt delve into the calculation methods too deeply.  It could be that they were both straight A students and just took differently-weighted classes.</p>
<p>In my school, the top 10 or so students were all straight A students, it was just a matter of what classes were taken (an A in a standard class was 4.0, in an honors class was 4.4, and an AP was 4.8).</p>
<p>So as poster #2 noted, it was likely just a weighting issue.  </p>
<p>Also, in our school, rank was based on inal grade for the year not grades all year.  So someone who got A/B/A/B/A during the year and someone who got A/A/A/A/A during the year would both be A for the year (four quarters plus final exam).</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s black paranoia not white insecurity.  If I&rsquo;m feeling insecure about my whiteness, all I need to do is google GDP of Europe vs. Africa and then feel pleny secure about whites&rsquo; intellectual superiority in general.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like the conspiracy theory mentality, but it sure looks like this is intentional.

<p>&#8220;Imagine the naivete of a young black girl, thinking she might be given the distinction of being regarded top in her class simply for having the highest grades. Now imagine the heartbreak for a young white girl, having to temper her pride with humiliation, knowing she was surpassed academically by this same black girl. To think that she was bested by someone of lesser genetic ability, who did so in spite of taking time off to have a child, must be agonizing. Its clear who the real victim is here: the pride of the proud white community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonsense.  The White community has no pride, it has already been beaten, raped, and robbed out of them.  What they do still have is sometimes individual pride.</p>
<p>But all that is aside from the real issue.  My issue with this story is how she managed to get a 4.0 while missing so much school, and to have a baby?  Someone somewhere had to be helping her out a great deal.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that imply some sort of cheating?  I think there is a back story here, because as the arrogance of the poster above illustrates, this black girl beat all the white kids with &#8220;one hand tied behind her back.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The lawsuit is asking for $75,000 in damages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like she&rsquo;s already trying to raise her college tuition.  But is she was as smart as her title of valedictorian implies, she would have asked for three times that amount.  I guess she figures she can use a race hustle to pay for the rest later.</p>

		<p>One fact is always consistent:  no matter what white people do or don&rsquo;t do, blacks hate us-because of their own deficiencies in looks, character, motivation and intelligence.  What else can one expect from a group of people who don&rsquo;t even like their own HAIR. But ultimately, whiners like this kimberly person are doing us a favor by educating whites, liberals not withstanding, about what blacks are truly like.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has nothing to do with her not liking white or there is no evidence of it. She just wanted to the share the spotlight by herself . and who wouldn&rsquo;t in an area where other groups most often get the top price. Would a white sprinter be happy to tie for first with a black sprinter in the 100 meter race in the Olympic?&#8221;</p>
<p>You mean &#8220;Olympics?&#8221; Well, in a word, yes.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of a scene from my high school days in 1969.  We had a particular white kid, who was not only white, but a toehead blonde, very Nordic looking, and a great sprinter.  The black kids on the track team already carried the conceit and expectation that NO white could ever beat a black.  I witnessed what happens when a white best a black in a 100 yard sprint.  The white kid beat three blacks.  The group was of course tight, because 100 yards is short and will normally see a tight pack at the finish. As the white kid made his last stride to hit the finish line, one of the black kids shoved the white winner at the shoulder in a clear attempt to punish him by causing him to stumble and fall onto the pavement.  The race was held on blacktop at the end of gym class.  Even then, no one, not even the coach said anything about the blatant violation of sportsmanship and the obvious racism of the incident.</p>
