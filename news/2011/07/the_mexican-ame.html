			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pew Hispanic Center, July 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ">Births
have overtaken immigration as the main driver of the dynamic growth in the U.S.
Hispanic population. This new trend is especially evident among the largest of
all Hispanic groups  &mdash;  Mexican-Americans, according to a new analysis of U.S.
Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research
Center.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">In the
decade from 2000 to 2010, the Mexican-American population grew by 7.2 million
as a result of births and 4.2 million as a result of new immigrant arrivals.
This is a change from the previous two decades when the number of new
immigrants either matched or exceeded the number of births.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">The
current surge in births among Mexican-Americans is largely attributable to the
immigration wave that has brought more than 10 million immigrants to the United
States from Mexico since 1970. Between 2006 and 2010 alone, more than half
(53%) of all Mexican-American births were to Mexican immigrant parents. As a
group, these immigrants are more likely than U.S.-born Americans to be in their
prime child-bearing years. They also have much higher fertility.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">Meanwhile,
the number of new immigrant arrivals from Mexico has fallen off steeply in
recent years. According to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of Mexican government
data, the number of Mexicans annually leaving Mexico for the U.S. declined from
more than one million in 2006 to 404,000 in 2010-a 60% reduction.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>This is likely a result of recent
developments in both the U.S. and Mexico. On the U.S. side, declining job
opportunities and increased border enforcement (</span><a href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=112"><span style="color:#27506C">Passel and Cohn, 2009</span></a><span style="color:black">)
may have made the U.S. less attractive to potential Mexican immigrants. And in
Mexico, recent strong economic growth may have reduced the &#8220;push&#8221; factors that
often lead Mexicans to emigrate to the U.S.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">As a
result, there were fewer new immigrant arrivals to the U.S. from Mexico in the
2000s (4.2 million) than in the 1990s (4.7 million). However, the Mexican-American
population continued to grow rapidly, with births accounting for 63% of the
11.2 million increase from 2000 to 2010. </span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">At 31.8
million in 2010, Mexican-Americans comprise 63% of the U.S. Hispanic population
and 10% of the total U.S. population (</span><a href="/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf"><span style="color:#27506C">Ennis, RÃ­os-Vargas and Albert, 2011</span></a><span style="color:black">). According to Pew Hispanic Center tabulations from the
March 2010 U.S. Current Population Survey, 39% of Mexican-Americans-or 12.4
million-are immigrants.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>With the
exception of Russia, no other country in the world has as many immigrants from
all countries as the U.S. has from Mexico alone.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Nor does any country in the world have
as many citizens living abroad as does Mexico. According to the World Bank
(2011), more than 10% of Mexico&rsquo;s native-born population lives elsewhere, with
the vast majority (97%) of these expatriates living in the United States.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">Overall,
the Hispanic population of the United States grew from 35.3 million in 2000 to
50.5 million in 2010, accounting for more than half of the nation&rsquo;s overall
population growth during that decade (</span><a href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=140"><span style="color:#27506C">Passel, Cohn and Lopez, 2011</span></a><span style="color:black">). Some 58% of this Hispanic population increase came from
births rather than the arrival of new immigrants. However, for many
non-Mexican-origin Hispanic groups in the U.S., births accounted for less than
half of their population growth in the past decade. For example, from 2000 to
2010, births accounted for just 38% of the growth of the Cuban-American
population and just 39% of the growth of the population of U.S. Hispanics of
Central or South American origin.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="color:black">Hispanics
now comprise 16.3% of the total U.S. population. This share is projected to
rise to 29% by the middle of this century, with the bulk of the future increase
driven by births, many the descendents of today&rsquo;s immigration wave, rather than
the arrival of new immigrants. (</span><a href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=85"><span style="color:#27506C">Passel and Cohn, 2008</span></a><span style="color:black">).</span></p>

		<p>The demographic tidal wave is now upon us.  Once population numbers reach a certain tipping point, it is impossible to alter the outcome.  In a few short generations, the once mighty USA will be 10 to 25% White, and just another Third World hell-hole. <br>
America&rsquo;s enemies will have accomplished their goal of destroying the greatest nation that has ever existed.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In the decade from 2000 to 2010, the Mexican-American population grew by 7.2 million as a result of births and 4.2 million as a result of new immigrant arrivals.&#8221;</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>What part of those Mexican American births were to Mexican illegal alien mothers?  We can calculate a rought answer.  </p>
<p>According to the 2005 Center for Immigration Studies report:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new analysis of birth records by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that in 2002 almost one in four births in the United States was to an immigrant mother (legal or illegal), the highest level in American history. In addition, nearly ten percent of all births in the country were to illegal-alien mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10/25 = 40 percent of all births to immigrant mothers</p>
<p>We can therefore extrapolate that 40 percent of the 7.2 million increase in the population of Mexican Americans due to births   &mdash;  -  that is, 2.9 million   &mdash;  - is the result of Mexican parents illegally n the United States and, ultimately, the result of a deformed and historically ignorant interpretation of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s Citizenship Clause that makes this outrage possible.</p>
<p>Congress could correct this abuse of the 14th Amendment if it chose.  There has indeed been a number of bills introduced to do just that.  One had as many as 87 co-sponsors.  None, however, to my knowledge, has received a committee hearing.  I think the GOP leadership, under the guidance of political operatives such as Karl Rove, fears/feared being labeled anti-Hispanic. The mighty Hispanic vote   &mdash;  - about 8 percent in the last presidential election   &mdash;  - rules all in GOP leadership circles.</p>

		<p>Which reminds me: A few days ago, I called U.S. District Judge Munley, of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, to ask when their remand hearing will take place in the case of Pedro Lozano v. Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which had been the subject of a remand Order by the U.S. Supreme Court after The Court upheld Arizona&rsquo;s e-verify law.  The staff member of Judge Munley&rsquo;s chambers told me they plan to speak with the parties before scheduling any remand hearing. Meanwhile, New Jersey has companion Bills to require e-verify, but the Democrats control and we are stifled. </p>

		<p>Race change is no cause for alarm to the elite financial stakeholders.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters to them is consumption.  A Mexican mother will buy diapers with money which is just as green as that of a white mother. Mexicans will buy gasoline and automobiles and consume energy just as readily as a white American.  </p>
<p>In some ways a Mexican takeover is desirable for the shareholder class, because Mexicans will probably buy less durable goods and be in a perpetual state of living hand to mouth.</p>
<p>The few employable whites that are left can look forward to consolation jobs in the police, army and prison guard establishment. They&rsquo;ll kept on a leash by their corporate masters, for the purpose of enforcing property laws on the brown underclass.</p>

		<p> E Pluribus Pluribus makes a lot of good points. He references a 2005 report that showed in 2002 (nearly ten years ago) almost 10 percent of births were to illegal aliens. Not long ago we got the dreadful news that minority births now outnumber white ones. Closing the birthright loophole who change this overnight. But  the pathetic Republicans who control the House continue to dither; what in the world are they waiting for?! Why aren&rsquo;t they bringing one of those birthright bills to the floor for a vote? It may not pass in the Senate and Obama might prove to be an obstacle, but for goodness sake, get the ball rolling on this vital issue! What we face is a crisis of leadership. The parties of dweedle dee and tweedle dumb. The country&rsquo;s sinking.. and nothing is being done by our rulers. </p>

		<p>If we would just lose the selfish, baby-boomer mentality and have more children, this would not be an issue.  I place the blame for the decline of our birthrate squarely where it belongs, on all the anti-family egocentric attitudes of the Boomers.  They aborted their children at huge rates, divorced multiple times, and failed to raise the children they have.  How can we be angry at hispanics for doing what God tells us to do, i.e. be fruitful and multiply?</p>
<p>But this would require personal sacrifice and inconvenience, something the Boom generation just can&rsquo;t tolerate.</p>

		<p>These high birth rates among these people are just another form of child abuse, especially since the economy is going to continue its downward spiral for a long time and social freebies will eventually be cut to almost nothing in every state in the union.  </p>
<p>Bringing more children into the world than a couple can afford relegates them to a life of want, and in most cases, abject poverty.</p>
<p>Up till now the elites wanted the extra warm bodies to create population growth, since whites are not having enough children.  With population growth comes a requirement for economic growth, which is bad for everything and everyone except the big money elites and politicos who want more power, assets and money constantly.</p>
<p>The greed driving the Western world will soon be its downfall, because a growing population during severe economic times will cause large scale civil unrest that will more likely than not destroy a nation.</p>

<p>Why not say that any illegal mother and no more than two men that she declares are fathers of her children be given American Citizenship after she has 8 anchor babies here?</p>

		<p>Bombs couldn&rsquo;t do it, nor guns or tanks. Our country has stood firm against our enemies since its inception. But now, we have succumbed to a third world country who has defeated us by simply waking in, occupying and producing millions more people. Our leaders think in terms of votes and cheap labor, so they stand before us and mouth platitudes about how we must take care of the world or we are not living up to the values on which this nation was built. They seem to forget we now have laws for coming to this country correctly, but in their greed they prefer to overlooks the rules. We are now subject to third world hell holes who urge their people to ignore our laws. We have a special enemy, one who is undergoing a holocaust in its own country. Mexico is the culprit and its leaders never stop reminding us how terrible we are, but demand that we take its people. In turn, our own leaders are only too happy to hand out our most precious birthright - citizenship - like Halloween candy. Until we elect someone who thinks more of his/her own people than the welfare of criminals, we are doomed</p>

<p>Let me re-phrase this for you then I can agree.</p>
<p>Enter WHITE Americans, not just the word, Americans. You imply that ANY so-called American can be any color and are Americans.</p>
<p>The only TRUE American is of the White race. Read the TRUE intent of our Founders and of the thirteen colonies. The rest (nonwhite)are illegitimate and made &#8220;american&#8221; by our enemy within. They are NOT Americans.</p>

		<p>There you have it. Now you will understand the South African experience and how fast the blacks procreated. So fast that it all hit most of us by surprise.</p>
<p>And we were even less in a position to appreciate the full extend of the population explosion, for back then we were not yet in the internet age. We were dependent on the main stream newspapers.</p>
<p>They told us nothing. </p>
<p>And all of a sudden one day we were confronted by the dismantling of the Apartheid laws, namely the Group Areas influx control Act, which was supposed to protect us against the black masses. </p>
<p>When that law was dismantled, it was dismantled by the State President P.W. Botha by a press statement with the reasoning that we have been anyway surrounded by blacks so the Act made no sense anymore. </p>
<p>And then for the first time we have been presented with population figures and graphs in the press. I still remember it like yesterday.</p>

		<p>Neither of the political parties will touch this with a 10 foot pole. Even with a future 100 % enforcement of immigration laws this &#8220;inner immigration&#8221; will wreck this country within a very few decades. 20 years after the first black prez we will see the first Indio in the White House.</p>
<p>As politics and the law will not be able to take care of this, I predict that a collapse similar to the one of the USSR will split this country into several entities. One or two among them hopefully white.</p>

		<p>I am so happy I found a site that covers news stories that the main stream media is afraid to touch for fear of being labeled &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I lived in Southern California for 17 years and watched it go from bad to worse as a child and moved away as quickly as possible. Latino&rsquo;s have destroyed southern CA and will continue to do so, yet no politicians will address the problem for fear of losing the oh so precious latino vote. Latinos drove my parents&rsquo; property value down to nothing by destroying the surrounding area, reducing it to a gang ridden hole. I was afraid to walk home from school every day, and would never go back for fear of subjecting my children to the same conditions I endured.</p>
<p>I started noticing things were getting out of hand when the old man down the street died and two Mexican families moved in to a single home. This was followed by yet more Mexican families moving into this ONE house, leaving their children to roam  our once safe streets causing senseless property damage and endangering our young. I swear it&rsquo;s a plague that no one should have to endure any further. </p>
<p>Why is this issue not being given the coverage it deserves. This is America for god&rsquo;s sake. I can&rsquo;t believe that a group of people  can have the audacity to come to our country illegally, wave their home countries flag around proudly, and trash our once nice communities without any reprecussions. Really?</p>

<p>First, I would like to say welcome to our Amren family!</p>
<p>Second, I too lived in California. Ever since I was a little girl I wanted to move to California. When I was growing up in the 70&rsquo;s most people I knew wanted to move there, too.</p>
<p>So I got my chance in the late 2000&rsquo;s. I lived there 1 year and left. Why? Illegal immigration! </p>
<p>Everywhere I went the Hispanics were speaking Spanish  &mdash;  on the bus, in the stores, on the streets, etc. It made me feel like I was living in another country.</p>
<p>Also, the areas they dominated in numbers always looked run down to me. They seem to bring a Third World energy with them to the U.S.</p>
<p>I was so saddened because I realized that California changed drastically from what it was decades ago. I knew there were a lot of Hispanics and Third Worlders in California before I moved. However, the city I moved to still had a large White population and many parts were affluent. To see it being invaded by Third Worlders was scary and upsetting, to say the least.</p>
<p>Everyone must join Numbers USA to fight against illegal immigration and call for a drastic reduction in legal immigration. This is the only way to turn back this invasion.<br>

&#8220;I&rsquo;m not surprised. When I go to my local Wal-Mart, usually it is full of short, portly Mexican women with 2-4 kids in tow. And this isn&rsquo;t Los Angeles, this is rural Tennessee.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>You know the Mexican illegal invasion is in its final stages when rural areas in states like Tennessee are taking notice. I suspect we&rsquo;re rapidly approaching the point of no return with this Mexican invasion. As one reader so aptly stated, even if our immigration laws were enforced 100% (what&rsquo;s the likelihood of that happening?) enforced, the &#8220;inner immigration&#8221; will destroy this country within a few decades. </p>
<p>The reckless breeding habits of these Mexican invaders, aided and abetted by a government all too willing to subsidize this behavior (in an effort to displace the dwindling white majority) will be the death of this nation as we know it.</p>
<p>I see a Yugoslav type conflict breaking out within a decade. Maybe that will be our saving grace, since the politicians currently representing us do not have the moral courage or character to stop this Mexican invasion we find ourselves besieged with.</p>

		<p> The illegals could be deported. These children cannot be. And they are children. I&rsquo;m not a liberal or anything close but I&rsquo;m not at the point where deporting anchor babies is attractive to me. I want them to leave[with their illegal parents] until they are adults and then return. I know its sounds &#8220;weak&#8221; but the law and fairness are important to me for personal reasons. I want the law &#8220;amended&#8221; or whatever is necesscary to make it clear that in the future that you must be born to two citizen parents to gain citizenship automatically at birth.<br>
 In my personal opinion, whether most readers realize it or not deporting anchor babies is a very bad precedent. For starters, it allows the federal government to assign worth to citizens on the basis of &#8220;average number of generations&#8221; a certain ethnic group has been in America. This is very stupid idea. Worth should be determined by value not by ancestry. In other words, I prefer the Austrian immigrant engineer to the Sicilian ditchdigger peon regardless of the amount of time their ancestors have contributed/leeched from me and mine.</p>

		<p>To poster #15, I wonder the same thing.  I&rsquo;m from the rural upper midwest.  Last time I went to visit the folks, there was so much &#8216;diversity&rsquo; that I was awe struck.  There had been ZERO non-whites in that town u until about five years ago.  Suddenly, every sixth person you see are black, latino, asian - where did they all come from so fast?  Why did so many specifically want to settle in that town, where there&rsquo;s not really any jobs?</p>

		<p><i>If we would just lose the selfish, baby-boomer mentality and have more children, this would not be an issue. I place the blame for the decline of our birthrate squarely where it belongs, on all the anti-family egocentric attitudes of the Boomers.</i> </p>
<p>Your assertions are presumptuous, sanctimonious and wrong. Do you have children?  Are you white?  Do you have a clue how expensive it is to raise children when we parents must pay for everything ourselves without government help?  Unlike non-whites, we whites aren&rsquo;t handed everything by the government such as free housing, food, medical care, transportation and education.  WE must pay for these things ourselves while being heavily taxed to pay for welfare recipients and their large broods, therefore forcing us to limit the number of children to what we can afford, which for most of us whites is one or two at most.</p>
<p><i>How can we be angry at hispanics for doing what God tells us to do, i.e. be fruitful and multiply?</i></p>
<p>Because they receive massive government benefits.  </p>
<p><i>But this would require personal sacrifice and inconvenience, something the Boom generation just can&rsquo;t tolerate.</i></p>
<p>Personal sacrifice?  No, I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about that as I struggle to keep my head above water in this economy and pray that my job won&rsquo;t disappear while I&rsquo;m taxed so that mexicans and blacks can pump out large numbers of children that they cannot afford.</p>

Admit the obvious. South Africa was a mistake as was Rhodesia. Now look what you have gone and done allowing a continental animalistic black race to completely take over and wipe out a white European nation. <br>
Its their continent. This is their assigned home. Why would you be surprised at what occured? <br>
Same with the western hemisphere who made the catastropihc mistake of going to African jungles and buying off rejects from tribal chiefs by the tens of millions to be used in the new west when they werent even needed.<br>
Whites could have simply used to red indians to do all the work and even paid them wages instead of enslaving them since they werent killed off as they should have been.<br>

<p>Many never allowed it. Many voted against it. Many fought in the army against it, some even voluntarily. Many tried to spread the message. Many tried to be politically active. Some planted bombs. Many did not use black labor. Still those many were too few against the voice of treason, the flag-bearer right in front being the press. What should they have done? There is only so much that is humanly possible.</p>
<p>And those that saw the light early, say in 1992, should they have emigrated? Well I can tell you now back then a white South African was the skunk of the world. If it is hard emigrating today, it was even harder back then.</p>

<p>Unlike most posts I&rsquo;m reading, I believe the Hispanic/Latino invasion will benefit Whites in the end, providing safer areas for Whites&hellip;&hellip;finally. </p>
<p>As I stated in a previous post, Hispanics are generally hard-working people with good values and they very much get along with Whites. They are not very fond of blacks, to put it mildly. I&rsquo;m in NY and just like in most states, blacks try to take advantage of Hispanics (Mexicans primarily) by robbing them knowing they carry cash&hellip;.from WORKING! </p>
<p>Go to youtube or google 1990 Inglewood and you&rsquo;ll see how blacks starting their nonsense even back then with Mexicans&hellip;.with that black power.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Hispanics STAND UP to blacks. They have turned areas in NY (and I know elsewhere) nice again&hellip;or at least better, as the blacks have practically ran out once the numbers were not to their benefit (big surprise!)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an American born Italian married to a Latina. This is NOT why I&rsquo;m saying this, however. I believed this (and saw this) long before. </p>
<p>I noticed the changes in the 90s and predicted a black vs brown race war. </p>
<p>The browns starting taking over and it was bound to happen&hellip;since blacks are as racist as anyway, if not more.</p>
<p>Remember, generally speaking, hispanics have heavy European roots. Also, they don&rsquo;t practice VooDoo and they don&rsquo;t throw their babies in dumpsters!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>As a side note, I taught in a heavily Mexican school a few years ago. The kids are very good and so were the parents. Nothing ghetto happening with those kids or parents. The school used to be mostly black. The teachers who were there for 10+ years all said the same about the change: It&rsquo;s like night and day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I know there are too many immigrants coming over. I&rsquo;m just saying that the reality is they are not going back AND they WILL be our ally&hellip;.and a VERY VERY strong one. <br>

		<p>  The birth rate for Mexicans is declining but not for Mexican Americans here in the United States. The fact remains that millions of Mexicans want to escape the violence and chaos of their crime ravished country. It is self-evident that areas of the United States are becoming &#8220;Colonia&rsquo;s&#8221; of Mexico, where Hispanic immigrants no longer assimilate but retain their language, culture and mores. No one asked the American people if they wanted to be a Latin American country  &mdash;  our greedy, multicultural-loving elites decided for us.</p>

More to the point, the last thing we white Americans need to do is try to outbreed the Mexicans; it would be a futile struggle and carrying-capacity disaster.  Instead, let us refuse the Mexicans admission by (for starters) repealing the birthright clause misinterpretation. </p>
<p>If Mexicans want to create quiverfulls of criminals, drug dealers and welfare supplicants, let them go about such business back home in Mexico.  </p>

I am sick of ANY 3rd world immigration and NONE should ever become a citizen. I also don&rsquo;t care if they are &#8220;children&#8221;&hellip;they grow up real quick and hate us just the same.

<p>Politicians are so cowardly in speaking up on this problem, they don&rsquo;t want to offend the Latino population.  But they have no problem offending us and they have no problem welcoming them into our country on the sly.  If the political leaders wanted to do something about them they would certainly know dozens of surreptious, underhanded, quiet ways of keeping them out.  They deceive us but they will not do anything against the illegals.  Politicians spend most of their time trying to pull the wool over our eyes but they will not use their many devious skills to stop the invasion of our country.</p>

<p>No reasonable person would ever believe the framers would have intended to bestow US citizenship to the offspring of those who entered this country in violation of our immigration laws! A country founded on the principle of law nonetheless! </p>
<p>Anchor babies are faux US citizens, costing this country millions of dollars a year and need to be deported along with their illegal invading mestizo, so called &ldquo;parents.&rdquo;</p>
