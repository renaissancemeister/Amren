<h1>Two Shot After Fireworks Show in Grand Rapids</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WWMT (Grand Rapids), July 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A night of celebration in Grand Rapids turned violent following a spectacular fireworks show downtown. </p>
<p>After the fireworks, shots rang out and two men were wounded. Police in Grand Rapids are currently searching for those responsible for the gunfire. </p>
<p>Just minutes after the fireworks ended along the Grand River, chaos erupted on Monroe Center as a concert was still going. </p>
<p>The fight started in the middle of the street. Video obtained from an onlooker by Newschannel 3 suggests that several women had started brawling, and then things got crazy. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fight seems to slow down in the next minute, and then shots rang out. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police are still looking for the shooter and witnesses say a black male, about 17-years-old, wearing a gray baseball hat, black shirt and shorts was seen running from the scene down Pearl St.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Grand Rapids is a heavily Dutch-ethnic city.  Yet somehow I didn&rsquo;t think the shootings were the work of someone raised in a Reformed Calvinist home.  Amazing!!  I was right.  The perp is black.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Extremely disappointing,&#8221; the reporter says. &#8220;I&rsquo;m extremely disappointed&#8221;, the cop (shill) says&hellip;Yeah, &#8220;The downtown is an extremely safe area.&#8221; What a job&hellip;to have to lick boots and lie like that to keep your pay! (Ever notice we can only be &#8220;disappointing with black mob behavior, never outraged? <br>
We tend to be disappointed&#8221; with errant children and inferiors who we must tend to&hellip;Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s words in action! White Man&rsquo;s Burden, indeed.</p>
<p>And the guy who filmed this. Not exactly the paragon of white virtue. I&rsquo;d sneer at him for looking part EMO, part Wannabee Black, and Part LOSER.<br>
Just sadness, all around. Degraded, decadent, without virtue or worth.</p>
<p>Oh, and the priceless howls as soon as the mob hears gunshots.<br>
Always on que, there&hellip;cowardice, group violence, delighting at the sight and smell of blood, then pants- peeing,, screaming retreat, arms flailing, no human dignity to be found.</p>
<p>How pathetic!</p>
<p>On a side note, glad those shot will recover, and I hope it is a good recovery.<br>
Getting shot really sucks.</p>

<p>Says it all about the &#8220;great&#8221; civil rights movement.  We reap what we have sown. That and the 1965 Immigration Act put the nail in the coffin of White America as it was INTENDED to do. Those Southern Whites who protested the integration of blacks upon Whites need to be applauded, yet they are vilified at every turn. EVERY White in this nation should have been doing what they did, but most had no courage or conviction. Now we are paying for it. </p>

		<p>How many riot/fight videos have been on one media outlet or another lately?  </p>
<p>Too many to keep track of.  And they all involve blacks.</p>
<p>The Color of Crime broke crime stats down by race.  I&rsquo;d like to see somebody put together stats on how many incidents of fighting, rioting and violence involve blacks, aside and apart from the usual crime figures.</p>

		<p>At first glance, I thought it was Detroit. This was in Grand Rapids?! Blacks will be blacks will be blacks, no matter WHERE they are.</p>
<p>The police chief saying &#8220;our downtown is extremely safe&#8221;, while the rampage is going on - priceless!</p>
<p>Not for one second did I think that Obama&rsquo;s election was going to make episodes like this, a thing of the past.</p>

		<p>The only two groups of women whom I have seen behave this way in my entire life are blacks and lower castes of India who unsurprisingly are part black. It&rsquo;s just plain ugly. The lower castes are actually way better than blacks.</p>
<p>Women from other group tend to have dignified behaviour of varying degrees but these people are exceptional. I&rsquo;ll have to say that these kinds of behaviour definitely have more to do with intelligence and very little to nothing to do with class/education &amp; what not.</p>
<p>Event violent males who are intelligent tend to behave more decently. I almost always remark whenever I notice a black customer service rep that blacks rarely smile &amp; generally have a serious/aggressive expression. Black women seem to worse when it comes to customer service compared to black men.</p>

		<p>When I was in high school, two black girls got into a fight over a boy and nearly tore each others shirts totally off.  It was the most vicious fist fight I ever saw&hellip; including fights between men. </p>
<p>Years later I was telling the story to a bunch of students and one of the students told me I was racist because I mentioned that the fighters were both black.  My how far we have come!  </p>

		<p>@4: Having lived through the 60s and the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement in the South, I say you are spot on. </p>
<p>The reason the Southerners reacted the way they did is that they had decades of experience living closely with blacks. They knew how blacks are. They knew that the &#8220;grand experiment&#8221; was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>But, as usual, you will NEVER hear from the elites that the Southerners were right even though current events are underscoring that fact daily!!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;and then things got crazy&#8221;.  This is the usual level of what passes for journalism these days.  Also, it&rsquo;s a way to mitigate and/or avoid saying exactly what the battling black women did.</p>

		<p>When you live in big American cities with large - Black underclass populations, you learn many survival skills - what and where to avoid.</p>
<p>One thing we need to explain to all White people is to avoid any and all night time, free fire works displays with large crowds. Don&rsquo;t ever be surprised when there is trouble, violence with such crowds.  </p>
<p>A good stance on the 4th of July is to be pro White British - don&rsquo;t be a fool and try to join the Black underclass crowds celebrating the way they always do.</p>
<p>Or else work with local authorities to have day time patriotic celebrations about American history - the Black underclass doesn&rsquo;t go for this. Other things to do is to only go to places where there are barriers to entry, $ tickets to get in.  Think like a British upper class White person in the colonies in the late 18th century. Avoid crowds/mobs and don&rsquo;t be surprised when there is trouble/violence.</p>

		<p>Fights between black females have never been unusual. I remember witnessing one (from a distance)outside a community center in Hartford Connecticut in 1964. Two black girls were fighting over a boy. Someone handed one of the girls a knife and she killed the other.</p>

B)The reporter says people are &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with the melee. Disappointed? Remember Kevin Kline in &#8220;A Fish Called Wanda&#8221;,when he is enraged at the bufoonery of his partner: &#8220;DISAPPOINTED!!!&#8221; </p>

		<p>@12.  In regards to the &#8220;Respct thing&#8221;.  This is a cut and paste from a book review of  &#8220;The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-Man&#8221;</p>
<p>In this classic 1922 book, Dr. Lothrop Stoddard examines the point where egalitarian revolutionary movements  &mdash;  particularly the French Revolution and its ultimate offspring in the 20th century, the Bolshevik revolution  &mdash;  intersect with human biodiversity. His thesis is that civilisation imposes increasing intellectual and moral burdens on the less able strata of the population, causing growing frustration, restlessness, and FEELINGS of WORTHLESSNESS among their members, who, meanwhile and due to differential birthrates, grow in number and proportion; eventually, when the pressure becomes unbearable, they rise up in revolt &mdash;  a revolt against civilisation. Stoddard examines the gradual depletion of cognitive and moral capital from the population due to low fertility among elites and high fertility among the underclasses; the role and methods of &#8216;tainted geniuses&rsquo; in mobilising discontent, particularly during the French and Bolshevik revolutions; and the ticking dysgenic time-bomb in the United States.</p>

		<p> If whites are to survive they must create their own neighborhoods and schools and keep everybody else out. There are a lot of integrated neighborhoods in the country but there are also a lot of  white neighborhoods. White neighborhood town councils must vote to keep the neighborhood white, a whites only zone. The beauty of this is you won&rsquo;t have to kick anybody out. Sure you&rsquo;ll be called a racist but we should have a right to what kind of neighborhood we live in. It should be our right.</p>
