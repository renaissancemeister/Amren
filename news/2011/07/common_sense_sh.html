<h1><a href="https://www.coachisright.com/common-sense-shows-guns-dont-kill-people-blacks-do/">Common Sense Shows Guns Don&rsquo;t Kill People, Blacks Do!</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Book, Coach is Right, July 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p> The right to own a firearm &#8220;is subject to common sense regulation just like most of our rights are subject to common sense regulation,&#8221; said candidate Obama in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;The City of Chicago has gun laws, so does Washington, DC,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The notion that somehow local jurisdictions can&rsquo;t initiate gun safety laws to deal with gangbangers and random shootings on the street isn&rsquo;t borne out by our Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Because to the left, &#8220;&hellip;there is a regular relationship between the availability of weapons to the general public and the rate at which crime[s] occur&hellip;&#8221; In short,  more guns=more crime, irrespective of who owns them.</p>
<p>It is a belief which bears no resemblance to the facts.</p>
<p>Gun ownership is &#8220;higher among Whites than among Blacks,  higher among middle aged people than among young people,  higher among married people than among unmarried people,  higher among richer people than poor&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the fallacy of &#8220;more guns=more crime,&#8221; those most likely to be gun wielding American killers are well-to-do, White, middle aged married men and women!</p>
<p>But the fact is, more guns do NOT result in more crime. Guns in the hands of criminals result in more crime. And in the US and elsewhere,  the majority of those hands are Black.</p>
<p>Department of Justice statistics for 2005 show that Blacks, who made up 12.1% of the population, accounted for 52.2% of murders. Whites, including Latinos, represented 74.7% of the population and committed 45.8% of murders.</p>
<p>This translates to 24.7 murders committed per 100,000 blacks. {snip}</p>
<p>When Anglo whites are separated from Latino Whites, the figures show 7.73 murders per 100,000 Latino-whites and 2.63 murders per 100,000 Anglo-Whites.</p>
<p>If Mr. Obama is determined to add to the nation&rsquo;s bloated thicket of firearms legislation,  &#8220;common sense&#8221;  dictates he suspend efforts against the law abiding,  independent,  White,  middle aged,  married gun owner  &mdash;  the dedicated target of the past 50 years of gun control legislation.</p>
<p>Instead, &#8220;common sense&#8221; should be exchanged for HONEST and gun crime addressed where it occurs and by whom it is committed.</p>

		<p>This story reminds me of the time when I took my concealed weapons permit class.  Just about all white men and a few white women. I was early in the afternoon. The class included the firing of a gun. There was one rather large black fellow in the class. He was drinking a 16 oz plastic cup of beer.  Common sense would tell me that is not a good idea.  But if he had been kicked out of the class he could always play the race card.  Funny I have heard that supposedly gun control laws were designed to keep black people from getting guns. Sounds like they were right.</p>

		<p>I have had guns in my home all my life and oddly this availability of weapons has never enticed me to go out and commit a crime. It may however, assist me in stopping a crime.</p>

		<p>Might want to ask this question. How many whites killed themselves with guns (or any other method) that year.  Research show that there are many more suicides in the USA than there are murders per year. White males are affected the most.</p>

		<p>Its not as though this statistical evidence is some surprising unknown revelation to anyone, its just that for some reason its taboo to speak of.  Why?  Why does our society continue to enable the African subculture with denial and a different set of standards?  Is it some sort of innate guilt like the way you feel about someone who is mentally disabled and you realize how better off you are?  We need to tighten up and force the change they are obviously not willing or able to make for themselves.    </p>

<p>The relevant state may have a law prohibiting simultaneous possession of a firearm and alcohol, or simultaneous possession of a firearm and an open container, or at least possession of a firearm while intoxicated.  If so, then there would have been the grounds to bounce him out of class, and the teachers could have hid behind such gun/booze laws pretty well.  Even in states that allow CCW inside bars, that doesn&rsquo;t override the gun/drink laws, i.e. those that carry inside a bar isn&rsquo;t allowed to drink.  As it is, someone in your entourage shouldn&rsquo;t be drinking anyway, designated driver.</p>

<p>Correct. When the pundits say that we have a very high crime rate in the U.S., what they mean to say is that among certain groups we have a very high crime rate but among the still predominant populace we have a VERY LOW crime rate.</p>
<p>Those certain groups being black folks and Spanish speakers. People including all the pundits know this to be true but just hesitate to use those words to describe the &#8220;persons&#8221; who are so criminally inclined, and in a violent way too.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s illegal in my state to be in possession of a firearm while drinking, or intoxicated. That black man drinking during the class should have been kicked out and arrested too. I don&rsquo;t doubt that it&rsquo;s that way in all 50 states and in every European nation too. Ever notice that many shootings and murders in general committed by non-whites also involve intoxication on the part of the offender, victim or both? This is one reason why I stopped drinking to excess more than twenty years ago. </p>

		<p> In short, more guns=more crime, irrespective of who owns them. (From the article)</p>
<p>In rebuttal, you might read the book &#8220;More Guns, Less Crime&#8221; by John R. Lott, Jr. It includes a fair amount of graphs and dry statistics, but the subject matter is right on the nose, and in detail and depth as to who and why. It is broken down by age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, and education. It all boils down to the fact that whites use their guns to prevent crime, and others use them to commit crime. </p>

		<p>Again, I am reading another article that discusses the diabolically evil and clearly sinister obsession on the part of our hostile, alien ruling elites to find some pretext, no matter how flimsy or erroneous, to justify more laws which seek to disarm the &#8216;citizens&rsquo; - and the comments thus far have missed the entire point of this obsession of our hostile ruling elites.  </p>
<p>Allow me to clarify this issue.  </p>
<p>Fact #1:  Our hostile ruling elites are not stupid; they fully understand that non-whites, especially blacks and mestizos, according to all available crime statistics and compiled data, far more likely to commit crimes where a firearm is involved.   AR readers might recall the study that came out a few years ago, where some white liberal who was a big fan of abortion wrote that, thanks to abortion, the inner-city crime rates weren&rsquo;t nearly as bad as they would have otherwise been due to the fact that lots of black male babies were aborted and therefore didn&rsquo;t grow up in fatherless families and carry on the ghetto gang banger traditions.  Well, that was about as close as the white liberal left has ever come to admitting the truth about minority crime statistics.</p>
<p>Fact #2:  The current crop of anti-white, virulently hostile ruling elites are literally consumed with a raw, deep-rooted hatred and disdain for both the old, traditional American nation and all it&rsquo;s institutions and traditions, as well as a hatred for the White European descendants of the 100 percent White European Founding Stock.  We have all taken note of the endless attempts by this same ruling elite to turn these un-Constitutional &#8216;Patriot Act&rsquo; laws and their sinister, totalitarian police state apparatus inward against&hellip;.whom?  White Americans, and in particular, racially healthy, racially conscious, racially awake white males.   Notice how the enemy controlled media and high ranking government elites are attempting to capitalize on the Norway tragedy  - and demonize the very legitimate writings of the Breivik suspect where he expressed anger at the hostile ruling elites of White Western nations using multiculturalism as a weapon to destroy their own European nations - and doing so in direct and vehement opposition from the vast majority of Whites in those nations.   These concerns, as expressed in Breivik&rsquo;s writings should not be rendered invalid simply because of his clearly criminal decision to step outside the law and commit horrific criminal acts - but, that is what the mainstream, enemy controlled media is attempting to do.   Don&rsquo;t fall for it. Breivik&rsquo;s crimes were abhorrent; his concerns for the survival of White European people were not - so, do NOT allow either our media enemies or our hostile ruling elites to muddle these two issues and try to insinuate that unless whites embrace their genocide plans we are the same as Breivik.</p>
<p>Fact #3:   The primary reason why these hostile ruling elites are now trying to demonize and categorize white males, including white males who are military veterans who are returning home from all these wars that we&rsquo;ve been lied into, as &#8216;potential domestic terrorists&rsquo; is because we represent the biggest obstacle to their clearly transparent plans to recreate the USSR right here in North America.  Of all the demographic groups considered, whites and white males are the most passionate supporters of the original U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights that existed prior to 9-11.   The First and Second Amendments are particularly important to this segment of our society, and these hostile elites despise both of those liberties intensely and lust to abolish them both.  </p>
<p>Fact #4:  White racial realists, such as those in the AR community and in the white nationalist community, also present an obstacle to the goal on the part of our hostile ruling elites to engineer the ethnic and cultural genocide of White European people and the destruction of White, Western Civilization.    We, and we alone, are willing to stand up for, and speak out in favor of, the simple truth that whites, just like every other ethnic group, have legitimate interests and concerns that are specific to our race and ethnic group.    Opposing and resisting the efforts by our hostile elites to reduce us to minority status and thereby render our people and our children and grandchildren to a permanent position of subjugation inside our own native and historic homelands, subject to being ruled over by a motley collection of non-whites from every failed third world society on Earth - these are perfectly LEGITIMATE concerns and we have every legal, moral, and justified right to oppose this evil agenda.</p>
<p>So, considering all of the above facts that I cited - the real reason our hostile ruling elites are so consumed with their lust to pass more and more gun control laws and to make it harder and harder for the most law-abiding demographic segment of our society to purchase and possess firearms - is because they want to strip law-abiding white males, who they despise and hate with such intensity, of their ability to defend themselves against (a) minority crime and (b) government tyranny, aka, what happened in the former USSR following the 1917 revolution.</p>
<p>Hence, do not be fooled by these transparent attempts by these enemy elites to cloak their gun control desires under the camouflage of being &#8220;concerned for the safety of our children&#8221; or for any other, liberal, leftist,  Utopian sounding mumbo-jumbo.    Never forget that these leftists and Cultural Marxists will lie, cheat, conspire and use any devious and underhanded means that they can think of - to try to advance their diabolically evil, anti-white, anti-Western, anti-freedom agenda.   </p>

<p>In the only real test case scenario in this country which is New Orleans the mayor suspended gun owning rights to New Orleans residents during the Katrina disaster. That does not bode well for our cause because it sets a precedent that says in time of dire distress and chaos we the government see fit to put your welfare in the hand of the cops who are quitting their jobs in droves because they can&rsquo;t cope.</p>

 I would add that we have not only a right to oppose, but a duty to do so. I have never seen a bigger threat to our way of life in all of my 55 years in America. It makes the atom bomb drills and scares of my childhood look like a picnic.</p>

It has been said that &#8220;a man with a gun is a citizen and a man without one is a subject.&#8221; It is much easier for a tyrant to rule a nation of unarmed subjects than armed citizens. Our Second Amendment was not written as a measure to protect hunting or sport. It was written so law-abiding citizens could protect themselves from two legged predators on our streets and in our governments. If the Second Amendment is ever repealed, the last major hurdle preventing the rise of a left-wing dictatorship will have been cleared. This is a fight we must not lose.</p>

		<p>I strongly urge Amren readers not to become obsessed with 2nd Amendment gun rights as the solution to all our racial problems. It&rsquo;s similar to the Pro Life issue - we are racial realists - so we want to prevent criminal Blacks from carrying and using guns or having lots of children.</p>
<p>There is a reason Whites in places like New York the Bronx and South Side of Chicago aren&rsquo;t generally hard core gun rights, pro life Republicans: we don&rsquo;t want certain populations around us to have full gun rights and have lots and lots of children. That might sound RACIST to some and I get this all the time at gun shows in conservative Red State areas - personal liberties that are good for healthy White folks are not good for inner city Black folks, or 3rd world non Whites in places like Somalia or Haiti.</p>
<p>It was the same for the French Revolution ideas of Liberty, Brotherhood and Equality - these ideas didn&rsquo;t translate very well to the French island of Santo Domingo/Haiti.</p>

		<p>In my part of the country, the Wisconsin Northwoods, there is at least one gun in every household. Most have multiple including handguns, shotguns, and high powered rifles.  Yet this area has extremely low crime and even lower gun related crime.  Suppose it has anything to do with the population demographics not the guns themselves?</p>

		<p>[quote]We have all taken note of the endless attempts by this same ruling elite to turn these un-Constitutional &lsquo;Patriot Act&rsquo; laws and their sinister, totalitarian police state apparatus inward against&hellip;.whom? White Americans, and in particular, racially healthy, racially conscious, racially awake white males. Notice how the enemy controlled media and high ranking government elites are attempting to capitalize on the Norway tragedy - and demonize the very legitimate writings of the Breivik suspect where he expressed anger at the hostile ruling elites of White Western nations using multiculturalism as a weapon to destroy their own European nations - and doing so in direct and vehement opposition from the vast majority of Whites in those nations. These concerns, as expressed in Breivik&rsquo;s writings should not be rendered invalid simply because of his clearly criminal decision to step outside the law and commit horrific criminal acts - but, that is what the mainstream, enemy controlled media is attempting to do. Don&rsquo;t fall for it. Breivik&rsquo;s crimes were abhorrent; his concerns for the survival of White European people were not - so, do NOT allow either our media enemies or our hostile ruling elites to muddle these two issues and try to insinuate that unless whites embrace their genocide plans we are the same as Breivik.[/quote]</p>
<p>the elites controlling the media are attempting to conflate the unlawful actions of the suspect with his writings and evident beliefs, convictions, politics. however, they ignore the real terrorists committing such crimes for religious/political belief reasons on a regular basis: muslims. when it is a muslim, they run out and scream &#8220;not all muslims are like that&#8221; and they defend the reasons they are like that as &#8220;their civil rights&#8221;, but when (they say) Breivik did it, they scream &#8220;all Whites are evil!&#8221;.</p>

The IRS can&rsquo;t neither audit nor arrest everyone. We still have the numbers now all we need are the stones. <br>
The same for guns. If every White person in Philly for example bought a gun and learned it&rsquo;s safe &amp; sane use then began to carry on the streets permit or no permit, Philly PD hasn&rsquo;t the ability to arrest everyone and if we have a few dozen DOA Flash Mob &#8220;youfs&#8221;, all the better.</p>

<p>I agree.  2nd Amendment can sometimes be the opiate of the American right wing masses.  Furthermore, it, like a lot of other similar distractions, (i.e. religion, sports, and the thing which happens to be my opiate, conventional partisan politics of the banal &#8220;red team blue team&#8221; variety), can make our minds genuflect to anti-racist mentalities, if we&rsquo;re not careful.  Hint:  If I see one more essay or blog post about &#8220;gun control and racism,&#8221; I think I might give up my supper.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re thinking there&rsquo;s too much &#8220;second amendment absolutism,&#8221; there is not.  The NRA supports felon-in-possession prohibitions, and most of those who don&rsquo;t support it still do support violent felon in possession prohibitions, but don&rsquo;t think ticky tack felonies should disqualify firearm ownership.  As a matter of fact, &#8220;felon in possession&#8221; enforcement is one of the most important workhorses in Federal law, not only because it&rsquo;s used to rid ghetto streets of certain ne&rsquo;er-do-wells for a few extra years, but because the threat of enforcement is used as a sword of Damocles to extract snitching from the &#8220;no snitching&#8221; crowd.</p>
<p>Any concentrated law enforcement efforts to enforce &#8220;felon in possession&#8221; laws in ghettoes where doing so would/does lead to appreciable benefit almost always meets with noisy opposition from black politicians and cracker jack box preachers and civil rights loudmouths, and even the professional gun control crowd can&rsquo;t be counted on to support them.</p>
<p>Also, in spite of my initial predictions, I have not yet received the kind of vicious blow black that I thought I would get when I came out in opposition to permit-free &#8220;constitutional carry&#8221; laws in states with an appreciable black or Hispanic population.  Having carrying restricted to those who get permits, i.e. having permitless carry still be a crime, is like felon-in-possession, a valuable law enforcement sword of Damocles to get thug blacks to snitch and rat.  That became clear when I saw an episode of &#8220;The First 48&#8221; a few months ago.</p>

		<p>#26 Anonymous sounds like an Anarchist.  Usually these types are the biggest cowards, always hiding behind a govt. overthrow or a revolution to accomplish their agenda, instead of seeking solutions and causing change lawfully and peacefully through the system.  But working through the system - that takes too much effort, iamgination and intelligence, I guess, so let&rsquo;s just start shooting and whoever&rsquo;s left standing, they win.  Real smart.</p>

		<p>Jack in Chicago &amp; Question diversity: The flaw in your logic is in thinking that criminal blacks, in cities with stringent gun laws, obey those laws. The evidence is resoundingly clear that the illegal possession of guns abound in the inner cities of places like New York, Chicago, and Washington DC, in spite of stringent gun laws. </p>

<p>Of course I know that convicted felons have a hard time following any kinds of laws.  My point is that &#8220;Exile Projects,&#8221; or other similar efforts, to enforce felon-in-possession laws exists because felonious blacks do (illegally) have guns, and the laws are used either to get them off the streets for a few years to deter a few of their crimes or to use that as leverage to get them to tell what they know about other more serious crimes.</p>
<p>As a aside, news this morning is that Gov. Quinn has signed a bill making state level felon in possession as much as a 10 year bid.  This is the same Quinn who pardoned a bunch of murderers a few years ago, because of the lack of prison space.  So to me the intent is clear   &mdash;   Use the &#8220;ten years in prison&#8221; threat as a sword of Damocles to get Chicago and ESL blacks to snitch, hoping they don&rsquo;t catch wise to the trick.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity: We may actually be agreeing but not fully understanding the others position. I&rsquo;m an NRA member, a CCW permit holder, and an ardent &#8220;gun guy.&#8221; I associate with many others like myself. I don&rsquo;t know anyone who thinks convicted felons should be allowed to legally posses a firearm. But, I have read articles, by gun control advocates, who try to paint individuals like myself as opposed to all gun laws, even those laws preventing convicted felons from owning them. The only way for the gun control groups to win, is if they convince enough voters that people like me are the extremists, by grossly distorting our views. When law abiding citizens are denied the right to carry a firearm, the criminals (black, brown or white) will still be carrying.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the nature of warfare, or politics, which, to turn Clausewitz upside down, is war by any other means.  Your imperative is to portray your opponents as slack jaw extremists.  We do it to them, they do it to us.</p>
<p>The reality is that the Brady type professional gun grabber groups technically support felon-in-possession enforcement putsches in black ghettos, but only reluctantly.  That is because the professional gun grabbers are hooked into the Democrat Party which has black voters in its base.</p>
